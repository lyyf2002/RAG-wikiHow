Practice quitting in a mirror.,
Schedule a time to meet with your boss.,
Explain that you wish to resign.,
Agree upon a timeline for your departure.,
Hand over the letter.",How to Resign Nicely2," Practice having the conversation with yourself, in order to alleviate any fears that you may be having toward quitting. Change can be stressful, but have faith that you are working toward a better future opportunity.

, It is best to do this early on in the day, as the boss may have a lot on her or his plate. Tell your boss that you need to discuss a private matter, and ask when would be a convenient time for them to meet. Work around their schedule and respect that they may push the meeting to the following day., Tell your boss that would like to inform him or her of the reasons why you are leaving the position, whether it is a promotion in title elsewhere, an offer of more money or better conditions elsewhere, or poor treatment in your current role. Be as honest and forthright as possible.Keep the conversation friendly, but remain firm in your intention.
If asked for other reasons relating to interactions or working relationships, be cautious in what you say and discuss them if such reasons are significant to your experience at the workplace., If there is a big project that must be wrapped up before you leave, it is respectful to stay until it is completed. Your final day can be discussed and negotiated so that you can reach a compromise that works both for you and for your boss.Offer to help transition another person into your role, if time allows. Many companies promote from within, so feel free to recommend a fellow co-worker whom you feel would be suitable to fill your shoes. Giving them some training before you leave your position can help ease the transition for everyone.

, Thank them for the opportunities you have had with the company, and, if you would like, ask them whether you can use their name as a work reference in the future. Agree upon a date for your last day of work and shake their hand after the conversation."

Be positive about your employer, colleagues, and manager.,
Choose what you want to share with employees.,
Exchange contact information.",How to Resign Nicely3," This will enable you to keep a network of associates who may help you find a new job at a future time, even if simply through offering their name as a work reference., If you are leaving for personal reasons, you can decide whether or not you want to share your plans with co-workers. However, if you are leaving due to issues with management or poor treatment by someone, you may want to be more private about the circumstances. Above all, handle the situation in a mature and professional manner and try to stay optimistic, since they must still work there.If other employees may be in danger of abuse by a boss, you can privately warn them of your experiences. However, you should do this after work so as not to get them into trouble.

, Give your mailing address, personal email, or cell phone number to any co-workers whom you would like to stay in touch with after your departure. Keep in mind that your work email will expire, so they will no longer be able to reach you there."

Update your resume to highlight your experience.,
Submit your resume and/or application to make sure you are considered.,
Wait for an interview.",How to Reapply for Your Own Job1," The last resume you submitted to your company does not include your current position. It is important to add this experience to your resume so you can look good on paper and present your value to the company.


Be sure to add your key duties and accomplishments, including any quantifiable results.
For example, “Implemented new tracking system to reduce mistakes by 30%”.;
, Depending on how your company handles the hiring process, you may need to either apply for your job by submitting your resume and/or filling out an application form (online or paper).


Whatever the case may be, it is important to complete all requirements in their entirety.
This means answering all questions and providing all information necessary.

, Once you have followed the application procedure, it is time to wait until you are called to interview for your job. At this time it is important to be patient. This is a lot of work for those running this procedure and they have to figure out all the details before reaching out to applicants for an interview.


It will not look favorable if you keep asking about your potential interview.

"
"
Don’t assume you will be rehired.,
Remain professional and follow interviewing best practices.,
Explain your day to day duties truthfully.,
Show your value to increase your chances of being kept.",How to Reapply for Your Own Job2," You must take this situation seriously! Just because you already have this job and you feel you are great at it, does not mean the company will keep you. Throughout this process, the company has the ability to either hire someone they feel is more suited for the job or eliminate your position all together.


The first step to taking this process seriously is to not assume you will easily be rehired.
If you do not have the mindset that you “own” the job, you will be more willing to follow the process and compete vigorously for your job.
If you do not take the process seriously you will risk losing your job.

, It is important to remain professional and treat the process as if you are applying for a job at a new company. This may be difficult if you know the person interviewing you, but the truth is that you are there to impress them, remind them why you were chosen for the job in the first place and describe your success in this role thus far.


Follow interview best practices such as dressing professionally, wearing a smile, providing a strong handshake, listening actively to the interviewer, bringing a copy of your resume and preparing to speak about yourself (job duties, accomplishments, abilities, knowledge, strengths and your desire to keep your job).

, You may find yourself having to explain what you really do during the day versus what is written in the job description. Sometimes these are two very different things and the interviewer may be surprised at the tasks you complete without formal documentation.


For example, your job may be to receive technical complaints, issues and inquiries from software users. Once you receive this information, you pass it over to the IT techs that can help. You do not answer or resolve anything.
When you are asked, “what do you do here” it will be false to say or even imply that you provide some level of tech support when in actuality you do not.
Whatever the case may be, it is important to not exaggerate what you do. Giving false accounts of what you do to make you seem more vital will eventually catch up to you and may cause a negative impact.

, As with any other interview it is important to express your strengths and accomplishments most relevant to the role. Since you already know what the role entails, you are at an advantage because all you need to do is explain what you have contributed to the company while in this role.


The easiest way to show your value is by quantifying your accomplishments and providing specific examples of what you have done and what the results were.
For example, you were able to implement a new campaign that targeted new customers in the southeast region which increased sales by 35% within 2 months.

"
"
Keep your feelings under control.,
Volunteer for extra projects and tasks.,
Actively participate in meetings.,
Strengthen your work relationships.,
Be patient during the decision making process.",How to Reapply for Your Own Job3," When you are notified you will have to reapply for your job, it is normal to have mixed emotions. This is a very stressful situation and you have every right to feel offended, angry, anxious, nervous and/or upset. No matter how you are feeling from the time you are notified through the decision process, it is important to remain calm at work and not let your emotions make matters worse.


If you are overwhelmed by your emotions you may regret your actions, which may present a negative impression and minimize your chances of keeping your job.

, While it may seem you are sucking up by volunteering for extra projects, it is important to offer your assistance and show initiative. During company changes, coworkers and supervisors may be pulled in multiple directions and may need a helping hand until things calm down.


If you recognize the need for assistance and sincerely offer to help, you will be seen as loyal and dedicated to the company, your department and/or team.
For example, your supervisor is very involved in the new and potential company changes and does not have time to head up weekly team meetings. You are the most senior employee on your team and have the leadership quality to head up the meetings in your supervisor’s absence.
Offering to assist with this task will take something off of your supervisor’s plate and will be noted during your reapplication process.

, You want to make your value to the company known. Even though you are not in an interview, you must use any time spent with decision makers to your advantage by actively participating in meetings and sharing your ideas.


In doing so, you will offer your expertise and express your value to the company and hopefully get some extra points.
For example, you contributed to the discussion about expanding markets during a meeting with your team, supervisor and the director of your department. You shared your idea of reaching out to a particular target market that is untapped and can benefit from the product. Expressing this insight can show your ability to think strategically and offer new ideas to benefit the company.

, It is important to always develop, strengthen and maintain working relationships with coworkers and management both inside and outside of your department. It is more so important to do this during a time of uncertainty with the company.


Having sincere and strong working relationships can help others view you as an integral part of the company with ties to various areas.
When there is turmoil in the company and people are trying to hold their jobs, there is no shame in leveraging these relationships to your benefit by remaining a positive contributor to the company and a true fit for the company culture.

, Staying calm and being patient will be very difficult during this time of uncertainty. If you are good at your job, provide great value to the company, and followed the steps listed above, you have done all you can do to keep your job.


It is now up to your employer and you must wait for that decision to be made. Stay positive and hang in there!

"
Offer real support.,
Don’t make light of the situation.,
Don’t offer advice.,
Keep the conversation focused on her.,
Follow up when the time is right.,
Avoid discussing the situation with your boss.,
Avoid gossip.,
Let the dust settle.,
Perform better and more reliably.",How to React when a Coworker Is Fired," Many people will feel the urge to ignore the situation or offer platitudes. Resist this. The last thing your colleague wants to hear is that their firing must have a silver lining or is somehow “for the best.” At the same time, though, don’t ignore the situation. They will appreciate positive words of sympathy or, even better, offers of concrete assistance.Rather than telling your co-worker, “Don’t worry, you’ll get a great job soon,” try a something simple and empathetic. “I’m sorry” or “Let me know how I can help” is much better.
Make a real offer to help. Can you help their revamp their resume? Maybe he'd/she’d like you to give him/her a mock interview? Or would they just like to get together for coffee? This can make more of a difference than words.;
, While offering affirming words, avoid at all cost jokes, dark humor, or a response that minimizes the situation. Your co-worker has just been fired. They are probably distraught and possibly angry or in shock. One of the most unfeeling things you can do in this situation is to make light of it, because this could make it seem like their emotions don’t matter. Saying, “You’re lucky to get out of this dump,” for example, or joking about how much free time he'll/she’ll have is tactless.Respect the space, as well. Try to read the body language from them – you may see that they are having a hard emotional time. In that case, don’t pain him/her with a long conversation or press him/her to go out to lunch or other things.

, Another natural response to seeing a colleague fired is to want to “fix things.” Resist this urge, too. In a way, getting fired is like experiencing a death in the family. Your co-worker will too busy coming to terms with the loss to appreciate your opinion about how she/he should start up her/his own business or change fields. They will also not want your would-be advice about getting a better job.Rather than saying, “You know, there’s lots of jobs in health care – maybe you can get one there,” keep it concrete and helpful. Try something like, “Let me know if I can do anything. I’d be happy to look over your resume or read your cover letters.”

, Being empathetic requires you to give priority to another person’s feelings, and to listen to them. You are trying to offer emotional support to a co-worker and perhaps friend. Don’t make the conversation about you. Don’t recount a story about a time when you were fired and how you managed. Remain focused on her.


Ask your co-worker about her – “How are you doing? Are you alright?” Avoid sentences that start with I or my. For example, “Once when I got fired…” or “Once I used to work at Company Y…”

, Give your co-worker some time and space to come to terms with her firing before contacting her again. Try sending a short email – “Hi Jane. I’m really sorry that you left XYZ, Ltd. How are you doing? Please let me know if there is anything that I can do to help you.”Make sure to be understanding and not prying. Don’t go into the reasons for their firing unless they bring it up.

, Unless she/he specifically brings it up, do not discuss your co-worker's firing with your boss until the dust has settled. This is probably a stressful time for him/her as well, and he/she will likely be busy planning the transition period before someone else is hired to take over the position. It may be hard, but hold your tongue.

, Sometimes you can foresee a firing – a co-worker has a history of poor performance, bad relations with co-workers, or has had a falling out with the boss. At other times, it can be completely unexpected. In either case, resist the gossip that will likely be swirling. Stay quiet and focus on your work if you hear that a co-worker has been fired. Don’t speculate at the water-cooler and don’t try to pry from anyone, your former co-worker, your office mates, or you boss. Moreover, don’t believe rumors that you may overhear., Don’t horn in on your former co-worker’s responsibilities too soon. Even if she/he had easier tasks, a nicer office, or better parking spot, don't be tempted to ask for these soon after her/his termination. Let things settle down. Your boss will likely have a plan for you and the co-worker’s replacement, and could see your haste as in very poor taste.

, Be careful, particularly if you sense that your co-worker’s firing may be the start of a round of layoffs. Evaluate your work. Are you meeting expectations? Are you a valuable employee or an expendable one? Even if the termination was isolated, focus on the work in front of you. A firing can cause chaos and place added work on everyone who remains. Try to be even more attentive to your tasks and to the quality of your work. Your boss will appreciate your performance. It may even pay off in a promotion in the long run.

Be prepared to explain your decision.",How to Quit Your Job Without Giving Notice," There may be options available to you if you want to quit without giving notice because you have a personal or family crisis, or because you're the victim of workplace harassment.If you have a problem with your work environment, such as an abusive boss or coworker, make sure the person with whom you speak is not involved with or connected to the situation.
Explain your reasons for wanting to leave immediately, and see if any accommodations can be made.
For example, you may be allowed to work out a notice by working from home. However, if your work is not the type of thing you can do remotely, such as if you work on an assembly line, this may not be an option.
Make sure this meeting will be kept confidential. You don't want everyone knowing you're going to leave until you do so. Otherwise, there might be some backlash.;
, If you're unsure how to compose your letter, you may be able to find samples online that will help guide you. Avoid copying a sample verbatim, though. It might not fit your situation.Try to find more than one sample. Read them carefully so you understand the substance well enough to make it your own.
You typically don't necessarily want your letter to sound to formal or canned. However, if you're delivering the letter to an abusive or problematic boss, a canned letter may be appropriate.

, As tempting as it may be to fire off an ""I quit"" email, a traditional letter is a better way to go. Even though you're not giving any notice, it shows that you respect your employer.You typically can find a business letter template on any word processing application. Using that will make formatting your letter much easier.
If your employer has a dedicated human resources department, create two identical letters. One should be addressed to your boss, the other to the head of human resources.
Include your personal address on the letter, along with any additional non-company contact information such as your personal phone number or email address.

, Regardless of your real feelings about your boss or your job experience, courtesy makes a better impression. Being polite and professional will make it easier to accept your resignation.State the exact date on which you want your employment to end. Don't say ""effective immediately"" or ""effective at the end of this week.""
If you're writing the letter on September 14 and you expect your last day to be September 16, write ""I am writing to resign my position, effective September 16.""
Apologize for not being able to provide any notice, and close your letter by thanking your employer for the opportunity.

, Show your employer you respect their time. Don't go on a long, rambling rant about your personal issues or your problems with the company. Simply state that you're resigning your position, effective immediately, and leave it at that.Keep in mind that this letter could come back to haunt you, even if you already have another job lined up. You shouldn't put it past your boss to send a copy of the letter to your new employer – especially if you live and work in a relatively small town, or work in a close-knit industry.
If you're not comfortable disclosing the reason you need to resign, you don't have to say anything specific.
Remember that as an at-will employee, you can leave at any time for any reason at all, or for no reason.
Mention any issues regarding accrued time off or your last paycheck. Some employers require you to come in for an exit interview when you accept your final paycheck.
You should generally be open to follow any existing separation procedures, unless doing so would be impossible – for example, if you have to travel far away immediately.

, When you've finished your letter, double- and triple-check it for spelling and grammatical errors. You want your last impression to be a good one, and typos or sloppy grammar won't do you any favors.Keep in mind that some people view the presence of typos as a sign of disrespect. You're signaling that you don't think they're worth the effort to produce the best work.
After you've proofread your letter, print it off and sign it by hand. Make copies of your signed letters for your own records before you take them to your employer.

, If at all possible, you want to take the letter to your boss in person rather than mailing it. Mail does have the benefit of being able to later prove the letter was received. However, this benefit is outweighed by the difficulty of timing.When you speak with your boss, be as apologetic as possible. It can help to acknowledge that you understand how your leaving may put them in a bind.
If you have a legitimate reason, talk about the situation. They may be able to help you more than they would if you said nothing.
If you have any questions about your employer's separation procedures, now is the time to ask them.
Depending on your position, you may want to offer to help out in the coming weeks or be available by phone or email to answer questions.
Reach out to coworkers or direct supervisors you worked with closely, or with whom you had a strong rapport. You want to thank them personally and let them know you enjoyed working with them, so there are no hard feelings.

, Most established employers, especially larger corporations, will have a written employee handbook. However, you may not have been given your own copy.Even if you do have your own copy, it's likely you haven't looked at it since it was given to you when you first started your job.
If you don't have a copy, talk to someone in human resources about getting one. If you want to keep your plans a secret, you don't have to tell them why you need it. Just say you want to check the benefits policy.
You also may be able to get a hold of an employee handbook on the sly if you know of a coworker who has a copy. Just ask to see theirs.

, Your employee handbook should have a section dealing with what happens when an employee voluntarily separates from the company. These sections typically state that two weeks' notice is required.If the separation policy makes no mention of providing notice, then you have nothing to worry about. However, this is rarely the case.
Your employer typically will list consequences for quitting without sufficient notice. A typical consequence is that you cannot expect a positive recommendation from the employer after you're gone.
Often this means that future employers won't have the ability to verify any positive experience or education you've acquired as a result of the job.
Particularly if you're just starting in a career, this can be a pretty devastating consequence.

, Whether you get money in your final paycheck for accrued leave may be tied to whether you provided notice. If this is the case, you may want to reconsider whether quitting your job without giving notice is worth it.This may be particularly important if your employer allows you to accrue paid time off and you've been working there for awhile.
Keep in mind that in that case, this amount may add up to hundreds, if not thousands of dollars.
However, if the reason you must leave without notice involves some emergency, you may be able to make arrangements with your employer to get paid for at least part of this time.

, If you were issued any company property, such as a laptop or a mobile phone, bring them with you on your last day. Find out what the procedures are for checking them back in.Some employers require all company property to be returned at a scheduled exit interview. If your employer has this policy, get a list from human resources of the property that was checked out in your name so you can make sure everything is returned.
If you have a parking pass or badge for building security, your employer likely wants those back too.
Check your belongings thoroughly before you leave on your final day, and make sure you aren't inadvertently taking home company property such as office supplies or other materials.

, You don't generally need an attorney to quit your job without giving notice – there's no law against it. However, if you have unresolved issues with your employer, you may need legal advice.If you happened to be under an employment contract, you are not an at-will employee. It is imperative that you find an experienced employment attorney who can analyze our contract and the penalties for breaking it. Do this before you quit.
In some circumstances you may feel as though you were forced to quit. If your workplace was abusive or unsafe, an employment attorney can help you assess your legal options.
You also may need legal assistance if something happens after you quit. For example, your employer might seek reimbursement for expenses that were covered while you were an employee.
This is most likely to happen if your employer paid for continuing education courses or something similar that has a future benefit.

, If you're quitting your job without giving notice because you need to immediately start another job, your decision likely will have few if any negative consequences. However, it's generally good form to make sure your new employer is aware that you are quitting without notice.It's also important to keep in mind that if you quit without notice and without good cause, you probably will not be eligible for unemployment benefits.
If you have to quit your job without giving notice because of a family or personal emergency, this may not be possible.
However, to the extent possible, your best option is to seek other employment while you're still working. Once hired, let them know you're available to start immediately.
Some new jobs may not give you the time to work out a notice. If you fear the job offer will be rescinded if you have to work out a notice, you may have no choice.
In any event, making sure your new employer knows that you are quitting your old job without giving notice can spare an unfortunate surprise. If your former employer decides to share this information with your new employer, you won't have to worry about negative consequences.

, Getting a written reference letter from your immediate supervisor before your last day can cut through a lot of red tape. This letter can be especially valuable depending on your employer's notice policy.You also should keep in mind that someone's opinion might change. When you leave, you may create a vacuum that leaves your immediate supervisor and coworkers scrambling.
In light of increased stress and an expanded workload, they may not be as generous in describing your time working with them.
Keep in mind that providing a written reference is no guarantee that a new employer won't call your old job. However, it can lessen their motivation to do so.

, If you're filling out a standard application for a job, it likely will require information about how you left your job. Often you must specify whether you provided notice.As tempting as it may be, don't check the box indicating that you gave notice if you didn't.
A potential employer can easily find out this information by calling your own employer, and may do so even if you state that you prefer they aren't contacted.
Despite answering ""no"" when asked if a former employer can be contacted, a prospective employer still may call to verify that the information you provided was correct.
Aside from that, telling a prospective employer that they can't contact a former employer is typically a bad idea. It sends up red flags by signaling to the prospective employer that you left on bad terms.

, When you leave a job without notice, it may come up in future interviews. Employers often look at employees who quit without notice as people who didn't respect their employer.Particularly if you have another job lined up when you quit, leaving this employer without giving notice may not make any difference.
However, be aware that there are some managers who are sticklers about this sort of thing. They may have seemingly arbitrary rules such as never hiring someone who has quit a job without notice. This isn't something you can predict or control.
If you have a legitimate explanation for why you quit without giving notice, share it with prospective employers.
If your former employer understood and didn't fault you for leaving, sharing their response to your resignation will look even better.

In order to receive unemployment benefits, you must have earned a certain amount of money during your base period.


For example, in Texas, you must have earned at least 37 times your weekly benefit amount in order to qualify.;
, In addition to earning enough wages to qualify, you must have also terminated your employment for allowable reasons. In general, this means you must have lost your job through no fault of your own.


In Texas, acceptable reasons include:

Being laid off;
Having a reduction in hours not related to misconduct;
Being fired for reasons other than misconduct; or
quitting with good cause related to work., Even if you are initially eligible for unemployment benefits, you must meet ongoing requirements in order to remain eligible. In Texas, you must:


Meet work search requirements, which asks you to be actively looking for a job.
Request unemployment payments when necessary.
Be physically and mentally able to work.
Be available for full-time work.
Participate in reemployment activities when required.
Respond to government requests when required., You do not need to attend a hearing in order to apply for unemployment. Instead, you will want to request a hearing should you be denied benefits. If you were denied, then the agency should have told you the reasons why. The letter should also outline the appeal process.


If the letter is silent about your appeal rights, then contact the agency at the number provided on the letterhead. Ask how you can appeal the denial.

, When you receive a response from your state government, it may include a statement of wages and potential benefit amounts. In Texas, this form tells you the amount of wages your employer reported paying you during your base period; whether you have enough wages to qualify for benefits; and what type of benefits you qualify for.


This form is important to pay attention to as you want to make sure it accurately reflects your wages. If something on the form is wrong or missing, contact your state's unemployment agency to correct the problem., You will also receive multiple letters assessing your eligibility based on the requirements of your state. Each letter will assess your eligibility on a single issue. Each letter will contain a statement of the issue, the decision that was made, the reason for that decision, a legal citation, and information on what you can do to appeal the decision.


For example, assume you were fired for not showing up to work for six days. Assume your truck broke and once you got it fixed you returned to work.

To receive benefits, you will need to meet the wage requirements, job separation requirements, and ongoing eligibility requirements.
In this scenario, you will likely receive three determination letters stating that you are eligible based on past wages and for the transportation issue, but that you are not eligible based on the job separation requirement., You can be denied unemployment benefits for any reason that results in you not meeting any one of the eligibility requirements. Some of the most common reasons include voluntarily quitting, being fired for misconduct, or not earning enough during your base period.Make sure you understand why your benefits claim was denied so you can prepare a successful appeal.

, If you want to appeal the denial, then you should think about meeting with a lawyer. Your employer will probably be represented by a lawyer at the hearing.Accordingly, you might want to meet with a lawyer to help you come up with a solid argument.


You can find an attorney by visiting your state’s bar association. Most state bar associations run a referral service.
Realize that some states allow attorneys to provide “limited scope representation.” If you do not want to pay for a lawyer to handle the whole case, then you can contract with a lawyer to provide discrete tasks for a fixed fee. For example, the lawyer could help you prepare for your hearing or look over your forms. Not all states allow this kind of “unbundled” legal services, but many states do. You can ask a lawyer during a telephone consultation if he or she offers this service.
Also look into non-profit legal aid agencies. Legal aid provides free or reduced-cost legal services to people in financial need. To find a legal aid organization near you, visit the Legal Services Corporation’s website. You can search for legal aid by zip code on their home page.

, Every state will have a time limit on appealing a benefits denial. The time limit will be clearly stated on your determination notice so you need to be careful to read it as soon as you receive it.


In Texas, you have 14 days to appeal from the date the determination letter was sent. The date the letter was sent is on the top of the letter and the last day you can file an appeal is also stated in that letter., Your first appeal will begin with a written appeal form being filled out. Most states will have forms you can use some states even allow you to fill out an online form to start the process.


In Texas, your written appeal can be submitted online, in person, or by mailing or faxing your appeal letter. In general, your appeal letter should contain the following information:

Your name;
Your Social Security number;
Your current address;
The date you were mailed the determination letter;
A copy of the determination letter; and
Any dates you will not be able to attend a hearing.As you can see, the written portion of your first appeal is a simple notice to the state agency that you will be appealing. You do not need to argue anything or provide any evidence at this stage. You will do all of this during your hearing.

, When you send in your appeal letter, make sure you keep a copy for your own records. This will help you in case you need to refer back to the letter at a later date or if the state agency fails to receive your letter.

, If you failed to inform your state agency about hearing accommodations in your written appeal, you will need to inform them as soon as possible so you can be taken care of. In Texas, you should inform the state if you:


Need interpreters for yourself or your witnesses;
Have a hearing impairment; or
Need access to a telephone or fax machine., Six to eight weeks after you make your written appeal, you will receive a packet of information detailing your hearing. Usually your hearing will be five to ten days after you receive your packet. In Texas, this packet will include:


The date and time of the hearing;
Instructions on how to participate and submit documents;
Information the state received in response to your claim;
All statements the state received when investigating your appeal issues;
Any protests to your appeal; and
The issues up for discussion., You should have documents that support your assertion that you are entitled to unemployment insurance benefits. At a hearing, you will make a stronger case for yourself if you have supporting evidence. You may need:pay stubs
copies of your performance review or evaluation
reprimands or warnings
employee manuals.

, You can prepare by taking some time to think about what you want to say at the hearing. Think about what evidence supports your claim for unemployment benefits. Then arrange these points in a logical order.Practice with a friend. Take out your bullet points and run down through them, pretending that you are talking to a judge. Try to predict what questions you will be asked. Then practice giving answers.
You also should ask any witnesses to attend the hearing with you. They can testify on your behalf. If you are worried that a witness will not appear voluntarily, then ask the court clerk to issue a subpoena., On the day of your hearing, arrive early and dress professionally. If you have a telephone hearing, make sure your telephone is charged and working properly. Be sure you have all of your documents you want to submit and be sure your witnesses re ready to go. At this point you have gathered your evidence and you have prepared. Take part in the hearing and be confident in your preparations.

, After your hearing is over, a decision will be made regarding your appeal. This may take multiple weeks so be prepared to wait. You will usually obtain a letter in the mail informing you of the decision that has been made.


If you agree with the decision, follow the directions in your mailing in order to collect benefits and remain eligible.
If you disagree with the initial appeal, you may want to try subsequent appeals.

, If you do not agree with the outcome of your initial appeal, you may have the ability to make further appeals. In Texas, the first step is to appeal to the entire Workforce Commission. This appeal must be made within 14 days of your receipt of the first appeal decision and must be written.


Your second written appeal should include all of your personal information, the date of your first appeal decision letter, our appeal number from your first appeal, and a description of the reasons you disagree with the initial decision.
You can submit this appeal online, in person, or through the mail or fax., After you receive your second appeal decision, if you still do not agree, you can file a motion for a rehearing. In Texas, you must do this within 14 days of the date the state mailed you the Commission decision.


The Workforce Commission will only grant a rehearing if you can show all of the following:

Important new information about your case;
A compelling reason for not submitting this information during the first Commission appeal; and
Why you think this information should change the outcome of your case., Only after you have exhausted all other appeal opportunities discussed can you appeal your decision to a court (except for the motion for a rehearing, which is optional). In Texas, you must appeal to a civil court between 15 and 28 days after the Commission mailed you their decision. The instructions for submitting an appeal in court will be included with the Commission's decision."

Self-employed individuals do not often qualify for unemployment upon losing their source of income, but you should check with your state in order to verify that no unemployment aid is available.;
, You should file in the state that you were originally employed in.


Note that moving to or living in another state may not completely disqualify you from receiving unemployment benefits. If you worked in multiple states or currently live in a state other than the one you were employed in, contact the Unemployment Agency in the state you currently live in for more information. That agency should direct you on how to file claims with other states.

, A ""base period"" refers to a state-established period of time you must be employed during before receiving benefits.


In most states, the base period refers to the first four out of the last five calendar quarters prior to the time of your unemployment claim.Note that unemployment benefits are usually determined by the amount of earnings made during the base period. Weekly benefit amounts may be figured by the calendar quarter in which you earned the most.

, The reason for your job loss greatly impacts whether or not you qualify. Under most circumstances, if you quit your job or were fired for just reasons, you will not qualify.

, At any point in time, you might be required to report to a local Unemployment Insurance Claims Office or Employment Service Office.


If you do not report to the office when scheduled for an interview, you might lose your benefits.

, If you have exhausted regular state unemployment insurance, you might qualify for extended benefits.


Note that you must have had an initial unemployment application in effect as early as May 5, 2007, if not later.
You must also have used all regular state unemployment benefits and have no rights to regular or extended benefits under any other state unemployment compensation laws.
The Extended Benefits program provides an additional 13 weeks of benefits during periods of high unemployment within your state. Some states also have an additional 7 weeks of extended benefits, for a grand total of 20 additional weeks., Special unemployment compensation is available for qualifying ex-servicemembers.You must have been on active duty within a branch of the U.S. military.

,


These benefits are usually available to both unemployed and self-employed workers whose employment has been lost or interrupted as a direct result of a major disaster.
You must not be eligible to qualify for regular unemployment benefits if applying for this program.
You may qualify if the disaster has caused you to lose your job or place to work, has prevented you from reaching your place of work, or has injured you in a way that prevents you from working. You might also qualify if your workplace has been damaged or if you become the head of a household because the former head of household died during the disaster.

If you have a partner, he or she must work less than 24 hours a week on average. Combined, you and your partner must have less than £16,000 in savings.
In order to continue qualifying for benefits, you will need to report to a Job center Plus every two weeks to indicate how your job search is going.

You can find a link to the appropriate office in each state at http://workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/agencies.asp. Common ways employers commit fraud include:Paying workers “under the table”
Improperly classifying employees as independent contractors
Improperly shifting employee records among various business entities;
, Employers also allowed to hire independent contractors or have shared employees. Frequently, you can alleviate concerns simply by asking the person you believe may be committing fraud. They may be reporting accurately, but you don’t see that part of their activities.

, Even though the person verifies that they are not committing fraud, you may consider reporting anyway if you reasonably believe their response was not truthful. Some things that would be reasonable would be: Observing the work environment and seeing an employer treating an independent contractor as an employee
Observing the work environment and seeing fewer actual business entities than are issuing paychecks

, Perceptions can be different from one person to the next, so before making a report based on something you were told, check it out for yourself. If someone comes to you with concerns of unemployment fraud by another person, give them the information to report it on their own.

, Again, each state sets their own rules for maintaining unemployment insurance. You can find a link to the appropriate office in each state at http://workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/agencies.asp. Common requirements for employees include:Former employees must actively search for work while drawing unemployment
Former employees may work under some circumstances, but their earnings and hours must be reported to the appropriate office

, Common ways a former employer commits fraud include:


Earning money from employment that is not reported to the appropriate authorities
Knowingly submitting inaccurate job search documents
Knowingly submitting an inaccurate application for benefits

, People are allowed to work while drawing unemployment compensation. Frequently, you can alleviate concerns simply by asking the person you believe may be committing fraud. They may be reporting accurately, but you don’t see that part of their activities.

, Even though the person verifies that they are not committing fraud, you may consider reporting anyway if you reasonably believe their response was not truthful. Some things that would be reasonable would be: Observing a person submit a weekly claim and denying working when you also observed him or her working during that period
Observing a person submit a weekly claim stating they looked for work, but knowing they did not. Be aware, however, that internet job searches usually qualify as looking for work.
Observing a person submit a weekly claim stating they were available for work, but knowing they were on vacation out of the area that week.

, Perceptions can be different from one person to the next, so before making a report based on something you were told, check it out for yourself. If someone comes to you with concerns of unemployment fraud by another person, give them the information to report it on their own.

, Knowingly making a false report is a crime in many states. If you have a reasonable belief that unemployment fraud is being committed, you should report it. If it turns out to not be fraud, there should be no repercussions. If, on the other hand, you are angry at someone or don’t like them, and you make a report of unemployment fraud without having any reasonable belief that fraud is actually being committed, you can be criminally prosecuted in some states., The US Department of Labor publishes a directory of contact information and/or websites for reporting fraud. This is broken down by reporting fraud by employers or fraud by employees. You can access it at http://www.dol.gov/dol/maps/fraud.htm. Most states will give an option of phoning or faxing in the report or making the report online.

Quitting your job can be a difficult decision, and you will need to carefully weigh all the pros and cons in order to choose the right option for you.


Compare the cost of child care to your income to help you decide whether working full-time is the best option for you.
Make sure to have a plan for health insurance before you give your notice. Depending on your situation, you may choose to get coverage through your spouse's plan, to enroll in COBRA, or to purchase an individual insurance plan through the insurance marketplace.;
, Depending on the nature of the company you work for and your reasons for wanting to quit your job during maternity leave, you may have other options available to you.


If, for example, you cannot afford to send your child to daycare while you are at work, you may consider asking your company about the possibility of working from home, either as a regular employee or as a freelancer.
You may likewise be able to negotiate for part-time hours if you want to spend more time with your child, but don't want to cut ties with your company.
If you love the company you work for and would like to return when your child is older, it is especially important to try to keep your foot in the door, or at least to leave on exceptionally good terms.

, It is very common for new mothers to change their minds about their employment status during maternity leave. If you are not 100% sure that you want to leave your job, consider going back to work for several weeks or months to see how it works for you. If you come to the conclusion after returning to work that it doesn't work you, you can give your notice at that time.


If you are feeling unsure about whether or not you will want to return to work after your maternity leave, but you want to make sure that you don't leave your job on bad terms, you may wish to have a candid discussion with your boss before your maternity leave begins, and let him know that there is a possibility that you may choose not to return. Think about your company culture and how likely it is that you will be laid off after this conversation before you decide to go through with it., Your company may have specific procedures to follow in the event that you do not come back from your maternity leave.


Some companies may require you to pay them back for any benefits you used while on maternity leave, including short-term disability benefits and health insurance, if you resign while on maternity leave. Make sure you understand if and for how long you will need to return to work in order to retain these benefits., This will vary depending on what kind of maternity leave benefits your company provides, whether you have health insurance through your employer, and what other sources of income your family has.You should also consider the fact that an employer can lay you off immediately after you have given your notice. If you cannot afford to lose your salary and/or benefits before your child arrives, and you think there is a possibility that your employer will lay you off, it may be best for you to wait until you are on maternity leave to give your notice.

, If you know that you will not be returning to work after maternity leave, waiting until the end of your maternity leave to give your notice may in some cases give you access to more benefits from your employer, but it may also leave your company short-handed. The right decision for you will depend on your personal situation and the kind of company you work for.


If your company offers additional maternity benefits beyond those provided by FMLA and short-term disability, consider that quitting during maternity leave may harm the company financially. Some people even believe that taking advantage of generous maternity benefits when you know ahead of time that you have no intention of returning to work may result in the company's deciding not to offer these benefits to other new parents in the future.Be prepared for the possibility that your boss and/or coworkers might think you have been taking advantage of benefits, even if you genuinely believed that you would be returning to work when you left on maternity leave.

, If you decide to give your notice while on maternity leave, you should still give as much notice as you would give under normal circumstances. For example, if the expected amount of notice is two weeks at your place of employment, try to give notice of your decision to quit at least two weeks before you are due to return., If you're struggling with the decision, give yourself some time to think about it, but tell yourself that you have to come to a decision by a specific date. This will help you focus on making the decision and prevent you from waiting until the very last moment to give your notice.

, It's always a good idea to leave your job on the best possible terms because you never know what will happen in the future. You may one day decide to return to the company, or you may need a reference letter from your boss if you decide to looking for other employment opportunities.Offer to help the company deal with the transition by doing some work from home or coming in for a few hours to help train your replacement.
Write an outline of your job responsibilities, and be sure to include important information, such as passwords and contact information, that your replacement will need to know.
Be polite and refrain from expressing any negative opinions about the company, your boss, or your coworkers.

, If you received healthcare benefits at work, you will have the option to enroll in COBRA. You will also need to rollover or cash out any retirement savings.


Fill out all necessary paperwork and direct questions to your human resources or personnel department.
Pay attention to deadlines and costs associated with COBRA enrollment and retirement changes.

, Write a formal letter of resignation and deliver it to your supervisor and the human resources department.


You may wish to consider giving your notice to your boss in person or over the phone before you write your formal resignation letter, especially if the two of you have a good relationship. This is much more personal and may help ease hard feelings., You may have taken files or other hard copy or electronic materials with you after your maternity leave began. Be sure to get those things back to your supervisor.


Return any keys or identification badges as well.

, If you left anything behind, such as pictures, coffee cups, sweaters, or other items, stop at your office to get them.


If you are unable to return to the office, arrange to have your belongings delivered to you. Some companies have security policies in place that will not allow former employees to return to the office.

, If you're accustomed to getting up and going to the office every day, staying home with your child could be a big adjustment. Ease the transition by coming up with a regular (weekly or daily) routine of things you need to do, so you feel like your days still have structure.Avoid watching too much television. Look for productive things you can do around the house or fun things to do with your child instead.

, It's totally normal to feel isolated as a new stay-at-home mom, but don't let those feelings consume you!Keep in touch with old friends, and try to meet other stay-at-home moms.
Take part in a club or group activity. If you need childcare, try joining a gym that offers it on-site.

, If you plan on going back to work eventually, be sure to keep the doors open for an easier back-to-work transition.Stay in touch with former colleagues and anyone else who may be able to help you find a job in your field in the future.
Keep up-to-date with what's happening in your field by reading industry news, watching webinars, or taking classes.
If you're concerned about how an extended absence from the workforce will look on your resume, look for part-time or freelance opportunities that won't require much of a commitment. Even volunteering a few hours a week or writing an industry-related blog can help keep you connected to your career.

, Lots of moms decide that staying home is not for them and decide to go back to work after a few months or a few years. Do whatever you feel is best for you and your child.

You need to know that quitting your current job is a prudent move by looking into other available positions. Do an internet search or look through the local want ads to determine if there is a demand for someone with your particular abilities and skill set.Try looking at job websites like Monster.com, Indeed.com, or Simplyhired.com to see what sorts of alternative employment you can find. These sites offer a wide variety of jobs that are searchable by job type, pay grade, and state, city or region.Be sure to account for current living arrangements. If you are unable to move to a different area of the country, your job opportunities may be much more limited than someone who can pick up and move at any time.Be sure that you consider bonuses, insurance packages and other supplemental benefits when comparing your current position to potential employment opportunities.;
, Try applying to a few jobs that you feel might be a good fit for you. You will need to gauge how marketable or desirable you are to potential employers in order to leverage the best contract you can from the available job pool.Be sure to update your resume, including any and all accomplishments from your current job.
It is also wise to put together a template for a cover letter. Cover letters will have to change slightly for different positions or job postings. It can be helpful to highlight the areas that will be subject to change on your template.

, If there are other people who rely on you, or other people who have a vested interest in your income (wives, husbands, children, etc.), you need to discuss the possibility of quitting your current job and taking up a new position with them.This is a particularly important step if you are planning to move to a new location for a new job.
You may also wish to speak with someone who has experience changing jobs or careers to get some further insight on the process. A parent or older colleague whom you trust could be a good choice.Make sure you keep any and all plans for leaving your current job among people you trust. It is not wise to discuss your future job plans with co-workers until after you have informed your current employer about ending your tenure with the company. , Leaving your old job for your new one may not be “free”. Many people incur costs as a result of switching jobs. First, you may be left without an income for a short period of time. Secondly, you may need to purchase a new wardrobe or, if necessary for your job, equipment or tools. You will need to plan for issues like this in advance.If you plan on being unemployed between your two jobs, make sure you have enough money in your savings account to cover this period of unemployment.If you live paycheck to paycheck, you may need to secure a loan to get you through a period of temporary unemployment., If you plan on going into business for yourself, build a foundation for that business while you are still employed and earning a regular paycheck. If you are moving to another place of employment, make sure you have a solid offer in hand before turning in a resignation letter to your current employer.Never leave your current position based on a theoretical or verbal offer. You never know what can happen and you don’t want to be left jobless.
Be clear with potential employers about your current position and responsibilities. You will want to leave enough time between quitting your old job and starting your new one to tie up any loose ends with your old position. Future employers should appreciate that you are considerate enough to make sure you leave your old job on good terms.

, The first person at your workplace to find out about your plans to leave should be your boss, manager, or supervisor. This individual is in the best position to fill your position and will need to know you are leaving as soon as possible so that he can make other plans. Also, this is presumably the person who hired you (or at least didn’t fire you) and signed your paychecks. Letting him know first is simply a common courtesy.
Most jobs require you to give them two weeks notice before quitting your position, although some companies prefer that you give them thirty days notice.

, Check with your employer to see if a change of status, such as a significant pay raise, increased benefits, bonuses, or other perks are in your future at your present job. Quitting before these events occur may effectively cost you money. However, your boss may be so desperate to keep you that he will offer these perks to you immediately when you inform him you are quitting.


Don’t change your plans for empty promises. If your current employer has offered promises of a raise or a bonus before, but failed to follow through on them, then there is no reason to think this situation will be different. Any and all offers made by your present employer in an attempt to keep you on should be put into writing. This will help you hold him to it.

, Your boss may express any one of a number of emotions when you tell him you are leaving. Some bosses take employees quitting personally and become visibly angry when it happens. It is important that you stand your ground and commit to quitting while still showing the proper level of respect and courtesy, even if your boss gets mad.Remember, your boss is still your boss, at least for the next few weeks. Don’t take your quitting as an opportunity to turn the tables on him and chew him out, belittle him, call him an idiot, etc. None of these things are “graceful” and you will be burning a bridge with someone from whom you might still need a letter of recommendation or reference., Communicate your plans with your fellow employees so they can be prepared to take up the slack when you leave. Depending on the type of work you are doing, up to thirty days notice may make their efforts to replace you easier.Make sure you tell your closest colleagues or work friends first, so they don’t hear it from someone else and feel slighted.You are not obligated to inform everyone in the workplace that you are quitting. However, it is a courtesy that needs to be extended to the people who will need to pick up your slack once you are gone., You will want to inform the human resources department at your current employer about your plans to change jobs or quit. They will likely need to make some adjustments to your files and prepare for a new employee to fill your position, so they could use a head’s up.Be sure your correct mailing address is on file, so your tax information can be sent to you next year.

, It is critical that you don’t “slack off” or neglect your work while you are finishing up your tenure with a company. Also, don’t continuously talk about how much better your new job will be or talk to co-workers about how happy you are to be leaving your current position.Everybody else is staying in their position. Constantly talking about getting out of a company only makes you seem like a jerk to everyone who is staying.
Your work performance in the last two weeks of your job are as important as the first two weeks. Don’t forget, you are being constantly evaluated and a decrease in performance near the end of your term with the company may be reflected in reference letters down the line.Be polite and respectful to all your coworkers and supervisors during the period before you quit., If you are dealing with issues or customers that will require further attention, either complete these tasks yourself or make sure someone else will do it when you are gone., Leave your desk and files in perfect order. Don’t assume your replacement will understand your methods of file storage and organization. Label everything clearly so it is easy to find once you are gone.Don't hide important documents in a childish attempt at revenge.
Don’t take or steal anything that the company provided you, like staplers, computers, etc.

, Make duplicate copies of all records and contact information related to your position so the person who replaces you will be able to adjust to their situation more easily.It is also important that you organize everything you were working on in an easily searchable way. It can also be helpful to draw up an inventory of your files and work materials for your replacement.
It is often beneficial to have a “handing over notes” meeting between you and your replacement. Some companies require this, while others do not. This meeting will allow you to explain your job, duties, associated files, etc. to your replacement face-to-face.While it is rarely required, it would be a nice gesture to leave your contact information for your replacement so that he can contact you if he has questions, comments or concerns about the position., Look into your employer furnished insurance and retirement plans. You will want to make sure these benefits are not lost upon termination of your employment.You will want to be sure your 401K can be rolled over to your new job.

, Talk to your employer about any resume information or references they would be willing to share about you to prospective employers. This is why it is important to end your tenure with your current company on a high note.You need to get this reference now, even if you have other employment lined up. Once you are gone, your accomplishments and years of service will be quickly forgotten.

, Most jobs these days have exit interviews designed to identify your impressions of the company, its operations, your position and the management. Be honest and open when conducting this interview. Your answers to their questions can help the business improve.In order to quit “graciously”, don’t use this exit interview to air grievances or hurl personal attacks at coworkers or employees you don’t like. Stick to discussing areas that you think the company could use improvement in or highlight the areas in which you feel the company excels.

Don't tell your boss you're filing for bankruptcy.,
Watch who you tell at work.,
Talk to your attorney from home.,
Know when to give your employer advance notice.",How to Protect Your Job when Filing for Bankruptcy1," Particularly if you're filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, there's little to no chance your employer will even find out that you're filing for bankruptcy – unless you tell them.This means that if you have to take any time off from work to handle your bankruptcy, for example to meet with your attorney or attend a hearing, you'll have to come up with some other reason to excuse your absence.
You don't have to lie, but you can be vague. If pressed for details, you can simply state that it's personal, not work-related, and that you'd rather not go into it.
If your boss insists on a specific reason, you'll have to decide what to do. Use your best judgement to determine whether disclosing your bankruptcy to your boss is the right thing for you to do.;
, You may feel close to some of your coworkers, and it's natural to want to talk to them about important things that are going on in your life. However, proceed with caution when it comes to your bankruptcy if you're concerned they might tell higher-ups about it.It can be difficult to avoid talking about your bankruptcy, particularly if you have close friends at work who you normally spend time with outside the workplace.
Keep in mind that if your boss is to know, it's better to hear about it from you than from someone else, because that way you can control the information your boss receives.
If someone else talks about it, on the other hand, they may make it sound like a bigger deal than it is.

, The workplace isn't the best place to have a phone conversation with your attorney anyway, because of the risk that others could overhear. This is particularly true if you're trying to keep your bankruptcy secret from your employer.Overhearing half a conversation is a recipe for disaster if the person who happens to overhear is also someone who loves to gossip.
Waiting until after work to talk to your attorney also enables you to have undivided attention on the conversation, which can be crucial to understanding your bankruptcy case.
Another option if you need to reach your attorney during the workday is to send an email. Make sure you use a private email account on your own device, though, not a work computer or a work email that might be monitored.

, If you're filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, there's a good chance your employer is going to find out about your case eventually. If payments on your reorganization plan are taken out of your check, your employer will get a notice to adjust the payroll.In that situation, it's generally better for you to tell your employer first, so they hear it from you rather than from the court.
Getting an unexpected notice can serve as an invitation for your employer to think the worst, especially if your employer gets the impression that you haven't mentioned it out of fear or shame.
Not all districts require these orders, however. Find out if one will be entered in your case before you talk to your employer about it.

"

Keep detailed records of your job performance.,
Talk to trusted former coworkers.,
Consult an experienced attorney.,
Notify the bankruptcy court.,
File your complaint.,
Participate in discovery.,
Attempt mediation.",How to Protect Your Job when Filing for Bankruptcy2," If you suspect your employer might fire you because you've filed for bankruptcy, you have an uphill battle – particularly if at-will employment laws apply to your position.Start saving copies of any performance reviews or positive comments you get, including emails or notes from supervisors or managers.
You also might keep a log and make entries each day to record positive experiences or statements from supervisors or coworkers.
Essentially, what you're doing is creating a record that will demonstrate that your employer had no reason to fire you except the fact that you filed for bankruptcy.
Protection from discrimination extends to other actions by your employer as well, even if those actions fall short of termination. For example, if you were due a raise or were in line for a promotion, your employer can't deny those just because you filed for bankruptcy.
There is an exception to this if you happen to work in the financial industry. Banks, investment firms, or other financial institutions can take your bankruptcy into account when considering you for a raise or a promotion.

, If your employer does fire you, talking about it with coworkers can confirm your suspicions that your termination was bankruptcy-related. In the event you decide to sue your employer, a few witnesses can strengthen your case.To go along with your strong performance record, you're going to need some indication that your employer terminated you because you filed for bankruptcy. This isn't typically something that your boss is going to say to your face.
However, comments may have been made to someone else, or a coworker may have seen emails or other correspondence that discussed the issue.
Take care not to rely on mere rumor. Try to get directly to the source – the person to whom the statements were made, rather than someone who heard about it from someone else.
Take detailed notes of coworker statements that you think might be helpful in a lawsuit, and ask if they would be willing to testify on your behalf. If they are, take down their name and phone number for future reference.

, Wrongful termination lawsuits are extremely complex and difficult to prove. Find an experienced employment law attorney and lay out your case for them so you can decide if you want to sue.Not only will you be filing your case in federal court (which has complex rules that can be difficult for a layperson to understand or intuit), but proving bankruptcy discrimination is incredibly difficult.
An experienced employment attorney will understand the types of proof you need and where you can possibly get them.
If your bankruptcy case is still pending and you've already hired a bankruptcy attorney, ask them for a recommendation.
Your wrongful termination case may intersect with your bankruptcy case, so it will be helpful if you have two attorneys who know and respect each other.
Employment law attorneys typically offer a free initial consultation, so it shouldn't cost you anything to at least talk to someone. Given your current financial situation, they should be willing to work with you on fees and may take your case on contingency.

, Particularly if your bankruptcy is still pending, you must notify the bankruptcy court if you intend to sue your former employer for wrongful termination. Any recovery you get typically will be factored into your assets for the purposes of your bankruptcy.If you fail to notify the court of your claim – even if it's only at this stage a potential claim – against your employer, you run the risk that your bankruptcy case could be dismissed.
This rule applies even if you haven't technically decided whether you're going to file suit or not, so it needs to be taken care of as quickly as possible.
Talk to your bankruptcy attorney (if you've hired one) about your plans to sue your former employer for wrongful termination, and see what they say. They should be able to take care of this obligation for you.

, If you've decided to file suit, your attorney will work with you to draft a complaint suing your employer for wrongful termination. Since your case is based in federal law, it must be filed in the federal district court with jurisdiction over your employer.Your complaint will identify you and your former employer, and set forth factual allegations that, if proven, would constitute discrimination against you on the basis of the fact that you filed for bankruptcy, in violation of federal law.
Your attorney will work with you to decide the damages for which you should ask the court.
When your lawsuit is filed, you'll be responsible for paying a $400 filing fee. Your attorney may pay this and add it to your bill, or help you apply to have the fee waived.
Once you've filed your lawsuit, you must have it served on your former employer. This typically means you'll have a U.S. marshal hand-deliver the complaint to your former employer (or their attorney or representative).
After service, your employer has a brief period of time to respond. Expect them to deny your allegations and potentially file a motion to dismiss.

, After the pleadings have all been filed and you've overcome any motion to dismiss filed by your former employer, the discovery process will begin. Through this process, you and your employer will exchange documents and information relevant to your case.One method of discovery which may be particularly helpful in proving your former employer's motivations in terminating you is requests for production.
You can ask for copies of your former employer's communications regarding your termination, your personnel file, and any other related policy documents.
Your attorney also will likely want to depose the person or people responsible for your termination. A deposition is a live interview under oath that is recorded by a court reporter, who produces a written transcript.
Your former employer's attorney likely will want to depose you as well. Your attorney will help prepare you for your deposition.

, Many federal courts require litigants to attempt mediation before they can proceed to trial. Even if it isn't required in your case, mediation may enable a quicker and simpler resolution to your claim.In mediation, a neutral third party facilitates negotiations between you and your former employer that hopefully lead to a mutually agreeable settlement.
The outcome of mediation is completely voluntary. That is, no agreement is forced on you. If you and your former employer cannot come to agreement, no agreement will be made and your case will proceed to trial.
On the other hand, if you and your former employer are able to reach a mutually agreeable resolution, the terms will be set forth in a written agreement.
Once you both sign the written settlement agreement, its terms will be legally binding on both parties. Make sure you read it carefully and understand everything in it before you sign.

Understand how the law protects you.,
Find out if the employer runs credit checks on applicants.,
Be up front about your bankruptcy.,
Provide positive references.",How to Protect Your Job when Filing for Bankruptcy3," Federal law prohibits government employers from discriminating against applicants because they filed for bankruptcy. However, this law doesn't apply to private employers.If you're working for the government, filing for bankruptcy can even work in your favor – particularly if you're applying for a job that requires you to get a security clearance.
People with high debt are viewed as a security risk because they are susceptible to bribery. Since you've filed for bankruptcy, you don't have that issue.
When working in the private sector, however, it's important to remember that you don't have this protection.
For this reason, you should tread lightly when it comes to bankruptcy, and only mention it if for some reason the employer would find out from a third party.

, Typically a potential employer isn't going to know that you filed for bankruptcy – particularly if you filed Chapter 7 and your case is closed – unless they run a credit check.For some jobs, your financial background is only tangentially related (at best) to the job you'll be performing. For these, if the employer is running a credit check, you may be better off looking elsewhere.
For example, if you're applying to be a cashier at a grocery store, there's really no reason they should insist on doing a credit check before they hire you. You might be better off applying at another store rather than having to deal with it.
Some jobs – such as many in the financial sector – are going to be difficult for you to get, if not completely closed off.
This is because when you're charged with handling other people's money, the fact that you've filed for bankruptcy is seen as a sign that you don't know how to be financially responsible.

, If the employer is going to run a credit check, it's best to tell them about your bankruptcy before they find out about it themselves. This gives you the opportunity to put a positive spin on the choice you made.The best time to tell the interviewer typically is not when they ask you to sign the form authorizing a credit check, but that may be the most opportune time.
Ideally, you want to bring it up at the first possible opportunity during your interview, to show that you're not ashamed of it and not shying away from it.
For example, if the interviewer asks you to describe a situation in which you overcame a challenge, you could mention your bankruptcy. Focus on the present and future, and talk about how you're grateful for the second chance and you're learning to be more responsible with your money.

, Particularly in some jobs, such as those in which you're handling money or managing money for others, having a bankruptcy can be a serious black mark on your record. Counteract that negative influence with strong personal references that can speak to your responsibility and strengths as an employee.You want people who can speak to your work ethic and sense of responsibility in the workplace, but you also want people who can testify to your strength of character.
Ideally, list people as references who are aware of your bankruptcy. They may be able to use it to describe how you are proactive in addressing and solving issues before they become more serious problems.

Remain professional.,
Find out why you are being terminated.,
Understand the seriousness of grief.,
Clarify your severance pay.,
Clarify the availability of insurance benefits.,
Review the details of the agreement.,
Be prepared for termination.,
Consider the offer.,
Negotiate the agreement.,
Determine your ability to negotiate.,
Keep your situation in mind.,
Speak up.,
Know which phrases may help you in the negotiation process.",How to Negotiate a Severance Package," Whether you are informed days, weeks, or months before you are let go from your job, or if you are completely unaware until the day you are actually terminated, it is important that you remain professional. Remaining professional can help ensure you can use your employer as a reference in the future.If you have a formal exit interview, you may have the opportunity to politely voice grievances.
If you remain in the same career field, you could end up working with or even being interviewed by former co-workers. If you fail to remain professional upon termination, you may leave a bad impression with former co-workers, damaging your reputation or even disqualifying yourself from future job opportunities.;
, Whether you are given a lot of notice prior to your termination or it happens suddenly, this could be a great opportunity to find out how you can be a better employee. The meeting that occurs upon your termination should include some justification of why you are being let go. Pay attention to this to find ways to improve in future jobs.If you are being laid off and are not given reasoning beyond that, you might ask why you were chosen over those who are not being laid off and/or ask for some feedback about your job performance in spite of the cutbacks.

, Grief should be regarded as a kind of injury that requires time to heal just like a physical injury. Although grief is typically associated with the loss of a loved one, for instance, the loss of a job can be just as difficult or more so. Whether you are aware of your impending termination for a period of time before it happens or taken by surprise, you will likely experience some grief from the loss of your job.Deal with your grief effectively by joining a support group, admitting the loss of your job and your emotions to others, and keeping a positive attitude and sense of humor.

, Every severance package is different, but almost all contain some kind of severance pay. Some severance packages may pay a terminated employee a lump sum, for instance, whereas others may pay out a sum over time in several payments. Make sure you understand how your severance pay will be distributed to you.Find out if your severance pay includes any unused paid time off, such as paid vacation or sick days or holidays—some severances may take these into consideration, and if not, it can't hurt to ask.
Find out whether the agreement asks you to waive any claim for unemployment compensation benefits.

, When you are terminated from a job and offered a severance package, there may be insurance benefits available to you in addition to any severance pay. Insurance benefits received as part of a severance package may include group life insurance, health insurance, dental insurance, or vision insurance.These items may not be included in a severance package (although they sometimes are), but again, it can't hurt to ask.


If no insurance benefits are offered to you as part of your severance package, at the very least you may continue your coverage for up to 18 months at your own expense through the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA), provided the company from which you are being let go has at least 20 employees.Insurance under COBRA is priced at the full cost the employer paid, to be paid by former employee. This can be very expensive.
If you decide not to continue your employer-based coverage through COBRA, you can enroll in a plan through the federal Marketplace via a special enrollment period., Your severance agreement may contain other details that you need to be aware of, such as what information you can or cannot share with another employer. These kinds of details may be the difference between whether you want to agree to the terms of the severance package or not. Review the agreement in as much detail as you can before accepting to make sure you are comfortable with the terms.It might be worth seeking the advice of an employment lawyer to help you review the details of the agreement., Because you may be taken aback by your termination—even if you think it may be coming—it is a good idea to have a plan for negotiating your severance in advance. This will help you execute the smart decisions that need to be made during a time when you may be a little distracted by your emotions.If you do not already have a lawyer, find one that can help you with negotiating your severance. An employment lawyer, in particular, would be helpful. This way you know exactly who to call upon your termination.
An employment lawyer can also help keep you on track emotionally by guiding you through the severance package and advising you on negotiation.

, Taking time to consider the offer is important because there are some aspects of the agreement that may affect you in significant ways. For one thing, the agreement you are required to sign may include a non-compete clause, which may bar you from employment in the same field for a certain period of time or prohibit you from bringing clients to a new company where you may work.In many states, non-compete clauses have been rendered impotent and impossible to enforce. Check with your attorney.
Another part of your agreement that may be important to carefully consider is any part that may limit your ability to sue the employer for discrimination, etc. If you feel you may have a case for this kind of legal action, you will want to be aware of any such clause in the agreement.
Workers over 40 have 21 days to consider a severance agreement as part of the federal age discrimination law.Be sure to compare your agreement with your employee handbook to be sure there are no discrepancies. If there are, bring them to the attention of an employment lawyer, or at least the employer.

, It is important that you at least try to negotiate the agreement. An employment lawyer may be able to help. Many employers may feel terrible that they have to let an employee go, and this may work in your favor in terms of negotiating a better agreement for yourself. Taking the initiative to at least try and get a better deal is important. Here are some things you might ask for:


More money. If you are being paid a lump sum, try doubling it. If you are being paid a monthly salary for a period of several months after your termination, try doubling the number of months. This could include bonuses you were expecting or unused paid time off.
Retention of equipment. You might ask to keep (or buy at a grossly reduced price) any equipment your employer has given you while you have been an employee, including computers, cell phones, etc.
Use of spaces. You might be able to get your employer to allow you to use office space in order to find new employment, which can be helpful if you need to make copies of your resume, etc.
Outplacement services. Some employers might be willing to pay for outplacement services, which can help you find a new job faster.
Insurance benefits. You may be able to get insurance benefits paid for as part of your negotiation.
Recommendation. You may be able to get your employer to agree to write you a recommendation as part of a severance agreement, which could help you secure a new job.

, If the company is experiencing financial difficulty, you may not be able to ask for more than what is being offered, but you may be able to trade one thing for something else you think you may need. For instance, perhaps you can trade some severance pay for insurance benefits.If the company is not experiencing financial difficulty, you may not have to trade—or even offer to trade—any part of the agreement for additional severance pay or benefits, etc.

, When you are let go from a job, the company is likely doing so for its own benefit, but there are consequences.Consider what not having a job may mean for you. If you have children or an ongoing medical problem that is expensive to treat, for instance, you may want to bring these things up in the negotiation.

, The negotiation may work in your favor if you are the first one to suggest an alternative to the offer on the table.For this reason, it may be wise to politely offer an alternative to the agreement as put forth by the employer that is above what you hope to get, and then let the negotiation work its way to what you are hoping to get.


For instance, if you are offered six months pay but you want nine months pay, you might politely ask for 12 months of pay and let them counter. They may counter with nine months, and then you'll get what you are hoping for.
Keep in mind that some employers will not be interested in negotiating, so be polite and do not get defensive, lest you end up with less than the original offer or nothing at all.

, Certain phrases can be useful in keep negotiations friendly but productive. For instance, you might say ""what kind of flexibility do we have here?"" regarding the agreement.

The drawback here is that in some negotiations the answer might simply be ""none."""
"
Take some time for yourself immediately after being fired or laid off.,
On your first full day of unemployment, work out the logistics of your life in the short term.,
On your second full day of unemployment, begin your new job search with earnest!,
Set up a schedule.,
Set a schedule for yourself that encompasses health.",How to Manage Time Effectively While Unemployed," The news can be shocking and a lot to take in at once, so first give yourself at least a few hours to process your new reality. Then spend the rest of the day doing your best to relax, unwind, and look after yourself both physically and emotionally.
, By this point, you will hopefully have somewhat of a clearer mind and better picture of what to start doing going forward. Some tasks you can take care of today include the following:


Applying for unemployment benefits (if eligible)
Reevaluating your budget and finances while there is no steady income
Thoroughly polishing your professional resume/CV

,

Scour online job boards like Indeed, CareerBuilder, Monster.com, etc. for leads you can filter by a variety of preferences.
Try old-school job searching methods like browsing the Help Wanted section of your local newspaper, or even take the initiative of researching companies you might want to work for, and find out if they are hiring.
Reach out to your network. Many jobs come from people knowing people, especially in your field. This is a good time to call, text, e-mail, or schedule face time with people who may be able to guide you.
Find resources for job hunters. If your area offers career counselors, this may be an excellent time to get help. Places such as unemployment offices, schools (and possibly your alma mater), and even community colleges can help guide your process in a way that a web site may not be so effective.

, Most people tend to do their best with having a schedule of some sort to make sure important things get done. Otherwise, they tend to be put off. Sure, you have flexibility to do fun things more or less when you want to--and on occasion this is fine--but this can become a temptation to slide into a slothful, wasteful existence. Setting up a regimen will help keep you from blowing off job-hunting, and invest your time well in things you did not have time for while working, like volunteering, exercise, hobbies, or spending time with family.

Keep up the job search. Although some people recommend spending as much time looking for a job as your would at a job, this may or may not be practical. In reality, there is often a lot of down-time even when you are diligent. People will take time getting back to you. It will take time even to simply hear back from a prospective employer about an opportunity.

Try to aim for a certain number of applications each week--this will help you keep focused.
Each day (or most days) check job websites that are likely to yield results, and also a peek at websites that are not as likely, but worth checking every week or so.



, This includes exercise, sleep, eating, and mental health.

Have a bedtime and wake-up time. Good sleep is important for good health, and easier to schedule if unemployed. It is tempting to stay up late because you can, but this can lead to obesity, depression, and make it harder to re-enter the work world once you do get hired. It is understandable to enjoy a little flexibility in sleep schedules, but in reality having it scheduled tends to make people healthier.
Plan meals. When unemployed, the temptation is to skip meals, eat poor-quality food, and eat at odd times. Again, eating more or less at regular times, and scheduling time to cook real food with real nutrition will usually be healthier and often less expensive. Even better, invite friends to dinner occasionally so you get to socialize.
Get exercise. One benefit of unemployment is often time to exercise, but if it is not planned in the schedule, it may not happen. This could be really using your gym membership, but could also be as simple as playing ""Pokemon Go"", gardening, taking walks around the block, or doing Tai Chi in the park.
Plan mental health time. Being unemployed can be a very stressful, anxious time despite having lots of ""down time"". Planning some time to take care of yourself mentally can help--and you deserve it. This will vary from person to person, but can mean time put aside for:

Hobbies: Painting, cooking, hiking, prayer, yoga, online games.
Volunteering: Helping at the local food shelf, help out at the church, library, or school, edit on Wikihow, and more.
Time with friends and family: Visit your father, take your child to the beach more, have coffee with that high school friend, offer to give your sister a night out with her husband to watch your niece and nephew, have friends over for dinner.
Projects and Learning: Now may be time to fix that lawnmower, repaint the bathroom, sew that quilt, develop that app, learn to play guitar, write that one-act play, learn Spanish, or get your GED.
Take one day off at least once every two weeks during unemployment. You will benefit from the opportunity to recharge by doing something completely unrelated to the job search, like going on a trip with a friend or just hanging around the house.

No matter what you're doing in order to make enough money to support yourself, it can technically be considered a job, even if it isn't a job in the traditional way. If you just want to avoid a job you hate or that feeling of working too hard, turn your favorite hobby into a job. No matter what you do, there is a way to monetize it.;
, There are a number of websites that will let you do quick tasks for small amounts of money. The most popular is Amazon's Mechanical Turk, but Short Task is also a good option. Keep in mind that the amount of money you get from these tasks is very small, but you should be able to do them easily while doing other tasks (like watching tv, using the toilet, or riding on the bus).

, When people go away on vacation or for business, especially if it's for a long time, they will often want to make sure that nothing goes wrong in their home or with their pets so they'll pay someone a small amount to live in their home or to take their pets until they get back. Start by house sitting for people that you know to build up references, they advertise online and in newspapers.

, Go to garage sales or hang out on websites like Craigslist and look for free or low cost items. Oftentimes you can slightly clean up an item or refurbish it a bit and get a lot more money when you resell it. Sometimes you don't need to do anything at all: people will often sell their items for less than they're worth if they just want to get rid of it quickly or they don't know what it's really worth.

, If you own a house, you can rent a small, cheap apartment for yourself and then in turn rent out your own home. If your home rents well, your temporary apartment is cheap, and your mortgage is paid off or low, then this can be a good way to make some money. It can either be a very short-term thing (such as for conventions or special events) or it can be more long-term.


Just make sure to check your cities rules regarding rentals. You can get in a lot of trouble if your city doesn't allow them without a permit.

, No, not like that. You call sell your blood, plasma, and also profit from your body in other ways, such as selling your hair, eggs, sperm, or being a test subject for medical studies. Some of these processes can be very involved and long but some are very easy.

, Lots of people have quick errands or chores that they need done but don't want to do them or don't have the time. This can range from picking up groceries to mowing the lawn, a ride to the doctor to delivering a package. A good place to find such tasks that need doing is TaskRabbit. You will usually need a background check and a car, but as long as you have those you should be able to find lots of quick ways to earn cash.

, When websites, magazines, or other media need images, instead of taking them themselves they'll often pay a small fee and license someone else's pictures. This is called stock photography. Using a high quality camera, take some good pictures and then license them through Flickr or other stock photo websites. Get enough of them and you'll make money without having to do much more.

, If you know how to do something pretty well (for example, you were really good at math in school), you can take quick and easy tutoring jobs to help kids do better in school. You can find lots of advertisements for tutors on sites like Craigslist. You'll probably need references but the money can be good for almost no work.

, There are lots of opportunities to make money by helping companies with things like advertising. You can get paid to take part in focus groups and surveys. You can also sometimes find work as a secret shopper, after which you can resell the products you buy to make money. 20|20 Panel is a common place to find opportunities like these.

, If you've got Photoshop and basic art skills, you can make money be designing some t-shirts and other products and selling them online through special retailers. Websites like Society 6 and Redbubble allow you to make clothing and household items. They'll sell, produce, and ship them for you (in exchange for a cut of the profit), but you'll still make a good chunk of money off your sales.

, Lots of websites will give you money for producing content for them. Listiverse and eHow will pay for articles you write, for example. This requires that you be able to write content quickly, though, in order to be worth the effort. Have something to say and good command of your keyboard!

, This can get pretty job-like but if you have fun and do it in a way that you enjoy then it won't be that big of a deal. Find a topic that you understand and enjoy and make blog posts, Youtube videos, etc. Ads places on your site and videos can make you a pretty tidy sum and tools like Google Ads makes it really easy to do too.

, We think that we need all sorts of things that we really don't, and these things can quickly suck up a lot of money. You want to make all those little bits of money that you made by following the first section stretch even more, right? Look at what you think of a need and reevaluate. Cell phone? Land line? TV? Candy? Fast food? gym membership? Online subscriptions? Internet? Different people need different things, depending on how they live. Just look at everything you spend money on and think: do I actually need this to survive? If you make your money through something like the internet, than the answer might very well be ""yes"".

, If you're young, live at home. This can save you a lot of money and help you build up a financial cushion so that you can more responsibly move out at a later date. If you help your parents out around the house and are generally respectful and loving, they won't even mind too much. Just make sure that they see you trying to save money and be responsible.

, Look at your monthly spending or bank statements. See any big numbers that stand out? When you look at your statements, you'll often find purchases that you really didn't think about or that you really didn't need. Paying attention to how you spend your money can make you a more conscious spender and save you lots of cash.

, Plan how you'll spend your money and stick to the plan. This will save you tons of money in the long run. A lot of the time the money we make seems to disappear, because we excuse all sorts of little purchases. Give yourself an allowance, but otherwise strictly budget your income in order to save as much money as possible.

, Clothes, food, household items: everything you buy should be at a discount. Don't go for any sale, however, that encourages you to buy something you weren't already going to buy anyway: this leads to to spend more money, not less. Get your clothes from Goodwill or garage sales. You can save a lot on food by shopping at grocery outlets and similar stores.

, Avoid credit cards or any other kinds of loaned money. This money comes with interest that you have to pay, which means that everything you pay for with the credit card actually costs more than what you're already paying for it. This can really end up costing you a lot over time. If you need a credit card to pay for something, then you either don't need it or you're living beyond your means.

, Using public transport can save you a ton of money on bills. If you have a long commute, an unlimited bus pass often costs less than just your gas bills alone. Once you factor in car payments, car maintenance, insurance, and other fees, public transport saves a ton of money. Plus, you'll have time to just relax while you get around or even use a 3G device to make even more money by doing online tasks or updating a blog while you commute.

Choose a date.,
Identify an event.,
Plan a savings target.",How to Prepare Your Finances for a Job Leave1," Some people may decide at the start of their career that they want to work to age 50, or 55, or some other number. If you would like to make this a goal, you need to set your target and then work toward it. Claiming to have a goal means nothing unless you take steps to get there, but your first step is to decide what you want., Your target to leave your present job may be some event, such as reaching a particular level of expertise or the day your supervisor leaves. Some of these targeting events may be under your control, and some may not. The less certain the event, the more prepared you will need to be.For example, you may have decided that you want to leave your present company if they ever sell out or merge with some other company. Since you cannot control something like this and may not know when it is coming, you should try to have some alternative source of employment at least in mind for when the time comes.
In the event of a maternity leave, you may not know for years exactly when it is coming, but then in the final nine months (or so) you will know almost exactly. You can plan in general to have some savings set aside, and then when you get pregnant you can begin making some specific last-minute preparations.
Sometimes, the ""event"" that triggers a temporary leave might be a long-term illness, either yours or someone you need to care for. This can come with almost no advance warning. You need to plan for the general contingency and make some emergency preparations.

, This is probably the most controllable concept. You can sit down with a financial planner and decide how much money you would need to have in savings to allow yourself and your family to survive adequately without your income. Then work toward setting aside that amount of money. As time goes by and interest rates fluctuate, you may need to adjust your plans accordingly. However, setting the target and doing the work up front will help you be as prepared as you can be.If your target is to retire early, financial experts recommend that your savings target should be about 25 times your annual salary. You will then be able to withdraw money at the rate of about 4% per year.
If you target is to be able to leave work temporarily to look for a new job or another reason, then your target will be whatever amount you need to meet your expenses for that time. For example, the average job search is approximately four to six months, so you should plan to have savings to cover your living costs for that long."

Don’t give up or become discouraged.",How to Make a Successful Midlife Career Change," Draw inspiration from all those who only ‘made it’ in later life and who credit their earlier experiences as being instrumental in equipping them for the career they (eventually) found success in.;
, Seriously consider your personal position from all relevant angles. Assess your financial situation and other practicalities you’ll have to account for. Be sure you’re not viewing a certain career through rose tinted glasses; talk to those already doing it, research it widely, and develop a genuine passion for it that’s so absolute it’s almost tangible. You will need to completely believe in the goal to ensure others will do too!

, Many older workers become overwhelmed at the thought of starting a whole new career in mid-life, but the process becomes much less intimidating if you break it down into smaller steps. You could start by taking a night class at your local community college, or reading a book or guide regarding your prospective new career. Later on, you might volunteer for a relevant organisation for a few hours a week; work shadow someone within your chosen career field; or start with consultancy or pro bono work for people you know.

, Ensure solid awareness of track record, key strengths, career highlights, and sectors where you’re most likely to create interest.

, They can offer an objective and professional viewpoint, helping to identify careers suited to your skill set, interests, background and future vision. They will assist in focusing on the target, as opposed to using a ‘scattergun’ approach by pursing too many options simultaneously.

, If you’re a worker over 50, and on the job market, one of the things you want to do is leverage your experience. This can be one of your major advantages, and experience is one thing that can’t be bought or learned out of a college textbook. Some workers are afraid to put everything on their resume for fear of appearing too old, or “over the hill” in the eyes of an employer.

, If you have college degrees, list them, but don’t give the date when they were awarded. You only need to go back 15 or 20 years when listing past jobs, and it’s best to only include experience that pertains to the job you’re seeking. Don't fossilize. Ensure resumes/curriculum vitae use the latest jargon and drop anything that has lost currency. In some industries the lingo moves on quickly so it’s pointless to use old terminology which is long gone. That is why it’s so key to research your target field, along with the fact that if you’re changing careers, chances are you’ll be shifting to an industry you don’t know much about.

, Smaller firms can be more flexible in their hiring guidelines, and tend to be more open to hiring older workers. Your skills and experience may be more valuable here than in a larger corporation. You can find a way into such firms by initially calling up the receptionist. They’re usually very willing to provide information and help.

, Social media can be very useful for job seekers and career changers of all ages.

, Attend meetings of relevant institutes and have some business cards ready to hand out. Exchange them with anyone who offers you theirs and be proactive in passing them to those you talk with. Be sure to actually get in touch with these contacts afterwards-interacting with people within your target industry is a great way to find out more about it.

, When the opportunity arises, point out your experience and positive attributes. Be sure to tell the interviewer about your past accomplishments. Project an air of energy and youthfulness, and make it clear that you intend to work for the company for a long time.

, No one is going to make your career change happen for you. Take action every day toward your goals, no matter how small. You'll probably find that once you get the ball rolling, the process begins to gain momentum and taking action will become a comfortable habit rather than something to be avoided.

, It may take a little longer, but the opportunities are out there. Just be patient, have a solid game plan, and seek out the employers that put a high value on your valuable wisdom and experience.

Work with a financial adviser.,
Invest your savings carefully.,
Cut your expenses as much as possible.,
Plan to spend some on your new job search.",How to Prepare Your Finances for a Job Leave2," If you want to plan for leaving your job, you should enlist the help of a qualified financial adviser. Someone with expertise in investing can help you decide how much you need to save and can help you find the best ways to invest. If you want some help with finding a qualified financial adviser, read Hire a Financial Advisor or Select a Financial Advisor.

, Working with your financial adviser, you will want to do more than just place your earnings in a bank account. Simple savings accounts earn very low interest. You will do better to invest in bonds, stocks or other securities, in accordance with your adviser’s opinions.


Investing works best when you begin as early as possible. Your best ally when saving is time. Your interest compounds more effectively when you begin early.
If your focus is to be able to take a temporary leave at some time, then you may need to have your savings in a readily accessible account. Long-term IRA savings are good for retirement planning, but you may need to be able to withdraw money sooner. Work with your adviser to find the best investment or savings plans for your needs.
If you want to plan for a lengthy, temporary leave, such as for a maternity or family illness, you will want to have savings in some readily accessible account. A short-term bond or money market may be the best bet, or even a simple savings account that you earmark for such an emergency., Many people live their lives from month to month and use a great deal of their income. If you manage a budget this way, you will do fine from month to month, but you will greatly delay your savings plan. If your goal is to be able to leave work, you should begin by cutting expenses as much as possible.To begin cutting expenses, start by listing them all. Then review how you spend your money over a one- to three-month period and identify the expenses that you believe you can live without. Perhaps you can reduce the number of times that you go out to dinner. Maybe you can cut some entertainment expenses.Manage your utilities. Try to reduce some of your monthly expenses by reducing utility usage in your home. Manage the heat, turn off lights, and do what you can to save water. These sound like small steps, but over time they can all add up.
Cutting expenses is a powerful financial tool for any job leave, whether permanent/retirement or a temporary leave for illness, maternity or some other reason. You need to consider the absence from work as an overall change in your lifestyle., Part of setting your target, if you are anticipating leaving your current job, should be to have some savings available to spend on a search for a new one. You will need money for correspondence, printing resumes, travel, parking, and possibly one or two new interview suits. You should anticipate these costs, estimate the amount of money that you will need, and set this aside as part of your target savings."
"
Recognize the importance of your mortgage.,
Aim for your target date.,
Refinance when possible.,
Downsize after retiring.",How to Prepare Your Finances for a Job Leave3," For most people, housing payments make up the largest expenses they have. If you are paying rent, rather than owning your residence, those monthly payments are effectively doing nothing for you. If possible, purchase a property and get a mortgage. In this way, your monthly payments will be building equity for you. At the end of your mortgage, you will own the property outright in your own name., As much as possible, try to align your mortgage to your target retirement date. That is, if you are relatively young and just starting out, then you may want to get a 30 year mortgage to last the duration of your career. However, if you can afford the monthly payments of a shorter mortgage, you will be setting aside money toward your equity at a faster rate., When mortgage interest rates go down, you should try to refinance. By refinancing, you will get a lower interest rate and reduce your monthly payments. You may also take that opportunity to refinance into a shorter term. For example, if you started out with a 30 year mortgage, you may be able to refinance to a 20-year or even 10-year mortgage, for roughly the same (or even lower) monthly payment amount. More of the money, that way, will be going to pay down the principal loan., When you do leave your job, whether for permanent retirement or as a temporary leave, you may want to consider changing your residence. Many retirees choose to move to a smaller house with a lower expenses and mortgage costs. You may also wish to move to a different part of the country with lower overall costs of living."

Investigate your employer's maternity leave benefits.,
Plan some alternative, temporary income.,
Transfer your company-based savings plans.,
Collect any payout benefits.,
Maximize stock options, if any.,
Plan for health insurance.",How to Prepare Your Finances for a Job Leave4," Some employers will offer paid maternity leave for some period of time. Others may stick to the allotted unpaid leave that is required under the Family and Medical Leave Act, which allows up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave. However, many small employers are even exempt from this. You need to find out what policy your employer has, and use that information to help you determine what financial help you will need.For a maternity leave, you can also investigate whether you can be covered under short term disability insurance. This could provide a portion of your salary during your leave. To investigate coverage, you should talk with your employer or human resources personnel, or your own insurance company.

, If you are out of work temporarily, either looking for a new job, on a maternity leave, caring for an ill family member or for some other reason, you may want to plan for some temporary work that you can do. Find something that gives you the flexibility that you need to go along with your leave, but still provides some income for you and your family. For example:Even with a new baby or an ill family member, you can probably find some time to tutor a few students a week or teach music lessons (if you have that talent).
You might be able to do some freelance writing or editing.

, If you participated in an employer-based savings or retirement plan, you should transfer that plan when you leave. Your financial adviser may be able to help you set up a personal IRA, or you might talk to an investments adviser at your bank., If your company allowed you to accrue vacation time or sick time, you might be able to cash that in and collect an additional payment in accordance with your contract. In some cases, this can be a valuable payoff amount.In some cases, you may be able to collect a partial cash payout for unused sick or vacation days to provide some cash for a temporary emergency leave, such as a family illness or bereavement leave. Even if such a benefit is not standard, you may want to talk with your employer and come up with some creative possibilities.
If you are not aware whether or not you have such a benefit, contact your company’s human resources department and ask.

, If you were granted the option to purchase stock in the company, and you have not exercised that option to its fullest potential, you should do so before leaving. These options can often be very valuable and will not be available to you later.Depending on your contract, you may have a set period of time to purchase such options upon your separation from the company.

, One of the primary benefits of employment is having health insurance. When you plan to leave, whether for permanent retirement or a temporary leave for a job change, you will need to make plans for some replacement health insurance.You may wish to investigate the following options:


If you are under age 26, your parents may be able to add you to their health plan.
If you participated in the insurance plan through your employer, you may be eligible through COBRA to continue on that plan for up to 3 years by making your own monthly payments.
Your spouse or partner may be able to add you to their health plan.

Even though there is nothing technically wrong with looking for a new job, your current employer may take it personally or become concerned that your attention is no longer focused on your work.


Telling your current employer that you are looking for a new job can harm your relationship and prevent you from being considered for new opportunities or promotions within the company. If your search for a new job turns out to be unsuccessful, this can be very bad indeed.
You should also be extremely cautious about telling your co-workers that you are looking for a new job, even if you think they are trustworthy. Telling other people at work simply increases the chance that your boss will hear about it on the grapevine. If you do end up leaving, your boss should hear it from you first, not through office gossip.;
, Many employees make the mistake of including their current boss as a reference on their resume. However, this can backfire terribly when a potential employer rings your current boss, who has no idea that you're currently job-seeking.


Putting your current boss down as a reference without telling him/her is unprofessional and can be very harmful to your relationship with them. It can also make him/her disinclined to give you a positive reference, making you less likely to get the job.
Instead, include previous employers and co-workers as your references, preferably ones you had positive relationships with and where you left the company on good terms.

, Although professional networking sites such as LinkedIn can be a great tool for self promotion, networking and knowledge sharing, you need to be careful about what information you put on your profile.


When using these sites, don't advertise the fact that you are actively searching for new jobs, or at least set your profile to private.
Avoid uploading your resume to online job websites, as someone in your company could easily see it and alert your boss.

, One of the most important considerations when searching for a new job is timing. All of your job searching should be done on your own time; do not use your work computer to job search or use your work email to send off resumes.


It is not unheard of for employees to get in trouble or even fired for job searching on the company’s time. Therefore, it is very important to be professional and maintain a good relationship with your employer.
Do your job hunting in the evenings and at weekends. It can be very tiring to maintain a full time job and search for new work opportunities, but the time and effort will pay off once you have secured a new job and have the ability to leave your current position on amicable terms.
Keep in mind that even if your current employer finds out that you are job searching, you can't get in trouble if you haven't been using company resources to do it.

, You shouldn't put your work email or phone number on your resume, as most companies screen their employee's systems and internet activity.


If you have to speak to a potential employer during the work day, try to do so on your lunch break, on a personal phone. Try to step outside while your on the call, as this decreases the chance that someone will overhear your phone conversation.
Use a personal email address to contact potential employees and refrain from checking it throughout the day. Check it once per day, after you get home from work. If an email is time sensitive and you must answer it, try to reply to it on your lunch break, from a personal device.

, If at all possible, you should avoid scheduling interviews throughout the work day. Try to organize them for before or after work hours, at the weekend, or during your lunch break (if time permits). This is the most professional approach, and your prospective employer should respect you for it, even if it is not as convenient for them.


If none of this works, then take some time off work to do the interview. Avoid lying about why you're taking the time off, as far as possible. Don't just call in sick, tell your employer that you need some time off for ""personal reasons"".
If you end up scheduling an interview for after work or during you lunch break, be careful about what you're wearing. If you normally dress casually for work but suddenly show up in a suit one day, your boss and co-workers will know that something is up. Try going home to change before your interview, or pack your interview clothes in a bag.

, When you have found a suitable match and obtained a job offer, ensure that you accept the offer, wait for references to be checked and have a start before resigning from your current job. The last thing you want is to have the new job offer withdrawn after you have resigned from your current one.


Be sure to remain professional by giving your current job adequate notice and providing a handover. This should help to avoid any hard feelings from your coworkers and superiors.
It will also be reassuring for your new employer to know that they have chosen someone with respect and a high level of professionalism.

, Searching for a new job is a big undertaking, so it’s important to be organized and make a plan. Ask yourself questions about your current role, being as honest with yourself as possible. Once you realize what’s lacking in your current position, you can figure out what you want from a new one.


Try to identify your strengths and weaknesses and your current skill set. Ask yourself whether you are happy in your current role and if it's allowing you to reach your full potential.
Figuring out the answers to these questions will help you to understand yourself better and give you a clearer idea of the direction you want your career to go in.
Once you've established a direction, you can set yourself a short-term 6 month plan and a long-term 2-5 year plan. Making detailed career plans will help you to stay focused on your goals and avoid becoming complacent.

, Once you have made a plan and know which direction you want your career to go in, the next step is to identify the kind of jobs you wish to apply for.


Having a basic idea of the direction you wish to go in will help you to streamline the job searching process. Look at job websites, job listings on specific company websites and lists of job openings on LinkedIn and search for the job title or field of interest you wish to work in.
You can look at similar job roles with other organizations and compare them with your current role. Alternatively, you can look at jobs on a higher level or in a different sector and see what skills you already have and if there are any skills you are lacking.
Don't be too concerned if your skills or experience don't match the job descriptions exactly - at this point your are just trying to get a sense of what's out there and the areas or positions that you might have an interest in working in.

, If you haven’t already, update your resume to include your current job. Write down any new skills you have gained from your current job, then relate them to your goals and what you have decided you want from a new role.


For example, if you want to change careers, prepare a functional resume to show off your transferable skills. However, if you are looking for a similar position to the one you currently hold, a chronological resume that highlights your relevant work experience will be most beneficial.
It’s great to get into the habit of updating your resume every 3 months. That way, you are constantly analyzing your own performance and working towards your goals. Even if you are not actively job searching outside the company at the moment, you never know when another attractive opportunity may come up.

, In addition to a resume, you will need to include a cover letter with each of your job applications. A cover letter is a chance for you to draw attention to important information from your resume and provide addition details. It also allows you to express why you want to work for this specific company and what personal skills or experiences uniquely qualify you for the job.


Before you start the job search process in earnest, it's a good idea to write up a sample cover letter, which you can tweak later on to make it relevant for specific jobs. Having a basic template will save you time later on.
It's very important that you tailor each cover letter to the specific job you are applying for. Generic cover letters are boring for the reader and will not make you stand out from the other applicants. A good, well-tailored cover letter will tell a prospective employer why you want to work for their company and show them how you could positively contribute to the team.
For more information on how to write a compelling cover letter, see this article.

, There are many ways to look for a new job. The most obvious way is to look for job listings online and in newspapers. Look for recently posted job opportunities that match your skills and qualifications, then send an up-to-date resume and cover letter to each employer.


Some of the best sites for job searching include CareerBuilder, Dice, Glass-door, Indeed, LinkUp, Monster and Simply Hired.

, Another way to find out about open positions is through networking. This is where you work any connections you might have or try to make new connections in order to get your foot in the door at a new company or business.


There are multiple ways to network - you can ask an employee of a company you're interested in working in out for coffee, attend large-scale networking events or simply send someone an email.

, Once you have applied to as many jobs as possible, you will hopefully start to hear back about some interviews. It's important that you be as prepared as possible for these interviews, in order to maximize your chances of getting the job. You may find the following articles helpful when preparing for any interviews:

Sufficient notice sometimes depends on the nature of your job. If you are in a professional or managerial position, then you may need additional time to transition out of the organization.If so, try to avoid setting a firm start date at the new job so that you give yourself enough time to leave your present job without causing too much disruption.
Avoid also giving too much notice. As soon as you tell the company that you are leaving, you will be perceived as an outsider.Accordingly, your continued presence at the company could make people uncomfortable.;
, One way to burn bridges with an employer is to leave at an inconvenient time, e.g., in the middle of busy period for the company. If you are an accountant, then leaving in the middle of tax season would not be ideal.


Similarly, leaving a retail job during the holiday shopping season would leave your employer in a lurch. To the extent possible, you should time your exit so that you avoid leaving in the middle of these busy periods.

, If you have an employment contract, then the contract might spell out the steps you must take before you leave the company. Pull your copy of the employment contract and read it. If you don’t have a copy, then ask Human Resources for a copy.


Should you violate your employment contract, then you could be sued. For this reason, it is critical that you understand what your responsibilities are with respect to leaving the company.

, As you prepare to leave the company, you should make sure that your physical and electronic files are properly maintained and in good order. Good organization will make it easier for your replacement to hit the ground running.If you have never bothered to organize files, then see Organize Office Files for tips.

, You should finish any large or important projects before leaving. Even if you train a replacement, that replacement will lack your depth of knowledge. If you can realistically complete an important project in your time remaining at the company, then you should do so.


Furthermore, the work you do in your final weeks should be of top quality. Don’t check out mentally, but do the kind of work your employer has come to expect from you., You should inform your supervisor first that you will be leaving the company.You do not want your supervisor to hear second-hand gossip that you are leaving. Instead, set up a time to meet so that you can inform your boss that you are leaving.


Meeting with your boss will also allow you to discuss how the rest of the organization will be informed of your departure. The news could be announced at a team meeting, in an email, or by you individually., Unless your boss wants to inform team members of your departure, you can let coworkers know individually after telling your boss. Try not to brag about your new job.Doing so could only alienate your colleagues and make it difficult to return to the company in the future.


Also make sure that you tell a consistent story about why you are leaving.People gossip. If you tell one group of people that you are leaving because the new job is too good to resist but tell another group that you are dying to leave the company, you should anticipate that your conflicting stories will get out.

, One dramatic way to ruin your relationship with your employer is to send a company-wide email on your last day, in which you make sarcastic remarks about the company or complain about aspects of the organization. These types of emails sometimes even make the national news, as when one lawyer wrote that he would rather be a “piñata and beaten” than stay at the firm.You should also think carefully before sending a positive email to the entire company. Many people won’t know who you are and will be annoyed. Furthermore, coworkers might scour the email for secret hostility.If you want to thank people, you should do so individually. Even supposedly positive emails could be misinterpreted or seen as insincere.

, The purpose of an exit memo is to outline the status of any projects or matters that you have been working on. The memo would include appropriate contact information for clients. An exit memo is particularly helpful if your employer has not hired a replacement by the time you depart.

, If necessary, offer to train your replacement.Again, this will help the company move forward after your departure. By training your replacement, you can assure that he or she has a good understanding of the job and any outstanding projects.


Furthermore, you might be able to add to your skillset by taking part in the interview, hiring, and training process. This can be invaluable for your resume.

, Larger employers tend to schedule an exit interview for individuals leaving the company. If you are offered the chance, you should agree to participate in one.


If no exit interview is offered at your company, then you should ask for one anyway.But request one only if you are confident you can be positive. Sharing what you’ve learned and expressing gratitude during an exit interview is a great way to leave a positive final impression.

, Although an exit interview may be anonymous, you should still avoid unloading on the company or trashing specific individuals.Word could get out, which would permanently damage your reputation.

, Whatever criticism you offer should be constructive. Always focus on what’s best for the company.Types of advice companies want to hear include anything that will allow employees to be more engaged in their jobs and tips for improving the workplace culture.You can also provide useful facts about salary and benefits. If you are leaving because a competitor offered a better salary and benefits package, then you might want to let your current employer know."

Focus on specifics.,
Be scientific with your description of what you need.,
Organizations vary widely in terms of how IT departments are structured and managed.,
One of the main reasons IT employees can be stubborn is that they may not have a good solution that fits with the technological schema for the organization.,
Finally, recurring problems with a specific IT professional should be reported to the department head.",How to Work With Stubborn IT Engineers," Since IT deals with a wide range of issues, it helps to classify your problem honestly. Is this something that is wrong with the way IT intended the system to work (bug), or is it a shortcoming of the system (feature request)? This is often the most contentious part of dealing with IT, as different perceptions require different solutions. Try to see the issue from the other side.


IT's primary goal is to ensure that the system is working for the ""average"" user and that mission critical systems are online. If they are dismissive of your problem, it may be because the order system is down and the sales department can't place orders (i.e. make money). A certain level of patience is needed in these emergency settings.
Once this initial level of triage is done, you may simply encounter stubborn people in the IT department. This may be stereotypically characteristic, but it is not always true. Most IT professionals pride themselves on being helpful. Start the conversation by asking for their help with a problem, not by telling them what to do. You may be surprised how far this gets you.;
, Nobody expects you to understand the inner workings of the network or computers, but a calm, rational description of the facts surrounding the problem will save everyone hours of headaches.

, If you cannot resolve your issue with the engineer that you're working with, you should feel free to escalate to someone higher on the food chain. When you do so, be sure that your technical issue is the focus of the conversation, not the IT professional. If you're not comfortable doing this yourself, ask your manager to do so for you.

, For instance, giving you certain access to a system may be simple to you, but it opens up a security hole in a process mandated by corporate policy. IT is constantly torn between helping individuals and serving the company as a whole. If you need an exception in policy, it will need to be approved at a higher level before you start working with a Technician.

, Most IT departments have a feedback mechanism that they take very seriously. If you provide thoughtful, constructive feedback, you are likely to see change. Feel free to ask them for statistics on trouble tickets. Most IT departments post these on a website or in a company newsletter. If you want to dig deeper, ask for more information. You may find something that could help.

Look for signs of burnout.,
Check your work-life balance.,
Ask yourself if you have become good at something you dislike.,
Pause to consider if the “right” career choices feel wrong.,
Look for ways to pursue your talents and interests.,
Assess the link between your pay and your satisfaction.",How to Know if You Need a Career Change1," If every day of work seems like a chore, you could be suffering from burnout. This is a kind of psychological stress that stems from deep dissatisfaction with work and/or its impact on non-work aspects of your life. Common symptoms of burnout include:Constant fatigue
Feelings of depression related to work
Increased rates of illness
Dreading going to work
Feeling underappreciated or abused at work;
, Work is an important part of many people’s lives, so much so that it becomes a primary part of their identity. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing. However, if your work leaves you no time to concentrate on other aspects of your life, you might be dissatisfied. Ask yourself if your current career allows enough time for things like:Family
Friends
Pursuing hobbies or non-work interests
Rest and relaxation

, Sometimes people become dissatisfied with a career even if they’re very good at it. You may have developed skills or even become a leader in your field doing something you actually don’t want to do.For instance, you might be a successful trial lawyer but hate every time you have to step in the courtroom. Likewise, you might be an award-winning teacher but hate have to spend most of your time grading and doing lesson plans.
If you’re in a situation like this, consider if your skills could be applied to a different career. For instance, a teacher might switch careers to become a corporate trainer. This would allow them to continue using skills in communication and motivating others, without having to worry about grading and lesson plans.

, Maybe you have everything lined up to gain a promotion or prestigious management position that would be the next step up on your career ladder. If you have significantly mixed feelings about this, can’t shake the sense that it’s the wrong choice, or think about how you might regret it, these could be signs that you’re looking for a different path., Ideally, everyone would be able to be successful in a career that utilized their skills and talents in a rewarding and meaningful way. You may already feel this way in your current career. If so, ask yourself whether a potential new career would capitalize on your skills even more. If not, ask yourself if the new career is something that you would find fulfilling and that would be a good use of your skills.For example, you might feel like you're a great communicator, but feel stuck in the accounting department of a big firm because it doesn't involve working with others very much. You might be ready to switch into a new career.

, Whatever your career and life goals are, if you're working for pay, then your wages will matter. Finding a good balance between pay and job satisfaction doesn't necessarily mean that you'll become wealthy from any job you may have. It does mean that you will feel like your work is being valued.Feeling like you aren't being adequately compensated can make you consider seeking a new career path.

Determine what you would want from a new career.,
Take a career interest quiz.,
Consult someone who works in the field you are interested in.",How to Know if You Need a Career Change2," If you are serious about and ready for a career change, then you don't want to make a rash decision. Part of what you can do to determine if you are ready is decide what you want out of a new career. Some possibilities include:Professional or intellectual challenges you don't find in your current career.
Greater responsibility than your current career allows, such as the opportunity to manage others.
A more flexible schedule, or one that fits your other commitments and interests.
Chances to pursue interests that aren't related to your current career.

, Many tests have been developed to assess how the skills and interests you have relate to potential careers. If you are considering a career change, take one of these tests and see if the results sound like professions that would interest you. You can ask a career center about one of these tests, and many are freely available online as well. Some well-known career tests include:The Strong Interest Inventory (SII)
The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)
The Career Ability Placement Survey (CAPS)

, If you're curious about a new career path and wondering if you're ready to switch to it, talking to someone who works in the field will help you get an inside view. Consider what you learn from them--the good and the bad--to help you decide if you're ready for the switch.Ask for a no-strings attached informational interview.
Job shadow a friend or contact working in the career you're interested in.
Make sure to ask about both positives and negatives in the new career. If the downsides seem like too much, then you may not be ready for a career change.

"
"
Make sure you have a real motivation to switch careers.,
Assess the financial impact of the switch.,
Think honestly about the impact on your self-perception.,
Talk to your loved ones about the potential change.,
Test the waters.",How to Know if You Need a Career Change3," Reconfiguring your professional self takes commitment. Before you switch, identify one or more good reasons for doing so.Things that may cause dissatisfaction at your current job--including feeling constantly underutilized, unfulfilled, stressed, underpaid, and so on--could potentially be good reasons for consider a career change.
A temporary stress (like a big project with a definite end date), or issues that may be “fixable” (like asking for a higher salary) might not be good reasons to rush into a career change.

, Changing careers might mean a pay raise, or it might mean taking a pay cut in order to do something that is more fulfilling. If you are transitioning between careers, you might also find yourself in situations where you are working only part-time as you gain skills and experience. In any case, a career change can have significant financial consequences, and you’ll want to think them through. Ask yourself questions like:If I have to work part-time for a while or take a break from working at all, will I be able to stay financially afloat?
Are the long-term income prospects of a new career adequate for my basic needs, lifestyle and goals?
Am I willing to take a pay cut and sacrifice some things in order to pursue a career that matters more to me?
Do I feel like I need to move into a career that pays more than my current one?

, Since careers are so closely tied to personal identity, changing jobs will change the way you think about yourself to some extent. Make sure you’re ready for this.


Will you take pride in the new career?
Will you be able to talk about how the change fits into your personal and professional goals?
Do you see yourself regretting the change down the road?
Will you feel as professionally fulfilled in a new career?
Are you willing to redefine your priorities in order to pursue a new career?

, In many cases, a potential career change won’t just impact you, but also your family and even “surrogate” family, like close friends. Think about whether your loved ones will support your career shift, how it will impact them, and whether or not the change is in everyone’s best interest.Will changing careers impact other family obligations you may have? For instance, if you are a teacher with time off in the summer, will changing careers alter your childcare commitments, vacation plans, or other other things?
If you’re ready to make a career change, your loved ones don’t necessarily have to be immediately on board with the plan. However, you should be able to talk to them about why you think the change is important, and a good idea, and pull together to find solutions to make it work.

, Before making a headlong dive into a new career, you can try taking small measures, like signing up for an online or traditional course in the field, or freelancing in the area. That way, you can gauge your interests and see if you are ready to make a career switch, without fully committing right away.If you're a dental hygienist thinking about opening your own cupcake business, maybe start by taking a class in business basics to see if you can commit to the idea.
If you’re a lawyer looking to become a writer, you might test things out by freelancing a bit on the side as a start.

Try to limit interactions.,
Be nice to the offending person.,
Separate your work life from your personal life.,
Report the situation if it gets out of hand.,
Keep a healthy perspective.,
Detach from the situation emotionally.,
Find a support system outside of work.,
Consider your co-worker's perspective.,
Review past interactions with the co-worker.,
Evaluate your stress level.",How to Work With Someone Who Hates You," While it's not always possible to completely avoid a co-worker, you can strive to keep interactions as infrequent as possible. Simply avoiding interaction is probably the easiest way to cope.


Some interactions are probably unavoidable, especially if you two work together directly. However, you can avoid chatting with this co-worker in the break room or during downtime. If you notice your co-worker come in, politely excuse yourself by saying something like, ""Well, got to get back to work. Nice seeing you.""When you do have to interact with the co-worker, keep things professional. Avoid bringing up personal matters or things irrelevant to the task at hand as, when dealing with someone who dislikes you, this is an invitation for negative interaction.;
, Many psychological studies indicate that it's very difficult to dislike someone who likes you. If your co-worker feels you respect and like him or her, some of the dislike he or she may have towards you might fade.Tell someone else in the office that you like and respect the problem co-worker. That information may get repeated secondhand. When such a message does not come directly from you, your co-worker may be more likely to believe it.Show a genuine interest in your co-worker's input. People tend to like people who pay attention and engage with them. While you should still stick to avoiding this person when possible, during the times you do have to interact listen to what he or she says actively. This might make your co-worker's dislike you less.Small, friendly interactions can help as well. Something as simple as ""good morning"" can go a long way., If you have trouble interacting with a particular colleague, try to separate your work life from your personal life. You do not have to socialize with colleagues outside of work. If the co-worker who dislikes you is frequently part of Friday night happy hours, forego these events and seeing the friends you know from outside work., You do not want to report behavior unnecessarily. However, you should certainly report any behavior that's interfering with your ability to do your job. Talk to Human Resources if the situation gets out of hand.


Management can help negotiate situations if your ability to do your job is threatened. You should keep a record of your interactions for a week or so if you plan to report just so you have solid information to show to officials.Make sure you focus on how your co-worker's behavior affects the company. Speak in objective terms and explain about how productivity and morale are damaged by your co-worker's attitude.Remember, this is a last resort. You do not want to get labeled the office tattletale. You should only report your co-worker if you feel he or she is harassing you, attacking you personally, and is persistent in his or her actions despite your attempts to avoid or rectify the situation., Emotionally, keeping a healthy perspective is one of the best ways to cope with a negative co-worker. Stay focused on your larger dreams and career goals. Avoid getting caught up in petty workplace drama.


When you get frustrated, consider where you want to be in the next year or the next five years. How much does this co-worker really matter when it comes to your longterm goals? How long will you actually be working together? It's more than likely your troublesome co-worker will not be part of your career for the long run.Can you learn from the situation? Try to see the situation as a lesson in how to treat others. If your co-worker's dislike is making work difficult, do not replicate that kind of behavior in any future interactions., While it's easier said than done, sometimes the best way to deal with a negative situation is to find a way to remove yourself emotionally. Try to simply ignore the behavior by refusing to react to it.It can help to engage in relaxation techniques throughout the day. You can try steadying your thoughts by hyper focusing on the present moment. Take stock of your body, your breathing, your surroundings. This will stop you from becoming upset by your co-worker's actions by placing focusing on the physical alone., Whatever you do, do not bad talk your co-worker to other people in the office. This will not only reflect poorly on you, it can easily get back to your co-worker and make the situation worse.


Everyone needs to vent sometimes. It's okay if you want to get your frustrations off your chest. However, keep your venting outside the office. Talk to friends and family members you know from outside work rather than acquaintances from the office., While it might be difficult to accept, there could be something you're doing to make your co-worker dislike you. Try to consider your co-worker's perspective to see if there's been any bad behavior on your part.


Jealousy often fuels dislike. Your co-worker could see you as more successful or see traits in you that he or she lacks. While you can't necessarily eliminate your co-worker's jealousy, consider whether you've been overly smug or boastful about your success. If so, this may be fueling the dislike.People can mistake shyness as rudeness. If you simply do not interact with your co-worker frequently, he or she might think you're cold. Trying to be a bit friendlier can help.Do other people in the office seem to like you? If not, you may be inadvertently engaging in behavior others find off-putting. Try talking to a co-worker you're close to and ask him for objective feedback on your behavior. See if there's anything you're doing that could be off putting to others., Carefully review any past interactions you've had with your co-worker. Sometimes, people dislike others for a single bad interaction. There may have been something you said or did that's fueling the dislike.


It could be something simple, like you not holding the elevator by mistake one day. You could have also accidentally said something insensitive, like a comment on your co-worker's outfit he or she took the wrong way.If you identify any past mistakes on your part, offer your co-worker a sincere apology. If the dislike stems from a simple misunderstanding, it can probably be cleared up with a quick conversation., Be honest with yourself about how much the situation is bothering you. If you're unable to separate your work life from your private life, it may be time to look for another job. Be aware, however, that difficult people exist in every profession. If difficult co-workers really get to you, it might be a good idea to see a therapist about managing your overall stress.

Remember first and foremost that Executive Recruiters are for the most part, just doing their job in a difficult and often misunderstood environment.,
Understand that Executive Recruiters are paid by the company for whom they are recruiting.,
Set your expectations low when it comes to expected communication from your recruiter.,
Always be positive and maintain a good attitude.,
Don't call or check in too often.,
Be open and honest with your recruiter, but don't share too much.,
Keep in mind that just because you are qualified for a position, does not mean that you are one of the most qualified candidates for the position.

,
Be helpful and treat your recruiter with respect.,Treat them the way that you want to be treated.",How to Work With an Executive Recruiter," The #1 complaint that most candidates have with Recruiters is their lack of communication. However, the problem is that any successful recruiter will have hundred of candidates to communicate with at any given time.;
, The company with the job is the client of the Executive Recruiter. Except in very rare circumstances, candidates don't pay fees.

, As mentioned above, any successful recruiter will have very limited time and more phone calls to make in a day than he can possibly make in any given day.

, Candidates with attitudes rarely get called back. Recruiters may refuse to call candidates back simply because they appeared to have a bad attitude.

, There is a big difference between appearing motivated and desperate. A quick email once per week should suffice.

, Treat every conversation with your recruiter like you would a conversation with the hiring company.

,, It is very common to see candidates work with an Executive Recruiter until they have a job and then they fall of the face of the earth and never speak with that recruiter again.

Leave at the top of your game.,
Consider how leaving will impact your career.,
Leave if you lack passion.,
Leave if you are miserable.,
Leave if you dislike the people you work with.,
Leave if your career has stagnated.,
Leave if your company is sinking.,
Consider leaving if you are experiencing verbal abuse or sexual harassment.Successfully dealing with workplace bullying or harassment is not easy; over 75% of targets eventually leave, either involuntarily or by their choice to escape the situation.,

Stay connected.",How to Leave a Job," It may seem counter-intuitive, but the best time to leave you job is when it is going well, because having accolades to discuss will make you a more attractive job candidate. So if you can’t see a long-term future at your job, or have a dream you want to pursue elsewhere, then prepare to leave, even if you’re successful.If you don’t like your job, it’s easy to not give it 100%, but remember that especially if you are planning on leaving, it is important to excel as much as possible, whether that means working extra hours or taking on extra projects. In the long run, it will be worth it.
Even if you love your job, you should consider leaving if it is not exactly what you want to do. Having a good job that you like and succeed at breeds confidence, which is vital for landing a new job or starting a new business.;
, Leaving a job too quickly can raise red flags when you look for future jobs.


Be careful about leaving a job you just started, as it will upset the people who hired you and might damage future job prospects. Remember that it can take several months to adjust to the people, systems, politics, and hours of a new job.If you are still unhappy after two months, discuss your concerns with your manager. If you are working longer hours than anticipated, or if the nature of the work is not what you thought it would be, then discuss ways to adjust the work. Working through the situation is preferable to quitting.
Age and responsibility matter when deciding how soon you can quit. Generally, the younger you are and the less responsibility you have, the quicker you can walk away. For example, if you hate waiting tables at your new job, then don’t be afraid to tell your manager after a couple of weeks.
If you are an experienced professional like a lawyer at a new firm, there will be a stigma to walking away quickly. If you are a CEO, then the stigma will be even greater. Make a good faith effort to work through any problems. Then, if you do decide to walk away sooner than anticipated, your efforts to make it work will soften the blow., If you’re not heading to work with a feeling of excitement most days, then you are not passionate about your job. And if you lack passion, your job will eventually come to feel like a grind.Don’t stay in a job if you don’t feel like you have a future there. Remember, it usually takes up to a year to find a new job, so start preparing to leave now.Being passionate means that means you need to buy into both the company mission and the nature of the work. Remember: a great job for one person might not be the job for you.If you feel like your company is not providing true value to its customers, or if you want to change the world and instead feel like a cog in a machine, move on.
If your job requires you to travel more than you would like, or does not offer enough upward mobility, move on.If your pay is the primary reason that you are working, then it is time to consider leaving your job., If you dread going to work every day, then it is time to move on.Does thinking about your job make you anxious?
Do you feel like you are working too much? Do you lack the work-life balance you desire?
Is your job impacting your mental or physical health? Are you gaining or losing weight? Are you suffering from depression? Do you feel constantly tired and run down?

, If you don’t enjoy and respect the people you work with, or if you have problems with the corporate culture, then you need to get ready to move on., If you have been passed over for promotion, your attempts to take on more challenging assignments have failed, your ideas are not being heard, your contributions go unrecognized, or you are no longer growing and learning, then your career has stagnated.This may mean it is time to look elsewhere, but first, you’ll want to make an effort to revive your career.


Make sure you know your stuff. Focus on the skills that the company needs and you are passionate about.If you’re a software developer, that might mean being the best at writing code. If you’re a salesperson, you need to be skilled at closing sales. If you’re a lawyer, you might focus on knowing the ins and outs of the law in a certain field, arguing cases in court, or on bringing in clients.
Spend informal time with the leaders and co-workers you most respect to find out about the company’s most important priorities, the most critical challenges and how you can help achieve the company’s goals. Don’t just be eager to contribute, be eager to contribute where your help is needed most.
Make yourself the person others come to for advice. Being open and helpful to others is a great way to show your value to a company and to build a network of people who are committed to your success.

, You will be a more attractive job candidate if you can move on before your company fails.Recognizing a failing company is easy if you're in the accounting department. If not, look for these subtler warning signs you’re your company, or your position, might soon disappear:


There are cut back on the little things. Has your usual coffee been replaced by a cheaper brand? Are you running shot on office supplies, which are now only replaced after you complain? Has the training budget been slashed? Are travel expenses and perks being more tightly scrutinized or only paid at the last minute? Is the HR department suddenly more concerned with how accurately you record your hours worked? These cost-cutting measures are often the first sign that a company is struggling.There are multiple resignations – or perhaps a mass updating of LinkedIn profiles – in the accounting and finance department. These people are typically the first to know when the company is struggling. If they are leaving, you should probably get out, too.The company is looking to the payroll to save cash. Maybe you are not paid on time, or your superannuation (or 401K), although deducted from your payslip, is not actually being placed in your superannuation fund. Or maybe raises have ceased or there is a hiring freeze.The company is struggling to pay its bills. You might notice that suppliers will now only do business on a cash-on-delivery basis, or hear that the company has received demand letters from legal firms chasing bill payment.The company is restructuring. If you or fellow employees are frequently being shuttled between different departments of bosses, this may be a sign that the company is struggling to find its footing. A new CEO or president is often the catalyst for such structural changes.There are lots of closed doors. If your boss or CEO appears stressed and is frequently in closed door meetings, this may be a sign that trouble is brewing., If you are being bullied, criticized publicly in a demeaning fashion or sexually harassed, you should leave if you cannot resolve the situation in one of these ways:In a large company, consider changing departments or locations, if possible.
Consider taking time off. Workplace trauma can be overwhelming. Take time off so that you can approach your situation with a clear head, and decide if you want to leave or try to resolve the situation.
Research your options. Talk to an attorney, particularly if you feel like discrimination plays a role (it does in a quarter or workplace bullying cases). Look at your company’s internal policies for violations to report.
Expose the problem. Go to the highest level person you can reach and make your case. You will be most likely to succeed if you focus on the economic cost of the bully.

Bullying and harassment creates turnover, which means money and time spent recruiting new employees, paying hiring bonuses and moving costs, training them, etc. The cost is generally around 1.5 times the annual salary of each new hire.
Bullying and harassment drives talented people from work, resulting in the loss of their contributions.
Targets of bullying and harassment often take more time off, resulting in lost productivity.
A real or even potential lawsuit against the firm that allowed the bullying or harassment can result in expensive legal costs.



, It is generally better to keep your job while looking. This will keep you in touch with industry contacts that can help you get a job, and most firms prefer to hire people who are currently employed.However, there are reasons to quit without another job lined up:


If the stress of your job is so great that it is compromising your ability to seek employment, then you may be better off quitting to focus on your job search.Quitting for family reasons – to care for a newborn or raise children – is generally seen as an acceptable reason for a career gap.If you are planning on starting your own business, then you will usually need to quit your current job to devote adequate time to the new venture., In most cases, you will want to keep your search a secret even from your boss, and especially form your coworkers. Don’t let them know until you are ready to leave, as this will create tension in your current workplace and often lead to a search to replace you as soon as possible.The exception is if you have a very close relationship with your boss, of if he or she has warned you about upcoming layoffs and offered to help in your job search., Even co-workers who are not part of your online social networks may be checking your profile.Instead, use your professional network more discretely:


Don’t wait until you are searching for a job to develop a network.
Keep your LinkedIn profile up to date, but don’t mention you are looking for a job. LinkedIn is one of the first places hiring managers will look when weighing your application for a job.Increasing your visibility is key. Join LinkedIn groups with people in your profession, preferably those one or two stations higher. Like their comments, and then reach out privately to say you liked the comment they made and ask to connect.
Catch up with contacts you have made through your work. You don’t need to ask for a job. Focus on their work and the needs of their company. Again, the key is increasing visibility. If they happen to need someone in your field, then you can mention that you are interested. Be sure to ask that they keep your search confidential.Use professional organizations. Annual meetings are a particularly effective place to network, but again, be sure to ask that your search be kept private.
Stay positive. While it is tempting to bemoan your current situation, it is also counterproductive. Focus on the future: your ideal job, your talents, and your results. If asked why you are leaving, simply say you want a position where you can use more of your talents., You don’t want your boss learning about your search from someone calling to check a reference.If your only references are from your current job:


Direct your potential employer to a recommendation or endorsement on your LinkedIn profile to show success at your current job.Emphasize to potential employers that your search is confidential, and tell them that upon receiving a signed offer letter, you will happily let them check with your current management and coworkers.If you do decide to list references at your current job earlier in the hiring process, choose people you trust not to reveal your search, or people who have recently left the company. Be sure to speak with your managers or coworkers before listing them as references., Don’t use company phones, email or internet. Don’t look for jobs while at the office. And schedule interviews during non-work hours., If you dress business casual and need a suit for an interview, then change outside the office., It is easy for enthusiasm to slip once you begin a job search, but if you do not continue to work hard and complete work on time, people will take notice., By lying, you will ruin your credibility and the chance of your boss serving as a future reference., Finding a new job takes time. Schedule regular hours outside of work to conduct your search., Consider what you are looking for in terms of responsibilities and company culture.Compensation and benefits are important, but focus on the job more than the money., Favor quality over quantity, and don’t waste time sifting through huge job sites.Use your business network. Referrals are 5 to 10 times more effective than applying directly. Accordingly, you should devote at least 50% of your time to networking and consulting your network.Look for companies rather than jobs. Set up informational interviews at companies you would like to work at. This sort of networking will put you in a good position to land a job if one does open up.Consider job sites that regularly email you job listing that fit your criteria, or sites specific to your field., Avoid over-used terms and phrases: motivated, innovative, dynamic, detail oriented, team player, excellent communication skills. Show, don’t tell: let the work you did and what you accomplished show that you are a motivated, dynamic worker., Especially if you applying directly instead of through a contact in your network, your cover letter needs to grab the hiring manager’s attention. It is your chance to expand on your résumé and show why you are perfect for the job.

, Now that you’ve found a great job and used your contacts or stellar résumé to get noticed, you need to shine at the interview to seal the deal.


Dress appropriately. If you’re not sure what to wear, then call the companies Human Resources department, tell them you are coming for an interview, and ask about the dress code.Project positive body language: no nervous ticks (jiggling a leg or touching your face); don’t slouch or sit to rigidly.
Prepare answers to commonly asked questions. You don’t need to memorize anything, but do know generally how you will respond and come prepared with a few sound bites for questions like:What is your biggest weakness?
Where do you see yourself in five years?
What interests you about this opening?
Why did you / are you leaving your last job?


Present your answers as short stories. Use your résumé as a platform to tell a compelling story about your career path, and always be sure to validate your statements about your skills, attitude, etc. with specific examples from real job situations., All of the advice below falls under this broad category. You can’t be sure you won’t have to work with the same people later in your career, or need their recommendation for another job.Be sure to tell your most valued coworkers – the people whose contacts you want to continue to cultivate – as soon as possible after you give notice. Thank them for their support at the company and tell them you will stay in touch.Be honest and straightforward about your plans. Your coworkers will find out about your new job as soon as you update your LinkedIn profile. Keeping them informed yourself will help to preserve relationships.Don’t give different reasons for your departure to different people. For example, if you tell your boss you are leaving to pursue a better opportunity and a coworker that you are leaving because you hate your boss, it’s only a matter of time before the discrepancy comes to light. Tell one story, one way., Schedule a meeting to let your boss know. This shows respect and self-confidence on your part. Don’t feel obligated to explain your reasons at length.Make it clear that your departure is not a criticism of the company, but rather a pursuit of personal opportunity.Try something like:“I have recognized the need to move on with my career and have found a good next step.”
“I’ve been happy here, but have found an offer I can’t refuse (e.g. shorter commute, exceptional money, greater responsibility).”


Be ready to answer “Why are you leaving?” Keep it simple: “It is an offer I could not ignore to further my career” or “I have an opportunity to…”Be ready to answer “Where are you going?” You are not required to tell your boss where you are going. If it is to a competitor, then telling them may upset them. Simply reiterate that you have a good opportunity elsewhere, thank them for all you have learned at your current job, and move on in the conversation, perhaps by discussing ways in which you are willing to help with the transition.
Be appreciative. Thank your boss for the support and opportunities you have received.Offer to help to minimize the impact of your departure. Bring a list of ongoing projects with status updates and suggestions for completion. If willing, offer to train your replacement.Make sure you clarify details such as your leave date and how you will inform others – both colleagues and clients.
Ask about references. Making sure you leave with a good references can be vital in subsequent job searches., When you resign, your boss may be angry. Or, he or she may try to persuade you to stay. You need to be ready for either eventuality.


Your boss’s initial reaction may be anger. Be prepared to wait it out without losing your cool. Remember: you are not doing anything wrong by leaving. This is business, not personal. If you handle yourself with grace, your boss is more likely to give a positive reference once they have recovered from their surprise.Your boss may ask why you did not mention your desire to leave before. Remember to focus on the positives. “Thank your for the opportunity here, but I have received an offer that is too good to pass up.”Your employer may ask you to stay on until they find a replacement. Decide beforehand if you are willing to do so, and stick to that decision.Your employer may offer you more money to stay. If your boss goes to the trouble to find more money to keep you, and you still leave, this can make him or her angry. To avoid this situation, be very clear about your intention to leave when you first inform your boss, and make it clear that money is not the primary reason – i.e. it’s your dream job or it comes with certain opportunities that aren’t available in your present position., After informing your boss in person, you will need to formally tell your manager and human resources that you are resigning. Keep it simple. Save the more detailed discussion for your conversation with your manager.


Include today’s date, your manager’s name, title and the company name. Keep it simple: “Effective , I am resigning my position as in the .”You may also include a sentence thanking your employer. I.e. ""I have enjoyed working here and particularly appreciate/would like to thank you for...""Finally, you may include a statement of your willingness to help with the transition. I.e. ""I will do my utmost to complete existing projects and to assist where possible in the hand-over process.”, Two weeks is the minimum. If your are in a position with a special skill set, it is better to give more advanced warning and to offer to train your replacement. If you are a vital part of a project that is ending in a few months, offer to stay on until the project is completed., It may feel good at the time to dress down your boss or an annoying colleague, but it can come back to bite you if you work for or with them again. Be professional and polite.


Even if you hate your boss, letting then know when you leave is self-defeating. They will get over it quickly. All you have done is destroy a relationship you may someday need and eliminated a potentially important reference. When you attack your boss as you leave, they win.If you are leaving because you were harassed or bullied, it can be difficult to keep your emotions at bay. Be sure to have a scripted, positive answer for when people ask you why you are leaving.
If your boss becomes abusive when you inform you are leaving, be prepared to simply walk out. Say something like, “I wanted to offer two weeks to help transition my work, but I’m not willing to be yelled at or treated this way, so today will be my last day.”, This will leave a good impression and win you the respect of coworkers, who you may need as future references. If you have nothing to do, then offer to leave earlier., Make sure those replacing you or taking over your projects are up to speed. Transfer information and contacts to those who need them. Clean out your inbox., Pen a note to the people who you worked with most. Even if you had a difficult relationship with your boss, thank him or her. It is always best to leave a positive impression., Again, you don’t want to burn any bridges; you may end up working with the company again. If you are going to bring up issues, try to frame it as constructive criticism., Contacts you made within your office or with clients may prove vital in future work and in helping you get future jobs. Don’t lose them. Here are some tips for staying in touch:


Keep a list. Before announcing you are leaving, make a spreadsheet with the contact info of people you respect and would want to work with professionally in the future. Depth is more important than breadth. Save these spots for people who want to help you as much as you want to help them.Let contacts know that your old work email will no longer be operative. Notify them that you are on LinkedIn and suggest they connect with you there.Schedule follow-up. Put entries in your calendar reminding you to follow up with contacts every two or three months. Ask them how they are doing, and if you can help out in any way.Stay in touch in other ways. Pass along blogs or news stories you think your contacts would like. Connect to them on LinkedIn and keep track of their status. If they are promoted, congratulate them. If they are laid off, offer support. If you have a recreational activity in common, send them articles about it. Thank them if you take their advice and it helps."

Talk about what happened.,
Make sure you get all your stuff.,
Go to work separately.,
Don’t tell anyone.,
Confess if you get caught.,
Avoid gossiping about what happened.,
Be professional at work.,
Don’t do it again.,
Build a relationship beyond work.,
Disclose it to your boss.,
Have an exit strategy.",How to Treat a Co Worker After a One Night Stand," Make sure you both understand what happened, and what your future intentions are. Be clear and direct with each other, as you don’t want the other person to start making dinner plans for you two when you were just looking for a fling. Talking about it in advance will help prevent uncomfortably unclear moments in the office.


If you don’t think it’s a good idea to date, say so. If this is someone you work closely with, that fact is a good excuse that won’t sound so accusatory. Something like “I don’t want this to get in the way of our professional relationship,” should get the point across. If you don’t work closely together, you can be more direct, saying that you aren’t really interested.
If one of you left early, and you didn’t get a chance to talk, have a brief private meeting at the office.
You should always be respectful when talking to your partner. About half of all women, and 20 percent of all men, will experience negative feelings about themselves after a one night stand, usually shame for what they did or like they’ve been used for sex.Avoid statements that can be misconstrued, like ""I can't believe we did that,"" or ""I've made a huge mistake."";
, Or, if it was at your place, that your co-worker gets all of her or her stuff. You don’t want someone to have forgotten something, and need to go back later to pick it up. It’s going to be awkward enough at work the next day, you don’t want to compound the embarrassment by having to see each other after work again.This also means not “accidentally” leaving something that you need to pick up later. If you think you want your one night stand to turn into something more, that is not the way to go about it.

, You want to minimize gossip, or at least avoid drawing attention to what happened. Avoid carpooling or taking the same train into the office so that you can arrive at different times., What happened between the two of you should stay between the two of you. Avoid broadcasting information about you and your partner, even to people you think you trust. Gossip spreads quickly, and telling one person probably means the rest of the office will know shortly.

That means on social media too. Businesses keep an eye on the kinds of things you post on social accounts, and it will be hard to keep people from prying if you are suddenly “In a relationship,” or “It’s complicated.” Hold off on announcing anything on those places until your relationship becomes serious.

, If your boss learns about your hook-up, or confronts you about what happened, be honest. He doesn’t need to know all the steamy details, but you shouldn’t lie about it. Your relationship may or may not be a problem, depending on your office’s rules. Lying about it, though, can cause problems for you and your co-worker, as well as cause your boss to lose trust in you.

If your other co-workers think they’ve figured it out, you don’t want to lie to them. It will only make it worse if last night’s partner isn’t telling the same story. Remember that you don’t have to tell them anything, and feel free to remind them that it’s none of their business.

, Beyond not telling others, you don’t want to start sharing intimate or embarrassing details about your partner. While it may feel fun or liberating to talk about her interesting birthmark, or his odd bedroom requests, consider how you would want to be treated. Gossiping about your co-worker is unprofessional, and will make it difficult for the two of you to maintain a good working relationship. And, you can be sure, your co-worker will learn it was you who told everyone., While it is going to be awkward at times, you need to try and act as if nothing happened. Keep your regular routine and meetings, and don’t be afraid to steer any personal conversations back to work.

This also means not avoiding the person at well. Awkwardly trying to prevent talking to the other person will probably draw attention to you, and make it harder to do your job. Doing what you’re paid to do should be the priority for both of you at the office., Even if this time was a mistake, you want to be careful about getting a reputation as someone who sleeps around the office. That sort of behavior will make it difficult for others to work with you, and can negatively affect your career. Also, you will have a hard time being taken seriously by someone else in the office you might actually have an interest in., It can be easy to start a bond because of your shared experiences, including work projects, bad bosses, or any of the other things that take up your working hours. If you decide you both decide you want this to be something more, though, that won’t be enough. Look for things other than work that you can enjoy doing together., If you thought the morning after conversation was uncomfortable, this can be even more so. Still, it is important that your personal relationship be disclosed to avoid trouble with company policy. The most senior person, or the one who has been there the longest, should be the one to initiate the conversation with management., Let’s face it, most relationships don’t work. Unfortunately, with office relationships, you have to continue seeing and working with the person even after it’s ended. While you may be able to stay friendly with one another, it may end up being too much. Make sure you have some idea of what you might do if the relationship goes south. That could mean moving within the company, or taking a new job altogether.

Let everyone contribute to the discussion.,
Listen well.,
Don't shut down ideas.,
Draw in the holdouts.",How to Work Well in a Team Environment1," When you're meeting together, it's important that everyone has a chance to speak. Try not to cut off your peers, and if you notice other people getting cut off, speak up to let each person have their say.For example, you could say, ""Sorry, Rob, I'm not sure John was through. Did you have something else to say, John?"";
, In addition, it's important to actually hear what your peers are saying. Often, you may be thinking hard about the project and want to jump in with what you have to say. However, in that time you spent thinking, you haven't heard what someone else is saying. Make sure you take time to hear each other out, as otherwise, you'll never be on the same page.If you find your mind drifting on an idea, jot a quick note down, then refocus on what other people are saying.
Remember to make eye contact with the person who is speaking and lean in towards him or her. Put away anything that might distract you as well, such as your cell phone or laptop.
You can also try nodding your head while the person is talking to show the person that you are listening.
Avoid interrupting the person while he or she is speaking. Wait until he or she has finished to ask questions or make comments., You may be set on one idea. In fact, you may think it's the only way to work through a situation your team is facing or a problem you're working on. However, you can't just shut down other people's ideas. For one, it will keep them from wanting to speak up later. More importantly, someone may have a better idea if you give it a chance to develop.Sometimes, an idea can sound outrageous at first, and you'll want to reject it immediately. It may take you a little while to warm up to the idea and see that it actually could work, particularly if it's out of the box.
Ask more questions about the idea to better understand the logistics. Even if the idea doesn’t work, it could be a springboard for other ideas.

, You'll likely find that there's someone on your team who doesn't quite know how to work well on a team. They may be shy, or they may have never been taught how to work with others. If that's the case, try to draw them out.Invite them to speak out when they're quiet in group meetings. Ask them questions to get them talking.
In addition, figure out what they're good at, and then propose that they work on certain tasks to play to their skills. You can even use flattery to draw them in, such as, ""You are so good at the details. Would you mind putting together the spreadsheet for this project, Jen?""

Ask questions and seek to understand.,
Provide updates regularly.,
Do what you say you're going to do.,
Find your niche.,
Be willing to do the dirty work.,
Don't criticize a method just to criticize it.",How to Work Well in a Team Environment2," It is important to ensure that you understand what the speaker is trying to express. One way to ensure that you are on the same page as someone else is to ask questions. This may help you to avoid conflicts due to misunderstandings.


You can use questions to help you understand something that a coworker has just said to you. For example, if your coworker has just explained a task to you, then you could say, ""So, I think you're saying _____. Is that right?"" If you are not on the same page, then your coworker can clarify his or her meaning for you.
You can also practice empathetic listening to maintain good work relationships with your coworkers, such as by echoing what the speaker says.For example, if a coworker says, ""I'm having a terrible day,"" then you might say, ""You're having a terrible day? What's going on?"" By asking a question, you are demonstrating to the speaker that you have heard him or her and that you would like to know more.

, Good communication is essential to working well in a team environment. You need to be able to talk about what you need from your coworkers, as well as discuss the progress of community projects regularly to figure out what you've accomplished already and what you still need to accomplish.You can't be passive-aggressive when working with others in a team environment. Passive-aggressiveness just leads to people being upset. Confront problems head-on as they arise in a professional manner.
For example, if you don't like the way something was done, the passive-aggressive response would be to make a slightly condescending comment or to go back and do it the way you wanted it in the first place. The professional approach would be to discuss why you think another way is better, and then defer to your peers if your idea is rejected., Reliability is one of the main components of being a good team member. If you don't follow through with your work, you're dragging the rest of the team down. Plus, you're team members won't trust you with any work in the future, and your performance could get back to your boss..

, Everyone has something to contribute to a team. You know what you're good at, and you can use that to make the team better. For instance, if you are good at organizing, offer to help oversee the paperwork for the project to help keep it on the right track., While you should play to your strengths, you're not always going to be given the prize jobs in group work. No matter what task you're working on together, everyone is going to need to do some of the grunt work. Be willing to dig in and do what needs to be done to finish the project., That is, if someone does something a way you wouldn't do it, analyze the situation before you jump in to ""fix"" it. You may realize that the method they are using is just as effective, even if it's not what you would do in the same situation."
"
Be respectful.,
Take the time you need.,
Realize it's always your job.,
Show enthusiasm.,
Take time to get to know each of your peers.,
Don't steal credit.",How to Work Well in a Team Environment3," Of course, you're not always going to like everyone you work with, and you certainly aren't required to like them. However, it is important to treat the people in your workplace with respect and professionalism. Throwing fits or getting in arguments with people you don't like is unprofessional and will slow down the team's work significantly., Sometimes, you may want to rush to get certain tasks done. However, in a team environment, that can lead to mistakes or an ineffective work process because you're not taking the time to work with other people or communicate what you're getting done. Make sure to spend the proper amount of time to do your work well while working with others at the same time., When you're not in a team environment, your job description may be fairly well defined. In a team environment, you may need to jump in to help in areas that aren't exactly in your job description because someone else needs the help. Being willing to help out makes the group work more efficiently and builds good will.In addition, jumping in when you see a need looks good to your boss, earning you brownie points, which is never a bad thing.
Also, you may find yourself needing help in the future, and if you've given help in the past, others will be more willing to offer you help when you need it.

, If you're excited, you'll get others excited. When you're working together, that excitement can lead to better results, as you're all motivated to do your best on the projects you're working on. On the other hand, if you constantly criticize or talk down about a project, that can be catching, too, and it can bring a project down.For example, don't start out the day by saying, ""I wish we didn't have to work through these ridiculous budget reports."" Instead, you could say, ""I know a budget report isn't everyone's cup of tea, but just think, going through these budget reports means we get the money we need to do the projects we love.""

, Remember that no two people are alike, and that each team player has strengths, weaknesses, likes, and dislikes. Knowing what makes your teammates tick is necessary to develop strong and productive working relationships, where you complement each other rather than work against each other.

Spend some time each day talking to your coworkers. Ask how they are and really listen to their answers. Let them talk about their home lives if they feel like talking about them.

, It can be tempting to take credit for other people's work. While it creates animosity no matter what environment you're in, it's especially detrimental in a team environment, as it can create major rifts. On the other hand, offering up who deserves credit for each part of the project goes a long way to building bridges.Offering up who deserves credit will make others feel appreciated, and feeling appreciated for hard work can help create the feeling of being on the same team.

Give your notice.,
Set down standard operating procedures.,
Arrange a space.,
Set a schedule.,
Acquaint yourself with your trainee.",How to Train Someone to Do Your Job1," Often, you will be training someone to do your job because you are moving into a new position within your organization. However, if you are leaving your current company, you need to give appropriate notice so that your employer know your position needs to be filled.Look at your employment agreement for any specific details regarding giving notice. Contracts or agreements may include language regarding how far in advance you give notice, and what medium is appropriate.
If your company does not have their own language regarding resignation, know that the standard is to give your employer two weeks notice before you leave, and that it’s appropriate to both meet with your supervisor to discuss your departure, as well as give them a written statement regarding your intent to leave the company.;
, Regardless of how well you train a new employee, they are not likely to remember everything from training. Develop a set of written procedures that detail step-by-step how to do your position. These procedures should include instructions on daily tasks, as well as how to conduct larger projects and processes in which you are involved.Ask your supervisor if there is a template for standard operating procedures in your company. Using a template will help keep things consistent for your trainee and make the writing process easier for you.
Begin by detailing your daily duties. Explain, step-by-step, what you do each day when you come in.
Once you have the daily routine established, detail larger processes and projects your trainee will be expected to pick up.
Map locations for anything stored digitally, and use charts and screenshots liberally so that the trainee can pair your instructions with helpful visual aids for each step.
Screenshots are especially helpful for anything you use that may be proprietary, such as databases, content management software, business to business software, or anything you would consider “in-house.”

, For a time, you and your trainee might be sharing a space. Make sure you and your trainee both have space to work without interfering with one another. If you are moving into a new position, you may want to ask if your new desk is ready while you are training your replacement.Make sure your trainee’s space is set up with what they need to fully perform their position. This includes getting them any permissions they may need for computer, software, and phone access, any keys they may need, or anything else pertinent to the specific position.

, Make sure you cover every topic important to your trainee by setting a schedule before you begin training. List every topic you want to cover with your trainee, and set aside the necessary block of time to make sure you can take them through the process.Remember to include time in each training block for your trainee to review the process and ask you questions.
Talk with your supervisor about their plans for the trainee to make sure your schedule fits theirs. If, for example, they plan on taking the trainee out to lunch one afternoon, make sure your training calendar is mindful of that time.
Have a flexible attitude when it comes to your training schedule. If something unexpected comes up in the course of your job, bring the trainee along even if the time was slotted for a different task. This allows them to see the position in action and start applying what they have already learned.

, If you did not hire your trainee, ask your supervisor or HR department to provide you with copies of their resume, cover letter, and any other material they may have submitted with their application. Familiarize yourself with their background and experience so that you can see where they might already have experience, and where they may need more training.Do not assume anything about your trainee. Their experience or background may be impressive, but they may not adapt quickly to the position.
Likewise, their experience may be different than what you would have considered for the position, but they may still be very capable and quick to learn.

Introduce yourself.,
Have a shadow period.,
Create assignments.,
Check in regularly.",How to Train Someone to Do Your Job2," Introduce yourself as a person, a co-worker, and a resource for your trainee. Give them more than just your name. Let them know a bit about your educational and professional background, and how long you have been in your current position. Give them a chance to relate to you so that they can also start relating to the position.


Let your trainee know that you will act as a resource for them as they figure out the job. You may want to say, “I helped develop this database, so if you have any questions even after training, you can always give me a call.”

, The first day or two with your trainee, allow them to get adjusted to the company and the job by watching you work. Let them shadow you, either for the entire day or for the parts of the day where you will be handling your trainee’s eventual job functions.Assist your trainee by offering to break down a process as you’re doing it or after you complete it.
Let your trainee go over their notes with you, and help them fill in blanks or parts that they have missed.

, Much of your time in training will be spent explaining concepts and taking your trainee through tasks and duties. You want to actively engage your trainee in the position, though. Create assignments for your trainee to help them work through their job duties and review with them so that they can see their strengths as well as where they need to improve.If, for example, you had a project that involved research and a summary of your findings, have your trainee repeat the research and the synthesis. Then, go over their work with them, paying equal attention to what they did well and what needs improvement.
If you have an active project, find a task within that for your trainee to try. This not only engages them actively with the position, but prepares them for what they will actually be working on moving forward.

, As training continues, you may be spending less time daily with your trainee. You still want to check in with your trainee on a daily basis, though. This lets them feel supported and allows them to work with you for as long as possible to learn the job.Try to set aside 15 minutes every morning to talk with your trainee about what they will be working on that day, and help them set goals for the day ahead.
Set aside another 15 to 30 minutes at the end of every day to talk with your trainee about what they accomplished and to answer any questions they may have.

"
"
Let your trainee take the lead.,
Build their relationships within the company.,
Stop working.,
Perform a final review.,
Leave the position.",How to Train Someone to Do Your Job3," As your trainee progresses in their training, allow them to take the lead on certain tasks and projects. Start by having them take care of the daily routine without your help. Then, when you feel comfortable with their ability to handle the day-to-day, allow them to take lead on a particular project or project component.


There is no set time frame for when any one trainee should be taking lead on anything. Look at what your training schedule will allow. If you have a few weeks to work with your trainee, you may want to focus the last week on getting them independent. If you only have a few days, this may need to happen faster.
Allowing them to take lead should mean that you are removing yourself from the process. Offer to assist your trainee if they want or need it, but otherwise leave it to them to perform the job functions.

, As you transition your position to your trainee, introduce them to other people who may be of help in completing their job. Look at those coworkers with whom you have worked in your position, and introduce your employee, explaining how, specifically, they may work with this person in the future.


Make sure your trainee has the phone numbers, email addresses and any other contact information they may need to get in touch with these new contacts on their own.
If possible, try to arrange coffee or lunch so that your trainee can really get to know the person and their job functions, rather than just stopping by their desk.

, At some point before your trainee is completely on their own, you should schedule to stop performing your current job functions. If you are able, you may want to turn your attention toward your new position. Let your trainee take over the position while you still have training time with them so you are there in case they need help.


Let your trainee know well in advance when you plan to have them fully assume the position. Explain to them, “I will be there if you need help or if something comes up that we haven’t covered yet, but otherwise you are going to be taking on the job completely.”
Let your supervisor know in advance, as well, and have them communicate with trainee first starting that day.

, At the end of the training period, do a final performance review with the trainee. This should primarily address their strength and growth, and place secondary emphasis on where they need to improve.Ask your supervisor if they would like to sit in on this process to offer their praise and constructive criticism, as well.
If you do talk to your trainee about areas where they may need to improve, do so through constructive criticism. Let them know that they are on the right track, and give them specific points of improvement on which to focus.
Talk to your trainee about where they can seek additional training if they feel there is any area they want to strengthen. Provide them with names and contact information of resources both internal and external to your company.

, Once the training period has ended, stop performing your old job duties. If you are able, allow your trainee to come to you with questions as they assume the position. Do not, however, have others within your organization demand you perform functions that should be done by your trainee.If you move to a different position in your current organization, talk to your new supervisor and let them know that you are being asked to perform tasks from your old position. See if they can speak with your old manager about transitioning responsibilities to your trainee.
If you are leaving your organization, you are likely under no obligation to continue performing work them. Simply let your former employer know that while you appreciated your time with their company, you are not in a place to complete those job functions anymore.

Alter your reaction.,
Avoid your coworker.,
Get to the point.,
Keep things to yourself.,
Consider why your coworker annoys you.,
Put up with your coworker.,
Change the subject.,
Learn to say no.",How to Tolerate a Coworker You Cannot Stand1," When someone is annoying you it can be easy to respond emotionally, without thinking. Getting emotional about a coworker’s behaviour isn’t going to help the situation get any better. In fact, there’s a good chance that an emotional reaction will make the situation worse. The only person you have control over is you, so learn to control your reactions.When your coworker does something annoying, give yourself a moment to look at how you react. How do you feel? What’s going through your mind? What do you do, if anything? What specific event triggered this reaction?
Once you’ve had a chance to think about how YOU respond to your coworker, think about whether that reaction is worth it. You likely have to spend a lot of energy to get upset — is your coworker worth that added stress? Not likely.
Develop a system for altering your reactions to your coworker. Maybe you need to take a minute and breathe deeply, or count to 10. Maybe you just need to close your eyes and visualize your ‘happy place.’
The next time your coworker does something annoying, use the system you developed. Over time your system will become easier to use, and will soon become your instinctual reaction.;
, Sometimes you have to work near someone who annoys you, but you don’t have to work with that person. Maybe they sit at a desk near you, but they aren’t in the same department. Or maybe you pass them by now and again in the hallway, but you never see them otherwise. Instead of expending the energy and effort to tolerate or deal with this coworker, avoid them., Some annoying people become more annoying the longer you have to interact with them. Keep your interactions with these people as short as possible. Don’t bother with nice conversation starters or questions about their weekend, just get to the point. Once the (short) interaction is complete, allow your coworker the chance to have the last word, then walk away. Don’t drag the interaction out longer than needed, and don’t allow your coworker to monopolize your time., Gossiping at work happens a lot. You’ve probably gossiped about someone else, and your coworkers have probably gossiped about you. Some gossip is harmless (e.g. why can’t they get that elevator to work property), but other gossip can be quite upsetting (e.g. Susan slept with the boss). Some of the most hurtful gossip is when someone speaks negatively about a coworker. You most likely never want to be the one your coworkers are gossiping about, so don’t gossip about them.‘Ranting’ to someone about the problems and issues you’re having at work is important, as it relieves stress and makes you feel better. If you feel the need to talk about a coworker’s behaviour, talk to someone who doesn’t work with you.

, No one wants to think THEY may be the problem, and not someone else, but it is a possibility. Is it possible that your coworkers annoy you for reasons that are beyond their control? For example, are you jealous that they have a better job, get paid more, or get to sit near the window? Is it possible you’re interpreting your unhappiness about a specific situation as dislike or annoyance?, Tolerating means you realize your coworker does something annoying, but you’re not going to care. Not caring means you ignore your coworker’s behaviour, or it means you don’t allow yourself to react to the behaviour anymore. Instead, you accept the behaviour for what it is and move on.This type of response is easier said than done because you really do have to move on and let go. You can’t push your frustration about the behaviour to the back of your mind and try to pretend it doesn’t exist. Doing this will only make you feel worse in the long run.

, There is no requirement that you have to talk about your personal life when you’re at work. Yet you probably have one or more coworkers who like to pry anyway. These coworkers may also be the type who want to provide you with advice and suggestions on everything from your hair, to how to parent your children, to where you should go on vacation. The best approach with this type of coworker is to simply change the subject., Some coworkers will ask if you need help with a task because they’re genuinely nice people and want to be helpful. Other coworkers may ask if you need help with a task because it’ll make them look good, or you’ll owe them a favour at some point in the future. They’re not asking because they’re being nice, they’re asking because they have a plan. In situations like this you need to learn to just say no. In the long run, the type of help these coworkers are offering is no the kind of help you need."

Confront your coworker.,
Play to your coworker’s ego.,
Identify your coworker’s lack of knowledge.,
Allow your coworker to cool down.,
Set expectations.,
Help your coworker make a decision.,
Identify the positive.,
Ask open-ended questions.",How to Tolerate a Coworker You Cannot Stand2," If your coworker is constantly putting you down or trying to humiliate you, chances are untrue statements and wild excuses are being used. Instead of ignoring your coworker, confront your coworker. Force your coworker to explain the reasoning behind the statements being made. Your coworker is most likely unable to explain the reasons as there is no logic or truth behind those statements. Your coworker will soon realize picking on you isn’t worth the effort., Some of your coworkers will be smarter than you, and they know it. Unfortunately they may also take every opportunity to make sure you realize it too. Coworkers like this are unlikely to agree with ideas you come up with, because the idea didn’t originate with them. Instead of expressing an idea you know won’t be agreed to, explain the idea in the form of one or more questions. Ask how your coworker would approach the problem. Let your coworker explain an idea that would solve the problem. Low and behold, your coworker will present an idea that actually came from you without even knowing it., You most likely have coworkers who are not smarter than you, but who think they are smarter than you. These coworkers normally have nothing useful to contribute and reduce overall productivity with bad decisions. When you need to work with someone like this, behave nicely enough that your coworker thinks you’re cooperative, but then ask questions that highlight the holes in your coworker’s logic.The key is to do this subtly so it doesn’t appear as though you are vengeful or mean. The purpose here is not to humiliate your coworker, but rather to help you coworker understand you see through the deception.

, Coworkers with tempers who scream and shout are impossible to deal with when angry, so it is better not to try. Instead, walk away. On the one hand you do not deserve to be treated that way, and on the other hand nothing useful is going to result from any remaining interaction. Approach your coworker again after a cooling off period and complete the interaction.Keep in mind, especially if this type of reaction is unusual for your coworker, that there may be a personal problem causing this behaviour. Providing your coworker with the opportunity to cool off also helps your coworker save face by not saying something that may be regretted later.

, Some coworkers try very hard to please everyone by saying ‘yes’ to everything. These coworkers don’t understand the limits of their abilities (or they understand their limits and are afraid to admit them). They may also come across as extremely nice and helpful, but if you think about it you will soon realize they never actually accomplished anything. These coworkers need constant approval and are get upset when someone doesn’t like them. They need a comfortable and open work environment in order to open up and be honest.When trying to get a commitment from a coworker like this, be explicit. Work together to develop a detailed plan which is written down. Develop a specific timeline which is agreed upon. Follow-up with a confirmation email. And most importantly, outline the consequences of what may happen if the timeline is not met.

, Some annoying coworkers are annoying because they couldn’t make a decision to save their lives. They go back and forth between options endlessly until it’s too late. When dealing with coworkers like this, the best option is to gently push them towards a specific option and reaffirm that they’re decision is a good one. These coworkers likely can’t make a decision because they lack confidence, so give them that confidence.You can lead a coworker like this towards a specific outcome in one of two ways:

You can explain all possible options (including all pros and cons) and wait to see which option appeals most to your coworker. Once you know which option is preferred, use your influence to build your coworkers confidence towards that specific option.
You can explain all possible options (including all pros and cons) but include an opinion as to which option you believe is the best. You can then provide additional evidence as to why you believe that option is the best and help influence you coworker to select that option.



, Negative coworkers can be very depressing to work with, and can bring a whole team or department down with them. No amount of logic or rationalization is going to make these coworkers see the positive in any situation. Instead of arguing with these coworkers, agree with them. When they point out some negative aspects, point out some additional negative aspects. Eventually you’ll have pointed out so many negatives that the only other options available are positives. Consider this the reverse psychology method., Certain coworkers seem as of they have no emotions, and their body language is so silent you have no idea what they’re thinking. Sometimes coworkers in this category also tend to say very little when asked a question or opinion, which can be a problem if you need that answer or decision in order to do your work. Approach these types of coworkers with only open-ended questions. Do not ask them any questions that will only require a yes or no answer."

Do some research.If higher-ups in your organization will be present at the holiday party, you should browse your company’s website to ensure you know their names and role in the company.,

Schedule your arrival and departure carefully.,
Network with others.,
Don’t engage in serious work-related talk.,
Make conversation with others.You can survive a holiday party by talking to other party-goers, especially others who are also trying to survive the holiday office party.,
Always say goodbye.Before departing, you should let people – both your coworkers and superiors – that you are heading out.",How to Survive a Holiday Office Party1," You don’t want any of them to feel slighted that you brushed by them without paying proper respects., If you have a friend or partner willing to tag along, you might have a better time at the holiday office partner than you otherwise would. Be sure to check with your boss before bringing a guest, though – some holidays office parties are intended for employees only., Arriving late and leaving early means you’ll spend less time at the holiday office party. If anyone asks why you arrived late, explain, “I was stuck in traffic.” If anyone asks why you’re leaving early, explain, “I need to let my pet out.”If alcohol is served at the holiday office party, arriving first could communicate that you’re too eager to start drinking. Even if alcohol is not available at the holiday office party, arriving first might create the impression that you’re not busy at work.
Leaving last indicates that you don’t know when to stop partying. Do not be the last to leave., If the holiday party introduces you to others in your department, or even others in neighboring departments, you should use the chance to talk to them.Not only is a great way to meet new friends, but you can also use the holiday party to forge alliances within your company. Entertain their ideas and impress them by offering your own.Later, when the party concludes, you can use these professional networks to exert influence in your company and enlist others to your cause.
If these people move on to other firms, they might remember you and encourage their new employers to offer you a job.
Follow up with the people you networked with. Add them on social media and stay in touch.

, Don’t use the holiday office party as an opportunity to corner your superior to talk about a raise or promotion. Those matters are best left to regular business hours., You can talk to them about work. How does your work differ from theirs? How is it similar? Alternately, you could talk to them about some unrelated topic like music or art.Always keep the conversation light. Talk about your family, but only in affectionate terms. Never disparage your boss or family in conversation during a holiday office party. Avoid conversation about politics, religion, and personal problems.
Your conversations should last around 5-10 minutes.That way, you won’t dominate the other person’s time, and they won’t dominate yours.
When your conversation partner is talking, nod silently to show interest and agreement with what they said.
Do not make an interjection like, “I know what you mean!” While well-intentioned, it might throw off their rhythm.

, They might feel snubbed if you don’t. Be sure to thank whoever organized the holiday office party before leaving."

Overcome your anxiety.,
Get some fresh air.,
Stay off your phone.,
Have fun.",How to Survive a Holiday Office Party2," If you’re not naturally outgoing or a great conversationalist, surviving the holiday office party might seem hard. One way to overcome this anxiety is to do something nice for someone. When you’re talking with someone and you come to an awkward lull in the conversation, ask, “Can I get you a drink?”Equip yourself for conversation by having some conversation starters ready to deploy. For instance, you might say, “So, which division of the company are you in?” Follow up by asking, “Oh, is it interesting? How long have you been there?”Locate extroverted conversation partners so that they do all the work for you.Shake hands firmly and use a bright smile when meeting new people., If you feel stifled or exhausted after too much holiday office party stimulation, head out to your car or just step outside for a minute or two. This should give you time to “recharge” for another round of holiday office party interactions., If you’re on your phone, you might come off as disinterested and miss opportunities for socialization. Put a wine glass or a plate of hors d’oeuvres in your hands instead., The best part of the holiday office party is having fun with people you only get to see on a professional basis. Have a few drinks and relax. Tell a joke to your coworker and laugh you’re your coworker shares their funny jokes.Be warm and personable at your holiday office party.

Demonstrate humility during toasts.,
Don’t drink too much.If alcohol is served at the holiday office party, drink in moderation, if you choose to drink at all.,
Don’t assume everyone shares your holiday.,
Use social media carefully.",How to Survive a Holiday Office Party3," Dressing inappropriately could negatively impact your coworkers’ assessment of you, and lead to embarrassment. Ask your superior if there is a dress code and dress appropriately. No matter what you wear, remember, the holiday office party is a business event and your manner of dress should be relatively conservative., A holiday office party has an informal atmosphere, but it is still on company property and your relationship with your coworkers does not end when you have a party. Inappropriate comments or actions could result in a reprimand from your company’s HR division.Don’t tell off-color jokes.
Don’t dance romantically with a fellow employee. This might be unwanted, and could lead to office gossip.
Kissing or hugging your coworkers, likewise, is inappropriate.
Do not play inappropriate party games, even if they are available.Do not comment on your coworkers’ appearance.

, If you’ve done exceptionally well at your firm, you might be recognized by your superiors with a toast. Show your appreciation for their acknowledgment and thank them cordially. Do not drink to yourself – this indicates bad manners.If you’re not the subject of a toast yourself, consider toasting a coworker or manager – but only if you have something sincere to say., Otherwise, you might become the subject of office gossip. Eat a light dinner or have some snacks while you’re at the party so you’re not drinking on an empty stomach.Drinking in front of coworkers is okay, but eating in front of them can be awkward. If the party overlaps with dinner time, you should eat dinner before arriving.Stop drinking about one hour before you intend to leave. If necessary, call a cab or get a ride from a friend.Even if you did drink too much, go to work the next day anyways. It will reduce the quantity of gossip being spread about your bad behavior.Don’t eat too many snacks or hors d’oeuvres, either., December is a month in which many seasonal holidays occur. For instance, Christmas, Kwanzaa, and Hanukkah are some of the holidays that occur toward the end of the year. Instead of wishing someone a “Happy Kwanzaa” as you depart, say to coworkers, “Happy Holidays.”If you know which holiday the person you’re bidding farewell to celebrates, bid them farewell using a reference to the appropriate holiday., If you post images from the holiday office party on social media, only express positive or neutral thoughts. Never post negative content that could hurt your relationships with coworkers or insult your superiors. For instance, do not go home and write, “The holiday party was very boring and dumb” on your social media account.Always ask the people in the pictures if it’s okay for you to post them before doing so.

Set your goals.,
Determine an action plan.,
Follow through on your action plan.",How to Survive a Holiday Office Party4," Identifying the fact that you want to survive your holiday office party is a great start. But you should also identify why you want to survive it, and define what survival means. How will it make you feel? What will it accomplish?For instance, you might say, “I want to survive my holiday office party because it will help me get to know my coworkers better.”
You might say, “Surviving the holiday office party means that I will meet three new people who work for my company.”, Once you’ve identified your goals, figure out how you can accomplish them. What sorts of criteria define surviving your holiday office party? For instance, surviving the office party might mean avoiding that manager who always gives you a hard time. It might mean having a great conversation with your coworkers., In order to survive the holiday office party, put the strategies you identified into action. This will lead to a positive outcome that meets your goals and expectations. For instance, if you decided that the best way to survive the holiday office party was to have a great conversation with your coworker, strike up a conversation with them and chat away."

Seek additional training.,
Increase your knowledge.,
Share your successes.,
Speak your mind.,
Be the change you’d like to see.",How to Stop Feeling Less Clever Than Your Colleagues1," Probably the most tried-and-true method for increasing one’s cleverness is to seek additional training. Is there a new skill that would aid in your job performance? Seek out additional training outside of work. This will lead you to perform better at your job, feel better about yourself, and to be seen as a clever over-achiever.There may be some way for your employer to pay for this training.
In some cases, additional certifications may lead to a raise or even a promotion.;
, Much like gaining additional training, increasing your knowledge can boost your cleverness at work. Are there any books that might help you be a more efficient worker? Is there a skill you could teach yourself that might make your work day go smoother? Spend some time at home increasing your knowledge, and before long you will see positive results at work., At first it may seem strange, or even impolite, to lead with your accomplishments. However, being able to put your success on display at work will only lead to improved inner-confidence and improved outer-image! Don’t be shy. Don't be afraid that you are bragging. Simply share what you have earned, honestly and directly.Place awards or diplomas on display.
If your work sends out a newsletter with personal updates, use that channel to share any big success stories.
Simply let the people you work with know. State, for example, “I’m really pleased that my paper was accepted for publication. This is wonderful for me.”

, Whenever you are feeling less clever, you will be more likely to second guess yourself and stifle your input. Do you best to put this aside! Share your thoughts and opinions as soon as they come to you (before your doubt has the opportunity to stomp them). Hurry up and press send on that email, or raise your hand and share your thoughts in a meeting. You will feel better and be seen as an assertive go-getter., If you want other people to see you as a competent peer and treat you with respect, you must do two things: you must treat others this way, and you must treat yourself this way. In short, you must be a representative of the type of work environment you’d like to see.

Treating others with respect may be more natural that treating yourself with respect. Begin respecting yourself by watching the way you talk about yourself. Don't say anything about yourself that you would not say about a colleague or friend.

"
Be aware of the exceptions.,
Be discreet.,
Approach those who won't mind being asked.,
Ask people who are leaving the company.",How to Talk with Coworkers About Your Salaries1," Before you ever start discussing salary, you should realize there are some exceptions to the law about discussing salaries. Government workers, independent contractors, and supervisors are all not covered by this law, meaning they aren't protected from being fired if they discuss salaries.You do have the right to discuss salary at work, as well, but only if your workplace allows other non-work related discussion. They can only forbid salary discussion at work if they forbid all non-work related conversation.;
, While you can be as overt discussing salaries as you want, many companies frown upon the activity. Therefore, it may be to your benefit to make inquiries as quietly as you can.One way to make it easier is to discuss it when you're not at work. You could have lunch with a coworker, for instance, and bring up the topic of salary, or you could have a drink after work sometime., Some people are extra touchy about money, and it's probably not a good idea to approach them at all. Generally, it's the same people who don't overshare in general. Plus, you should know the person well enough to be able to decide if they will be touchy on the subject before you ask them., Once someone is leaving, they are less likely to be secretive about their salary. Therefore, it's a good time to ask them what they make, as they'll be more willing to share."
,How to Give Notice2,
"
Review your contract / offer letter.,
Speak to your supervisor in person.,
Explain your reason for leaving the position.,
Ask your supervisor about expectations prior to your departure.,
Consider also putting your notice in writing.,
Tell your boss well in advance of when you plan to leave.,
Thank your supervisor.,
Be prepared to leave immediately.",How to Give Notice3," Before you leave, make an effort to re-read any contracts and/or offer letters you signed upon your initial hiring. These will often contain specific rules about what to do when you want to leave your job. Often, these will be no more complicated than something along the lines of: ""this employment may be terminated by either party, at any time, and for any reason."" However, if your employer has specified certain rules for your departure, you'll definitely want to know them beforehand to ensure that you don't breach the terms of your employment.


If you don't still have these documents handy, don't panic. Your employer should have copies of these documents - talk to your Human Resources department, your supervisor, or another similar person in charge of record-keeping at your workplace to request these.

, Treat your supervisor with respect (even if you don't think s/he deserves it.) Taking the time to speak to your supervisor in person will demonstrate your respect for him or her as well as for your position. A face-to-face conversation is far, far, more respectful than a notice sent via email or voice mail, so if you want a good recommendation from your employer, it's preferable.


Play the game. Not every job is a dream job. Still, even if you hated this job, at the very least, you should pretend that you enjoyed your work when you're giving your notice. Don't give in to the temptation to insult your supervisor or your job - the short-term satisfaction you get from rubbing it in your boss's face isn't worth the difficulty you'll experience in the future when trying to explain why you can't provide a reference for this position.

, Though you almost never will technically need to specify a reason for leaving, having one ready will make your farewell conversation with your boss (and, later, with your fellow employees) much easier. There are a variety of reasons for leaving: you may have found a position more suited to your life goals, you may be moving away, or you may have have decided to stop working due to ill health. Only you will know the exact reason for why you're leaving.


If you are leaving because you are unhappy with the job, rather than stating this bluntly, you might instead say that ""this position is not a good fit"" to spare the feelings of your supervisor and coworkers. Whenever possible, avoid burning bridges with remarks like this.

, Before leaving, you may be asked to complete specific projects, train a co-worker to do your work or assist in finding a replacement. Approach these tasks honorably and politely. Don't be reluctant to perform work now that you know you're leaving - if you make the transition process difficult for your employer, it may result in a less-than-perfect reference in the future.

, For some positions in which all communication is typically carried out via phone or email, like, for instance, telecommuting jobs, it's impossible or impractical to meet with your employer in person. In other positions, employers may require a written notice for their files in addition to a verbal communication. In these cases, write a formal, dignified letter of resignation and present it to your employer (or, if you can't give it in person, mail/email it.)


In your letter, express your regret at having to leave, explain your reasons for leaving, and specify that you will be available to help find and/or train your replacement. Keep your tone curt and corporate - don't waste space on flowery, overly-emotional goodbyes. You can express your innermost emotions in personal conversations and correspondences with your coworkers.

, If it can be avoided, never surprise your boss with the news that you're quitting. Besides being just plain rude, it's problematic both for your employer and for your future job projects. On the one hand, your employer may be forced to scramble to find a replacement for you - if s/he can't, s/he may have to scale back operations or even close the business temporarily. Even if you hate your boss, this is an unfair, dishonest thing to do. Even worse, it's something that can negatively affect your fellow coworkers (if they're forced to pick up your slack).


Additionally, if you surprise your boss with news of your departure, you can be practically sure that s/he will be discouraged from giving you a good recommendation, which can hamper your job searches in the future.
Your employment contract may specify a minimum time for giving advance notice. If not, two weeks is the traditional amount of time you should plan to work between giving your notice and leaving your job.
Note: It's a good idea to make sure your boss is the first person who knows you're planning on leaving. In other words, don't tell your coworkers before you tell your boss, even if they happen to be close friends. Word travels fast in the workplace - it's awfully embarrassing to have your boss approach you about your plans to leave, rather than the reverse.

, If the job has been a pleasant experience, this should come naturally. If not, however, you should definitely ""fake it."" Thanking your employer creates a feeling of goodwill with your soon-to-be-ex supervisor.


At this point, it's appropriate to ask for your employer for a positive letter of recommendation or to serve as an employment reference in the future. However, realize that your employer isn't obligated to perform these tasks.
When asking for a letter of recommendation or reference, be sure to specify that you're looking for a positive one - if not, disingenuous employers may give potential future employers less-than-stellar comments. No recommendation is usually better than a negative recommendation.

, Understand that, though you have given your notice in advance of when you plan to leave, your employer may plan to dismiss you sooner, or even immediately. This isn't necessarily a sign of disapproval - they may not have any more work for you to do, or they may just want to avoid having you around to demoralize other employees. In any case, try to ""wrap things up"" before you make your announcements. Finish any outstanding projects and have your possessions at least somewhat in order ahead of time to avoid a messy, protracted exit.


If you're dismissed early, check your contract - you may be entitled to severance pay for the time you would have worked.

Check your rental agreement.,
Send a written notice to your landlord.,
Talk to or call your landlord to discuss departure requirements.,
Assure your landlord that you will clean the property before departure.,
Schedule a walk-through inspection.,
Make arrangements to collect your security deposit.",How to Give Notice4," In many places, including the State of California, you must give the landlord the same amount of notice as there are days between rent payments.Check your lease for the notice requirement - this document will probably also contain instructions and rules for announcing your departure. Understand these rules before you give your notice, as they will help inform your decision. For instance, if you are on a fixed-term lease, by moving out early, you may be breaking the terms of the lease, and thus may be held responsible for future rent, advertising costs, etc.

, Unlike giving notice to an employer, giving notice to a landlord usually requires some sort of written notification. In this letter, you will want to include important information in the notice, such as the name of everyone who is vacating the property, the address of the property you are vacating, the address of the property you'll be moving to, and the date you intend to leave.


The tone of your letter should serious and formal, with an eye for proper spelling and grammar.

, If you can, it's a very good idea to speak with (or, at the very least, strike up an email conversation with) your landlord so that you can go over the arrangements you'll need to make to move out. S/he may require that you drop off the key at a specific location on your last day. S/he may also want the house completely clean by a certain date, even if you're not required to move out until later. It's best not to guess about these things, so talk to your landlord as soon as you can.

, When you contact your landlord, mention that you'll be able to turn the property over in clean (if not perfect) condition. Delivering the property in good, clean condition will increase your chances of receiving back all or most of your security deposit.

, Many landlords will require an in-person inspection (that you'll need to be present for) before you hand the keys over. This is in the interest of both parties. Your landlord wants to make an honest assessment of the condition of the property so s/he will be able to take money out of the security deposit for repairs, etc. You, on the other hand, want to be there so that your landlord can't make false statements about the condition of the property to cheat you out of your deposit. When you talk to your landlord, be sure to ask him or her when they plan to inspect the property so that you can arrange to be there as well.

, Usually, when you rent a property, you pay a substantial deposit up-front (traditionally, one month's rent). When you move out, you are given this deposit back, minus the cost of any repairs the landlord needed to make do to damage on your part, etc. Assuming you've treated the property with care, you should get back most, if not all, of your initial deposit.


Be up-front with your landlord about the fact that you'll want your deposit back after you've moved out and any needed repairs are paid for. Don't leave this unsaid - while most landlords are honest people and will plan on giving you back your deposit, on the off chance you do have a dishonest landlord, you may need to bring this up yourself.
Don't let a landlord evade your questioning. Be persistent - don't let a fear of awkward conversation allow a landlord to slink away with your hard-earned deposit money.

Sit comfortably and erect in your desk chair or in your car (before entering the workplace). Place a hand on your chest and the other on your stomach. Take a deep, cleansing breath in. Notice your stomach expanding (your chest should only move a little). Hold the breath for a few counts and then let the breath out and pay attention to your stomach deflating beneath your hand.Repeat this exercise several times for a relaxing calm in the workplace, or wherever you need it.;
, That annoying coworker can seem a lot more annoying if you aren't getting any breaks away from him. Make sure you take advantage of every break opportunity you have to get away from the office, or at least get the opportunity to rest and recharge. Even small breaks - think 2 minutes every hour - can have a huge impact on your well-being.Phone a friend who does not work with you and chat for a few minutes. Grab your cell and play a round or two of Candy Crush Saga. Or, simply drop your head and take a quick doze (if that's approved at your office).
If you had more break time, maybe you wouldn't be so sensitive to minor annoyances from your coworkers.

, Do you have a coworker who has a cringe-worthy laugh, or worse, one that snorts? Bring a pair of headphones along to work and create a playlist that tunes out your obnoxious coworker. Research shows that just about any songs are effective at boosting productivity for repetitive, monotonous work. However, songs that incorporate sounds from nature are especially helpful at more creative or demanding tasks. Just be sure to pump your music at a moderate level as high volume music can actually be distracting., It can be tempting to divulge all you wish you could do to that awful coworker over lunch or at the water cooler with some of your friends at the office. Don't give in to the temptation. It's simply more professional to talk about the coworker who is annoying you to an impartial listener., If you often find yourself irritated throughout the day because your coworker turned in documents with coffee stains or totally ignored the firm deadline for her paperwork, give yourself reminders to stay cool. Add a post-it to your desktop that reminds that ""this, too, shall pass"" or download a wallpaper that says ""keep calm and carry on"". Just seeing such helpful reminders can keep you focused on the tasks at hand, and not lose minutes or hours of your productivity fuming about what your coworker did.

, Rather than reacting to your fellow staff member when he tells an inappropriate joke, repeat your anchor word like a mantra: ""compassion, compassion, compassion"" or ""calm, calm, calm"". Do this until the urge to react dissipates.

, A change in environment a few cubicles over might be all you need to return your work life to state of balance.

, You simply can't take on every single issue that comes up in relation to the obnoxious person(s) at your work. If you are constantly whining to your supervisor or the person in the cubicle next to you, eventually no one will want to hear what you have to say. Ask yourself if every issue is worth discussing or making a comment on.


If the issue is not detrimental to your well-being or the well-being of the company, pass on it. Also, if you decide to speak up about it, be sure you have a recommended solution and aren't just pointing out the problem., If and when you do decide to speak to this person about their behavior or habits, do so in private. Pull the person aside and ask if you can have a moment of his time. Calmly state the issue, using ""I"" statements, and conclude with a possible solution to the problem.


For example, say ""I am frequently distracted from my work by your snickering. I know you probably don't even know it's distracting, so I was wondering if we could try to have me signal you when you're doing it and then you can either go in the break-room or outside when we're joking around.""
Addressing the issue in this way allows you to take ownership for your feelings and minimizes the likelihood of your coworker getting angry or offended., It can seem straight-up mean to ask a coworker to stop doing something just because we don't like the behavior. Lean on your work as a crutch in such situations. Say to the obnoxious person, ""Hey, X, I am really in a crunch on this project and your music is making it hard for me to focus. Could you please turn it down/off?"" You are there to work, after all.

, In the next office meeting, raise your hand and offer up a suggestion that can improve everyone's productivity in the office (and get rid of the problem behavior).


Suggestions might include: everyone bringing headphones if they want to listen to music, being mindful of gender, cultural, racial, or other differences when telling jokes, restricting non-work related conversations to the break room, etc.

, Ask your boss for a bit of time, and discuss the problem you're encountering with your coworker if the problem continually get worse. It is also important to have a record of your complaint, particularly if your obnoxious coworker is doing something against company regulations, such as harassing you or others.

, This may seem counter-intuitive to what you want to do, but strive to listen to the annoying person. Frequently, when we find another person obnoxious, we have the tendency to discount what he or she says. Face it, we all have some annoying qualities. Those qualities shouldn't, however, negate our strengths in other areas of life. Challenge yourself to really listen to your coworker and get his or her perspective.

, As one quote puts it, ""there isn't a person you wouldn't love, if you knew their story"". Make the decision to learn more about the coworker that has been getting under your skin.


Ask the person out for coffee, lunch, or after-work cocktails, depending on how appropriate that is. Tell him/her that work is off the table for conversation and that you have been wanting to get to know him. Ask about your coworker's family, hobbies, and/or childhood. Talking to this person about non-work stuff could actually make him more interesting (and less annoying), since you have only ever know him through one context.

, Sometimes, we see bad traits in others more clearly because we share the same traits. There's a possibility that your coworker gets under your skin because he or she is doing something that you also do. Perhaps this is a trait that you have been picked on about, or others have gotten on your case about in the past. Are you being fair to this person or are you projecting a dislike you have about yourself onto him?


Research has shown that when we believe we have a negative trait we are more likely to identify this same trait in others.You could be annoyed by your coworker simply because the person is doing the same annoying thing you do.

, Aim to focus on bettering yourself rather than nitpicking about every single irritating thing your coworker does. If this person often interrupts others' conversations, model respectfulness by using the appropriate manners in conversation. Maybe your good behaviors will rub off on your coworker.


You can also set an example for other coworkers who often nag or complain about your coworker being obnoxious. Demonstrate respect for all your coworkers, and others may follow suit.

Assess your competencies.,
Shape your environment.,
Fake it ‘til you make it.,
Practice a positive attitude.,
Do something useful.",How to Stop Feeling Less Clever Than Your Colleagues2," Chances are, you are good at something. You must have been good enough at what you do to land this job and to hold onto it. Don’t allow negative self-perceptions to rule you. Instead, build up the positive aspects of your work performance. Start by creating a list of everything you are good at doing, ranging from very simple to extremely complex. Anytime you start to feel like you are not clever enough, return to this list and remember that you are., Your physical environment at work can have a huge effect on your mood, contributing to either a positive or negative self-image. Give yourself a boost by creating an upbeat environment. Decorate your desk with bright colors, positive statements, and images that make you happy. If it is allowed, you may also want to invest in an essential oil diffuser and freshen your air with lavender or citrus oils (both proven to reduce stress and improve your mood)., Confidence is governed by hormones in your brain. When you feel confident, your brain releases a series of hormones. But researchers have concluded that even when you fake feeling confident, the same hormones are released. In other words, if you fake being self-confident at work, you will quickly become it!Envision your most confident self. How do you comport yourself? How do you move through the office? How do you dress?
Put that vision into action! Even if you don't feel confident on the inside, perform confidence outwardly.

, Having a optimistic and upbeat attitude toward life is a conscious choice that requires practice. When you are faced with a challenge or a stressful situation, you can choose how you will handle it. If you can manage to cultivate a positive outlook during stressful times, not only will you begin to feel more clever, but others will be drawn to you.Anytime you are faced with a challenging or stressful situation, stop and take a moment to breathe. Check in with your emotional response. Are you angry. frustrated, nervous, or anxious?
Remember that those emotions do not serve you. Is there a way for you to approach this problem calmly, with compassion, understanding, and grace?
In time, your natural responses will become more positive.

, In general, when we are a caught dwelling on our lack of cleverness or poor intellect, it means that, perhaps, we are spending a bit too much time focusing on ourselves. Get out of the rut by shifting your focus onto doing something useful. What needs to be done at your work? How can you be of service? Completing such a task (even a small one) is sure to give your mood a boost, and as an added benefit, it will certify that you are a vital and necessary component of your workplace.If an opportunity to volunteer presents itself (such as becoming the safety coordinator for your office), go for it.
You may even consider asking for more responsibility at work.

Recognize that it exists.,
Forget about luck.,
Ban “undercutting” words.,
Cease comparing yourself to others.,
Let your ambition lead.",How to Stop Feeling Less Clever Than Your Colleagues3," Pauline Clance and Suzanne Imes coined the term “impostor syndrome” to describe feelings of “phoniness in people who believe that they are not intelligent, capable or creative despite evidence of high achievement.” If you worry that you are less clever than your colleagues, it is likely that you are afflicted. The first step in overcoming impostor syndrome is to acknowledge it, and to understand that many, many people experience these feelings., The funny thing about impostor syndrome is that it leads you to ignore or discount proof that you are qualified. In order to counter this, try to embrace your successes. Don’t attribute your accomplishments to “getting lucky.” It wasn’t luck; you worked hard to get where you are and you deserve it., Words like “merely,” “just,” “only,” or “simply” work to undermine your achievements and minimize your contributions, giving your impostor syndrome fuel. Work to ban these words from your vocabulary! Edit your email correspondences to remove these words and work to strike them from your vernacular at work., Often times, impostor syndrome rears its ugly head when we begin looking at the successes (or even the shortcomings) of others. Anytime you find yourself sizing yourself up in the relationship to other people, practice stopping dead in your tracks. Remind yourself that the only useful yardstick is one that measures you against yourself., Fear and self-doubt can get in the way of your achievement, but studies have shown that people who suffer from impostor syndrome tend to be very ambitious. Let your desire for success sit in the drivers seat. Take the leap, even if you are terrified to do so. You may always have bouts of self-doubt, but at least this way you’ll also have bouts of professional success."

Ask if they mind discussing salary.,
Tell them why you want to know.,
Pass around a spreadsheet to disclose salaries.,
Don't push.",How to Talk with Coworkers About Your Salaries2," The first step is just to broach the topic with the person. Obviously, you don't want to just demand to know their salary. Broach the topic more gently.You could say, ""I'm trying to informally gather some information on salaries in the company, and I was wondering if you'd be willing to share yours.""

, You may be able to convince people if you have an explicit reason for asking about salary. For instance, maybe you suspect you aren't making enough, or you maybe you think the company is discriminating against women and/or people of color.You could tell them, ""I think I'm being underpaid for my work, and I'm wondering if it's systematic. I'd like to see how women are being paid in comparison to men in the company.""
You could also offer to tell them your salary: ""As a gesture of goodwill, I don't mind telling you my salary if you want to know.""

, Another option is to do the work semi-anonymously. For instance, you could make a spreadsheet that you pass around to coworkers with different people adding their information. With this method, disclosing salaries could be done somewhat anonymously, as employees would not need to give their names.However, in a small company, it would be difficult to keep people anonymous. Nonetheless, a spreadsheet you pass around is a good way to collect the information for everyone.

, If someone doesn't want to share their information, you should let it go. Pushing someone to share will only cause more tension, and they are more likely to report you to management.

Be ready for jealousy.,
Understand it may not remain a secret.,
Expect some retribution.",How to Talk with Coworkers About Your Salaries3," Sometimes, sharing salary information can lead to jealousy in the workplace. A coworker might get jealous of what you make, leading to tension. On the other hand, knowing salaries provides a reference for asking for a raise, so it can go either way.For instance, you can say you've gathered information on salary in your company, and you know you're being underpaid. Even if you don't tell your boss that, you at least know you're being underpaid and have cause to ask for a raise.

, If you tell someone your salary, that information is out there. That means it can be told to everyone in the office. If you're not ready for the whole office to know, then you shouldn't tell your salary., While it's technically illegal for management to take any action against you (including firing you), that doesn't mean they can't make life difficult for you in subtle ways. If management doesn't like what you're doing, they may snub you in ways that you can't prove are connected to the salary discussions.If you can prove that you are being discriminated against, you do have protection under the law. The key is to document everything you can, and take it to a lawyer.

Reflect upon your strengths and challenges.,
Understand your new responsibilities.,
Set priorities for your new role.,
Use a planner and stay organized.,
Be confident.,
Manage work stress.",How to Handle Anxiety About a Promotion1," A great way to deal with your anxiety is to critically examine your strengths and challenges when it comes to your job and promotion. While identifying strengths will boost your confidence, identifying challenges will help you know where you need improvement.


Make a list of your strengths. List things you know you’re good at, won awards for, or things others have complimented you for.
Consider your challenges. This is a great time to critically assess where you need some work. Common challenges may include how you interact with coworkers, your organizational approach, or the way you manage time.
When listing strengths and challenges, think about prior performance evaluations and conversations with supervisors.;
, The first step in mastering your new position is to gain a complete understanding of the job you’ll be assuming. Without this information, you won’t be able to set priorities for your new job or put together a plan of action.


Learn about how you will be evaluated. For instance, does your boss expect certain productivity levels, milestones, or growth?
Speak with the person who previously held the job, if possible. They may have insight that can help you understand the job. Say something like “John, can you tell me about some of the challenges or opportunities I might face in this position?” This will work best if that person has been promoted, too.
Ask for any appropriate records or documents associated with the position. For instance, if you’re being promoted to general manager of a fast food restaurant, take some time to look at your cash flow and income statements. You may see problems or possibilities where the previous GM did not.Understand that this will take time. Don't expect to have completely mastered and understood your new position after a month.

, Before assuming your new position, you need to spend time devising a plan and setting priorities. Without putting together a plan of action, you’ll feel unfocused and anxious about your new job.


Think about short-term goals and what you need to do on your first day or during the first month after your promotion. This may include hiring new staff or reorganizing a division or department.
Think about long-term goals, such as boosting efficiency and productivity.
Set personal goals and priorities. For instance, you may look into additional certifications that you can acquire to help you succeed in your new role and move up in the company. Or you may want to take some courses that help you develop skills important in leadership, such as communication or negotiation., Use a planner to keep track of everything you need to do. Having things down in writing will help you stay organized and clear your mind of all the little tasks you want to try and complete. This way, you can be sure you won't forget to do something, and you can focus on what you're working on in the moment instead of trying to remember all the other things you'll need to do.

Use your planner to break large tasks down into smaller, more manageable tasks. For instance, if you have a presentation at the end of the week, schedule time each day to work on a different section so that the deadline doesn't sneak up on you, leaving you stressed and unprepared.

, Confidence is one of the keys to overcoming anxiety and excelling at whatever you do. Without confidence, you’ll second guess yourself and fear failure. Becoming confident in your new role will take time — it requires you to become familiar with the job and master your responsibilities — so in the meantime, it's important to esteem yourself and remember that you are capable.


Reflect on your abilities and think about why you’ve been selected for a promotion. Ask yourself, “Why would management pick me for this position if I was not capable?”
Think about your experience, education, and people skills. These are assets that make you a valuable employee., In order to excel at your career, you need to manage any stress associated with your job. Fortunately, there are a variety of relaxation methods you can embrace to deal with your stress and anxieties.


Practice yoga.
Use breathing exercises. For example, when you find yourself becoming stressed or anxious, inhale deeply and slowly exhale while counting to ten.
Make time to exercise. Whether it's yoga or running or just taking a walk around the block, any form of exercise can help you deal with stress. Exercise boosts your endorphins, can be a form of meditation, increases confidence, and improves mood.Eat healthy. When people are stressed, they often reach for comfort foods to help them feel better. This often leads to overeating and guilt and, if you binge on something sweet, the drastic rise and drop in insulin could cause serious mood swings. Eat healthy, well-balanced meals, and never skip a meal because you think you're too busy.
Embrace mindfulness and live in the moment. To do this, focus on present tasks and keep everything in perspective. By doing this, you'll keep your stresses in perspective and will effectively manage anxiety."

Remember, there are several possible reasons for the demotion. An emotional display or bad attitude will only make things worse before you have had time to make good decisions., Speak with your supervisor. Ask for a meeting if they didn't tell you in person. In the privacy of the meeting you can request more specific information that you may be lacking, such as the reason for, and tangible consequences of, the demotion.Ask about things such as:


The extent of your pay cut.
Your new job responsibilities.

, Really listen to what your supervisor has to say. It may be that they have some good information that can help you improve if it turns out the demotion actually is due to your work., Although it can be very difficult to hear any negative critiques of your work, being receptive and respectful in your exchange tells them that you care about the company and your standard of work. This can help you in the long run by assuring your continued employment while you make important decisions about your future.If you feel you will not be able to remain professional due to your emotions, ask your boss for half-day leave or a day off to process, but be prepared to do the best you can if they deny your request.

, Call on those who are part of your support system once you are away from work and able to vent. They will not only shore you up emotionally, bring fresh perspectives to the situation.


It is unwise to discuss the details with co-workers, as it can place both them, and you, in uncomfortable or compromising positions.

, Having the demotion, and all its specifics, in writing can keep things clear and make certain you and your supervisor are on the same page about what is now expected of you., You might not need any of this information, but you never know, and it's better to have everything documented than to realize too late that it could have helped you.


Just to be on the safe side, keep the documentation on a home computer or flash drive, not on your work computer.

, You might, for example, decide to deal with the decision if it comes from company reorganization or is warranted based on your performance. Although a demotion can seem on the surface like nothing but a negative, there are times when it presents a positive move forward for you and your career, such as:A chance to work with new people on new projects.
The chance to grow by developing new skill sets.
Less responsibilities, therefore less stress.
The possibility of having more time to spend with family.
Freedom from difficult co-workers or a toxic environment.

, Many organizations have an internal mechanism in place for appealing decisions such as firings and demotions. If your company has such an option in place, there are times when this might be the right path for you to consider, such as:You truly believe that the demotion is unjust due to misinformation.
You have evidence that the demotion is directly due to discrimination of some sort from the supervisor demoting you.
You want the chance to challenge the decision and plead your case.

, If internal appeals don't work or you simply don't trust the internal process, you can consider the more drastic approach. Although this option can create a hostile situation between you and your employer, depending on the situation and the company you work for, you may need the support of a mediator or an employment lawyer to help you in your search for resolution.Times when this might be necessary can include:


Your company lacks any avenue to address worker grievances.
A badly handled appeal process resulted in a rejection of your claim.
You feel you cannot get a fair hearing due to internal prejudice.

, It might not feel like it, but a demotion is better than being fired outright. Let yourself appreciate the fact that you still have a paycheck that will buy you the time to decide how you want to move forward., Don't burn bridges by becoming difficult or overly emotional at work. The more pleasant and professional you stay, the more likely it will be that you will have others willing to help you, speak up for you, or give you references should you move on to other job prospects.

, Discreetly looking for other job openings while staying professional in your new position will open up possibilities while keeping you financially supported.Being discreet is important, as announcing the fact that you are looking at other jobs will give the impression that you don't respect your current company and aren't likely to be working to the best of your abilities.

, A contact list of co-workers you trust who are likely to write letters of recommendations will come in handy if you find a new position you would like to apply for.

, Internal job boards or company newsletters may regularly list jobs that you could apply to that would allow you to move laterally. A lateral move, rather than a vertical one, can present new possibilities you weren't previously aware of.

, Your title has staying power; it shows up on your resume while your pay does not. Although a cut in pay can be problematic at the time, the title on your resume has value that can translate into a much better paying job elsewhere in the future., We often learn better from our mistakes and failures than from our successes. Once you understand what brought about the demotion, if it is anything that is within your power to change, then you can take that knowledge, grow from it, and use it to be more successful in the future.

, Whatever you decide to do, maintaining balance between your private life and your work life will go a long way to keeping you happier and healthier, which will ultimately lead to a successful life.Don't bring your work worries home with you.
Keep friends and family close.

Depending on the person, your boss may even offer you valuable insight about how you can excel.


Make it clear that you want to both work with and for your new supervisor. When first talking to your supervisor about the promotion, let them know that you “look forward to working with them.”
Ask your boss if there are any priorities they want you to focus on. For instance, say something like, ""Jim, before I get started, is there anything you want me to focus on from the get go? I know you have high expectations, and I want to make sure I exceed them.""
Always be respectful of your boss.
Be deferential and don’t overstep your position or authority. Let your boss know that they are in charge. For example, if your boss prefers you to refer to them by their title (Dr., Mrs., or Mr.), respect that., Always prepare yourself before talking with your new supervisor about your promotion. By being prepared, you’ll be ready to talk with knowledge about the position. This will most likely impress your new supervisor and help you to be more confident.


Explain your goals and priorities for the position. For example, explain your short-term, long-term, or personal goals.
If you have a meeting about the promotion, make sure you’ve taken the time to look over any associated documents. For instance, say something like ""I've looked at the comps and the cash flow statement of the location, and I really think that there is a huge opportunity for growth.""
Stay focused on your goal and on demonstrating that you are capable and should be promoted., A good way to handle your anxiety is to refocus it into enthusiasm. ""Focus on the positive, fun or creative aspects of the new position instead of the challenges.


Say something like “Thank you so much for this opportunity — I’m really looking forward to showing the organization what I can do.”
Let your boss know what aspects of the job you are really looking forward to. For instance, if you’re tasked with the challenge of establishing a new location, let them know that you think it is an exciting opportunity to get into a new market."

Look to your network for someone you trust and admire who is willing to spend time with you and help you develop professionally. Your mentor will be able to provide you with valuable insight about the promotion process.


Schedule a lunch with your mentor.
Share your concerns and anxieties with your mentor. For example, say something like, “Tom, I’m really nervous about this promotion. I think it entails a level of management I’ve never had before.”
Listen to your mentor. As someone senior in your field, they’ll likely have had similar experiences over the course of their career., Your friends and family will be able to provide you with encouragement about your abilities.


Talk to your significant other. They’ll likely understand your anxieties and insecurities more than anyone else. Thus, they’ll be able to offer comfort that others may not be able to provide.
Practice what you’ll say with your boss with your family. Have friends and family put together mock interviews., By networking with colleagues, you’ll be able to get their opinion on the promotion and what opportunities or challenges you’ll find with it. They may offer new and creative insights that you can apply in your new position.


Trusted colleagues have observed you in the work environment and will be able to give you a good idea of your strengths and weaknesses.
Say something like “I’m really nervous about this new position. Do you think I can handle it?” Most of the time, they’ll answer in the affirmative and tell you why.
Remember to be sensitive to the feelings of people you may work with — you might not be the only one who wanted a promotion."

Publish the final policy in your employee handbook.",How to Suspend an Employee," Let’s say someone complains that a supervisor assaulted them. You shouldn’t immediately suspend the supervisor since you don’t know what has happened. Perform at least a preliminary investigation into the allegations.Meet with the person making the complaint. They might have complained by email or to your secretary, but you need to meet them in person. Go over the substance of their complaint to check whether it is plausible on its face.;
, Ideally, you have a policy in place that allows you to suspend an employee. Take out your policy and read it so that you understand it. If you don’t follow your policy, you might be sued for discrimination.


You might not have a policy, in which case you should tread carefully! In the U.S., most employment is at will, and you can suspend an employee at any time.However, you want to protect yourself legally.

, Wrongful termination lawsuits are expensive, so you need to make sure the suspension is legal. Every country and state has its own labor laws, so there’s no “one size fits all” approach to employee suspensions. For example, labor laws in the U.S., U.K., and Australia are very different from each other. Contact your business attorney to discuss the specifics of your situation and what the law requires.


Get a referral to an attorney if you don’t already have one. Contact your nearest bar association and ask for someone who specializes in labor and employment issues.Talk openly with your lawyer about what you want to do. For example, you might want to fire the employee. Your lawyer needs to know that since it could affect what actions you take.

, Fully explore whether you can keep the employee working without suspending them. This might be the best choice. You avoid any possibility of a lawsuit, and your employee can still contribute to the business.


For example, you might be able to move the employee to a different department or let them work from home.This might be ideal if an employee has been accused of sexual harassment but you need to perform an investigation.

, Suspension is a pretty dramatic remedy, so seriously consider whether it is appropriate. For example, most employers suspend in the following situations:The employee has broken a written policy and the suspension is a form of punishment.
You need to investigate allegations against the employee, and you’re afraid they may destroy evidence if they stay at work or be disruptive.
Relationships between employees have broken down and you need to keep them apart.

, Avoid suspending the employee indefinitely, since that too closely resembles a dismissal. In fact, try to suspend them for as short a length of time as possible.In the U.S., you can’t suspend someone for half a day.Instead, federal law requires that you suspend someone for at least a full day.

, You can certainly suspend someone without paying them. However, it might not be the best choice, depending on the circumstances. Consider the following:


Your state law might say all wages are due at the time of termination. Depending on how long your investigation lasts, the suspension could legally qualify as a termination. In this situation, you might be sued for unpaid wages if you ultimately fire the employee.To protect yourself, you might want to pay wages during the suspension, but you should talk about this with your lawyer.
However, you can avoid paying if you have a contractual right not to pay them.Look at your employment contract.

, In the U.S., an employee is exempt if they are paid a salary of at least $455 a week and meets other requirements. You need to be careful about suspending an exempt employee. You run the risk of converting the employee to a non-exempt employee, which means you might need to pay overtime.You can suspend an exempt employee without pay for serious infractions, such as allegations of sexual harassment, workplace violence, drug/alcohol abuse, or violations of the law. However, you should pay the employee if you suspend for minor issues, like poor attendance or attitude.

, You might think it’s easiest just to tell the employee they’re suspended. However, you need to protect yourself as an employer. Write a letter in which you explain the key terms of the suspension, such as the following:Duration. Let them know the date they can return to work. Don’t write, “You’re suspended for a week” since no one knows when the week will end. Instead, write, “You are suspended immediately and may return to work on June 6, 2017.”
Whether the suspension is a disciplinary action. You might need to suspend someone so you can perform a more thorough investigation. In this situation, clarify that the suspension isn’t a disciplinary act.
Employee obligations. You might want the employee to remain available so you can call them during the workweek. You might also prohibit them from calling other employees during their suspension.

, Meet with them in private.Ask them to come to your office and set aside enough time so you won’t be rushed or interrupted. Tell the employee what they’ve done wrong and that you are suspending them.


Be respectful. You can expect the employee to be upset, so de-escalate the situation as much as possible. Avoid raising your voice or making aggressive gestures.
Also listen to what the employee says. They might know they’re struggling at work. For example, they could have problems at home. Now is the time to recommend that they contact the employee assistance program to get help with home problems.

, Document what each person said and put your notes in the personnel file.Attach the notes to a copy of the letter you gave the employee.

, You might need to let other employees know about the suspension. Be careful what you say. You don’t want to give the impression that you’ve found the person guilty if you’re still performing an investigation.For example, you can tell other team members that there have been complaints about the employee. Clarify that you’re only investigating and don’t know whether they are true or not.
However, keep the substance of the complaints to yourself. Don't say, ""Jillian has accused Jeff of sexual harassment.""

, You need to tell employees what behavior is acceptable and unacceptable.Get as detailed as you want. For example, you might want to prohibit personal phone calls at work. If so, your code of conduct should state, “No personal calls are allowed at work without a supervisor’s permission.”


Also include general language about the values your business will uphold. For example, you probably want to uphold integrity, honesty, and teamwork.

, You must follow the same disciplinary process for every employee, so put it in writing. This will protect you from claims of discrimination. Remember to include only the steps you intend to take.

, Some disciplinary systems are “progressive,” meaning you start out with a verbal warning and increase the punishments for each additional infraction. Progressive disciplinary systems have some benefits and drawbacks. You should consider each.


For example, one benefit is transparency. Employees know exactly what will happen if they commit misconduct.A progressive system also gives employees a chance to improve their performance.
One drawback is that you might be tied to the system whether you want to follow it or not.
Progressive disciplinary systems also require quite a bit of paperwork.

, If you choose to use a progressive disciplinary system, you need to create a sequence of punishments, beginning with the least serious. Consider using the following steps:First offense: oral warning. Meet with the employee and advise them how to change their conduct.
Second offense: written warning. Follow up your coaching and set a deadline for employee improvement.
Third offense: suspension. Let the employee come up with a plan for improving their performance while out on suspension. You can review it before they start working again.
Fourth offense: termination. When an employee can’t improve their performance, suspension is appropriate. One benefit of the progressive disciplinary system is that termination shouldn’t be a surprise to the employee.

, Some actions are so destructive that you might want to skip giving a verbal warning and go immediately to suspension or termination. Identify what behaviors will be treated differently, such as the following:embezzlement
theft
violence on company property
bullying or harassment (including sexual harassment)
disclosing trade secrets and other confidential information
insubordination
lying on a job application

, Ask the lawyer if anything is missing. Your lawyer can also help you assess the strengths and weaknesses of your chosen disciplinary process. For example, if you choose a progressive disciplinary system, then you might change the “at will” status of your employees.Consider all of your options.


Meet with your lawyer ahead of time if you don’t know what kind of disciplinary system you want., Remember to include cautionary language that you will use the disciplinary procedures as guidance. However, you still reserve the right to modify the policy in the future.Also clarify that the disciplinary system doesn’t change the “at will” relationship."

Know that you have 99 weeks of benefits.",How to File for Unemployment," After becoming unemployed, it is important to gather the necessary information and file a claim quickly in order to receive benefits as soon as possible. It can take up to two weeks to receive benefits after filing a claim; the first week is an unpaid period, and the second is a lag period for the claim to be processed. So, start the process as soon as you are laid off to reduce the time before receiving a check and to avoid missing your application deadline.;
, Not all unemployed individuals are eligible for unemployment insurance, so you need to determine whether you belong to one of the excluded categories before applying. Individuals ineligible for unemployment include self-employed, part-time, and temporary workers. You can also be excluded if you were fired as the result of misconduct or a labor dispute, or if you voluntarily left your job without good cause.


Certain states, like Texas, have options for some temp workers.
Note that once you file a claim, you must agree to look for work in order to remain eligible. You must be available to work at all times, and you must not refuse work that is offered to you.
If you are unsure about your eligibility, or even if you think you belong to one of the excluded groups, apply anyway. There is an appeals process for workers who believe they are eligible but have been denied benefits.

, Before you begin your application, you will need to collect a few key pieces of information that will be used on the form. This includes information about both yourself and your last employer.


You: name, address, phone number, driver’s license/state ID number, social security number, final day of work, information about your wages, including overtime, holiday pay, etc.
Employer: name, address, phone number.
You may be asked to provide additional information, such as the name of your last supervisor, your ""normal"" wages or your alien registration number if you are not a U.S. citizen. Some states also pay out claims by direct deposit, in which case you will need to provide your bank account information.

, Unemployment insurance in the United States is run on a state-by-state basis, so each state has a separate agency to deal with unemployment applications and benefits. (The process for each state is largely similar, however.) You can find your state’s unemployment station by doing an Internet search such as “file for unemployment + ."" This will allow you to visit the site for your state’s agency, where you can apply online or find the appropriate telephone number to call.


Make sure that you go to the genuine site for your state’s unemployment agency, as online searches can be full of scam websites. The website should have a .gov domain name.
You may often find it referred to as ""UI"" or ""unemployment insurance.""

, Once you have found the website for your state unemployment agency, you are ready to begin the application process. Decide whether you want to apply online or via telephone. Most states recommend using the online application, as it is the fastest and most efficient.


If you choose to apply online, find the appropriate link on the website and fill in all the necessary information on the application form.
If you would like to apply by phone, search for the appropriate phone number on the site and the hours you should call.Depending on your location, you may talk to an actual agent or an automated system. However, a human should always be available to handle your call if it becomes necessary. Read out the appropriate information when prompted to complete your application.

Some states do still have a paper version you can print out and take in to the Unemployment office, though it's not the quickest method., If the unemployment agency has any questions or concerns about your application, they will call you at the number that you listed on your application. So, in the days after you submit your form, be ready to answer the agency’s call and respond to their questions with the appropriate information.


The people who are handling your form or working during business hours, so be sure to provide them with a phone you can be reached at during the day.

, Once your claim is processed, you will receive information about your status through the mail. Processing can take up to 10 days; after this period you should receive information about the program, your eligibility, and the amount of money that you will be able to receive. Depending on your state, you may also receive a notification for a follow-up phone call. Read all of this information carefully, and follow up as necessary with any additional instructions.


If you do not receive anything in the mail after the 10-day processing period, your claim may not have been processed. If this is the case, go back to the website for your state’s unemployment agency and look for a phone number to call. Call the agency and tell them about your problem.
Technically these forms are called a Notice of Unemployment Insurance Award, a Notice of Unemployment Insurance Claim Filed, a Continued Claim Form, and, depending on your state, you may receive ""A Guide to Benefits and Employment Services"" and a brochure about your state's ""jobs"" website.. Your former employer will be alerted as to your claim at this juncture., After your application has been processed, you will receive a claim form. This form includes questions about your job search, your availability for potential work, and any work that you may have done in the last 2 weeks. Fill out the form completely in order to avoid delays in receiving your benefits.


If you're curious, the average unemployment check is $293.Fill out everything honestly. Falsifying any of these documents is considered fraud and is a third-degree felony., Depending on the route you chose, your money should either come in the form of being direct deposited into one of your pre-existing bank accounts or a new account should be started for you. If the latter was your choice, you should receive a debit card in the mail.


Keep a watch on this account. Once you receive your debit card (or get notice that the direct deposit process as started), keep an eye on your accounts. The money should be deposited shortly.

, When you receive your first payment, you will also receive a continued claim form. This is like the first form that you filled out, but applies to the current two-week period. Make sure that you fill out this form for each period for which you are eligible in order to keep receiving benefits. Do not send in this form too early or too late, as this may force your state agency to send you another form or to conduct a phone interview, both of which can delay your payments.


Look on the website for your state’s unemployment agency or review the information that they sent you for more detailed information about the continued claims form and for maintaining your eligibility.

, Unemployment Insurance is a program started long ago for people that lost their jobs through no fault of their own. It is not a program for people to delay finding work. To assure the program maintains its original purpose, it is imperative you continue looking for work -- if you don't, your benefits will lapse.


You will need to prove that you're sending out resumes, going to interviews, and actively looking for employment. This is all part of your continued claim forms.

, It used to be that you had 26 weeks to receive unemployment checks before -- now it's 99. As of January of 2013, there were about 1.5 million ""99ers"" in the US. That includes all unemployment extensions.That's just short of two years, by the way. Though it seems like a long time, many people, unfortunately, hit that mark.

Wait for a decision.",How to Get California Unemployment Benefits," To qualify for UI benefits in California, you must have lost your last job through no fault of your own.This means that if you quit your last job for unacceptable reasons or were fired with cause, you may not be eligible to receive UI benefits.Acceptable reasons for quitting or losing your job include: layoffs, downsizing, or quitting because of harassment or significant medical reasons.Unacceptable reasons for quitting or losing your job include: quitting because you didn't like your job, quitting to change careers, or getting fired because of serious and repeated lapses in judgment or performance.With that said, your past employer's definition of bad performance or lapses in judgment may be different from the California Employment Development Department's (EDD's) definition of those things. You should still apply for UI benefits if you feel you are entitled to them. Also, try negotiating with your employer and ask that they not challenge your UI application.;
, When you file a UI claim, your past employers will report your wages to the EDD.The EDD will use this information to decide if you have earned enough wages during a ""base period"" to establish a UI claim.A ""base period"" is simply a specified 12 month period used to calculate your past earnings.If you need to calculate what your base period would be, visit this website, which offers in depth instructions about how unemployment benefits are computed.

, UI benefits are only available to individuals who are lawfully in the United States, either as a citizen or a legal immigrant.You may be required to show proof of your lawful status in order to receive UI benefits. Some forms of proof may include a social security card, a birth certificate, a photo I.D., or a green card with work authorization.

, To qualify for UI benefits and to continue receiving benefits, you must be physically able to work, you must be immediately available to accept work, and you must be conducting an active job search.If you have a temporary disability that prevents you from working, you may be temporarily ineligible for UI benefits.You may, however, be eligible for State Disability Insurance (SDI).If you are in a position where you temporarily cannot accept work (e.g., you are sick or plan on traveling), you may be temporarily ineligible for UI benefits.To be eligible for UI benefits, you must be actively seeking work.If EDD ultimately determines you are eligible for UI benefits, you may be required to submit evidence of your job search by providing the name, position, and date you apply for positions.As such, be sure to keep track of the jobs you apply for., To start the application process, you will need to go here. Once there, you will click on the link that says ""File For Unemployment."" Before going any further, make sure you have the following information readily available:


Your name and social security number;
Your address;
Your state-issued I.D. number;
The date you last worked for any employer;
Your last employer's information, including their name, address, and phone number;
Information about all employers you have worked for in the past 18 months;
Reasons as to why you are no longer employed;
Whether you are receiving, or expect to receive, any payments from your past employers;
Whether you are available and able to work; and
Whether you have the legal right to work in the United States., Once you have gathered your required information and you are at the EDD UI filing website, you will choose how you want to file your UI application. You can choose to file online, over the phone, by mail, or by fax.If you are applying over the phone, click here and call the designated number. After doing so, follow the directions provided to you over the phone.
If you are applying by mail or fax, click here. You will then go here, which will allow you to complete the application online then print it, or you can print it and fill it out with a pen. Once you have completed the application, fax it or mail it to the number or address provided.Click here for a printable UI application.
If you are applying online, click here and start the application. When you are finished, you will be prompted to submit the application online.

, Once you have submitted your UI application, EDD will evaluate the application and follow-up as necessary. You can expect to hear back from EDD within about ten days of applying.EDD will determine your eligibility based on your application and potentially even information obtained from your past employers.Depending on the information you and your employer provide, you may be scheduled for a telephone interview so EDD can acquire additional information to determine you eligibility.If EDD determines you are eligible for UI benefits, you will begin receiving UI benefit checks.If EDD determines you are not eligible for benefits, you will receive a “Notice of Determination,” which will explain why you were denied benefits and will give you information on how to appeal their determination.The Notice of Determination will look like this. Individuals are often denied benefits because they do not meet the threshold eligibility requirements outlined in Part 1.

, If you have been found by EDD to be eligible for UI benefits, you will be sent a Continued Claim Form, which can also be found here.You will fill out this form and mail it, file it online, or complete the process over the phone.This process will need to be repeated every two weeks.If you are filing online you can go here and follow the directions to complete the form.
The Continued Claim Form includes questions regarding whether you were able to work; whether you looked for work; whether you did in fact work work; and finally, the form asks you to complete a work search record, which asks you to report the jobs you applied for.If you have concerns about how you should answer certain questions on the Continued Claim Form, you can follow this guide. It provides step-by-step instructions on how to answer each question on the form.

, If you find work while you are receiving UI benefits, you are required to disclose that information on your biweekly Continued Claim Form.Whether you receive money for your services or not, you still must disclose the number of hours you worked, who you worked for, how much money you made, and whether you are still working there.Failing to report this information can result in UI fraud, which may subject you to severe punishment.Be sure you look here for information on how to correctly report any income you receive.

, UI benefits normally last for one year.If you have received one year of UI benefits and are still unemployed and otherwise eligible for normal UI benefits, you may be able to receive a federal extension on your UI benefits.If you are eligible, EDD will automatically file your first extension and they will simply continue to send you your Continued Claim Form every other week.If you need to file more than one extension, EDD will again automatically do so for you and continue to send you your Continued Claim Forms., Many people who are rightfully eligible for UI benefits are denied them. If you suspect you were wrongfully denied, EDD has an appeals process. Review your Notice of Determination, which will lay out the reasons you were denied UI benefits, and, if you believe they wrongly denied your UI application, you can request an appeal.


The most common reason for being denied UI benefits is not meeting the minimum eligibility requirements (discussed in Part 1). For example, EDD may determine that you lost your job as a result of performance issues or because you quit voluntarily. These determinations are often made by EDD after interviewing your past employers.
The most common denials that are appealed involve voluntary quits and misconduct.If you are denied UI benefits because you quit your job, be prepared to prove that you quit with good cause (i.e., you had a real and compelling reason to quit).If you are denied UI benefits because of alleged misconduct, your employer will have the burden of proving that misconduct on appeal.This is good news for you; it is often possible to win an appeal based on alleged misconduct because your employer may not have the necessary evidence to prove it., If you disagree with EDD's reasons for denying your UI benefits, you must submit your appeal within 20 calendar days of the date on your EDD Notice of Determination.Keep your appeal simple and only state you wish to appeal the decision (e.g., ""I disagree with the decision by EDD and I am entitled to UI benefits under the law"").Saying anything else may actually hurt your chances of winning an appeal.You can choose to either submit an appeal form or an appeal letter. The appeal form can be found here. When the form is completed, simply send it in with a copy of your Notice of Determination. If you are writing an appeal letter, simply state that you are appealing and send it to the address designated in your Notice of Determination.Make sure you include your name, address, phone number, and social security number., After submitting your appeal, EDD will send you a notice acknowledging your appeal as well as a notice of a hearing.At the hearing you will be able to present the reasons why your UI claim should be granted and, depending on the reason for the denial, your employer will have an opportunity to attend the hearing and present evidence as well.Review the appeal file.The appeal file is available at the Office of Appeals (at an address that will be provided to you in a letter) and you need to retrieve a copy to analyze before the hearing.The file will contain claim notes, employer protests, records of interviews, your Notice of Determination, and the appeal letter.Learn the basics of the law that applies to your appeal.You should understand the basic law that will govern your appeal. Look through this guide, which should provide you with the basic information you need.

Gather supporting documents.In addition to the documentation in your appeal file, you should also be prepared to introduce other evidence at the hearing.Some of the evidence you should try to bring includes performance reviews, personnel manuals, employee commendations and/or reprimands, and any written correspondence between you and your past employer.Consider contacting an attorney to help you with your appeal. You are allowed to bring a representative with you to the appeals hearing and you may want to hire an attorney for that reason. An attorney can help you navigate the process and present a persuasive case on your behalf. Consider contacting your local legal services organization since they often deal with these types of issues. If you are in San Francisco, try contacting the Legal Aid Society Employment Law Center.

, Your UI appeal hearing will either be conducted in person or in some limited circumstances it will be conducted via telephone.An administrative law judge or representative from your state unemployment insurance agency will conduct the hearing.At the hearing, the administrative law judge will make introductory remarks and will turn on a recording device in order to make a record of the proceedings.In addition, the administrative law judge will give you an overview of the hearing process.After the preliminary remarks, the agency representative will ask you questions related to your UI claim and through this process you will have an opportunity to share why you are entitled to UI benefits and present evidence.If your employer attends, they will also have an opportunity ask you questions related to your UI claim., After your hearing, your state agency will send you a decision.The hearing officer will state the facts of your case as well as the basis for their decision.If you disagree with the decision you can appeal again.If you wish to appeal, you have 20 days to file an additional appeal."

Find out if your state offers extended unemployment compensation.,
Make sure you still fit the criteria for unemployment benefits.,
Gather all of the necessary information and documentation.,
Contact your state's Department of Labor.,
Fill out all the necessary paperwork.,
Wait for an approval to come in the mail.,
Continue looking for work.",How to Extend Unemployment Compensation," Although the federal government used to mandate that states had to offer extended unemployment benefits, Congress did not renew this law in 2013. It now varies from state to state whether extended benefits are available. Your first step before moving on should be finding out if your state offers extended benefits.Most state Department of Labor (DOL) websites will let you know if extended benefits are available. Try visiting your state's DOL site and searching for extended benefits.
If you're unsuccessful on the DOL site, you could contact the state unemployment office directly by phone or in person. Employees should be aware if the state offers extended benefits.
States might only offer extensions during periods of high unemployment. If your state doesn't offer extensions at the moment, that may change in the future if an economic downturn is beginning. Keep checking in with the DOL to stay updated.;
, Since unemployment insurance is managed by the states, there may be different criteria for who can file a claim. The basic definition, however, is that you've lost your job due to no fault of your own (like being laid off) and are actively seeking work.If you've given up actively seeking work, you're usually no longer eligible for unemployment insurance.


Immigrants and permanent residents in the US are also eligible for unemployment benefits. The process is often the same as for anyone else, but contact your state Department of Labor to find out if there is anything else you have to do for benefits., Applying for extended benefits is similar to when you originally applied for unemployment compensation. If your state offers extended benefits, you'll need a few key pieces of information to get started. Gather all of this and have it on hand when you contact the Department of Labor to make the process as smooth as possible.Your social security number.
A complete work history.
Your reason for unemployment. The Department of Labor will probably check with your last employer about the conditions of your losing your job, so don't lie here. If you claim you were laid off but were actually fired for fighting with a coworker, you could be charged with fraud. The penalties for this crime can range from a fine to prison time.Since you're applying for extended benefits, the DOL may also ask about your job search and inquire about why you've been unable to find work so far. Also be truthful here. The DOL may contact jobs you've applied for to confirm that you sent in an application. If the DOL finds that you've lied about your job search, you could also be charged with fraud., Since laws are different from state to state, the process of applying for an extension will depend on what state you live in. For example, some states have a fully online application, while others want materials mailed. The best source for information on how to apply is your state DOL. Follow all the instructions they provide to ensure a successful extension of benefits., In addition to your employment history and proof of citizenship, there will be several government forms to fill out to request an extension. When you contact the DOL, they will either mail you these forms or tell you where you can access them on the internet. Fill them out completely and either fax or mail them to the unemployment office, depending on your state laws.Make sure all information is up to date and accurate. If the DOL has information that you submitted with your original request for unemployment compensation, double check it. If there are any errors, there could be an unnecessary delay in getting your benefits.
It may be useful to know that, in some states, forms can be completed at local unemployment offices with helpful staff.

, After you sign and submit all the necessary paperwork to your state unemployment office, you'll have to wait to receive word that you've been approved for extended benefits.When you get word that you've been approved, you should keep receiving payments for as long as the extension lasts or until you find work. Payment may come in the form of a check, but direct deposit into your checking account is more popular., When you receive your extension, don't slow down your job search. The extension may only be for a few more weeks, and then you probably won't be able to get another one. Take this time to continue your job search and find work before your benefits run out.

, If filing online, you only need to enter the numbers, which are necessary both to confirm your identity and so that the UIA can be sure you have not filed for unemployment benefits simultaneously in another state.If you file in person at a Problem Resolution Office, you will need to have your social security card and driver's license with you., You will need to provide a mailing address where information about your claim can be sent, as well as a phone number where UIA staff can contact you. If you do not have a phone, you will need a number where UIA staff can leave a message., If you have no bank account, you can have your benefits sent directly to a debit card issued by the UIA.If you do have a bank, you can get the debit card or choose to have your benefits deposited directly into your account. If you decide to have your money direct deposited, you will need:The ABA check routing number: a 9-digit code, it is the first number listed at the bottom of your checks.
You bank account number: the number at the bottom of your check that follows the routing number. Be sure not to include the check number, which typically follows the account number.

, If you are not a citizen or national of the United States, you will need your registration number along with the expiration date on you alien ID or immigration documents in order to register for unemployment., The UIA will use your employment information to calculate your eligibility and your benefits, which are based on the gross wages paid you in the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters preceding the Sunday of the week in which you file your claim. Quarters run from January 1 to March 31, April 1 to June 30, July 1 to September 30, and October 1 to December 31. If possible, collect W-2 forms from the last 18 months; they contain your employer’s Federal Employer Identification Number, which will speed the process. In addition, for each employer you will need:Employer’s name and payroll address
Beginning and end dates of employment
Quarterly gross earnings for you most recent period of continuous employment with them
Wages that do not count towards benefits include: minors working limited hours during school or during the summer; wages of legislators, judges, and elected officials; wages earned while working for a church, unless that church has elected to have coverage; and self-employment or work directly for a spouse."

Make sure you are actively seeking employment.,
Double check your eligibility if you have recently received benefits.,
Determine the base period for calculating your wages.,
Check if your wages qualify under the regular qualifying method.,
See if your wages qualify under the Alternate Earnings Qualifier (AEQ).",How to File for Unemployment in Michigan2," To be eligible for unemployment benefits you must not only be unemployed, you must also be actively seeking suitable full-time work. This means searching for work with at least 2 different employers every week. You must submit a record of your work search at least once a month online at http://www.michigan.gov/uia or by mail, fax, or in person using form UIA 1583, available at https://www.michigan.gov/documents/uia/1583_268058_7.pdf. Your records should include:The name of the employers where work was sought, or the name of the search engine or employment agency used.
The online or physical location of the employers.
The dates on which work was sought.
The method used to seek work with each employer.

, If you have received unemployment benefits within the last year and a half, then to be eligible for a renewal of benefits:You must have worked after your prior benefit year began.
Over the course of this work, you must have been paid at least five times the last weekly benefit amount that was in effect.

, Qualifying wages typically come from the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters prior to when you filed your claim. If you cannot qualify based on this standard base period, the UIA will use your wages in the four most recently completed quarters as an alternate base period.For example, if you filed for benefits on October 15, 2015, the five most recently completed quarters would be: July – September 2015; April – June 2015; January – March 2015; October – December 2014; and July – September 2014.
The standard base period in this example includes: April – June 2015; January – March 2015; October – December 2014; and July – September 2015.
The alternate base period includes: July – September 2015; April – June 2015; January – March 2015; and October – December 2014.

, In order to qualify for unemployment benefits, you must have earned certain minimum amounts.You must have wages in at least two quarters of your base period.
In one quarter your gross wages from all employers must be at least $2,871.
Total wages for the four quarters of the base period must equal at least one and a half times the highest amount of wages paid in any quarter.
For example, using the base periods in the previous step, if you earned $3000 in the January – March 2015 quarter, you would need to have earned $3000 x 1.5 = $4500 over the course of all four quarters combined.
If you do not qualify using the standard base period, try the alternate base period. If you still do not qualify, try the Alternate Earnings Qualifier.

, If you earned a large wage in one quarter and significantly smaller wages in the other quarters, so that your total earnings are not 1.5 times your high quarter wage, you may still qualify under the Alternate Earnings Qualifier.You must have wages in at least two quarters.
Total wages for all four quarters must be at least 20 times the state average weekly wage (SAWW). For 2015, the AEQ amount is $18,214.20 . You can find the SAWW chart for all years at https://www.michigan.gov/documents/wca/wca_averge-weekly-wage_chart_477569_7.pdf.
For example, if you earned wages in only two quarters – $12,900 in one and $5,500 in another – you would not be eligible under the regular qualifying method, because $12,900 x 1.5 = $19,350, and $12,900 + $5,500 = $18,400, which is smaller than $19,350.
However, in this example you would be still be eligible for benefits, because $18,400 is larger than $18,214.20, the minimum amount required to qualify under the AEQ.
Remember: if you don’t qualify under the AEQ during the standard base period, see if you qualify during the alternate base period.

Double check the benefit amount on your monetary determination.,
Multiply your high quarter wages by 4.1%.,
Add $6 per dependent for up to 5 dependents.,
Calculate the number of weeks of benefits.,
Protest your determination if necessary.",How to File for Unemployment in Michigan4," The Unemployment Insurance Agency (UIA) will send you a benefit form to tell you if your claim has been accepted. If so, the form will include your benefit rate and the number of weeks payable. Check these figures for accuracy to be sure you are getting all the money you deserve., This will be your base weekly benefit amount. The maximum weekly benefit is $362.For example, if you earned $4,500 during your highest earning quarter, then $4,500 x .041 = $184.5, which rounded up is $185. This would be your weekly benefit.
If you earned $10,000 during your highest quarter, then $4,500 x .041 = $410. This is more than the max of $362, so your weekly benefit would be $362.

, This money is added to your weekly benefit, but the maximum amount still cannot exceed $362.


For example, if you earned $4,500 as above and had 3 dependents, then your weekly benefit would be $6 x 3 (# of dependents) = $18, plus your $185 base benefit, for a total weekly benefit of $18 + $185 = $203.

, Take 43% of your total gross wages over the entire base period, and divide the result by your weekly benefit amount, then round down to the next lower ½ number. This will yield your benefit period, although regardless of this calculation, the minimum number of weeks is 14 and the maximum is 20.For example, let’s say you earned $4,500 in your highest quarter and $12,500 over the entire base period.
43% (.43) x $12,500 = $5,375.
$5,375 ÷ $185 (weekly benefit) = 29.05.
Rounding gives us 29 weeks. However, since the maximum is 20 weeks, that is how long you will receive benefits.

, If you believe your benefit amount or term is not accurate, you can file a protest. If you filed your claim online, you can login to your account and file a protest. If you filed by phone, call 1-866-500-0017 to protest. Alternately, you can visit a Problem Resolution Center to get help with your protest. For hours and addresses, consult www.michigan.gov.

Similarly, an employee can quit at any time and for any reason. Forty nine states are “at will” states (all but Montana).There are limits to “at will” employment. First, if you have an employment contract, then the contract supersedes the “at will” doctrine. Furthermore, statutory anti-discrimination laws also prohibit terminations motivated by bias against certain characteristics.
Also, some states will limit the ability to terminate for “public policy” reasons, e.g., you can’t be fired for failing to perform an illegal act or for reporting an employer’s illegal activity.;
, Federal statutes prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, and disability. It is illegal to fire someone for these reasons.


Federal law also prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex (whether the person is male or female). Keep in mind that “sex” encompasses pregnancy; accordingly, it is against the law to fire a woman because she is pregnant.Age discrimination. Under federal law, it is illegal to fire someone who is over the age of 40 because of their age.Discrimination based on sexual orientation is currently only prohibited for federal employees. However, “sexual orientation” discrimination may also fall under “sex.” For example, it is illegal to fire a gay male because he is too “effeminate” or otherwise fails to conform to sex stereotyping.
It is also illegal to fire someone in retaliation for the employee’s reporting of illegal discrimination.This prohibition applies even if the EEOC later finds that no discrimination occurred.

, Many states provide greater protection than the federal anti-discrimination laws. For example, about half of the states prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation., Wrongful termination cases can be based on “breach of contract” as well. Where you have an employment contract, your employer must abide by the terms of the contract. Any failure to abide by the terms can trigger a lawsuit.


For example, if you were guaranteed employment for a set amount of time, your employer has to honor that promise unless something else in the contract authorized your termination.
Some states will consider handbooks, policy manuals, and other documentation as creating “implied contracts” between employer and employee. Your implied contract might entitle you to a notice period or severance pay before being terminated.
Language in a handbook must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable employee would believe that a contract is being offered. For example, language such as “shall” or “must” or “never” before a promise is sufficiently clear evidence of a contractual promise.Also, verbal promises can constitute a contract. Some courts have found that where an employee relies on an employer’s promise to his or her detriment, then a contract has been created.

, You should look at your termination letter or email and try to find the reason given. The reason stated may not, in fact, be the real motivation. If you believe the motivation was discriminatory, then you can seek redress by filing a wrongful termination suit.

, “Constructive discharge” occurs when you quit your job because the working conditions were so intolerable that you felt you had no other choice but to leave.“Constructive discharge” is difficult to prove. You will need to show that the employer created or allowed the hostile work environment, or that your employer knew that the environment would likely cause you to quit. A good example is sexual harassment which your employer condones or participates in., If you believe you were illegally discriminated against, then you will need evidence of the bias. Relevant documents would include disciplinary notices, performance reviews, and any communications between you and your supervisor or other members of management.


Gathering documentation could be difficult. Some acts appear discriminatory only in hindsight. As best as you can, you should sit down and write down everything you remember being said or done that could indicate bias. Note dates, names, and how you responded.

, The EEOC is a federal agency created to handle cases of employment discrimination. Additionally, the EEOC gives you a choice to file a complaint with your state employment agency instead of the EEOC.


Some states provide more protection and afford plaintiffs more rights than the federal government, so it may be beneficial to file with the state agency. Check your state’s Department of Labor website to see if you have a state agency.
California, for example, allows applicants to request an immediate “right to sue” letter. This means that you would not need to wait to exhaust your administrative remedies before going to court, as you would with the EEOC.
California law also prohibits “English only” policies and discrimination based on sexual orientation, which federal law does not. Moreover, it defines “disability” more broadly than federal law., In some cases, you will need to work through a company policy for filing a grievance before you file a complaint with the EEOC or your state agency.


If you are thinking of quitting and filing a constructive discharge claim, then you will need to follow your company’s policies for reporting harassment or otherwise hostile conduct. Look in your employee handbook and follow any procedures.
If you belong to a union, then you should contact your union representative. Unions often have contract provisions that limit the ability of union workers to file work-related lawsuits., Employment law differs from state to state, and the facts of your case are unique. Only a qualified employment attorney can offer tailored legal advice.


To find an attorney, contact your state bar association. They should have a referral system.
If costs are a concern, ask about a contingency fee arrangement. Under this arrangement, an attorney only gets paid if she wins your case. Typically, she will get around 33% if the case settles and up to 40% if the case goes to trial.You will, however, be responsible for most court costs (such as filing fees, expert witness fees, and court reporter expenses).

, The EEOC has field offices around the country. Usually, you would file your complaint at the EEOC office that is nearest you or your place of employment.


To find an office, visit this website and enter your zip code.
If you are looking for a state agency, then check with your state’s Department of Labor.

, You should contact the EEOC (or state office) as soon as possible. There are many different deadlines that you will need to meet when pressing your claim for discrimination.


Generally, you must file a complaint with the EEOC within 180 days from when the discriminatory act happened.If your state has laws that prohibit discrimination on the same basis as federal laws, then the deadline is extended to 300 days., You can file a complaint in person at any EEOC office that you choose. Each office has its own procedure for how complaints are filed. However, you will typically be interviewed by an EEOC staff lawyer.


During the interview, the staff member will evaluate whether or not your employer’s actions seem to be illegal discrimination.

, If you can’t stop in, you can file by mail. To file by mail, send the EEOC a letter that includes the following information:your name, address, and telephone number
the name, address, and telephone number of the employer you want to file your complaint against
the number of employees employed there (if known)
a short description of the events you believe were discriminatory
when the events took place
why you believe you were discriminated against
your signature (required to begin the investigation)

, After interviewing you and receiving your complaint, the EEOC will decide whether or not to pursue your claim. Their decision will be mailed to you.


If the EEOC wants to pursue your complaint, they will send you a “Charge of Discrimination” form that describes the incident you described. You must review it and then sign it before sending it back.
Once the EEOC receives your signed “Charge” form, it will interview your former employer and try to facilitate a settlement., The EEOC has 180 days to decide whether or not to pursue your claim. If 180 days elapse, then you can request a “right to sue” letter, which authorizes you to file a lawsuit in federal court against your former employer.


Once you receive the letter, you have 90 days to file suit in federal court., If you are filing a breach of contract claim, then you will file in the state court where you were employed. If you are filing a federal anti-discrimination or retaliation claim, then you file in federal district court.


If you are suing under state or local anti-discrimination laws or ordinances, then you may file those suits in state court without first going through the EEOC., Your attorney should prepare the complaint for you. In the complaint, you will allege (through your lawyer) the facts that give rise to the lawsuit and the laws which authorize the suit.A sample complaint can be found here.
Always ask your attorney for a copy of everything filed in court. In this way you can keep track of how attentive your attorney is being toward your case.

, The complaint must be filed and a filing fee paid. You will likely be responsible for filing fees, even if you are operating under a contingency fee agreement.


If you are proceeding without an attorney, take the complaint to the court clerk’s office and say that you want to file. Be sure to bring multiple copies of the complaint and have the clerk time-stamp all of them.
If you are filing, then call ahead of time and ask the clerk how much the filing fee is and what methods of payment are acceptable.

, In order to initiate a wrongful termination suit, you must serve notice on your former employer, otherwise the court will not have the ability to hear your case. Service is typically done in a variety of ways: by mail or through the sheriff or a professional process server.


To serve through the mail, you must use certified mail, return receipt requested.
If you want the notice and summons personally served, then you should use either the county sheriff or a professional process server. In most counties, you can use either. Ask the clerk if either is allowed.
If you use personal service, then you must fill out a “Notice of Service” form. It may go by a different name. The purpose of this form is for the server to confirm that service was made. After being signed, it is filed with the court clerk.
Your attorney should handle service of process issues. The fee, if any, will have to be paid by you.

, Before trial, you and your former employer will go through a process known as discovery, in which you share with each other the documents and information you plan to use to prove your claims at trial.There are three basic stages of discovery: written discovery, document production, and depositions. Your former employer may contact you for a settlement during any of these stages.
During written discovery, you and your former employer will exchange written questions known as ""interrogatories."" You will submit answers in writing in response to the questions you're asked, unless there is a legal reason that your former employer is not entitled to the answer to that question.For example, your former employer might ask you something that actually is protected by attorney-client privilege. In those cases, you would respond by raising an objection that the question asks for information protected by attorney-client privilege.
During document production, you may ask your former employer to give you copies of documents that are potentially related to your case. For example, you might ask your employer to give you a copy of your entire personnel file.During depositions, you and your former employer interview each other and any possible witnesses in the case. For example, you may wish to interview the human resources supervisor in charge of recording and processing employee terminations.
When you conduct a deposition, the person being deposed is under oath just as if he was in a courtroom, and all questions and answers are recorded by a court reporter.

, At any point during discovery, you may decide that an ADR method such as mediation or arbitration would be a preferable means of resolving your problem.Some courts may require parties to attempt mediation or some other sort of ADR prior to setting a date for trial.
Mediation uses a neutral third party to help you and your former employer come to a compromise that both of you are comfortable with. Arbitration is more like a simplified trial, with shorter discovery and less strict rules of procedure and evidence., If you do not resolve your claims through mediation or arbitration, you must go to trial. At trial, both you and your former employer will present your evidence and call witnesses to prove your side of the case. The ultimate decision of who's right and who's wrong will lie with the judge or jury."

Document the instances of bullying.,
Watch out for hostile behaviors.,
Protect yourself.,
Make reports as necessary.,
Document the outcomes of your actions.,
Take note of physical symptoms of stress.,
Obtain copies of your medical or mental health assessments.",How to Get Unemployment Due to Quitting from Bullying," In order to successfully defend yourself, it is best to gather evidence and record each event. Take note of the date, time, and place of the bullying.


Be sure to include the event and important details, such as the name of the bully, the words, actions, etc.
Take note of the specific behavior that occurred. Despite how small the event may seem, understand that it all adds up as evidence against your bully. For example, you could write, ""March 24, 2015: Around 10 A.M., I heard Vanessa Cornell training other staff on the new procedures. However, she refused to train me. When I asked for help, she told me to ""figure it out."";
, Hostile behavior could include physical or verbal abuse. Be sure to note the events, as well as the names of any witnesses that could testify for you. Defend yourself from the attack as necessary, but do so without building up evidence against yourself or giving the bully a reason to further persecute you. Be sure to immediately inform higher authorities of any instances where the bully was especially threatening (such as hitting you).

, Understand that your safety comes before your job. Although you may feel hesitant about reporting the bullying, you should not wait to report a person or event that places your safety at risk. There are several options that are available to you:


For physical violence, call the emergency services or the police.
If the bully is putting you in a hazardous work setting, contact OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration).
If you are being discriminated against because of your ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, ability, etc. you may contact the Department of Labor.
If you have a union, ask to speak with your representative. However, if they don't know how to help, move onto the union chain of command and your administrative chain of command.

, Be sure to tackle the bullying problem before it causes you to lose your job. Along with your report, include a possible solution that ensures your safety. 


If you notice a pervasive or persistent pattern of abuse towards you, that occurs over time, tell someone who is the perpetrator's superior. There's usually a boss of a boss. Even if they're in on it, as a manager or administrator, they're responsible for ensuring a safe work environment. This is where your documented notes will help you.
Take note of the higher authority's response, as well as what they agree to do in order to stop the bullying. For example, you could write, ""On April 2, 2014, I told JT that Vanessa C. was laughing at my work during the meeting. He said that he will talk to her about it this week by Thursday, and that the behavior should stop afterwards.""

, Once you take action to make the bullying stop, take note of the results. These are major contributions to your physical evidence of the bullying. These contributions will show that you attempted to take action in defending yourself rather than allowing it to occur.

, These include feeling on edge, increased irritability, inability to concentrate, inability to sleep, nausea, and vomiting. These could occur prior to having to be in the work setting where the bully works. Exhaustion, feeling tired or having low energy, depression, feelings or thoughts about wanting to harm yourself or the bully could also occur. If any of these symptoms exist, get medical attention immediately.


You may need to request that your employer send you for a worker's compensation evaluation. All you need to tell him or her is, ""I've been injured at work."" On the forms, you can summarize the contents of your notes.

For example, you could say ""I've been harassed by Vanessa C for 20 workdays. I notified my supervisor on April 2, 2014, but the behavior did not stop. I notified the supervisors again; however, I was still being verbally abused, embarrassed in front of coworkers, unfairly blamed for things I had no responsibility for, and physically threatened. As a result of all this, I am suffering symptoms of stress and anxiety. My physician believes that it's work related.""



, Keep these records to add to your physical evidence. Depending on your diagnosis and prognosis, you may be eligible for your state disability or worker's compensation insurance.


The copies of your notes, your assessment, and any copies proving the reason of your quitting can also help you make your case as to why you qualify for unemployment for quitting. They can also explain why you were unfairly terminated or laid off. The burden of proof is on you; you will need to give as much evidence as you can in order to justify why you'd qualify.

Therefore, keep your own records. No one will defend you as strongly as you will for yourself. Other items of proof are pictures and witness statements of what others saw happen to you.

Tell your supervisor first.,
Discuss how other team members will be told.Before leaving your boss’ office, confirm who will tell the entire team.,

Avoid sending a company-wide email.,
Give a consistent story.,
Finish large projects.,
Provide detailed instructions.,
Offer to work a little longer, if possible.,
Approach an exit interview warily.,
Leave the office immediately, if requested.,
Speak positively about your employer in the future.,
Create social media profiles.,
Schedule dinners or lunches to stay in touch.,
Continue mentoring relationships.",How to Give Two Weeks' Notice," You don’t want your boss to hear through the grapevine that you are leaving.Accordingly, they need to be the first person to know, even if your co-workers know that you have interviewed somewhere.


Unless you absolutely cannot stand your supervisor, you should meet in person. Keep your explanation simple and professional.For example, you can say, “Mona, I’ve accepted a new job at ABC Corp. I wanted to let you know before everybody else. I start in two weeks.”
Be sure to say how much you’ve enjoyed working there, even if you don’t mean it. You never know when you’ll cross paths with your boss again.;
, For example, your boss might want to send out a company-wide email. If so, negotiate when they will send it so you can tell some other people in person that you are leaving.

, Typically, Human Resources needs something in writing stating you are leaving your job. Ask your boss who you should address your letter of resignation to.Set up the letter like a standard business letter.


To make the letter easy to understand, state that you are resigning in the first sentence. For example: “I hereby resign as your Administrative Assistant on June 12, 2017.” This clarifies what the letter is about.
Also remember to express gratitude. Write something like, “I can’t thank you enough for giving me my first job out of college. I learned so much in the past three years that will be invaluable in my career.” Expressing gratitude helps you maintain a professional tone.

, Your letter will be put in your personnel file, so you should think strategically about the information you want to include. For example, include the following:Context for any negative information in the file. For example, if a prior supervisor criticized you, you can write, “I’m particularly grateful for how supportive the company was during the rough transition after Marina left the company in 2015. My new supervisor, Kelly Smith, has been superb.”
Your personal phone number. Tell your boss they can call you if they have questions about how something needs to be done. This shows you remain committed to doing great work.
A warm goodbye. “Best wishes and warmest regards” or something similar should strike the right tone.

, After telling your boss, you need to immediately start telling colleagues. Come up with a list in order of how important this person was to you. Close friends and mentors should be told first. You’ll need to rely on these relationships later, so you don’t want them to find out from other people.You can tell less important colleagues later, either in person or through an email.

, Some people blast the company in an email sent to everyone in the building, which is, needless to say, a terrible idea. It will follow you around to every new job where you work. Remember that your boss probably talks to other business owners, so word will get out about what you did. Furthermore, there’s tangible evidence in the form of the email, so you can’t deny it.


You should also avoid a company-wide email even if you are genuinely sad to leave. Often, these come across as sappy and insincere.A better approach is to thank people individually. Knock on their office door and talk to them for ten minutes. Express gratitude for having had the chance to work with them.

, Everyone probably want to know where you are going and why you are leaving. They also will talk to each other. For these reasons, you should tell everyone the same story.For example, don’t tell your direct supervisor you are leaving for salary reasons and then your cube mate you’re leaving because you hate your direct supervisor.
You should also give a safe answer for why you are leaving. For example, you can claim that the new job has an easier commute or that it is a better fit with your career goals.Make sure your reason is positive and that you don’t trash talk your employer.

, The worst thing you can do is dump a heap of work on the person hired to replace you (or on colleagues left behind). Accordingly, make sure that you finish up any large projects before you leave.


Another option is to time your exit just right. Finish large projects and then give your two weeks’ notice.
Also remember not to take on any new large projects during your remaining days. Instead, volunteer to find someone else who can jump in.

, If you can’t finish all your big projects ahead of time, then leave instructions for your boss about how to complete the project. Identify who on the current team can complete tasks until a new person is hired to replace you.Identify every project you are working on currently and explain what needs to be done.
You might need to offer very detailed instructions if no one on the team knows how to complete certain tasks. Also repeat that you are available by phone if someone needs to contact you.

, Two weeks might not be enough time for you to finish up important tasks and get other people up to speed. Furthermore, people in more senior positions need to give more than two weeks because of the complexity of their jobs. If possible, be flexible and tell your employer you can stay longer.Generally, the amount of notice you need to give should be equivalent to the number of vacation weeks you earn in a year.Accordingly, someone who gets four vacation weeks should probably give four weeks’ notice.
If you can’t work longer, offer to train a replacement if they’re hired in time., Some employers will hound you to do an exit interview. These interviews are supposed to be completely confidential, but often they aren’t. Instead, if you vent about anyone in the company, word could get back to them and now you’ve made an enemy.The safest option is to decline an exit interview, if possible.


If you do participate in the exit interview, offer only light constructive criticism. For example, your boss might have been too involved with team members’ personal lives. In that situation, you can say, “Karen really cared about her team, but sometimes she cared so much that she probed into people’s personal lives. I think she had the best intentions, and otherwise she was a great boss.”
Always remember to swamp any criticism you make with praise.

, Your boss might not let you work two more weeks. Instead, as soon as you give your resignation you may be shown the door. In that situation, leave without putting up a fuss. Smile at everyone on your way out and keep your chin up.This “perp walk” sometimes happens when you quit to work for a competitor or your boss thinks you might be disruptive.
To prepare for the perp walk, gather your personal belongings ahead of time so that they are in a box you can take with you. Research ahead of time what you can take and what you can’t take.
If you used a company cell phone for personal matters, make sure you’ve removed the personal material before turning over the phone.

, You should never bad mouth a previous employer, even after you’ve left the position. Only speak positively about your colleagues, boss, and the company itself.Try to maintain the same story to explain why you left. If you told your boss you left for more advancement opportunities, then that should be your story for the future.

, Although you’re leaving a job, you don’t want to completely sever all relationships. Nowadays, most people stay in touch through social media. Create a LinkedIn or Google+ profile.


If you already have profiles, make sure they are updated to reflect your new job., You should have a face-to-face meeting with important colleagues and mentors about two months after you leave.This will allow you to catch up and continue your relationship into the future.


Remember not to gossip, even though you no longer work at the company.

, Mentoring doesn’t end when you leave a company. Instead, your mentor can continue to advise you about your career long after you’ve moved on. Schedule regular meetings. You can also join professional organizations where you might get to work side-by-side with your mentor.


You should also maintain relationships with any mentees. At some point, they will move up in the profession and be at a point where they can help you in your own career. Accordingly, you want to maintain these relationships.

Consider your situation.,
Document all incidents of harassment.,
Ignore the harasser.,
Set limits.,
Avoid being alone with the harasser.,
Ask your friends to stick up for you.,
Take care of yourself outside of work.",How to Stop a Harassing Co Worker1," Separate your emotions from the facts and think about your harasser. Is this a personality conflict? Does your behavior contribute anything to this situation? Be sure you are, in fact, dealing with a harassment situation before proceeding with further action.


Workplace harassment is defined as, ""unwelcome conduct that is based on race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability or genetic information. Harassment becomes unlawful where 1) enduring the offensive conduct becomes a condition of continued employment, or 2) the conduct is severe or pervasive enough to create a work environment that a reasonable person would consider intimidating, hostile, or abusive.""Remember that a workplace is a professional environment. People may not always be nice when they ask you to get work done or when they offer criticism on a project. While that may not be great workplace etiquette, it is not harassment.If you are experiencing ongoing threats, offensive jokes, physical assaults or threat of assault, slurs, mockery, putdowns, or interference with work performance, the behavior may be considered harassment. Isolated incidents are not usually considered harassment, but should be documented and reported as necessary.For example, a comment on your work, such as “You did a terrible job on this project. I can’t believe we hired you,” is poorly conveyed but not harassment. Harassment would be insulting who you are as a person on an ongoing basis, for example, “Hardly surprising a dumb woman would screw this up.”
You can learn more about workplace harassment here: https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/harassment.cfm
;
, Record every encounter you have with your harasser. Include date, time, and the nature of the encounter. Be sure to indicate any witnesses that may have seen the incident.For example, your harasser bullies you at a job site. You could record: “March 3, 11 AM: John tells me to ‘go back to my own country’ at Main Street project. Witnesses: Alice, Sam, and Jaime.”
Make sure you record the incidents on a document that is not accessible to the harasser. For example, you may want to use your home computer, a password protected file on your personal mobile phone, or on a paper you keep in your car. Having multiple copies is advisable.
Use your documentation to provide evidence for your case against your harasser to your supervisor or human resources. It can also be helpful for you to go back over these documents a day or two later and decide if what you experienced was truly harassment.
Ask any witnesses who saw the harassment to write their own perception of the encounter. You could say, “Marie, would you mind jotting down what you saw between Manuel and me in the hallway? Could you give me a copy of it when you’re done? I want to keep track of all of these incidents.”

, At first, you may wish to try to see if the harassment will stop if you ignore the person. It may help you prove your case that you are doing nothing to provoke the person. If the harasser starts to bother you, you may try pretending you didn’t hear them, walking away, or turning your back to the person.


If the harasser does not get a reaction from you, they may not be encouraged to continue their behavior. Think about a child not getting a rise out of their sibling, and then stopping the annoying behavior.
If the harasser starts bothering you in the break room, for example, you could leave, take your lunch and eat it at your desk. If they start bothering you while you’re working at your desk, you could put on a pair of noise-canceling headphones while they are harassing you.

, Confront your harasser and let them know their behavior is unacceptable. Be professional and firm.While it can be difficult, keep your emotions in check when you confront your harasser. They will likely use your emotions against you. Remain calm and firm. It may be helpful to you to rehearse what you say to your harasser beforehand.You could say, “Rick, talking to me like that is unacceptable. Please stop.”
You could say, “Quit following me and saying offensive things to provoke me. Your behavior is inappropriate in any setting, but especially in an office.”
If possible, walk away from the harasser after you state your objection to their behavior. Do not allow them to draw you into a discussion about the behavior. You can simply state, ""I've said all that I wish to say"" and walk away or put on headphones.

, Make sure you are always around other people who can witness the harasser’s behavior. Ask your supervisor for tasks that don’t require you to be alone with the harasser. Ask to be reassigned to a different team if necessary.


You could say, “I have been having some ongoing conflicts with Spencer. I noticed that Steve’s team has an opening right now. Would it be possible for me to get reassigned?”
If they follow you into a room in which you are alone, try to either leave or make sure the door remains wide open.

, Build a support network of friendly coworkers who can help protect you from the harassment as well as be witnesses to any incidents that may occur. Ask your coworkers to be alert for any incidents of harassment against others as well.You could say, “Debbie, would you mind sitting with me in the lunchroom today? If Casey says anything to me, I would like to have you witness the incident.”
Ask coworkers to stand up against the harasser on your behalf. You could say, “Tom, if you hear Jenny telling racist jokes around me again, can you please ask her to stop?”

, Find ways to manage your stress and emotions in healthy ways when you off the clock. Try not to let your work life bleed into your personal life.Eat well, sleep well, and exercise. Staying physically healthy will benefit your mental health.
Do activities you enjoy that help you feel good about yourself and destress.
Spend time with caring family and friends.
Try journaling about your feelings. This can be an excellent way to process your thoughts and emotions and brainstorm about possible solutions. You could even write exactly what you'd like to say to your harasser.
Consider counseling to help you deal with difficult emotions and trauma that you may be experiencing in the face of your harassment.

Educate yourself on your rights and workplace protocol.,
Approach your supervisor first.,
Take your concerns to your human resources representative.",How to Stop a Harassing Co Worker2," Before addressing your concerns with your supervisor or at a higher level in your organization, take the time to familiarize yourself with the rules, policies, and procedures in place. Come into meetings with higher-ups informed and ready to advocate for yourself.Read over your employee manual, union materials (if you are represented by a union), and employment laws in your state and country.
You may wish to consult an attorney or anyone you know who works in human resources. They should be well-versed on your rights in this area and may help you decide how to proceed.
Bring copies of pertinent policies to share with your supervisor or other management.

, Follow the appropriate chain of command in your organization. Ask to speak to your supervisor privately and in person about your concern.


You could say, “Jim, do you have time to meet this afternoon? I have something I need to discuss with you privately.”
Tell your supervisor about your problem and ask how they will address the situation. You could say, “What will you do to solve this problem with Melanie? Please follow up with me when you’ve taken action. If I don’t hear from you in a few days, I am going to follow up with you about it again.”
Show your supervisor a copy of your harassment record.
If your harasser is your supervisor, go to their supervisor. If you have a human resources representative, you may also wish to talk to them first instead., You may choose to take your concerns to human resources, if your employer has a designated department. You may also feel more comfortable talking to human resources instead of your supervisor. Be sure you following your company’s protocol, unless there are extenuating circumstances that prevent you from following it (for example, your boss is harassing you).


Your HR rep will likely begin by meeting with you confidentially. They may provide you with coping strategies and suggestions for handling the harassment.Describe the situation to your HR rep, making sure you provide a written record of all of the documented instances of harassment. You could say, “For the past few weeks, Bob White in IT has started insulting me whenever he sees me. I started to make a list of all the incidents. I believe his behavior meets the definition of harassment.”
Make a list of any questions you might have and bring them to the meeting. This meeting can be emotional and you may be nervous and forget everything you want to say. Bringing a list of what you'd like to address during the meeting can help ensure that all your questions are answered.
Depending on the severity of what you have described, the HR rep may be compelled by law to open an investigation. If not, they may offer to meet with your harasser alone or with you present."
"
File a complaint.,
Talk to your union representative.,
Hire an attorney.,
Look for another job.",How to Stop a Harassing Co Worker3," If you do not feel your employer has resolved this issue to your satisfaction, and you believe your harassment is discriminatory in nature, you can file a complaint (called a Charge of Discrimination) with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) if you live in the United States. You must file your report within certain time limits, depending on the state in which you live and the nature of your complaint.The EEOC may investigate your complaint and suggest you begin a mediation process to solve the problem with your employer.
The EEOC may open a formal investigation of your complaint. Depending on the nature of your complaint and federal, state, and local laws, they may find that you have the right to sue your employer for discrimination. They may also attempt to work toward a settlement with your employer on your behalf.
The EEOC may not find your employer to be in violation of any laws and may decline to intervene in your case.

, If you are represented by a union in your workplace, talk to your union representative about the union’s ability to stand up to your workplace harassment with you. The union’s obligation and protocol will be spelled out in your union and employer’s collective bargaining agreement.Your union can help you demand that your employer take action to protect you from harassment, as well as help you protect yourself from the harasser.The union can help you file a grievance with your employer if your harasser is in management.If the harasser is a fellow union member, the union can help investigate the harassment, warn the harasser to stop, and/or file a grievance on your behalf to management for their failure to deal with the problem., You may wish to contact an attorney who specializes in employment law who can help you figure out what steps you would like to take against your employer. The attorney could provide a consultation that will help you determine if you have a case, as well as the type of action you would like to take against your employer.


Ask family or friends for attorney recommendations, or look online for attorneys near you. Meet with a few to determine the best fit for your needs and budget.

, You may wish to look for another job if your work environment does not improve after repeated conversations with your supervisors and/or your employer’s human resources department. Staying in a stressful harassment situation can damage your mental and physical health.Ask your employer for a positive recommendation. You could say, “As I followed appropriate workplace protocol for reporting this harassment, and continued to complete my work successfully in spite of a difficult work environment, I would appreciate a positive letter of recommendation and reference for my next employer.”
Avoid mentioning the harassment when interviewing with prospective employers. While it is unfair, you may be seen as a difficult employee if you have brought charges of harassment to the attention of your previous employer. If you are asked in an interview why you are leaving your current position, you could say, “I’m looking for new challenges and see this position as an opportunity for my professional growth.”If you suspect your former employer is giving you a bad recommendation, you may be able to do damage control. You can call HR at your old company and explain that you feel your boss is retaliating after your claims of harassment. Many companies now have policies about references — simply confirming that you worked there and the dates of employment — as bad references can sometimes lead to lawsuits.
You can also send a ""cease and desist"" letter to the CEO or HR department stating the name of the person who gave the bad reference, suggesting they simply confirm your title and dates of employment. They may fear that you are going to pursue legal action and the behavior will most likely stop."

Watch how the person treats your personal space.,
Observe whether the person finds reasons to be around you.,
See if your coworker is looking at you.,
Look at the person’s body language.,
Notice if your coworker compliments you a lot.,
Evaluate what your coworker talks to you about.,
Ask your coworker about your relationship.,
Learn about your company’s policies regarding relationships in the office.,
Avoid anything that could be construed as sexual harassment.,
Don't make assumptions.",How to Know if a Coworker Has a Crush on You," Make sure to observe how the person treats your personal space. If a coworker has a crush on you, they may move into your personal space more than if they had no feelings for you.


Does the person move into your person space in a warm and non-threatening manner? They may want to get close to you or to show you affection.
Observe to see if your coworker enters your personal space to touch you on the shoulder, touch your hair, touch or pat your arm, or bump into you repeatedly.
Always observe how people treat others around you before making a judgement about someone having a crush on you.
Beware not to confuse “close talkers” or other people who don’t understand or respect personal space with people who have feelings for you.;
, Another great nonverbal way to figure out if a coworker has a crush on you is to consider whether they go out of their way to be around you. If they do, it might be a sign that they’ve got a crush on you.


If someone has no useful or practical reason to be around you, yet they always are, they might have feelings for you
If someone is around you a lot, but is around you out of necessity, they might not have feelings for you., Spend a little time and try to observe if your coworker looks at you a lot. Mixed with other signals, looking at you may represent the fact that they have a crush on you. Your coworker may have a crush on you if:


They steal glances at you throughout the day for no apparent reason.
They stare at you, wink, or otherwise invite your interest with their eyes during meetings or other occasions at work.
They check your physical features out regularly., Body language is very important in determining if your coworker has a crush on you. By paying attention to your coworker’s body language, you’ll get some important clues as to how they feel about you.


Is your coworker standing in a way that is inviting or relaxed? If they’re arms and legs are open and their posture is relaxed, they might be interested in you.
Does your coworker send signals that they are closed off from you? If they stand with arms crossed or withdrawn, they could either be nervous or not interested in you at all.
Always evaluate body language in conjunction with other signs and signals that the person sends to you., Think about whether your coworker compliments you a lot. Compliments or other positive remarks might indicate that they have a high opinion of you or even a crush on you.


If your coworker consistently compliments the job you’re doing at work, it might mean that they just respect you as a coworker.
If your coworker compliments your physical looks or other things that are not related to work, it might mean that they have romantic interest in you.
Don’t take compliments by themselves as an indication of your coworker having a crush. Evaluate compliments in the context of other factors., The subject of your conversations with your coworker can give you pretty solid cues about their feelings for you. As a result, pay a little attention to what your coworker says to you and the types of conversations they initiate. Ask yourself:


Does your coworker bring up highly personal information? If so, this might signal that they see you as more than just an acquaintance.
Does your coworker talk sex, being intimate, or romantic interests? This might be a way of getting your attention in a romantic way.
Does your coworker confide in you? This suggests that they see you as more than just a coworker.
Does your coworker invite you to activities outside of work? This could be a sure sign they’re interested in you romantically., After watching for other signals, you might just need to plain out ask your coworker if they have a crush on you. While this might not be the easiest or the most comfortable thing to do, it may get the results you want.


Say something like “do you think our relationship goes beyond work?”
If you don’t want to be direct, try using humor to offset your question. Perhaps make a joke about how other employees avoid you, then say “you don’t seem to hate me like everyone else.”
Be careful about suggesting you want more than a work relationship., Before even engaging in activity to find out if your coworker has a crush on you, you need to figure out what your company’s policies are regarding workplace romances. This is important even if you don’t want a relationship, because even the rumor of two people being involved could cause problems.


Check your employee handbook, if you have one, for policies on workplace relationships.
Talk to a human resource representative, if you can’t find information elsewhere.
Tell your superiors if you begin a formal, mutually-recognized relationship., When trying to find out if your coworker has a crush, you need to make sure that you avoid any conversation or activity that may be construed as sexual harassment. This is a very tough thing to do, as different people may be sensitive to this subject and could identify what you think is a harmless comment as something much more.


Never make a blatantly sexual or romantic comment to anyone you are not in a formal, mutually-recognized relationship with.
Don’t touch other employees unless invited to do so, and never do so at work in a sexual or romantic way even if you are in a mutually-recognized relationship.
If you think someone has a crush on you, and you’re uncomfortable letting them know you’re not interested, consider contacting human resources.
If someone makes unwanted advances toward you despite your signals to stop, contact management or human resources immediately., Perhaps the most important thing to do when trying to determine if a coworker has a crush on you, is to avoid making assumptions. By making assumptions, you'll jump to conclusions about things without being properly informed. When you do this, you may do something or say something that could get you into trouble or hurt someone else’s feelings.


Make sure you always have the correct information when making a decision about what to do.
Don’t treat someone differently because you think they have a crush on you.
Don’t expect a date, sexual favors, or anything of the sort from someone you think has a crush on you."

Continue to file for unemployment.",How to Get Unemployment After Quitting a Job," Each state defines “good cause” differently. Accordingly, the only way you can know for sure whether you qualify is if you research your state’s law. You should contact your state’s unemployment agency and ask if the reason why you want to quit qualifies.


You can find a link to your state’s office at the federal government’s Career Onestop website: http://www.careeronestop.org/localhelp/unemploymentbenefits/unemployment-benefits.aspx.
Click on your state.;
, There are some work-related reasons that justify quitting your job and will count as “good cause.” For example, the following might qualify, depending on your state:unsafe work conditions, such as dangerous equipment
a transfer to work that isn’t suitable for you
a permanent change in your terms of employment, including lower pay or fewer hours
unlawful harassment or discrimination, including sexual, racial, and other harassment

, Some reasons for quitting your job might be more personal in nature. For example, the following personal reasons qualify in many states as good cause for leaving a job:your health has declined (though in some states your illness must be job-related)you left a job for another job, which never materialized
union rules
lack of transportation (in some situations)
taking care of a sick family member
domestic violence
leave to handle urgent, unforeseen child care arrangements

, In some states, you are required to try and resolve issues with your employer before quitting. If you don’t, then you won’t be eligible for unemployment benefits because your state won’t find “good cause” for quitting.For example, if you find the equipment is unsafe, you can ask your employer to upgrade the equipment or provide safety devices like goggles.
Basically, you should show that quitting was your last choice.
However, you generally don’t need to work around the issue if you quit because of harassment, discrimination, or domestic violence.

, If you are quitting for personal reasons, then some states might require that you try to get a leave of absence that will allow you to handle the issue before returning to work. Even if your employer won’t agree, you should still ask.For example, if your mother is sick, you should try to get a leave of absence before quitting your job. If you don’t, then your state might find that you don’t have “good cause.”
You don’t need to ask for leave if you are quitting due to harassment, discrimination, or domestic violence.

, Only a qualified attorney can answer your question whether you have good cause under your state law. An attorney can also help you put together the strongest case for when you apply for unemployment. You should get a referral to an attorney and schedule a consultation.


Money might be tight. However, you could ask the attorney if you can pay for a half-hour of advice.
You might also qualify for legal aid if your income is less than 125% of the federal poverty level.For example, a single person would qualify for legal aid if they had an annual income of $14,850. For a family of three, the maximum is $25,200.You can find the nearest legal aid office by visiting the Legal Services Corporation’s website at http://www.lsc.gov/. Click on “Find Legal Aid” and enter your address.

, If you are quitting because the job is dangerous, then you should be able to point to specific hazards. For example, the equipment might be old or the building might lack proper ventilation. Try to get the following evidence:


Take pictures of any hazards. For example, if there are holes in the floor or dangerous sparks caused by equipment, you can take pictures or video.
Get a copy of any complaint form that you filed with OSHA or an equivalent state agency.

, If you have to quit for medical reasons, then you should get a letter from your doctor. Get the letter if you have to quit because of your own poor health or because you need to take care of a family member. The letter should generally contain the following information:identification of the health problem
what activities you shouldn’t do at work because of the health issue
how the job affects your health
whether you should continue in your current job
the types of work you can do in spite of your current health condition

, If you are quitting because of domestic violence, then you should ideally already have in place a restraining order (also called a “protective order”). Find your copy of the protective order because it is excellent evidence that you have been harassed.


If you haven’t yet filed for a protective order, then you should do so promptly.
See Get a Protective Order for more information.

, You can expect your employer to challenge any claim that you experienced harassment or discrimination at work. For this reason, you should gather as much evidence as possible. For example, look for the following:


Any communication that is abusive, including emails, letters, notes, and voicemail recordings.
Names of witnesses who observed the harassment.
Your own written recollections. Try to be as detailed as possible. Write down who harassed you, as well as where and when.Copies of any grievances filed with your boss or other complaints made. It helps if you can show that you let your employer know of the abusive behavior.

, Find your state’s unemployment office and apply. They should provide a phone number you can call or a link to the site where you can apply.If you have questions, look for a phone number and call.


It’s important to apply right away. You shouldn’t delay.

, After you apply, the office will review your information and then decide whether you qualify. Since you quit your job, you shouldn’t be surprised if you get a denial letter. This letter should tell you how to request a hearing.


In some states, the unemployment office might just go ahead and schedule a hearing. In their letter, they will tell you the date, time, and location. In many states, the hearing will be held by telephone.If you can’t make the hearing, then you should call as soon as possible to reschedule.

, You can have witnesses testify for you at the hearing.For example, if you are taking care of a sick relative, then they could speak over the phone.


You can also collect relevant documents and put them in some kind of logical order.
If your hearing is by phone, you will probably have to fax your documents or mail them to the unemployment office ahead of time.

, You must explain to the unemployment representative that quitting was the only reasonable thing to do.You should try to write out a couple paragraphs explaining your situation.


Practice explaining your situation to a friend or family member. You don’t want to memorize what you will say. However, you want to be sufficiently familiar with the facts of your case so that you can answer questions comfortably.

, Your employer has the option of contesting your application for unemployment benefits. In particular, your employer will probably challenge that your work environment was harassing. You should take some time to think about what your employer will say.


Also consider your response. For example, an employer might argue that you weren’t harassed on the job by your coworkers. However, your employer might not have worked anywhere near you and your coworkers. You can point that out.

, Whether the hearing is held in person or over the telephone, you should be sure that you are not late. Have your supporting evidence with you to look at. If you want witnesses to testify for you, then make sure that they arrive at least 15 minutes early.


The initial hearing might not be recorded, but the person running it should come up with a hearing report. You should try to review the report and correct any mistakes., You also have the right to an appeal. You should read your denial letter or check with your state’s unemployment agency for details on how to appeal.You only have a limited amount of time, so don’t delay.The unemployment agency will hold another hearing. However, this hearing might be more formal than the initial hearing.
Be sure to talk with an attorney in order to prepare for your appeal. Each state’s appeal process is somewhat different, so only an attorney can provide tailored advice.

, At the hearing, the person running it (called the “referee” or something similar) will tell you the procedure and also start recording the hearing. You should remember the following tips:Arrive early. You and your witnesses should arrive at least 15 minutes ahead of time.
Answer questions honestly and fully. However, don’t guess. If you don’t know the answer, say, “I can’t remember” or “I don’t know.”
Remain calm. You will appear more credible if you don’t lose your temper.
Avoid talking until the referee tells you it is your turn to talk.

, Depending on your state, you might be able to bring more appeals if you lose the initial one. Your denial letter should tell you whether additional appeals are available.


For example, in Connecticut, if you lose your appeal you can appeal to the Board of Review and then bring an appeal in court.Always remember your deadlines. States set strict deadlines which you must meet whenever filing for an appeal.

, You need to file for unemployment even if you are initially denied. In fact, you should continue to file until you receive a rejection on your very last appeal.If you win your appeal, then you will be paid unemployment benefits for each week that you filed. If you didn’t file as you waited for your appeal, you won’t get any of that money owed to you.

Listen to your coworker.,
Be polite.,
Explain yourself.,
Use “I” statements.,
Offer an alternative.",How to Say No to a Coworker1," Even if you know that you are going to say when a coworker approaches you, it is respectful hear them out. Being rude only builds enemies. Let your coworker finish talking before making your response.After they are done talking, allow a respectful pause to follow before giving a polite “no.”;
, There is no reason for you to be rude to your coworker. You are already telling them “no,” which is hard enough for most people to hear. Apologizing for not being able to help your coworker is polite, and so is smiling and having a good attitude.You can try statements like, “I’m so sorry that I couldn’t help you this time.”

, An extension of being polite is explaining why you are saying no. You don’t have to give an explanation, but doing so helps the other person not feel quite so disappointed or upset. Giving an explanation may also ensure that you will continue to have a pleasant work environment.Avoid lying in your explanation. Tell your coworker the real reason you can’t help them. Making up prior engagements or projects that don’t exist does not respect your coworker. This also ruins your credibility and damages your reputation.
Say something like, “I really can’t help with that project today because of a prior engagement I scheduled after work.”

, In order to prevent your coworker from feeling further upset, make sure you make your refusal all about yourself. Say things like, “I’m sorry I can’t help. It’s my fault that I’m behind on this other project that prevents me from having time to help you.” Keeping your refusal limited to things that are your responsibility can prevent your coworker from getting angry.


Don’t tell your coworker that they are lazy or that it’s their fault they need help now.

, Since you can’t help today, maybe you can help another day. Offer your coworker alternatives to the request they have made if it doesn’t fit your time schedule. For example, if they help today but you aren’t free from a current project until Friday, offer to help them on Friday. Alternatives can feel like less of a refusal and make you look like you are still interested in helping.Truly intend to help in the different way that you offer as an alternative—don’t just make up alternatives to put a coworker off.
You can say, “Are you flexible about the deadline? I can help tomorrow, but I can’t today.”
If you don't really want to help the coworker, then don't offer alternative. Stick to being polite, saying no, and offering a short explanation.

Expect them to become angry.,
Remain calm.,
Understand that you may be burning a bridge.,
Process the interaction with an objective third party.",How to Say No to a Coworker2," Any time that you give a negative answer, you should prepare yourself for a negative response. Expecting your coworker to be disappointed or even angry that you said “no” will prevent you from being surprised by their response.It is important to maintain civil reactions to other coworkers even when they are aggressive toward you, so that there is no violence in the workplace.

, If your coworker becomes upset, remain calm. Do not react to them in the same way that they are acting toward you. Staying calm can also diffuse a situation. When someone gets upset, other people acting the same way adds fuel to the fire.


Practice things to stay calm like speaking slowly or even removing yourself from the room.

, Keep in mind that sometimes, people are not understanding when others say no, and they may be giving you an ultimatum. If you say no to a coworker, they may be so upset that they won’t ever be willing to work with you again. Decide ahead of time that you are OK with this.


If you know that saying no to a particular coworker will mean losing the relationship, decide how you will react to this. Will you let it go without discussing it further, or will you tell someone like your supervisor or boss what happened? If you find that you don't want to burn the bridge, perhaps you should work with the coworker to find a way to help them that works better for you.

, After you have finished an interaction where you had to say no to coworker and they reacted negatively, find someone to talk to about it. This will help you understand their reaction so that you can do your part to not make them angry in the future.


Sometimes you can’t help the way people react, and you have to be OK with them getting upset.
Find an objective third party, like an HR rep, a coworker in another department, or even someone at home. The goal is to find someone who will not gossip about it and spread rumors at work.

Determine if the request is unethical.,
Decide if the request is beyond your time constraints.,
Make sure that you can’t help.",How to Say No to a Coworker3," One reason you might want to say no to a coworker is because their request is unethical. Perhaps a coworker has fallen behind on a project and they want you to cut a few corners to get the project in on time. Whatever the reason, if it is going to break rules, it’s OK to say no.Other unethical requests include asking you to do more than your share on a project, to cover up their failure to perform a task, or to keep silent about an issue you know is wrong.

, Another reason you may say no to a coworker is because they want your help when you are trying to focus on another project. In this case, saying no makes sense, and it is easy to offer your help at another time when you aren’t working on this project.You may need to say no permanently if you are working on prioritizing projects and this coworker keeps asking you to work on things outside your immediate job description.

, Before saying no to a reasonable request by a coworker, make sure that you can’t help them. It is embarrassing to say no because you didn’t think about it and then decide that you can help them after all. Take your time looking at your schedule and weighing the pros and cons before answering your coworker.

Recognize your audience.,
Be a little bit cranky right at the beginning -- it can work wonders.,
Evaluate the context.,
Look for an easy way out.,
Keep your cool.,
Google it!,
When in doubt, talk it out!","How to Respond to ""Clever"" Forwarded E Mails"," If the email in question came from someone who sends two or three of these things a week (you know who you are!), then don't invest too much into the response. Etiquette and classical learning theory dictate that unless you truly find the item interesting or amusing, you shouldn't reply at all.



 ;
, When you get the first time-wasting email from someone, send them back a polite email saying, ""Please take me off your joke forwarding list. I don't have time right now to read jokes, inspirational messages, etc., and I'm worried that I might overlook your important emails."" The person will email back in a huff saying that:


a) they thought you'd enjoy it;






b) they rarely send this kind of thing, but this one was really funny.






However, they will think twice about doing it again, and if they do, just repeat your response, using the same language as before. If you don't mind being firm, you'll cut your junk email down considerably. But you must use self-control and never admit that anything was funny, or that you even read it, or they'll start right back up again. And obviously, YOU must never send junk emails if you don't want to receive them from others. But if you do want to respond ...






, Was this email forwarded to you for any particular reason? If so, a prompt and personalized response is key. This step is particularly important as a failure to respond to a early-April email forward spurred by a conversation in late January could result in hurt feelings.

, Oftentimes, email forwards have their own built-in responses: simply pick a point mentioned in the text. Copy, paste, sign, send - and you're done! Never forget an extraneous exclamation point, to prove your enthusiasm and gratitude. (An alternative to this method is mentioning your favorite part of the email forward.)

, Semi-funny email forwards can be amusing, but they're never quite necessary. Keep this in mind, and you already have the upper-hand - you are cooler than the sender (who went out of his/her way to placate you with said whimsical nugget)., If you still haven't managed to formulate an appropriate response, try Googling the title of the email. Most likely, you'll find a related topic that may spark a great come-back., Still can't think of anything? Nothing seems right? How about you approach the sender in person and follow up? No doubt your facial expressions and body language will make up for the marked lack of cleverness. A pat on the back, though, might be taking it too far."
"
Keep conversations light.,
Arrange to socialize during your breaks.,
Avoid being the office gossip, and stay away from those that are.,
Be more of a listener than a talker.,
Excel in your position.,
Show respect for your superiors even if they do not extend the same courtesy to you.",How to Get Along With Co Workers1," While you want to appear friendly and warm, certain topics should be avoided if you want to escape conflict at work.


For example, discussions about religion and politics are generally inappropriate at work, and can end up heated. Also avoid overly personal conversations like your health, sexuality, personal relationship problems, or finances, and avoid asking your co-workers about these issues as well.If you feel uncomfortable with nosy or invasive inquiries into your personal life, or if the topic of conversation becomes controversial, do your best to change the subject. If that fails, you can either firmly but politely shut them down or try to leave the discussion diplomatically. Its often enough to firmly say, ""I'd really rather not discuss that particular issue at work."" If you'd rather not be so forward, try saying, ""Oh! I just remembered something I need to finish,"" and then excuse yourself from the conversation.;
, Socializing excessively during work hours sends a message to your boss that you are not a serious worker, and encourages chatty colleagues to eat up your time.


If a work colleague tries to chat with you while you are busy, suggest you postpone the conversation until lunchtime. Try to be diplomatic so that your work colleague does not feel rejected.
For example, you could say something like, ""I totally agree. I am so swamped, but I'd love to talk more at lunch. Do you want to meet up?""

, Gossiping and complaining among your co-workers often leads to some form of hostility between peers and superiors.It is best to remain silent or walk away when you hear your co-workers gossip, but if you can't, try reframing the gossip in a positive light.For instance, if your co-worker says, ""Did you hear that Jamie got a raise and Ken didn't?"" you might say something like, ""Jamie definitely worked hard this year for that raise. She deserves it!""
Remember that co-workers who gossip about one another or about the boss likely also gossip about you when you're not around. Try not to give these type of people personal details about your life that you don't want spread around the office.

, Not only will you learn more about your co-workers, but you will avoid saying the wrong thing.


Staying quiet will also help you avoid the stigma of being the chatty one in the office, or worse, being perceived as a gossip.Bite your tongue in particular if you tend to be quick-witted, sarcastic, or tongue-in-cheek, which can come across as rude to co-workers who don't appreciate your sense of humor.

, If you do your best when completing your own work, your superiors will see your dedication and know that any conflicts in the workplace are not your fault.


Make yourself indispensable by doing an exceptional job at your tasks. This will also keep you busy and help you avoid conflicts with troubling colleagues.
Go out of your way to help your co-workers. If you help your co-workers achieve their goals by relieving their stress, then they will see you as an ally. This does not mean that you do your co-worker's job in addition to your own. But if you see an area where they could use help and you have additional time on your hands, consider offering to lend support.

, Sometimes, the co-worker with whom you have the most friction is your own boss.


Don't allow negative attitudes or heavy demands from your managers upset you. If you want pleasant co-worker relationships, then you will need to realize that people behave a certain way for their own reasons and there is nothing you can do about it. Be the better person by returning negative behavior with polite, respectful responses.
If your boss's negative behavior exceeds acceptable limits-- if he or she harasses, discriminates, or otherwise illegally targets you-- see your company's human resources office for steps you can take to stop the behavior. In a small office with no HR department, your next recourse might be to hire a lawyer.

"
"
Look at yourself.,
Get to know your co-workers as people.,
Go out of your way to be kind.",How to Get Along With Co Workers2," In any conflict situation, everyone involved tends to believe the situation is the other party's fault. Consider whether there is anything you could do differently to improve your working relationship.Do you have an aggressive personality? Sometimes you might come on too strong, and others might react by withdrawing or becoming defensive, even if you meant well. Try toning it down or giving them some space.
Do you tend to be critical? Even if it's part of your job, the way a person offers criticism can feel constructive or like a personal attack. Some people with more sensitive personalities may receive all but the most gentle criticism this way.
Don't be afraid to take the responsibility for a conflict, and make it right. Use ""I statements"" to deflect potential defensiveness, like ""I may have overstepped my role"" or ""I am afraid I may have come across too harshly with my criticism."", Learning more about their interests, backgrounds, and families can help to relieve some of the conflict by helping you understand their personality, goals, and priorities.Invite them over to your home for a barbeque, or to a bar or restaurant after work. You can get to know them free of the stress of the workplace, and help them to see you as a three dimensional person with a life outside of work.
Remember that negative and conflict-ridden people are often under a lot of stress. They may be fighting a medical condition, struggling to pay their bills, or dealing with family issues. Extend the same benefit of the doubt that you would hope someone would extend to you on a bad day.
Be considerate of your co-worker's personal boundaries, and don't be offended if they choose not to get close. They may decline invitations or prefer to keep their work relationships strictly professional, and that's ok too.

, You might not be best friends with all your co-workers, but you can make a special effort to be kind, polite, and easy to work with.Never engage in behaviors that are considered harassment, such as making suggestive sexual comments or gestures or telling jokes that target race, culture, or gender.Consider leaving notes of appreciation for your co-workers, or bringing in donuts to the office once a month. When it's reasonable and does not add to your work load, help your co-workers out in little ways: grab their copies off the copy machine, offer to take orders for Starbucks if you're headed there anyway, or refill the soap dispenser. The little things can add up to a much more enjoyable working relationship.
Going out of your way to be kind doesn't mean letting others walk all over you or letting others take advantage of your helpfulness. It just means treating everyone the same at work regardless of whether they are your favorite or least favorite person to work with.

Recognize personality conflicts.,
Talk to your co-workers.,
Stand up for a co-worker who is being harassed or bullied.,
Keep records of workplace incidents.,
Know your rights.",How to Get Along With Co Workers3," Sometimes, no matter how hard you try, you just can't get along with certain personalities that conflict with your own.


Avoid a problem co-worker. If you tend to run into the same conflicts with the same person day after day, consider making slight changes to your schedule so that you do not run into him or her at the typical times (such as during the morning elevator ride, coffee breaks, or lunch periods in common areas).If possible, ask to move desks or teams. This should be a last resort because you don't want to seem to be a person who is hard to work with.
If you can't avoid them outright, avoid the conflict by ignoring it. Bullies often target people to get a reaction, so if you don't react, you might find that he or she will leave you alone., If you are having a conflict or misunderstanding, your first step of action should be a calm, one-on-one discussion.Conduct the conversation in private, keep your emotions and tone of voice calm, and only discuss facts rather than opinions or feelings. Begin with the attitude that you want to seek solutions and improve workplace productivity, not to prove a point or redress personal grievances.Be direct but non-accusatory. Don't say, ""You have been mean to me this week. I saw you rolling your eyes during my presentation this morning. What's your deal?"" Instead make the issue something both of you can fix: ""There seems to be some tension between us. I noticed you rolled your eyes while I was pitching my idea this morning at the meeting. Is there anything I've done? How can we fix this?""
You may find that your co-worker has a rational explanation for the conflict, such as a misunderstanding or something they overheard in the break room. In this case, try to remedy the solution through appropriate explanations or apologies, and then try to work together to keep your work relationship professional in the future.

, Unfortunately, workplace conflict often seems juvenile and can veer into the realm of teasing, taunting, or discrimination. These behaviors are illegal.Just as you would advise your children to do with a playground bully, consider your options: stand up to the bully and confront him or her, change the subject or redirect the bully's attention, or find help from a superior to intervene on your co-workers behalf.

, If you are being harassed, bullied, or just sense that a conflict at work is escalating, it is a great idea to keep a detailed log of all the interactions with that person.This log can be used as evidence if the conflict ends up being taken to management. Write down dates, times, and actions or words that your employee engaged in. Avoid emotional or overly descriptive language; just stick to the facts., You have the right to a workplace free of harassment and bullying. As a last resort, you may consider reporting a co-worker's behavior to management.


Ensure that company policy and/or your rights are being violated before acting. Check your employee handbook and the harassment policy of the U.S. Equal Opportunity Commission (http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/harassment.cfm). Generally, according to the EEOC, ""petty slights, annoyances, and isolated incidents… will not rise to the level of illegality. To be unlawful, the conduct must create a work environment that would be intimidating, hostile, or offensive to reasonable people.""Check the sections of your company handbook regarding employee behavior,which will typically point you toward your company's chain of command to report the situation. Depending on your company, this may be your direct manager or the Office of Human Resources.
Be sure to handle the report professionally. Begin the conversation with an explanation such as, ""I had hoped to avoid involving you, but a situation with a co-worker has gotten to a point that I feel we need to have a conversation.""Avoid coming across as emotional, vindictive, or accusatory. Explain only the facts of the situation-- who did what and when."
"
Create a buffer.,
Recognize accidents.,
Appreciate other cultures.,
Consider the environment.,
Ignore the issue.,
Document the interaction.,
Be cognizant of your status.",How to Get a Coworker to Respect Your Personal Space1," Use your natural office environment to separate yourself from someone else. Be sure to use natural cubicle dividers and desks to get more room. Stand nearer to larger objects like water coolers so there is less angle to approach you.;
, If you feel the personal space violation was due to clumsiness or a simple mistake, simply dismiss the situation. It’s far too easy to become defensive about a situation that was completely incidental or unintentional., If there is a diverse environment at your office, it’s likely some people find touching to be a valid form of expression, a means of connection and communication. It is probably how they talk to their friends and family. If it's not inappropriate (a tap on the shoulder, a pat on the back) and if it's not bothering you, you may choose to accept their invasion of your space.

, If you are forced into a closely grouped situation, realize its innocuous nature. Places like elevators and group meetings often result in people being within closer proximity to one another., Unless the touch is inappropriate, it may be best to chalk it up to harmless interaction. Don't turn around or react to the infringement of your personal space. Do not stop what you are doing. Maintain your focus and pretend that nothing happened. If it persists, you may need to redirect to a different method.

, If you feel there was a violation of your personal space, particularly if you were touched, it may be necessary to elevate the issue. When you feel it is necessary, bring it up to your manager or speak to Human Resources. Bring your documentation, and let them deal with the person.

, Consider the office environment – a supervisor can walk right into a subordinate’s office, but the respect is not always reciprocal. Some workplace situations can’t be controlled, and the more senior the person invading your personal space, the less likely you’ll be able to control the situation."
"
Tell them about personal space constructs.,
Ask the person who is invading your space to back away.,
Let them know they are making you feel uncomfortable.",How to Get a Coworker to Respect Your Personal Space2," Let your coworker know there are varying distances in which people feel either comfortable or uncomfortable. Providing this information may be a wakeup call if they are unaware.



Public space – Research shows this distance is acceptable for all, and roughly about 12 feet.

Social space – This, anywhere from 4-12 feet, is where people should stand when talking to one another.

Personal space – When people get in your actual personal space, which is from 1.5ft to 4ft, they are in an area for those displaying aggressiveness or intimacy.

Intimate space – This is the closest someone can be, less than 1.5ft, and it’s a spot reserved for only those with whom we are intimate. Getting this close is definitely an issue.

, Explain that you are uncomfortable. You shouldn't make a scene at your workplace, but do be clear and firm. It may take a while for them to break the habit. Continue to remind them if they continue to do it. To say ""No"" is absolutely acceptable and appropriate.

, They may simply be unaware of what they’re doing. Or they may believe you two are more closely associated, permitting the closer interaction. Try one of the following approaches:


You are too close to me right now. It’s awkward for you to be this close to me.
Do you realize being this close is a social faux pas?
I’d like to have a bit more room between us when talking. I just don’t like people in my bubble.

"
"
Send nonverbal cues.,
Take a step back.,
Isolate yourself.",How to Get a Coworker to Respect Your Personal Space3," It may be best to send some cues your personal space is being invaded. Try to convey a need for separation with a few of the following examples:


Scoot your chair backward. Create the space to stretch out.
Swing your legs while sitting. The potential for being kicked implies a need for space.
Avoid eye-contact while talking face-to-face. This will show the coworker your disinterest and desire to be involved with something else.
Fold your arms across your chest. This posture exudes defensiveness and a desire to avoid the situation., There is no mistaking the creation of space in this case. Your movement is literally saying, “I’d like you not to be so close.” Body language may or may not work, but movement is an easy way to communicate your displeasure.

, Avoid the situations entirely and ensure they can’t be in your space. Work in different areas when possible, use public situations as little as you can. Try focusing intently on your work so that nobody can interfere with your space at all."

Learn about network marketing.,
Choose a marketing campaign or company.,
Learn from mentors.,
Keep good financial records.,
Keep other sources of income.,
Advertise your products or services.,
Sell your product.,
Recruit downline salespeople.,
Maintain a positive perspective and be truthful.,
Set boundaries for your team.,
Avoid bringing in personal issues.,
Energize your team.",How to Network Market," Network marketing is a sales business in which an individual sells products and recruits others to join their network to sell products. As a result, it is important to understand how people make money in network marketing. In most cases, the people you recruit will also recruit people to becomes salespeople. The various levels in your sales network (the people you recruit and the the people they then recruit and so on) are known as your ""downline.""


Some network marketing companies deal with a wide variety of products and services, while others focus on a single product or service such as deregulated utilities.
Rather than spend money on traditional marketing and sales channels, MLM companies utilize their customers to sell their products.
When you make a sale, you receive a percentage of the sales price, as does the person who recruited you.
When someone you've recruited makes a sale, both of you receive a commission.
When someone you have recruited recruits another sales person who makes a sale, all three of you make a commission
The more people below you, whether directly recruited by you or by someone beneath you, the more money you make.
Profit is made by sales of product, not by fees paid by people recruited into the network (as with pyramid schemes). However, anyone interested in network marketing should know that they have been accused of being pyramid schemes.;
, Perhaps the first step establishing a successful network marketing business is to choose the right opportunity. This is not really the easiest thing to do since there are a plethora of different opportunities you can choose from. However, make sure to consider:


The product. What type of product are you marketing? Does it have wide appeal and is it in demand?
The product or service is the most critical element of success. Ideally, the product or service is constantly used so demand is continuous with repeat customers. It should be competitively priced, typically below similar products or services since the marketing costs are generally lower.
The company. What company are you going with? Do they have good branding and good visibility?
Financial stability is essential. Check their financials if they are publicly traded. In addition, check with the State Licensing Board and Better Business Bureau to determine their legal standing and reputation.
The pay. How will you get paid? What is the percentage of a sale you get paid? What is the percentage you get paid for sales downstream in your network. Be wary of campaigns where profit is generated from fees paid by recruits -- these are pyramid schemes.Volume of sales is more important than commission as an indication of customer acceptance and repeat business. A high commission usually indicates that sales may be difficult.

, After you sign up with a company and get into network marketing, you’ll need to find yourself a mentor to learn from. Rely on the person who recruited you. There is a good chance that you were recruited by someone else into a certain network marketing campaign. This person can serve as your mentor. They will be especially motivated since they will receive a portion of your sales.


Find a mentor in the company you are signing up with. Many network marketing companies will assign you a mentor when you sign up. This person will serve as a mentor and point of contact. They will and should answer any questions you have.
Find a friend who is already in the business. If you know someone who is already in network marketing, contact them and ask if they will be willing to act as a mentor. Make sure they know you won’t be a big drain on their time. Simply see if they’ll be willing to answer some emails, some phone calls, or even go out to lunch every once and a while., Keeping records is critical to succeeding in network marketing. This is important, as just because you don’t have a brick and mortar store front, doesn’t mean you don’t have to function as if you don’t.


Keep records of every expense your business incurs.
Keep records of every dollar your business earns.
Consider getting an accountant for your business., Network marketing is a business that takes time to build. As a result of this, you won’t want to suspend all of your other sources of income when you jump into it. If you have a full-time day job, keep it. If you have a part-time night job, keep it.

Fill in all available spaces with your network marketing job.

As your network marketing income grows, reduce other obligations.
Always make sure you have enough money coming in to meet your obligations. You definitely won’t succeed at network marketing if the bank is about to take your home or you’re about to be evicted from your rental.
View your network marketing job as a small business that you are going to grow overtime into a full-time endeavor., Once you jump into the business, you’ll want to begin by advertising your sales campaign. This will be perhaps the most important thing you initially do to generate income. Fortunately, with modern technology, there are a number of ways to do this.


Use social media. Advertise your campaign over social media. You can do this through websites like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and more.
Print flyers. Depending on what good or service you are marketing, have some flyers printed up and distribute them in your community.
Use word of mouth. Tell your friends and family about your new business. With a little luck, they’ll tell other people and you’ll have some business relatively quickly., While you can make decent passive income by the sales generated by the people in your network, if you really want to succeed in network marketing, you’ll have to actually sell your product. As a result you need to make sure you get out, hit the pavement, and sell your product.


Success comes from expanding beyond friends and family. Be cautious, however, as many people, even friends, will resent a sales pitch or recruiting effort.
Devote a large portion of your work week to meeting new people to sell product to. Depending on your product, you can go door-to-door.
Set up a website to sell your product.
Hire a lead generating service. This could work online or in person., One of the most important aspects of network marketing is the process of recruiting marketers/salespeople who will work below you. As a result, you need to get out there and recruit salespeople to work under you in your network. Make sure to:


Have business cards printed and hand them out to people.
Talk to friends about your new business. Tell friends what you’re doing and let them know that you’d be happy for them to work with you. However, don’t be pushy and don’t try to sell them on it. Just let them know. If they’re interested, they’ll ask you questions.
Post an ad online or in a local newspaper. Advertise and let people know you are looking for salespeople to join your team., Stay positive and be truthful about your success or lack of success. If you’re a superior sales person and recruiter, you will undoubtedly succeed. When your success is apparent, you’ll have an easier time recruiting people. Make sure to never:


Lie or deceive people about income prospects when recruiting someone into your network.
Lie or deceive people about the product or service you sell.
Gossip about your bad day or experience to your team.
Do anyone favors you wouldn't do for your team., Make sure to set boundaries for your team right from the beginning. It is imperative to your business that such boundaries are set in place even before anyone joins your team. It's equally important to have this mind set and rules for yourself before you join into any ""team"" business.


Set boundaries about where members of your team will recruit new salespeople from. You don’t want one member of your team recruiting the uncle of another team member. Make it clear that family are off limits.
Set boundaries about where members of your team will sell product. Talk to your team members and try to figure out where everyone will sell their product. If people are working online, this should be no problem. However, if your team goes door-to-door, you don’t want one member selling product in another team member’s neighborhood.
Set boundaries about what information members of your team will divulge to new recruits, customers, or those outside your network. You don’t want a new recruit telling your competition about internal sales or other important information., In order to help create a positive network culture, make sure not to bring any personal issues into your business. Personal issues can ruin your network and undermine your business. Make sure to avoid.


Recruiting anyone who you have outstanding personality conflicts with.
Talking about religion or politics
Recruiting family members or love interests., Perhaps the most important part of network marketing is to energize your team and keep everyone motivated. Keeping everyone energized and motivated will likely increase sales and morale. To do this, consider:


Creating incentive systems like ""give backs"" of your portion of a subordinate's sale when they meet a certain sales number.
Make regular motivational calls to those below you. Check in with your subordinates every week or two and let them know they are doing a great job and making progress. If they have issues, talk them through it and keep them motivated.
If your system allows it, promise bonuses or promotions to your best salespeople.

Check company policy.If your company discourages or prohibits personal relationships among coworkers, and you don’t want to endanger your job, remind yourself of your priorities.,
Keep in mind the risks of workplace gossip.If you dwell on a crush, and others at your workplace find out, gossip can spread.,
Keep in mind the social risks of acting on a workplace crush.If you act on a crush you have on a coworker, there can be serious social ramifications, whether or not the crush reciprocates.,
Think about the implications of a relationship not working out.Even if you feel like you want to act on a crush, it is worth thinking about all possible outcomes, for better or worse.,

Focus on positive distractions.,
Separate fantasy from reality.,
Realize that you don’t always have to act on your feelings.It is possible to have feelings for someone, including a coworker, without ever acting on them.,
Remember that the grass isn’t always greener.Sometimes, having a crush is mostly fantasy.,
Set boundaries.,
Give yourself time.",How to Get over a Crush on Your Coworker," You will probably decide that the crush is not worth risking your job.


Review your company’s workplace rules (perhaps available from your human resources department, if applicable) regarding personal relationships. Seeing the ramifications of having a romance in the works place spelled out might be enough motivation for you to put an end to the crush.There may also be legal ramifications of having a workplace romance, depending on laws regulating sexual harassment in your area.;
, This can be the case even if you only talk about the crush, and don’t act on it. Gossip can give you a reputation for being unprofessional, and it can also lower your productivity and workplace morale. If you are worried about these risks, it may be best to not discuss your crush at work or with coworkers outside of your workplace.

, Recognizing the risks of these can be enough to end your crush. Potential problems include:


Being rejected by your crush
Lingering awkwardness if your crush does not reciprocate, or, if he or she does at first, but the relationship ultimately does not work outPressuring your crush to reciprocate if you are in a superior position in the workplace
Loss of credibility among your coworkers, who may perceive you as acting unprofessionally or giving special treatment to your crush, It is possible that the relationship could work out long-term, but if it does not:


The relationship might succeed at first, but then fall apart.
If the relationship does not succeed, or eventually falls apart, you will have to deal with seeing the crush at work, possibly being promoted, etc. This can create a great deal of stress.
If the relationship does not work out, and you or the crush feels pressure to resign from your workplace, this will create many more problems.

, In addition to providing the support of a sympathetic ear, your friend might also have advice to give.


If you don’t feel comfortable talking to someone at your workplace about your crush, or if you are worried about workplace gossip spreading, you can talk to a non-work friend.

, If you have been working too much or avoiding social interaction outside of work, then make yourself set aside time to hang out with non-work friends or go and do some activities you enjoy. Look for opportunities to meet people outside of work, as this may take your interests away from your workplace crush.

, Crushes often hold our attention because we let it happen. If you turn your mind to other things, however, it will be easier to get over the crush and move on.


At work, focus your mind on your tasks, and having professional interactions with your coworkers. Even some things as simple as taking time to decorate your office, caring for a potted plant at your desk, or listening to your favorite music while you work can provide positive distractions from your crush.
Outside of work, you can keep yourself from dwelling on your crush by focusing on other things you’ve been meaning to getting around to. Working out more at the gym, spending more time with a hobby, even cleaning your home (if you’ve been putting it off) can serve as positive distractions.

, A crush signifies attraction, but can also get wrapped up in the fantasy of what life would be like if you were to get together with your crush. Separating the fantasies from the feelings of attraction might help you put a crush into perspective.


Fantasy is past and future oriented. Reality is present oriented.
Focus on the life you are living right this moment instead of the life you wish you had.

, If you are sure that you can keep your work life and love life separated, you might be able to deal with having a crush on a coworker by admitting the reality of your feelings while also declaring to yourself that you won’t act on them.


Sometimes, having a workplace crush can even be beneficial. For instance, it might make you dress better, work harder, or participate more in your company.

, Maybe it seems like you would love to act on a crush, but in reality, it is only that the crush is unavailable or forbidden that causes the allure. Perhaps you can get over your crush simply by reminding yourself that you are happy where you are in life now, and that acting on the crush wouldn’t really be a dream come true.

, If you are determined not to engage in workplace romance (to avoid jeopardizing your job, or for any other reason), then devise rules to deter any crushes you may have. For instance, you might decide to only interact with your crush when there are other people around, since this will help prevent you from stepping over your boundary.Oftentimes, setting boundaries makes it easier to get rid of stress and runaway emotions.

, Don’t expect to necessarily get over a crush immediately. Let yourself have enough time to work through your feelings, and decide how you want to move on. Don’t beat yourself up if it takes a little while to get over your crush.

Make a sign up sheet.,
Set the date(s) for your swap.",How to Organize a Lunch Swap1," Some schools or workplaces may have policies that prohibit this kind of lunch sharing. This means that planning your lunch swap without permission could land you in trouble. Ask your manager or supervisor something like:


""I've been reading a lot about how lunch swaps help employee morale. It's like a mini-potluck at lunch time. Do you think we could try this here?""
""Lately, I've been wanting to share some old family recipes with my friends here at work. May I organize a lunch swap so we can all share recipes together?""
""Principal Smith, I think it's important for us to learn how to cook to prepare for living on our own. Do you think we could practice cooking by having a lunch swap at school?"";
, Not everyone has to participate in your lunch swap for it to be a success. As a matter of fact, it may be best to start with a smaller group, as fewer people will be easier to coordinate. However, you lunch swap could be as large as you desire.


Be sensitive when asking classmates and coworkers to join your lunch swap. Some people may prefer to eat alone, or they may be self-conscious of their cooking ability.
If you have enough people bringing food, you might want to open up the lunch swap to the entire office or class to show people how much fun it can be., Food allergies can be deadly, so before you decide any dishes, inquire with other lunch swappers about dietary restrictions.Once you know what ingredients to avoid, you can begin planning dishes.


The quantities and kinds of food for your lunch swap group will be determined by its members.
Generally, there should be enough food for each person to get a portion of a main dish, a salad, one to two sides, and a drink.
Just because one swapper is allergic to a dish doesn't mean you can't make it. However, it should be kept separate from other food and clearly labeled., This will help you keep track of who's part of your lunch swap group and who's bringing what. This is important, because your lunch swap group might change week to week, or even day to day.


You could post your sign up sheet visibly in a common area, or you could use a shared online document for planning.
You can have as little or as much information on your sign up sheet as you desire, though you may want to include name, dish, and contact information on it., You can organize your lunch swap as a monthly, weekly, or daily event.You may have to experiment a little bit to see what frequency works best for your lunch swap group.

Inform them about office extracurriculars.",How to Make a New Employee Feel Welcome," Give new hires a brief tour, pointing out things like different departments, restrooms, break rooms, conference rooms, and the offices of VIPs. People usually don’t start to feel at ease until they become familiar with their environment.


Be sure to let them know if smoking is prohibited on company property.
Point out areas of special interest, like where people like to socialize and where they should never go.;
, Part of any orientation is learning the names of the people you’ll be working with. Not only does familiarizing a new employee with coworkers make them more comfortable, it cuts down on confusion and tension in the new worker’s adjustment.


Instead of a boring list of employees, make a collage of employee faces so that the new employee feels like they are joining a community instead of just a job., Even if the new employee you’ve taken under your wing works in a different department, you can still point out the most helpful places and coworkers at your company.


You can connect them with people who are known to be friendly, and people whose job is similar to your new employee’s so that they can get guidance.
You can direct them to areas of assistance, like Human resources (HR) for details on health insurance or the company purchaser for supplies they might need.

, No matter what job a new employee has, they will need supplies to make it happen. Part of the new recruit’s first tour should be the supply closet so they don’t waste others’ time (and their own) looking for materials.


See to it that their desk is stocked with enough supplies to get them started.

, Any professional company is going to have a set of guidelines to maintain congenial office relations. One company may pay a lot of attention to rules about attire, and another may not care about clothes but make a lot of rules about personal time. Make sure your new employee gets a list of clearly written rules from you or the HR department.


Rules about cell phone usage, for example, are pertinent for any employee, since phones can be small but time-consuming distractions.
Have the new employee display these rules in their office space until they appear to understand the basics.

, There is no federal law stating that employers must offer breaks, but if they do, federal law does stipulate that employees do not have to clock out or have their pay docked for breaks up to 20 minutes long.Most employers are aware that breaks encourage productivity rather than slow it down, so even though it’s not enforced by law, your employer will most likely have a break schedule in place.
Since the federal government does not enforce scheduled breaks, many states have laws dictating breaks after working a set amount of hours.Show the new employee the break room and all amenities it offers, including free coffee and snacks.
Tell them the quirks of the appliances, like coffee makers and microwaves, so that the new employee isn’t embarrassed by a preventable accident.

, A contact list is different from the welcome list that includes all employees in the company. A contact list contains only personnel that are useful for making the new employee’s job easier, usually people in their department, with detailed summaries of each person’s job tasks.


Point out that it's helpful for the new employee to display this relevant contact list close to their company phone or computer for faster communication.

, Although the new employee will have undoubtedly met their direct supervisor, they probably haven’t gotten a chance to know them. Give the new employee the chance to have a meaningful connection with the boss, and encourage them to set up a time to get to know him or her better.

, Eating with other people has been shown to improve health, but most importantly, it assists in establishing a good support system. The best way to help your new employee to start feeling welcome is to eat with them.


Eating with other people is also healthy because it encourages the introduction of new foods, reduces the amount of processed food consumed, and causes you to pay more attention to what you eat., Every workplace has its quirks. Letting the new employee in on a few tidbits helps them feel part of the team. This feeling of camaraderie creates a stronger work environment right off the bat—research even reveals that employees are happier when they have friends in the workplace.For example, you might share that, “The boss gets really upset if we're even a couple of minutes late, so be sure to call and let someone know.”
You could also mention a policy about something the new employee has in common with you, like being a working parent: ""Just so you know, we're not allowed to bring our children to work on snow days.”

, Sharing a few pieces of helpful information about the boss or coworkers does not mean you should launch into detailed gossip. Gossip is usually critical of others, so this might start feelings of animosity between the new employee and seasoned workers.


Gossip is defined as “information about the behavior and personal lives of other people.”They don't need to know who is having an affair with the boss, or who just got out of rehab.

, When the new employee makes their first mistake, be there to encourage them. Even if you work in another department, you can call the new employee to check on them throughout the first few days. This way, the new employee won’t get overwhelmed, and they will want to keep working for your company.


Consider sharing one of your own stories to lighten their embarrassment. You could say, ""On my first day here, I accidentally hung up on the CEO!""
If you do work in a different department, find someone who works near the new employee who would be friendly enough to stop and check on the newbie. Tell this person to encourage the new employee if they voice concerns about having made errors.

, Some organizations are large enough to host sports teams within the company, such as kickball or softball teams. Even if your company is small, if groups of coworkers gather after work on a regular basis, tell the new employee about it.

Don't take things too personally.,
Dismiss inappropriate comments in a professional way.,
Keep your cool.,
Find strength in numbers.,
Talk to the bully about boundaries.,
Talk to the bully's enablers.,
Tell a superior about the bully.,
File a formal complaint with HR.,
Consider moving on.",How to Get a Bully to Back off in the Work Place," Some people are not particularly friendly when they're in a professional environment, and it's important to distinguish this kind of behavior from bullying. Just because someone is not treating you like a buddy, does not mean you're being bullied, so try not to let small offences affect you too seriously.Try not to get too upset every time someone critiques your work or disagrees with you. This kind of behavior usually does not constitute bullying.True bullies will engage in unnecessarily aggressive or hostile behavior. They will often target one or more people by spreading rumors about them, taking credit for things that they have done, or failing to include them in important matters. This kind of behavior needs to be addressed right away.;
, If a workplace bully is talking about you in a way that is not appropriate, it's important to stand up for yourself, but to do so in a dignified and professional way. Consider saying something like, ""That's not an appropriate way to talk about your coworkers"" or ""You are acting in a very unprofessional way.""Never stoop to the bully's level and return insults with insults. This will only egg the bully on and make you look bad to your other coworkers.

, It's important not to let the bully see how emotional you are. Letting on that the bully is causing you emotional distress will only make the situation worse because that is exactly what the bully wants.If you can't continue talking to the bully without losing it, simply remove yourself from the situation.If you need to let your emotions out, find someone you can confide in and make sure the bully will never know about it.

, If the workplace bully is targeting other employees as well, stand up for them and ask them to do the same for you. For example, if you hear the bully telling everyone that one of your coworkers is not doing her job, consider chiming in and letting everyone know how much help that employee offered you on a recent project.The more you and your other positive coworkers stick together as a team, the less power the bully will have over any of you.

, If the bully is not relenting even though you are standing up for yourself, you might need to have a more direct conversation. Explain exactly what kind of behavior you will no longer tolerate.You can be assertive without being aggressive. For example, instead of saying, ""You need to stop being such a jerk to me,"" you can say, ""It's not appropriate for you to shut down my ideas without letting me explain them.""
Make sure to clearly communicate the consequences that the bully will face if he continues the same behavior. For example, you might say, ""If you continue to spread rumors about me, I will report you to HR.""
This conversation will let the bully know that you are not going to just roll over and allow others to treat you badly.

, In some cases, high-ranking employees who have the power to stop the bully's bad behavior end up enabling them instead, simply by failing to react to the unacceptable behavior. If this is the case in your workplace, consider having a talk with the enablers and asking them to help.For example, if the bully constantly belittles other people in meetings, you could ask the manager who typically runs the meetings to create clearer guidelines for good meeting etiquette.
The bully never has to know that you talked to someone about their behavior. You could ask the enabler to just make a general announcement about new policies instead of singling out that person.

, If you've tried handling the situation on your own to no avail, you may want to consider talking to a superior. If you and the bully have different bosses, determine which of them you think would be most willing to help you.It helps if you can have evidence to support your claims of bullying. For example, if the bully left you a nasty voicemail or posted an inappropriate comment about you on the company message board, bring this evidence to your meeting with the bully's superior.
There is always a risk that you will be considered a ""troublemaker"" if you complain about a coworker. In some cases, you may risk losing your job, especially if the bully is a high-ranking employee. It's important to understand these risks before you decide to complain about the bully.

, Your last option for reporting the bully will typically be to go to your company's human resources department and file a formal complaint. Just like complaining to a superior, this may have unintended consequences, so be sure that you are ready to deal with them before you complain.It's especially important to file a complaint if you have been the victim of sexual harassment or if the bully has been violent in any way.
Always consult your employee handbook to understand the proper procedure for reporting an incident, as this is different for every company.

, If nothing you do helps the situation and the bully is making you completely miserable at work, it might be time for you to move on to a new job. While this may seem like quitting, you can't underestimate the importance of your own happiness and mental health."

Label food with allergens clearly.,
Try new and interesting dishes.,
Get to know other lunch swappers better.,
Tell fellow lunch swappers about your dish.",How to Organize a Lunch Swap2," In the event that one of your lunch swappers has a serious food allergy, be sure to label all food that contains that allergen. This can be done easily by using a sticky note and a marker to list the offending ingredient(s).


Keep utensils for the food with the allergens separate. You can easily spread allergens in this way., New food can be intimidating, but you have a great opportunity to get to know the features of various dishes during your lunch swap. If you're an adventurous eater, take a small sample of each dish.


Picky eaters shouldn't feel obligated or pressured to try food they don't like. Doing so can create unnecessary friction during lunch., Many lunch swap groups make it a point to avoid the topic of work while eating. This is a good way to disconnect during the workday and recharge your batteries with some pleasant conversation.Ask other lunch swappers about hobbies, family, friends, and free time activities. You never know when you might share something in common with someone.

, You may have prepared an old family recipe, or maybe you tried to make a new dish. In either case, you can teach other lunch swappers what you know or learned about your dish.


This is a great way to tell other swappers about family they might not be able to meet in person.
Throw in preparation details to help others who might want to make the dish themselves. For example, you might have noticed that a dish tastes better with less salt, cooks better at a lower heat, and so on.

Organize a cleanup crew.,
Throw away garbage and store uneaten food.,
Wipe clean the surfaces you've eaten on.,
Take out the garbage, if necessary.",How to Organize a Lunch Swap3," Smaller lunch swap groups might require each person to pitch in with cleanup, but for larger groups, most of the cleanup can probably be handled by three to five people. Rotating between swappers for cleanup duty will fairly distribute the work among everyone.


As a perk for those cleaning up, you might allow members on the cleanup crew to take leftovers home in plastic containers.

, Paper products, utensils, sauces, and similar items often become garbage when used. These should be thrown away in the garbage when your meal is done. Separate recyclable material and put in proper receptacle. Uneaten food can be stored and taken home in plastic-ware.

, Bits of food left on your desk or lunch table can become home to bacteria and attract bugs, like ants and cockroaches. Take a mild cleaning agent and spray the table with it. Then use a clean rag or paper towel to wipe the table clean.Crumbs and other dirt will collect under your rag as you wipe. Push this buildup off the edge of the table and into a free hand, then dump the crumbs in the trash.

, Creating a mess is a surefire way of getting lunch swapping banned in your office. Most of the cleanup at this point should already done, but it's easy to overlook a full garbage can. If you've filled up the garbage over the course of your meal, take it out when you're finished.


Additionally, if you've thrown food away in the garbage, it can attract bugs or rot and give off a bad smell. Taking out the garbage after eating will prevent this."

Communicate effectively.,
Appreciate diversity.,
Develop mutual respect.,
Be mindful.,
Get to know your co-workers.",How to Develop Positive Work Relationships1," The foundation of every good relationship is solid communication. Whether you are communicating via e-mail, phone, or face to face, you want to make sure that you communicate clearly and effectively with your colleagues. Good relationships rely on open, honest communication.Choose your words carefully. Make sure that you clearly articulate your points and state exactly what you mean. This will help avoid confusion about goals or expectations.
Listen actively. Communication includes listening. Demonstrate to your co-workers that you are paying attention by asking follow up questions and paraphrasing some of their statements.;
, It is important to remember that everyone is different. Each person that you work with brings a different attribute to your workplace. While they might not be the type of person you are used to, try to focus on their positive characteristics.For example, you might not be used to working with members of a creative team. Creatives tend to work differently from others, which sometimes means they are not as structured. Instead of being irritated when someone does not immediately reply to your e-mail, remember that they are bringing something else to the team.

, Mutual respect means that you exhibit respect for your colleagues and they reciprocate. Find ways to show that you truly value your colleagues contribution to your workplace. Let them know that you consider them (and their work) important.One way to demonstrate respect is to offer positive affirmations. For example, you could say, ""Sally, I really admire the way you handled yourself with that difficult client. Not everyone can remain so calm under pressure.""

, Being mindful means practicing a deeper level of awareness. Pay careful attention to your words and your actions. If you act or speak without thinking, you might be damaging work relationships without even realizing it. Try thinking about your words before you actually say them.Take a 30 second break each hour. You can do this right at your desk. Take some time to reflect on how your day has gone so far, and what you have coming up next. Give some thought to how you will handle your next challenge.
Being mindful will not only help you feel more in control, it will make you look calm and collected to your co-workers.

, One of the best ways to build positive relationships is to make time to learn about people. The next time you are early to a meeting, take a minute to chat with those around you. Small talk might not seem like much, but it can actually help you discover things that you have in common with your office mates.Ask questions. People like to talk about themselves, so ask how their kid's birthday party was, or if they are enjoying their new puppy.

Act responsibly.,
Be reliable.,
Have a positive attitude.,
Cope with conflict.",How to Develop Positive Work Relationships2," If you want your colleagues to like and respect you, you need to make sure that you are doing your job well. No one appreciates a co-worker who shirks their responsibilities. Make a point to finish your work on time.


Be sure to demonstrate that you are responsible. If you agree to do something, make sure that you complete that task. For example, if your cubicle mate asks you to attend a meeting for her, make sure that you show up.
Acting responsible includes taking responsibility for your actions. For example, if you make an error, don't try to hide it or shift blame to someone else. Acknowledge your mistake and make it clear that you will fix it.

, One way to excel at your job is to show others that you are someone they can depend on. There are many ways that you can demonstrate your reliability. It can be as simple as showing up on time every day, or as big as volunteering to lead the team on a new project.Make sure that your co-workers know that they can trust you. For example, you can update them on your progress by saying, ""Sam, I just wanted to let you know that I've followed through on those e-mails you wanted me to send. Let me know if you'd like me to do anything else to help you out.""

, Sometimes it can be difficult to be in a good mood when you're at work. After all, there is usually something else that you would rather be doing. But remember that no one likes to be around negativity. Try to display a positive attitude, even if you are feeling stressed or unhappy.


Smile. The simple act of smiling shows that you have a good attitude. Bonus: when you smile, you will actually start to feel happier.
Take a deep breath. Instead of expressing your frustrations with anger, take a few moments to breathe deeply and find something positive about the situation.

, Unfortunately, you will sometimes have to deal with conflict in the workplace. If you handle it well, you can still build positive work relationships. When a problem arises, make sure to actively listen. Also, make sure to only address the situation after all parties have had a chance to cool down.Be proactive. For example, you could say, ""John, I know there's been some tension between us lately. I wanted to know if there was anything I can do to make the situation better.""

"
"
Be more creative.,
Like your job.,
Have a support system.",How to Develop Positive Work Relationships3," Having positive work relationships comes with a lot of benefits. One of the most important is that there will be more of a sense of teamwork in your office. This will foster activities such as brainstorming and collaboration. All of this leads to more creativity.


Getting along with your colleagues will help you to feel more comfortable and confident in the workplace. This will make you feel more confident about offering new solutions and innovations.

, The most obvious benefit of forming positive work relationships is that you will take more pleasure in your job. If you look forward to seeing your co-workers each day, the act of going to work each day becomes much less stressful. Positive relationships will also help you perform better and have less stress.If it is appropriate for your corporate culture, try organizing a monthly happy hour or other activity. Spending time together outside of work is a great way to bond.

, It is important to have people who support you in the workplace. If you are overwhelmed with your workload, or you are having a conflict with your boss, it really helps to know that you are part of a team. If you have fostered positive relationships, you'll find that others are willing to help you out when you need it.


Make sure to return the favor and be helpful and supportive to those you work with.

Be honest.,
Stick to the facts.,
Don't point the finger.,
Don't complain.,
Save the details about a wrongful termination.,
Show that you have learned from your mistakes.,
Surround the negatives with positives.,
Turn the attention to your other work history.",How to Explain a Termination in a Job Interview1," When your interviewer asks you why you left your last job, the best thing you can do is be honest. Making up stories will only make you seem irresponsible and untrustworthy.Think about what your employer might say if the interviewer calls to follow up on your story. It's very important that you don't say anything that will be contradicted by your former employer's story. This means if you were fired for misconduct, you need to own up to it instead of saying you resigned.
It's also important to address the question at hand. Trying to dodge it by changing the subject will only make you seem suspicious.;
, Try to avoid getting emotional when explaining why you were fired, even if you feel strongly about it. Instead, offer a very brief description of the events that resulted in your termination.Sticking to the facts will help you avoid coming across as overly apologetic. While you should take responsibility for the termination to a reasonable extent, apologizing for your actions during an interview will only make you seem desperate.
For example, instead of saying, ""My boss was really mean to me and I couldn't handle the pressure, so I made some dumb mistakes, which I know was really bad,"" try saying something like, ""The way I work is very different from the way my former boss works. He thrives on the pressure of last-minute deadlines, while I prefer to prepare for projects well in advance. Because of this I was not always able to get the results he was looking for.""

, A prospective employer is not likely to believe you if you blame your termination solely on your former employer and don't accept any personal responsibility. Be sure to comment at least somewhat on your own role, even if you just say that you were not the right fit for the company's culture or the specific job.Don't say ""Everybody in that organization violated company policies now and then but never got caught. I am just unlucky for getting caught."" Blaming others for your own mistakes only shows that you are self-righteous and irresponsible.
Don't dwell on your wrongdoings either! Keep this very brief and then move on to more positive comments.

, It's never a good idea to say anything negative about your former employer during an interview, no matter what the circumstances.Do your best to stay calm and collected, even if you're still angry about being terminated. You do not want to look like a person who holds a grudge.

, Even if you feel you were discriminated against, it's usually best not to let your interviewer know that you are pursuing or are considering pursuing legal action against your former employer. While it is technically illegal to not hire you because of this, the interviewer may see it as a red flag nonetheless. You don't want to give your prospective employer any reason to believe that you will cause legal problems for them in he future., Once you acknowledge what went wrong at your last job, it's important to communicate what lessons you've taken away from that experience. Talk about how you have grown and how you would confront the same situation if it happened today.If you were fired for violating company policy, try saying something like, ""I didn’t realize that violating the policy would be taken seriously. But this incident helped me become more responsible and respectful of rules. I understand the gravity of what I did, and as a result have more respect for the company, the position, and the responsibility that came with it.""
Make it very clear that you will not repeat the same mistake again.
Do not be overly critical of yourself, or you may come off as lacking in confidence and desperate for the job. Just talk about the lessons you have learned in a subtle and positive manner, never berating yourself to show false modesty. You should be selling yourself, not selling yourself short.

, If you need to say something a little bit negative in order to explain your termination, make sure to surround the statement with positive remarks to avoid sounding overly negative.If, for example, you were fired because you had a difficult time getting along with your coworkers, try sandwiching this information between statements about your enthusiasm for doing a good job and the lessons you've learned about teamwork.

, If you have only been fired once and have an otherwise good record, focus on your past achievements, emphasizing that being fired was an anomaly for you."
"
Highlight their work.,
Avoid taking the behavior personally.,
Search for the positives.,
Counteract the negative.",How to Deal with Toxic Coworkers1," Toxicity is often a sign of insecurity. By giving the co-worker credit or highlighting something that they’ve done, you may give them some semblance of positivity in their life, which could help with the toxicity. You may also find a friend you didn’t think you could have.


For example, tell your boss all that your co-worker has done if you’ve worked together on a project. Or nominate them for employee of the month. You never know what this act of kindness could do for someone.;
, Chances are, you’re not the reason for the behavior. However, you may be the person on which they are taking out their frustrations. But that doesn’t mean you should allow it.


Hold the person accountable for their behavior and don’t justify it. Attempt to talk to them about it. You could ask them why they behave the way they do towards you. Your confrontation may be enough to make them stop. Keep in mind that being direct and respectful is a much better option than letting the behavior slide. Letting it slide may lead to more problems over time.

, Dealing with a toxic co-worker can affect more areas of your life than just work. It can make you act differently at home and in other aspects of your life. Find people who could potentially lift you up, especially if it is at work.


Along with surrounding yourself with people who are positive, give yourself some positive self-talk, as well. Remind yourself that you are a good person who has many things to contribute, despite how this person may make you feel., There are always two sides to every situation. Try to help the person see the positive rather than the negative. Tell the person the reasons why the situation isn’t as bad as they think it is. Doing so could put a spin on their perspective, making life easier for both of you.


For instance, if the person says, “I hate these hours. I can’t ever do what I want.” You could say, “I actually like the hours. It allows me to have more flexibility with my schedule outside of work.” Telling them a positive to their negatives may also make them stop flooding you with the toxic comments."
"
Don't be ashamed of a layoff.,
Cut yourself some slack.,
Talk to your former employer.,
Save the details.,
Boost your resume.,
Ooze professionalism.",How to Explain a Termination in a Job Interview2," Being laid off is not the same thing as being fired. It likely had more to do with the company's bottom line than it did with your performance, and your interviewer knows that. If you were laid off, try not to worry too much about how it will look.If you were laid off, emphasize this by saying something like, ""My position was eliminated"" or ""the company let many employees go due to financial issues.""

, Even if you were fired for some kind of wrongdoing, it's important not to eat yourself up about it. If you do, it may have a negative effect on your confidence, which can come across to prospective employers as a lack of competence., Depending on how exactly things ended with your last employer, you may be able to get their support. Talk to your former employer about providing a reference for you when you begin looking for a new job. Even though you were fired, they may still have some nice things to say about you, and you may be able to work out a mutually acceptable story about your termination.You will probably have to be willing to own up to your mistakes. If, for example, you were fired because you weren't efficient enough, try admitting the mistakes you made and explaining what you've learned from them. Your former employer might be willing to recommend you on the basis that you've learned your lesson.
Even if you can't get the support of your manager, you may be able to get a good reference from someone else you worked with at the company. Don't be afraid to ask.
If you did something really bad, like stealing from the company or assaulting a coworker, you probably won't have much luck with this.

, You don't need to state why you left your last job on your resume or in your cover letter, unless the question is specifically asked. Even if you are asked to provide an answer in writing, keep it brief and nonspecific. You can offer more details during your in-person interview.In some cases you may feel that it would be beneficial to explain a termination immediately before you are put on the spot about it. This is entirely up to you, but keep in mind that you might be better able to explain it during a face-to-face conversation, rather than with a few sentences in your cover letter or on an application.

, If you were out of work for a while after being terminated, you may be worried about how your extended absence from the workforce will look on your resume. Instead of looking like you were doing nothing during this period of unemployment, show your prospective employer that you spent the time enhancing your skills.If possible, improve your employability by getting a new degree or certificate, or just by taking a few classes to learn some new skills.
Try your hand at freelancing or consulting. Even if you don't have much business, it will help fill the gap and it will make you look like a leader.
Volunteer work can be a resume booster too, especially if it's related in some way to your field.

, If you want your prospective employer to look past your termination, one of the best things you can do is put some extra effort into being professional. Don't give your interviewer any reason to doubt your ability to get the job done. Be sure to practice good interview etiquette by dressing professionally, arriving early, and silencing your phone.
It's also important to do your research about the company and be well-prepared to answer questions about the industry and job requirements.

Request a face to face meeting with your manager.,
Conduct the meeting politely but truthfully.,
Do not concentrate on the negative.,
Provide constructive criticism.,
Do not gloat over your new role.,
Thank your manager for the opportunity to work, learn, and grow within the company.,
Have a signed resignation letter prepared.",How to Explain Why You Are Leaving Your Job1," If you work in the same office or can easily travel to see your manager (as you may do for other meetings), requesting a face to face meeting may be simple. If your manager is easily reachable in person, a phone call or video conference will do. It is not necessary to fly or even drive over 4 hours to break the news.


When requesting a meeting, say “I would like to have a short meeting with you to discuss something. When is a good time today?” You do not need to say you are leaving your job at this point.;
, Start off by thanking your manager for taking the time to meet with you. Politely state that you have chosen to leave the company. Then, state your last date of employment.


It is considered customary to give at least 2 weeks notice. However, some positions may require you to give a longer notice (3 weeks to 1 month). Positions that may require a lengthier time are generally those that cannot easily be filled, such as one-person departments or senior and executive management level positions.

, Stay as positive as possible and do not dwell on any negative reasons for leaving.


For example, if you are leaving for a higher salary, do not say, “I am leaving because the pay is too low and I am doing more work than Joe who I know is getting paid more than me”. Instead, you can say, “I am leaving for a more profitable opportunity”.

, Constructive criticism is best suited during an exit interview. However, some companies may not conduct an exit interview; in that case, you can express your thoughts with your manager. To find out if there is an exit interview, ask your manager or Human Resources.


Remember to stay positive while providing suggestions or constructive criticism. The idea is to help the company retain its employees. For example, if the company does not provide additional leadership training you can say, “It would be good for employees if the company allowed more leadership training“.

, If you are leaving on good terms, your manager may be sad, annoyed, or even jealous to see you go. It is okay to tell your manager the name of the new company and your new title. Limit any details such as key duties and projects because you may naturally get excited about the new opportunity and leave a bad last impression.

, Most jobs leave you with valuable knowledge and experience that can lead you to the next steps in your career. Recognizing this fact and thanking your manager is important in order to leave a good lasting impression.

, Your letter should state the basic details of your resignation. Present your resignation letter at the end of your meeting. This letter will be kept in your file and should include:


A statement that you are leaving.
Provide your last date of employment.
Ending on a good note by thanking them for the opportunity.
An example of how to start your resignation letter would be: “This letter is to inform you that I am leaving my position as Sales Manager as of June 23, 2014. I thank the company for providing me the opportunity to learn and grow within my position and wish management and staff luck in the future.”

"
Keep yourself away.,
Speak to someone about the behavior.,
Don’t engage.",How to Deal with Toxic Coworkers2," Try to distance yourself from the toxicity. Keeping yourself away can prevent you from being affected by the negativity and stop you from becoming toxic yourself.


Ask to be seated somewhere else at work to get away from the co-worker, if possible. You could also have a one-on-one talk with your manager or boss and tell them why you would prefer not to work with the person., The person may be so used to their toxic behavior that they don’t even realize they are doing it. If they are impeding with your productivity or livelihood, it may be time to alert the attention of your supervisor. Bring other co-workers into the conversation, if needed. Having more people with you can make a bigger impact.


You could say, “I just want to make you aware of how Terry acts at work. It makes him look like a negative person, which I don’t think he really means to be.” Then go on to give examples of their toxicity. Giving proof can help them believe it more, and make it more likely that they take action.Also, keep in mind that you might find out that you are the only one bothered by the person’s behavior. You may be projecting your own negativity onto this person, so be prepared for this possibility.

, Keep things short and sweet with this person, particularly if they start to complain. Interacting any further with them only encourages them to keep going. Shutting them down lets them know you aren’t interested.


For example, when they start to complain about something that happened to them at work, you could say, “I’m sorry to hear that.” And then change the subject. The person should take the hint that you aren’t interested in hearing their negative comments, eventually."
"
Understand why the person’s behavior bugs you so much.,
Think of yourself first.,
Throw yourself into work.,
Leave the work environment.",How to Deal with Toxic Coworkers3," Are you bothered by the person’s behavior because it reminds you of something you don’t like about yourself? Do they talk about things that bother you, but that you don’t want to speak up about? Taking a good hard look at the real reason for your disdain may help you learn to deal with it better.The next time you're in the presence of the toxic coworker, observe what they do and what goes on in your head. Take some notes. Later, review what you observed and see if you can find any personal impact.
For example, maybe this person makes hideous comments that you would never say aloud. However, you do think these comments in your head. You may be upset because this person doesn't know to keep such comments to themselves, or you might be envious because you would never dare speak them aloud.

, You don’t want to turn into that toxic co-worker you can’t stand. A good way to stop that from happening is to find out how they got there. You may be able to prevent that by putting yourself in their shoes. Taking a look at something through their eyes may shed some light onto the situation.


For instance, reflect on your own attitudes and think about how you’re acting towards them. Think about how you are perceived by them, especially if it is you that they often lash out at. Is it something you are doing unconsciously? If so, change your ways and they may change theirs. You may also stop yourself from becoming so negative, as well.Try to learn whatever you can from the situation and view it as an opportunity for growth. This may help to make the situation into something positive.

, Keep yourself busy and try not to pay attention to what they’re doing. Try not to give yourself any downtime. Doing so can stop you from engaging with them and give you an excuse if they attempt to engage with you.


For instance, if they walk into your office or desk and attempt to have a conversation, you could say, “I’m sorry. I don’t have time to talk. I really need to get this work done.” You’re not lying and it sends a message., Sometimes you just can’t make a situation better. You may not be able to change the person’s ways. Instead of staying around and waiting for something to happen, while the toxicity tears away at you little by little, your best option may be to leave.


There’s not much chance that the person in question will leave or get fired. Unfortunately, you may have to make the move. Doing so may seem difficult at first, but it will likely be better for you in the long run."

Request a face to face meeting with you manager and/or Human Resources.,
Remain polite but truthful.,
Avoid showing any negative emotions such as anger and/or frustration.,
Do not focus unnecessarily on the negative.,
Offer constructive criticism.,
Do not brag about your new role.,
Thank your manager for the opportunity to work for the company.,
Have a signed resignation letter prepared.",How to Explain Why You Are Leaving Your Job2," Usually when leaving a company, notifying your manager is good enough. However, if a situation has already involved Human Resources (such as a dispute with your manager or a harassment issue), request that a representative from Human Resources be present. It is easier to request a face to face meeting if you work in the same office or can easily travel to a common location (as you may do for other meetings). If either your manager or Human Resources are not readily reachable in person, you may request a phone call or video conference. It is not essential to fly or drive over 4 hours to break the news.


When requesting a meeting, say “I would like to have a short meeting with you to discuss something. When is a time good today?” You do not need to say you are leaving your job at this point.

, Start off by thanking anyone present for taking the time to meet with you. Then, politely express that you have chosen to leave the company. Give your last date of employment. A 2-week notice is considered customary and professional. However, if the situation is serious as with a harassment issue, you may be waived the 2 week notice requirement.

, When you come into a meeting with strong, upsetting emotions, it is difficult to have a productive meeting. The meeting may become high-tension and leave both parties upset. This is not the best way to leave your job. It is important to remain as calm as possible, even if it pains you to do so.

, This means not to discuss all the negatives about your job. Keep it simple and short by briefly stating your reasons for leaving and move on.


For example, if you are leaving because a conflict with you manager, do not say, “I am leaving because my manager is mean and doesn’t understand me."" Instead, you can say, “I am leaving due to conflict in management style and (your manager’s name) would agree this work relationship is not working out”.

, You may provide constructive criticism during an exit interview. If your company does not conduct exit interviews, you can ask your manager or Human Resources if you can provide suggestions on how to improve the company. If they decline, do not insist. If the company does want to hear your suggestions:


Provide valuable suggestions or constructive criticism so that the company can retain its other employees. For example, if you left because of harassment, you can say “It would be good for the employees if the company provided additional harassment training“.

, If you are leaving and already have a new job, it is OK to disclose the name of the new company and your new title. However, if you start discussing details such as your new responsibilities, it may seem like you are bragging and can leave a bad impression.

, Many jobs provide valuable knowledge and experience to help you advance your career. Even if you are leaving due to an unpleasant situation, it is important to recognize this fact and thank your manager for the opportunity. This will leave a good lasting impression.

, Your letter should state the basic details of your resignation. Present your resignation letter at the end of your meeting. This letter will be kept in your file and should include:


A sentence telling the company you are leaving.
Your last date of employment.
A thank you for the opportunity to work for the company.
An example of a good resignation letter would be: “I wish to inform you that I am resigning from my position as Sales Manager. My last date of employment will be April 5, 2014. Thank you for the opportunity to gain valuable experience and I wish the company good luck in the future”.

Consider negotiating the reason for your dismissal.,
Postpone signing a severance agreement.,
Try to leave on good terms.,

Understand the concept of “employment-at-will.” In the United States, most employees work “at will.” Employment-at-will means the employer has the right to terminate your employment with or without cause at any time, except illegally as with discrimination or retaliation.,

Network when possible.",How to Deal with Getting Fired for No Reason," Sit quietly and listen to what your employer says. You need to retain the information that is given to you. Listen closely to what your boss says that you can have a better understanding of why you are being fired.;
, The decision to terminate your employment has already been made. Nothing you can say, at this point, will change your employer’s decision. Do not argue or attempt to persuade your employer to reconsider.If you do argue, your employer might be inclined to say negative things about you to other perspective employers.

, When you are fired, you are probably going to feel emotional. This is completely understandable. However, it’s best not to let your emotions get the best of you. Whether you feel sad or angry, take a deep breath, remain calm, and try not to cause a scene.Practice breathing exercises if you feel like you're about to have an emotional outburst. Excuse yourself for a moment and then breathe in slowly while you count to 10. Hold your breath for a moment, and then slowly breathe out while counting to 10 again. Do this until you feel like you have a better grasp on your emotions.

, If your employer has not explained his or her reasons for terminating your employment, it is fine to ask. Be prepared, however, to get an unsatisfying answer, such as “it was just a business decision,” or no answer at all. In addition, consider asking:


What are the next steps?
Is there paperwork to fill out?
Does the company provide information for a staffing service?
What are the exit procedures?

, You can agree with your ex-boss to describe the dismissal in a neutral way so that when you apply for future jobs, you can smoothly pass reference checks.

, If you are offered a severance package in exchange for signing a “general release,” think twice before signing immediately. Doing so would eliminate your opportunity to make legal claims against your employer because it effectively says that the company is released of all legal obligations when firing you.Take your time, and consider showing the agreement to a lawyer before you sign.

, As upset as you may be, remember to thank your employer for the opportunity. Then be on your way. Allowing your anger and frustration to take over will only hurt you in the long run. If you behave unprofessionally – if you yell, throw things, or threaten anyone, for example – your actions will be noted, and they may be reported to potential employers.


It is important to leave on good terms so that you can potentially use your ex-employer in the future, such as if a job you apply for requires that you speak to your old employer before hiring you.

, You should cut expenses and budget so that you have the funds to support yourself for several months without any new income. If you need to make to make any doctor’s visits, you should plan to do it before your insurance expires., Unfortunately, employment-at-will means that your employer does not have to provide a clear reason for letting you go.


If you are not sure whether your job was an employment-at-will, check your new hire paperwork (if you still have it), ask the Human Resources department, or contact your state’s Department of Labor.

, If you signed a special contract with your employer, live in a state with additional regulations, or are part of a union contract, you might not be employed at will. In such situations, your employer could be forced to prove that you qualify for being fired. Also, you might be entitled to some sort of compensation.Check your state’s Department of Labor website for information about any relevant local regulations.
Check your new hire paperwork to see if the contract gives you any special rights.
There are cases where a contract will actually make you liable to pay back compensation if you are fired. If you were paid for relocation expenses, you will typically be required to work for the company for a certain period of time or become liable to repay the benefits given you. Most contracts only stipulate this if you quit or were fired with good cause, but your employer can write the contract so as to make you liable in all situations., Even if you are employed at will, there are some cases in which an employer is not able to terminate you. Dismissal under these conditions can be cause for a lawsuit.


You are not able to terminate an employee as retaliation. If you have filed a claim for workers compensation or reported legal transgressions by your employer, you have a case for wrongful termination.
It is wrongful termination if there is any evidence that you have been fired because of discrimination against you on the basis of your race, national origin, gender, age, religion, pregnancy, family status, veteran status, disability, and, in some states, sexual orientation.
Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Delaware, Idaho, Massachusetts, Nevada, Montana, Utah, and Wyoming have laws that allow you to sue if you believe your employer did not have just cause. Unjust terminations include, firing an employee to prevent them from collecting sales commissions, misleading employees about prospects for promotion, and terminating someone to replace them with a person who is willing work for less.If your company has a policy on termination in its employment manuals, this is part of your “implied contract” and any violation of it is a type of wrongful termination., Specifics may vary from state to state, so check with your state’s Department of Labor and ask your Human Resources representative or benefits administrator for more information .If you are fired, you may have the right to:


Get unemployment benefits.
Continue your health coverage with COBRA.
Receive any compensation you have earned, including hours you have already worked. Half of all states require that your employer also pay you for unused vacation time. Even if your state does not, your employer could often be liable to a lawsuit if the refuse to cover your vacation time., To see if you are eligible to claim unemployment, contact your state’s Unemployment Office and speak to a representative. Specific regulations can vary, but in general, to receive unemployment, you must be unemployed through no fault of your own – meaning that you were not let go due to a performance issue or any kind of misconduct. In addition, you must be able to work and actively looking for a job.


If you quit, you are not eligible for unemployment unless you have “good cause.” Instances of “good cause” include: family emergencies, abusive or unsafe working conditions, leaving to care for a child, loss of transportation, or a drastic cut of pay – usually defined as 20% or more.You are not eligible for unemployment if you have been fired with good cause.
Self-employed individuals generally aren’t eligible for unemployment unless the business has been incorporated and pays into unemployment., You should research filing for unemployment for the state in which you were last employed, even if you have moved since then. You should be prepared to say if you have any holiday pay left. Also you should know whether you want taxes withheld from your unemployment check., Many procedures vary from state to state, but now all state unemployment programs have a website. Your state’s Unemployment Office should provide you with the correct information and procedures. Generally, when you file a claim, you should be prepared to provide the following information]Mailing Address.
Phone Number.
Social Security number.
Driver’s License number.
Mother’s maiden name.
Name, address, and phone number of last employer.
Full employment history for the preceding two years.

, Your employer might contest your claim to unemployment. If that happens, you will need to have an informal trial before the Unemployment Appeal Board. Review the state procedures for an appeal online.


Make sure to act promptly. In many states, you must appeal within a certain time frame in order to secure a hearing. Check with your state’s Unemployment Office for details.
You will need to attend all unemployment appeal board hearings or the case might be dismissed.You should bring two copies of any written documents you might have, proving that you were fired without cause. Also, ask around to see if there are any witnesses that are willing to testify on your behalf.
You can have a lawyer or other professional present your case for you, but the fees might be too large to merit such assistance., If you are eligible for unemployment, you should also be eligible for COBRA. This is a type of temporary insurance, the costs of which will be split between yourself and your former employer.Also look for insurance on healthcare.gov. In some cases, this will be cheaper than COBRA.

, Prepare a complete resume with all of your most recent job information before you apply for new jobs. Add any skills you developed at your last job, as well as any job experience.


If you are at all unsure about the quality of your resume, do some research online or consider having a trusted friend look it over. It needs to be professional.
To maximize the impact of your resume, consider adding important job duties, projects, and accomplishments to the “experience” section.
You are not required to state in your resume how your employment ended. Do not indicate that you were fired unless directly asked by a prospective employer., Once you get over the initial shock of losing your job, get back out there. If it takes you a few weeks to get things in order, that’s okay; however, keep in mind that you may not land the first, second, or even third job for which you apply. The longer you are unemployed, the tougher it seems to get a new position – hiring managers take time between jobs into account.

, If you get called for an interview, review your resume and the job description for the position. This will prepare you to answer tough questions about your experience and position yourself as the person they are looking for.

, During an interview, you are likely to be asked why you left your least position. Be prepared to answer it honestly and professionally, in as positive a tone as possible. You do not need to provide a lengthy explanation; simply say that you were let go. Then, if you can do so honestly, follow up with “I left on good terms, and I am now looking for the right opportunity to utilize my strengths.”


Put a positive spin on your experience. Say that while you were disappointed to be let go, you feel you are lucky to have learned so much and developed new skills.
Do not talk negatively about your old boss. You never know what connections your old boss might have. It is also a good idea to show that you are a respectful employee.
Be honest and do not make up a story about your dismissal. Employers check references and will catch a lie., It is important to keep in mind that no matter how secure your job may seem, there is always a chance that something will happen and you will have to leave your position. Because of this, it is important to be prepared, just in case.


To be prepared, you should try to keep your resume as up to date as possible, and always have an eye on the job market in your field.

, As you hone your skills and gain more work experience, it is important to update your CV (or resume) to reflect your changing and developing abilities. It can be difficult to keep track of all of the work that you do and the projects you work on, so try to write down details in your CV as soon as you have finished the task or feel your skills have developed. For example.

, Along with your CV or resume, you should also keep your online profile(s) up to date. This means adding job experience and new skills as you develop them. Many companies look at online job profiles, like LinkedIn, when looking for new employees.


Respond to ‘friend’ requests in a timely fashion to show that you are interested in networking and are organized.

, Try to stay up to date on the job market and any advancements that occur in your industry. Even if you feel like your job is secure, it is still a good idea to keep a running tab on other positions you feel you would do well in.


Compare your own job to other positions to determine if you are being treated fairly. You might be surprised to find that people employed in positions similar to yours have higher or lower wages and benefits.

, Networking is an important practice when it comes to being prepared for the worst case scenario. The more connections you have, the more likely you will be to quickly find a job if you do happen to get fired. To network:


Appear at parties and networking functions.
Make connections online.
Be respectful and charismatic with people you meet.

"
Be honest about what happened.,
Soften your language.,
Describe the truth positively.,
Strive for simplicity.,
Be brief.,
Answer what is actually being asked.,
Don’t assign blame.,
Explain your employee status when terminated.,
Say if you were laid off.,
Secure a good reference from your terminated job.,
Show how you’ve learned.",How to Explain a Job Termination on Application," It is critical to be accurate when describing the circumstances of your job termination. For example, if you were fired, you should not say that you were laid off. If your prospective employer discovers that you misled them in describing your termination, it can damage your trustworthiness as a candidate and prospective employee.It is vital that what you say would be confirmed by your old employer in a reference check. Set yourself up for success by being as honest as possible.;
, You can describe your termination in less harsh terms while still being truthful. This will allow some distance between your candidacy and any unpleasant details of your termination.For example, rather than saying, “I was fired for stealing office supplies,” you can say, “Involuntary separation.” Rather than saying, “We both agreed I was bad at accounting and parted ways,” you can say, “Mutual separation.”

, If applicable, try to describe your termination in a light that might be positive for the job you’re applying for. For example, if you were fired from a grocery store for focusing too much on helping the customers and not enough on restocking the shelves, your focus on customer satisfaction could be seen as an asset for a job in customer service.You might say, “I was terminated from my job for spending too much time focusing on customer satisfaction, which is why I’ve decided to make my passion for helping customers the focus of my career going forward.”
Reframing how you understand your own termination can be helpful as you move forward in your career. Did you learn something valuable about yourself or interests through your termination? Let that shine through on your application.

, Simple explanations are usually easiest to understand, but job terminations are rarely simple matters. Try to distill the most important information about why you were terminated, so it’s easy for the hiring manager to understand and relate to others.If you’re prompted to provide an explanation for a termination, you could say, “My boss and I had different approaches to project planning,” rather than, “My old boss fired me because I couldn’t get projects done with no notice.”

, If you spend two paragraphs describing your termination, it could end up being the most memorable part of a short job application. Try to answer the questions you’re asked as fully but succinctly as possible for the most impact. For example, if you’re asked why you were laid off, you could say, “Office permanently closed,” rather than, “Our office was shut with little warning after supervisors decided Tulsa was a better location for the new servicing plant.”You are not obligated to provide additional information if it is not requested.

, Read the questions thoroughly and only answer the question that is being asked, not related questions that might seem corollary. For example, if an application asks, “Have you ever been terminated from a job?” You can simply answer yes. You do not need to add a lengthy description of why, especially if your parting was messy.

, Your job application is not a place to re-litigate your termination or say it was unjustified. Even if you feel you were treated unfairly or unprofessionally as part of an involuntary termination, rise above it for the purposes of your job application.Your prospective employer wants to know more about your character. By taking the high road, you will illustrate your ability to rebound professionally from trying circumstances.
It can be helpful to process the emotions related to your termination before starting the job hunt again.

, If you were terminated during a trial or probationary period, for example, that is important information for a prospective employer to know. Often employees in this trial situation are notified that they can be terminated “for any reason at any time.” Because of this, they are often let go off for more minor infractions or circumstantial reasons than a tenured employee., It can help a prospective employer feel at ease knowing you were terminated for circumstances unrelated to your individual job performance. If you were laid off because your entire satellite office was closed or the company experienced financial woes, for example, don’t hesitate to say so.Always ensure the information you provide about a layoff is accurate and doesn’t detour into fibbing or bad mouthing.

, Even if your former manager would not be a good reference for you, a good recommendation from a coworker or client from that company can make your prospective employer feel at ease.Securing a reference for a difficult period of time shows that you are not afraid to discuss challenging times with earnestness.
If your reference for a termination is stellar, you could offer them up on your application when describing your firing or layoff.

, If you’ve taken concrete steps to correct a shortcoming of yours that lead to termination, don’t be afraid to mention it. For example, if you were fired for subpar sales-revenue generation, you could mention that you’ve since taken a class or earned a certificate to improve your sales skills.


Illustrating how your termination has made you a better candidate speaks to your ability to tackle tough challenges and accept feedback gracefully.

Thank them for their “ideas” and carry on.,
Take advantage of their egos.,
Be cautious of false flattery.,
Document your ideas.,
Keep your personal life private.,
Deflect their attention-seeking.",How to Deal with Narcissists in the Workplace1," It can be hard to hear over and over again from your coworker that they have the best concept for a new project, or how you should really work with them to improve your skills. Rather than trying to get them to stop, take the passive route. Express your gratitude for their “help” and keep moving.


You might say, “That sounds like a great idea. I’ll think about that” or “Hmmm…I didn’t look at it that way. Thanks for sharing your perspective.”;
, Narcissists are known for being egomaniacs. You can leverage this seemingly negative trait, however. Stroke their ego a bit and use their high-confidence for the benefit of your team or office. Say, “You’re such a persuasive speaker, Jan. Why don’t you close the deal?”


Get the narcissist to pitch to clients. Have them take the lead on presentations. These people love to be in the spotlight, so use that to your advantage., As a rule of thumb, narcissists are self-absorbed and mainly out for themselves. They also lack empathy and have trouble relating to the emotional experience of others. What that means is they may manipulate you and have a hard time understanding why that’s not okay.Watch out for overly admiring compliments. If a narcissist strokes your ego, there’s a chance they want something from you. Your response to them should be quick and subdued. Say a quick, ""Thank you,"" and move on. Don't allow them to continue their efforts.
When a narcissist has used you to advance themselves, they will forget you exist.

, Narcissists have a tendency to hog the credit. To prevent this annoying characteristic from getting in the way of your work performance, be sure to note all your ideas on paper or through email. That way, you’ll have clear proof that your idea was lifted when they try to claim it as their own.Additionally, keep proof of which tasks were assigned to you and which were delegated to your narcissistic coworker so that they cannot blame their under-performance on you.


Consider sending an email after every meeting so that you can have documentation of what what discussed. This also allows you to add things that you want to discuss but may not have been able to say in the meeting because you were unable to get your point across due the the narcissist's need to dominate the discussion.
Keep the evidence in a file so that you can easily access it if you need to prove the work you've done.

, Narcissists are skilled at teasing out sensitive information to use against you later. Protect yourself by maintaining a detached, surface-level relationship with this person. No matter how genuine they seem, you will not be able to buddy up to them unless they have a purpose for you. Find emotional support elsewhere.Make a list of safe topics to discuss with them, such as sports, weather, events in the news, and other mundane topics.
It's important that you maintain a pleasant working relationship with them, so interact with them in a friendly manner.

, Narcissists crave attention, so it’s common for them to try to get it from those around them. While you may indulge them occasionally to keep the peace, you need to set boundaries to keep them from dominating your time and eroding your sanity.

When you have a meeting with them, schedule it close to another meeting that you can use as an excuse to leave on time. Choose a meeting that is less formal so that you don’t have the threat of looking bad at work hanging over your head.
Acknowledge what they are saying and move on without continuing the conversation. Say, “That’s great!” “I’m glad to hear your idea was successful!” “At least it’s almost Friday!” or “I hope it gets better.”
If you can, find a designated “escape” place to do your work on days that your narcissistic coworker is persistently bothering you.

If someone asks you for your input on some text they have put together, then firstly consider whether you are: The right person to ask.,
Its then important, if you are going to help, to ensure you read whatever has been written in context and have a little background understanding of what is trying to be conveyed, whether it's a business document or an insurance claim:


What are they writing?,
Detach yourself emotionally from the situation as best you can, when you talk with the person you are trying to help be aware of their mental state and approach accordingly.

,
People generally are still about 4 years old mentally when it comes to criticism so treat them as you would any child and fill them firstly with praise for what they already done before suggesting alternatives.

,Backup any suggestions with a positive reinforcement to explain reasons

,
Try not to make changes for the sake of it or detract praise for what they have done by saying something like ""Just give it to me and let me do it!"",
Make comments that refer to yourself also to reiterate the fact that you aren't perfect like ""To be honest if I were you I'd have written the same thing but it might be better like this?""",How to Edit a Co Worker's Writing Without Hurting Their Feelings," Are you too close to the situation?, or have a vested interest? Are you 'in the mood' for such a task? Do you already have a dislike for the person asking for the favour?.. all of these factors may be a good reason to turn to that person and say ""I'm sorry I can't"" and if needs be make an excuse to save their feelings e.g. ""I'm afraid I don't have the time right now"";

Maintain your composure and state your feelings.,
Stay solution-focused.,
Offer feedback sandwiched between compliments.,
Try to stay on their good side.",How to Deal with Narcissists in the Workplace2," Losing your head with a narcissist won’t be good for your health or your job. Don’t enter into a conflict situation when you are upset. Give yourself a moment to cool off before talking with the narcissist. Then, lead with your feelings.


Narcissists have trouble deciphering others’ emotions, so by starting with how you feel, you will put them off their game in order to get your point across.
For example, say, “I’m very disappointed that you went behind my back and met with our client. I thought we were going at this as a team. Can you explain yourself?”, Narcissists have a pesky habit of talking about a problem like a broken record, and generally focusing on how they have been wronged. They tend to dwell on the issue without ever moving into the problem-solving phase. If you have to problem-solve with this person, know that you will be responsible for shifting the focus to solutions.


Avoid accusing the narcissist or dwelling on the problem. Just present some viable answers.Once you start working on a solution, ignore any attempts they make to bring up the conflict again. Silence is the best option to get them to stop obsessing and move on.
If you have to redirect them to the solution, say, ""I know that we disagree, and that's okay. Right now our time is best spent planning for the future.""

, A narcissist is deeply affected by any sort of criticism. If you must offer constructive criticism on their performance, do so with care. They may respond with anger or excuses. Alternatively, they may respond with subtle, passive-aggressive behavior after the fact.Try to ignore this as best as you can.One method is delivering criticism in the sandwich method—that is, between two positive statements. For instance, you might say, “Joel, I noticed you have been working really hard this week. I realized that you submitted several reports in late. I need you to do better with sticking to the deadlines. Other than that, you performance has been terrific. Thanks.”
There’s still a chance that their ears will skip over the bad part and only hear the highlights, but at least you will have gotten through it without an explosive reaction.

, Even perceived slights can warrant total obliteration in a narcissist’s eyes. They will pull out all the stops to sabotage your work reputation and leave your career in shambles. The sad thing is, with their superficial charm and ability to win over others, no one may believe you if you try to expose their dirty deeds. Just try to stay on their good side or off their radar completely.While you should present yourself as assertive and confident, the point is to not preempt conflict with the narcissist. Be professional in your interactions and engage with them on a need-to basis.
For example, the narcissist might take it personally if they are overlooked for a promotion that you get. Knowing how envious and manipulative they can be, you might pull them aside and try to relieve any building tension, ""Hey, Jamie, I know you wanted the promotion. Honestly, I'm surprised you didn't get it. But I do hope this doesn't affect our work relationship moving forward.""

Develop a strong support group.,

Keep notes or evidence of any abuse.,
Leave the workplace if your health and well-being are threatened.",How to Deal with Narcissists in the Workplace3," Working with a narcissist can be draining. Balance your workdays by going home to people who value and support you. This may translate to coworkers with whom you are friendly, family members, non-work friends, or a significant other. Lift your spirits by making regular plans after work to be with people you care about and vice versa., Spending 40+ hours each week around someone who dominates conversations, exploits others, and constantly gloats can be a hit to your self-worth. It’s easy to feel like you and other coworkers have faded into the background when a narcissist takes center stage. Counteract any threats to your self-esteem by reminding yourself of your positive attributes.Make a list of your best traits. Place the list in your car visor or in your handbag or wallet. You can also keep a digital version in your phone. Review the list whenever you need reminding of why you are valuable and effective at your job, or at life, in general.
Engage in hobbies or activities that play to your talents and help you feel better about yourself. You could try a local sports league, art classes, volunteering, or anything else that makes you feel good.

, Even if you avoid being competitive with a narcissist, they may exaggerate a perceived slight that pits you against them. If a narcissist is waging war against you in the workplace, it’s best to document everything. If this ever gains the attention of your boss, you want to be able to show proof of any abuse.Save emails and notes of criticism or harassment. Ask other coworkers for eyewitness statements when they observe the narcissist playing dirty. This may be the only way to save your job if the narcissist decides to sabotage you.

, Working with a narcissist can create a toxic working environment for everyone nearby. If a narcissist has targeted you as their biggest competitor or is already starting to sabotage your work, you may feel as if your sanity is at risk. It may be best to switch departments or quit your job altogether. If you love your job, visit a mental health professional. They may be able to help you work on the issues you need to resolve to keep your job, or they can help you transition to a new one.


If you have adequately documented their misdeeds, you may stand a chance discussing the matter with your superiors. If not, they will likely present their best face and have the boss on their side."

, Don't be ashamed to let them know you are out of work. They know your skills best and may have referrals for you.

, You've worked hard to acquire the knowledge and expertise you utilized everyday at your job. Other companies and businesses need that same knowledge and expertise.

Determine your institution's goals and objectives.,
Analyze your own personal goals and processes.,
Investigate the theory of coterie.,
Engage in risk assessment.,
Develop strategies.,
Expand into a vacuum.,
View the institution from the perspective of leadership.,
Support the best efforts of fellow members.,
Support all criticism and recommendation for change.,
Be anxious to evaluate, to be evaluated.",How to Create Conditions for Change," Knowing your enemy is a key aspect of military strategy, which applies well here. The individual must determine what the goals of the institution are. This assumes both stated and real goals. An understanding of the goals helps focus individual action. If some goals are mutually held, well and good: let that be a definable point of confluence. When goals are not commonly held, define clearly the goals and their differences and use this data as part of a plan to act. The same applies for institutional process, how the institution does things. Define this clearly, painstakingly. Identify points of agreement and disagreement. Focus on individual priorities. Unless this analysis is carefully done and continually revised, the individual flounders, lacks focus, and grasps at straws. Tremendous energy is wasted, dissipated, and the individual is left ineffective, often frustrated and bitter, and all for no apparent reason.;
, Implied in the above strategy is a personal goals and processes definition. What is the individual about? What are the goals? What does the individual believe in passionately? What significantly? What not at all? How much ego-tripping is involved? How comfortable is the individual with self? Why relate to an institution at all? Why this institution? How do the goals converge? How do they grate?

, Early in encountering an institution, identify like-minded people who may become mutual supporters. This need not take on the aspect of a conspiracy, but it may. Conspiracy is a word with two Latin roots meaning ""breathing together,"" not a bad idea at all. One example of the effectiveness of this strategy is Bell Kaufman's case in Up the Down Staircase. The teacher seeks to survive and affect a hostile New York City high school. Her one friend in the school supports her, sends her silly notes, encourages, understands and cares for her. Kaufman seems only minimally aware that her effect on the friend is mutual. Support groups, coteries, can be two or more persons who share goals. The support system, which evolves, may be formal or informal. The effect can be personal support, confrontation, stroking, and caring. It can also be intellectual support, challenging assumptions, clarifying goals, testing hypotheses, and designing strategy. The latter support system is the conspiracy model, although be open to collaboration with others, especially leadership! It may have both the active intellectual attributes and the personal support mechanisms.

, Some situations can be diagnosed early as unworkable for some individuals. The energy consumed in seeking to resolve the unresolvable is unreasonable. Personal and institutional growth comes from struggle and risk. The resolution of the conflicts should be possible before mammoth commitment is made. It is important as the individual considers affiliations with an institution to assess the risks involved. What are the worst things that can happen to me? What are the best things? What are the implications of failure, personally and professionally? Is the risk worth the taking? There is no point in risking all for a soggy marshmallow. Significant influence upon institutions usually implies significant risk. Determining which are the significant risks and taking them is the essence of the art of the change-making individual. Excellence is always worth the effort, but may not be worth the cost.

, When a clear awareness of individual and institutional goals has been gained, a specific strategy and set of strategies is possible. The strategies depend upon goals, possible ties within the institution and skills of the individual. Strategies need in-flight correction mechanisms so that the strategy can respond to change as the need arises. The strategy should have a reasonable margin of success and be clearly defined.

, This strategy was developed and effected with brilliance by Fred Demara, the Great Impostor. He reasoned that the individual could succeed in the institution as long as the individual did not threaten anyone. Creative thrusts were always into uncharted territory, and he always gave as wide credit as possible to everyone available. He advised never to intimidate, never to covet the job or prerogatives of others, always to develop new and complementary modes. Demara, of course, developed a number of other strategies based upon his correct perception of institutional ineffectiveness. Many of these strategies reflected his own special talent and ethical system.

, Institutional leaders have unique perspectives and problems as they see the institution and its function. In order to understand their decisions and influence, their perspective must be sought. Sometimes this new data brings about new and comforting understanding. Sometimes the data makes more clear institutional goals that are contrary to individual goals. In either event, the data is valuable for strategic reasons.

, In a spirit of sharing and concern for others, offer the widest possible support to those who are seeking to meet goals compatible with your own; collaborate whenever possible. The positive value of the action benefits the individual, the institution, and the other folk involved.

, Be prepared to deal with questions and concerns from all conceivable perspectives as you move to change the institution. Consider carefully before hand; reflect rather than defend. Document what you say from several points of view.

, When the individual initiates evaluation, the individual can control the processes of evaluation. If the individual is open to evaluation and scrutiny, then others cannot force an evaluation according to criteria and process which would be skewed against the individual's interest. Shape evaluation to be compatible with mandated assessments where-ever possible.

Take the plunge.",How to Downsize Your Own Job," If you want a job with less stress and fewer hours, chances are you will also be getting paid less. Calculate your monthly outgoings (how much you spend) and see if there are any cutbacks in spending you are willing to make.


For example you may find you don’t need your monthly gym membership as you don’t have the time to go anyway. Decide on a final figure for your minimum monthly income so that you can tailor your job search to that specific need.;
, Thinking about what you dislike about your current job can help you to determine what you want in a new job. Do you want to downsize your entire job, or are there just some parts of it that need to change? Do you like what you do, but wish you could work part-time rather than full-time?


Asking yourself these questions will help you tailor your job search (which will be covered in the next section).
Are looking for a less stressful job.
Are looking for a job where they can work fewer hours.
Are hoping to work part-time rather than full-time.

, If you like your company, you may want to consider looking for openings within your company. If you would like to be part-time rather than full-time, find out if your company has a job sharing initiative. Talk with your boss, and just like if you were looking for a promotion, state your interest in taking a new role. However, explain why you want to move ‘down’ or ‘sideways’ on the job ladder instead of further up.


Explain the circumstances that are making you want to downsize, such as a new baby or a sick parent who you want to care for. Being honest will help your boss to understand what you want and why.

, When you begin thinking about downsizing, take some time to explore the job market and see what positions are available. This is particularly important to do if you are thinking about changing industries.


Run online searches through job search engines.
Talk to people working in the industry you would like to try out.
Set up meetings with a job counselor to discuss your options.

, Once you have an idea of the kind of jobs that are available, begin a more specific job search based on the aspects of your desired job and how much you would like to downsize. While searching, keep in mind things like:


Salary.
Hours.
Flexibility.
Contract type.

, When you find a job posting that you are interested in, take the time to look at the company. While the job posting may sound intriguing, if the company comes across as inflexible or incompatible with the reasons you are downsizing in the first place, you may consider looking for a job elsewhere.


Read the company’s mission statement, history, and any other information you can find about them. If possible, talk with someone who has worked or is working at the company.

, You might find that you have transferable skills for a number of new positions. If you are not sure if you have the right skills for a specific job, consider looking into short term and temporary contracts in your desired field.


These short-term jobs can give you an idea of what it is like to work in that industry and help you to determine if you have the right skills.

, If you don’t mind moving companies but would like to stay in your current industry, you should consider looking for freelance jobs. Freelancing can give you the freedom to control how much work you take on and how much you charge, which could help reduce stress and time constraints.

, Once you have found a few jobs you would like to apply for, you will have to rewrite your resume to suit these jobs. If you are staying in your same industry but are hoping to move down on the totem pole, consider rewriting your resume so that it only contains the skills and experience that are relevant to your specific job.


You can consider leaving out more demanding or prestigious positions you have held if they do not particularly apply to the position. Doing this will help you to avoid being labeled “overqualified”.

, If you are thinking about making a move into a completely different industry, you should tailor your essay so that it reflects all of your transferable skills (skills that you picked up in your current industry that also apply to the industry you are applying to).


Again, only focus on experience that is relevant to the job, even if it means leaving out more prestigious experience.

, Applying to several different jobs at once can help increase your chances of getting hired. While it can be time consuming, tailoring your resume and (if needed) cover letter to the specific job you are applying for is very important.


Take time to very carefully read the job description and write your cover letter based on what is listed in the description.

, If you are requested to appear for an interview, think of it as both a step towards getting a job, and a way to make sure that the company is compatible with your reasons for downsizing. Make sure to bring a copy of your important documents, like your resume or examples of your work.


When going to the interview, dress in clothes that are suitable for the job role; business casual is standard, unless the company is very prestigious, or you are applying for a job that requires you to wear a specific set of clothes (like hiking boots for the position of a park ranger).

, If the job you are interviewing for is significantly less challenging or demanding than your last job, it is important to explain your reasons for applying, particularly if the salary is also much less. Sharing your personal reasons will help your potential employer to understand. For example, discussing the fact that you want to spend time with your kids, or would prefer to work in a less stressful environment, will help the interviewer to understand your reasons.


Be gracious in your interview and take care not to come across as ‘overqualified’ or like this job is beneath your skill levels, as it most likely won’t impress the employer if they think you are looking at this as an easy job or ‘a step down’ from your current position.

, Once you get a job offer, double check the salary, contract, benefits and policies to make sure this is the right move for you. Be sure to accept this offer and obtain a starting date before you tell your current job. When resigning, be sure to follow the company’s policies and remain professional.

Relish the work when you get it.",How to Deal with Being Fired," Though you may be feeling intense feelings of rage or anger, it’s important not to insult or yell at your boss or others in the office. Once your boss or HR supervisor tells you the news, try to swallow any anger in the moment.Getting upset at your boss or your co workers will only damage your reputation and create a scene. Rather than get mad, focus on getting out of the meeting with some measure of dignity.
Do not get physical with your boss. No matter how angered you may by your firing, harming your boss could result in arrest.;
, There is a big difference between getting laid off and getting fired. Find out the specific reasons why your superiors decided to fire you, rather than lay you off. Was it because of your attitude in the workplace? One specific event or account that went sideways? Or downsizing and cost cutting?Posts on various social media accounts can often result in firings. If the content on the post(s) could be considered offensive, the company may not want to be associated with you anymore and may let you go.
Determining the reason behind your firing will help you understand why you are being fired. It will also allow you to improve in a certain area in your next job or role.

, Once you are told you are being fired, your boss will likely hand you a stack of pink slip paperwork. These are official papers concerning your employment contract, which you will have to sign. But hold off on signing the severance package, if it is offered to you.Take the time to look it over and run it by your lawyer. You may be able to negotiate a higher severance payment, especially if you have been with the company or organization for a long period of time.

, This is especially important to talk about if you have been with the company in a high paying position for a long period of time, or if you are in a role where you work directly with clients or customers.


If you have built a relationship with certain clients, you want to be sure the company explains your firing in a way that is honest, but does not burn your reputation.
It is also important to clarify your departure so you know how your former employer will explain your firing to future employers who call them for a reference.
If you don’t want your employer to be a reference for any future jobs you apply for, specify that you just want them to confirm your dates of employment at the company and nothing more.

, This maybe difficult to do, especially after the initial sting of being fired. But try to stay on good terms with your employer, even if you may be upset. You don’t want to burn any bridges for the future and end your professional relationship with your boss on a sour note.

, Avoid roaming around the office and telling your co-workers you just got fired. This looks unprofessional and may cause friction between you and your former employer. Gather your belongings in a cardboard box, or only take the essentials with you. Then, head for the nearest exit.Take the time to call up your closest co-workers that evening and say your goodbyes. Or make arrangements to meet up with them outside of the office.
When gathering your items and leaving the office, do so calmly. Not in an angry or emotional way.

, In most states, you can qualify for unemployment benefits if you weren’t let go due to intentional misconduct.Look up your state’s policy on unemployment benefits to determine if you qualify.

, It may be painful to admit at first. But saying “I was fired” out loud to yourself or to others can help you process the trauma of being fired. Unload the negative feelings you have towards getting fired by admitting it to yourself and to others in an open way.


Be honest if a potential employer asks you how you left your old job. Explain the specific details around the reasons for your firing, but stress that you left the company on good terms. This will show the potential employer you are willing to be honest and upfront, but can still be professional.

, Focus on your relationships with your partner, your family members, and your close friends. Avoid dealing with your stress and anger alone.Don't be afraid to open up to your friends and family about the trauma of being fired. Though you may be tempted to isolate yourself and try to tackle your feelings on your own, you may need to turn to your loved ones for support, and that's okay.

, Talking about getting fired with your partner, your family or close friends can definitely help you deal with the trauma of being fired. But professional help from a therapist or counselor will help you work through any anger issues you may have as a result of being fired.Though you may be tempted to focus on moving forward, it’s important to deal with any intense emotions you may have due to getting fired. That way, you can move forward in a healthy and stable way.

, The ""what if"" thinking can be easy to fall into. ""What if I had just not been late for that one meeting?"" ""What if I had done more over time?"" But living in the past will not help you move forward. ""What ifs"" are impossible to answer and will stall your ability to re focus on the positive aspects of your life.Rather than think of ""what ifs"", think about ""what now's"". As in, ""what can I now do with my open time?"" ""what can I now do to move forward and succeed?""

, Use this open time to decompress and de-stress by doing activities you never had the time or energy to do before. Try not to fall into a routine of inactivity or lethargy.Read a book you’ve been meaning to get to to or participate in a recreational volleyball game you always had to miss due to work.Declutter your home and donate anything you don’t need. Go for walks in the morning and give yourself time to enjoy your sudden free time.
Get a gym membership or take free classes at your local YMCA. Burn up any stress by pouring your energy into sports or social activities with friends.

, To be safe and proactive, assume you may not land another job in the next several months. Sit down and go over your monthly budget. Look at any money in a savings account, or in investments. Decide how you are going to maintain your standard of living without steady income for several months.You may want to get your financial planner involved in this process. Or seek out legal advice from your lawyer.
If you are receiving severance pay from your former employer, factor this into your budget for the coming months. But try not to live primarily on your severance pay. You want to be careful not to depend too heavily on your savings or investments to keep you afloat as you search for a new job.

, Did you enjoy your last job or position? Or do you feel like you might want to try a different career? Consider how happy you were in your former position and if you may be happier doing something else., If you are thinking about a career change, its important to make a list of the skills you gained in your previous position. For example, if you worked in an admissions office, but now want to get into sales, you have valuable people skills and communication skills. These are your transferable skills.If you aren’t sure what your transferable skills are, you can do a self-assessment test. Look up career assessment tests online.You can also do a self-assessment on your own. Think about what would be the best next step in your career and what would make you happy. Consider why an employer would want to hire you and what skills you can offer an employer.

, This may be updating your resume and your online profile. You may also focus on attending business get togethers to network. Let everyone you know that you are in the job market again and work every contact you have.

, It can be a challenge to build up your confidence again after being fired. But conducting a job interview on yourself can help you get more comfortable with marketing your skills to potential employers. Ask yourself questions like:What are my weaknesses? This is the most common interview question and one of the most difficult to answer. Focus on professional development, rather than personal issues or faults. Include a solution to your weakness in your answer. For example: “I am working on getting better at public speaking, and just joined Toastmasters to work on this weakness.”
Why should someone hire me? Summarize your experiences into one sentence. For example: “With over five years’ experience working in the sales industry and my proven record of selling products, I could make a big difference in your company.”
What are my goals? Focus on short term goals and goals you can achieve in the next year. For example: “My immediate goal is to get a position at a growth-oriented sales company. My long term goal is to eventually grow into a position of responsibility and leadership.”

, Though you may be hesitate to accept a temporary position, consider your finances. If money is critical, a temporary job may be necessary and it may lead to better things. Temporary opportunities sometimes open the door to permanent opportunities.Rather than go towards what you know and have done before, embrace a new opportunity if it comes up. You don't know where the journey may lead unless you start down the path.

, Once you land your next position, appreciate it and focus on working hard. Seize the opportunity to work, especially if it is in a career you are happy doing and find fulfilling."

Ask about creating quiet areas.",How to Deal With Annoying Colleagues," Be extremely polite to the person no matter what they say. If you engage, you're only making the problem worse. Plus, you could get into an argument with the person that gets you in trouble with your boss., One way to deal with any annoying thing in your life is to just ignore it if you can. Of course, sometimes that's not possible, as the problem impacts your life too much. However, everyone has little annoyances in your day, so try to come up with a way to ignore problems if you don't want to make waves with coworkers.For instance, if your coworker talks too loudly on the phone, maybe you can try putting in noise-cancelling headphones with some soft, instrumental music to drown him out., That is, if you need to stop talking to a colleague, blame it on the fact that you have a deadline. Similarly, if you need to ask a co-worker to turn down a song (or conversation!), you could blame it on the fact that you need to make a phone call.However, try to make the suggestion politely. For instance, you could say, ""I hate to run, but I've got a deadline coming up at 5. Can I catch you later?"" or ""I enjoy having music on, but would you mind turning it down a little? I really need to make a phone call."", If your main problem with a coworker is conflicting personalities, work on finding things you agree on or things you have in common. One way you can work on this step is to ask the person about her hobbies or what pets she has at home. Finding common ground can help alleviate some friction., You have pet peeves just like everyone else. However, sometimes you may take it a little far. Look at the situation, and see if what the other person is doing really justifies your anger. You may realize that it's really not that big of a deal, and you should find a way to work around it., If you find yourself irrationally angry at something a coworker is doing, that is not the time to confront her. Wait until you've calmed down and have a clear head. You may decide that you don't even want to confront the person., You don't want to bring up a problem in the presence of twenty coworkers in the break room.However, if you think the confrontation could go badly, you might want to bring someone else along to help mediate or to at least witness the confrontation.

, You need to be polite but assertive. That is, you don't want to downplay the problem, but you don't want your coworker to feel like you are attacking him.For instance, if the problem is a coworker is playing music too loud, try approaching it this way: ""Can I speak to you for a minute? I'm sorry to bother you about this problem, but your music being so loud really distracts me from my work. Is it possible we can find a solution to this problem?""

, Don't drag in everything you think is wrong with the person. Stick to the facts. Also, don't name call or degrade the other person, as those actions are not professional and reflect badly on you., You can also lower the tension of the situation by cracking a joke. Usually, it's best to make the joke at your own expense, sort of putting you and the other person on the same playing field. That is, when you're bring up something negative about another person, you are creating a negative tension between you two. By cracking a joke, you can help erase some of that tension.For instance, if you've noticed they left a mess again in the kitchen, you could say something such as ""I noticed you left a mess in the kitchen. Would you mind cleaning it up? Don't worry, I'm just as bad. I'm such a slob sometimes; they may need to send in an excavation team for my dirty dishes at home, haha.""

, When you need to bring up something negative, try starting and ending positive. That way, your coworker doesn't go on the defensive when you first start talking to him, and he won't leave the conversation with a sour taste in his mouth.For instance, if your coworker won't be quiet about politics, maybe you could say, ""I love how enthusiastic you are about your political beliefs. However, you are making some people uncomfortable who don't share your views. Could you maybe save that conversation for after work? It's great how passionate you are; few people care that much.""

, In every relationship, you have to give as much as you take. Therefore, if you're demanding that your coworker give up something, try to offer something in return. For instance, if you ask your coworker to turn her music down, try saying you'll also wear headphones to help the problem., Trying to out-annoy the other person is likely to end badly. For instance, if you don't like that someone is playing her music too loudly, increasing the volume on your music isn't going to solve the problem. Plus, it will get other coworkers annoyed at you., If direct confrontation isn't your thing, you can still find away to approach the problem. One good way to do that is to bring it up in a work meeting as a general office problem.For instance, you could say, ""I've noticed the noise level in the office has gone up dramatically lately. Could everyone please pay attention to the amount of noise you're creating?""

, Ask yourself one question first: ""Is what the person is doing negatively affecting my work?"" If it isn't, don't get your boss involved. If it is, figure out how it is in a specific way, such as ""The noise level is affecting my ability to meet deadlines because I find it distracting."", Try to pick a time when your boss doesn't have a huge deadline or is dashing between meetings. Sometimes, that's impossible because your boss is always busy. If that's the case, try shooting her an email to ask when a good time to chat would be. That way, she can set up a good time., Managers here complaints all day long. If you come in with a complaint, it may go in one ear and out the other. Instead, try to focus on finding a solution rather than making a complaint. That is, frame it in a positive way.For instance, say you are complaining that your coworker tends to talk very loudly outside your office, making it difficult to concentrate. You could say, ""I hate to bring it up with you because I know you are busy. I'm involved with a conflict with another coworker. I don't want to complain; rather, I'm want to help find a solution. Basically, we're having a conflict over how much noise should be allowed in the main parts of the office. I was hoping maybe you could help us find a solution or maybe mediate between the two of us. We have tried to resolve it, but we haven't found the right solution yet. Thank you for hearing me out.""

, If your company has created a boisterous, noisy environment, your boss might not feel the need to tell someone to quiet down. However, try asking if you can set up quiet areas for people who feel like you do. That way, you can have a quiet place to go collect your thoughts."

Apply for unemployment.",How to Cope with Unemployment1," Start by listing necessities: rent, groceries, insurance, and utilities. Next, list expenses that are important but non-essential. These might include cable TV, eating out, alcohol and cigarettes, and movies. Add up the amount you spend on necessities and add it to the amount you spend on non-essentials. This number represents your current monthly expenses.If you’re not sure how much you spend on certain items, look at your credit card or bank statements. They will list out the items you have purchased in previous months.;
, Starting with your non-essentials category, find areas where you can cut back on your spending. For example, you might decide to forgo eating out during your unemployment, or you might decide to cancel your cable TV subscription. Cut out as many expenses are you can manage.You should continue to budget a small amount of money for non-essentials. The goal is to reduce your expenses, not necessarily eliminate them altogether.

, To help stay within your budget, cut coupons, pack your lunch instead of eating out, and call your phone company to see if they offer a hardship discount.


Coupons can be found in weekly mailers or online.Don’t be afraid to ask for discounts. Remember, your situation is neither unique nor shameful. Most companies, like credit card companies or phone companies, will be happy to work with you if you ask. You can improve your chances of getting a discount on your payment by pointing to your positive payment history with the company.

, If you have credit card bills or student loans, call the loan companies and ask if you can reduce your monthly payments, or delay them entirely until you find employment. Many credit card companies will give you thirty-to-ninety days of deferral where they will not charge you interest. Student loan servicers are often even more accommodating and will allow you to defer any payment during the course of your unemployment.To find out if a company offers loan deferment, call the customer service number on your bill (or on the back of your credit card) and explain your situation to the representative.

, If you have an extra room in your house, consider taking in a roommate. This will reduce one of your largest expenses—rent. You can find roommates by advertising on websites like Craigslist or by placing ads in your local paper.Meet with and interview potential roommates before you offer them the room. Ask about their sources of income as well as their philosophy on cleaning and paying bills on time.
If you own your home, renting out an extra room in your house can decrease your mortgage payment.

, If you were laid off from you job for no fault of your own, you may qualify for unemployment. Unemployment will generally provide you with half of your previous salary for a set amount of time.If you were fired for cause or quit your job voluntarily, you may not qualify for unemployment.

Give yourself time to accept the end of your career.,
Don't be ashamed of feeling sad and angry.,
Try writing or keeping a journal.,
Try breathing exercises that reduce anxiety and depression.,
Consider seeing a counselor.,
Don’t self-medicate or abuse any substances.",How to Cope with the End of a Dance or Sports Career1," Grieving a loss is different from person to person. The way you respond may depend on the length of your career, your emotional investment in your career, and the reason your career ended. Don't rush things, but take the time you need to emote, process your feelings, and gain acceptance. Remind yourself that life goes on and, in time, you will find happiness and self-worth outside of your dance or athletic career., Allow yourself to experience emotions, like anger, frustration, or sadness. Avoid minimizing your emotions or being ashamed of them. Let yourself emote, but try not to dwell: experience emotions then work to move on with your life.Keep in mind that your grief will not suddenly disappear one day. You may start to have more good days as your emotions resolve over time, but you may also go back and forth between good days and bad days.

, Writing can be a helpful way to both experience and release your emotions. You can try a couple of different strategies to help process your grief:Write down your feelings on a piece of paper, then burn it or otherwise destroy it. Imagine that the burning paper symbolizes the process of releasing your emotional burden.
Keep a journal to vent your feelings of grief and read your past entries to track your progress. Try not to dwell on the feelings you’ve expressed, but focus on the progress you’ve made through grief’s stages.

, Sit in a comfortable position, and breathe slowly but naturally for a bit to relax yourself. When you’re relaxed, breath deeply and expand your belly as you visualize a color you find happy or calming. Count to four as you breath in, hold your breath for a four count and, as you slowly exhale, tighten your abdominal muscles to squeeze out all the air in your body.Imagine letting go of your feelings of worry, sadness, or frustration as you squeeze your breath out. When you inhale, envision yourself filling up with calmness, hope, and strength.
Set aside about 20 minutes to do your breathing exercises free of any distractions. Wear loose clothing that won’t restrict your breathing. Do your exercises daily, or whenever you feel anxious or depressed.

, A counselor can help tailor your coping process and provide you with specialized support that you may not get from family or friends. It’s normal to feel like loved ones can’t relate to what you’re going through. Talking to a grief counselor or therapist who specializes in dance or sports psychology can offer the comfort of knowing someone understands your struggle.Try using the online search tools at Good Therapy (http://www.goodtherapy.org/find-therapist.html) or Psychology Today (https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/).
Search online for “sports psychologist” or “dance psychologist” near your location. Specialists in these areas, including psychologists who were former dancers or athletes, are becoming more common. You can also try asking your team or dance company for a referral to mental health professional who has experience with dancers or athletes.

, Self-medicating with drugs or alcohol can be a tempting coping mechanism, especially if you’ve suffered a career-ending injury. However, they'll only isolate you, damage your health, and keep you from processing your grief.Well-meaning friends may offer to take you out drinking to get your mind off of things. However, this is not a healthy way to cope. You might want to tell friends that you are avoiding alcohol for a while to ensure that you cope with your emotions in a healthy way.
Seek counseling if you have any issues with self-medicating or addiction.

Stay in touch with friends and family.,
Wake up early.,
Exercise daily.,
Practice stress reduction techniques.,
Ask for help.,
Reduce alcohol and other drugs.",How to Cope with Unemployment2," It’s important to maintain a support structure during this difficult time. Although you may feel embarrassed to tell your friends and family about your unemployment, they will likely provide you encouragement and support while you search for a new job. They may also be able to help you find a new job. Make a point of getting lunch or dinner with a friend at least once a week.If your friends and family usually get together for activities that cost money, suggest cheaper alternatives, such as sandwiches over steak or coffee over lattes. Also take the initiative to suggest free activities like going for a hike or visiting a free museum.

, Without a set routine, you may be tempted to sleep in and you may also be tempted to go to bed later and later, which may interfere with your ability to return to a normal sleep schedule. Resist this temptation. Waking up early—around the same time you woke up during your previous employment—will help you to stay in a healthy routine and avoid the possibility of depression.If you have trouble waking up early without a set task to accomplish, make one for yourself. Plan your workouts in the morning, or decide that you will spend two hours job-hunting from 9 a.m. to 11. a.m. every week day.
Make sure that you leave the house at least once per day as well. This may help to keep depression at bay.

, Exercise is one of the best stress relievers. Get at least thirty minutes of exercise every day. If you can engage in social exercise activities like group sports or a bike team, even better. You’ll get the benefits of exercise and the benefits of social interaction in one activity.If you’re unable to afford a gym membership because of your unemployment, you have options. Many YMCAs will offer reduced rates to people who are unemployed.
Other options include jogging or biking outside, or playing Frisbee, soccer, or other sports at a local park.

, Meditation, yoga, or prayer are effective ways to combat stress. If you have stress reduction techniques that have worked for you in the past, use those. Otherwise, don’t be afraid to seek out new ways of coping with stress.


If you’ve never meditated before, there are many resources available online that can help you get started. Additionally, you may be able to find a meditation center in your town that offers free classes.
As a simple relaxation exercise, sit in a quiet room and close your eyes. You can sit in a chair or sit cross-legged on the floor—whichever is more comfortable. Breathe normally. Focus your attention on your breath moving in and out of your lungs. Maintain this position for five-to-ten minutes.

, If you feel overwhelmed by your situation, reach out to friends or family for help. If you’d rather talk to someone who doesn’t know you, you can find a therapist in your area. If you don’t have insurance, then try a community mental health center in your area.


Don’t wait until you’re desperate to seek help. Instead, reach out for help when you first start to feel depressed or anxious about your situation.
If you can’t afford a therapist, there may be free options in your town. You can find free therapy options by contacting social services. Another option is to visit a local community hospital, if you have one, and ask about their therapy options for people with low incomes.
Your spouse or children may also feel stressed out by your situation. Make sure to tell them that you’re there for them and offer them the same resources you would seek for yourself. Avoid taking your emotions about this out on your spouse. Have another family member or friend that you also talk to about your situation to spread the emotional weight around and avoid putting it all on your spouse.

, While alcohol, cigarettes, and other drugs can provide temporary relief from stress, they tend to increase stress in the long-term. Alcohol is also a depressant, so you should avoid drinking too much during a time that you are feeling low already.You don’t need to cut alcohol or cigarettes out of your life entirely. In fact, you should avoid doing this during your unemployment as stopping these drugs is a stressful event. Instead, simply try to reduce your intake slightly and don’t let yourself drink more than you normally would.

Make a plan.,
Update your resume.,
Be flexible.,
Make a good impression on employers.,
Learn new skills.",How to Cope with Unemployment3," You should treat finding a new job like a job in itself. Budget several hours each day, at a set time, to search for jobs. For example, you might decide that you will spend one hour each day at 1 p.m. making a list of five jobs that you’re interested in. Then, from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. you will fill out applications for those five jobs., Take some time to improve your resume and tailor it to the jobs you’re interested in. If you’re planning to change your line of work, edit your previous employment to emphasize skills that will be relevant to the new line of work.For example, if you were a computer programmer in your previous job and you’re hoping to get into investment banking, emphasize the analytical skills required in your previous jobs.

, Depending on your financial situation, you may need to accept jobs that aren’t your dream job. At the beginning of your job search, it’s OK to apply only for jobs that you really want. If a few months go by and you’re still unemployed, you should consider taking a job that isn’t exactly what you’re looking for.For example, if you’re searching for a job in programming but you’re getting no offers, consider applying for jobs in IT instead.
Remember that a non-ideal job doesn’t have to be permanent and it may end up leading to other opportunities.

, Employers will want to know why you’re experiencing a period of unemployment. Get in front of the issue by listing it on your resume and having an honest story to tell during interviews.


For example, on your resume you might write, “Laid off due to budget cut-backs. Seeking employment daily for the last two months.”
In an interview, explain to your potential employer what you’ve been doing with your free time. Emphasize any activities that might be selling points. For example, you might say, “I usually apply to five-to-ten jobs a week. In my spare time, I’ve been learning how to program in HTML.”

, If you want to develop new skills, unemployment is a good time to consider going back to school. Think about what kind of jobs you want and choose a program that will give you the skills you need to get hired.Avoid going back to school just to fill time. If you go back to school without a goal in mind, you may just end up accumulating more debt. You can also look for certificate programs or specialized training conferences that are shorter-term and will help hone your skills and make you an attractive candidate.
Schooling is an additional expense, but there are many resources available to help fund your education. If you have a low income you may qualify for federal grants that you don’t have to repay. If you don’t qualify, you may be able to get low-interest loans through the federal government. Fill out the FAFSA application to find out what aid you qualify for.

Stay connected to your support system.,
Don’t be discouraged by setbacks.,
Make a list of your other favorite qualities.,
Visualize your future life experiences.",How to Cope with the End of a Dance or Sports Career2," It’s easy to lose your sense of self-identity and confidence and, as a result, isolate yourself. However, you must challenge yourself to remain connected to your friends, family, former teammates, and other members of your support system. Resist feeling isolated, disconnected, or unsure of yourself.Reach out to someone when you need to, whether it’s a family member, old teammate, or your counselor. You could call a friend and say, ""My confidence level is really low today, and I could really use a friend. I know I want to discover a new sense of purpose, but I don't even know where to start. Do you have time to grab a coffee or just chat on the phone for a bit?""
If you want to talk about your feelings, you should. However, just spending time with loved ones can comfort you and remind you that you are connected to other people.
Keep in mind that it is okay if you don’t feel like spending as much time with people, but it is a good idea to continue to maintain some social involvement. Try to spend time with friends and family as you normally would, even if you have to set a time limit or have some quiet time after to recover.

, Many former dancers and athletes treat coping with the end of their career like a performance or game: you either do the right dance step or not, or you either win the game or not. This either/or, linear way of thinking can leave you feeling even less confident or like you’re doing something wrong if you have trouble coping.Instead of thinking that there are right and wrong ways of coping, remember that everyone copes differently. Think of coping as an open process. Accept that you might have setbacks and bad days, but try not to let them define you.

, Your dance or athletic career becomes a major part of your identity, but you should remember that you are a unique person with many other talents and qualities. Take some time to reflect and write a list of things about yourself that you admire.You could list your core values, like honesty, sense of duty, or humor. You could write down your relationships with other people, like being a parent, son or daughter, sibling, or best friend. List your other talents or hobbies, like being great at board games, gardening, bike riding, or music.
Carry this list with you and read over it regularly, especially when you start to feel down. You can also post it somewhere that you will see it often, such as on your computer monitor or on a mirror.

, Athletic and dance careers typically end relatively early in life, and you should celebrate this fact. Take time to feel proud of your many accomplishments at such a young age and realize that you are off to a great start towards accomplishing your life goals. It can be daunting to think, “What am I going to do with the rest of my life?” However, instead of letting fear and worry win out, think to yourself, “It is incredibly exciting that I have so many possibilities ahead of me!”Think of all the experiences your life has in store for you: marriage (if you aren’t already), children, grandchildren, embarking on a new career, vacations, and making a difference in someone else’s life.

Keep up with your nutrition.,
Create a new exercise routine.,
Create new rituals.,
Consider teaching or coaching.,
Explore new career options.,
Get assistance from a career transition program.",How to Cope with the End of a Dance or Sports Career3," Maintaining a balanced diet can be particularly important after an athletic or dance career. Your profession likely demanded a strict diet to help you stay in shape. You should keep eating healthy to keep your body and mind fit.If you need help tailoring the best diet, use an app or resource to create a personalized meal plan, like the US Department of Agriculture's Super Tracker: https://www.supertracker.usda.gov/.
Anxiety, along with other moods like sadness, can be physically demanding, so taking in enough nutrients is important for both your body and your mind.

, Practice and rehearsal most likely occupied lots of your time and accounted for your daily exercise. You should create a new exercise routine to stay occupied and active. Exercise a half hour a day or more, especially if the activity helps you keep a positive state of mind.Go for jogs and brisk walks, ride your bike, or go to the gym. Try mixing things up by starting a new exercise. For instance, if you never swam much before, start swimming laps every morning.
If it is enjoyable for you to continue the exercise you used to do for your career, then you could try doing something similar, such as taking Zumba classes or salsa lessons if you were a dancer. However, if it is too painful for you right now, then it is okay to do something totally different.

, In addition to healthy routines, sports and performance typically involve rituals that feel sacred. Without those rituals, it might feel impossible to maintain a sense of order. Find ways of creating new rituals to help restore your senses of meaning and balance in life.Think of any cultural or religious traditions you were raised in, and explore ways of incorporating your tradition’s rituals into your life. You could go to a religious service every week, meditate daily, recite a poem or prayer at a certain time every day, or simply keep a daily journal.

, Teaching or coaching can help you stay engaged with the sport or art that you love, and could even be a new career option. Simply volunteering to coach a children's dance or sport team can have a positive impact on your feelings of self-worth. Knowing that others value you and look up to you will boost you confidence., Look for a job that's related to your former dance or sports career. Try to find a new occupation that will help you put your skills to use.You can also talk to other professionals who retired before you to find out what kinds of careers they pursued after retiring.
In addition to teaching or coaching, you could consider options like: personal trainer or fitness instructor, sports or dance journalist, personal assistant, or open your own gym or studio. You could even go back for a psychology degree or counseling certification and help others get through the struggle of ending a sports or dance career.

, A career transition program can offer career counseling, help you put together a resume and cover letter, help you access healthcare, and help you access emergency financial assistance. Availability and types of services offered varies by location.If you live in the United States, find a nearby regional program on Athlete Career Transition website (http://actpathway.com/) or the career transitions for dancers section on the Actors Fund’s website (http://www.actorsfund.org/services-and-programs/career-transition-dancers).
For locations outside of the US, search your national government’s website to check for state-funded programs. Do an online search for “career transition programs” or “career counseling” for dancers or athletes near your location.

Locate your local unemployment office.,
Learn the requirements to determine if you qualify to collect unemployment benefits.,
Make sure your past earnings meet the requirements.,
Make sure your reasons for leaving qualify you for unemployment benefits.,
Make sure you are available and willing to work.,
Fill out the required application for the state unemployment insurance.,
Complete an interview in person or by phone.,
Appeal a denial of benefits, if necessary.,
Collect unemployment benefits.,
Continue to file for unemployment weekly or biweekly, depending on your state's rules, until you secure a job or your unemployment benefit runs out.",How to Collect Unemployment," Depending on the size of your state, there may be a single central office or several regional offices.


Often, you can find the ""unemployment insurance office"" for your state online. Although you might be able to file a claim online, certain parts of the application process might need to be completed in person, depending on the state.;
, There are certain circumstances under which you may not qualify, including if you did not make the minimum required earnings or if you are a self-employed contractor to a corporation. However, most people who have been laid off and who are in the work force for at least six months will qualify to collect unemployment benefits.

, States usually require you to have earned a certain amount during a one-year base period to qualify. The base period is usually the earliest four of the five complete calendar quarters before you filed your claim. For example, for a claim filed in December 2012, the base period would be July 2011 through June 2012.


Depending on the state, you usually need to meet one of two stipulation. California, for example, requires that you either:
Demonstrate to have earned at least $1,300 in your highest paid quarter during the base period; or
Demonstrate to have earned at least $900 in your highest paid quarter during the base period as well as at least 1.25 times your earnings in the highest paid quarter during the entire base period.



, Most states will accept certain reasons for leaving your job as legitimate — firings, layoffs — while denying others — quitting. Some exceptions exist.



Layoffs. If you are laid off, are out of a job due to a reduction in workforce (RIF), or are downsized, you will qualify in all states for unemployment, unless you fail to meet a different requirement.

Firings. If you were fired because the company decided you weren't a good fit, or because your skills didn't match the expectations of the former employer, you should be able to collect benefits. If you are fired because of serious and systematic misconduct — you intentionally neglected your duties, which harmed the former employer's business interests — there's less of a chance you'll get unemployment.

Quitting. If you quit because you didn't like your job or it was stressing you out, you probably won't get unemployment benefits. If you quit because of unsafe or unfair workplace conditions (harassment, discrimination, fraud), alerted your supervisor, and left enough time for the employer to fix the situation, you should qualify. If you quit because of health or family concerns (you are a victim of domestic violence, your spouse is relocating, etc.) you should qualify as well.

, The state may ask for records verifying your job search as well as for the results of your search. In order to collect unemployment, you must be actively looking for work, and if given a reasonable offer of employment, accept it. Exceptions to this rule often include:


The job does not fit with your prior experience or career trajectory.
The job forces you to join a labor union.
The job is unusually dangerous.
The wages offered are substantially below the norm for that job.
The job would offend your religious or spiritual sensibilities.

, There will be questions such as, ""When were you laid off?"" ""Are available for work?"" and ""Are you currently actively looking for work?"" Standard information such as your name, date of birth, address and social security number is also be required.

, To cut down on unemployment insurance fraud, many states require that people be interviewed over the phone or in person before benefits can begin. Benefits will usually be paid retro-actively to the date of termination. Be sure to have copies of your pay stubs, your most recent tax return, you birth certificate, and your Social Security number in case verification is needed.


What can you expect in your phone interview? It's a simple, fact-finding interview. You'll be asked questions about your previous employment, along with basic questions about your application.

, If you are denied for unemployment benefits, you may file an appeal to be reconsidered. You must file the appeal within 20 days of the denial.""Once the unemployment department receives the appeal, it will schedule a hearing before an impartial administrative law judge and mail you the results of the hearing.

, The amount you earned while you were employed will determine your unemployment benefit. You will begin to receive a check from the state each week for a period of 26 weeks, possibly longer depending on whether there are extenuating prevailing economic conditions that prompt the state and federal government to extend benefits to some recipients.


Every time you file a benefit, you must state any earnings from any job you receive, not when you are paid, but when you earn them. If your gross earnings exceed 25% of your weekly benefit amount (WBA), you could see a reduction in your WBA., The subsequent application will be much shorter than the initial one. It will essentially ask if you procured work, and if so, how much money you made.

For a definitive answer, research your state's rules.,
Know the information you'll need to calculate your weekly payments.,
Determine your wages during each quarter of your base period.,
Determine your highest-earning quarter.,
Find your weekly payment by following the unique procedure for your state.,
Be prepared for your actual weekly benefit to be subject to deductions.,
Expect not to receive less than your state's minimum benefit amount or more than its maximum.,
Calculate your maximum benefit amount as a multiple of your weekly benefit amount.,
Know what to expect in terms of payment frequency and size.,
Know that unemployment benefits are subject to certain rules and limitations.,
Know that different states will have different unemployment requirements.",How to Calculate Unemployment," Every state has its own unemployment program run in conjunction with the federal government. The rules for calculating unemployment benefits and the requirements for claiming benefits will vary depending on the laws of the state you live in. Thus, the steps in this section may not hold true for all states. When in doubt, consult the website of your state's employment agency for information that's pertinent to you.


For the purposes of this article, we'll calculate sample unemployment payments based on the rules for California and Texas, the two most populous states. This will demonstrate some of the subtle differences that can exist between different states when it comes to unemployment benefits.;
, As noted above, your WBA is calculated as a percentage of the income you were receiving before you lost your job. Typically, the income you'll use to calculate this is based on what you earned during the first four of the previous five business quarters. This is called your ""base period"". To calculate your WBA, you'll need to know how much you worked (in terms of hours) and what you made during each quarter of this base period. If you've kept your old paystubs, these can be indispensable here. Otherwise, you may need to contact your old employer(s) for information.


The calendar year is divided into four quarters, each of which contains three months. The four quarters are Jan.-Mar. (Q1), Apr.-Jun. (Q2), Jul.-Sep. (Q3), and Oct.-Dec. (Q4). Usually, the income level you'll use to calculate your MBA is based on what you earned during the first four of the previous five business quarters.

For example, if you're filing for unemployment in April (Quarter 2), you'll use your income from Q4, Q3, Q2, and Q1 of last year. You wouldn't use your income from Q1 of this year.



, Use paystubs, W2 forms, and/or records from your former employers to determine the amount of money you made in each of the business quarters of your base period. Your eventual weekly benefit is determined based on your quarterly income during this period. As a reminder, your base period is comprised of the four quarters before the most recent quarter in the past.


For example purposes, we'll calculate unemployment payments for a hypothetical worker in both California and Texas. Let's say that this worker is applying for benefits in October. October is in Q4, so we'll use our wages from Q2 and Q1 of this year and from Q4 and Q3 of this year. Let's say, for our purposes, that our worker earned $7,000 in every quarter except Q2, in which he earned $8,000.
Note that some states allow you to count your wages during an alternate base period if you don't have enough wages in the normal base period to apply for benefits. Depending on the state, extenuating circumstances may need to apply - for instance, in Texas, you can only do this in the case of a debilitating illness, whereas in California, there is no such restriction., It's not unusual for employees to earn more during some quarters than in others, especially if their job was one that paid by the hour. Usually, depending on your state, your unemployment benefits will be calculated based on your wages during either your single highest-paying quarter or from the average of your wages during your highest-earning quarter and another quarter or quarter(s). In any case, you'll usually need to determine your highest-earning quarter to accurately estimate your benefits.


In both California and Texas, your unemployment benefit is based on your wages during the single highest-earning quarter in your base period.However, this isn't the case in every state. For instance, in Washington State, an average of your wages during the two highest-earning quarters in your base period is used., Every state has its own way of calculating the size of benefit recipient's weekly payments. Usually, however, the process is as simple as multiplying your wages during your highest-earning quarter (or an average of your quarters' wages - see above) by a certain percentage, dividing your wages by a certain number, or by simply consulting a table. The end goal is the same in every state - to award you some fraction of the earnings you were ""used to"" in the form of regular benefits. The amount of money you receive in benefits is always less than the amount you made from working. Consult your state unemployment agency's site for precise instructions for your state.


In Texas, weekly benefits are calculated by dividing the wages from the highest-earning quarter in your base period by 25 and rounding to the nearest dollar. In other words, you receive 1/25 of your quarterly wages per week (whereas by working at the level of your highest-earning quarter, you would receive about 1/12 of your quarterly wages per week - a little more than twice as much). In the case of our hypothetical worker, 8,000/25 = $320. This worker would receive $320 per week.
In California, the process is slightly different. Unemployment benefits are found by matching your wages during your highest-earning quarter to preset values in a table provided by the Employment Development Division.In this case, based on $8,000 earned during our highest-earning quarter, our worker would claim $308 in benefits. Note that this is about 1/26 of his quarterly earnings.

, Take your weekly benefit amount as a maximum possible value, rather than a concrete representation of how much you'll actually receive. In reality, there are various reasons why you may not be able to ""keep"" all of the money you'll receive in weekly benefits. For example:


Unemployment payments are considered part of a person's taxable income and thus can have tax withheld.Unemployment payments can be garnished to pay child support, outstanding debts, etc.
Certain types of work may be subject to unique rules when it comes to unemployment benefits. For instance, in California, if a school employee files a claim between terms but has a reasonable assurance of returning to work the next term, benefits may be withheld. However, if she is eventually denied from returning to work, these ""back payments"" may be made retroactively., Different states have different ""ranges"" for their weekly benefit amounts - basically, the state won't pay more or less than certain set amounts per week. If your calculated unemployment benefit is less than your state's minimum amount, expect to receive the minimum amount and vice versa if you calculated a benefit greater than its maximum.


For example, in California, the maximum weekly benefit is $450. If our worker was fabulously wealthy and made $800,000 during his highest-earning quarter, rather than $8,000, he would still only collect $450 dollars per week, not 800,000/25 = $32,000.
In Texas, the maximum weekly benefit is $454, so our worker would receive, at most, this.

, No state will give weekly unemployment benefits indefinitely. Usually, unemployment benefits ""cap"" after a certain dollar amount has been paid out. After this point, to continue receiving benefits, the out-of-work person usually must re-apply or file for an extension. Usually, your maximum benefit amount is either your weekly benefit amount times a certain predetermined number or some percentage of your base period wages.


In Texas, a recipient's maximum benefit amount is 26 times the weekly benefit amount or 27% of all wages earned during the base period - whichever is smaller. Our hypothetical worker's weekly payment is $320 - 320 × 26 = $8320. His total base period wages are $29,000. 29,000 × 0.27 = $7,830. The latter is smaller, so we can say that his maximum benefit amount is $7,830.
In California, a recipient's maximum benefit amount is 26 times the weekly benefit amount or half of all wages earned during the base period - whichever is smaller. Our hypothetical worker's weekly payment is $308 - 308 × 26 = $8008. His total base period wages are $29,000. 29,000/2 = $14,500. The former is smaller, so we can say that his maximum benefit amount is $8,008.

, Usually, a person receiving unemployment benefits receives payments each week, rather than every two weeks or every month, like most paychecks. The size of each weekly payment is usually called the Weekly Benefit Amount or Weekly Benefit Rate (WBA or WBR). The WBA for a given unemployment claim varies based on the size of the recipient's previous income - the more you used to make, the more you'll receive in unemployment benefits. Though the only way to be absolutely sure how much you'll receive in unemployment benefits each week is to actually file a claim, typically, you can expect to make about 40-60% of your previous income (depending on where you live).

, To prevent fraud and misuse of benefits, state governments usually require benefit recipients to look for full-time work as a condition of receiving benefits. Occasionally, benefit recipients may be asked to provide proof that they are doing so by submitting a current resume, records of correspondence with potential employers, job applications, etc. Recipients may also need to attend meetings or employment workshops.


Additionally, the amount of unemployment benefits one person receives isn't unlimited. Your Maximum Benefits Payable or Maximum Benefit Amount (MBP or MBA) is the total amount the state will pay you in unemployment benefits during the term of your claim (often one year). When you've received this amount, you may need to re-apply and/or undergo an eligibility interview to continue receiving benefits. MBP varies from state to state.

, To receive unemployment payments, you'll usually have to meet certain eligibility requirements. The unemployment agency usually verifies that you're eligible by contacting both you and your employer, so don't lie about your eligibility. To be eligible, you'll need to have lost your job for reasons beyond your control - for instance, you can't have been fired for incompetence or quit your job because you didn't like it and file an unemployment claim. A few other common requirements that you may need to contend with, depending on your state, are:


You must have earned more than a certain amount during your base period. Usually, this is a fairly small amount - even with a minimum wage job, if you've worked for most or all of your base period, you should be fine. This is to prevent people who worked only very little during their base period to claim benefits.
Your hypothetical weekly benefit must be more than a certain fraction of your total earnings during part or all of your base period. As above, this is to prevent people who worked very little from claiming benefits.
You must have worked a certain amount of days or hours during your base period. See above.

Understand that severance is not required.,
Learn about a waiver and release.,
Identify the parts of a severance package.,
Research if severance is common in your industry.,
Read your employment contract.,
Ask if sick time and vacation time can be “cashed out.” You may not have an automatic right to “cash out” the value of any accrued sick time, vacation days, or personal time.,
Negotiate for severance pay.",How to Calculate Severance Pay," Severance is generally not required by law.However, an employer could agree to include it as part of an employment contract. Alternately, the employer could offer severance at termination even if it was not included in the employment contract. Severance may be paid as a lump sum or in installments.


Severance pay also is not “unemployment insurance.” Unemployment benefits are cash payments based on a percentage of your earnings. Each state sets a maximum amount.The insurance is paid for by your employer.
For tips on calculating your unemployment benefit, see Calculate Unemployment.;
, Some employers will offer severance to employees in order to limit their exposure to potential lawsuits. While offering severance pay is not itself evidence of an employer’s wrongdoing, some employers will nevertheless offer severance pay if they suspect an employee may sue the company. In order to get the severance pay, the employee must sign a waiver of all legal claims.


These waivers release the employer from legal liability and are valid so long as the employee signed it voluntarily and knowingly.Although you cannot be prevented from reporting discrimination to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, you can be prevented from bringing a private lawsuit., A severance package can include much more than just a payment of money. Severance packages can also include:Health and wellness benefits
Positive letters of recommendation
Uncontested unemployment compensation
Moving expenses
Ability to keep cell phone, computer, etc.

, If you are negotiating an employment contract, then you might want to know if severance is commonly included in employment contracts in your industry. Try to find examples of employment contracts or speak to an attorney who practices employment law and who specializes in your particular industry.


To find an attorney, visit your state’s bar association, which should run a referral program. You can find your state or local bar association by visiting this map, hosted by the American Bar Association.

, If you have been laid off, then you should look at your employment contract to see if you are eligible for severance. If so, the contract should state how severance is calculated.


Severance is most often calculated according to the length you have been with the company. For example, it is common for hourly-wage employees to be offered one week’s pay for each year that they have been with the company.If you have worked for a company for five years, then you would get five weeks of pay at your current pay rate.


Salaried employees sometimes are offered at least two weeks’ pay for each year that they have been at the company.Accordingly, you would divide your yearly salary by 52 to get the weekly pay rate. Then, multiply this pay rate by the number of weeks. If you earn $39,000 a year, then you make $750 a week. If you worked for the company for 10 years, then you would get $7,500 in severance.



, In fact, few state laws require an employer to do so.You should read your employment contract to see what rules govern cashing out this time. If you can’t find any rule, then ask your employer if you will be paid for this time.

, If your contract does not have any clause pertaining to severance, then you can try to negotiate for it. You should think over any initial deal offered by your employer without immediately accepting it. If you are over 40, then federal law allows you 21 days to consider a severance package.To counteroffer, you should come up with a reason why you need more money. Career coaches advise that you can mention the fact that you just bought a new house or have other recent, large expenses.An employer may be sufficiently motivated to get you to sign a waiver and release that they will increase the amount of severance just to get you to sign.
If you have an illness in the family, then ask for extended health benefits. You could get an additional six months before having to go on COBRA."

Keep in mind that there are different types of perfectionists.,
Avoid giving projects that are too large in scope.,
Appeal to their sense of empathy and vanity.,
Appeal to their self-interest.",How to Deal With a Perfectionist at Work1," Perfectionists tend to notice details and they have high standards, so you may be tempted to place them in a management role.However, in some cases, this might not work out because of the different forms that perfectionism can take. Some of the different types of perfectionism include:Neurotic Perfectionism. These types of perfectionists crave the approval of others and they may worry incessantly that they will not get it. For example, a neurotic perfectionist might spend hours on a relatively unimportant email to his or her boss and agonize over every word and phrase.

Narcissistic Perfectionism. These types of perfectionists rely on the opinions of others for their sense of superiority. They are also fond of rules and order. For example, someone who is a narcissistic perfectionist might show off her knowledge of a procedure or rule to gain the approval of her coworkers or superiors.

Principled Perfectionism. These perfectionists are driven by morality and ethics. They might even try to impose their morality and ethics on other people in the workplace. For example, a principled perfectionist who is opposed to eating meat might shame other coworkers for what they are eating during lunchtime.

Hyper-Attentive Perfectionism. These perfectionists focus in on minor details to an unreasonable degree, and they may be bothered by external stimuli. For example, a hyper-attentive perfectionist might become unreasonably upset if a coworker asks her a question while she is composing an email and breaks her focus.;
, Many perfectionists are hard workers, which are admirable qualities for an employee to possess. However, some perfectionists have a tendency to hone in on small components of a project rather than looking at the big picture.Therefore, it might be helpful to select tasks carefully for these types of employees.


Give them tasks that are detail oriented and limited in scope, so they don't get a large project bogged down by too many details. Some perfectionists may not be willing to delegate to others, so it's best to let them work independently on projects that require a unified vision to be successful.

, If your employee is a neurotic or narcissistic perfectionist, then he or she will have a strong drive to please others. Therefore, explaining how their work style is affecting the team's overall performance may be an effective way to motivate the person.Phrase it in terms that show that you realize they have high standards, and that you appreciate those high standards.


For example, you might say something like, ""You've got high standards, just like me, and that's what this organization needs. Just remember, good morale is critical to good production. A good rule of thumb is to give two compliments for every criticism.""

, Some perfectionists are quite ambitious and may even desire to be perfect, which is either due to internal motivation or external motivation.If the person is treating other people in the workplace poorly, then you might explain to the person that managers who demoralize their subordinates struggle to advance in the workplace.The higher a person advances in the corporate hierarchy, the more they have to compromise in order for the good of the whole.


Try saying something like this: ""You are always trying to make sure that all the details are attended to, and that every little thing is done exactly right. That's fantastic, because people have to get the little things right before they can get the big things right. You're well on your way to big things. Just remember, upper management is all about the big picture. The big picture is understanding that focusing on improving from 95% success to 100% success usually bogs you down. The tunnel vision costs you more than it does to simply move on to the next project.""

Pick your battles.,
Ask what they want you to do differently.,
Stick to your guns.,
Keep your distance.",How to Deal With a Perfectionist at Work2," It is important to decide when you should take a stand and when you should let something go. This can be difficult, but taking a moment to consider how important the issue is may help you to decide when to take a stand or not.


The idea here is to keep perspective. Since this is a co-worker and not a boss, agreeing with them doesn't necessarily mean that you actually have to follow their suggestions. Although it might seem overly passive, just saying ""yes"" and moving on with your life can diminish conflict between you and your colleague and diminish stress on your part.Remember that agreeing with the person doesn't give them power over you. In fact, it does the opposite, because it frees you from focusing on the person’s demands.

, Sometimes a perfectionist may hide their insecurities by using criticism.This can be upsetting, but it might help to remind yourself that this is a defense mechanism. The person may just be lashing out at you because he or she feels insecure about something.


By asking your colleague about how they would prefer something to be done, you can disarm those insecurities. Try signaling to them that you are a person who cares about their feelings.When they understand that you value their feelings, it makes them feel more secure, which makes them less likely to criticize you in the future.
For example, you might say something like, “It seems like you are upset about the outcome of this project. Do you want to talk about it?”

, If the issue is important to you, then you are right to stick to your guns. It is unlikely that your supervisors and co-workers are unaware of your colleague's perfectionist tendencies. If something is important to you and you disagree, you have a right to say so.


Disagreeing doesn't mean arguing. State your disagreement and move on.The disagreement doesn't have to define the relationship if you don't let it. Try saying something like, ""I respect what you’re saying, I think we are just coming at it from different perspectives.""
If they seem intent on having an argument with you, then walk away. It's unlikely your colleagues and supervisors are unaware of your co-worker's ways. Therefore, it's unlikely you will get blamed for not wanting to get drawn into an argument with them.

, This simplest way to avoid conflict is sometimes to avoid the person you conflict with. When you do have to work together, remind them that everybody has their own job, and that you have to do yours to the boss' satisfaction, and not theirs.


You can always disengage. If your odious co-worker is going on about an inconsequential detail, just remain noncommittal.
Start off with ""ok,"" ""I see,"" or the old standby, ""huh.""
Then make your escape--""I didn't know you felt that way. So interesting. One of these days, we're going to have to do lunch and you can tell me all about it. Gotta go.""

Manage your manager.,
Push the information their way.,
Make peace with the fact that there is only so much you can do.,
Seek mentoring and support in other places.,
Jump ship if and when you have to.",How to Deal With a Perfectionist at Work3," This is a technique called ""managing up."" The idea is to identify your bosses personality quirks, strengths, and weaknesses, and tailor your communication style to theirs.Perfectionists desire to be in control. This might seem self-evident, but the proper response isn't. If you have a boss who is a control freak, use it to your advantage. When they give you a task, ask direct, detailed questions that define the limits of the assignment.Ask about your manager’s expectations. This may give your manager an enhanced feeling of control, but it also protects you from an arbitrary response on their part. Although perfectionism might be inherently unreasonable, people--even perfectionist people--try not to be. If they have given you a starting point, an endpoint, and the boundaries of a task, if you complete it according to their specifications it lessens the likelihood that they will be angry with you., Once you've got a good handle on what they're looking for, don't wait for them to ask you for it, or ""pull it out"" of you. Push it their way.


The more you give them the information they’re looking for without asking, the less likely they are to think about you and your imperfections. It allows you to avoid conflict by being in the right place at the right time, which in this case, is out of sight and out of mind.

, In the limited relationship that you have as a subordinate, it is very unlikely that you are going to change your boss' fundamental personality profile.They may always be critical, and they may always be overly critical.


However, it might be possible to earn your boss’s respect. The bad news is that you may have to endure numerous tiresome interactions in the process. The good news is that other subordinates have probably earned the respect of your boss, your boss has probably recommended others for promotions, and your boss has probably given good employment references to former employees. There's no reason he or she can't do the same for you.

, Since perfectionists have unreasonably high standards, it will always be difficult to earn their praise. They make very poor mentors, so don't expect them to fill that role.We all need support and guidance, but if you seek it from your perfectionist boss, it will likely end up doing little but harming your self-image. Don't put yourself in the position to have your self-worth determined by someone who thinks everyone is unworthy.The perfectionist boss is a situation to deal with and get through. Do your best to make it as short as possible.

, Since the perfectionist boss is a situation to be dealt with and adapted to, and no accepted indefinitely, you have to know when to cut the cord.


If the boss is unlikely to leave his or her position, then once you've earned their respect enough to get a good recommendation, find a way to move. That might mean a transfer within the company, and it might mean finding a job outside of the company.

For example, rent and mortgage payments are essential and (usually) unchanging. However, you may be able to negotiate a lower payment on your car insurance - especially if you will no longer be driving to work on a daily basis.;

(And don't be embarrassed! Remember - you paid into this while you were working, so you're entitled to take it out now that you're not!)

, This may not be something you really want to do, and if you have enough money in your savings accounts and from severance pay, you may not have to do it. But it may be an option you'll have to face. Start now by talking with family members you get along with well. Ask them if they have a spare room where you could stay for a short period of time in order to economize on rent. Offer to help with household chores, such as babysitting or doing yard work.

, Perhaps you dreamed about this while you were working full-time. Now's your chance to see if you can really do this. Consider selling used books on Amazon or collectibles on eBay. Start with books and other items you already have around the house, to hone your selling skills. Even if it doesn't work out, chances are good you will bring in a little extra cash.

, For many people, long periods of unemployment can lead to despair and depression. Take care of yourself in whatever way you can. Reward yourself and your family for your economizing efforts at least once a week. Go out to a nice (not too expensive) restaurant, or visit a local park.

For example, instead of saying, ""You need to get your act together and work harder or we're going to miss our deadline,"" say, ""I'd like to talk to you about what we can do to get that project you're working on finished sooner."", It may be that your difficult coworker simply has a different style of communication than you do, which can make it difficult for the two of you to understand each other. Make sure to communicate to your coworker if you feel that there is something he needs to do to improve your working relationship. You also need to be willing to step in and do your part.Avoid accusing your coworker of anything. For example, instead of saying, ""You never give me enough time to prepare for presentations,"" say, ""I work best when I know about a presentation two days in advance. Can you try to let me know by then?""
Don't take offense if your coworker offers you some constructive criticism in return. Do your best to learn from it, assuming it is reasonable.

, If you have a coworker who is constantly bringing other people down with her negative attitude, let her know how you feel about it. Everyone has different ways of venting frustration, and she may not have any idea how her negative attitude affects you.If you don't want to confront her directly, try responding to your negative coworker with an abundance of positivity. She will most likely get the hint that you don't like her negative energy.

, In some circumstances, the best thing you can do is to tell a superior, such as a manager or your company's HR department, about your coworker's unacceptable behavior. The appropriateness of this option will depend upon the unique situation and your office culture. Make sure you take a minute to think about whether the situation is really worth reporting before you go running to your boss.Before reporting a coworker's behavior to your superiors, you should make sure that you are doing so because you believe the behavior is genuinely harmful to the company and/or employees, and not because you are feeling angry or want to get someone in trouble.
You should also ask yourself if the problem could be more easily resolved if you confronted your coworker about it directly. Keep in mind that if you go over his head, he will likely feel threatened.

, You have the right to feel safe and respected at work. If a coworker's behavior is simply unprofessional, make sure he knows that you won't stand for it. You can try telling him that you will report his behavior to your manager or to HR if it happens again, but if you say this, you have to follow through.It's important not to let the bully see that his actions are affecting you the way he wants them to. Be strong and don't react emotionally., It's a good idea to keep a record of your coworker's bad behavior, just in case it gets to the point that you feel you need to report it.Keep hard evidence like emails or voicemails if you can. If you don't have anything like that, simply keep a log of your coworker's bad behavior.

, Everyone gets upset for different reasons, and it is important to keep in mind that just because a coworker upset you, does not mean that it was her intention to do so. Try to take a deep breath and let go of the conflict if possible.If you still feel personally insulted by something your coworker did or said to you, even after you've had some time to think about it, try explaining how you feel.

, You don't want your other coworkers or your boss to think you are whiny or a troublemaker, so don't go running to others with every little problem. Before you report something, make sure you can't handle the issue on your own.Even if you have a perfectly valid reason to complain, keep in mind that your negativity can be contagious and bring your coworkers down. Try to be a source of positive energy in the office., It may be tempting to spread gossip about the coworker you don't like, but it is always best not to get involved. If another coworker is spreading gossip, just walk away or tell him that you're not interested in hearing about it.Avoid talking about anything that is not directly related to work with coworkers who are known gossipers., You may be able to get jealous or overly competitive coworkers to work with you if you just acknowledge the role they play on your team. Treat everyone with respect, praise the achievements of the whole team, and show them all that you value their input., If your coworker is the type to get overly stressed out and overreact about everything, respond to him calmly and rationally. Don't let the stress wear off on you.

, Instead of trying to argue with a coworker who doesn't want to hear your opinion, try acknowledging his point of view and asking him to explain his ideas further. This might make him more open to having a dialogue with you., If everyone in your department knows exactly who is responsible for doing what, then you won't have to worry about a coworker who isn't pulling her weight or refuses to take responsibility for her actions. Try to encourage clear communication with your whole team., You don't want to end up saying something you regret in the heat of the moment, so if your coworker has said something that really upsets you, always take a moment to cool down before responding.Keep in mind that if your coworker is purposefully upsetting you, he wants you to lose your cool, so don't give in.

Consider sending notes or cards periodically.",How to Cope With a Grieving Colleague," Before you talk to your colleague, it's a good idea to check in on your own emotions. You want to show support without detracting from your colleague's grief, which can be difficult if you're not in the right state of mind.Make sure you're not smiling or chipper when you talk to your colleague. The last thing you want to do is offer condolences immediately after hearing a funny joke.
Don't try to make it about you. Avoid saying anything like ""I know how you feel"" or ""I went through the same thing."";
, How you interact with your colleague will vary, depending on the nature of your existing relationship. You should console that coworker regardless of your relationship (or lack thereof) as a common courtesy, but if it's someone you know well you'll be expected to offer extra support.If you don't know your coworker very well, keep it professional.
If you know that coworker fairly well, you may want to offer a hug or a comforting pat on the back. If you're comfortable doing so (and if you think your coworker would be comfortable with this), then you can, but you don't have to.

, It's very important that you be mindful of what you say to your colleague. Some people who mean well try to console another person and end up insulting them or dismissing their feelings. Be cautious and choose your words carefully to avoid any awkward missteps as you comfort your coworker.Never give prescriptive advice (""You should"" or ""You ought to""), as this may come across as insulting and condescending.
Don't tell your coworker how to feel or whether they should show or share emotions. Let your coworker decide for himself or herself what is appropriate behavior.
Do not offer any type of cliche, such as ""It's for the best"" or ""God has a plan."" You may mean well, but saying something like this fails to acknowledge the loss your coworker is suffering through., Your colleague needs all the support they can get. When you talk to your colleague and offer your condolences, be sincere and stay mindful that they are going through a difficult period.Be brief but sincere in your condolences. Say something like, ""I'm so sorry for your loss.""
You may want to add an offer to assist that coworker. For example, you might say something like, ""Please let me know if there's anything I can do to help.""
You may be able to offer additional support by talking about a shared memory.If your coworker told you stories about the deceased, you can say something like, ""I remember the story you told me about that time _____. He (or she) was a good person; I'm so sorry.""

, Some people feel compelled to talk through the grieving process, while others may be more private and withdrawn. There is no right or wrong way of grieving, but it's important to be aware of what your coworker needs.Don't pry or snoop into your coworker's affairs. You can politely and respectfully offer support by saying something like, ""I just want you to know that I'm always here if you need someone to talk to.""
If your coworker decides to talk to you, be willing to listen and give that individual your undivided attention. If they don't want to talk about their loss, then don't ask questions.

, If your colleague is in deep distress, they may have a hard time talking to others all day about their loss. If you think your colleague may be dreading having to explain their sadness or prolonged absence all day, you can offer to let others know so that your colleague doesn't have to.Always ask permission before telling anyone. Remember that it's not your business, and your coworker may be selective about who knows that someone has died.
If your colleague accepts your offer, inform your colleagues in a tactful and respectful manner. Take individuals aside in the workplace and tell them quietly that your colleague has suffered a loss and could use their support.

, In addition to saying that you're there to help out in any way you can, it might be a kind gesture to help your colleague out with some tasks at work. If your colleague has been absent from work for a while there may be a lot of piled up assignments, so see if it's okay for you to help manage some of those tasks until your colleague is back on their feet.Recognize that your coworker may simply want space. Everyone grieves in different ways, so it may be best to simply ask your coworker what you can do to help.

, Some companies allow employees to donate their leave time to other employees. Depending on where you work, your colleague may have only gotten one to two weeks to mourn, or perhaps no time at all. Much of their time off was probably spent making funeral arrangements, so your colleague may not have even had time to process their loss. If you're able to, donating some of your vacation time or sick days to that colleague would be a big help in case they feel emotionally unready for work.Talk to someone in human resources about whether your company allows workers to donate unused leave time to another worker.
If your company allows it and you'd like to donate some of your time, talk to your other coworkers to see if anyone else would be willing to donate some of their time to your grieving colleague.

, It's often considered a sign of respect and support to attend the service of a colleague's close friend or relative. However, not everyone is comfortable attending a stranger's service. Your colleague may also want some privacy for the burial service, as it may be seen as a time and place reserved for family and close friends.Ask your colleague when the service is, and ask if it would be okay for you to attend.
If you go, remember to be professional and supportive. Wear black dress clothes, try to avoid bringing young children, and let your colleague chat with their family and friends before you approach to offer additional condolences.

, Some families decide to open a memorial fund instead of accepting flowers for the deceased. If your colleague's family has requested donations, try to donate some money to help offset the costs of the service.Ask a few other coworkers to chip in some money. If you send a card with your donations, make sure your colleague knows that the donations came from multiple coworkers and not just you.

, It's one thing to offer vague, generalized assistance by saying something like, ""Let me know if there's anything you need."" It's another thing to offer specific, concrete assistance. Your colleague may not be comfortable asking for help, so offering something concrete would probably be greatly appreciated.Be specific in what you offer and when you're available. For example, you might say, ""Can I bring a meal for your family on Tuesday?""
Let your colleague know that you and your coworkers want to be helpful and supportive during this hardship, both at work and outside of work.

, It can take months or even years to finish grieving a death, and many people feel alone as they go through this process. Sending intermittent cards to let your coworker know that you're thinking of them can be a great comfort as the grieving process goes on. Many coworkers will have forgotten about the death after a few weeks, but sending a card a month or two after the service is a nice way to show that you remember and are thinking of that person.Make sure the cards you send are appropriate. Don't send anything happy or funny; keep the card's tone somber and supportive.
You don't have to write much when you sign the card. You can simply write, ""Thinking of you and hoping you and your family are well. I'm here if you need anything.""
Don't send cards indefinitely, as you don't want to be a constant reminder of your colleague's loss. Cut yourself off from sending cards after two or three months at most.

"
Examine your motivation.,
Decide what outcome you would like to see.,
Choose the right time and the right place when approaching a colleague with criticisms.",How to Criticize a Colleague's Work1," Only provide feedback if you are truly trying to help your coworker and improve your work product. If you are criticizing because you do not like the person, are frustrated, or are stressed, keep your criticisms to yourself. If you are not criticizing someone for the right reasons, try talking to a friend or family member so you can vent.Feedback should only be given for a specific purpose not just for the sake of doing it.;
, Once you identify a specific issue, think about the changes that need to be made and what can be done to achieve them. You are much more likely to see changes if you have a proposed outcome. The criticism you give should be a learning experience for your coworker.


If the issue was a late report, you may think of ways to increase efficiency such as setting small milestones and breaking down the project into multiple reports. This is much more helpful than saying your report was late, you need to work faster.

, You don't want to confront a work colleague in front of others, so pick somewhere private. Additionally, you don't want to criticize him if he is having a bad day already. He may be in defensive mode, in which case he will not be open to any form of suggestion, especially a criticism.


If the person is about to finish a project or is preparing for a presentation, wait until they are finished before you criticize their work. Your feedback is not helpful at this time and will not change the outcome of the work."
"
Focus on the task.,
Use the sandwich method.,
Be specific about your concerns.,
Watch your tone.,
Offer suggestions on how to improve your colleague's work.,
Allow your coworker to speak.",How to Criticize a Colleague's Work2," Criticism should be about the situation and not your personal feelings about your coworker or the person’s character. If you are dealing with a coworker that you are not too fond of, think of how you would address the situation with a different coworker. Using a passive voice instead of an active voice can help you focus on the situation instead of the person as well.For example, you would say, “The project had a lot of typos and errors. It seems like it was completed in a rush,” instead of “You are unorganized and careless.”
Avoid starting any criticism with “You did/didn’t” or “You are.”

, In this method, you place the criticism in between positive feedback. This will help your coworker be more receptive to the criticism. This is also called the Positive-Improvement-Positive (PIP) method.Start with a strength. If you are discussing a specific piece of work, talk about what was good about the work.
Discuss the things that you did not like and the areas that need improvement.
End the conversation by reiterating the strengths you mentioned and the positive outcomes that will happen if your coworker makes the suggested changes.
You may say, ""The paper had clear writing and a lot of good content, but it could benefit from some reorganization. If you make the organizational changes, the paper will be even stronger. You will turn a good paper into a great paper.""

, A specific concern is much easier to address than a general statement. Being specific also forces you to focus on the issue at hand and not bring up complaints that you have been thinking about for a long time. General statements may also make your colleague feel that you are nitpicking without reason.For example, if your coworker is always late, talk to your coworker about a specific time they were late instead of simply saying, “You’re always late.” You may say, ""I noticed that you were late to our team meeting this morning, is everything okay?""
A specific example of a problem will also prevent your coworker from denying the behavior that you are criticizing.

, Try to be as polite and friendly as possible. Even if what you are saying is true, the wrong tone can make the conversation go badly. Avoid being sarcastic, condescending, angry, or aggressive. Remain calm when discussing your issues with your colleague. The last thing you want is to have a heated discussion that will more likely make you both defensive. Angry discussions will close all avenues of future dialogue and make the work place a negative environment.Instead of sarcastically criticizing a presentation by saying, ""Isn't it terrible when someone can't speak clearly and get their point across?"" You may say, ""I get nervous when I have to present and mumble sometimes. Does this ever happen to you?""
The wrong tone will cause the colleague to become defensive and resentful, and the outcome of your discussion will be negative.
If you are experiencing some negative emotions, smile before you have the conversation. It is easier to be positive when you smile.

, This way your colleague will see that you are trying to help and that you are not just on a rampage to tear their work apart.Additionally, your coworker will recognize that your interests are in making sure that he succeeds also and that you are all working together for a positive outcome.


You can also say, “Everyone makes mistake,” or “I understand the choice you made.” Even if you have not made the same mistake, this will keep your coworker from feeling as upset and becoming unmotivated.Your coworker needs to know that you understand them and are on their side.
You may say, ""I completely understand why you turned in that assignment late. I get overwhelmed at times and it's hard to prioritize. Next time let me know that you're super busy. We can figure something out together.""

, Listen to your coworker’s explanation and point of view. Also ask your coworker what they could have done differently and what do they need to correct their work in the future. This turns criticism into a collaborative project. Your coworker may also be more receptive to the criticism if they are included in the problem solving process.


Be open to any feedback that your coworker provides. You may learn something.

"
"
Do not overload your coworker with feedback.,
Give your coworker time to change.,
Do not make assumptions about your coworker.",How to Criticize a Colleague's Work3," Focus on two or three specific points. Covering too many topics will confuse your coworker and can be overwhelming. Too much criticism can also hurt morale and be discouraging.It easier to make changes when there are only a few points to address.

, Change does not happen overnight. Once you criticize your coworker, give them an opportunity to put the changes in place. Allow your coworker to work on similar projects where they can demonstrate what they have learned.Encourage your coworker when they tackle similar projects that they have received previous feedback on. This shows that you trust them and believe in them.

, Your coworker may have done badly on a presentation or turned something in late. Do not assume that you know the reasons for this behavior. If you make assumptions, you are less likely to be constructive and fair when you talk to your coworker.For example, if your coworker did poorly on a presentation, you may assume that they were nervous or did not know what they were doing. However, your coworker could be dealing with personal issues or did not have time to prepare because of other assigned projects.
Making assumptions may also cause you to suggest improvements that do not address the root problem.
Approach criticism with the facts only.

Eye people's trash.,
Use a ""contamination"" tactic.,
Make your food hot.,
Use a cheap camera.",How to Catch a Lunch Thief1," You can catch some thieves by checking people's trash. Of course, you can't go digging around in people's trash cans. That's much too obvious. However, you can go and chat with co-workers right after a lunch when food was stolen. Some people just throw the remains in their own trash, even if they took it.You may think that someone is too dumb to throw the trash away in their office. However, some people steal out of a sense of entitlement and have no problem throwing it away there, particularly if they're the boss.;
, No, you shouldn't contaminate the food with something that could cause sickness. Rather, when someone eats your food, send out an office email saying, ""To whoever ate my food: I just found out the peanut butter in it has been recalled, and it can make you sick. You should seek medical attention."" Once in a blue moon, the thief may confess just to find out what the ""contamination"" does.You can also leave a note instead.

, One way to catch a thief is to spice your food with something particularly hot, such as a ghost pepper. You should be able to tell who ate it, as that person will end up sweating and probably need lots of water. If you spike your food this way, make sure to keep an eye out around the office.Keep in mind, you could face some legal ramifications with this tactic, particularly if it harms the person in some way (such as they are allergic to peppers).

, One option is a nanny camera, as you can find those relatively cheap. Hide it in the kitchen, and leave it on video. The next time someone steals food, check the camera to see who did the stealing. Of course, you'll need to find a camera that can be plugged in, or you'll need to charge it.You'll need your boss's permission for this option. Keep in mind that it could be your boss who is stealing your food, so that could cause a problem.

"
"
Gather some like-minded colleagues or peers.,
Pay attention to who is eating what.,
Listen attentively.",How to Catch a Lunch Thief2," You're going to need more than one person to stage a stakeout, as you can't hang out in the lunchroom all the time. Therefore, talk to some of your friends at work, and make an agreement to ""cover"" the lunchroom, meaning that you stagger lunches so that one of you is in there at all during lunch., Once you've staked out the lunchroom, keep an eye on what's being eating by whom. If you notice someone is taking something that doesn't belong to them, you've caught the person who's stealing the food, or at least one of them. This step works best if food is labelled, so you can see who it belongs to., If only a few of you are in the office late at night, listen to hear who's going in the kitchen. Food is more likely to be stolen when fewer people are around. If you hear someone in the kitchen, go investigate. You don't have to confront the person, just see what they are eating. You may know who it belongs to. If it's not them, you have your thief."
"
Appeal to the person's better nature.,
Post rules on the fridge.,
Make sure to label your food.,
Bring ingredients rather than a meal.,
Pick a dark lunch bag or container.,
Skip individual pre-packaged items.,
Try to hide the food.",How to Catch a Lunch Thief3," You could send out an office memo talking about why that food is important due to dietary restrictions. In other words, if you can't eat that food, you won't be able to eat because you have a strict diet or food allergies and can't pick up food just anywhere.You could also leave a note on the fridge instead of sending an email.

, Ask your boss if you can post rules about office food on the fridge. For instance, one rule could be, ""Don't eat food that's not yours unless clearly marked."" Another rule could be ""Label all food with a name and a date."" Rules may deter a few people., While it won't stop someone from taking your food, it may cause some people to think twice if your food is labelled with your name. That way, it puts a face on the problem, and they have to think about stealing your food rather than just ""someone's"" food.However, labeling your food can backfire, depending on the reason the person is stealing. For example, if the person steals as a way to get retribution on someone they don't like, and you happen to be someone they don't like, labeling the food just tells them whose is whose.

, That is, if you want a sandwich, bring components rather than the assembled sandwich. Similarly, if you have a salad, bring it in parts rather than assembled. Most people will go for something already assembled over something that needs to be put together., Another option that will deter some people is picking a lunch bag that's opaque. That way, the person can't see what's inside. Most people will avoid digging through a bag they can't see in, but they will take an option they can see., Bags of chips or carrots, sodas, yogurts, and even frozen meals are more likely to be stolen then things you buy in bulk and package yourself. The reason is the pre-packaged items seem more convenient, so they're easier to grab., One way to keep your lunch is to hide it away. If it's out-of-sight, it's less likely to be stolen. You can try hiding it at the back of the fridge, for instance, behind other food. You can also simply keep it at your desk in a small cooler or insulated lunch bag, along with ice packs."
"
Confront the thief.,
Talk to your boss.,
Take it to human resources.",How to Catch a Lunch Thief4," One way you can deal with a lunch thief is to simply confront the thief. Confronting the thief can be as simple as entering the room and watching as they take your food. If they turn around and realize they're caught, that can stop a few thieves.However, you can also approach them about it, talking about ways you can resolve the problem.


Try approaching it from a sympathetic perspective, which will make the person less defensive. For example, you could say something such as, ""You may not realize it, but I think you've been taking my food from the refrigerator. I'm not trying to attack you about it. I just want to figure out a solution. If we can't figure out a solution, I'll need to bring this topic up with the boss.""

, Another option for dealing with a food thief is to take the information to your boss. Of course, you only want to do so if you are absolutely sure that the person is thief. You should also have evidence to back up your claim, not just hearsay.

, If it is your boss who's stealing or your boss won't deal with the situation, you can take it to human resources if you're in a big company, as they are more equipped to deal with the problem. Otherwise, you may need to just confront them. "
"
Carefully document each instance of theft.,
Look for inconsistencies in your records.,
Pay extra attention to special register functions.,
If cash is being stolen, instate a register-counting system.,
When possible, consult video surveillance data.,
Hold one-on-one employee interviews for information.,
Consider hiring an outside investigator for an internal audit.,
Confront stealing employees only when you have convincing evidence.",How to Catch Someone Stealing at Work1," Your biggest friend when it comes to catching thieves in your workforce is information. As soon as you notice that a theft has occurred, make a major effort to gather information that can help you pinpoint when, where, and, if possible, around whom the theft took place.


Data you may want to record and/or search your records for can include:

The exact time and date of when the cash or merchandise was first noticed missing
Starting and final totals for each register or point of sale (for when cash is being stolen)
Inventory counts and sales reports (for when goods are being stolen)
Names of employees working at the time the theft may have taken place
If possible, records of access card swipes, etc.
Employee expense reports
Records of equipment checkout


If you don't have this information, start recording it once you suspect a theft. This alone may be enough to discourage further theft, but if it doesn't, you'll be better prepared to catch thieving employees in the future.;
, Narrow your search down by checking your records for instances where ""the numbers don't add up."" In other words, look for spots where money or goods appear to go missing. The better your record-keeping, the more likely you'll be able to find concrete evidence of theft.


For example, let's say that, when examining your inventory records, you notice that your records for one day show that you had 20 expensive smartphones in stock at the start of the day and that you had 10 in stock at the end of the day, but you only have records of nine being sold. This is a definite red flag and cause for future investigation.

, Employees that steal cash from their register at work often use a set of related tactics to cover their tracks. These basically involve inputting certain functions into the cash register incorrectly, then using the opportunity to pocket some cash. For example, a dishonest employee may use a register's ""no sale"" function to steal — when a customer hands over cash for her purchase, the employee may input the ""no sale"" command (which opens the register), pay the customer their change, and pocket a bill from the now-open register. The customer is unlikely to notice, and no sale is recorded.Register functions that you may want to monitor closely include:

No sale
Refund
$0 sale items
Reports or print-outs (dishonest employees may pocket money paid while the register system is undergoing a report)


O'Dell Restaurant Consulting offers a comprehensive guide to common employee theft tactics, some of which take advantage of these special functions, here. While the focus is restaurant-centered, many of the tactics discussed are applicable to other fields like retail as well.

, One common way to fight register theft is to use a system where each employee ""checks out"" a register cash box at the start of the shift and returns it at the end of the shift. When the cashbox is checked out, the money in it is counted, and when it's returned, the money is counted again and compared to a sales report. This system is relatively easy to put in place and, while it won't stop all forms of register theft, it will catch blatant thieves easily.


Using a standardized check-in/check-out spreadsheet can make this system much easier for both employees and their supervisors. Rows that you'll probably want to include on your spreadsheet include:Starting cash
Cash sales
Credit card/check sales
Total sales
Ending cash



, If your business has a CCTV security system, examine the footage for evidence of stealing (especially if the cameras are pointed at locations where theft is likely to occur, like cash registers.) Use the information you've gathered to narrow down the time and place that the theft occurred to as small of range as possible, then watch closely for telltale signs of thievery, including:


An employee's hands passing bills from a register into her pockets
Bills going from a register to a tip jar
Strange habits around a cash register (e.g., some dishonest employees may subtly mark registers to remind themselves how much they've stolen so they can modify their reports accordingly)Merchandise going into coats, purses, backpacks, and so on
""Good"" merchandise going into the garbageUnauthorized access to safes, cash boxes, etc.
After-hours access to the building

, While a thieving employee is unlikely to admit to his crime if you confront him directly, honest coworkers may be willing to point you in the right direction. Consider calling your employees to your office for a personal, open discussion about the theft you've been experiencing. You can ask them if they know anything about employees who are stealing or if they're willing to help you work to stop this problematic behavior. You can also take the opportunity to remind your employees about your business's policies regarding theft.


When you conduct interviews, make sure that your interviews are done one-on-one behind closed doors. Your employees are most likely to be honest when they don't have to fear running afoul of other employees.
You'll also probably want to interview as much of your workforce as you can (every employee, if possible.) This gives your employees plausible deniability — in other words, if their information leads to a firing, it will be harder for the employee who gets fired to figure out who outed him.

, It's worth mentioning that owners and supervisors don't necessarily have to fight workplace theft on their own. A huge variety of independent consultants and investigation firms specializing in company security and theft prevention are available for help. While the cost of hiring this sort of outside help may not make it worth it for small incidents of theft, these third-party solutions can be indispensable for larger problems.


This sort of help can also be especially useful when the theft is occurring at the bookkeeping level of a business. Dishonest bookkeepers can potentially bilk relatively large amounts of money from a company's payrolls without calling attention to themselves, making an objective outside auditor highly useful.

, Don't make accusations of theft or fire employees without strong justification for your actions. Doing this can lower morale in your workforce and give the impression that you are liable to fire your employees on a whim. These problems may be especially bad if it eventually becomes clear that you were wrong about which employees were responsible for the theft. To avoid these issues, wait until you can prove a theft before you act rashly.


In addition, it's important to note that if the employee you fire without proof of wrongdoing has a contract that guaranteed some form of job security, this may constitute wrongful termination, which can leave you vulnerable to a lawsuit. However, most employment in the United States is ""at will"" — that is, employees can be fired at any time, for any reason, or for no reason at all."

Having an anonymous tip or feedback system in place makes it relatively simple for your employees to report thefts and other inappropriate behavior without feeling unsafe or threatened. In addition, this gives employees a chance to voice their concerns, complaints, and constructive criticism in hopes of improving the workplace.


Good ideas for anonymous tip systems include:

A feedback box left somewhere (like a break room) where employees won't be noticed dropping their notes in
An email account that automatically censors the addresses of employees that send messages to it
A third-party anonymous feedback program (i.e., 3sixty, Suggestionox, etc.), Employees are much less likely to steal from cash registers with the special function tricks discussed above if they know that these sort of functions are automatically brought to the attention of their employers. Consider using software that reports these functions or asks for a manager's credentials to confirm them to keep your business's points of sale under control.These exception-reporting functions usually come standard on modern point of sale systems. If your business uses an old, out-of-date cash register, consider upgrading to for greater security options.
Good modern point of service products include:AmberPOS
Vend POS
Lightspeed Retail
iVend Retail
NCR Counterpoint POS and Retail Management



, To a dishonest employee, the idea that you, the supervisor, are constantly watching can be a major incentive to stop stealing. Placing just a few cameras in high-risk locations (like pointed at cash registers, in locations where high-value goods are stored, and so on) can dramatically discourage stealing and can provide invaluable evidence in the event that it does occur.


There is even some evidence that fake (or ""dummy"" security cameras) can deter thefts as well (this, of course, relies on the dishonest employee not knowing that the video camera is a fake.)However, this low-cost option is generally recommended to increase the perceived coverage of an existing security system — not to replace it entirely., A business's ability to monitor its employees while they work isn't necessarily limited to video surveillance. A variety of other surveillance tools are also available — depending on how serious you believe your theft problem is, you may or may not want to pursue these optional solutions. Make sure that any monitoring you do does not violate your local laws or the terms of employment you agreed to with your employees. In addition, make sure that you duly notify your employees before any extra surveillance begins.


Extra methods of surveillance can include:Instituting internet history checks
Automatically scanning communications for suspicious keywords
Monitoring text messages, emails, wi-fi connections on personal devices, etc.
Hiring security guards
Using keycard logging software record access to important areas


Note, however, that it's important to be aware of the dangers of too much surveillance. Making your employees feel that they are in a ""big brother""-type relationship can have an adverse effect on morale, especially if the surveillance you perform isn't common in your field of business., Most business resources identify three main ""reasons"" for employee theft: the employee may have some sort of drastic expense outside of work that requires extra money; the employee may feel abused or under-appreciated; and the employee may simply act because the opportunity presents itself. While it's impossible to account for the first problem and the third problem is a matter of tightening your business's record keeping practices and increasing employee surveillance, the second is largely a matter of how your employees feel. Simply put, employees are less likely to steal at work if they like they employer and feel that their work is valuable.


Here are some ideas for fostering rewarding relationships with your employees:

Frequently talk to your employees informally about their lives, aspirations, and so on.
Offer extra rewards and bonuses for outstanding work.
Make an effort to talk with each employee individually at least a little.
Consider organizing outside-of-work social activities (holiday parties, happy hour outings, etc.)
Empathize with your employees' potential complaints and frustrations.


Consider this: in a 1976 survey, over half of all respondents who admitted to stealing from their employer claimed to have done so with ""no guilt.""Don't be the sort of boss that people are glad to steal from — instead, get ahead of the problem by being your employees' friend.

, Though rare, it is possible for employees to steal from a business after they stop working for it, especially if they're allowed to keep their keys, company credentials, and so on. To prevent this, perform a ""reset"" of all your security systems after firing employees. Depending on your business, this may include:


Changing the building's locks
Changing codes to any electronic locks
Changing the login information for company email accounts, wi-fi, etc.
Reclaiming any keys, key cards, or entry credentials from the fired employee

, The problem of workplace theft has inspired many businesses to get creative in their efforts. While the solutions below may not be appropriate for every workplace, there is evidence that they can curb theft in certain situations.



Use clear trash bags. Employees may hide merchandise in the trash, then stash it in a safe spot when they take the garbage out. Clear trash bags make this harder to accomplish.Require all boxes to be flattened before recycling. This makes it harder to steal merchandise in boxes via the trash method above.Rearrange furniture or remodel to eliminate blind spots. Employees are less likely to steal when there are fewer spots from which they can't be seen.Use random register audits/inspections. Though employees may not like it, they're certainly less likely to steal if there's a chance that their register may be taken and audited at any time.""

Give occasional ""freebies."" Giving your employees unwanted merchandise for free is one way to create an anti-stealing incentive. For instance, if you run a restaurant and you find that employees frequently steal food, consider setting up a system where employees can take home any food they want as long as it would otherwise go into the trash.

If you notice something suspicious, contact your boss.,
Use anonymous feedback/complaint systems.,
Gather information carefully, but don't be overzealous.,
Avoid impulsive accusations.",How to Catch Someone Stealing at Work3," As an employee, you don't have the same sort of power that your bosses do when it comes to making big, structural changes to your company in an effort to stop workplace theft. However, this doesn't mean you can't be an immense help. If you see, hear, or otherwise observe anything that makes you think theft is taking place, talk to a supervisor immediately. Don't stay silent — keep in mind, according to many workplace's rules, allowing another employee to steal can mean implicating yourself in the crime.


At many workplaces, especially ones where there is a major gulf between low-level employees and the management staff or where the employees are unhappy with their jobs, there may be a ""culture of silence"" surrounding the act of workplace theft — that is, thieving employees expect others to cover for them and may use bullying or shunning to punish employees who speak out. In this case, don't ruin your relationship with your fellow employees by going directly to a boss while you're at work. Instead, contact your boss via email, over the phone, or with one of the anonymous methods below.

, Unfortunately, at some workplaces, it may be ill-advised to earn yourself a reputation as the sort of person who reports workplace theft. In this case, try to report the theft anonymously. This way, the management can deal with the theft, but other employees won't be able to trace your actions back to you.


Options you may want to consider include:

Slipping an anonymous note under your boss's door
Writing information on an anonymous feedback card
Sending your boss an email from a ""throwaway"" email account (one that you make and use only once)
Meeting your boss outside of work to discuss the problem



, If you see an opportunity to document an act of workplace theft with your own notes, pictures, or video footage, you may do so, but be careful. If the employee committing the theft notices you documenting him, he'll probably stop immediately and won't act out around you again, potentially making it harder for you to prove that he's stolen in the long run. In a worst-case scenario, you may even find yourself labeled a ""snitch"" and have your relationship with the other employees damaged.


Note that, often, it's enough to make a mental note of when and where the theft occurred and who was involved. If your boss considers you to be trustworthy and your information matches discrepancies in your employer's records, your boss may have enough information to act on even without pictures, videos, or other extra evidence.

, Employees have a duty to talk to their employers if and when they have information relating to workplace theft. However, they should not accuse other employees of theft when there isn't any sort of conclusive evidence to support their claims. In addition, even if there is evidence that an employee has been stealing, they should not attempt to humiliate the thief in front of other employees or customers.


Not only can these sorts of unsupported accusations be very embarrassing if they're proven wrong, but they can also have a negative effect on company morale by promoting a feeling that employees are subject to ""witch hunts"" at a moment's notice.

Ask the person.,
Think about his or her tone.,
Subtly ask around.,
Look at your own performance.,
Observe the jerk's performance.,
Look at the type of work he or she does.,
Look into his or her home life respectfully.",How to Deal with a Jerk at Work1," Of course, you won't want to walk up to the jerk and say ""why are you mean to me?"" Instead, tell him or her you want to get along with everyone at work, and ask if there is something you should or shouldn't be doing. It is possible that he or she simply is not familiar with you, and having this face-to-face may break the ice.


If you don't feel comfortable having this conversation, you may need to try more indirect methods.;
, If either of you is new to the job, you simply may not know each other yet. Many people deal with stressful or dissatisfying workplace environments with sarcastic annoyance. However, if his or her comments are truly hurtful and/or aimed only at you or a select group of people, keep an eye on the behavior.


Don’t let 1 or 2 interactions constitute your opinion of your new coworker. Only make up your mind that he or she is a jerk after an established pattern of behavior.

, You need to be careful when asking your coworkers if they have noticed the jerk’s behavior. You don’t want to mislead people into thinking there is a rivalry or conflict that needs resolving. However, it may be useful to ask a simple question that allows others to confide in you. After all, if the jerk in question is having trouble at home, you don’t want to add to his or her pain by starting gossip about him or her at work.


Don’t schedule appointments or go out of your way to have these conversations. If you do, however, casually find yourself in a somewhat private situation, mention your coworker’s behavior.
You might say something like, “Bob seems a bit tense today,” or something more targeted like, “the way Bob acts lately you’d think I did something to him.” Make your question or comment appropriate for how well you know the third party.

, Unfortunately, some people deal with struggling coworkers by being rude instead of helping them improve. This may be unpleasant, but you should think about whether the jerk's comments relate to your mistakes. This doesn’t mean he or she is in the right. It is, though, a necessary element to recognize so you can suggest it as the root of your coworker's unfriendliness when you talk with him or her, your boss, or other appropriate department.


You might later say, “Bob has been short and unfriendly with me lately, and I just wonder if it is because I lost the Randleman account.” Don’t sound like you are too sure about this, because an impartial observer may quickly tell you some other more likely reason – perhaps he or she are going through a divorce and you hadn’t heard yet.

, The problem may not lie with you. He or she may not be performing well, and feel the need to compensate by acting more serious at work. For some people, this translates into eliminating friendliness. If you are doing particularly well, he or she may see you as a competitor and even be jealous of your performance., Not all jobs are rainbows and unicorns, and not all people are meant for the role they play at work. If your job itself is a source of dissatisfaction and stress, and isn’t rewarding, that may be the reason the jerk isn't always nice. Not everyone copes with these drawbacks of employment well, so try to be understanding.


Refrain from telling the jerk he or she is being whiny or ungrateful. That is more combative than calming. Remember that not everyone gets the same benefits from a shared experience, like their job.

, Tread lightly with this one. If both of you seem to be performing well and there has been no major change in work recently, it may be a personal problem. This is another time it might help to ask a coworker. An even better option might be to mention it to your supervisor. Make sure you are coming from a place of concern, not accusation.


You might say, “Bob has been short and even rude with me lately. Do you know if he’s having problems outside the office? I just want to be as understanding as possible.”
Other signs you might look for may be frequent calls from home; if he or she regularly arrives late or leave early; if he or she seems stressed or tired every day; or if his or her unhappiness is evident even when no one is around.

Control your anger.,
Remain kind and friendly.,
Do your job well.,
Minimize your contact with the jerk.,
Vent at home if necessary.,
Focus on work only at work.,
Identify patterns of rudeness.,
Learn you might have to accept it.",How to Deal with a Jerk at Work2," If the jerk is merely trying to get a ‘rise’ out of people, try to deny him or her this. More importantly, you don’t want his or her unfriendliness to escalate into an actual conflict. Let that person play the role of the office jerk. Remember the aspects of your job and your home life that make you happy and try to move past the jerk's unfriendliness., If the jerk is intentionally being unfriendly with you, he or she will be put off by your continued kindness. However, don’t ‘smother’ him or her with kindness. It will be obvious if you are trying to combat his or her unfriendliness with the opposite. You don’t want to come off as trying to combat their behavior in any way. That will only prolong the behavior, and even turn it into a dispute.For example, a cheery “good morning” as he or she passes by is always appropriate. However, don’t make a point of walking over to his or her work station every morning and asking a lot of questions about his or her plans the previous evening with a big smile on your face.

, Remember you are not at work to make friends. Punch the clock, do your job, punch the clock again, and go home. Focusing on your job is another way to keep from dwelling on a jerk's behavior. Additionally, if he or she is being rude to you because you aren’t performing well, this should help. It shows you are trying to improve and you take the job seriously.

, There is, almost certainly, no line in your hiring paperwork that says you have to be friends with your coworkers. Interact with unfriendly coworkers when you need to and be pleasant when you are around them. Don’t try to force relationships to get better by regularly sitting next to a particularly unfriendly coworker at lunch. Not everyone will get along, and that is ok.

, A better way to release the tension of dealing with a rude coworker is telling your spouse or friend at home. Do a better job of keeping your unpleasant thoughts out of the workplace than he or she does. Find people you can talk to, but who will also help you move on with your life.

, Remember that old saying, “living well is the best revenge?” The jerk may have problems at home that make him or her need to feel like the alpha dog at work. Though your chosen career should be fulfilling and satisfying, strive for a healthy work-life balance. It is ok to vent on especially bad days, but recognize that your rude coworker may not change. Start to think instead about what you want to do after work on your commute home rather than dwelling on, for example, Bob’s rude comment at lunch.

, The best way to cope with a rude colleague is by minimizing the number of times you let him or her surprise you. This means hearing a rude quip or comment and thinking, for example, ‘well, that’s Bob for you.’ It can be difficult to do, as most people do not repeat themselves word-for-word every day. However, there should be distinct patterns to his or her unfriendliness. Remember that this is a way of brushing off the jerk's rudeness, not validating it.


For example, you might notice that he or she makes a comment or chuckles every time you answer a question wrong in meetings. Though the comment may be different, accept it as today’s rude outburst.
Another pattern of rude behavior might be consistently challenging your suggestions. As long as you don’t let his or her grandstanding get in the way of doing the job well, it might be harmless. Calmly explain your rationale and let other coworkers help you make the right decision.

, It is an unfortunate aspect of human behavior that we don’t like to change – especially when others tell us to. Hopefully the jerk's rudeness will subside with time, but it may not. Remember that your coworkers are not the same as friends or family, and focus on the other aspects of your life. You might need to give up trying to control their behavior. The less you let yourself dwell on their rudeness, the happier you will be.

Address the person in private.,
Report it to a supervisor.,
Go to human resources or similar department.,
Report the actions higher up the food chain.,
Consult an attorney.,
Consider a different job as a last resort.",How to Deal with a Jerk at Work3," You may not feel comfortable doing this, so it will be a decision you have to make. Ask your friends or family at home if they recommend a confrontation. Make sure to keep the conversation casual so that the jerk doesn't think you’re trying to corner him or her. You also don’t want to violate any workplace regulations. For example, don’t talk to the jerk in private if he or she is not only unfriendly, but also aggressive. You don’t want to put your safety at risk. If this is true, it is probably a sign that you need to get a third party involved.
If he or she simply makes snarky comments that offend you, it is a good idea to let the person know gently, in private.
Make mention of the specific behaviors that are inappropriate. Take this as an opportunity to air out any grievances this person may have about you and vice versa, but don’t let it get too long-winded. He or she may not have realized their actions, and feel immediate remorse.

, The jerk may tell you he or she doesn’t care about your feelings. He or she may simply go on acting the same way no matter what. If the behavior continues, go directly to your supervisor to report any incidents. If there is truly harmful or abusive behavior, the company needs to document and address the problem., You may feel that management is not addressing the issue sufficiently, or that the jerk is becoming abusive. Most companies will not allow such behavior especially if it has racial, age, or sexual undertones. Offenses such as this generally require formal reprimands so as to protect the company from a lawsuit.


Tell the staff, for example, that Bob has made a number of age-related jokes that are increasingly unfriendly. You asked him politely to stop, but he hasn’t.

, If your company is not dealing with the problem, go to management or corporate administration. Your company may have a toll-free line you can call. This is an unfortunate situation, because it can seriously jeopardize your employment if the call is taken the wrong way by your supervisors. However, you don’t need to put up with abusive coworkers because of potential intimidation from your company.

, You may not be able to resolve the problem in-house. This may seem like a drastic step, but remember that workplaces do not exist in a bubble. There are civil laws that can be broken, and if the behavior constitutes abuse or harassment, you can file a suit against your coworker. This is especially important if it is a serious problem that your company refuses to address., If the jerk's behavior is very unpleasant, but doesn’t actually break any rules, you may not be able to change him or her. Don’t put your happiness on the back burner – this is a matter of your mental health. If you are secure enough in your career to move to another company, look around quietly. It may even be an opportunity for you to make a life-change that you have been putting off for years.

Say ""hi"" or ""hello"" whenever we see them.,
Offer a helping hand.,
Respect them.,
Be courteous at all times.,
Compliment them.,
Avoid gossips.,
Remember special dates.,
Never, ever engage in a fight.",How to Deal with a Coworker,"  Greeting people even when they are busy means a lot.  We recognize their presence and most people want that.  (In case they look like they're too busy and can't be bothered just stop by where they are working and smile.);
,  Most people in our workplaces are always busy with something.  If you have spare time and you know you can be of help, don't hesitate to help.  We all need a helping hand in one way or another.

,  Respect their time by making sure that you don't indulge in lengthy conversations with them knowing that you all have things to do.  Respect their things.  Yes, you may be acquaintances or friends already, but it doesn't give you the entitlement to open their drawers when you ran out of paperclips or A4 papers. 

,  Always address your coworkers appropriately.  You can use ""Ma'am, Miss, Sir, Mister"" regardless of their age.  Never forget the three most famous magic words, ""Thank you, I'm sorry, and You're welcome.""

,  Receiving encouraging words after doing something good boosts one's ego and confidence.  Most of us like being complimented so compliment them in return.  This world is a much better place with people who knows how to appreciate others.

,  How easy it is to gossip about your boss, colleague, or anyone you see! But NEVER, EVER do that! It can tear people apart and break relationships.  If you find yourself in a conversation with other coworkers talking about this and that, walk out politely or respectfully tell them what you feel about gossiping.

,  As you spend more time in your workplace you can become more familiar with people and their stories.  If you heard that someone is celebrating a birthday, greet them or even yet get them a card or a gift.  If someone lost a loved one, sympathize/empathize with them.  If someone gave birth, congratulate them or visit them.  It's great caring for others!

,  Yes, arguments can happen in our workplaces but even then we have to keep our cool and stay calm as we present our views.  Be careful with your words, even with your intonation as sometimes when we raise our voices most people think we are already mad.  IF, you argued or had a fight with a coworker, be quick to apologize.  As what Gandhi said, ""Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.""

Express yourself using “I” statements so that you are easily understood. Use phrases like:

""I feel like my suggestions aren't being taken seriously.""
""I think we should should consider another method.""


Make sure that your words match your body language. Saying something positive with negative body language (like slumped shoulders or while rolling your eyes) can confuse people or make you appear dishonest. ;
, In order to be a team player, you have to know what your coworkers and bosses want and need. Actively listen to what they are saying before deciding on a course of action.Make eye contact while listening. This shows the person your attention is on them.
Repeat important points back to the person to show them you understand. This also gives them a chance to clarify in case you haven’t understood.Use phrases like ""So, you mean we need to find some new clients?""



, Do not wait for your coworkers or bosses to give you feedback on your work. Instead, actively seek it out. Your coworkers are valuable resources that can help you improve as a worker and team player.


Ask your coworkers and bosses what you could be doing better to help the team or how you can work more efficiently. Ask them: ""How could my work on this have helped your do your job better?""
Seeking feedback shows your coworkers that you care about their opinion.

Accept and act on the feedback. Sometimes feedback can hurt, but in the long run it will help you develop as a worker and team player., Your bosses and coworkers rely on you not just to narrowly do your job, but to contribute to the overall success of the project. Do not be afraid to speak your mind and give your opinion on the project. Be forthcoming and honest.Employers prefer workers who are willing to be assertive and who actively participate above those who are silent, regardless of who hard they work., If you do not understand something, do not be afraid to ask for clarification. Seek out the person who can help you clarify the information and ask them directly.


Many workers fail to get their work done not out of laziness or malice, but because they did not fully understand the work they were supposed to be doing. Make sure that you understand what the team expects of you by getting clarification on your responsibilities when you are not completely certain., Offering your thoughts will keep you an active helper in the decision-making process and show you have an interest in the team.


When discussing a topic at a meeting, do not assume everyone has thought of the same problems, issues, or ideas as you. Instead, actively engage with your coworkers by sharing your ideas.
Your participation matters to the team. Just as you rely on your coworkers to participate, they rely on you. By participating you are helping everyone, including yourself.

, Treat them with respect by being polite, not interrupting them, and avoiding office gossip.


Be considerate of your coworkers' backgrounds.
Try to see things from your coworkers' or boss’s perspectives.
Appreciate that someone with a different background than you can bring an idea to a problem that might never have occurred to you., Part of being a team player is helping deal with problems and difficult situations. Instead of passing a problematic issue off on someone else, do what you can to support coworkers and find a solution to the problem.


Do not wait until someone asks you before you do something that you know needs to be done.
Take the initiative and solve the problem while it is still small and before it grows into a bigger problem that affects your team.

, As a team player, you will not always get to do things your way all the time. Be willing to compromise on issues and take into consideration the needs of the team.


Consider why things might need to be done differently than you originally thought, and be willing to change your mind.
Ask questions if you do not understand why someone needs you to do something differently.

""How is my current workflow hurting the team's efficiency?""


When you are willing to compromise with your coworkers, they will be more willing to compromise with you. When you compromise, you are helping to establish that the team works with one another rather than against one another., Setting goals will help you and your work much more effectively. Evaluate those goals regularly to ensure you and your team are making the progress you expect to be making.


Discuss goals with the whole team to ensure that everyone understands what needs to be done and knows their specific piece of the puzzle.
Review your progress toward your goal frequently. Often times, the goals or conditions of the project will change. Consistent review will help you to avoid wasting time on things that are not helping you achieve your goals., Part of being a helpful member of a team is being reliable. Show up to work on time and meet deadlines consistently. Reliable and consistent performance will earn favor with your boss and camaraderie from teammates.


Do not over promise. Be forthright about what you can and cannot actually deliver. Your bosses and coworkers will be much happier knowing up front that they need to find another solution than if they find out only when you have been unable to deliver on your promise.Be honest. While it may feel right in the moment not to disappoint someone, you will be hurting yourself and your team more in the long run if you make a promise you cannot keep., If you consistently go out of your way to do more than the bare minimum, then your coworkers will come to trust and rely on you as a coworker and teammate.


Be creative and come up with ideas that can help the team solve problems.
Consider taking on more responsibilities if you can realistically complete them, rather than waiting for someone to ask you to do more work. Not only will you be taking the initiative and helping the team, it will give you more influence over the type of work you are doing. , Sometimes, you will fail or make a mistake. A good team player will own up to their mistake and take action to fix it rather than blaming it on someone or something else. Sometimes things really were out of your control, but coworkers and bosses will respect you for taking responsibility and the initiative to fix the problem.


Be willing to admit you could have done something differently.Admitting your mistakes will also help build your relationship with your teammates and make them more willing to work with you.

, Come in a little early or stay late to help meet a group goal. Being flexible with your schedule shows willingness to do what's best for the team.


Be willing to adapt to the situation. Sometimes you will need to revise your plan when conditions change.
When you realize something needs to change, move quickly to make the change.
Being flexible shows that you are able to work in varied conditions, a valuable skill in a fast-paced workplace. , Give a coworker constructive feedback for problems with clients or projects. Sharing your knowledge will make you a valuable, trusted workplace team player. Approach your coworker and ask them if they would like your help or advice with the problem they are having, in order to be sensitive to them if they have recently failed or made a mistake.


Constructive criticism has to come from a place of trust and personal humility. Coworkers will sense if you are being condescending. This will hurt both you and the team. Make sure your feedback is specific and not judgmental. Your constructive criticism should be aimed at helping the person and not at calling someone out on his or her failure.
Timing matters. You may want to wait before engaging with someone who has just failed at a task, particularly in public. Wait until they have had time to become less emotional and offer them help based on your own experience., You are working hard anyway, so take a moment to do the small things that improve everyone’s quality of life on your team. You are more likely to be viewed as a workplace team player if you treat coworkers with courtesy and help out around the office.

Greet them each day.,
Make yourself available.,
Be attentive.,
Act interested by asking open-ended questions.,
Resist being rude when you're caught up in work.",How to Be Friends with Your Coworkers1," Before approaching and initiating a friendship opportunity with a coworker, be sure to take note of the overall office culture. Each company has it’s own culture with varying atmospheres, attitudes, beliefs, values, morals, and other attributes. How are all of these shared between the team members and how do they communicate between one another? Observing this will help you identify the most acceptable way to mingle with coworkers.


Be extra careful with how you interact with coworkers of a different status; appropriate conversation may be more restricted in this circumstance.;
, The first step to making a friend anywhere is to say “hello.” It would be quite challenging to befriend someone you’ve never actually spoken to. Whether you’re interested in one friend in particular or the group as a whole, start by greeting your coworkers with a warm smile each day.You might simply say, “Morning!” when you enter the office. Or, address one coworker specifically, like “Good morning, Rosa! How was your commute?”

, Typically, the aura you give off at work lets your coworkers know whether you are open to socializing. If you enter the office without speaking, go straight to your cubicle and remain there for the rest of the day, you’ll have trouble connecting with your coworkers.Instead, try some tips to show them you’re open and willing to connect. If you have an office, leave your door open unless it’s necessary to close it. Eat lunch in the common room rather than sitting at your cubicle or going outside alone.

, When engaged in conversation with a coworker, focus on making them feel like they are the most important person in the room. If you do this, they will be encouraged to chat with you in the future.


For instance, don’t glance down at your watch or turn your body towards the exit. Make eye contact, use open body language (i.e. unfolded arms and legs), and actively listen.

, Here’s a secret: people love to talk about themselves. You’ll likely win over your coworkers more easily if you act interested in them. Take advantage of natural breaks in your workday to get to know your coworkers better.


Use open ended-questions that get the conversation flowing. These might sound like “I heard you mention hockey. What got you interested in the sport?” or “You sure look content this Monday, Donna! How’d you spend your weekend?”, If you are cordial at work, others will likely gravitate to you. This doesn’t mean dismissing your work responsibilities for the sake of making friends. It means not being so caught up in getting ahead that you shut out opportunities to connect.For instance, your coworker knocks on your door and invite you to after-work drinks. Without glancing away from your computer, you say, “I don’t have time. I’ve got to meet this deadline.” Responding this way may come off as rude and unapproachable—your coworker may not extend an invitation in the future.
Even if you can’t join in, you might make eye contact, offer an encouraging smile, and say, “Oh, thanks for the invite, Sam. Sadly, I’m struggling to meet a deadline. But once I get this project complete, I’d love to take you up on that offer.”

Wait for your results.",How to Calculate Alabama Unemployment," In order to be eligible for unemployment benefits in Alabama, you must have lost your job through no fault of your own. You may be disqualified from receiving benefits if you voluntarily quit your job without a good cause, were discharged for misconduct, or lost your job due to a work stoppage resulting from a labor dispute.


The Alabama Department of Labor (DoL) will ask you why you lost your job when you fill out an application for benefits. The DoL will also mail a form to your past employers when you file a claim for unemployment benefits. The DoL will analyze each response and may ask you for a follow-up interview if they feel it is necessary.;
, When you apply for unemployment benefits, the DoL will assess your past wages in order to determine whether you have earned enough in the past to be eligible for unemployment benefits. Before you apply for benefits, you will want to calculate your possible benefits package so you have an understanding of your eligibility. Calculating your own benefits will also help you identify and fix any errors the DoL might make on determination.


To be eligible, you must have insured wages in at least two quarters of your base period and your total base period wages must equal or exceed 1 1/2 times your high quarter earnings. Insured wages are wages earned while working for an employer who is subject to the Alabama Unemployment Compensation Law.Your average quarterly earnings during your two high quarters must be at least $1,157.01., If you want unemployment benefits, you must be able, seeking, and willing to immediately accept full-time work. This must be the case for each week you are drawing benefits. Therefore, if you reside outside of the United States, you will not be able to successfully file a claim for benefits.Therefore, to ensure you receive benefits, make sure you stay close to home and that you are willing to work at a moments notice.

, Not only will you need to be willing to work, but you must also be able to work in order to be eligible for benefits. If you are sick or hurt and not able to work, benefits may be denied until a time when you provide proof of your ability to continue working., At various points throughout the benefits period, you may be asked to take part in fact-finding interviews, profile interviews, and eligibility reviews. If you are called upon to participate, you must do so in order to remain eligible. If you fail to take part in a review and you do not have a valid excuse, you may be denied benefits., You must do everything in your power to secure employment. To successfully search for work, you should apply to jobs with employers who usually hire people with your skill set, do so in-person when possible, and do so with the person that normally does the hiring., If you refuse an offer for a job or refuse to respond to a possible job referral, your benefits may be delayed. To avoid this, you should accept any suitable offer for work you get. A suitable offer is will be determined by your past training and experience, the details of the job, and the local market where you reside., If you make any money while receiving benefits, you must report that money to DoL immediately. Wages, vacation pay, holiday pay, workers' compensation, and sick pay may disqualify you from receiving benefits., If you are not a United States citizen or do not have permission to work in the United States, you will not be able to receive unemployment benefits. If you are an alien with permission to work, you will have to provide DoL with your alien registration number., If you attend college, a vocational school, or GED classes, you will still be eligible for benefits so long as you remain able and willing to work. If work arises, you must accept it so long as it is suitable, even if it means changing your education schedule.


If you are still in high school, you are not eligible to receive unemployment benefits., Every week you wish to remain eligible, you will need to file a weekly certification. This certification ensures you are continuing to do everything you are supposed to be doing in order to remain eligible. DoL will ask you various questions pertaining to all of the qualifications necessary to receive benefits. You can file your weekly certification online or over the phone., To determine if you have enough wages to qualify, and to ensure your wages have been calculated correctly by DoL, you should always calculate your benefits package for your own records. To start the calculation, you will first need to determine your base period. Your base period is the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters before the week you file your claim. There are four calendar quarters in every year.


To determine your base period, use the chart in the DoL's Handbook, which can be found at http://www.labor.alabama.gov/docs/guides/uc_brr.pdf. Find the month in the far right row in which you filed your claim. The four shaded quarters in the same row will be your base period.For example, claims made in January, February or March will use a base period consisting of the fourth, third, second and first calendar quarters.

, Your high quarter is the base period quarter in which you were paid the highest amount of wages. You will take your two highest quarters and add them together.For example, let's assume your first quarter earnings were $6,500, your second quarter earnings were $2,000, your third quarter earnings were $7,000, and your fourth quarter earnings were $1,500. To calculate your high quarter earnings, you would add together your first and third quarter earnings, which would give you a total of $13,500 ($6,500 + $7,000).

, You will next need to find your average high quarter earnings by dividing the sum of your two highest quarters by two. This average must equal at least $1,157.01 in order for you to be eligible for unemployment.For example, if the sum of your two highest earning quarters is $13,500, you will divide this number by two in order to get your average high quarter earnings. In this scenario, your average high quarter earnings would equal $6,750. Because this number exceeds the $1,157.01 minimum, you would pass the first monetary hurdle to qualifying.

, The next step is to determine the sum of all of your base period wages, which you can do by adding up all of your wages in your base period. In order for you to be eligible for unemployment benefits, your total base period wages must equal or exceed 1 1/2 times your high quarter earnings.For example, let's assume your total base period wages equal $17,000 ($6,500 + $2,000 + $7,000 + $1,500). If you multiply your high quarter earnings ($7,000) by 1 1/2 you get $10,500. Because $17,000 is more than $10,500, you would pass the second monetary hurdle to qualifying.

, Now that you know whether you are monetarily eligible, you will be able to calculate what your weekly benefit rate would be. A benefit year is a 52 week period in which you can claim benefits. However, the maximum benefit amount you can draw during that 52 week period is an amount equal to a maximum of 26 weeks.Therefore, to determine your weekly benefit rate, you will divide the average of the two highest paying quarters by 26.


The minimum amount you could receive is $45 and the maximum amount is $265.For example, let's assume your average two highest paying quarters equals $6,750. You would divide this number by 26 and you would get $259.62. This is the amount of money you would be eligible to receive every week for a maximum of 26 weeks during a 52 week period.

, Once you have calculated your benefits and you believe you are eligible to receive them, you will need to file your claim with DoL. Before you file your claim, you should have the following information on hand:


Your Social Security number;
Your driver's license or Alabama ID;
Your alien registration card (if applicable);
A list of names, addresses, phone numbers, and employment dates for your last two employers;
Information about any federal civilian employment, military service, or work performed in another state in the past 18 months; and
Your bank account number and routing number., You can file your claim online using the DoL website.When you get there, you will follow the directions on the screen in order to complete the filing process. You will use the various information you gathered throughout the application process.

, If you do not have access to the internet, you can also file your claim over the telephone. While on the phone you will be asked a series of questions that you will answer by pressing various keys., After you file you will usually have to wait between two and three weeks to hear the results of your claim. When you hear back you will receive a determination letter laying out two things. First, your letter will conclude whether you are monetarily eligible. Second, your letter will conclude whether you are eligible based on how you were separated from your job.If both of these determinations are made in your favor, you will be eligible to request weekly payments.

Show empathy.,
Remember what’s important to them.,
Lend a hand.,
Ask for help or advice.,
Avoid engaging in office gossip.",How to Be Friends with Your Coworkers2," Empathy is important for all relationships because it helps you built trust and rapport with others. A lack of empathy can make you seem brusque and unfriendly. What’s more, being indifferent to others’ emotional experiences can lead to alienation in the workplace.Demonstrate empathy in your work relationships by paying more attention to the social cues of the environment. You shouldn’t be so caught up in work that you fail to notice your office-mate is crying or has been absent for a week.
When you notice another’s emotions, speak on it. You might say, “You seem upset, Josie. Is there something I can do?” Or, call or email your absentee colleague and say, “I’ve noticed you’ve been out of work for the past few days. Is everything okay? Let me know if there’s anything I can do.”

, Good friends recall the key details of their friends’ lives. To demonstrate your interest and show that you can be a good friend, try to do the same for your coworkers. This shows you’re paying attention and actually makes the two of you feel more connected.If you’re friends on Facebook and know their birthday is coming up, purchase a cupcake or decorate their cubicle for their special day.
If they have kids, try to remember their names and ask about them regularly.
If you go to coffee regularly with a coworker, you might ask, “Non-fat latte and cinnamon scone, again, Tracie?”

, Being helpful is a great quality to have in a friend. If you spot a coworker in a bind, reach out and offer some assistance. They’ll feel like you care. And, you’ll have an opportunity to spend more time with this person and get to know them better.Determine what level of helping best suits your relationship with the person and your office culture. For instance, if your office discourages helping a coworker outside your department, avoid doing so. But, you can still lend a hand if the same person needs help carrying materials to a conference room or if they have trouble setting up the equipment.

, Close relationships are grounded in vulnerability. A person is likely to feel more emotionally connected to you if you show off your vulnerable side. You can do this by requesting their assistance on a work-related matter.You might defer to their expertise on a project like, “Charlie, I know you coordinated the conference last year and you did an awesome job. I’m having a tough time corralling up vendors. Do you have any pointers to help me move this along?
People naturally feel good about helping others. So, asking for help or advice works favorably for both parties.

, If you’re wanting healthy friendships with people in the workplace, it’s best to avoid any form of office gossip. While the smallest gossip chatter may seem harmless and innocent, it can easily spiral out of proportion. It is best to stay out of any gossip you overhear and avoid making any judgments.

Participate in work events.,
Start an office book club.,
Schedule regular lunch dates.,
Invite them somewhere based on their interests.",How to Be Friends with Your Coworkers3," Most companies sponsor a variety of events throughout the year that allow their employees to network and forge bonds with one another. Rather than flaking on these events, try to attend a few and connect with your coworkers outside the office.Examples might include hosting a charity event, participating in a 5k or joining the company baseball team.

, During office-hours, there’s not always adequate time to engage with your coworkers and tease out their interests. A workplace group activity such as a book club can be a terrific platform to forge deeper relationships and figure out what you have in common with one another.Put up a memo or send out an email asking who’s interested in participating in a book club. You and your coworkers can vote on the genre and specific books for each month. Then, meet up over coffee or drinks to discuss the book.
What’s more, if you select business or personal development books, your boss will likely appreciate your willingness to enhance your skills while promoting workplace bonding.

, People naturally bond over meals, so take advantage of the lunch hour to foster potential friendships. Plus, eating together can make you more productive after the lunch hour and serve as a wonderful way to network.You might simply join the group in the office break room or suggest a new restaurant you all can try. For instance, you might say, “I have been dying to try the new deli on the corner. Anyone game to go with me tomorrow for lunch?”

, You don’t have to stick to company events or lunch hour if you’re trying to connect with your coworkers. Listen to their common interests and use what you hear to pursue deeper relationships with one or two people.For instance, if you spotted John reading a poetry book last week, you might casually say, “John, there’s a poetry grand slam happening at a coffee shop next Friday. I know you love poetry. Do you want to go?”
Or, you might invite several people to an activity at once, such a new movie premiere or a community charity event.

Take a minute (or five) to get over the shock and get your brain working again.,
Think about this in the right way.,
Avoid trying to reverse the decision.,
Negotiate the terms of your separation.,
Leave with dignity.,
Tell your family immediately.,
Give yourself healing time.,
Realize that it's not the end of the road.",How to Be Fired Gracefully," Breathe. If you feel like crying, go ahead - it won't change the situation but it will help you cope better if you can unload the emotion.;
, Your first impulse might be to assume you're a bad employee, a bad person or a complete failure, but this is just the panic talking. Instead say to yourself, ""I've been in a job that wasn't a good match for me."" This is important -- it's not the job that's at fault, and it's not you who's at fault -- it's the combination of you and the job that didn't work out. So don't feel ashamed. There are a million reasons for jobs don't work out, and none of them is 100% your fault.

, You may be tempted to ask for one more chance, but you should resist that urge. The decision has been made and is almost always irreversible. Pleading only weakens your negotiating power.

, Your employer wants it to go smoothly so as not to acquire a reputation for cruelty. So here are some of the things you should ask for:


Agree with the employer how they will respond when someone calls them for a reference. The safest option is for them just to say, ""Yes, he was employed here during these dates and our policy is not to discuss performance.""
Ask for a generous separation package. Ask for all your remaining vacation and sick time in cash, and ask for as much separation pay as you think you can get - between one and three months worth. You probably won't get as much as you ask for, but it's a good starting point for negotiation.
Ask for the employer to continue insurance policies for some period. You're entitled to COBRA, but it's expensive, and it's much better if you can continue for a while with your employer's contribution.
Ask for help in finding a new job. Some employers will hook you up with an ""outplacement"" firm who will help you look for a new job. If they don't, ask ""Can you suggest any companies that are hiring people for this kind of position?"" They may be well connected.

, Don't wait until the end of the day -- go clean out your desk and leave immediately. If people stop by to say goodbye, thank them kindly, but don't roam the halls telling people what happened to you. Never ever badmouth your boss or the company -- burning bridges will come back to haunt you.

, Even if you're feeling shocked and ashamed, tell your family what happened and discuss how you should handle it as a family. Though they'll be shocked and dismayed, in the long run this will reduce the amount of anxiety as you start to react together.

, You're going to be tempted to get out and start looking for new work on the next day, but you need to give yourself time to process what just happened, to wash the shame and panic out of your system, and to start thinking clearly. So set a definite period of a week or two and concentrate on taking care of yourself and your family.

, While difficult to do, you have to stop thinking of the termination as the end of something, and start thinking of it as a change of course that might lead you to a better situation. It's definitely not fun, but it might turn into an opportunity.

Make a strong statement against harassment.,
Describe conduct that isn't tolerated in the workplace.,
Outline your complaint resolution procedure.,
Specify the consequences for violation of the anti-harassment policy.,
Provide handbooks and orientation to all new employees.,
Make periodic refresher courses mandatory.,
Monitor your workplace.,
Display educational materials prominently.,
Designate multiple people to handle complaints.,
Take all complaints seriously.,
Protect the confidentiality of employees who complain of harassment.,
Investigate complaints promptly.,
Maintain records of all complaints.,
Enforce anti-harassment policies fairly and consistently.",How to Avoid Workplace Harassment Lawsuits," Begin any written policy with a strongly-worded statement that your company has no tolerance for harassment in the workplace.


Harassment includes any conduct that creates an offensive, intimidating, or hostile work environment.Even without complaints, it only takes one out-of-line employee to create a permissive environment where harassment seems acceptable.
Embody your stance against harassment in a written policy that reassures employees that such activities are not tolerated and that complaints are taken very seriously.
Make sure employees know that your written policy controls, not anything coming from a supervisor or co-worker that might contradict that policy.
Keep in mind that not all forms of harassment necessarily violate state or federal law. For example, federal law does not explicitly protect employees against harassment due to sexual orientation. However, your policy should stress that harassment is unproductive and unwelcome in the workplace, regardless of whether it is specifically prohibited by law.;
, Providing examples can help employees understand what actions are improper and what behavior crosses the line to harassment.Many employees may believe that only supervisors or others in a position of authority can be guilty of harassment, but this is untrue. Co-workers can harass each other, and in some cases an employee could even be on the hook for harassing someone who doesn't work for you, such as a vendor or a customer.Your policy should make clear that any examples or descriptions of harassment provided are not exhaustive. If a statement or action by an employee makes someone else feel uncomfortable, it should be treated as harassment.Explain to your employees that if they have questions about certain conduct, or doubts about whether it would be appropriate, they should err on the side of caution and assume the behavior should be kept out of the workplace.
Your employees also should understand that their intention is irrelevant to whether they are engaging in harassment. If the person who is the target of the words or actions feels harassed, the words or activity constitute harassment. It doesn't matter if those words or acts were meant to be a joke.

, Employees who have been harassed should have a good understanding of exactly what they must do to have their concerns addressed.Your policy should be simple and straightforward.Employees will be less likely to file complaints if it looks as though they'll have to cut through a bunch of red tape to have their concerns heard.
List specific employees in charge of handling harassment complaints, but also stress that employees can go to any supervisor or manager if they are being harassed.
In addition to describing the procedure for handling and investigating complaints, provide options that may be available to an employee who is experiencing harassment. These options should be designed to alleviate the problem and prevent any further damage while the complaint is being investigated. For example, you might separate the employees involved by putting them on different shifts or having them work in different departments.

, Your consequences should be realistic and should be applied uniformly.Make sure you include similar consequences for acts of retaliation against employees who file complaints, and against employees who file false or frivolous harassment complaints out of spite or a desire for retribution.Your disciplinary sanctions should escalate and include termination for egregious or repeated offenses.Make it clear that no sanctions will be imposed without a full investigation that uncovers clear evidence of harassment.

, From their first day, your employees should have a good understanding of the type of behavior that isn't acceptable in the workplace.


Written policy handbooks can provide a general awareness of workplace harassment and understanding of how inappropriate behavior is handled in your company.
Although you can and should make it clear that illegal harassment isn't tolerated in the workplace, you also should include a clear statement that any sort of harassing behavior is unproductive, unprofessional, and inappropriate in the workplace environment., Continuing education and training keeps your employees up-to-date on any changes to the policy and increases attention to workplace harassment.


Harassment training seminars should be conducted at least once a year, and in some states this training is required by law. For example, California requires all employers with more than 50 employees to provide two hours of interactive sexual harassment training every two years.Train supervisors and managers in how to recognize harassment and how to handle this type of behavior, even if no complaint is filed., If you want to avoid workplace harassment lawsuits, you can't assume that your company is free of harassment because no one has complained.Look around the workplace and take note of any offensive notes, signs, or posters you see.You can talk to the employee responsible for them before they potentially become a problem. For example, you may have an employee who has a swimsuit calendar on the wall above his desk. Understanding that a female employee may take offense to this calendar, you can ask the employee to take it down rather than displaying it prominently.

, The EEOC has pamphlets, signs, and other materials that can help educate your employees on the dangers of workplace harassment.


You can download and print these materials yourself at http://www1.eeoc.gov/eeoc/publications/index.cfm, or you can order pre-printed materials free of charge from the government agency.Making materials readily available keeps the issue of workplace harassment out in the open, lessening the likelihood that employees will be afraid to file a complaint because of fear or intimidation.

, Since reporting harassment can be a sensitive subject, you should ensure employees can talk to someone with whom they feel comfortable.


You also may want to designate someone outside the company to take and investigate complaints. Even if he or she is never contacted, this sends a message to your employees that no one is exempt from the policy, and harassment isn't tolerated from anyone at any level of the company.

, Even though you may view a particular complaint as trivial or frivolous, treat it the same as you would any other.Keep in mind a full-blown investigation won't be necessary for every situation that gets reported. However, taking the complaint seriously from the beginning ensures the problem can be resolved quickly and efficiently.Maintain objectivity when dealing with complaints. If you or the person handling the complaint feels he or she cannot be objective because they are close to the person accused of harassment, the complaint should be handed off to someone else who can remain neutral., Employees need to know that to the extent possible, their identities and the details of their harassment complaints will not be disclosed.


Details about a harassment complaint should only be shared with others when absolutely necessary to help resolve the problem. You should strive to protect the anonymity of harassed employees in particular to every extent possible.If specifics about harassment complaints become the fodder for gossip around the workplace, you may open yourself up to a lawsuit for a hostile work environment., Employees will not believe you are taking their complaints seriously unless you investigate them and attempt to resolve them as quickly as possible.Investigating complaints thoroughly and efficiently can be the best way to avoid workplace harassment lawsuits.Even if the issue is not resolved 100 percent to the harassed employee's satisfaction, he or she will be less likely to file a lawsuit if you took the complaint seriously and handled it immediately.
In contrast, delaying or dragging your feet on an investigation can make it look like you're trying to sweep the situation under the rug.
Make sure you're investigating all complaints, regardless of the reputation of the employee who made the complaint or the relationship between the complaining employee and the employee alleged to have harassed him or her.
For example, you may get a harassment complaint from an employee with a reputation for complaining about everything and having a generally poor attitude. Treat this complaint the same way you would one that came from your most reliable and productive employee.

, In the event an employee does file a report with the EEOC or with a state agency, you must have written documentation of the steps you took to resolve the situation.Keep a single file for each complaint, beginning with a log sheet that lists the dates of each step taken on the matter from the filing of the complaint to each resolution.If there are any documents related to the complaint, such as email exchanges or particular photos or posters an employee has indicated made him or her uncomfortable, include these items or copies of them in the same file with the original complaint.If you interview an employee face-to-face, record the interview or take written notes. Have the employee review any written notes before you add them to the file and confirm they are accurate., Your anti-harassment policy won't be very valuable if you don't enforce it the same way every time, with every employee.


You must hold all employees to the same standard, regardless of their rank or role in the company. If certain behavior would be inappropriate for your lowliest wage-earning employee, it is equally inappropriate for an executive or general manager.Bending the rules or allowing an exception for any employee, for any reason, can open you up to claims of unfair treatment, which could form the basis of a workplace harassment lawsuit.After you've resolved the situation and disciplined any employees as dictated by the policy, follow up with the employee who was victimized to make sure the conduct has ceased and the employee is no longer being targeted."

Initiate a casual conversation with your colleague.,
Ask if they’ve had any difficulties in the workplace recently.,
Let them know you’re having trouble focusing.,
Explain that it's not their fault.,
Agree on a signal for too much noise.,
Thank them and end positively.",How to Ask a Colleague to Stop Making So Much Noise1," Try to start the conversation in a positive way. You can talk about shared interests, or your life outside of work. Be friendly, and avoid seeming frustrated.Asking them about their life shows you’re interested in them as a person. You can say something like, “How was your weekend? Did you get to spend some time with your family?”
You can let them know how you’re doing. This can also be a way to introduce the idea that you’re having a hard time focusing. You can say, “I finally got some rest this weekend. I’m hoping that will help me have more energy and focus this week.”;
, Before you assume that they’re the one causing all the problems for you, find out how things have been for them. You may learn that they’re having a hard time focusing, or have been frustrated by something you’re doing.Really listen to your colleague’s answer and consider what you can do to help make their working environment better. For example, they may be making a lot of noise to block out the sound from another department. In that case, the two of you could approach that department together.
It’s possible they haven’t had any difficulties in the workplace. They may just not realize that their noise is disturbing.

, Avoid sounding like you’re complaining. Focus on the ways that their noise is preventing you from being productive in the workplace. Make sure they know that this isn’t just about your personal preference, it’s about your ability to do your job. You can say something like, “I can tell that listening to music doesn’t bother you while you’re working, but I have a hard time focusing when there’s music on. And I hear your music very loudly at my desk.”
Be honest without expressing judgement. For example, instead of saying, “You shouldn’t be taking loud personal calls while you’re on the clock,” you could say, “I’ve overheard a lot of the personal calls you’ve made lately. I don’t want to feel like I’m eavesdropping, but it’s actually hard for me to tune it out, because of your volume.”

, You don't want to make your coworker feel awkward or embarrassed, since you have to see them everyday. Make sure they know that it's not personal. Point out ways that external factors contribute to your difficulty with the noise.


You can blame the situation on your own difficulty focusing, on the office acoustics or cramped quarters, or anything else in order to avoid blaming the person or making them feel as if you think they are inconsiderate.
You can say something like, ""I know it's not your fault. The walls here are ridiculously thin. But that ends up meaning I can hear everything you're doing in your office.""

, A signal is a great tool for keeping the dialog around noise open. This way, you’re not telling your colleague that they must be absolutely silent at all times. Instead, you’re creating a way that they can learn to gauge when they’ve gotten too loud.If your work setup is such that you can see each other, you can use a hand signal, such as thumbs down, waving, or pointing to your ears.
If you can’t see each other, but have phones or computers handy, you can send a text or message simply saying, “volume” or “shhh.” Be sure to agree on the text of the message ahead of time, so your brief messages don’t come off as rude.

, This helps them know that the conversation wasn’t personal. Let them know you appreciate them helping to create a healthy and happy working environment for you. Offer to help in the future if they have any issues with the workplace themselves.You can say something like, “Thanks so much for being flexible. I really appreciate being able to work alongside someone as considerate as you.""
Let them know that you can also be flexible. Say, “And of course, if there’s anything I can do to make a better workplace for you, I hope you’ll let me know.”

However, it’s possible that you might just have something personal against this particular coworker. Alternately, you may have unrealistic expectations of workplace behavior.Choose another coworker whom you trust. Ask them if they’ve noticed the noise or find it disturbing. If you mention the name of the noisy coworker, be sure that your friend won’t mention it to them without your permission, or that they won’t spread rumors or report it to the boss.
If your friend disagrees with you about the noise being a problem, you may want to consider finding your own way of dealing with it. For example, if you work in a kitchen or a garage where there’s lots of noise, you might want to wear earplugs or listen to music with headphones.

, If you don’t want to approach one other coworker for their opinion, you could take a poll of your entire workplace. Create a survey and post it somewhere prominent where everyone can see it and weigh in.You can make your survey an online one, if that’s appropriate to your workplace, or you can hang one in the breakroom or put it in coworkers’ mailboxes.
To keep things positive also allow people to remark on things they love or enjoy about the workplace.
A survey could say something like, ""Please list two things you love about working here and two things we could do to make it better.""

, Once people have had a chance to weigh in, share the survey results with the rest of your coworkers. You can do this online or you can propose an informal meeting to discuss the results and figure out what you can all do to improve your working environment.It’s possible that the survey results won’t reflect your personal interests. For example, you may be the only person who takes issue with the noise, but multiple people may complain about your or someone else’s choice of perfume or air freshener. Be prepared to follow through on the discussion, even if others don’t share your concerns.
Even if you’re the only one who objects to the noise, it’s still a valid concern. Bring it up in the meeting, along with others’ concerns.
Avoid calling out specific coworkers in a meeting or other public forum. This can be embarrassing for them. Establish workplace guidelines and expectations and assume that your noisy colleague will take responsibility for themselves.

, If you’ve decided to create a workplace discussion, you’ve likely excluded your manager or boss from the discussion. That can be good, as it gives you and your coworkers agency in addressing workplace concerns.In some workplaces, you might have enough autonomy to organize this without talking to your boss. If not, check in with them before taking this on.
Draft a list of expectations or best practices and post it somewhere prominent. Create a small committee to do this together, so that it doesn’t seem like you’re controlling the process.
If possible, designate some space in your workplace as “quiet space.” This can mean space where there’s no talking on cell phones, no music, or no use of machinery.
If your noisy colleague fails to abide by the new guidelines, you can pull them aside and remind them.

Try talking to your colleague first.,
Find a time to meet with your boss.,
Ask for a change in location or shift.",How to Ask a Colleague to Stop Making So Much Noise3," Never go directly to your manager without first approaching your colleague. Part of a manager’s job is certainly to manage morale and conflict, but they should never be the first line of defense.Be kind when approaching your colleague. Don’t begin the conversation with complaints or threats. You can say something like, “I’m not sure if you realize this, but I can hear you all the way over at my desk. Would it be possible for you to be quieter?”
If your colleague won’t agree to be quieter, or if they don’t follow through, talk to the manager. You may choose to let your colleague know that you’ll be doing that, but it’s not necessary. You can say something like, “I’d really like to resolve this without bringing our manager into the conversation, if possible.""

, You may want to send them an e-mail or leave them a note letting them know that you’d like to talk. Ask to schedule a short, private meeting with them. You can let them know what it’s about, but don’t mention your noisy coworker by name.Try to avoid naming your noisy coworker to your boss. This shows that you’re not trying to get them in trouble or personally attack them. However, if your boss asks who it is, be honest.
Let your boss know that you’re concerned about your own productivity, not just annoyed at your coworker. You can say something like, “I don’t usually have a difficult time focusing, but since Joe has started working in my department, I haven’t been able to concentrate because of the noise. He does a great job, it’s just hard to hear myself think.”

, It’s possible that you may be able to move your desk or work a different shift from your noisy colleague. This may end up benefiting everyone, depending on how things work out. Changing shifts may be a good strategy. For example, restaurants can be noisy places to work. If your loud colleague works the dinner shift, try switching to work breakfast, when it’s quieter.
If your noisy colleague works in one area of the office, see if you can be transferred to another space that is known to be quieter.

Assess the legitimacy of your termination.Why were you fired in the first place?,
Seek legal counsel if necessary.If your employer fired you for an illegitimate reason--even if legitimate reasons were part of the termination--you may want to consult a lawyer.,
Revise your résumé or vitae.Update your résumé or vitae with your most recent job.,
Reach out to your previous employer to determine if rehiring is a possibility.,
Resolve any issue that may have caused your termination.,
Prepare for questions regarding your departure and time away.Have responses in place to likely questions such as ""Why should we take you back?,
Submit a new application for employment.",How to Ask for Your Job Back1," Did you do something you were not supposed to do? Was it something avoidable? Did your boss or another employee have it out for you and set you up to be fired? There are a number of ways your termination could have been the appropriate response to bad behavior. It could also have been caused by an inappropriate reaction.


If you know that there have been negative rumors spread about you in the office regarding protected statuses (e.g., religion, sexual orientation, or age) this is a good place to start. You may want to find out of others like yourself have lost their jobs too. If there's a pattern of discrimination, you may have a good case to get your job back.;
, You may be able to show your termination was not justified. This may effectively void your termination. If you are in a union or are under contract, you may need to do this immediately so that your lawyer(s) can negotiate your rehire.

, Highlight the valuable contributions you made to the company before your termination. This helps show you were a valuable member of the team before you were fired. Take time to polish up the wording to make yourself look as good as possible without overdoing it. You want to remind them of the work you did and why they hired you in the first place.

, This can be tricky depending on the circumstances of your termination. If you are eligible for rehire they may give you a list of requirements you must meet to get your job back. If they give you a list, do it. Even if they say you cannot have your job back, you may ask to take a reduction in pay or a lesser job in hopes of reattaining your former status over time. If they flat out refuse to allow you back, do not take this as fact just yet.


One way to do this is to have lunch or dinner with an old co-worker in your office. Your old boss works too if you left on good terms. You may be able to discuss open positions at the company. They may be able to tell you if the climate is good for you to re-apply.

, If you have any personal issues, especially if they were explicit causes for your termination, work on them now. You need to have these resolved before you ask for your job back. Furthermore, you have plenty of time to resolve these issues while you are unemployed.


If you were let go because of your behavior, seek counseling. You may have an unknown condition that needs to be medicated. If you know you have some disorder and are avoiding treatment, get treatment now. If your bad behavior is the only issue, try to work through it with a counselor.

,"", ""Why do you want to work here again?"", and ""How would you feel about doing a different/lower level position from before?"". Be humble in your responses. You want to show them whatever issues existed in the past are no longer an issue.


Emphasize that your experience at the job make you a good candidate for rehire. Experience and know-how are valuable qualities no matter what other factors are in play. Even if your performance was poor at the end, highlight the work you did when they appreciated your skills.
If the conditions under which you left were circumstantial, for instance a problem in your personal life, it is appropriate to mention that. A change in those circumstances would partially explain the value of your returning to the company.
Avoid being defensive regarding the cause of your termination. You are not there to re-litigate the past. Try to shift conversations about the past into a discussion about how you can help the company in the future.

, Even if they are not explicitly hiring, go ahead and submit a new application. Include your revised résumé or vitae. This way they have the application on file if they need it or chose to disregard you. If you want your job back you must reapply or your old employer could refuse to hire you simply because you didn't apply.

Meet the criteria for unemployment insurance.,
Understand the base period.,
Gather the necessary information and documents.,
Apply for unemployment online.,
Call the unemployment office directly.,
Calculate your average weekly wage from the base period.,
Compute 50% of your average weekly wage.,
Factor in the number of dependents you have.,
Multiply the weekly amount by your number of qualifying weeks.",How to Calculate Amount of Unemployment in Ohio," There are a certain number of factors that determine whether or not you are eligible for unemployment compensation. If the following applies to you, then you are considered unemployed and are eligible for unemployment insurance and benefits.You are totally or partially unemployed at the time you file for unemployment. If you performed no services and received no pay for the entire week before you filed, then you are totally unemployed. If you lost your job before the end of a typical work week or had your hours reduced and are earning less than the weekly unemployment benefit, then you are partially unemployed.
You must have worked a minimum of 20 weeks during the previous base period to be considered unemployed.
A base period in Ohio consists of the past 4 quarters of three months each, not including the current one.You must have earned at least $237 per week during the base period.
You must be unemployed through no fault of your own. For example, if you were laid off or fired unreasonably, you lost your job through no fault of your own. If, however, you were fired for fighting with your boss or coworkers, you are considered to have caused your own termination.
Quitting your job is also covered if you quit for good reason. Ohio considers ""good reason"" to be: 1)Your employer failed to meet the terms of the employment agreement. 2) Your employer failed to provide proper safety measures required by law. 3) Your work violated accepted moral or legal standards. It is up to you to prove that you quit for one of these reasons.;
, Unemployment insurance uses base periods to determine if you are eligible for benefits. In Ohio, the year is divided into 4 quarters of 3 three months each. The base period is the last 4 quarters that have gone by, not counting the current one.As of 2015, if you worked at least 20 weeks and earned more than $237 per week during the past 52 weeks and lose your job, you qualify for unemployment benefits.
Your specific base period depends on when you are filing your claim. Use this table to determine what your base period is.
Weeks you work during the base period are called qualifying weeks.

, When filing for unemployment, you will have to provide several pieces of information. Have all of this at hand when you file to make the process go by smoother.Your Social Security number.
Your driver's license or state ID number.
Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address.
Name, address, telephone number, and dates of employment with each employer you worked for during the past 6 weeks.
The reason you became unemployed from each employer.
Dependents' names, Social Security numbers, and dates of birth.
If claiming dependents, your spouse's name, Social Security number, and birth date.
If you are not a U.S. citizen or national, alien registration number and expiration date.
Your regular occupation and job skills.
If you had out of state employment, federal employment, or military employment, you may also have to provide Form DD-214, member 4 copy (for military service) and SF-8 or SF-50 form (for federal government employment).

, Ohio uses an online system for filing for unemployment. You can access the application here. The application is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

, If you don't have access to a computer or prefer to use the phone, you can alternatively file for unemployment by calling 1-877-644-6562 or TTY 1-888-642-8203. The office is open from 8-5, Monday through Friday., Your unemployment compensation is based on your average wage during past employment. There is a simple process to calculating your average wage.Add up all of your earnings from the base period. If you worked multiple jobs, include all of them in this calculation.
Divide the total wages by the number of weeks you worked. So if your total wages were $30,000 and you worked 25 weeks, your average weekly wage is $1,200.

, Your weekly unemployment compensation will either be 50% of your weekly wage or a maximum number based on the number of dependents you have, whichever is lower.To do this, just divide your average weekly wage by 2. So if your average wage was $1,200, this would be $600.

, Based on your average weekly income and the number of dependents you have, the state of Ohio assigns a weekly amount that you will receive for unemployment compensation.As of 2015, there are 3 dependency categories. Category A means you have no dependents. Category B means that you have 1 or 2 dependents. Category C means that you have 3 or more dependents.
The 2015 maximum amounts are as follows: Category A is $424, Category B is $514, and Category C is $572. This is the most you will receive per week in unemployment compensation.Compare the weekly maximum to 50% of your average weekly wage. If the wage is less than the weekly maximum, then you will receive 50% of your average weekly wage. If it is more, then you'll receive the weekly maximum.

, The number of qualifying weeks is how long your payments will last. Once you determine a weekly maximum, then you can multiply it by the number of qualifying weeks to determine what your total payout will be.If you're in Category B, then your maximum payout is $514. If you have 30 qualifying weeks, then your total payout will be $15,420.
If your weekly allowance gets reduced for any reason, your total payout remains the same. It will then take longer for your benefits to run out.

Work hard.,
Pay attention to your appearance.,
Don’t involve yourself romantically with coworkers.,
Act respectably outside of work.",How to Avoid Being the Subject of Workplace Gossip1," If you do a great job and earn respect from your workplace peers, they will be less likely to gossip about you. Always pull your weight at work, and don’t slack off. Go the extra mile on projects and presentations. Pitch in to help your peers when they need assistance. The social capital you accumulate will discourage your coworkers from turning you into the subject of gossip., If you come in to work with yogurt or crumbs all over your shirt, you might attract the negative attention of the rumor mill. Likewise, if your pants are constantly wrinkled, your face unshaven, and your hair unkempt and wild, you could become the subject of workplace gossip.Dress appropriately if you are allowed to select your own mode of dress. Inquire with your human resources department about what the appropriate work attire is for your workplace.

, Having a fling with a coworker is a bad idea for lots of reasons. Not only could you end up getting fired (if such a relationship violates your workplace’s code of conduct), but you might also end up in an awkward position if the relationship ends and you have to see your ex every day at work. On top of that, of course, you also run the risk of becoming the subject of workplace gossip. Even if you and your coworker make a big effort to keep your work and private lives separate, you might end up giving away too much through small gestures like a wink or too much time spent conversing with your lover instead of working.

, You might think that your behavior outside of work is nobody’s business. Indeed, if you’re not on the clock, you can do whatever you want. But if you live in a small town, things you do or say might get back to your coworkers who know your neighbors, mutual friends, and other community members. Take care to treat everyone with respect and kindness to avoid becoming the subject of workplace gossip."

Resolve your own issues first.,
Apologize to your previous employer and boss if needed.Unless you left for a legitimate reason (e.g., moving away for college), by now you are thinking that something has changed between when you quit and now.,
Revise your résumé or curriculum vitae.Anytime you leave a job you should revise your résumé or vitae.,
Submit your updated résumé or vitae to your previous employer.,
Be prepared to answer questions about why you quit.Try to focus on your own change as a person rather than negative aspects of your job.,
Humble yourself before your boss.",How to Ask for Your Job Back2," If you quit there was likely a reason. Even if you think your boss was at fault, if you want your job back you will have to submit to them. You need to focus on your own attitude and desires. How can you adapt your attitude to be accepting of a future working in the company you just quit?


If you go into a program and successfully complete it, be sure to inform your former employer of your success. This shows maturity and growth.

, Apologize to your previous employer and boss letting them know you regret your decision. That your attitude has changed and you have realized your mistake. If there were hard feelings, ask your employer to forgive your bad behavior and reassure them that you have changed. If they hire your back, they can depend on you long term.


Try to make your apology sincere by doing so in the most thoughtful way possible. Avoid apologizing by text or email. You should apologize face-to-face if possible. By phone if not. If you get their voicemail, ask for a call back or let them know you will call back. Do not apologize by voicemail.
In your apology, admit fault and responsibility. Be sincere and let them know you know you made a mistake. If you said anything inappropriate, be sure to note you are sorry about that too. Don't be clever. ""I'm sorry, I was wrong"" shows strength of character.

, Go ahead and do this so you can resubmit it in the future. Take time to polish it so it looks remarkable. You want to show your previous employer you can act professionally.

, Go ahead and submit your résumé or vitae to your previous employer even if they are not hiring. You may decide to use your internal contacts to forward your résumé or vitae to the right person.


When you submit your updated materials, do so widely. Give them to the hiring personnel as well as your former boss. You may want to let other managers you were on good terms with know you are looking for work again. This way you follow the proper procedures by filing with the hiring people and you can get others interested in hiring you.

, The goal here is to show you are reliable. Even if you were not reliable in the past you can highlight your past mistakes and how you have resolved them. You are more reliable now than before because you resolved your issues.

, Your boss or employer may be amicable to your return pending some sort of penance. They may accept you back at lower pay or in a different, less desirable position. If you want your job back, accept their conditions but emphasize you want your old job back. Then you can show them how serious you are about reacquiring your old job. This will give you time to re-earn their respect.


Don't allow yourself to be demeaned too much. Taking a lower position or a drop in pay is one thing. Being harassed or bad mouthed in the office is different and is unacceptable.

Protect your employment status.When you get rehired you may want to remember you were previously laid off from that job.",How to Ask for Your Job Back3," You'll need to keep in contact with your former co-workers to see if work is picking up or getting too much to handle. You may even want to let your former boss know you're still available if they decide to hire another person.


If you knew your boss or co-workers well, try to keep in touch outside of work. Have lunch or dinner with them. Join them for birthday parties or cookouts. You may want to have a social event and invite them to join you.

, Use your time off to refresh and polish the document. Take time with your job summary to highlight the important work you performed. Emphasize the skills you gained from working at the company and what you have learned since.

, People trust those that they know. They know they can rely on you if additional help is required. Go ahead and find people willing to vouch for you when business picks up again. Go ahead and ask them to permit you to include them on your list of references.


Co-workers are great references. Your boss or other managers and supervisors are better though. Their word means more to hiring personnel. Be careful to only use those references that you know will be positive though. Better to have co-workers who like you than a manager that barely tolerates you.

, They may not be hiring but they will know you are serious about working for you again. If they need you your updated documentation will be on file. Hopefully they will be in touch soon.

, Pay close attention to new trends and projects your former co-workers tell you about. If work suddenly picks up they may call you hoping you are available almost immediately. This saves them a lot of time and money forgoing an extensive job search.


Whenever you hear of a new process or procedure being started at your old employer, take time to read up on it. If you are close with your co-workers, ask them about what's going on. You want to stay as up-to-date as you can so that you can demonstrate skill and proficiency if asked to work again.

, What happens if business slows down again? You may want to discuss an employment contract requiring the company to keep you on for at least a year. At the very least you can ask that your previous time working for the company be considered part of your history. In other words, you retain some seniority in the company despite being only recently rehired.

Stick to the correct topics when talking with coworkers.,
Maintain a positive attitude at work.,
Don’t gossip about others.,
Avoid sharing personal information.,
Don’t use social media.",How to Avoid Being the Subject of Workplace Gossip2," Instead of talking to your coworkers about your family life, political activities, or personal problems, talk to them about sports or your favorite television shows. Gossiping about these subjects can actually improve workplace camaraderie.Even neutral topics like workplace news should be generally avoided. For instance, if you have a piece of info about someone in your company, or a new product line, that information might be for your eyes and ears only.
Never talk negatively about your workplace superiors.
Avoid talking to your coworkers about anything controversial.

, If you seem depressed and blue all the time, your coworkers might begin to spin stories about what’s wrong with you. Likewise, if you have a short temper and blow up over the littlest things all the time, you could mark yourself as a target for workplace gossip. Keep on an even keel, even when things don’t go your way.It’s okay to feel angry or sad when something frustrating happens, whether it’s in or out of work. But when you punch the clock, leave your baggage at the door. Focus on your job, and push your personal problems out of your mind.
Be friendly, but not invasive, with your coworkers. Ask them how their day is. Remark upon the weather.
For instance, you might say “It’s beautiful out today” if the weather is nice, or “It’s nasty out today” if the day is rainy and gray.
Smile frequently to show your coworkers you are in a good mood.

, If you gossip about your coworkers all the time, they might get their revenge by gossiping about you. Prevent this vicious cycle of gossip and retaliation by keeping gossip and negative comments to yourself.If you have a real problem or issue with someone in your workplace, confront them directly. Say to them, “Could I speak to you privately for a moment?”
When you and the person you’re interested in speaking with are alone, address your concerns to them.
When you’re done talking, say, “Let’s just keep this between us” so that neither of you will discuss the issue with others, thus preventing potential gossip.

, It’s okay to share some basic details about yourself. For instance, you might share the fact that you are or are not married, or whether or not you have kids. But if you share sensitive personal information with your coworkers, they might use it against you later. The best way to insulate yourself from becoming the subject of workplace gossip is to ensure that nobody at your workplace has any information they could leverage to churn out hurtful gossip against you. For instance, never share information pertaining to your:sexual activity
immigration status
illegal behavior
illnesses or medical conditions
conflicts with your kids or partner

, Many rumor mills churn out gossip based on a compromising image you posted online. Posts about your job or personal life are also fodder for workplace gossips. To limit your likelihood of becoming the subject of workplace gossip, stay off social media.Alternately, you could use social media with great caution. Only add friends who don’t work with you, and maintain the highest level of privacy on everything you post, and don’t share content frequently. Before posting, think about what your boss or coworkers might say if they saw the content.
Remember not to post anything to a friend’s page, since your friend’s page might have a lower level of privacy and could be accessible to coworkers.

Evaluate the gossip objectively.,
Try to understand the gossiper.,
Think about how to respond.",How to Avoid Being the Subject of Workplace Gossip3," Sometimes workplace gossip is true, or contains some kernel of truth. Nobody likes being criticized, but you should be honest with yourself when thinking through critical gossip from others.If you decide that the gossip has some merit, work to correct whatever fault inspired it.
If your coworkers are gossiping that you are not doing a good job, for instance, take their criticism into serious consideration and evaluate your performance. If you decide that you could be doing a better job, start working harder and help your peers out more often.

, People who gossip about others often do so not because they detect something unbecoming in others, but because they are uncomfortable with themselves. Gossip becomes a tool through which they attempt to deflect negative attention away from themselves while attracting positive attention. Understanding this will help you see the gossiper for what they truly are: a sad and desperate individual struggling with their own insecurity.Remember, understanding the gossiper’s motivation doesn’t mean you need to excuse it.

, There are several ways to respond when you become the subject of workplace gossip. The best thing to do if you know who is behind the gossip is to confront the person directly. Perhaps they didn’t anticipate how hurtful their gossiping could be, and will work to rectify the situation after you explain how hurt you are.You could say, “I’m very hurt by the gossip you’ve perpetuated about me. Will you please retract what you said so that others recognize that it was merely gossip?”
In other cases, where you suspect the gossiper is unrepentant, you should contact your superior or your human resources department in order to lodge a complaint about the situation.
Sometimes, it’s best to let the gossiper just wear themselves out. If they see that they aren’t getting a rise out of you, they’re liable to quit gossiping after a bit. And if others merely roll their eyes at the discredited gossip, it’s best to pay them no mind.
You could also talk openly about the subject of gossip, thus rendering the issue unworthy for gossip.
Never launch a counterattack against the person or people who spread the gossip with gossip of your own.
Analyze the situation carefully when charting a course for responding to gossip.Recognize that you cannot change the gossiper. You can only change your response to the gossip.

Control your negative emotions.,
Adjust your point of view.,
Be compassionate with yourself.,
Focus on the positive.,
Seek support.",How to Avoid Being the Subject of Workplace Gossip4," Controlling your negative emotions doesn’t mean you ignore or avoid your feelings of anger or sadness. On the contrary, you should directly acknowledge and confront your feelings. But you must channel your negative emotions into constructive, nonaggressive outlets.If you feel negative emotions while at work, make an effort to smile and be gracious to those around you, especially the person who gossiped about you.
Try deep breathing exercises. For instance, close your eyes, breathe in slowly for three seconds, then breathe out through your mouth for five seconds.
If you need to take a break, head out for a snack or a brisk walk around your workplace.
If you feel angry when you’re at home, you could play loud rock ‘n roll music with your band.
You might also go for a run if you feel angry or frustrated with a coworker.

, If you are angry, hurt, or ashamed by the gossip, you’ll feel powerless. But you can regain your sense of self-confidence by stepping back from the situation and looking at it clinically.For instance, remind yourself that the gossip is just idle talk with little to no basis in fact.
Remind yourself that despite the fact that you’re the subject of workplace gossip, you’re a winner and you always do a great job.

, It’s important to practice self-care after becoming the subject of workplace gossip. This means not blaming yourself for the gossip. Remember that nothing you did or didn’t do qualified you to deserve becoming the subject of workplace gossip.If you are ashamed, forgive yourself. Say, “I am a good person and I don’t deserve to be the subject of workplace gossip.”
Take some time to relax and do things you enjoy. For instance, you might take extra time out of your day to read a book or watch your favorite film.
Going to the spa or massage therapist is also a great way to relieve the stress that accompanies becoming the subject of workplace gossip.

, Even while it’s hard to stay upbeat when you’re the subject of workplace gossip, think about the positive things in your personal and professional lives. For instance, you might reflect on how excited you are to go home to your spouse or child, or drive the new car you just bought. When thinking about your professional life, take the long view – think of all the great accolades and accomplishments you’ve received at work, and how many more you’re sure to rack up in the future., Share your concerns about being the subject of workplace gossip with friends and family who care about you. Express to them how frustrated you are by the gossip. Listen as the empathize with you and shar their own stories about being the subject of workplace gossip. Use your conversations with loving friends and family to remember that despite being the subject of workplace gossip, you’re not alone."

You know when you’ll wake up, go to work, take a lunch break, and go home. While it may be tempting to binge watch television shows all day while unemployed, this can quickly turn into a bad habit. Having a routine can help you accomplish your goals, complete chores, and get things done.Your routine doesn’t have to mimic your job hours but find a routine that can help you get things done throughout the day.;
, For example, you may want to shower and work on job applications daily and do your laundry and vacuum weekly. Estimate how long each task will take and put your different tasks on your schedule.It may take some trial and error to figure out a realistic schedule. You may want to accomplish fifteen things in one day but realize you can more likely accomplish six.
A sample schedule might look like:

8am – 9am: Shower and eat breakfast
9am – 11am: Work on job applications
11:30am: Lunch meeting with recruiter
2pm – 3:30pm: Attend job fair
4pm – 5pm: Gym
6pm: Dinner
10pm: Get ready for bed



, Do certain things every day. For example, wake up each morning, shower, and change into new clothes. While you may be tempted to lounge around in the same clothes every day or minimize your hygiene habits, keep certain habits consistent, even if you’re staying in all day.


Don’t “let yourself go.” Take care of yourself and attend to your care everyday.

, Take some time to relax and socialize with friends and put this in your schedule.While you want to create a schedule to keep yourself motivated and on task, your life doesn’t have to be boring or all about getting another job.


After you complete a big task (say, applying for new jobs), take a 30-minute break and do something you enjoy. Watch television, call a friend, play with your dog, or go for a walk.

, Even if it’s tempting to eat pasta for every meal, spend time preparing your meals. Take the opportunity to try recipes you haven’t gotten around to and to eat new cuisines. Eating healthy foods can help power your body with energy, prevent mood swings, and fight against depression.If you already struggle with depression, making healthy choices in food can help you manage your symptoms.


Spend time preparing your own meals and not eating out much. Add fruits and vegetables to your diet and balance your meals with protein and grains. Consume minimal amounts of sugar.
For some more tips, check out How to Eat Healthy.

, Physical activity has many benefits for you. It helps to strengthen your bones and muscles, lower your risk of certain diseases, and improve your mental health and mood.If you don’t enjoy exercise, it’s likely there’s an active activity that you may enjoy. For example, try swing dancing or salsa dancing, or give indoor rock climbing a go. Instead of going on a walk, go for a hike. You can even volunteer at an animal shelter and take the dogs on a walk.


Aim to exercise 150 minutes per week with moderate exercise., If you’re feeling depressed about losing your job, don’t turn to alcohol. Alcohol and depression can create a vicious cycle where one perpetuates the other.If you feel depressed, consider seeing a therapist. You can learn skills and begin to change your negative thought patterns to better cope with feelings of depression.


You may want to turn to drinking out of boredom or to have something to do, but focus on healthy habits instead.

, Manage stress by engaging in relaxation. Keep your stress levels low by practicing relaxation for 30 minutes each day. Relaxation has physical and emotional health benefits such as helping you cope with depression and helping you stabilize your moods.Do exercises that relax and calm you. Try daily yoga, qigong, tai chi, and meditation. If one doesn’t work, try a different method.

, While you may be tempted to oversleep, make sure you get enough sleep to function well throughout the day. Likewise, don’t stay up all night partying or drinking and not rest much. To stay healthy, aim to get seven to nine hours of sleep each night.You should wake up feeling rested.


If you’re experiencing changes with your sleep (such as sleeping too much or too little), this may be a symptom of depression. Check out How to Know if You Have Depression for more information.

, Encourage yourself to make an effort each day to apply for jobs. Have a set number of applications you want to send out each day. Reach out to people in your network — former co-workers, friends, family, and acquaintances — for leads. Scour the internet or your local job listing to find places that appeal to you. Create “work hours” for you to find available jobs and send your resume out. For example, set time aside between 11am – 3pm to work on job applications. If you receive unemployment, you are likely required to spend a certain number of hours looking for jobs each week.Work hard on improving and updating your resume so that you feel confident sending it out.

, If you tend to spend money without giving much thought, you may need to adjust your spending while you are unemployed. Find ways to cut down on expenses. For example, lots of people spend more money than they realize on eating out and alcohol. Cut back on your weekly dinners or “It’s 5 o’clock somewhere” drinks. Choose to walk or ride your bike places you used to drive. Renegotiate your cell phone bill and sort through your bills.Find your money leaks and patch them. Consider using a cash-only system.

, While it may be tempting to sit in front of the television all day, watch movies on your computer, or play video games all day, set some limits. Too much screen time can have a negative impact on your physical and emotional health.Set limits on your screen time by watching one TV show at a time, limiting your internet browsing and cell phone usage. Set an actual timer to notify you when you've reached your limit so you don't lose track of time.


Choose to reward yourself with screen time after accomplishing a goal, such as sending out job applications.
Decide to visit social media sites one to three times per day, for a set amount of time, instead of checking in repeatedly over the course of the day.

, You will have much more free time when you are unemployed, and a productive way to use some of this time is by thinking about what you want for your life and from your next job. Work on identifying your values, setting goals, and exploring interests you may not have had time for while you were working. You may find that you actually want to make a career change, or that you want a position in the same field but with less stress. This is a good time to get to know what makes you happy and what truly interests you.

, If you’re feeling sad about losing your job, don’t isolate yourself and stay away from people. You may feel embarrassed or even ashamed, but it’s no reason to be on your own. Isolation can contribute to mental health problems such as depression and anxiety.Instead, surround yourself with people who care about you. Spend time with family, meet up with friends, and maintain an active social life. Having good friends in your life can help buffer stress and increase feelings of support.Avoid getting together in environments that may cause you to slip back into bad habits. Get together for tea or to watch a movie together.

, Think about what habits you may have and be aware that they may creep up on you during this period. Stress often brings habits and addictions to the fore. If you used to smoke but quit, know that it may be possible to revert back to smoking once you are unemployed. Bring your awareness to the habits you tend to gravitate toward.Write them down or ask other people who are close to you.


For example, you may not take care of yourself or your home (for example, not showering or not doing your dishes), revert to unhealthy meals (like only eating cereal all day), binge watch television shows, or start drinking alcohol more frequently. Know what you’re prone to do so that you can plan a defense.

, What situations put you at risk to go back? Think about when you feel vulnerable in your habits.


For example, you may watch television when you are bored or trying to escape life. Or you may stop taking care of yourself because you can’t face yourself or the outside world.
When you feel yourself tempted to engage in the bad habit, stop. Make note of it, and note how you are feeling at the time.
Many people are so used to their bad habits they don't even realize they are doing them. Becoming mindful of these behaviors may help to stop them.

, Once you notice what causes your bad habits, or you have identified any bad habits you currently have, you can break or prevent them. Pausing to question the behavior might help. For instance, if you are about to finish a pint of ice cream, pause and ask yourself, ""Why am I doing this? What am I feeling? Am I just bored? Depressed? What could I do instead that would actually solve the problem?"" Other methods include:


Positive visualization. Imagine multiple scenarios in which you overcome your bad habit. If you tend to sit on the couch for hours and watch television, picture yourself setting a timer, then getting up and doing something active when the timer goes off.
Create obstacles to prevent the habit. Make engaging in the bad habit more difficult for yourself. If you're trying to spend less time online, unplug your router or use software that blocks specific websites during certain hours. Even these minor obstacles might stop you from engaging in a bad habit.
Being accountable. Talk to friends or family members and let them know your goals. Ask them to help you stay on track. If you can't seem to get out of bed before 11am, for instance, you may give your spouse permission to pull off the sheets, open the blinds, and turn on loud music to help you get up.

, When you avoid unhealthy habits, reward yourself for a job well done. Find something (or an experience) that you enjoy and use it to motivate yourself.For example, “Once I complete my application, I can go to the climbing gym and join my friends” or, “If I avoid smoking today, I can download new music.”


Keep incentives readily available to you. Instead of watching a movie right now, use it to motivate you and then reward yourself.

Contact your state Employment Development Agency.,
Apply for UI benefits.,
Complete the UI application process.,
Appeal the ruling, if necessary.,
Attend the One-Stop/Employment Service Office appointment when scheduled.,
Fill out your biweekly continued UI claim form.,
Keep up with your job search.,
To stop collecting unemployment, simply stop filing weekly claims.",How to Apply for Unemployment Benefits," The agency that administers unemployment compensation in your state is the ultimate authority on all UI matters. Before applying, determine whether you meet the minimum requirements to qualify for benefits. These restrictions include:


You must have left your last job through no fault of your own. If you quit your job or were fired for cause, you may not be granted UI benefits.

Acceptable reasons for leaving include: firings, layoffs, downsizing (reduction in workforce), quitting because of harassment or significant family reasons.
Reasons that may not allow you to get UI benefits include: quitting because you didn't like your job, quitting because you were going to change careers, and getting fired because of performance lapses or serious protocol breaches.


You must meet state ""base period"" requirements, which ultimately determine the amount and duration of your UI payments. This is usually computed by examining your earnings over the last 12 months you worked, and then applying a formula to figure out your UI benefit.;
, People seeking unemployment benefits can apply online, over the phone, or by mail or fax. All states require applicants to provide detailed work and personal information. Some of the data you will be asked to provide may include:


Full name.
Current address.
Social Security number.
Driver's license number, or state identification number.
Last date you worked.
Last employer information, including complete address and phone number.
Information on all employers you worked for in 18 months before you filed your claim, including length of employment and amount of wages.
Reason why you're no longer employed. Under certain circumstances, you may not be eligible to receive UI benefits.
Any payments you expect to receive from a former employer (such as accrued vacation time). This can affect the amount of your benefit.
Whether you're currently available and willing to accept work.

, You can expect a ruling on your application within 10 business days. If there are any questions about your application, you may be contacted by a representative from your state Employment Development Agency to resolve any issues.


Expect a simple phone interview before the ruling on your application is delivered. The phone interview consists of basic questions about your previous employment, along with follow-up questions about your application.

, File an appeal within 10 to 30 days of the ruling, depending on the state. (Check your state's requirements to be absolutely sure.) You'll be able to present evidence that your claim should have been granted. Your former employers will be given a chance to attend and present evidence as well.


You may bring evidence or witnesses to the appeal hearing to support your claim. If you claim that your former employers misrepresented your earnings, you may bring in pay stubs to support your claim. You may also bring in witnesses (a coworker perhaps) who can corroborate that you left your former employers because of ongoing sexual harassment instead of quitting.
A judge will hear the evidence and issue a ruling. If you are granted unemployment benefits after the review, your employer has the option to appeal one more time. If you are not granted unemployment benefits after the review, you usually have the option of appealing one more time.

, The appointment is required in order to receive benefits. Workshops are conducted by trained personnel and are designed to help unemployed workers evaluate their own skills and explore opportunities in other industries. The service can also provide job training and counseling.

, After your UI application has been accepted and processed, you will begin to receive biweekly benefits checks. Fill in your UI claim form to the extent indicated, and mail them on the date specified. Any variance from the mail-in date can affect claim processing.


You may work part-time and still collect UI benefits, as long as you declare your earnings and continue to look for work. Report your gross earnings as you earn them, not when you are paid. By law, you are allowed to earn up to 1/3 of your weekly benefit rate before deductions apply.
Any supplemental income in excess of 1/3 of your weekly benefit rate is subtracted from your weekly benefit rate until the number hits $0. For example, if your weekly benefit rate was $325, and you earned $150 in supplemental income for the week, any income above $108 is subtracted from your weekly benefits. This means that you would receive $283 in unemployment benefits, along with the $150 in supplemental income.

, You are required to make job contacts every week you are drawing UI benefits. Failure to look for work can result in the suspension or denial of further benefits. Acceptable reasons for not accepting work include:


The job does not fit with your prior experience or career trajectory.
The job forces you to join a labor union.
The job is unusually dangerous.
The wages offered are substantially below the norm for that job.
The job would offend your religious or spiritual sensibilities.

, You don't need to fill out any additional paperwork if you receive a full-time offer or decide that you would rather not receive benefits. Just stop filing the claims.


If you are out of work again by the end of the year, contact the state Employment Development Agency and reapply. Your application will be much shorter if you've applied in the recent past.

Learn about payment transfer scams.,
Watch out for scams disguised as job invitations.,
Beware scams that ask for personal ID verification.,
Understand unemployment benefit scams.,
Beware scams that offer overseas job opportunities.,
Watch out for scams posing as the government.",How to Avoid an Unemployment Scam1," In these scams, the scam artist poses as an employer, gains the trust of the person being scammed, and then obtains access to their bank account by either:


Asking for bank account information in order to make direct deposit payments.
“Hiring” the person being scammed to deposit checks for them and then wire them the cash.
The problem with this scam is that the original check provided by the “employer” is a fake one, and by the time the banks figure it out the person being scammed has already withdrawn and sent the cash, and so becomes responsible for paying back the bank while the fake employer gets away with the money.;
, In some cases, a scam artist might send an email to you posing as an employer who found your resume online and who has a potential employment opportunity for you.


They’ll typically invite you to complete a fake online job application that asks for sensitive personal or financial information.
They can then use this information to access your bank accounts or other personal accounts in order to get money from you.

, There are a huge number of scams that focus on convincing people that they need to provide some sort of sensitive personal information such as a driver’s license number, a PIN, passport information, bank account numbers, credit or debit card numbers, or social security numbers.


These scams will usually try to convince you that you need to provide this information in order to move forward with a job application or to access some service that you think you’re purchasing.
Most legitimate businesses and employers will not ask for this type of information, and if they do, they’ll do it in a secure, documented, and traceable way.

, There are a number of websites that offer to help you file for unemployment benefits in exchange for a small service fee.


These sites are scams designed to take not only the money you pay them as a fee, but also to obtain important personal data such as your name, address, phone number, email, and other sensitive information that can then be used to access your bank accounts or other sources of funding.
Always remember that the only way to file for unemployment benefits is directly through official government paperwork or websites. Never trust anything or anyone that offers to file on your behalf or by using something other than state-issued forms or government websites.

, Working overseas is an appealing idea to many people, especially those who have recently lost a job or who are looking to make significant career changes.


Many scam artists will leverage this appeal to convince people to fill out fake job applications or to send them personal or financial information that can then be used to gain access to people’s bank accounts or other personal accounts.

, A common approach used by many scam artists is to send emails posing as the government.


These emails typically tell people that they need to fill out a form or provide the state with some sort of personal information that can then be used by the scam artist to access people’s accounts.

Beware requests for personal information.,
Look for suspicious language.,
Watch out for fake forms and fees.,
Check a website’s top level domain.",How to Avoid an Unemployment Scam2," If an email or website asks for sensitive personal information, there’s a good chance it may be a scam. In particular, watch out for messages and sites that ask for the following:


Security codes
Debit or credit card details
Bank account numbers
Social security number
Driver’s license or passport numbers
Your mother’s maiden name
Date of birth
Your full name and contact information

, Many scam emails and websites will use the same types of words, phrases, and terminology. You should be suspicious of emails and websites that use the following:


Consistently poor grammar and incorrect spelling
Frequent misuse of words or idiomatic expressions
The phrase “unemployment filing assistance”
The phrase “file for unemployment extensions here”
The phrase “click for filing for unemployment online”

, Filing for unemployment benefits is free, can only be done by the person seeking the benefits, and can only be completed on an official government website or with state-issued paperwork.


Anything or anyone that charges a fee for filing on your behalf or that asks you to fill out non-government online forms is most likely a scam and should be avoided.

, Remember that the only way to file digitally for unemployment benefits is on an official government website.


This means that if a website claims that it will either file for you or that it has the forms you need to file, but it doesn’t end in the .gov extension, it’s likely a scam.
In particular, watch out for websites making these types of claims that end in the following extensions:

Report changes in personnel quickly.,
Report new hires and rehires.,
Attend appeal hearings.,
File taxes quickly and accurately.",How to Avoid an Unemployment Scam3," When you let an employee go, it’s important that you file this change with your state’s Division of Unemployment Insurance quickly and accurately.


This will minimize the risk of anything going wrong if the former employee files for unemployment benefits.

, Any time you hire or rehire an employee, it’s important to complete all necessary paperwork in your state.


This will help minimize the chance of paying unemployment benefits to a person who’s actually ineligible to receive them.

, If you appeal a determination to award unemployment benefits to a former employee, you must participate in the hearing.


If you file an appeal but fail to appear in court, benefits will be awarded to the employee.

, Failure to file and pay all wage reports and taxes may end up increasing your federal unemployment insurance liability.


To avoid this, and to ensure that a former employee’s eligibility for benefits are processed properly, be sure you file and pay your taxes quickly and accurately.

Read the relevant information.,
Be honest.,
Keep good records.,
Use the correct filing methods.",How to Avoid an Unemployment Scam4," The most important, yet most frequently overlooked element in the unemployment process is reading the information guide provided by your state’s unemployment insurance agency.


If you haven’t received this information in the mail, contact the nearest unemployment insurance agency office.

, Anytime you file a report with the unemployment insurance agency, be sure to be as accurate and honest as possible.


Doing so will help your claim avoid looking suspicious and will speed the time it takes for your claim to be processed and approved.

, It’s a good idea to keep detailed and consistent records of all your interactions with former employers and the unemployment insurance agency. This way, if there’s ever any discrepancy or controversy surrounding your claim to unemployment benefits, you can set the record straight. When maintaining records, be sure to note the following:


The names of people you talked with from the unemployment agency or at your former employer.
The dates on which interactions occurred, and the content of these interactions.
Note the channel of communication (i.e., telephone, email, letter, etc.).
Keep copies of all relevant written correspondence, whether hardcopy or digital.

, Always remember that there is currently no way to file for unemployment benefits other than to do it for yourself using official government forms, paperwork, and websites.


Anything outside these channels is most likely a scam and should be avoided.

Do your research.,
Protect your identity.,
Avoid upfront payments and fees.,
Watch out for pyramid schemes.,
Demand a contract.,
Look for official job postings.",How to Avoid an Unemployment Scam5," Anytime you begin interacting with a potential employer, spend some time researching them to figure out whether or not they’re legitimate. Here are some good ways to conduct this research:


Run a Google search on the potential employer’s name or company name to see if anyone has had any problems with them.
Ask about their track record through your state’s Attorney General’s office.
Search for the employer on the Better Business Bureau’s website to see if anyone has registered complaints about them.

, You should avoid giving out any sensitive personal or financial information online or over the phone, especially if you’re asked to do so as part of a job application process.


In most cases, legitimate employers will not ask you to do this.

, Avoid any potential employer that asks you to pay an application fee, that requires you to pay for a training course before you’re offered an actual job, or that promises you commissions in exchange for transferring money for them through your bank account.


Each of these scenarios is likely a scam designed to steal your money.

, Pyramid schemes will ask you to join a company or pay money into a company in exchange for the chance to make more money when new participants join or pay into the program in the future.


These schemes are often scams, so play it safe by steering clear of them altogether.

, If a potential employer does not provide a contract to finalize an employment agreement, it may be a scam.


Do not enter into agreements or share information with potential employers who refuse to offer you a formal contract.

, If you’ve received an email about a possible job opportunity that you didn’t previously know about or apply for, it may be a good idea to do some online research to see whether or not the company has issued a legitimate job posting.


This can help determine the validity of the job offer.

Be proactive immediately.,

Be realistic.,
Make money from your hobbies.,
Spend time contemplating your own hopes and dreams.",How to Survive Job Layoffs," Before all else, be honest about the depth and strength of the emotional fallout and be gentle on yourself. You're likely to experience shock, panic, a sense of identity loss and fear all at once. Suddenly your dreams are being pulled out from under you, along with your financial stability. Acknowledge that it is all right to feel these emotions; indeed, it would be unusual if you did not feel this way.


You have a right to do what you need to do to cope in your own way.
Don't be afraid to seek counseling or psychological support if you don't feel as if you're coping. The sooner you are able to work through your emotions, the faster you will mend and find yourself back on your feet again.;
, A cathartic activity is to write down your feelings. Put together a letter to the company detailing how you feel about it and the manager's approach to laying off staff. Once it is all down on paper, burn or shred the letters. Keep doing this till you feel the anger subsiding. Keeping a journal is another way of doing this. The reason for writing it down is so that you get it out of your system in a private environment and don't burn your bridges by letting loose a harangue of anger in the workplace. How you leave truly matters, as people remember and word gets around to potential new employers, so aim to leave with dignity.


Try to avoid sitting around and talking about it endlessly with mates, family or other colleagues. This can make the situation a lot worse as you either feed off one another and build a great ball of negativity together, or you frighten those around you with your vehemence and anger. Remember that none of you are likely to have the ""big picture"" of what's going on and a lot of fear can result from hypothesizing rather than focusing on taking care of the ""what next"".

, You will no doubt be regaled with advice about getting a new job, finding interviews and getting back on that career track. It's well intended but it is meddlesome, especially when it crosses into haranguing and bossing. Say thanks for the ideas but you are working through it and that the best thing they can do for you is to identify job leads for you that are realistic and likely to be actionable. That puts the onus back onto them to do more than just talk.


Realize that some people cannot find job leads for you or be of any real help but will act as if they know, especially those who have retired. They have lost touch with the work world you're now a part of, so don't take to heart their fears, worries and insistent refrains that you ""take anything"". Be polite and spend as little time as possible around them until they know to be less bossy.

, If you find it impossible to deal with all the well-intended comments and bossy remarks, tell people that you're not able to discuss the layoff right now but need time to process what has happened before resetting your course. Tell them that you'll be ready to talk to them about it at a later date and that you'll let them know when that is. Preserve your well-being above all.

, Update your resume and build a portfolio of accomplishments. It can be helpful to have a professional update of your resume done, to remove the emotion from going back over your own work history and to ensure that it's in the best shape possible. Remind yourself of two things constantly - you have skills and you will find another job. List all the experience and skills you have. Highlight your strengths and accomplishments. Rework your resume to reflect these.


The difference between someone who wallows and someone who gets moving to find the next best thing is resilience. If you lack resilience, bouncing back will be extremely difficult and you risk giving up. Focus on bolstering your resilience to get you back into the search for a new job.
In between interviews, consider volunteering. It's another networking resource and resume addition all in one. Employers generally respond quite well to this.

, Look at it this way; they owe you big time to provide quality statements about your work with them. Select relevant work samples that demonstrate your abilities such as proposals and reports. Develop a portfolio that focuses on the value you can bring to a prospective employer. If you were a tradesperson, take photos of things you did to add to a document outlining your building, baking, sewing etc. skills. If your bosses have a hard time trying to write references owing to large numbers of layoffs, or their own woes, help them out by writing one for yourself and getting their sign off on it on company letterhead. Demand at least a few minutes of their time to sit down and do this together.


Good references are one of the reason for leaving work in a polite and considerate manner. It's all about guarding your future, no matter what you think about the company or people you used to work with.

, Be open about your layoff and inform every relevant person that you are currently in the job market. It is not a shameful thing; it is simply a reality of companies failing in good money management or being overly optimistic about their projected earnings. Develop a concise but clear summary of what you're looking for and what skills you have to offer. Have business cards ready to hand out at the right moment. Ask for the business cards of people you network with to follow up.

, Develop a structure for your day that involves scheduled activities. Set aside time slots for different activities - networking, job search, researching prospective employers, writing cover letters and sending out resumes. If you need to contact banks and other companies concerning changing payment schedules, include this in the plan as well; facing such needs sooner rather than later is essential.


Get good financial advice from your bank and financial adviser as to tiding you through the layoff period before you get a new job.
Stay connected with friends in the same boat; meet weekly to exchange ideas and possibilities. Share your tales of woe but don't get bogged down in these; try to keep a good sense of humor about your situations and be grateful for one another's friendship through the hard times.
Be sure to include important activities such as exercise, healthy eating and some time spent on hobbies or activities that help you relax. It is important to get out of the house so visit the library to do some job research or simply take a walk through the park. All of this will keep you in top work shape and prevents you from wallowing in misery or turning bitter.

Join-in-the-End-of-the-Profit-Motive.

, If you are financially supporting anything or anyone right now that can wait, let the relevant people know what is happening and that you need to put it all on hold until things are in a better position. People will usually be understanding, although you must get promises from companies and banks in writing, in case they later renege on their agreement to postponements of payments, etc.

, Sometimes you need to practice inverse promotion and take a job lower than your previous level. If this is what it takes to get your foot back in the door and the mortgage paid, do not be too proud. You will show what you're made of in no time and start climbing the ladder again.


Another option may be to start your own business. However, be sure to get very solid advice about what is involved and be careful of anyone trying to take advantage of someone in your position. Also be aware that running a small business is extremely demanding, especially in start-up mode, and you may be working 24/7 initially.
If you have the ability to return to school, consider retraining for a new career or for improving your skills. Don't discount existing degrees or qualifications; always ask how these count towards reducing the amount of additional study you'll need to do.

, You might be able to cash in on your hobbies, the ones you barely had time for while working. Dog walking, photography, selling items on eBay, are all possibilities. Think about what you love doing and turn that activity into a possible side business for enough cash to keep you afloat.

, This is a good time to reconnect with the person you really are, the person beyond the employee. Consider the world that you want to be a part of and give yourself the time and dream space to think this through. You might just find that the next steps you take are considerably different from what you were pre-layoff.

Have a game plan for what to do after you quit.,
Give two weeks notice.,
Notify your boss.,
Be prepared to answer your boss's questions.,
Draft a formal letter of resignation.,
Remain professional after you have notified your boss.,
Once your time at the company is up, leave in a polite and friendly way.",How to Quit a Job1," Once you've decided that you're absolutely sure you'll quit your job, you should make a bullet-proof game plan so you don't get left in the lurch after you quit your job. Ideally, you should quit your job only after you've found another job because it'll be harder to find another job as an unemployed candidate.


Don't assume that you can just ""make it work"" until you find another job. In today's economy, you might be unemployed longer than you imagined. Don't quit your job in the heat of the moment and just assume that you can figure it out after the fact.
Line up another job before leaving. You should spend some time on the job market as you try to leave your current job. You shouldn't be dishonest about the fact that you currently have a job when you speak to potential employers.
If you don't have another job lined up, make sure you have enough money to be unemployed. If you really can't stand your job, tap into a savings account so that you can leave earlier. This means that you will have to budget until you can find another job. When saving up, plan for an extended period of being unemployed just to be safe.
When you do leave your job, make sure you're doing it for the right reasons. Don't just quit because you feel undervalued or underpaid before having a conversation with your employer about it first. If you don't try to solve the problems at your current job to the best of your ability, then you may face the same problems at your new job.;
, This is the respectful thing to do. Remember that the company is relying on you and will have to fill a hole as soon as you leave. If the company has a policy for having to give notice earlier than two weeks, then respect that policy.

And even if the company doesn't have a policy of giving more than two weeks company, if you're one of four employees at a company, use your judgment to determine how much time the company would need to fill your shoes.
Make sure you're financially solvent and prepared to be out of work for the next two weeks in the event that your boss or company dismisses you early (since they are under no obligation to keep you on for the remainder of those two weeks).
Don't give notice too early. Again, you'll have to use your judgment on this one. But if you know you'll be quitting your job because you'll be going abroad or moving across the country with your significant other in a few months, don't mention it until the time is right or you may create an uncomfortable work atmosphere.

, Unless there are extraordinary circumstances that prevent you from talking to your boss face to face, or if you work remotely, you'll have to stay strong and deliver the news to your boss in person. Sending a letter or an email will make you look weak and like you're too afraid to have a serious conversation, or like you don't value your boss enough to take the time to have the talk in person. Here are some things to say when you talk to your boss:

Make sure your boss is the first person in the company to know about your resignation. Don't tell another coworker about it no matter how close you are, and don't do something irrational like post about your new job on Facebook or add the new job to your LinkedIn profile before you quit your current job.
Keep the conversation concise and positive. If you scheduled a meeting, you should cut to the chase. Tell your boss that you're resigning from your position.
Be polite about your reasons for leaving. Don't tell your boss that you feel undervalued and overworked, and that you hate the company culture.
If you've found a new position, just say, ""I've found something that better aligns with my objectives,"" or say that you've found a new job that helps you place more of an emphasis in one of your interests, such as teaching or mentoring. If you haven't found another job, just say, ""I look forward to a new opportunity"" or ""this is the best thing for me and my family.""
Thank your boss. Tell your boss that you had a wonderful time working at the company and that it was a great learning experience. Be sincere about how much you appreciate your boss's efforts. You don't have to go overboard here. Be grateful without sucking up to your boss -- you are quitting, after all.
Ask your boss if you can use him as a recommendation for future jobs. Having your boss as a reference can help you in your future career pursuits.
Remember to stay professional. This is not a time to air all of the personal and unprofessional issues you had with your job. Keep in mind, your boss may be contacted in the future by another potential employer so you want to keep an open, honest line of communication.

, In almost all cases, your boss won't just nod and agree with what you have to say and wish you luck in the future. Your boss will have some questions about your decision to leave, and he may even try to entice you to stay. If you are prepared for your boss's questions, you will look professional and thoughtful, and the conversation will go much more smoothly. Here are some things to be prepared for:Have a transition plan. Your boss will ask how you plan on wrapping up whatever you were working on, or if you were planning a way to shift some of your responsibility to other employees on a given project. Whatever your plan, show your boss that you were thoughtful about how to transition out of the job and not leave the company in the lurch.
Know what you'll say if your boss gives you a counter-offer. What will you do if your boss suddenly offers to give you a raise of 10, or even 20% of your salary? What if he offers to double your salary? If he really wants to keep you there, will you be able to turn him down? When you're considering what you'll do in this situation, you should think about your reasons for leaving.
If your main reason for leaving was that you felt you were unfairly compensated, then you should seriously consider the offer. But if you were determined to leave for a variety of reasons that had nothing to do with money, then don't be tempted by the offer or you'll continue to be unhappy.
Know what you'll say if your boss asks you to stay longer. If he needs you to be there for an extra week or two to wrap up a project, what will you say?

, This is something you can do after you talk to your boss to make your resignation more official. Before you do this, you should understand your company's culture. If you don't need to draft a letter of resignation, then don't waste your time on it, but if it's expected of you, you should follow suit.

The letter is an important part of quitting as this is putting your intentions to leave on paper. If you give your employer two-weeks notice and have evidential proof that you did, he or she can not require you to stay longer at the company than that.
Address the company and date the letter. The date should be the day that you will be giving the letter to your boss. This is a formality that will help if there is any contention as to when the letter was written and received.
Declare your intention to resign. Write,""This is my formal notification that I, (name), am resigning as (job position) at (company)."" It's important to be clear and straight-forward in case of any issues.
State the date when you will leave. Write,""I'm giving my two weeks notice as of (date)."" If you're giving your company more notice, then state your time frame.
Thank your company. Write, ""I appreciate all of the opportunities that (company name) has given me and I wish the company success in the future."" This is an important part of being cordial and leaving on a good note.
Sign the letter. Use ""sincerely"" as a closing, followed by your name and your position.

, Potential employers often call past employers to get a better idea of what kind of employee you were. Leaving on a sour note can prevent you from getting a job that you want later on down the road. After you've given two weeks notice, you should dig in and finish whatever tasks were ahead of you instead of slacking off or daydreaming about the day when you can finally quit.Do what is asked of you in that two week period. While it's easy to slack off or not want to find your replacement, a previous employer mentioning these actions can reflect poorly on you. So do your best to transition the company as well as you can. You don't want people to be frustrated because you left all of your work undone.

, Don't dramatically throw all of your belongings into a box and storm out. Instead, take the time to say goodbye to your boss and your coworkers, and tell them you'll stay in touch.

After all, if you've put in a lot of years at your company, chances are that you've developed some great relationships. Do stay in touch if it feels right.
You can send a group email to your coworkers, giving them your contact information, and even planning to hang out, if you're really close.
Avoid saying anything negative about your former company or coworkers in the future. It can always get back to them and make you look bad. And if your new employers hear you complaining about your old job, you'll come off looking ungrateful and whiny.

Give notice to everyone else affected by your departure.",How to Resign Gracefully," Most people hand in their resignation when they are burnt out and feel like they can’t work at their job anymore. This burnt out feeling often inspires a lack of productivity. While this is an understandable feeling, you should do all you can to do the best work you can on your last project. You may end up wanting a recommendation from your boss in the future (or you may even work with him or her again.) Its best if you are remembered as being a hard worker who gave it their all for the duration of their employment.Be aware of any types of benefits you may be eligible for. If you are about to be laid off, you may have a severance package, or the option to collect unemployment benefits. These can be very handy if you have not secured a new job. Resigning from a position may disqualify you from receiving anything. It may be better in some cases to receive these benefits while looking for your next position.;
, If you want to leave under the best possible terms, don't leave your employer high and dry, scrambling to cover your position. Give at least two weeks notice (or the minimum notice specified in your employment contract if applicable) so that your boss can prepare to have others cover for you, or have time to groom a replacement.Even if your contract doesn't specify a notice timeline, you want to shoot for 2-3 weeks as a courtesy to your employer. Fewer than two weeks and your employer probably doesn't have an adequate replacement; more than three weeks and your employer will be wondering why you're still around.

, Once you've made the decision, don't go blabbing it all over company hill until word gets to your immediate supervisor. Think ahead, like a general, and know that knowledge is power.


Give your boss or supervisor time to absorb and process the information. If the company makes an attractive counter-offer, it will be awkward if you have already announced your plans to coworkers.
Find out how your departure should be communicated to the rest of the staff once you have spoken with your boss. You boss may send out a company-wide email, or he/she may ask you to send out your own personal notice. Do not mention your departure to anyone before you have discussed these details with your boss.

, This is both a respectful and considerate thing to do and your boss and your coworkers are sure to appreciate it. Finish up projects that you have and prepare guidelines for the person who will fill your position. Consider creating a file that explains where you left off on any long-running projects, and other essentials your replacement might need to know about things you worked on. Make sure all of your files are in order, labeled, and easily located--you don’t want to have frantic coworkers calling you after you have left the company because they can’t find one of your files.This is especially important if you are working on a team. Once you have given your two weeks notice, discuss with your team which individuals will take on which duties until a replacement is found for you.

, Never write anything rude, derogatory, or simply mean. You may need to be in contact with your boss later (you may even end up working with him/her again) so it is better to be respectful in your letter. Otherwise, your terse, ugly and childish words may come back to haunt you.Example of what not to write: “Mr. Anderson: I quit. I hated working here. You are stupid. You also owe me $3,000 in vacation and sick days. -Bob.”

, There are quite a few details that can separate good letters from great letters. In your letter, follow the guidelines listed below.


A standard letter of resignation would read something like this: ""Dear Mr. Spacely: It has been my honor to work for Spacely Sprockets, Inc. This letter is to notify you that I will be leaving to accept a new position with another company as of . Please accept my thanks for our association, and best regards to you and the entire company for the future. Sincerely, George Jetson.""

, If you were on a first name basis with your boss, address the letter as such. There is no need to sound stiff if you and your boss called each other by your given names. Plus, using their first name adds a friendly touch to the letter that may lessen a bit of the sting.

, Sometimes, companies will offer counteroffers to an employee’s resignation. If you are sure you want to leave the company, make sure that you make your feeling perfectly clear.


Write something like “I submit my resignation as effective on ”

, Even if you hated every second of your job, try to find something complimentary to say. Something along the lines of “I feel like I have learned a great deal about the art gallery world” is complimentary (even if you really mean, I have learned a lot about the art gallery world and I am never, ever going to be a part of it again.)

, Do not boast, but do mention a few of the projects you worked on, and how proud of them you are. This is important to do because your letter of resignation will be filed away, along with any negative remarks the higher-ups may add to your file. Putting your achievements down will help you if you ever apply to a job that runs through the same HR department, as your file will be accessed and your accomplishments will be one of the first things noted.

, Mention how you are grateful that you had the opportunity to work at this company, and that you genuinely appreciate the people who work there (including your boss.)


Saying something like “I would never have been able to pursue my dream of becoming a prolific author without the insight I gained into the publishing industry by working at this wonderful company.” You may want to thank your boss directly and add any names of people who you appreciate in particular.

, You should not email your letter, as that is considered very unprofessional. Print it out and hand it to your boss when you meet with him or her to discuss your resignation.

, Poking your head in and asking for a moment of his or her time will do--just be respectful of the fact that your supervisor has a job to do, and may not be able to drop everything at the precise moment you are prepared to spring this news on him or her. Another option is to ask your boss if he or she will have time for a meeting the next day. Doing this gives him/her a chance to clear a bit of designated time to focus on your news.


If there is too much going on, you will only add to your his or her hassles, so if it's at all possible, wait for a time when your boss will have a few moments to focus on your news.

, Rehearsing privately will help you be ready when your supervisor has you in to talk. Most managers are extremely busy and they will appreciate your direct approach, forgoing the temptation to ""cushion the blow,"" ""find the right way to say this,"" or otherwise beat around the bush. You might say something like:


""I've been considering my options here for some time, and I've decided it's time for me to move on. I am grateful for the opportunities I've found here, but I must give my two weeks' notice.""
OR... ""I need to let you know that I have been offered a new position at another company. I have really enjoyed working here, but I need to give you my two weeks' notice as of today. Does it work for you if my last day is ?""

, Chances are you've been working with this boss for some time, and whatever your reasons are for leaving, he or she may have some questions. Prepare a response that is concise and understandable. If you are quitting because you hate your job, try to frame your answers in an inoffensive way. Instead of “I hate working here” you might say “I think its time that I head in a different direction with my career.” , Your boss may value you much more than you realized, and make a counteroffer. Being polite and dignified about your resignation could make this possible. You will need to consider in advance whether you would stay for a pay raise, increased benefits, a promotion, or other incentives.


Your meeting with your boss would be a prime negotiating opportunity, so be prepared for it, and know your own bottom line. If staying is an option, what would make you open to it? Check the warnings below, though, because counteroffers can have some serious downsides.
If you are given a counteroffer, be sure to request for any counteroffer to be put in writing and signed. Those signatures would preferably be your boss, supervisor, and Human resources.
When considering a counteroffer, honestly evaluate why you want to leave - and protect yourself. While a raise might be nice, it might not solve other issues that require either a promotion (if your job advancement has stalled) or a transfer to another group (if you have personality conflicts with your boss).

, Be honest, but polite. If the boss asks you if he or she had anything to do with your decision, and they were a factor, it's best to rely on tact and diplomacy to make an honest answer palatable.


In other words, you won't help yourself by saying, ""Yes, you're a lousy supervisor and I (or anyone) would have been way better off without you,"" (even if that's true). You can be truthful without being cruel: ""It was a factor, but not the entire reason. I felt our working styles and approaches just weren't a great fit, and that we never meshed as well as I wished we had. Still, the overall experience here has been positive; and with this opportunity, I feel excited to have new challenges.""

, Remember, the object of resigning gracefully is to always put yourself in a good position with the people you forged a relationship with while at work. If you blow off everyone at your soon-to-be former workplace, they probably won't write you a very nice letter of recommendation, or perhaps not tell you about that sales job that they heard about through a friend. Being tactful, courteous, and smart about your departure will ensure that you've given yourself the best possible shot at success in the future.


Be aware that some bosses don't take kindly to you being ""the decider."" Be sure you can truly afford to walk away from your job that day, because sometimes the supervisor takes it very personally that you are leaving, tell you there's no need to give notice, and instruct you to leave immediately. You will be the best judge of this, so do your best to assess if your boss is one of these people - but be aware, sometimes, you just can't predict what anyone will do. Re-read your employment contract - you must be aware of all the company's and your own termination options. If there is no formal employment contract, familiarize yourself with the default provisions of your state/provincial law.

, Whether your departure is to relocate, to take a better job, or just to get away from this guy, show some class when you're walking out the door.


Shake hands, thank your soon-to-be-former supervisor (yay!) for ""everything,"" and leave.
Go to your work station and stay there for at least 10 minutes. Now you can go blab it to everybody, but don't rub it in your boss's nose - be classy and simply confirm that you will be leaving.

, After informing your supervisor, be sure to personally tell other managers or key employees with whom you have worked that you have resigned. Say it in a way that ""thanks"" the person for helping you develop your career.


For example, ""I don't know if you've heard, but I am resigning to take a position at another company. Before I leave I wanted to be sure to let you know how much I've enjoyed working with you."" These people may leave for other jobs in the future and you want them to have positive memories of you. Who knows when they can impact your next career move.

Consider your financial situation.,
Determine if you will need more education.,
Try taking classes.",How to Switch Careers2," In most cases, switching careers will come with a decrease in pay. This is because you may need to start near the bottom of the corporate ladder in your new career. Make sure that you can afford to take a pay cut. In some cases, you may be able to depend on family to help out financially during your career transition.If finances are a major concern for you, try and stay at your current job until you are making enough money at your new career.
Alternatively, you may be able to supplement your income in other ways. Make small investments or take on a part time job to make up for the deficit.
As a general rule you should save enough money to cover three to six months worth of expenses.

, Depending on your career change, you may need to update your skills and knowledge through education. For example, if you want to become a nurse, you will likely need to go back to school and take a nursing program.Start by taking a course of two in your new field to see if you enjoy the work. You do not want to invest the time and money on a completely new degree only to find that you don’t enjoy the work.

, Start taking evening, weekend, or online classes while you're still at your current job. This way you will continue to make money while beginning the process of changing careers. If the course you need overlaps with your current role, you may be able to get your current employer to pay for your education."

Build a network in your new field.,
Conduct informational interviews.,
Volunteer in your new field.",How to Switch Careers3," Reach out to people in your desired field in order to talk with them and make connections. You can do this by following people on social media sites, such as LinkedIn. Message them from time-to-time and explain your situation and ask for advice. Always give your contact information so that they can reach out to you in the future.Creating a network is useful because these individuals may be able to help you find a job, provide advice and information, and connect you with other people in the industry.
Make an effort to meet people in person, rather than just talking to them on the phone or online.
Share your own expertise and advice while networking.

, Informational interviews consist of conversations with people who currently work in your desired field. They give you an opportunity to ask honest questions about the job, industry, work-life-balance, etc. and will help you decide if this career is actually the right fit for you. Some questions to consider include:What do you like most about your job?
What do you like the least about your job?
What does a typical day look like for you?
Are there any major trends in the industry that I should know about?
How did you begin your career in this field?
What are common entry level jobs?
What kind of education or training does this field require?
What advice would you give to someone considering this field?

, This will allow you to gain invaluable experience working in your new field. This is also a way for you to test out the field without quitting your current job. For example, if you want to switch to a career in construction, you could volunteer for Habitat for Humanity on the weekends.Alternatively, you could help out with home renovations for friends to see if you really enjoy the work and the lifestyle.

Update your resume.,
Apply for new jobs.,
Practice your interviewing skills.",How to Switch Careers4," You may not have updated your resume for a long time. Spend time updating your resume and make sure that you highlight the transferable skills and education that is relevant to your new career.If you are struggling to create a dynamic resume, you can hire a career counsellor to help you construct an effective resume that is geared towards a job in your desired field.

, Search online job boards for positions within your desired field. Apply to as many jobs as possible. You should even apply for those that you don’t have all the qualifications for. If there is a position that seems too good to be true and above and beyond what you are qualified for, apply anyway. There is little to lose and you might be exactly what the firm is looking for.

, It may have been years since you were last interviewed for a new job. In order to be successful in an interview, you should thoroughly research the company. This way you will appear knowledgeable about both the job and company goals and objectives. You should also practice some interview questions with a friend or family member. This will give you an opportunity to speak out loud and determine exactly how you will answer potential questions.During the interview make sure you draw connections between your past work experience and your new career. For instance, you may actually have years worth of experience in management, just in a different field.

Take a step back and think about what you're wanting to write and send out into the world.,
Consider the repercussions.,
Think about the ways in which dishing the dirt on your boss could affect your future.,
Follow the same advice when online as that provided for how to talk about your former employer in interviews.,
Do something that allows you to vent and then move on.,
Let go for your own sake.,
Take the opportunity to improve yourself.,
Change all the names and combine the story with other stories.,
If you have serious grievances against a former employer, instead of writing about it, search on the company or individual and read.",How to Resist the Urge to Badmouth an Ex Employer on Social Networking Sites," Is your anger against your former boss the way you really feel or are you just having a bad day? Even if your less-than-complimentary words are how you feel about this person, is this something you want in permanent, indelible form – the Internet never forgets. No matter what you try to do to hide it, once written and published, it will spring back up again and again. Even if it isn't on the front page, it is in the history somewhere and if necessary, can be dug up to affect your life later.;
, The repercussions are difficult to fathom beyond the initial sense of relief at venting. Beyond that though, word soon gets around and it's likely that your former boss will get wind of it and see the words too. And if your former boss has a good network (most do), they're unlikely to keep quiet about what they think of your lack of decorum and inability to keep quiet about the more negative aspects of your relationship. Your ex boss is still able to affect your life beyond the job simply through talking to other people who might be in a position to form part of your future, and in doing so, your boss has the power to create an unfavorable impression. And in this case, the evidence will be right online for anyone who wishes to confirm what your former boss is claiming.

, Today's employers are all Internet savvy – gone is the transition period where only some thought to do online checks and fumbled around in doing so. Today, it is commonplace for human resources and recruitment personnel to check out your online credentials to see whether or not you've created a good image for yourself in cyberspace. Any whiff that you might be badmouthing people you used to work for will definitely cause such people to try to ferret out confirmation.



Research your name online and see what returns for it. Your presence on the Internet speaks for itself – what is it saying? It isn't just at the interviews that you can get yourself in trouble these days.

, Don't. And if you must say anything, keep it neutral, bland and polite. Venting is something that should remain private always and the reason is not just because your boss will find out about it or even that your future employer might find out about it – such a discovery is bad enough – but the real reason is to do with how your character is perceived. It is hard to trust someone who vents about another person in a public forum because each person who knows that you're capable of this will wonder if you're capable of doing it to them next. And they will also wonder whether you have an ax to grind and are difficult to work with – definitely not something you want future employers thinking!

, You may feel convinced that there is a cozy little online community waiting to lap up your words and return confirmation that your ex boss is one mean old so-and-so but much of that sympathy and connection with other people in the online sphere is false and out-of-context. These people don't really know you, they definitely didn't know your boss or your work situation and they'll only be offering their advice and support based on generalizations and their own often irrelevant (to you) experiences. That small amount of being made to feel good by a few online passers-by doesn't balance well with your venting being unearthed by the people who matter! If you need to vent, here are some much safer methods:


Get onto the computer (not the Internet) and write a letter direct to your boss. You're never going to send this letter but treat it as if your boss is actually going to read it. Let it all out, from the measliest annoyance to the largest gripe, just let it all pour onto the page. Write until you've exhausted the venting and then let it be. You can even print off this letter and burn it, tear it up, toss it to the heavens, whatever makes you feel like you are letting the anger out and setting it free.
Talk to someone who is neutral and trustworthy. Don't talk to former workmates – they still have too much invested in their job to really listen compassionately and they might even gossip or go to the ex boss. Talk to a friend, a mentor, a counselor or anyone else you can trust who will be sympathetic and listen. Be sure to listen to them too – this is a learning experience and you may actually learn more about what you contributed to the state of affairs when a neutral party sums it up for you and that is definitely something to learn from.
Make an anonymous account and change all the names and places if you have to mention any names. Doing this still carries risks because anything obvious and identifiable that can place you, your ex boss and your workplace will ""out"" you. A riskier option but possibly better than venting using your real name and everyone else's real names too.

, Your ex boss may have had two horns and a bubbling cauldron as far as you're concerned but there are two important things to remind yourself. One, that that is your perspective and it may very well not be held by other people, especially if you had a personality clash with your ex boss. The other thing is that by letting go, you free yourself up to stop fighting your former boss long after the job has been left behind. Being haunted by poorly chosen words about your boss online will place a stumbling block in your recovery from the experience, possibly preventing you from moving forward. Instead of pouring your anger out on the Internet, pour your energies into reaching forgiveness, so that you can forgive the antics of your ex boss, remembering that you aren't condoning them but you are allowing yourself to change your perspective about this person. Perhaps some day, you'll even learn to laugh it off and after time, that particular job experience will decrease in intensity.


Time doesn't exist for the unconscious self as it does for our conscious mind. If you continue to hold an unforgiving attitude, you will keep reliving the recriminations and make the offenses committed by your ex boss a living reality now, despite it being over. Don't allow this to become your operating mode. Your thoughts influence your body – make your thoughts ones of forgiveness.

, Instead of groaning about this horrible business and how they screwed you over and so on, consider why they might have let you go versus letting someone else go. Think about what you can do to improve yourself and act upon it. There is always something to be learned from a bad job experience and our temptation is always to put a gloss over it that says ""them bad, me good"". Unfortunately, that avoids the very real possibility that your own contribution to the state of affairs needs analyzing. Fortunately, making yourself face that possibility will enable you to spot your own weaknesses so that you can avoid repeating the pattern in future jobs.


As well as finding your own weak spot, find your strengths within the former job too. No recruiter wants to hear you moan about your ex boss, no matter how much it may be deserved. Instead, focus on all the examples where you performed great work in that job and have them all lined up and ready to fire whenever you're doing an interview. Also work on excellent reasons for wanting to leave that job or for explaining your removal from it. By focusing on the good things and the things that propel you into the future, you can sidestep images of your ex boss looming large when you're asked ""So, why did you leave your job?"".

, Turning it into fiction with enough changes that no one could identify the individual is a good way to vent without remotely touching your career. One bad boss is very like another, so listen to other people's stories and build a profile of a rotten-boss character. Then write the fiction under a pseudonym. You'll receive plenty of emotional support without anything traceable back to an individual who could hurt your future career. Do not use your real ex-boss's initials when creating the character's name. Consider changing the character's gender, race, locality, anything that's not essential to the story should be changed dramatically. The purpose of the story is to vent, but if you write it well you might even be paid for it by a magazine or website!

, Discover whether these grievances are common to other former employees. Consult an attorney or do some legal research to discover if there are legal remedies for what you had to put up with or an unethical or illegal firing. Weigh the likelihood of winning against the risk of being seen as a whistle blower by new employers. Make the decision calmly instead of in the heat of anger. If you didn't bad-mouth the employer at all throughout your research, that may improve your chance of getting an attorney to help you get a settlement. Once the boss's bad behavior is public, he has no reason to want to buy you off and keep you from being a whistle blower. At any time before that point you might be able to negotiate a settlement. Always leave the opponent a way to retreat.

"
"
Weigh the benefits of getting ""fired"" versus ""quitting."",
Speak to your boss about the current situation.,
File for unemployment.",How to Quit a Job2," Getting ""fired"" does not refer to driving your boss to the point where he or she wants to fire you. This refers to speaking to your boss about leaving under the official reason of getting ""fired."" By leaving under this term you are able to collect unemployment and any other benefits you might have lost by quitting, such as stock options, until you find another job. Unemployment is only offered to people who lose their jobs through no fault of their own.

This only works in certain circumstances. For example, if you are working for a company and the responsibilities are too much for you to handle, speaking to your boss frankly can lead to the company agreeing to let you go on good terms.
If you'd like to choose this method, you should have a good reason for wanting to ""get fired."" This means that you were valuable to the company but want to take time off to try a new project, or to spend time with your family.
This method only works if you're not transitioning into a new job. If you're switching to a new job, then you'll be able to get the benefits and compensation of that job.
To make this work, you have to have a strong relationship with your boss. Your boss should know you pretty well and should understand where you're coming from and how much value you bring to the company.

, This is a difficult thing to do but this could work out better for both of you. After telling your boss that you want to leave, you should have an honest conversation about wanting to be ""fired."" Here's what you should do:

Explain why you want to leave. Be honest. It may be because you have too many current responsibilities at your position, that you need to take a mental health break, or that you want to pursue your own projects.
Try to sway your boss to let you go rather than having you quit. While you can't ""ask"" to be fired, it should naturally come up in a conversation. If you are close to your boss, he might offer to let you go with the understanding that it can improve your post-job situation.
Realize that this means you have less control of your ""leave-date. If you are trying to get fired, then you have no control over what your last date is. It could be immediate, or it could be much later.

, Once you've made the agreement with your boss, you can file your application for unemployment to meet the requirements of your state.

You'll receive unemployment checks until you can find another job.

Resign professionally and use the formal method required.",How to Quit Your Job in a Bad Economy," Dig deep into your soul to determine if it's the job or you are just taking a momentary beating by clients or the boss. Sometimes, it's easy to feel as if you just want to flee when times get rocky at work, so you’ll need to take some time to do some real soul searching before you decide to quit. Some things that might indicate it's really time to quit include:


You aren’t sure this is the career for you anymore. Are you questioning whether you are happy in the chosen profession? Some professionals go for decades in a job and suddenly decide they truly aren’t cut out for the job and go in a completely different direction in order to find happiness. Examine which aspects of the job bring you down, but also which areas you love.
You don’t like the company (or certain people or its vision/goals, etc). If you feel affinity to your career choice, but wonder if you're working for the right employer, you may just need to determine if it's the entire company you don’t like, its future direction or just the folks in your department or surrounding team––or all three.
You're feeling overworked without it being compensated or recognized that you've taken on more work. Have you experienced any major changes at work? During a tough economy, companies often cut back and give remaining workers more tasks without additional pay. Consider if the company may just be going through tough times. If you can stick it out, the company will hopefully come out the other end on top and you could be better for staying around.
The company is failing or gradually imploding and you want to be long gone before this actually happens.;
, Sometimes this is a possibility that will enable you to take on new, more challenging and more interesting work than the work you're currently doing. If you're working somewhere that values you highly and isn't going to be happy to lose you, this might be a way of developing yourself a new job without having to leave.


If you’ve been given a promotion, but you're still navigating the in’s and out’s of the job, you might be feeling overwhelmed. This is a situation you may just need to give more time before thinking of leaving. Don't be afraid of asking for training, advice or support. Helping a trusted employee to move up in an organization will often be a cheaper option than replacing you.
Bear in mind any clauses of your employment contract that prevent you from carrying on the same work either as an individual or for another company. This may have a bearing on your decision to quit during hard times if your field or skills are quite specific. It is also important to be careful about relying on existing clients for future work; in some cases this will be unethical, at least for a certain amount of time.

, Before you even start submitting resumes and searching for a new job, think about what it would take for you to financially leave your current company. Do you have savings and/or a rainy day fund that would provide you with float during times you aren’t receiving a paycheck? Savings are a buffer between you making sound, reasoned choices or choices made out of desperation. It's advisable to have three to eight months of salary equivalent saved up, to give you the cushion needed to survive until the next job.Determine what you need to survive by comparing your total expenses to your net income. Include important bills including rent, mortgage, utilities, tuition, groceries, auto insurance, credit card bill(s) and car payments. Do you have enough in savings or a rainy day fund to sustain your lifestyle for a minimum of three months?
Consider all expenses when measuring your income (or savings) versus expenses. This includes recreation such as dining out, clothing and movies and gas money.
Look at your credit card balance. Your credit card isn't an option when you're not employed because there won't be income to pay off what you add to it. Can you pay it down to nothing now and only use it for items that are paid off within the no-interest payment period? This is a noose-around-your-neck that you must take care of above all.
If you live paycheck to paycheck, obviously you will need to make sure you have a “sure thing” lined up in terms of another job before telling your boss to take this job and shove it.
If you aren't saving already, start now. The sooner you do, the sooner you can fulfill the dream of quitting your current job.

, Even if you have money for float, make a concerted effort to line up another job before quitting. In a weak economy, you will have to work extra hard, but if you are truly miserable and need to quit, your extra work will be worth the effort.


The Internet may be your best bet when it comes to landing a new gig. Conduct a keyword search using your career choice and jobs. For example, if you are a writer, search “writing” or “writer” jobs. Dozens of career websites should appear and lead you to possibilities in your area (or in new locations if you are interested in moving).
Tap into your network. From LinkedIn to your current network of colleagues and friends, covertly get the word out that you're looking to change companies or jobs. Consider leveraging your social network as well––you never know where the next opportunity may be hiding.
Try a head hunter. From temp work to executive placement, a head hunter is still a viable option. Remember, a head hunter has to make money somehow so read any contract you sign carefully to ensure that the company who hires you will be paying the fee and not you.

, Beyond jumping from one job to another, consider what other options you might have. Sometimes it is easy to limit yourself to thinking you can only ever do a certain kind of job, when in reality there are many other options provided you're willing to challenge your notions of what's normal in terms of work:


Consider starting your own business. You might have something that you've always wanted to provide as a business. However, this isn't for the fainthearted; you need the right set of skills, knowledge and ability to run your own business and it's not for everyone. Don't see it as an easy solution but if you've done your homework and you know you're right for it, then it could be one solution. Investigate the possibilities while still in your current job so that you have done the necessary research and have developed a thorough business plan before quitting. Also, some part-time trying out of your business before you quit will help give you an idea of the business's likely success (aka ""moonlighting"").
Consider contracting or temporary work. While it's not permanent work, if you have a particular skill that is in demand, this can be an excellent way to make money in between jobs and while you're sorting yourself out.
Sell things online. It is thought that everyone has some things worth selling that are no longer wanted. You can also branch out by investigating options of what you might be able to sell, sourced from warehouses, auctions, estate sales and the like.
Volunteer overseas. Have a total head space break and go overseas to help out for a while. Choose a scheme that doesn't require you to pay but that looks after your needs while you give of your time and expertise. This isn't a job option but it is a chance to reorient your life in a meaningful way if this is an issue for you.

, If you want to ditch your current career completely, make sure you can quit your job and never look back. If you need to go back to school, think about how you will support yourself or your family while you are earning your degree. Talk to different schools about what it will take to get into a specific program before making any life changing decisions –– in some cases you’ll need to fulfill several prerequisites, which may possibly delay your career change plan. You may not need to make such a big overhaul as getting a new degree; investigate night school or adult training in areas that don't require years of high skilled training, as well as bridging courses if you're already qualified in one area.


Consider a part-time job while you are learning a new trade or profession. You’ll still need income while you go to school, so lining up a part-time job is a good idea before putting your plan in action.

, While you may have always dreamed of being a trapeze artist all of your life, leaving your law job for the circus may not gel with the family, especially when there is a mortgage, school fees and next summer's vacation to pay for. Everyone affected by your decision needs to be accounted for, and some of these people deserve a discussion about how your choice will impact their own choices and work decisions.


Don't be surprised at the fear or shock from some family members. Many people believe that staying with a job matters above all else, and even more so when times are hard. You aren't going to be able to convince them otherwise, so don't try. Simply remember that this is your choice and that they aren't in your work shoes but be understanding of their fears. If they are in your immediate family, you'll need to reassure them that you will still be responsible in your family role.
Be ready for some colleagues and other outsiders to be negative. There will be plenty of people who will insist that you'll never get another job in hard times. Realize that they're voicing their concerns and are afraid. While it is understandable that some are fearful, that is not a reason to stay stuck. Life is too short.

, Some industries are experiencing growth, in areas such as energy, aging services, health care, etc. There are books available that explain which areas are in dire need of employees, so it might pay to read one or two of these and see whether you're keen on reinvesting your time and effort to re-skill yourself to work in one of these industries.

, Usually it is best to resign in writing, using a standard form letter. Keep it brief and polite, thanking the company for the opportunity you've had to work for them.


Provide your employer with enough time to hire your replacement. If your employer has always shown you respect during your tenure, return the favor by providing ample time for the company to find your replacement. Typically two weeks is an acceptable amount of time in the USA, but one week may be enough time, especially if the company has a flooded job pool, ripe for the picking. Alternatively, read the terms of your employment contract.
If you know someone perfect for your role, help out your employer by suggesting them. Your employer will be having a difficult time sifting through the hundreds or thousands who will want your job when it's advertised, so you might be able to do your boss a good turn.

Realize the treatment from your boss is rarely personal. Your boss is likely focused on the big picture of your company growth rather than your performance.
Bring in a list of your accomplishments at work.

, Add any new skills and experience you’ve gained at your current job. Having a resume that is current will give you confidence that you can move forward quickly if you do happen to lose our job. Knowing that you’re prepared will take some of the fear of the unknown away from being fired.Send out your resume discreetly. You don’t want you current employers to know that you’re searching for another job.

, If your job has a severance package, see how much your job will pay you in the event that you are terminated. Knowing that you have a little money coming your way while you look for another job will give you a little breathing room.


Severance packages can be worth as much as six months pay.

, Unemployment pay can help you get through the transition period while you’re looking for another job. See if you meet the requirements to collect unemployment in your state.


Usually, you have to be unemployed by no fault of your own. If you quit your job or are fired for gross negligence, you will not qualify.
In most states, you have to have worked at least half the year before to collect unemployment., Before you leave your job, make sure to get plenty of references that will help you secure a new job. You’ll need people to vouch for your work ethic. It’s also a good idea to keep up a relationship with your references by contacting them every once in awhile by email or a phone call.


You want to make sure your references remember you so they’ll be more likely to give a glowing appraisal of your work to future employers.

, Put yourself in a position to be recruited by head hunters from other companies. Contact the human resource departments of other companies in your field to see what positions they need filled. Let them know that you’re searching for a new job.


Don’t let your current employer know that you’re seeking out other jobs.

, Clear your mind of the stress leftover from your job. If you do get fired, you’ll have plenty of time to focus on what makes you happy. You’ll get to learn new things about yourself and reassess your career goals. You may find that you want to do something entirely different than the position you were let go from.Focus on your health. Make an exercise routine. Adopt a healthy diet. Get plenty of sleep.
Have new experiences. You can enjoy inexpensive adventures like going hiking.
Learn new skills you never had time for while you were working.

, Enjoy some quality time with your family. Being overly focused on work can make you forget the things in life that are really important. If you get fired, you’ll have a lot of extra time to connect with your kids, your spouse, your parents and whoever else is an important part of your life.

, Many of the most successful people in our country have been fired. Sometimes, being fired from a position that doesn’t fit you can lead to you finding your true calling.


J.K. Rowling was fired from her day job as a secretary and was even homeless for a short period of time before writing the “Harry Potter” books.
Michael Bloomberg was fired from an investment bank and used his severance package to start his financial data company. Bloomberg L.P. is now one of the most successful companies on the planet., Having constant fear that you’ll be fired can be very detrimental to your self esteem. When you’re out of that job, you’ll get a chance to remember how great of a person you really are. The only thing that changes when you get fired is your employment status. You’ll find that you’re still the same intelligent, capable person you were before you worked there and eventually another company will agree."

",How to Be Dignified in Job Loss," While the reality may be that your job has gone through no choice of your own, you can choose to see this as a transition period rather than as a loss. Every person should have a career objective that over-arches any individual job. Seen this way, while the loss is painful because you didn't make the choice, a job loss can be viewed as part of proceeding through your career trajectory as a whole rather than viewing that job as the sole source of fulfillment of your career objectives. One job alone cannot take you to your ultimate career destination or goals; rather, the lost job is a stepping stone that got shifted along the path to your career fulfillment. And now it's time to find your feet landing on the next stepping stone and the next series of jobs that will take you in the direction you wish to be.


Part of the acceptance process is about preserving your self-esteem. While you may feel rightfully angry and upset about the loss, if you continue to feel this way over a long period of time, you reduce your chances of getting back on your feet and looking for a new job. Avoid seeing this as something that you can't hurdle because you can. And avoid seeing it as someone else's fault; it may well be but blaming doesn't improve your personal situation.;
, When leaving, do so in a manner that reflects respect for the times you had in the job and for the colleagues you spent time with. A dignified exit does not involve upending your desk, throwing rotten eggs at the boss's door or speaking vindictively on your blog page. You never know when such negative actions may come back to haunt you. In some cases, the firm may even be able to re-hire former employees if times get better and you wouldn't want your reputation blotted!


Speak about the positives in relation to what you have contributed and what you have received in return from the employer. This isn't just about leaving a good impression in the public sphere; it's also about reminding yourself to be grateful for what you did get out of the job and how the good things you achieved and learned during the job will help you to find your next job.
Your public statements should reflect a feeling that you have always had the company's interests in mind while working or taking decisions.
Talk about the good times only. What worth is there in dragging yourself through the negatives? It makes you feel bad and it keeps you stuck in anger or self-pity. By all means commiserate over what has happened with your nearest and dearest because job loss is horrible but don't cause your misery about the job loss to become the only way you engage with others or they'll soon find you a bore.
Cut out any statements about unfair treatment and the like. Not only is this airing dirty laundry in a negative way but it could jeopardize your chances of bringing legal action against your former employer if there really is something you can do to get reinstated or to be compensated for the dismissal. The less negative things said in public, the better; save the details for your legal advisers or your diary.

, It can be very easy to mouth off at your soon-to-be ex-employer but to do so can burn bridges eternally and may also impact the impressions of other people in the same industry or field within which you work. The world is small and the chairman of your previous organization and the chairman of the future organization could be part of same governing body or board in some organization or charity. There is a possibility that the chairman or director of your previous company could be associated with your future employer. In fact, given the increased interconnectedness of our world, there is likely to be a connection somewhere along the way even if it's just in passing, so take care of your own interests totally by avoiding bashing your previous employer.


Remember that anything left online stays there and does the rounds too. Be really careful about how you write about job loss online. For example, explaining how you feel or felt generally can be truly helpful to others in your situation but naming your boss and calling him a string of unflattering words won't do you any favors at all. It's not that you can't discuss job loss online, it's about how you discuss it. Use your common sense and your manners when you do!
If you're feeling that you're gagged, think of this as being about common courtesy. Nobody wants to talked about and your future employer is no different – they would be concerned that you have this ""bad habit"" of blabbing rudely when things go wrong for you if they hear your complaints about a previous employer. Yes, you can feel angry, hurt and betrayed but it won't help you to inflame the loss by ranting or cursing others for it. Tread the line very carefully when you discuss the loss publicly and stick to the facts.

, While this happens very rarely, it does happen, especially in a climate of fear where it's easier to blame those being moved out than to accept responsibility as someone still with the company. However, such abuse of your good name can stick and can infect the decisions of others within the same industry when they seek to hire you, so you may need to stand up for yourself or to clear the air in some way. Organizations sometimes spread false stories about the fired employees to justify their actions. If you are a victim of this, respond immediately with the correct version of the events. Be bold and loud about it. Silence from your side will give credence to the falsehood spoken by them. A delayed response will also not have the same impact as the immediate one as by then the people would have believed the version of your ex-employer.


You don't have to do this alone. There are employee advocates, legal advisers, counselors, union representatives (in some cases) and human resources avenues that you can avail yourself of. Don't assume the worst; ask for help.

, Speak about your latest accomplishments in your previous job. This will suppress any stories coming out about your failures from management or even from colleagues. It is also part of the process of salvaging the good that came from your work, so that you're readying yourself to explain to potential future employers the fantastic accomplishments that you have to bring to the new job. The sooner you start to think about the lost job in this light, the sooner you'll recover and find it easier to throw yourself back into the job hunt, feeling worthy and accomplished.


Think carefully about how you present your job experience to anyone – nobody enjoys hearing someone complain about how awful or bad their previous job was because it often cuts too close to people's own experiences and also sounds like whining and inability to make the most of a bad situation.
If you can't say anything nice at all about your last job, don't even raise it as a matter of discussion with friends, former colleagues or anyone else. Change the subject!

, Be honest about your mistakes and create a genuine impression that you have learned from them. If your job loss occurred as a result of things you did (or omitted to do), use this transition time to work through any flaws in you work performance and improve any areas of your learning that might need it. This will show future employers that you are willing to change and to learn, two aspects of an employee that are vital in work life.

, Sometimes your career needs to take a detour because the bills need paying and the groceries need to be replenished. For some people there is the argument that taking something less than your lost job or a job not within your usual field is a come down in life. Yet, in times of need, having a job is better than sitting around griping futilely over upholding your principles. Provided you keep your eye on the overall career objectives and see a temporary job in something that isn't really what you wanted to do as a stepping stone or a holding pattern instead of as a hurdle, you won't take your eye off eventually shifting back to the jobs you really want to be doing. It's when you give up and label yourself as not being accomplished or worthy that things start to fall apart, so stay confident and keep focused on moving through this transition with grace. Things will get better if you keep working at them.

Talk to a manager.",How to Get Your Coworker to Stop Telling You How to Do Your Job," It can be frustrating and upsetting when someone tries to take over something you know you are fully capable of completing. If you’re feeling annoyed or angry, try to keep your cool. Don’t do or say anything you might regret or that might make you look foolish at the workplace.If you need a moment, walk away or take some deep breaths. Return to resolve the problem when you’re ready.;
, Don’t take their words or actions personally. It likely has very little to do with you and is more about them wanting to help or feel important. It’s not a personal attack on your character, so do your best not to make it about you.Remind yourself that this is about work and your co-worker. This will help you stay in control and not react emotionally.

, There are some times when ignoring the behavior is the best course of action. If your coworker is bossy only at times, such as one particular task they used to do before you took over, but leaves you alone most of the time, it's perhaps best to just let it be and dismiss the bossiness on those occasions when they do intervene. If the impact of their behavior in minimal, let it go.

Ask yourself, “Can I live with the bossiness?”

, Sometimes, people just want to be heard. You can acknowledge them and their “advice” without making a big deal or getting upset. When they speak, look them in the eye and listen. Don’t interrupt them. Allow them to speak and say what they want to say, then respond in a way that shows that you've heard them. Without saying anything more (or arguing), let the person know you’ve heard them.For example, say, “I hear you saying you’d use different materials” or, “Okay. Thanks for that feedback.”

, If someone is behaving inappropriately at work, it’s okay to say something. Take a calm and professional tone and say something short and succinct. Avoid making a scene by remaining polite.For example, say, “I know you would do it differently, but this is my project.”

, You might want to say how their behavior is affecting you. If you do this, stay away from blaming and stick to “I” statements. Let them know how their behavior is affecting you and that you want it to stop.For example, say, “It bothers me when you step in and take over my job.” Or try saying, “I feel like you don’t trust me to do a good job on my own.”

, Be consistent and firm in asserting your own boundaries at work. If someone wants to boss you around, respond in a similar manner each time so that they understand that you’re fine on your own. Assert yourself and your needs so that the person knows your boundaries and not to cross them.For example, say, “No, I’m planning to do it this way” or, “Thank you, but I’ve got this covered.”
If you want to be extra clear, say, “I hear that you want to help, but it’s not necessary. Please respect my work and let me complete it on my own.”

, If someone is quick to offer advice to you on your work, take a different approach when discussing their work. Give them an appropriate alternative and interact with them in the way you’d like them to approach you. When talking to co-workers around the bossy co-worker, model a similar behavior.For example, say, “Would you like some input?” or, “Is there any help you’d like?” You can also say, “I don't want to overstep. Is it okay for me to comment on this?”

, Be clear in what you do and who else is involved in the work you do. Schedule a meeting with your manager and go over what’s expected of you. Then, clearly assert the work you do as your own. This can help clear misunderstandings and clarify roles.


This way, you can be clear in any misunderstandings with your coworker. Say, “That’s part of my responsibilities, not yours.”

, Talk to your manager about having some time to discuss your work at meetings. You can make a presentation or update your coworkers on any changes you’ve been making. This allows you to inform people what you’re working on. Give people time to ask questions and gain understanding of what you’re doing.Throughout your speaking time, remain confident in portraying the work you’re doing. If anyone chimes in, say, “You can ask questions or make comments at the end.”

, If you’ve tried different methods to get the person off your back and they haven’t worked, try talking to someone in more authority. Let them know what’s going on and, more importantly, how it’s affecting your work. Ask them for advice or how to move forward. If necessary, ask them to intervene.

Say, “I need some help. There’s someone who keeps trying to take over my work and I’m not sure how to handle it. Do you have any advice on what to do?”

Determine the truth to their criticism.,

Talk to an authority.",How to Accept A Colleague's Criticism," Defensiveness will only cloud your judgment, making it more difficult for you to identify the defining characteristics of your colleague's criticism. Remember that their criticism isn’t a personal attack. See their comments merely as their own observations and assume that they’re coming from a good place.You might feel defensive at first, but remind yourself it’s not personal. Be willing to see things from their perspective.;
, It is natural to have an emotional reaction to judgment, even if that judgment comes in the form of constructive criticism. Therefore, in order to accept criticism and handle it effectively, you should give yourself some time to reflect on what was said. Take the opportunity as a chance for growth.Don’t feel pressured to respond right away. Say, “Thank you” and walk away.

, Whether you’re speaking or listening to their critique, try to stay calm. Even if you feel defensive, using a calm state of mind can help you from saying something that could potentially backfire or hurt you in the future. Staying calm helps you listen and communicate in a productive way. Try to respond with your words, not your actions or emotions.Before you react, take a few deep breaths to lower your heart rate and feel more centered.

, Regardless of whether or not you agree with the criticism, letting the speaker know that you received the message lays the groundwork for resolution and, ultimately, accepting criticism. It removes the power from the speaker and makes you accountable for handling the criticism in your own way.Say, “I hear what you’re saying. You’d like me to complete tasks on deadline.”

, You might start to question every move you make after receiving criticism. This can fuel a vicious cycle and keep you from performing well or doing good work because you’re concerned that it’s not good enough. When you notice yourself engaging your negative thoughts, ask yourself if it’s true, important and helpful. If not, then try to replace your negative thoughts with more positive ones.Notice your negative thoughts and label them as negative. Then, challenge yourself to have a more positive thought. For example, if you think, “They will just return my report back and tell me it’s awful again,” ask yourself how many times this has happened. When they return a report to you, is it to help you improve?

, Be sure that you understand what they’re saying. If you’re unclear about anything, ask questions. If you’re unsure, ask them to clarify what they’re saying so that you can be clear in your understanding.For example, say, “I’m not sure what you’re saying. Can you repeat that?” Or you can say, “Can you clarify that, please?”

, Some people are more than willing to give criticism but don’t know how to give advice. If your colleague is quick to criticize, immediately follow up by asking them how to improve. This information is often much more helpful. This can also signal that you’re willing to improve and want direction.For example, say, “I hear your feedback, but I’m wondering how you think I can improve.”

, If you feel like the criticism is a total surprise, ask them for some examples. If they are only speaking in generalities, take it with a grain of salt. Asking for examples can help you gain clarity on your work or your behavior and what needs to change.Say, “I hear what you’re saying. Can you tell me about an example of a time I did this?”

, Any time you receive criticism, it is important that you handle it in a way that leads to closure. Truthful criticism provides a perspective that prompts you to grow. Take a few moments and reflect on their words. Even if they are hurtful, there can be something for you to gain from their criticism.


Destructive criticism is intended to demean, or manipulate emotions. Criticism from colleagues is destructive when it is presented in a disrespectful manner, and when it lacks substance in regards to how you may improve. Disregard destructive criticism.

, You might be at a loss for words or need some time to reflect on their comments. That’s okay. If you’re stunned or just not in a place to talk about it, agree to meet again to discuss their criticism. This can give you time to digest what they said and formulate some questions or comments for them.Set up a time within the next few days to discuss it further. Bring your own questions and concerns to the meeting.

, Even if you disagree with the criticism or find it harsh, walk away with something positive. For example, you might walk away knowing that while you feel good about your work, your co-workers may see things from a different angle or you need to work more cooperatively. You may walk away thinking you need to watch your comments or share less about your personal life.


Even if you find the comments offensive or hurtful, try to find something you’ve learned as a result of the criticism.

, If there’s a colleague who tends to give feedback when it’s not warranted, talk to them about it. Some people don’t know how to communicate well, keep opinions to themselves, or use tact. If there’s someone who consistently cuts down your work, it might be worth it to confront them about their behavior.Say, “I feel like you say negative things toward me and my work and I don’t appreciate it. Please stop.”
If you don’t feel comfortable talking to them one-on-one, ask for a mediator or talk to your manager about their behavior.

, If you feel like the criticism is unjust or a form of bullying, talk to someone higher up. Some people bully others to make their work seem better or because they’re threatened by you. If this is what’s happening, tell someone. This kind of behavior should not be acceptable in the workplace, especially if it’s harassing and unwarranted.You may want to talk to the person first. Say something like, “I don't find your comments helpful. In fact, they feel harmful and I don’t see a need for them. Please don’t talk to me that way.”

Refrain from complaining about work to your new boss.,
Don't get upset if your new boss questions or criticizes your work.,
Be a positive influence on other colleagues.Some of your coworkers may feel resentful towards your new boss.,
Don't ask for or expect special favors.,
Deal with jealousy.",How to Act When a Colleague Becomes Your Boss," Have no doubts about it, when a coworker joins the higher-ups in your workplace, nearly everything will change. Why? Sometimes, this change is a legal matter, as many work environments have strict no fraternization policies between management and non-management.In other regards, it's just good office politics. Promoting, assigning bonuses, and overseeing layoffs can be difficult when those people are your friends. Bosses have to maintain some objective distance for this reason., You have worked under your old boss for a time, and probably grew accustomed to this person's quirks. Now, you must overcome the initial awkward phase of establishing communication and understanding the style of your new boss.


Minimize stepping on toes or undue tension by being very open to changes, constructive criticism, and be observant in the coming days and weeks. Ask your new boss if he approves of the way you're doing things or if modifications need to be made to any processes. Don't worry about looking like a suck-up right now. Once you get a good idea of what pleases your new boss, you can work without much micromanagement., Handling restructuring at work is always tough, even when you weren't previously chummy with the other person. Moving up from general staff to management means new practices to adjust to and new responsibilities for this person.Try to be understanding and empathetic.


Empathy is the ability to understand another's thoughts, emotions, and experiences. It is a significant skill for effective workplace leadershipShowing empathy could be exemplified by refraining from teasing your new boss about her changing role. You could also pull her aside and share how great you feel she is coping with the new changes. For example, you could say, ""Hey, Linda, you are really handling this new transition well. I look forward to having you as my boss.""

, He may continue to be friendly, but be cautious about how relaxed you are in front of him. Don't confront him if you see him taking a step back, and don't blame him if he cannot continue socializing with you and others outside of work.

, How you travel this new road will determine whether your friendship suffers, your job security becomes rocky, or both.


If your workplace does not have a no-fraternization policy, you may be able to continue your friendship while limiting your discussions of work-related topics outside the office and minimizing the friendliness on the job.
Approach your friend outside the office and congratulate her on the promotion. Say, ""Hey, I'm really proud of you. I know the new dynamic is going to change how we interact with each other at work. But, we've been friends for years and I don't want our friendship to suffer. Let's talk about some guidelines for how we can interact with one another moving forward.""

, This doesn't mean that your demeanor has to change completely around him, but you should be respectful and follow his lead in topics of discussion. Maintain appropriate boundaries when in the office.Proper treatment of your new boss might look like this:Get started on an assigned task without him having to prompt you again and again.
Don't whine when asked to do something.
Refrain from gossiping about your boss with other employees.
Aim to present solutions rather than complaining about problems.
Make your boss look good by presenting yourself in a professional manner.

, You may have been able to share your discontent with her when you were colleagues, but when colleague turns boss, you have to hold back on those discussions. Of course, if she has questions about the work environment and you have genuine feedback, share it. Just be sure to do so in a professional and constructive manner.To present feedback in a constructive manner, have a solution at the ready.An example might sound like: ""I notice we have been getting reports in later and later each week. I was thinking it would be helpful if we created a paperwork hour at the end of every day. This way, everyone can take time to work on reports each day rather than using all of Friday to catch up.""

, He now has an expectation of you that you have to answer to. Learn how to accept constructive criticism. Thank him for his feedback and use the information in a positive manner.

, A negative energy within the workforce will only create bad morale, and your boss who used to be a colleague may be forced to cut social ties altogether.


Explain to other colleagues that this new boss has a new role and, ultimately, new responsibilities. Be a team player and set a good example. Model showing your new boss respect, while still keeping a good professional distance while on the clock.

, Don't expect the the person to give you an inside look into managerial info, or cut you slack when you're not fulfilling your job duties. Don't use your personal relationship with this person to gain special treatment; it could end up harming you down the road.

, You may be feeling a little jealous of your colleague — maybe you wanted that promotion, or maybe you wish your career were moving along as quickly as hers. Instead of acting out toward your new boss, which will only reflect badly on you, consider talking to her about your own aspirations. She may be able to help you advance, or tell you how she did it and strategize with you.

Let them lead in the conversation.,
Don’t brush off their guilt.,
Listen for sincerity.",How to Accept an Apology From a Coworker1," It’s their apology, so let them take the lead. When your coworker pulls you aside to talk, hear them out completely. Resist the urge to interrupt what they’re saying.


Let them get their entire message across before giving your response.;
, There’s a tendency among victims to minimize the wrongdoing of the offender. This doesn’t help anyone, however. It lets the person off the “guilt” hook, and protects you from dealing with conflict. Conflict is a healthy way to deal with disagreement and grow from an experience, so don’t act like you aren’t bothered just to keep the peace.Avoid comments like “It’s no big deal” or “Don’t worry about it.” Saying something like this is dismissive of your feelings, and the other person’s.

, Before you formulate a response to the person’s apology, evaluate the message. Was it heartfelt? Or, did it seem like the person was indifferent to what they’d done to you? Look into their eyes and question whether they truly feel sorry about their behavior.


You can spot sincere apologies by looking for two key elements: the person seems to understand how it feels to be standing in your shoes and the person offers a solution to make amends."

For instance, if you're in sales and marketing, you'll be surrounded by people who are competitive be design. On the other hand, if you're in an environment where competitiveness isn't part of the job description, its presence can seem foreign and unpleasant., Competitiveness has both advantages and disadvantages; painting it in a purely negative light does it a disservice. By only concentrating on the downside of competitiveness, you risk losing sight of the potential benefits. Competitiveness can result in innovation, successful sales and outcomes, and motivation., Be aware that most organizations are a combination of cooperation and competitiveness. Problems really only arise in workplaces where extreme competition is not adequately dealt with.If your organization is all competition and no collaboration, you're probably sitting in a hotbed of negative competitiveness.

, Sometimes the best policy is to be the change you want to see in your workplace. Yes, this is a hard ask, but it is not any harder than fuming silently around the water cooler. Try to set an example for those around you.Use inclusive language. Say ""We"" rather than “I.”
Avoid responding to competitive outbreaks at work with arrogance or jealousy;
As best you can, show competitive people some compassion.

, Accept that you're exceptional and wonderful just as you are. You don't need external validation to prove this, nor do you need more things to show that you're better than anyone else.

Respond appropriately to an insincere or unsuitable apology.",How to Accept an Apology From a Coworker2," Before you let the person off the hook, be sure that they can understand the impact of their mistake. This approach may be slightly uncomfortable, but it helps assure that the person recognizes the consequences of their actions, making it less likely that they’ll do the same thing in the future.For instance, you might say, “I was really angry when you dropped your workload on my desk, especially since I knew you were only blowing off work to be with your boyfriend. I had to work three hours past shift to get everything finished.”

, If you have assessed the apology for sincerity and expounded on how the person’s behavior affected you, then you can move on to verbally accepting the apology. Offer a brief and gracious reply.You might say something along the lines of “I know you didn’t mean to hurt me. I accept your apology” or “I understand why you may have made that decision. I’m ready to move on from it now.”

, It takes a lot of courage to admit wrongdoing and ask someone for forgiveness. Give your coworker some credit for sticking their neck out by showing your appreciation. This doesn’t translate to being a kiss-up—they were in the wrong, after all—but it helps level the playing field and shows that you’re taking the high road.You might thank them by saying, “I really appreciate you coming to talk to me about this. Thanks.”

, Another aspect of responding graciously is keeping the issue between the two of you. If you go blabbing to the rest of your coworkers about the person’s apology, your own acceptance of it seems to go out the window. Demonstrate that you are trying to maintain professionalism and starting off on a good foot by keeping your lips sealed about the matter.

, If you felt the person's apology was insincere, or if you simply cannot forgive them for their behavior, be straightforward about it. It will only make you look bad if you pretend to accept their apology but continue to lord it over them later. Let them know that, while you appreciate their apology, you cannot accept it.


You might say, ""Jordan, it says a lot that you came to me to apologize. But, I can't accept your apology"" or ""I appreciate your apology, but I'm afraid I can't accept it.""
You don't really owe the person an explanation. Simply walk away."
"
Be empathetic.,
Work together to fix the problem.,
Don’t hold grudges.,
Keep your distance with repeat offenders.",How to Accept an Apology From a Coworker3," You can move forward from the situation by spending some time in the other person’s shoes. This can help you better understand why the person may have acted the way they did. When you can see their actions as “human” and not all that different from what you would have done, you are ready to move on.For example, maybe your coworker made a mistake in a report because she’s sleep-deprived due to juggling her job with caring for a newborn. In such a case, it’s hardly surprising that someone may make an error.

, It’s great to foster a sense of teamwork when getting over a rift. The person may ask you how they can make amends. Use this opportunity to work together to resolve the situation and prevent it from happening again.Brainstorm possible methods for repairing the damage. For instance, you and your coworker might schedule a sit-down with the boss to explain their error and relieve you from solely taking the blame. Then, you might describe your plan for preventing future situations like this from reoccurring.

, The worst thing you can do after accepting an apology is hold the situation over your coworker’s head. If the person offered a sincere apology and tried to work with you to make amends, let the issue go., If your coworker is infamous for making mistakes and not taking ownership for their wrongdoing, use this situation as a lesson learned. Minimize contact with the person in the future to avoid being on the receiving end of their misconduct.This may also apply to situations when a coworker said something hurtful or vindictive about you behind your back, but later apologized for it. Even if they seem sincere, you may want to keep your distance in the future.

Maintain a polite and civil manner.,
Try working with (rather than against) competitive colleagues.,
Talk to your colleagues.,
Speak directly to your boss.",How to Deal With Overly Competitive Colleagues2," As tempting as it can be to react in the heat of the moment, try your best to be friendly and civil. Reacting harshly (even with this reaction is justified) can often backfire, encouraging the offender to react to you in worse ways than before. On the other hand, if you remain calm (and don't give them the emotional reaction they're seeking). they may stop trying to get a rise out of you.Also, sometimes when an over-competitive co-worker notices that you don't intend them harm, they'll feel more motivated to treat you nicely in return.
Friendly casual conversation, especially around non-completive or non-work subjects, can help.

, If your colleague is openly competitive, think of the ways that you can harness that. For example, it can often be a useful tactic to ask them for their advice and ideas about things they talk about or do, rather than assuming they're going to run away with all the glory. This flatters them, as well as giving you an opportunity to learn from them. Openly competitive colleague types include:The superstar – this competitive co-worker always needs to shine and will go above and beyond the call of duty to do so.
The weightlifter – this competitive co-worker shoulders responsibility by taking on extra workloads.
The speeder – this competitive co-worker wants it done yesterday. This can be beneficial in terms of morale and motivation.

, Discuss about their feelings concerning team morale and management support. Try to gauge their general feelings and understandings. Be careful not to name call or theorize without actual facts. Later, if you feel there is enough concern, you could consider raising the particular issue of competitiveness for a general discussion., Find out what his or her strategy is with respect to teamwork and shared outcomes in the workplace. Consider pointing out to your boss that a team encouraged to do well as a whole benefits the organization, especially where those who are not performing as well are given help and advice from those who are performing well.You could also talk to higher level management or human resources if you're concerned that your workplace environment is too divisive.

Spot the sneaky saboteur.,
Keep back-up copies of everything you do.,
Keep your boss apprised of the work you've done.,
Cull their snooping.,
Call them out.,
Minimize contact.",How to Deal With Overly Competitive Colleagues3," These people are harder to work with than the openly competitive colleague because they like to undermine through devious means. You can spot a sneaky competitive colleague by the things they conveniently leave out.This includes things like:


Not letting the boss know you helped with a project
""Forgetting"" to send emails to you that concern you
Standing up in front of the weekly work meeting and proclaiming they were solely responsible for some good outcome in which you played a major part.

, A sneaky person is unlikely to change his or her ways, so you'll need to manage around them. Start by keeping back-up copies of everything you do, especially anything involving this person or their responsibilities. In the event the co-worker tries to place blame on you, or show you up in a negative light for anything, you'll be covered., Regardless of what is said openly elsewhere in the workplace, go ahead and let your boss know about your contributions privately. Make sure your performance is verifiable and unimpeachable, and use the paper trail you’ve been creating to back this up., If you suspect a co-worker is physically prying into your business, put a stop to it. Use secure PC passwords to protect any electronic files you use at work and keep your desk and filing cabinet contents locked with a key. Avoid sharing personal information about yourself with such a co-worker. Keep all conversations professional and distant., You may need to approach the sneaky competitor colleague directly, and call him or her on their tactics. This lets them know you're no pushover. If you find this approach too difficult, find other colleagues willing to approach the person with you, and/or talk to your boss about the impact this person's behavior is having on you., If possible, try to minimize your contact with this person. This doesn't have to mean avoiding your competitive co-workers altogether, but if hostile, negative, or undermining behavior is ongoing, stick to communicating with them only when you have to."
"
Be polite but straightforward.,
Send them an anonymous email.,
Play the allergy or vegetarian card.,
Bring a fan to your desk.,
Light a strongly scented candle at your desk.,
Put essential oils on your wrists.,
Be a little firmer and tell your colleague about the perils of eating over keyboard & desk materials.,
Speak to your manager.,
Find a telecommuting job.,
Bear in mind that it might be a case of a pot calling the kettle black.",How to Deal with a Work Colleague Who Has Stinky Lunches," Tell them that you appreciate their wish to eat at their desk but that the odor of their lunch is disturbing you. Let them know that they are perfectly entitled to say the same about any of your food that upsets them. You could also try saying that you're on a diet (possibly for health reasons), and the scent of their food makes it difficult for you to concentrate--but don't say this if you're going to be seen eating a hearty lunch!;
, Make up an e-mail address or use a service that will send an anonymous message on your behalf, telling your colleague something like ""The aroma of your lunch is very overpowering today."" Try it, if it won't painfully be obvious that you are the source. For example, it won't work if there are only two of you in the office!

, If the odor is from something to which you have an allergy, you have every right to request immediate resistance from it being consumed in your presence. Use your manager to assist in enforcing this. Otherwise, you may not have an allergy but you can say that you have one and that you cannot be in the presence of that type of food without having a bad reaction and ask that your colleague kindly consume it elsewhere. Or, if you are vegetarian, explain to them how the odor of meat or fish is very unpleasant for you and is making you feel unwell.

, When the person brings their lunch, point the fan so that it blows air in their direction (although not directly in their face). This should be enough to keep the smell of food from traveling in your direction, although in a small office or when the lunch is particularly potent, this may only be a temporary solution.

, Alternatively, you can use a strong air freshener. Not only will it give your colleague the hint (especially if you only use it when they eat a smelly lunch at their desk) but the strong aroma may interfere with the flavor of their food. If they don't get the hint and end up asking you to stop stinking up the office, tell them that the unpleasant smell must come from the mixing of artificial scent and food, and suggest trying to keep both out of the office.

, Strong scents like peppermint and lavender can overpower the smell of food. Some scents will soothe your stomach or ease a headache. Keep a bottle of oil in your desk and apply as needed. You can lean on your elbow in order to bring the wrist close to your nose without seeming like you sniff your wrist all day.

, Inform them how dirty it is, how colonies of beasts thrive on crumbs under the keys and inside the inner workings of the computer. Not to mention how awful it is to discover squashed food on papers and inside books... This step is for the person who knows that raising this with a colleague will not cause issues though; some colleagues may behave defensively! And, again, this is not something you should say if you're guilty of eating lunch at your own desk.

, If you are not able to say something yourself or you have tried to no avail, raise it with those above you and ask them to say something on your behalf. It is about destroying good team relationships, so they will usually come to help. Keep in mind that some managers may, in an effort to be fair, ban all lunch-eating-at-desks, or even perfumes and colognes.

, People have been eating at their desk for years and will continue to eat at their desks as long as there are offices and 16 hour days. If it bothers you that much, consider finding a job where you can work away from an office environment. All the same, it doesn't mean that eating at the desk is appropriate for a healthy, well-rounded human experience.

, In an increasingly multicultural country, while you might find some ethnic food chock-full of odor, you may not realize that your blue cheese salad or microwaved cheddar popcorn is equally offensive. Rather than whining to your manager, the better way is open up discussions about ancestral and regional foods. A good way to deal with this situation is to organize office ""characteristic food"" potluck picnics - encourage people to bring their most characteristic regional or ancestral food. This will help start discussions and cross-cultural familiarizing with each other's regional foods. Use of the terms ""ancestral"" or ""regional"" foods rather than ""ethnic"" foods are better at avoiding stigmatizing any section of the population.

"
Talk to your coworker about it.,
Choose a friendly and enjoyable location to discuss the matter.,
Be sure that you're not a cause for concern on the pressure front.,
Be thoughtful about your coworker's working style.,
Begin to pressure your coworker.,
If you want something to be done well, do it yourself.,
Give your co-worker the last chance to do things right.,
If your coworker doesn't improve their approach to timeliness of work, talk to your boss about it.",How to Deal With a Coworker Who Leaves Things Until the Last Minute," Before trying to manage the situation, see if it's possible to discuss it in a polite and sensitive way. Be subtle and avoid using any language or insinuations that your coworker is at fault or is working in a substandard manner. The reality is that this coworker may well be getting the work done but their method of timing causes you or other people unnecessary stress because you're waiting on their input. Explain how important it is for both of you to have everything done on time and to have the work under control, perhaps so that there is time to do checks and make any necessary corrections. Be nice, be friendly, and keep the scolding tone completely out of your voice. For example:


""Hey Simpson, I love your work and last week's results proved that your ideas are sensational. I just wanted to ask a favour – I was hoping we might be able to start scheduling our completion date for days prior to the real deadline, to give us time to work in changes and updates. It's hard for me to do everything at the last minute because if I feel pressured, I tend to panic and make obvious mistakes that aren't so obvious to me at the time. It'd be really helpful for me if we could change the pace to make it a little less pressured and to give us that extra space for finalizing things. What do you think about this idea?"";
, Take your coworker out for a coffee or for lunch, to somewhere nice where talking about the matter is easier and not pressured. It'll also be a lot more familiar and your coworker will be more likely to see the human side to your request, especially when you explore how the pressure they're creating impacts on you.


Listen to your co-worker's reasons for that working pace. You may not be aware of everything that's going on in your coworker's job. Be open to your coworker's ideas on how to solve the problem.







, Do your own work on time. You can't try to make your coworker work according to a time frame if you don't. Be responsible about your work, be realistic about timing, and set a good example by being on time within the confines of what is under your control.

, It's a fact of life that some people thrive on the last minute pressure a deadline brings to kick them into real action. Prior to that point, it may not seem as real for such a person and in many cases, the pressure genuinely brings about amazing work because the person tends to focus. The way around this is to keep the discussion to how it impacts your own working style and the need for both of you to reach a compromise. Yet, working together is a two-way interaction and your coworker also has a responsibility to fit into the workplace needs. One way of helping directly can be to guide your coworker to learn more about time management and to carefully explain the ways in which spending time on interruptions, non-productive and trivial activities could be shifted to planning, preparing, and preventing last minute cramming.


Suggest that your coworker might like to read Stephen Covey's book First Things First. This is a popular book that explains time management techniques. If they don't like reading, suggest the audio version for their MP3 player; they can discover the ease of time management on the trip home!
Suggest that your coworker have a read of these articles: How to develop your sense of time, How to avoid common time management mistakes, and How to organize your day more efficiently.
Offer to help your coworker transition to a more timely method of working if it seems appropriate. Don't stick your nose where it's not wanted though; judge everything by the context, the person involved, and the hopefulness of reforming their tardiness.

, If the discussing and attempts at reaching a compromise seem to have been for naught, it's time to apply some pressure. Stop waiting until your co-worker feels like doing their job,and start calling them regularly asking if the work has been completed within the time span that is objectively reasonable. Every time you call, email, or talk to your coworker, remind your them that your performance and timeliness is important for you and that you really care about things being done the right way at the right time. Again, remain polite but emphasize why this matters to you. You might say something like:


""Sandy, you remember how we talked about getting things done on time last week? I'd really like to make sure we stick to that because it's already Thursday, the report's due in the morning and well, it seems we've only managed half of it by noon today and that's pushing things too much for me. I don't like having to stay back after work to tidy it up, especially since it's my cousin Gertrude's coming out party tonight and she expects me to be her emcee. It also matters to me that old John sees we're working effectively as a team and that my timeliness is not under scrutiny for something I'm responsible for.""

, If your coworker is not helping after you talked to them, you have to start doing whatever you can to have things done the right way, even if it means to do their job one time. And before you start thinking that this is going to turn into an excuse for your coworker to force you to do their work every time, don't. Only do this once, ever. After that, go to your coworker and tell them what it cost you in terms of time, energy, resources, and fulfillment to complete their tasks on time to a satisfactory standard. While being polite, be firm and point out the facts of the situation clearly. Firmly tell your coworker that this is the last time you pick up the pieces and request that the two of you try again to make this work. It may also help to insist politely that if this situation happens again, you'll feel obliged to take the matter up with your supervisor or boss to work out an arrangement that is fairer to you. You might say something like this to your coworker:



""Vigo, thanks for the first part of the plan but I really needed to see the middle and end parts by 4pm today. I am due to catch a plane at 8pm this evening and so I decided I'd finish the plan myself in order to get it in on time before I leave. But I'm not doing this ever again; the pressure was too great and I haven't even had time to pack underpants for this trip interstate and I'll be worrying about the other things I didn't get done as a result of spending extra time on finalizing this plan. In future, could you please at least let me know you're not ready a few days before so that we can do something about it much earlier. Seriously mate, I love your work and I love working with you, but if this keeps up I'm going to have to ask Ms Malloy if some other arrangement can be worked out so I don't get so stressed anymore.""






Be serious about it. If it is not working for you two, you have to do something about it, and after all, you have already talked to them before and given them the opportunity to change tactics.

, Everyone deserves a last chance, so before you go ahead and talk to your boss, see how your coworker responds the next time around to another situation that requires timeliness. If all works out, then it could be terrific, and it at least proves that your coworker can manage to be timely and you get to remind the co-worker of this. Cease pressuring your coworker if they've received the message and responded but do maintain vigilance and give adequate reminders of timing to keep them on track. Until you see that they've really changed track, you'll need to remain vigilant. Your reminder might be something like this:


""Sally, that was terrific the way you handled the X job on time. I was so impressed and I knew you could do it! And this Y job is pretty similar and I just know you're going to be able to pull off the same approach within the time frame we've discussed, so I'm looking forward to adding my part from noon tomorrow. Thanks!""

, It's not fair for you to deal with this kind of things at work. You have already done everything you can. This doesn't have to be a case of ""ratting out"" your coworker. First, this is about your working comfort as much as anything else. Second, realize that you can approach your boss and explain how great your coworker is at X, Y, Z, but that you feel let down on the timing issue. This will help your boss to realize that you like your coworker, that your coworker does excellent work in all ways but timing, and your boss will be left with working out how to deal with the timeliness aspect of your coworker's working method.


Perhaps one way you might approach this is as follows: ""Mr Amery, I have really been enjoying working on designing unbreakable toys with Gary this past year. He is incredibly talented and his ability to work out how to prevent kids from ripping apart toys within the first few hours of ownership is astounding. There is just one thing that concerns me though and that is how we rarely get the toy designs ready on time, and how I always seem to be running to the toy factory with the designs just as they're about to be put into the molds. I can't work like this anymore because I also need time to add my colors and special eye and hair designs to the toys and when everything happens at the last minute, I end up doing half the job I'd like to do and I feel somewhat resentful that it's my side of the design process that has to be hurried rather than his. Do you think that there is some way we can work around this or perhaps even have me do different design work for a while?""

Again, make sure your slate is clean before making your complaint. If there is anything you're doing to hold up your coworker, it will be noticed at this stage!

 Let's do lunch.

Make friends. As you start to develop a professional rapport with some people, invite them to have coffee or lunch with you someday. Getting outside the workplace can do wonders for camaraderie.

,

If you share space or equipment with others, learn where it goes and how to care for it. You'll make a good impression by keeping things tidy and in working order.
Arrange your work space for your style. Do you use your telephone frequently? Put it within easy arm's reach. Are you right-handed? Leave yourself space to write on that side of your chair. Organize your desk for the way you work.
Adjust your chair to fit comfortably. Ask for any special accommodations you need.

Clean your workspace, especially if somebody else occupied it previously. Stay a little late the first day, if you need to. People eat, sneeze, and cough at their desks, and you're better off not starting a new job by calling in sick the second week.

Remove the clutter, if any was left behind.
Wipe down your desk with damp paper towels. Pre-moistened wipes or a mild spray cleaner will do a better job. Do not forget the mouse, mousepad, keyboard, the armrests of your chair, the telephone and doorknobs, since all these things get handled frequently.
Collect or request any supplies or equipment you will need to do your job.
Arrange and organize your workspace as you go, too. You may not know what to title file folders or binders until you get started doing your job, for instance.

, The IT or IS department will usually help. Listen to their instructions and advice. Do not forget to ask for assistance installing a printer, if you need to., Sometimes there are various internal and external messages to set up., Depending on your job and your previous experience, it could take anywhere from weeks to years to master.

Ask plenty of questions at first. Everybody will understand that you are starting in a new place, and it will show that you're actively learning.

Establish goals and define your objectives. Do this jointly with your supervisor. You may see what needs doing, or he/she may tell you what needs to be done, or (most likely) a combination may occur. Your objectives may evolve as you settle in, but starting right away will give you direction when you most need it.

Listen carefully to instructions and advice that people offer.
Write things down. Use a notebook, calendar or planner to help keep track of all the new information that is coming your way. When somebody tells you where to go or who to see, make a note of it. It will help you remember what you need to do, and it will demonstrate that you are paying attention.
Repeat back instructions that you receive, in your own words. It's a good way to make sure that you understand things completely, and it will help you remember. You can begin, ""Let me make sure I understand correctly here. You'd like me to...""

, Where is the printer? The restroom? The emergency exit? The cafeteria? If there's a map, take a good look at it., Even if it's not your favorite activity, communicating regularly with your boss is a good way to know if you're on the right track. Do not forget that you can ask questions, give a status report (verbally or in writing), and ask for feedback and recommendations., Either you will figure out what you are doing or you will learn where you are stuck and what you need to ask. Instructions and advice may get you started, but doing is the best way to learn."

Consider an appeal.",How to Defend Yourself in a Workplace Harassment Lawsuit," The plaintiff will start the lawsuit by filing a complaint in court. You will be served a copy of the complaint along with a summons. Note the deadline on the summons for responding to the lawsuit.


You will receive a complaint if you have been accused of harassment or if you own a business and one of your employees has been accused of harassment. As the employer, you are automatically liable for a supervisor’s harassment if it results in a negative employment decision, such as termination or demotion.As the employer, you can also be liable if the workplace is “hostile.” This means the harassment is so severe or frequent that the environment becomes offensive and abusive.Federal law does not generally allow individuals to be sued for harassment; however, your state law might allow it.;
, Read the complaint to see who the plaintiff alleges has been harassing him or her. Harassment is not limited only to supervisors. Instead, the following can create a hostile work environment:co-workers
subordinates
clients
customers

, Take out a highlighter and go through the complaint. Highlight every allegation of harassing conduct. Look for the following:jokes
inappropriate touching or restraining of a person
bullying
offensive language or slurs
offensive comments about a whole group of people generally (such as about the disabled, women, African Americans, etc.)
offensive imagery, such as swastikas, pornographic centerfolds, or racist imagery

, The best way to protect your rights is to meet with a qualified employment lawyer. If your business is being sued, then contact your company’s general counsel or the lawyer you have on retainer.


If you need to hire a lawyer, then you should contact your state’s bar association and ask for a referral.
See Find an Employment Lawyer for tips.

, You must formally respond to the lawsuit by drafting an answer. The focus of this document is to respond to the allegations in the complaint. You must go through each allegation, one by one, and admit or deny each. You can also claim insufficient knowledge to admit or deny an allegation at this time.You should go through the complaint, paragraph by paragraph, with your attorney. Any allegation you admit will be considered true for purposes of the lawsuit, so make sure that you don’t inadvertently admit to an allegation if you think it is false.
If you don’t have a lawyer, then see Answer a Civil Lawsuit for tips on drafting your own answer.

, You should also raise affirmative defenses in your answer. With an affirmative defense, you argue that you should win even if everything in the complaint were true.


For example, you can claim that the federal law doesn’t apply to you. Federal law only applies to employers who have 15 or more employees (or 20 or more if suing for age harassment).If you do not have this many employees, then you can’t be sued under federal law. However, you could be sued under your state’s law.
The employee didn’t file an administrative charge. Before an employee can sue you in court for harassment, he or she must have filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or with an equivalent state agency. If the employee didn’t, you can get the lawsuit dismissed.You can also argue that the employee took too long to file the lawsuit. Once the employee receives their “Right to Sue” letter from the EEOC, they have 90 days to file suit in court.If the employee waits too long, you can get the case dismissed.
Allege that you took care to prevent sexual harassment and provided a mechanism for employees to complain safely but that the employee refused to make a complaint., After you have finished your answer, you should make several copies. Gather all of the copies, plus the original, and take them to the court clerk. Ask to file the original.


You might have to pay a filing fee. Ask the court clerk for acceptable methods of payment.
Make sure that the clerk also stamps your copies. You will keep one copy for your records and send another copy to the plaintiff.

, If the plaintiff has a lawyer, then send it to the plaintiff’s lawyer.

Ask the court clerk for acceptable methods of service. Generally, you can mail a copy of the answer.

, Each lawsuit has a fact-finding phase called “discovery.” As part of this process, you may request documents from the plaintiff if they relate to your case. You can also request copies of any document the plaintiff intends to use at trial.You should discuss with your lawyer what kinds of documents will help you disprove the plaintiff’s harassment charge. For example, if the plaintiff mentions sending an email to a colleague about the hostile work environment, then you should request a copy of the email.
You should also request a list of all witnesses the plaintiff thinks have relevant information.

, In a deposition, the plaintiff’s lawyer will ask you questions under oath. A court reporter then records the questions and answers.You must prepare seriously for the deposition, as anything you say could be introduced at trial.


Your lawyer can attend the deposition along with you. He or she can object to questions. Also, you can consult with your lawyer at any time. Simply state, “I’d like to confer with my attorney,” and the questioning should stop.

, You can expect to be asked embarrassing questions in the deposition. For example, if you make racist or sexist slurs at work, then you should anticipate that the plaintiff’s lawyer already knows this. The lawyer will then probably confront you with the statements in the deposition.


If you are the owner of a business, then you might be asked whether the plaintiff ever complained to you about harassment. If so, you need to be honest.You can leave it to your lawyer to minimize damaging information at trial.

, You can also ask the plaintiff (or any other witness) questions during a deposition.


If the plaintiff has complained that the harassment has led to her being fired, then you might want to defend yourself by arguing that the plaintiff was fired because of poor work performance. During the deposition, you can ask the plaintiff to explain any errors she made on the job.
This is a great question because it is a lose-lose issue for the plaintiff. If she refuses to admit to any errors, then she comes across as lacking objectivity.However, if she does mention errors, then you can bring them up at trial in front of the jury. Because the plaintiff has admitted to making mistakes, then she looks like a poor employee.

, After discovery ends, you can try to win the case with a motion for summary judgment.Basically, you argue that there are no issues of material fact in dispute and that you are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.To determine whether to grant the motion, the judge will look at deposition testimony, your employment policies, and any documents submitted in support or opposition of the motion. The judge will only grant summary judgment if she thinks the plaintiff cannot win if the case goes to trial., You can defend a “hostile” workplace claim by arguing that the challenged conduct doesn’t rise to the level of being “pervasive and severe,” which is the legal standard. Indeed, the law does not prohibit petty slights or isolated incidents.For example, the plaintiff might have heard a couple sexist jokes over a fifteen-month period. You can argue that two jokes in that time period does not create an environment where harassment is pervasive or severe.
If the plaintiff waited a long time to complain after the harassment started, then you can argue that this is proof that it wasn’t severe. The jury might reasonably conclude that if the harassment were serious, an employee would go immediately to management to complain. The jury might also speculate that the plaintiff is bringing the harassment suit now as payback for being demoted or fired.

, If the plaintiff alleges that the harassment resulted in a negative employment action (like being fired, demoted, denied a pay raise, etc.), then you can argue that the employee’s own poor performance warranted the negative action. To bolster your case, you should introduce the following at trial:


Employee evaluations.
Reprimands or other written warnings.
Proof of errors or mistakes made by the plaintiff.
Any documented complaint about the plaintiff.

, You can also argue at trial that you treated the plaintiffs’ allegation of harassment seriously and took appropriate corrective actions. To prove this, introduce the following:


Documents which show the date the plaintiff first complained about harassment.
Proof that you took actions to protect the employee. For example, you might have fired the harasser or moved him to a different part of the business. Introduce evidence that shows these corrective actions and the date you took them.
Evidence that you continued to monitor the harassment, by speaking to appropriate supervisors, for example.
Manuals and employee handbooks which state that harassment is illegal and will not be tolerated.

, Jury selection can be critical in a workplace harassment suit. You want to make sure that you get sympathetic jurors and not those who might be biased against you. During jury selection, the judge will ask jurors basic questions, such as whether they can be fair and what their job is


If you don’t think a juror can be fair, then you can ask the judge to remove the juror for cause. However, you need to point to something that will show bias. This can be difficult. You can’t just say, “The plaintiff is a woman so I think female jurors will be biased in her favor.” In fact, you can’t target jurors for dismissal because of their sex, race, or ethnicity.
Instead, to get a juror removed for cause, you need to show that the juror has admitted she can’t be fair, or knows you or the plaintiff personally.
Your lawyer will also get a limited number of “peremptory challenges.” You can use a peremptory challenge without having to give a reason.Your lawyer might use peremptory challenges to remove jurors who work in a similar position as the plaintiff or who look at you with disgust.

, The typical parts of a workplace harassment trial include opening statements, the presentation of witnesses, and then closing arguments.Your lawyer will be able to cross-examine each of the plaintiff’s witnesses, including the plaintiff.
The plaintiff will present evidence first. Once the plaintiff presents all of his or her evidence, you will then present your case., You will probably have to testify in court as well. Your lawyer will ask you questions and then the plaintiff’s attorney will have a chance to cross-examine you. On the witness stand, remember the following tips:Answer questions in a direct manner. Don’t try to evade the question; the lawyer will be able to get the information out of you eventually.
Clarify any misstatements. If you made a mistake in your deposition, then explain why you were mistaken. If you misspeak while on the witness stand, then quickly correct the error. Say, “I’m sorry. I just misspoke.”
Listen carefully to the question and only answer the question asked. There is no reason to volunteer information.
If you don’t know the answer to a question, then say, “I don’t know.” It is preferable to admit that you don’t know than to guess.

, After all evidence has been presented, the judge reads instructions to the jury, and then the jury retires to begin deliberations.


If the lawsuit was brought in federal court, then the jury must be unanimous to decide against you.Depending on your state law, a jury may not need to be unanimous in state court.

, Should you lose at trial, then you might want to think about filing an appeal. You should discuss the costs and benefits of an appeal with your lawyer.


For example, an appeal can be expensive. You will need to have a lawyer draft the legal brief. You must also have trial transcripts created so that the appellate court can see what happened at trial.
However, if you think you have a strong defense and that the judge made an error, then you might want to bring an appeal. If you do, you must file your Notice of Appeal quickly—usually in as little as 30 days.

Transition from one job to the next without burning any bridges.,
Settle in to your new job!",How to Change Jobs," The search for a new job can take quite a while — by some measures, one month for each $10k in expected salary.If you're looking for a well-paying job, that's a lot of time to be out of work. If your job is truly horrendous and you can't take it anymore, consider quitting. Otherwise, try to stick it out. Your wallet will thank you, as will your future employer: It's easier to get a job if you already have a job, as you're considered ""employable."", You know the saying: ""The grass is always greener on the other side."" A lot of people dislike their jobs for good reason, but some believe the grass is always greener on the other side, and get a rude awakening when they switch jobs, only to find their situation worse on the other side.


It's extremely tough to gauge whether your future job could be worse than your current one. The fact that you want to switch jobs should tip you off that you're unhappy; just make sure you're unhappy for good reason, not some unrealistic expectation of what the work world is like.

, Are you merely switching jobs within the same sector, or are you switching careers? There's a pretty big difference. Switching jobs in the same industry doesn't require nearly as much planning and legwork as switching careers.


Imagine what you'd do if you had all the money in the world. What would you spend your time doing? Would you spend your time traveling and writing about the experience? Would you spend your days cooking? A lot of our most enjoyable pursuits don't pay as well as the ""lucrative"" ones, but if you're truly good at what you love to do, you probably stand to make a good deal of money and have fun doing it at the same time.
Recall your most enjoyable accomplishments and experiences, especially those that are deeply felt and emotionally fulfilling. What are you good at doing? Many people find that they enjoy doing the things they're naturally good at.

, It may sound cheesy, but a journal is a pursuit that will force you to collect your thoughts and start to be honest about your feelings and aspirations (which is a tough thing to do). Use your journal to collect all your positive thoughts, insights, and leads that you gather over the course of your job search.

, Get curious. There are several reasons why it pays to be curious. For one, the curious person is usually a learning person, and employers are looking for candidates who are eager, not just willing, to learn on the job. Second, the curious person is more likely to find a better job fit for him- or herself by asking ""why?""


Ask yourself why you like what you do. Begin to probe. Perhaps you're passionate about sprinting, for example, but don't excel at it. If you tried to become a sprinter, you probably wouldn't succeed. But if you realized that you loved the physiology behind sprinting, you might choose to become a sports doctor.The curious person constantly tries to understand more about the both the world and themselves, making the job/career switch easier.

, This is one of those really tough decisions that crops up as you switch jobs. There are advantages and disadvantages to telling your boss. Ultimately, it'll be up to you to make an informed decision about what's best to do in your case:



Advantages: You could get a counter-offer to stay which would make your job more bearable, although not necessarily more meaningful; you give your boss ample time to find a replacement; you leave your current company not having burned bridges and having been honest about your feelings.

Disadvantages: You could not get a job offer for several months, leaving you in a ""transitional"" period permanently; your boss may think you're simply angling for a pay bump; your boss may begin to distrust your work and make you feel less relevant as time goes on.

, Get all the administrivia out of the way pretty early on. Touch up your resume or spruce up your CV. Bone up on how to write a cover letter if you need to. Begin diplomatically soliciting letters of recommendation from people who know you well and are positively disposed to saying something nice about you. Other things to think about:


Learn how to interview well and form excellent interview questions

Learn how to protect your online reputation

Sort out your elevator pitch if you haven't already

, Networking is probably the single most important step in your new job search. That's because referrals and personal connections (and, let's face it, nepotism) make up the bulk of how people land jobs these days. Why? Referred candidates tend to perform better than random hires and stay on the job longer.So the next time you drag yourself to a networking event when you know you could be sitting at home in your PJs eating ice cream, tell yourself it's for your new, unrealized job.


Remember that people hire people, not resumes. Making an impression in a face to face human exchange is extremely important. People hire people that they like, not necessarily those with the best resume or even qualifications.
Networking can seem pretty daunting, especially for introverts. The most important things to remember are that the other person is probably nervous, too, and that no one thinks about you as much as you think about yourself. If you mess up, no biggie; just brush it off! They're probably thinking about themselves, not about you.

, Say you want to switch jobs and become a parole officer, for example. Well, try to find someone (a friend of a friend will do) who's a parole officer and ask them out to lunch for an informational interview. It might even be a good idea to talk to a warden and ask them the qualities of a good parole officer, for example. More often that you might guess, informational interviews lead directly or indirectly to job offers.During your informational interview, ask them questions about their personal career path and their current job:

How did you find the job?
What did you do before you were a ?
What's the most satisfying part of your job? The least?
What's a typical day look like for you?
What's your advice for someone trying to break into the field?



, It's not called ""pounding the pavement"" for nothing. Going in to companies in person and asking to speak to HR about job openings isn't as high success as networking or getting a referral, but it's higher success than blindly stabbing in the dark with online applications. Here's what you do:


Reach out to HR directly and describe your experience or your desired job. Market yourself — briefly. Then ask: ""Are there any positions open that might align with my skills and expertise?"" Prepare to leave your contact info and/or a resume or CV with the HR department.
Don't be discouraged if HR effectively says no. Ask if you can be updated if/when a position comes up and leave your contact info. If you're still interested in the organization after a month or two, follow up with HR and show renewed interest. Not a lot of people do this, and it shows real courage and persistence — two great traits to have.

, Applying to different jobs online via jobs bulletins is impersonal and easy, which explains why so many people do it. It's fine if you apply to jobs online, but you should probably couple your online search with more personal interactions to up your chances of success. The goal is to distinguish yourself from the herd, not blend in!

, If you're not finding much luck searching for leads, volunteer in your free time for a position you care about. It doesn't have to be long hours, but it should be something that exposes you to the real meat of the job. Volunteering looks great on resumes and occasionally turns into a paid position.

, You can practice with a friend or mentor, or simply try to secure as many interviews as possible and learn as you go. Getting a few practice interviews in is really good practice; you'll be surprised how good the mileage is when it comes time to ace your interview.

, Whether it's a group interview, phone interview, behavioral interview, or something in between, interviews can be daunting because we're asked to distill our personalities and skills into bite-size sound bytes while appearing relaxed and personable all the while. Few things in life can seem as difficult as your first job interview. Here are a couple pointers to remember as you get ready to jump into the world of interviewing again:


Just like networking, the person interviewing you is probably nervous as well. They want to make a good impression, too. They want you to think favorably of their company. The stakes might not be as high for them, but don't for a second think that being in the driver's seat for an interview is a piece of cake. Part of their performance is going to be judged on the merit of the candidates that they bring in.
Pay attention to your body language during the interview. If you get an interview, it means there's something about you that the potential employer thinks might fit in their system. That's great. And while you can't change your skills and your expertise mid-stride in the interview, you can change how you present yourself. Look the interviewer in the eye; remember to smile; work on your handshake; be polite and err on the side of modesty without being totally abnegating.
Keep your interview answers succinct. When you're under the heat of the microscope, time starts to dilate, and a lot of people feel like they're not talking enough when in fact they're talking too much.Pause after you feel like you've incisively addressed the question. If the interviewer maintains eye contact without speaking, that's probably a cue that they expect further elaboration; if the interviewer launches into the next question, you've kept your answer at a good length.
Keep a positive attitude during and after the interview. There will be interviews that you bomb — that's just a fact of life. Don't get down on yourself for a poor interview. Instead, learn from your mistakes and apply those lessons to future interviews. During the interview, especially, don't let negativity affect your approach. Many people think they do much worse than they come off.

, Show continued interest in the people you've talked with. After your interview, shoot off a quick email saying how pleasant it was to meet the person. If you didn't clarify how long you were expected to wait during the interview, clarify now.


People respond to other people, not necessarily to paper. Making sure you treat the interviewer like a person, first and foremost, will go a long way toward cementing your eligibility as a top candidate.

, A lot of applicants are a little meek when it comes to negotiating their salary because they're just happy they have jobs. Believe in your self worth, and translate that faith to your financial worth. Research the starting salaries of similarly-experienced candidates in similar fields and geographic regions. Then, when it comes to naming a number, name a specific figure like $62,925 instead of merely saying $60k — it will make you appear like you've really done your homework., Wait until you've got an offer in writing before you go to your current — soon to be ex — boss and let him or her know that you'll be leaving. Try to schedule the start of your new job so that you give your old company at least two weeks to find a replacement.Any less time and your old company will be manically struggling to find a replacement, making them feel resentful towards you. Any more time and you'll begin to feel like a lost ducky who's overstaying their welcome and becoming increasingly irrelevant.

, It's hard to stay focused or mask your enmity for some employees when you know you're going to leaving soon. Dig in. Here are some things that you should remember while you're waiting out your final two weeks at your old job:Don't pack your bags before you've left. Don't check out. Stay focused during your last days on the job. Instill trust in your manager that you're fully present and committed to doing your work for as long as you stay at the company.
Don't speak out publicly against any of your old bosses or colleagues. This kind of public guillotining gets around and doesn't exactly keep relations tight with your old employer or reassure your new one.
Say goodbye to your old colleagues. Shoot out an email blast to everyone (if you're leaving a small company) or those people you've worked with (if it's a larger company) letting them know you're moving on. Keep it quick and simple — no need to elaborate on why. Then write personal notes to select individuals you established a really good working relationship with. Let them know how grateful you are to have worked with them.

, When it's time, change jobs or careers until you find the right one, the best one, the inevitable one, the one that engages you in “work that’s a worthy expression of who you are.” Then make it your own.

Search for a new job.",How to Kill Time at Work2," If work feels like the last thing you want to do, try to change your approach. Try to have more conversations with your coworkers, or get to know them outside the office to create a warmer work atmosphere. Motivate yourself to finish your work by giving yourself a reward at the end of each hour, such as a snack or a five minute break.

, Wander around and ask your coworkers whether they need any help. Take them at face value if they decline; interrupting their work with frequent offers of help is counter-productive.

, Go through all your unread emails until you've replied to as many as you can. Once that's done, use your mail system's ""folder"" or ""label"" system to organize your mail. You could divide your mail by ""reply by"" date (today, this week, or this month), by project, or by type (announcements, reference documents, and personal).


If your email system is based in gmail, you can automatically filter new messages to sort them into the correct categories.
If you have a work computer with many documents on it, organizing them can be an endless task – which may be what you're looking for.

Get organized for the week.,
Catch up on emails.,
Polish up presentations or reports.,
Evaluate your work processes.",How to Use Down Time at the Office to Boost Your Career1," Use downtime to prepare for upcoming meetings and deadlines at work. Look over your commitments for the week and see if there are any emails, briefs, or reports you can write ahead of time to prepare for them. If you have meetings coming up, prepare good questions to ask the presenter so you can impress everyone in the room.You may also have a list of small tasks that you have avoided doing because you have been busy in the past. Take advantage of downtime to address these items, such as color coding your monthly schedule or organizing your emails by date.;
, If you tend to get a lot of emails on a daily basis, you may have a few important one cluttering up your inbox. Look over your emails and respond to any that are overdue. Get rid of emails if they are no longer important and flag any emails that you will need to refer to in the future. Keeping your emails organized can help you stay on top of your correspondences.You may also create email templates that you can use in the future to make emailing quicker and easier. For example, you may create an email template that you can use to tell a client that their product is ready. Save the template and use it in the future, adjusting a few lines so the email is still personal and custom to each client.

, If you have a presentation coming up, use downtime to prepare for it so you can wow everyone in the room. Polish up the presentation and read through your presentation notes. Add in extras to the presentation so it is at its best.You can do the same for any reports or briefings you have coming up. Read over the report and check for any grammatical errors. Proof a briefing, making sure you have included all the necessary information in there.

, On your downtime, you should also think about your work processes and how you can improve them. Ask yourself, “Am I as efficient at work as I could be? Are there things I could be doing better?” Evaluate how you work on a day to day basis and think about ways where you can improve your processes so you are organized and on top of your work.For example, you may notice that you tend to forget to respond to emails during the day. You may then dedicate an hour of your morning, or a period of your downtime, to responding to emails in one chunk so you do not miss any important correspondences.

Update your contacts.,
Touch base with your coworkers.,
Contact potential business partners.,
Monitor your work’s social media.",How to Use Down Time at the Office to Boost Your Career2," Another way you can use downtime is to update your contacts list. Doing this can help you network more efficiently and boost your profile with important contacts on your list. You may go through your work contacts on your phone and remove any contacts that are outdated or old. You may then network with certain contacts you have not spoken to in awhile or reached out to.You could also go through contacts on your social media and your online work profiles. Organize them by company or client and remove any contacts that are no longer relevant. If there are contacts who you’d like to update, you may reach out to them so you can reconnect.

, You can also network with coworkers during downtime, especially if you do not often interact with them or have been meaning to chat with them. Get up from your desk and go chat with a coworker about a recent project you’ve been working on. Have a cup of coffee with a coworker to talk about a client or a project. Arrange a lunch with a coworker so you can connect about a work issue.Try not to disturb a coworker who does not have downtime like you and is currently working. Instead, reach out to coworkers who have open time like you and are searching for ways to network or connect with others on a business level.

, Use downtime to connect with potential business partners or clients. Use your updated contact list to do this or look through your emails for individuals you can contact. Give potential business partners a call or an email and follow up with them on an idea or a pitch. This small networking move could lead to a contract with the client or a new project for you.For example, you may write to a potential business partner, “I’m following up on your email you sent last week about a potential business opportunity” or “I’m reaching out to you about a project we talked about at the networking conference in May.”

, If your company or business has social media accounts, use this downtime to monitor them. Respond to any comments on your work’s social media to up the company’s online profile. Start a social media thread to garner some attention on social media for the company. Message individuals through social media to set up new projects or accounts.If you do not normally have access to your work’s social media, you may need to ask your boss for permission to do this.

Take an online class.,
Do online tutorials.,
Hold a learning session at the office.",How to Use Down Time at the Office to Boost Your Career3," You can boost your career during downtime by taking a class online that will teach you something new. Maybe you take an online class on public speaking or networking on social media. Or perhaps you take an online class that focuses on a specific program you want to learn or a specific skill you’d like to get better at.Make sure the online class you are taking relates to your job in some way. This way, you will be using downtime to further your career, rather than just for personal interest.
You can find many online classes by searching for the content online. The online classes may be free or have a small fee.

, If you are looking for a way to fill a short amount of downtime, you may do online tutorials. Tutorials are often much shorter than a full class and allow you to learn a new skill in a few minutes. You may search for tutorials on a certain skill you have always wanted to learn or on a certain issue you are trying to troubleshoot.For example, you may search for an online tutorial on how to draw an image in a computer program. Or you may do an online tutorial on an issue you are having in Microsoft Word.

, Another way you can expand your existing skills is to reach out to your colleagues and peers. Set up a learning session in the office where everyone can share their skills and ideas. You may make it a brown bag session where coworkers come at lunch to exchange ideas or thoughts on a particular topic.You may also create a learning session for others during your downtime, where you share a skill or idea with your coworkers as part of a planned teaching session.

If you choose an online game, ensure that it's free of viruses.,
Double check the game’s content and description.",How to Play Video Games at Work Without Your Boss Knowing1," If you honestly feel that you can’t rip yourself away from playing World of Warcraft during a raid, consider making that a “home” only game. Other game considerations include a game that doesn’t require sound (a total giveaway) or a tremendous amount of flash, which may slow down your (and your coworkers') system.;
, The last thing you need is to sneak a game into work only to destroy the entire server with a virus, thus blowing your cover and most likely any security you might have at work. Run virus software for each game and/or scrub and clean the game.

, While your plan is not to get busted playing games at work, if you are discovered, you’ll at least want to make sure the games contain PG type/E-rated content and material. If you bring games that have an M rating and contain criminal or sexual content, you could be in more trouble than just being busted for gaming.

Generally, between 1:00 and 4:00 pm is ideal for a nap. The exact time you choose will depend on your work schedule and your need for sleep.;
, Some people are fortunate enough to work at a company that offers nap rooms. If your workplace doesn't provide sleep space, you may have to get creative.


If you have a desk job, you may be able to get away with napping in front of the computer. Pull up a spreadsheet you're working on and try to nap with your hand under your chin.You may be able to get away with napping in an unused conference room.However, this may be a bold strategy, and it could risk you getting in trouble if the room is needed.
Some offices have infirmaries with available beds. Depending on your workplace, you may be able to nap there.Look into spas in your area that provide nap rooms to customers. This may be a convenient and ideal situation for you, depending on where you work.

, Napping can be tricky. If you sleep for too long, your body will enter a deeper state of sleep. When this happens, you'll suffer from sleep inertia: waking up feeling more tired and groggy than you were before your nap.Short naps lasting about 15 to 30 minutes are best for gaining short-term alertness.A brief nap lasting under 30 minutes will not leave you feeling particularly groggy, and it shouldn't interfere with your ability to fall asleep at night.

, Setting an alarm is crucial when you nap at work. If you oversleep, you could land in trouble with your boss. You may also end up missing an important deadline or otherwise feeling like you've lost a good chunk of the day.Make sure your alarm's ringtone is jarring and loud enough to wake you up, but not so loud that it will disrupt the workplace.
You don't need an actual alarm clock; simply use the alarm on your cellphone, or use an alarm clock app/program on your computer.

, Though you can't control many factors when you nap at work, you'll feel more well-rested if you can create a good environment for sleeping. The temperature, lighting, and sound levels are the most important factors to try to control if you're planning on napping at work.If you have a thermostat in your office, try turning the temperature down a little right before you nap.
A darker environment makes it easier to sleep.Try closing the curtains if you have windows in your office, or simply bring a sleep mask to work.Sound can also affect your ability to sleep. If you can't get out of the office and you'll be exposed to a lot of noise, try wearing ear plugs during your nap.
Comforts from home, like fuzzy socks or a relaxing soundtrack on an mp3 player, can help ease you into a cozy, sleepy state of mind., One easy way to avoid getting in trouble for napping at work is to use your own time to sleep. Most companies offer (or are otherwise mandated to offer) employees a designated lunch break, and many offer additional coffee breaks or smoke breaks throughout the day. Using your own time is an ideal way to catch a quick nap without making your boss feel like you're taking advantage of the company.Coffee breaks and lunch time are ideal for nap sessions because your boss knows you won't be working, but that doesn't mean you have to spend that time eating.
You might also be able to get away with napping just before or just after work, especially if you get to work a little early.

, If napping at work is not allowed, you'll want to keep your nap time private. Resist the urge to boldly nap at your desk or inside the building, and instead look for a private place where you won't be spotted.Your car might be the best place to nap. You can control the temperature, and you'll be guaranteed at least a little bit of privacy.
If you live in a warm-weather climate, or if it's a particularly nice day outside, you might try napping on a bench outdoors near your workplace. You may want to leave your valuables at work so that you don't get pickpocketed while you nap.
If you're really desperate, you may be able to catch a quick 10 minute nap in the restroom at work. However, this can be unsanitary and may draw suspicion.

, If you're prone to feeling sluggish no matter how short a nap you take, you may be reluctant to risk a poor performance. Some people find that a caffeine nap can help prevent this problem, though it may not work for everybody.Drink a cup of coffee right before you lie down for a nap.
Set an alarm for 10 to 20 minutes.
When you wake up, you should quickly feel the effects of the caffeine and hit a level of wakefulness very quickly.

, If management is not too keen on workplace naps, you might want to consider talking to your boss about the potential benefits of napping. In a sleep-deprived society, napping improves the health and wellbeing of employees and ensures that work gets done more efficiently.Naps can help improve focus and productivity during the day. They can also improve an employee's health, which is good for the company's bottom line.
Let your boss know that napping doesn't have to be seen as lazy or unprofessional. Many professionals take brief power naps during the day to reenergize and rejuvenate.
Remind your boss that napping at work doesn't mean sleeping for half the day. A standard nap would run the same length as a normal coffee or smoke break, which many companies already allow.
Don't press the issue. If your boss is against napping in the workplace, trying to debate the issue could get you in trouble very quickly.

, The biggest question to ask yourself before trying to sleep at work is, ""Would I get fired if my boss caught me?"" If the answer is a clear yes, you may be better off avoiding the daytime nap altogether.Some companies may have specific policies that prohibit sleeping on the job. Others may have a general policy about productivity.
If you're unsure about what you can and can't do, try talking to someone in human resources before you attempt to sleep at work.

, If you're allowed to nap or can otherwise get away with it (by napping on your own time, for example), then you may be able to proceed with caution. Naps won't benefit everyone, but if you have a busy and demanding afternoon ahead, a quick nap might help you be more productive and efficient for the rest of the day.If you have a big project that requires your undivided attention, you may benefit from a nap.
If you'll be operating heavy machinery or needing to drive home after work and you're struggling to stay awake, a nap could help.

, Not everyone will feel better or more productive after a nap. Some people just get groggy no matter how short the nap is, while others may be getting enough sleep each night and simply won't need a nap.If you generally feel well-rested, a nap will probably not help you at work.
If you often have a hard time falling asleep at night, napping during the day may make it worse. Avoid napping and instead focus on getting a good night's rest every evening.
If you can't or shouldn't nap at work, try drinking a caffeinated beverage (like coffee or tea) instead. It'll give you an energy boost and keep you wakeful through the workday.

Smuggling Kitty into work won't be a good idea if your cat is a proud and independent roamer who has activities you don't even have a clue about for most of the day and/or night. If he is the type to hop in and out of the cat door regularly, he is going to find being confined in a small bag a day of nightmares and the yowling will definitely let the cat out of the bag even if the clawing doesn't.
Alternatively, if your cat is quiet and often comfortable sitting near you for long periods of time, he may the an ideal stealth cat for the office.;
, Is your cat a seasoned traveler? Does he mind car or public transportation travel? Is he even allowed on public transportation? Are you strong enough to carry him on your bike or by foot? These are all very valid considerations.


If the last experience your cat had of going in a cat carrier involved going to the vet, seeing rabid, dribbling dogs nosing him and he urinated all over himself, then perhaps give this whole idea a miss. On the other hand, if he's the model of good behavior and loves travelling, you're on your way!

, Is it too hot, too cold, too wet or too windy to be carrying your cat around? Use your own good sense of judgement as to whether the weather is an issue for carting around your feline pal, especially if you're subjecting him to non-car travel. In particular, remember that cats are prone to heatstroke, so don't place him in any situation where this could be a problem.

, Preferably, choose a day when you can get away earlier than usual, so that your feline pal is only there a few hours.

, This will enable you to ascertain the best way to get your cat into the office and away from everyone. Mentally review your boss’s schedule in order to determine if there are any opportunities where you might get caught. For the cautious cat smuggler, try the following tips:


Know the layout of your office so that you know precisely, where your boss will be sitting in relation to your area – in particular, know his or her line of sight to your desk or workspace.
Evaluate your workspace or office area to determine where you will keep the cat while you're working at your desk. Map out where he’ll sit and the best place to keep him concealed from the boss and any nosy co-workers.
Review any obstacles or hurdles you might face, such as a meeting or your lunch plans.
Look over your schedule to identify the best day for your cat to come to work. Days that you have to work late or have numerous meetings are likely days to avoid because your cat will be frisky and bored after long hours.

, Buy or find a ventilated bag, preferably one that will conceal your animal and allow you to bring cat food, treats, quiet toys, a soft blanket and even a travel litter box.


Make sure that the bag is not a designated cat or animal carrier - the cat will certainly be out of the proverbial bag if you sneak the cat in using a cat carrier. That is, unless you're able to cloak the carrier and stash it in a corner behind the filing cabinet.

, That way, everyone will be used to seeing you carry ""your new"" bag and not suspect anything out of the ordinary.

, Even if you typically don’t harness or leash your cat, you'll need a system to keep him nearby. Get the cat used to wearing the harness and leash a few days prior to sneaking him into work.

, Stuff the food, harness, leash, toys, litter and blanket into side or surrounding pockets. If your travel litter box will fit, add the box, but be sure you can still fit the cat into the bag the next morning.

, A squashed cat is not the target of your mission. Any items that will not fit into the bag comfortably (when your cat is inside) should be either left at home or could be transferred to your purse or possibly to another bag, made to look like ""all that extra work you did at home last night"". However, be careful because bringing too many bags into the office may draw attention toward you - the idea is to bring one bag containing the cat for the total sneak attack.


If questioned, say you have to return a lot of library books after work.

, Do a test run by packing the bag and then add the cat. The cat may need some practice being inside the bag so give him time to adjust and see the bag as a safe place.


This is a good time to discover your cat's suitability or otherwise to participate in this venture. If he yowls persistently and claws you frantically, he's telling you something loud and clear.
Don't just leave him in the bag. Walk around with him in the bag and try travel with him too. You need to know what he's capable of before carrying out operation cat sneak.

, Give him quality food in a decent amount so that he isn’t starving and meowing for food when you arrive at work.

, This is vital to avoid him having an accident in the bag. This may entail spending a good 10 minutes or so enticing him in the vicinity of the litter box. If you're up to smuggling him in, you're up to this part of the procedure too.

, He needs to know you still love him and that this upheaval is a temporary state of affairs.

, By shortening the amount of time your cat is in the bag, you are also lessening the amount of trauma (and meowing).


A cat that won't go into the bag frontward will be easier backed into the bag. Needless to say though, if you're having this much trouble getting him in, perhaps it's not the right day or time to be doing this.

, If you act like you have nothing to hide, no one will suspect that you do! Remember – your co-workers have seen you carry the same bag before so they have no reason to suspect you have brought in your cat. After all, it's not really the first thing coworkers imagine when another co-worker arrives at work – ""Oh, Alice must have a cat in her bag.""

, Walk briskly to your desk and avoid any water cooler chit chat. When you get to your desk, close your office door or if you are in a cubicle, slide the cat bag underneath your desk into a position that's as well hidden as possible. Put your usual bag up against the front to hide the cat's bag, or use files, the recycling bin or a printer paper box to provide cover.

, Pull out any work you typically do first thing in the morning. Reassure your cat that all is good and give him time to settle before moving him again.

, Clearly, if you've packed his worldly belongings into the bag, you need to remove those as a minimum because he needs to stay comfortable. The fear from the new surroundings, noises, smells and the whole indignity of being taken in to work might be too much for him and he could express his displeasure through yowling, biting, scratching and urinating. If you think it's okay to let him out, the following steps explain what to do next.

, Determine if he even wants to leave. He may want to stay cocooned inside the cozy carrier for a good part of the morning – if that's the case, then let him. He's better off quiet and undisturbed than being petrified.

, Put the harness and leash on the cat before he leaves the bag. That way you won’t risk him running out of your workspace. If he wants to sit underneath your desk wrap loop of the leash around your ankle so he stays close and no one can see you have a leash attached to you.

,,,, This will allow you to escape crowds or peak hour traffic, all things that could potentially cause kitty stress.

, Shut down your computer and put away all the files, etc. Place your cat back in just before you're ready to leave. Wish your coworkers a cheerful farewell and head on out of there. Mission accomplished! You've successfully sneaked your cat into work for a day!

Do your research on the value of naps.,
Be aware that your boss will be looking for reasons that relate to your productivity at work.,
Explain to your boss that you don't take your naps on work time.,
Nap out of sight.,
Offer to share your napping knowledge and skills around the office.",How to Defend Your at Work Napping Habit," It helps to have a scientific arsenal at your fingertips with easily quotable facts about the benefits of napping, in general and perhaps more specifically, while on the job. Some benefits you might quote include:


Napping improves both your productivity and your mood according to Boston University professor William Anthony.NASA scientists encourage astronauts to take naps to combat sleeplessness and thereby minimize ""irritability, forgetfulness and fatigue"".Naps can help you to improve your ability to solve complex problems.A 15 minute nap can rejuvenate an exhausted worker and can be better than a cup of coffee.A 20 minute ""power nap"" can refresh you.A 90-180 minute nap can be ""restorative"" and help overcome sleep deprivation (although this is only recommended for the weekend).Those who nap regularly have been shown to have a reduced risk of heart disease.Life in countries where siestas exist is more balanced and less workaholic. This might only interest a boss heading a creative, quirky firm interested in work-life balance though.
If you're doing shift work, napping can be beneficial as a tool for maintaining vigilance and alertness during the shift. To this end, the UK Royal College of Physicians recommends a 30 minute nap after every 4 hours worked.;
, Your boss is less likely to be interested in the benefits of napping to your long-term health; after all, long-term you could be well out of that job!

, Schedule naps during breaks or lunch, or make up for the nap time by working the extra minutes at day's end. Show your boss how you work this out on your time-sheet, to reassure him or her.

, One of the concerns a boss is likely to have is that you at-work napping looks unproductive. Even though you'll be swearing black and blue that it is one of the most productive things you can do to stay alert on the job, by staying out of sight when napping, you'll at least avoid any misplaced thoughts that you're slacking off in full view. Reassure your boss by explaining that you choose to nap in such places as the car, under the desk, in the sick room, in the locker room, behind a door, wherever.


In places like Tokyo and New York City, it is possible to buy nap spots in ""pods"" for set periods of time. You might like to take advantage of these offers if you can't justify the work nap but still need your day nap.

, Perhaps encouraging everyone else to feel better and more refreshed would be a good thing if your office is a place of constant pressure and stress. Offering your training services as a nap guru based on the grounds of improving office harmony and productivity might be one way of encouraging acceptance of the role of the nap at work. In this case, inform your boss that some enlightened businesses have already included napping space in their offices, such as Yarde Metals in Bristol, Connecticut.Expect most bosses to say no initially. Be persistent and persuasive.
Tie your offer to ""National Workplace Napping Day"", an unofficial US-wide event created by a Boston University professor; the day aims to encourage the nap in the workplace."

",How to Sneak Ice Cream Into Work," The transport bag is key to making this operation a success. Select a bag small enough to hold the desired ice cream container size, but one that allows enough room for the possibility of including napkins, utensils and a small plastic grocery bag (non transparent) so you can dispose of the evidence when you're finished.


Pad the bag with frozen, plastic blocks or cold packs. Keep the bag cold with a thin layer of plastic frozen “bricks.” Some bags will come equipped with the cold packs or frozen bricks, however if your bag requires that you purchase cold packs, bring your bag to the store so that you can find the appropriate size and thickness.






Choose a bag that fits snugly into your briefcase. You’ll need to hide your bag of ice cream somewhere, so consider using the usual briefcase or bag you bring to work.





;
, Bringing an entire gallon of ice cream will most likely not work––let alone the fact that you'll need large freezer space, it'll be immediately spotted by everyone––so you’ll need to select a size that will satiate your pallet and accommodate your freezer bag.


Small selection of cup-sized ice creams. Luckily many grocery stores offer a variety of ice cream flavors and sizes. In fact, some brands even come in tubes or half-cup sizes so decide if a tiny cup size will satisfy your sweet tooth.






Your favorite pint. If you carry a large enough bag and have a freezer bag that will accommodate a pint, pick up your favorite for your office treat. Keep in mind that a pint of ice cream is a lot to eat. The idea is to finish whatever is in the container at work, so take into consideration your appetite and the amount of time you’ll have to consume the ice cream without being discovered.






Transfer the ice cream from a gallon at home to a freezer bag or small plastic cup with lid. Looking for a more economical way to get the ice cream from your house to work? Purchase the full gallon (or more) and then the night before, scoop out the desired amount and place either in a disposable freezer bag or in a small plastic Tupperware with a lid.







, Since you’ll have to concern yourself with the ice cream melting (even though it will be transported in the freezer bag), add your freezer bag containing the ice cream to your briefcase last––right before you leave the house in the morning.


Place the freezer bag in an area of your briefcase that will keep it hidden. Instead of piling it on top, secure the ice cream deep in your bag. It will stay frozen thanks to your freezer bag, but in order to properly conceal it, you’ll need to keep it hidden as you enter the office.







, Remove your freezer bag and place it in the company freezer. Don’t remove the ice cream (as it will reveal your sweet treat), just keep it in the bag.


Be sure your name is on the freezer bag. So that there’s no misunderstanding, be sure the bag is properly marked with your name so that a coworker won’t “accidentally” eat your afternoon treat.







, If you truly don’t want anyone to know you're eating ice cream (which may mean that they will want you to share), you’ll have to enjoy your frozen delight alone.

Check schedules to determine when the coast will be clear. In order to ensure solitude and tranquility while devouring your treat, make sure that the usual suspects will be busy.






Be casual when you transport your freezer bag back to your office or cube. If you act giddy with delight, the jig will most certainly be up. Play it cool as you saunter from the break room back to your office or cube, freezer bag in hand.






Hide your freezer bag underneath your desk until the time is right. Optimally, you should be getting your ice cream within minutes of eating it. However, if suddenly someone stops by for a quick chat or if everyone hasn’t cleared the area, place the bag underneath your desk or in a hidden spot until the coast has cleared.







, Give yourself enough time to enjoy your treat instead of having to inhale it. If you are given a specific break time, use your entire or part of your break to eat your ice cream.


Go to a remote location for consumption. If necessary, take your freezer bag outside and sit on a bench while you eat. Changing your location will also help you avoid running into coworkers (who may want some) too.
Close your office door. If you can eat behind closed doors, close your door and even lock it. That way, you’ll avoid being confronted by colleagues.







, Part of any good covert operation is getting rid of the evidence. If you packed disposable utensils and napkins you can discretely get rid of everything––including the ice cream container.

Wrap utensils in the napkin and secure them neatly inside the plastic grocery bag. You’ll want to remove any trace of your ice cream eating endeavor.






Place the empty ice cream container in the extra plastic grocery bag and place it inside your briefcase. You can go about this two ways: either take the evidence home for disposal or you can knot the top of the grocery bag containing the ice cream container, utensils and any other evidence and place it in the company or outside trash bin.

Exercise.",How to Avoid Looking Hungover at Work," If you went straight to bed from the pub or club, chances are you’re still reeking with the all the smells of the night before. Take a long shower. Wash well all over, from your hair to your toes. Fresh is best for the start of the day.


Have a bucket next to the shower in case you need to vomit. There's nothing pleasant about showering with vomit at your feet.
Watch out for any club stamps you’ve got on your wrists. These will be a dead giveaway of the previous night’s activities.
Again, pay a little more attention to detail than you would during a usual shower. If you have the time, repeat all your usual steps for a deeper clean.;
, Today won’t be the day to relax your dress habits. Whatever the dress code of your work is, reach for its upper limits. Try to remember a day where you felt you looked your best, and dress the exact same.


If your office dress is appropriately formal, go for the nicest pieces in your wardrobe. Don't go for something too flashy that will draw conversation. Iron or press anything that needs it.
When the dress is casual, throw on whatever you’ve got that’s clean and doesn’t draw too much attention. Just take the time to make sure everything’s on the right way and fits well. Avoid looking disheveled this way.

, Even if you’ve showered and made sure to dress as well as you can, it won’t do much if you’re eyes are still bloodshot or sunken. The devil will definitely be in the details when it comes to making sure no one notices your hangover. Unfortunately, since it’s such a shared experience, most people can spot the subtle clues.


Use eye drops to remove red eyes. While you could plead a sudden attack of hay fever, this won't always work. Use the eye drops to clear up your eyes and avoid pointed questioning.
Use makeup to hide those eye-bags. Eyeliner on the 'waterline' of the eye makes it look less bloodshot, and a dash of blush fakes the look of health that you will be sorely missing. Men can reach for a slice of cucumber or damp tea bags to fix sunken, swollen eyes.

, Nothing broadcasts your long night out better than tousled, unkempt hair. If anything, a messy hair-do is an easy conversation starter for any curious coworkers wanting to ask about the night before. Avoid scrutiny by ensuring that every single hair is neatly in place.


If you normally rock a well-sculpted cut that takes time to get ready, prepare to do the same even on the morning of a hangover. You could opt for a more economic style, but beware coworkers asking where your normal style went.
Keep a comb or brush handy at your work or in your car for mornings like these. Often it will be enough to make sure there are no cowlicks.

, Alcohol has the tendency to linger in your breath. Even if you can't tell whether it smells or not, assume that it does. Unfortunately this is one of the toughest things to notice yourself while also being one of the easiest to spot for everyone else.


Be sure to brush your teeth and use a strong and pleasant mouthwash to rinse.
Through the day, suck peppermint candies or chew mint gum. Be careful not to do this when it might be socially inappropriate, such as in a meeting or speaking with a superior.

, Most likely you’ll be hungry from a hangover anyway. Unfortunately our instincts won’t always serve us well in these instances. Very often we’ll reach for grease or carbs to sate our hunger, but these won’t necessarily be the best for you. Grease may end up upsetting your stomach and excess carbs can leave you feeling heavy.Shoot for a breakfast of fruit, eggs, and oatmeal. Try to have two out of the three at least. These will give you energy to push through the day.
Drink plenty of water with breakfast. You will quickly find that you’ll want to keep drinking water throughout the day, so get a head start with your first meal.
Avoid juice. Although a healthy option, the acidity of the juice poses the risk of bothering your stomach more than it already has been. Stick to water if possible.

, Do your best to limit personal interaction. The easiest way to not look hungover is to limit how much you’ll be looked at. Avoid long conversations with others and when forced into them, do more listening than speaking. Provided they’re not your superior, a terse “sorry, I’ve got to get back to my work” should deflect any chatty coworkers.


Stay away from as many people as you can - your coworkers, your boss, your clients and especially anyone notorious for office gossip. Hopefully your scarcity will be taken as a sign of hard work.
If you are an underage drinker, this poses a range of risks. Not only can it be detrimental to your health if you drink irresponsibly, but you are at a high risk of being caught, and likely reported to an official. Most individuals will roll their eyes and go on with their day, but there are few that will take note and inform someone who will do something about it. If your coworkers seem suspicious and question why you are acting unusual, simply respond that you were working on a project or thing (of your choice) and didn't complete it until the early morning. Plan your excuse if you choose to take this route, but remember the consequences of if you are caught. If you are worried, simply don't drink beforehand.
If you can't get away from a meeting, stare intensely at each speaker. Allow your mind to completely shut down while you ""look engaged.” Be careful not to zone out so much that you’ll look unresponsive, especially if you’re likely to be asked anything.

, Though the previous step cautions discretion, don’t be so unreachable that it’s odd or especially noticeable. Try to make your day exceptionally unexceptional: do everything you normally would, no more or less. Remember in all things you’re trying to avoid suspicion and attention. So much of not looking hungover at work will be trying to look as normal as possible., Again, you’re looking to have to explain yourself very little on the day of a hangover. Don’t trap yourself into having to lie about being late.
Keep the day’s schedule. If your job involves a lot of meetings or organized face-to-face time, you’ll unfortunately need to maintain this. It’s far too suspicious to try and cancel things.
Watch how you speak with others as well. Keep from being curt, dismissive, or tired with others (even if you are). Maintain a smile and excuse yourself from conversations whenever appropriate.

, If you attempt to get through work like a maniac in an attempt to look put together, you'll set yourself up to make a mistake. That’ll be one more thing have to explain away, which you’ll need to avoid. Work deliberately and slowly if you have to. It’s better to work well than to work a lot; it’s easy to blame a slow day on a bad night’s sleep.


Find something more menial and less intellectual to maintain a steady-but-productive work look throughout the day.
If you’re really looking to do the bare minimum, ask your immediate superior what really needs doing that day in particular. Note though that this might draw their attention to you throughout the day.

, Nobody needs to know you’re hungover. You may a look a little worse for wear, but if anyone asks you can blame it on any number of things from not sleeping well to the chance that you might be getting a cold. Nothing will undo your hard work disguising your hangover like office gossip.Depending on your social media presence, your coworkers may already know some about your night before. If asked, be vague; “oh I had a great time,” or “Yeah, it was a blast.”
There’s a chance a co-worker was the with you the night before. Hopefully you’ll know about situations like these in advance, and you both can agree on mutual silence. If it’s someone you don’t know too well, be prepared for the worst. They may tell more than you’d like.

, A hangover can cause you all sorts of physical discomfort. Co-workers will develop concern and wonder if you look bowled over in pain, or if they hear you vomit. Fortunately, the most common problems can be fixed with over-the-counter medication. If you’re a regular drinker or know when you’ll have a hangover, try to keep these in stock.


If you feel like you might vomit, drink an Alka-seltzer or take some Pepto-Bismol, as they both settle your stomach. Have an excuse such as food poisoning if you get caught throwing up. If time allows, consider going to a bathroom on another floor or at another office to avoid being seen or heard.
If you're in pain with a throbbing head, take some painkillers before arriving at work and keep more to take during the day. Use ibuprofen (Advil) or naproxen (Aleve) as opposed to acetaminophen (Tylenol), as it puts stress on your already stressed liver.

, Once at work, drink plenty of water throughout the day to help keep you awake and reasonably alert. Sports drinks such like Powerade or Gatorade are useful as well. They contain electrolytes which can aid rehydration. Alcohol dehydrates, so you’ll need to put back what’s been taken out.Initially, sip the water slowly. If you're feeling like you're going to vomit, anything you consume can trigger the need to throw up. As the day wears on, you'll probably be able to drink more and faster.
You may have people prod you about why you’re drinking so much water. Explain to them that you think you might be sick, and are hydrating to try and avoid it. Hopefully then they avoid you in order to do the same.

, If you’ve got the time before work or during lunch, take just ten minutes to get the heart and sweat going. If only to wake you up a little bit, exercise can help to jump start your body into flushing away the hangover feeling. Even if you’re a seasoned athlete, do over-do it on a hangover day; just enough to get the heart pumping should be good.If you haven’t exercised in quite some time, it may not be the best idea to start the morning of a hangover. Take it easy and follow the other steps here.
If you haven’t the time or resources to exercise fully, try to walk to work if it’s feasible. Even that should be enough to get your body started.

Determine if your company plans to participate.,
Discuss the idea with your boss.,
Consider partnering and/or sponsoring a local adoption organization or shelter.,
Establish rules about what dog owners can and cannot do while their dog is at work.,
Promote and prepare for the special day.,
Take photos of the day your dog came to the office.",How to Celebrate Take Your Dog to Work Day," Find out if your company is already on board with celebrating the day. Talk to your human resources professional to see if this is day they plan to recognize. If it’s a completely new concept, ask him or her if you can direct them to the “Take Your Dog To Work” day (TYDTWD) website and try to get their impression of how they feel about celebrating the day. If there are no major concerns, take the next step and talk with your boss.;
, The official TYDTWD site has several ways to “win over” your boss. However, a few simple steps you can take include planning what you will say to him or her ahead of time, addressing any concerns about having dogs roaming the office during work hours and liability drawbacks. Inspire your boss with talk that emphasizing how productive it can be to have dogs at work and how dog-owning employees will embrace this opportunity and see the workplace as inclusive of their pets.

Share the benefits of participating in the day, such as the stat that 55 million Americans believe that having a pet in the workplace leads to a more creative environment and 38 million people find that the work environment is more productive if a pet is present. You could also show your boss how some offices, like Red Balloon, actually own an office dog that is cared for by everyone and even taken for walks by employees at lunchtime, all in the name of making work fun and therefore, more productive.Download the TYDTWD Action Pack. Of course, you can participate and celebrate the day without registering your company. However, the organization offers special tips and ways to make the day run smoothly.

, One of the best ways to show your affection for your four legged friend is to promote adoption through rescue. Show your support by either asking representatives to come to your office with adoptable pets or bring information about their organization to be handed out to employees and clients.


Contact your local humane society. Every county has a chapter of the National Humane Society, so conduct a quick Internet or phone book search for a location near your office.
Sponsor a national adoption group. Organizations such as Adopt-a-Pet or the ASPCA are always in need of support.
Reach out to local rescue groups. Some local rescue groups specialize in certain breeds so if your office is full of Labrador Retriever lovers you may want to sponsor a local Lab rescue organization.

, Although many dog owners may contend that they have a very well behaved, adaptable dog, a room full of dogs that do not know each other can create pandemonium. Before inviting employees’ dogs to work, establish some clear cut rules to minimize the insanity.

Leash rule. Unless your dog is in your office with either the door closed or the area blocked off, consider asking each dog owner to have their dog leashed in order to minimize any chances the dogs could fight or run away.
Inspect offices. Many dogs will eat virtually anything so have each employee inspect their office for any poisonous plant and foods that are bad for dogs, hanging electrical cords or any small items a dog may want to chew or eat.
Ask each pet owner to come prepared. This means employees should bring dog food, bowls, treats, toys and even bedding. Additionally, ask owners to bring a pooper scooper and baggies to remove waste from your grounds. Also, pet owners should bathe and groom their dogs before the big day at work to minimize shedding and bad odors.
Inquire about each dog’s temperament. Some dogs may love to interact with other dogs and humans, whereas others may become frightened or even aggressive. If an employee has a dog that has emotional issues, ask the employee to leave the dog at home and bring pictures and videos of the dog to prevent trauma for the dog.

, In addition to providing employees with enough time to get their pup ready to come to work, promote your support for local animal rescue efforts.

Send emails and post flyers. Depending on how your company communication works, send a detailed memo or email describing why you plan to celebrate the day, what each employee can do to support the cause and rules and regulations surrounding pets at work.
Find fun ways to celebrate employees’ dogs. From inviting a photographer to take family pet photos or holding a cutest dog contest to holding a doggie relay or dress up, consider adding a fun event that involves both dog and owner.
Choose a slower time during the day to have a dog party. Pick up a dog-friendly cake from a local dog bakery along with snacks and plenty of water to celebrate and mark the day.
Set up an area in your office to accommodate your sponsor organization. Depending on how you plan to sponsor your dog rescue or adoption organization, set up a designated area for rescue professionals to disseminate information and/or keep animals on-site for adoption.

, Pin photos of each dog participant and employees on a bulletin board to remind everyone of what fun the day was. Add photos to online newsletters or the Internet. Try to keep the connection with dogs alive in everyone's minds - you just never know, this may become a more regular event than once a year!

Find a time for lunch if you don't have a regular lunch hour.,
Have a system in place for others to deal with your absence.,
Mix things up regularly.",How to Make the Most of a Lunch Hour1," If you don't have a set lunch hour or break time, figure out a gap in your schedule where you can take 30 minutes or an hour off to have lunch. For example, if you're a student, see if you have regular breaks between classes sometime in the afternoon. Plan to eat lunch between economics and math class.


Think about your personal appetite as well. When do you tend to get hungry? If your hunger tend to spike later in the day, for example, plan on a late lunch break.;
, It can be hard to unwind if you're worried about people needing you. Make sure people at your office know when you'll be gone, how to contact you in the event of an emergency, and who to talk to in your place if you're unavailable., A schedule can be great and keep you on track, but don't get stuck in a rut. This can result in your lunch break feeling routine and boring. Make slight changes on occasion.For example, if you normally go to a particular diner for lunch, choose a different diner. If you usually run errands during lunch, take a break to read a book instead one day.

"
"
Bring a lunch from home.,
Eat a quality meal.,
Ditch the screens.,
Take a walk.,
Practice mindfulness.,
Take a short nap.",How to Make the Most of a Lunch Hour2," Usually, it's more economical to bring your lunch from home. This can also help you make the most of lunch as it cuts down on waiting times. You will be able to eat as soon as lunch break hits instead of waiting at a restaurant or fast food place.

, What you eat at lunch matters. If you're loading up on unhealthy foods, you won't go back to the office or school recharged and refreshed. Instead of eating sugar or processed carbs, load up on healthy fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins to energize yourself midday.For protein, try healthy options like fish, nuts, and seeds.
Try healthy fruits and vegetables like carrots, greens, avocados, blueberries, and carrots.
If you eat something like a sandwich for lunch, opt for whole wheat bread.

, Social media, e-mail, and other things you can access via your phone can be stressful. Also, if you stare at a screen at work, your eyes usually need a break. Power down your phone, or at least avoid looking at it, during your lunch break.However, if there's something you want to do on break that requires your phone, use it if necessary. Just get up and walk while you're using your phone so your brain perceives this action as a break.

, After eating your lunch, take a brief walk around the block. Getting a little exercise in, even just a 10 minute walk, can help you unwind and recharge before entering the office.If you can walk in a more rural setting, do so. Exposing yourself to nature can help reduce stress levels.
If you can't go outside, walk around the hallways of your office or school.

, Mindfulness is a means to fully engage with the present moment. Find a quiet spot and focus on your physical sensations. Stay in the present moment by being hyperaware of yourself and your surroundings and paying attention to mundane things, like the pattern of your breath.Mindfulness can be challenging. As the mind is a busy place, it can be difficult to focus entirely on the present at first. However, if you practice mindfulness for a few minutes during your lunch hour each day, it will eventually get easier.

, A brief 20 minute nap can help you recharge and go into work feeling refreshed. After eating, try sleeping with your head on your desk. Set a timer to make sure you don't sleep for more than a 20 minute period. A short nap can sharpen your awareness for the rest of the day.For comfort, use something like a jacket or a soft purse as you pillow.
Make sure not to sleep more than 20 minutes. Naps should either be 20 minutes long or 60 to 90 minutes long. Anything between these time frames will only make you feel groggy.
Make sure napping is okay. In some offices, it may be frowned upon, even if you're napping during your lunch hour.

Reassess and re-prioritize your day.,
Interact with someone new in the office.,
Squeeze in errands you can't do at other times.",How to Make the Most of a Lunch Hour3," Your lunch hour is a great time to think about how to tackle the rest of your day. After working hard all day, take your lunch hour to look over what you need to do and form a game plan.Look at your task list for the rest of the day. What still needs to be done and what should take priority? If you use a to-do list daily, tweak it during your lunch hour. Mark off items you've completed and push items around as necessary.

, See lunch as an invaluable networking opportunity. Make plans to grab lunch with a co-worker you do not know well. Branching out and meeting other people at the office can be advantageous to your career later on., Sometimes, small errands can be quickly taken care of during your lunch hour. If there are talks you can only complete during the afternoon hours, take a few minutes during your lunch hour to do them. For example, if your pharmacy closes after you get out of work, pick up a prescription during your lunch hour.However, do not run errands every day. Remember that it's important to take breaks and unwind as well.

Be consistent and patient.",How to Build Cardio Stamina when You Have Asthma," This may be the most important step you can take before doing cardio workouts if you suffer from asthma. Doctors can help you figure out which activities are best for your particular condition. They will also help you understand what to do if you have an asthma attack while you are exercising.


If you’re planning to change your exercise routine, talk to your doctor. They might want to adjust your asthma medication accordingly.;
, In particular, look for high pollution days. If poor air quality tends to set off your asthma, stay indoors on those days. If you must exercise outdoors, reduce the amount of time you work out on days with high pollution. You might also want to wear a mask on those days.

, For many asthma sufferers, the outdoors is full of triggers such as pollen and air pollution. If you can find activities you enjoy indoors, these are usually the safest option. That doesn’t mean you can never exercise outside, just that you may have to be extra careful. , Particularly if cold air tends to trigger your attacks, you need to protect your lungs. It might be best to do your cardio workouts indoors in the winter, but if you can’t, then cover up. , Particularly if you have a virus such as a cold, this isn’t the best time to exercise. Vigorous exercise when you’re sick can lower your immunity too.


If you feel like you must get up and about, consider a short walk instead of intense exercise. You could also do something very low-key like a simple yoga routine. It’s also a good idea to get a flu shot if you suffer from asthma. , People with asthma are often particularly reluctant to do cardio exercise because of the fear of an attack. If this is the case, find ways to motivate yourself to undertake cardio exercise. Make yourself a calendar or sticker chart. Every day that you get in a bit of cardio (even if it’s only a little), add a check or sticker.
Reward yourself. As soon as you meet a cardio goal, give yourself a treat. Maybe a new pair of tennis shoes or some fancy yoga pants to inspire you to work out more!
Find a buddy. Having a friend to join you in a workout is often very motivating and more fun than exercising alone.

, If you’re on a sports team, be sure your coach and the other players know what to do if you have an attack. If you’re working with a trainer, be sure they know which exercises you can and cannot do. If you work out with a buddy, make sure they can also recognize the symptoms of an attack and help you if you get into trouble.If you have a medical ID bracelet, be sure to wear it when you’re doing cardio exercises. For competitive sports, alert referees and other officials who might be concerned about “jewelry” on the playing field ahead of time.

, Cold, dry air going into your lungs causes airway constriction. For this reason, cold weather sports such as skiing, ice skating, and ice hockey are often a problem, so talk to your doctor if you’re interested in these sports.Many people with asthma enjoy water-based sports such as


lap swimming
water polo
synchronized swimming
water aerobics

, Activities that require you to run for long periods of time often aren’t the best idea for people with asthma. There are a variety of sports and activities that allow you to take a break frequently.Consider


volleyball
gymnastics
baseball and softball
football
wrestling
yoga
golfing
racquet sports
walking
short distance running

, Activities like these are often a challenge for people with asthma, but that doesn't mean they're impossible. By following your doctor’s instructions, taking your medicine as directed, warming up and cooling down properly, people with asthma CAN be successful at endurance sports such as


soccer
cross-country running
basketball
lacrosse
field hockey

, Many people with asthma use an inhaler (often albuterol) before they work out. If your doctor has prescribed a medicine like this for you, be careful to use it as directed. If they haven’t prescribed something like this, check with them to see if you need one. Typically, you should use your pre-exercise medicine about 10 minutes before exerting yourself. Some require 15-20 minutes to kick in, so read the instructions carefully., This is particularly important with exercise-induced asthma. You may need to show up to practice a few minutes early to fit this in if you’re on a sports team. Researchers recommend 30 second sprints as an interval warm-up.


Sprint as fast as you can for 30 seconds.
Rest anywhere from 45 seconds to 5 minutes. Be sure you’re breathing normally before continuing.
Repeat, doing a total of 8-10 sprints in all.
Start exercising about 15-20 minutes after the interval warm-up. , Work on breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth as you exercise. Try to keep your breaths as even as possible. You may want to practice steady, even breathing on a treadmill or brisk walk if you are anticipating trying a new sport. That will help you get used to breathing right before you jump into a baseball or volleyball game.

, If you experience wheezing, chest tightness, coughing, or shortness of breath, take a break. If any of these symptoms become uncontrollable, follow the asthma plan you have developed with your doctor.

, If you find yourself experiencing symptoms such as wheezing, gasping, chest tightness, trouble speaking, chest or stomach ache, stop exercising and use the inhaler immediately. If you find that your symptoms get worse, follow whatever asthma attack routine your doctor has advised., A good cool down routine will help regulate your heart rate. Simply slow the pace of whatever exercise you’re doing for the last 5-10 minutes of your workout. Don’t shift gears and do a completely new kind of exercise; just make whatever you were already doing a bit simpler.If you were running, slow down to a jog for the last 5-10 minutes.
If you were jogging, slow down to a walk for the last 5-10 minutes.
Include some deep, regular breaths as part of your cool down.

, The best way to build cardio stamina is to keep working at it over time. Try to get at least 20 minutes of cardio exercise 3 times a week. Don’t overdo it, but do keep working at it. Building cardiovascular strength takes time, and asthma can slow down this process. Do what you can until you become uncomfortable, and then try to do a little more the next day.

Do reverse sit-ups with an exercise ball.,
Do a reverse plank with an exercise ball.,
Do Pilates roll-ups with an exercise ball.,
Do leg crosses with an exercise ball.,
Do a lying leg rotation with an exercise ball.",How to Do Core Exercises1," This exercise is similar to performing basic crunches. Instead of placing your feet on the floor, you rest your feet on the top of an exercise ball. This engages your lower abdominals because you will have to work to keep the ball stable as you perform the exercise. However, this exercise primarily targets your upper abdominals.;
, To make this exercise more challenging, add individual leg lifts while you are in the plank position. You can also try the regular plank and the side plank as variations on this exercise.

, This exercise will challenge both your lower and upper abdominal muscles. As you gain control, try to keep your legs still. Use your abdominal muscles to pull yourself up rather than using momentum from your hip flexors and lumbar spine to roll your body into a sitting position. If you can’t raise yourself from the floor into a sitting position at first, place a small stability ball or a cushion under your back until you become stronger.

, These leg crosses will work your oblique muscles, which are the muscles that run down the sides of your abdomen. Keep your glutes and your hamstrings engaged throughout to give yourself added stability and to keep your movement fluid. You’ll also feel engagement in your lower abdominal muscles.

, Use slow movements during this exercise and engage your abdominals so that you don’t injure your back. Try to keep your arms and your upper body as still as possible while you rotate your lower body to either side.

Do an upward facing hip flex .,
Do side to side crunches.,
Perform the medicine ball sit-up exercise.",How to Do Core Exercises2," The leg extension exercises in this article keep one foot on the ground. To make this exercise more challenging, start with both knees bent at a 90-degree angle so that your thighs are perpendicular to the floor and your calves are parallel to the floor. Extend one leg, pull the leg back in, and then extend the other leg. To make the exercise even more intense, lower your legs until they almost touch the floor.

, During this exercise, you’ll need to keep your abdominals engaged to avoid putting too much strain on your back. This exercise adds the benefit of working your glutes and thigh muscles as well as your core. Keep your hips on the ground while gently doing the rotation to create a nice stretch in your spinal column.

, This article teaches you to do the hip flex with alternating legs while lying on your back on a floor mat. To increase the challenge, try performing the same exercise while you are balanced on a Roman chair. Also, you can lift both legs at the same time. Lift your pelvis off of the floor for an even deeper abdominal workout.

, To isolate your obliques during this exercise, imagine that you are trying to touch your hip with the opposite shoulder as you crunch inward. You can increase the challenge by raising your legs at a 90-degree angle during the crunches, or you can perform the crunches on a decline bench. You can also lift the opposite leg off of the floor as you contract your abs and pull your shoulder across your body.

, Performed with a partner, this exercise that involves the use of a medicine ball will add an extra dimension to your core workout. To make the exercise more challenging, you can use a heavier medicine ball or sit further apart. Make sure that you upper back comes all the way to the floor between sit-ups. Otherwise, your abdominal muscles may be only isometrically involved.

Do the “hundred” exercise in Pilates.,
Do an open leg rocker in Pilates.,
Do cris crosses in Pilates.,
Do the boomerang in Pilates.,
Do up down side kicks in Pilates.",How to Do Core Exercises3," The hundred is one of the core Pilates exercises. As you pump your arms, imagine yourself pushing down a pile of sand with your hands. You will do 5 inhalations and 5 exhalations per set for 10 sets, which is why the exercise is called the hundred.

, This exercise is more for the intermediate or advanced Pilates student. If you are not able to complete the rocking motion, then simply work on balancing yourself on your seat in the “V” position without rocking back and forth. When your core becomes stronger, then you can add the rocking motion to the exercise.

, Cris crosses are similar to side-to-side crunches except that your legs move into your body as you cross your upper body over. During this exercise, make sure to keep plenty of space between your shoulders and your ears. Do not scrunch your neck into your shoulders or lift your back up off of the floor. If needed, practice the movements without your legs elevated until you are strong enough to perform the exercise with the leg movement.

, As you roll up and down on your mat while doing this exercise, try to think of yourself raising and lowering one vertebra at a time. Switch crossed legs every other repetition to work both sides of your core equally. Again, some practice holding yourself in a “V” position might be necessary before fully engaging with this exercise.

, If lifting your leg to a 90-degree angle is challenging at first, then start by lifting your leg to hip height and holding it in position before lowering it. Gradually increase the height of the lift as you grow more accustomed to the exercise. Imagine that a spring connects your ankle to the ceiling and that, as you raise and lower your leg, you are applying resistance against the spring. This will make your movement more fluid.

Assume the locust pose in yoga.,
Do the full boat pose in yoga.,
Do the peacock posture.,
Do the revolved half moon pose in yoga.,
Do the table pose in yoga.",How to Do Core Exercises4," The locust pose requires you to lift your chest and feet up off of the ground, using your core to stabilize your body. To give yourself added support, place your hands beneath your thighs with you palms facing upward. Use your fingers to push your legs up off of the floor until you become strong enough to keep your legs up without the added support.

, This yoga pose lifts your back and heels off of the ground, relying on your core to keep you stable and balanced. If you have difficulty lifting your feet, then wrap a strap around your arches and pull on the strap as you lift your back off of the ground. You can also have a partner press against your back so that your shoulder blades have something to push against as you raise your sternum.

, This exercise requires you to support your weight with your hands, but you actually use the core muscles to keep your body aligned as it lifts off of the ground. If you’re having difficulty keeping your elbows tucked in, then you can bind them together with a strap so that they better support your weight. You can also support your forehead or your ankles on a block or a cushion.

, Make sure that you have warmed up your core muscles before you perform this pose as it places a strong demand on your abdominals and lower back. If your hip isn’t strong enough to support your weight, then place some blocks under your shoulders and lean your extended leg against a wall to support your weight.

, In addition to strengthening both your core and your arms, the table pose provides a great stretch for the front of your body. This pose restores balance to your body after sports that require forward motion, like tennis or swimming. It also counteracts the effects of a day spent hunched over a computer at work.

, You're not going to enjoy Aqua Zumba if you aren't comfortable in a pool. If you've never taken a Zumba class before and aren't familiar with it, you might want to watch a few videos online to decide whether Aqua Zumba is right for you.Generally, if you find yourself dancing along to your favorite songs, you probably will enjoy Zumba. This form of exercise incorporates dance moves from all over the world, performed to the energetic beats of international music.
The moves in Aqua Zumba, however, are slow and exaggerated compared to your usual dance moves. For this reason, you should be able to pick it up relatively easily, even if you're not very coordinated.

, Taking a moment to think about your fitness goals can help you figure out if Aqua Zumba is the right thing to help you achieve those goals. This is important if you plan to make Aqua Zumba a regular part of your fitness regimen.Make sure your goals are specific and measurable. If you want to do Aqua Zumba because you want to be healthier, or want to lose weight, those are fine starting points. However, making them more specific will enable you to evaluate your progress and see results.
For example, you might set the goal that you want to lose 5 pounds in 5 weeks (1 – 2 pounds of weight-loss is considered safe). Or your goal might be to go to Aqua Zumba twice a week for the next three months.
Ideally, you want to fit Aqua Zumba into a healthy lifestyle, which may require you to make other changes first. For example, if you are a smoker, you may want to work on quitting smoking before you start any intense cardio workout like Aqua Zumba.

, Before you start any new exercise program, you want to make sure that you are physically capable of performing the moves. This is particularly important if you have a chronic medical condition or if you are still recovering from a recent injury.Due to the low-impact nature of Aqua Zumba, this type of exercise is generally safe for people with arthritis or other joint problems. However, your doctor will be able to give you a more personal assessment of your capabilities.
Be sure to tell your doctor if you have any particular concerns, and ask questions to get the doctor's opinion on how this program will effect you.

, Unless you live in a small town or rural area, you'll likely have several options to choose from when it comes to taking an Aqua Zumba class. You can research online to find classes near you.Consider time and location. You want to make sure the class you choose is relatively convenient for you, and that you'll be able to get there on time for each class session.
You also want to keep your budget in mind, in terms of both time and money. Some places may allow drop-in or walk-in students so you can pay for each class as you go, while others will want you to pay for several classes up front. Some locations also may be more expensive than others, so find a class for which you have the time and money to commit.

, Once you've narrowed down your choices, try to take the time to meet with several different instructors. You want to ask questions and get to know them a little so you can choose an instructor with whom you're comfortable.Make sure the instructor is qualified, and ask if they have a current group fitness instructor certification or any other specialty certifications. Learn about their background, including how long they've been teaching Zumba and Aqua Zumba classes.
It also is important that the instructor be somebody with whom you feel comfortable and motivates you to work out. Ask them questions about their teaching and coaching style, and consider their personality. While it isn't necessary for you to want to become best friends with your fitness instructor, you're not going to get much out of your class if you find them annoying or abrasive.

, Especially if you have no experience with Zumba or Aqua Zumba, it may be beneficial for you to sit in on a class so you can become more familiar with the moves and the general atmosphere of the class.After the class, set aside time to talk to a few of the people in the class about their experience with Aqua Zumba. Observe the interaction between the people in the class and the instructor, as well as with each other.
Sitting in on a class will help you familiarize yourself with the program so you'll be more comfortable on your first day. It also gives you a chance to tour the facilities so you'll know where everything is.

, Since Aqua Zumba takes place in a pool, you'll need the proper attire. If you're uncomfortable in a swimsuit, you may want to contact the pool where your class will take place to find out what other options are available.While many pools don't allow you to wear a T-shirt or other street clothes in the pool, you may be able to wear a wetsuit, which provides more coverage.
You're going to be twisting, turning, and jumping around a lot, so make sure the swimsuit you wear will move with you comfortably. If you have to constantly adjust it or worry about it, you won't be able to get as much out of the class.
You also may want to wear a pair of water shoes. They can help you maintain your grip on the floor of the pool and keep you from slipping., For your first class, it's generally a good idea to show up for class at least 15 to 20 minutes early – especially if you've never used those facilities before. This will give you a chance to get ready and talk to the instructor before class starts.Introduce yourself to the instructor and let them know that it's your first class. They may have some tips for you or other information to get you started on the right foot.
Getting there a little early allows you to get ready for class without rushing, so you're starting from a calm, relaxed state.

, To get the most out of your Aqua Zumba workout, the water should come up to your arm pits. A higher water level may cause you to struggle, while a lower water level won't give you the resistance you need.You also want to think about the location of the instructor when you choose your spot in the pool. Will you be able to see and hear? This is especially important if you normally wear glasses or contacts but are taking them out while in the pool — you want to be where you can see the instructor clearly.
Since the instructor leads the class from the pool deck, be sure to stand back far enough so you don't have to look up the whole class, as this could hurt your neck.
For your first few classes, the best place for you to be may be front and center, so you can concentrate on the instructor and are less distracted by the other people in the class.

, In Aqua Zumba classes, the instructor is out of the water at the edge of the pool, so you can see their full body and how you're supposed to move in the water. All you have to do is follow their lead.Aqua Zumba movements are a little slower than in regular Zumba classes, as well as a little less complex, so you shouldn't have any trouble keeping up.
Keep in mind that it may take you a couple of classes to get used to working out in the water, especially if you've never done any sort of water aerobics before. Be kind to yourself and give yourself time to acclimate to the new situation.

, While it may take a few classes for you to find the right balance, ideally you want to control the water and your movements in it. Focus on pushing through the water toward the bottom of the pool, not fighting against it.Aqua Zumba classes use water for a low-impact resistance workout. Over time, you'll not only improve your cardiovascular fitness but also get better muscle tone.
One way this is done is by pushing the water. The instructor may demonstrate arm movements that should be done under water, or cup their hands to indicate that you should push the water away from you.
Keep in mind that Aqua Zumba is a total-body workout. Keep your muscles engaged and work with, not against, the water.

, People who are close to the earth and respect the earth respect it's creatures too, respect every living thing and don't kill natures wonderful creatures.


A pescatarian is a person who does not eat meat but does eat fish. A vegetarian is a person who does not eat meat or seafood but does eat eggs and dairy. A vegan is a person who does not eat any animal products whatsoever.

, Be mindful of the environment, this earth is the only one we have. Why kill it off? You can help in small ways by using the three R's: reduce, reuse, and recycle! You can also plant trees.

, Wear flowing dresses skirts and tops. The main colors a forest nymph would wear are brown and green or other natural looking colors, a forest nymph would never wear bright or neon clothes unless they're yellow (that represents the sun). Nymphs are very passive so neutral colors like white and earthy tones are good too.

, Forest nymphs are strong and active so take up a sport and exercise, but don't push yourself too hard. Become active little by little until you achieve you goal.

, Being able to climb trees well is a great way to be a nymph. Nymphs are known to jump out of trees and scare people, don't give someone a heart attack but make sure to learn how to jump from higher branches, make sure not to hurt yourself, start low down and gradually get higher up the tree. Remember, nymphs are not invincible so be sensible and careful and don't try to jump from too high up.

, Nymphs are always themselves, they are usually shy but there can be odd nymphs out too. Don't be afraid to be you!

Figure out how much time you’ll need.,
Build a schedule.,
Check prerequisites.,
Look for badges your troop isn’t working on.,
Do a little badge work every day.,
Finish multiple requirements at once.,
Attend camps and jamborees.,
Read the pamphlet.,
Find a merit badge counselor.,
Work with a buddy.,
Fulfill the requirements.",How to Get All of Your Boy Scout Merit Badges," Every merit badge has different requirements, which includes the amount of time you’ll need to complete all of them. Some badges you can finish in an afternoon, while others take several months of tracking information before you have fulfilled the requirements.


For example, Personal Management (an Eagle-required badge) requires you to track your income, expenses, and savings for 13 consecutive weeks, which is about 3 months.Your parents or Scoutmaster are good resources for discussing a merit badge schedule. They will be able to help you figure out the best times to do certain badges, and help you stay on course for your Scouting goals.;
, The best way to accomplish any goal, like earning every available merit badge, is to give yourself a schedule. Rather than thinking about earning every badge at once, focus on earning a couple at a time. Breaking your quest into smaller, more manageable goals, will help you chip away at it while keeping a feeling of real progress.When you look at setting a schedule, consider what kinds of equipment or settings you will need to complete each badge. A badge like Water Sports will probably need to be completed in warmer months, when you can be on the water, while winter might be better for a badge that involves more indoor work like Reading.
Badges that require a lot of time for their requirements, like Personal Management, don’t necessarily ask that you spend a lot of time each day on it.You can work on multiple badges at once, so look for other, shorter badges to work on while you do longer requirements for others.
As of the start of 2016, there are currently 136 merit badges offered through the Boy Scouts. If you work at a pace of 5 badges per month, you can complete all badges in a little more than three years., Some badges will require you to have completed other requirements before you begin working on the badge. Look for badges that require you to know information from other ranks, and wait to start working on those badges until after you have achieved that rank.


First Aid (an Eagle-required badge) asks that you have knowledge of all first aid requirements for ranks up through First Class. You don’t necessarily need to be First Class to get it, but it can help to check off one of the requirements once you get started., Most troops will spend time working on badges to help Scouts advance. If your troop is going to be working on specific badges, it would be best not to spend time on those on your own.


In 2014, Eagle-required badges made up the top 13 merit badges earned. Other high-ranking badges included Rifle Shooting, Fingerprinting, Archery, Leatherwork, and Wilderness Survival. These are badges your troop will probably work on, either as a group or at summer camp.

, Earning every merit badge will take some time. To help you get through that, set aside a little bit of your time. Establishing a daily routine is a good skill to learn, as it will help you push through the days when you feel less like working, and make it more likely that you will accomplish any goal you set.You can be flexible with how much time you spend each day. Some requirements will take more than your allotted time, others less. The important thing is that you get into the habit of carving out at least some time every day.
Don’t let badge work get in the way of other important things like school and family time.

, Look for requirements that are the same or similar between badges. Many requirements and regulations allow you to double count activities if there is significant overlap.Be aware of subtle differences between requirements. Both Communication and Citizenship in the Community have you attend a local public meeting and listen to different opinions on an issue. Communication then asks you to carefully report on each point of view, while Citizenship in the Community asks you to take a side on the issue. The same meeting can start both requirements, but each needs a slightly different end result.
A number of badges have some kind of reading or writing piece to them. If you can find ways to make your school assignments fit into your merit badge requirements, that’s a great way to check off requirements while also getting your schoolwork done.
The Scout Guide asks you to consider why you are double-counting activities. Checking off requirements is important, but you should also consider the possibility that the extra effort may make a greater difference in the lives of others. It is ultimately a personal decision, but something that you should at least think about.

, A big part of Scouting events is the opportunity to earn several merit badges quickly. Camps and jamborees will provide a variety of classes for earning your badges during the week you are there.When thinking about what badges you want to earn, look for things that you can’t easily do at home. An outdoor camp is a great opportunity for something like Wilderness Survival or Pioneering. You may find more unique opportunities to work with people in specific areas like Nuclear Science or Pottery that you won’t necessarily meet at home or through your troop.
If the camp gives prerequisites for any of merit badge courses you want to take, make sure you do them before you go. Also keep an eye out for anything the course says you will need to complete after camp is over.
If your troop doesn’t attend a regular summer camp, talk to your Scoutmaster about finding one nearby that you can go to. Even if you and the other scouts don’t earn merit badges, summer camp is a great time for building troop spirit and doing other fun activities., Every merit badge has a pamphlet that includes the requirements and lists a number of resources you can consult to learn more. Make sure the badge is something you can, and want to, accomplish. Talk to your Scoutmaster, or check the BSA’s website, to get pamphlets for the badge you want to earn.The national organization will make changes to the requirements for badges, as well as create new ones and retire old ones. Make sure you have the most up-to-date requirements for when you start trying to earn the badge.

, For each badge, you will need someone trained or experienced in the field who can help teach you the badge’s skills. The counselor will try to figure out what you do or do not know about the topic, and teach you the skills you need. He will also be the one to sign off that you have completed the requirements to earn the badge.If you are trying to earn a badge that requires particular equipment, like Astronomy or Rifle Shooting, the counselor should have access to that equipment, and a place to use it correctly.
While your troop will probably have, or know, a number of qualified people to help, you may need to track down counselors for some of your badges.

, Your buddy can either be a family member, friend, relative, or better yet, another scout. You are not required to have another scout with you, as stated in 7.0.3.1 of the 2015 BSA Guide to advancement. Some of your work may need to be done independently, but it is always good to have someone else there to watch you doing the work.While you really only need one buddy, it can always be more fun with a larger group. Getting a few Scouts together to learn a new skill or earn a merit badge can be a fun activity for a troop or patrol., After you have read the requirements, get to work! Complete every step required for the badge, and show your work to the merit badge counselor. If you think you have already completed several steps before meeting with the counselor, bring that stuff as well so he can decide if it counts.


Depending on the badge, you may need the counselor to explain how something works before you go about doing your project, or you may need his approval to get started. For Photography, for example, your counselor must approve the story you intend to tell with pictures before you get started.You don’t want to do all that work only to find out it won’t count.
Once you are finished, your merit badge counselor will sign off on your merit badge application. Turn that in to your Scoutmaster, and you will have earned the merit badge. Congratulations!

Network with other troop leaders.",How to Start and Manage a Daisy Girl Scout Troop," To start, you'll be required to complete an online training program, Girl Scout Training 101, that takes around 45 minutes. This goes over the basics of Girl Scouts and your responsibilities as a troop leader.How you access the online training varies by state. You usually have to create an account on the national Girl Scouts website. However, some local troops may provide general access information that can be used by anyone interested in becoming a troop leader.The easiest way to figure out regulations in your state is to reach out to an active Girl Scout leader in your area. As requirements vary widely, you want to make sure you understand your state's specific requirements for completing the online training session before moving forward.
Pay close attention during the online training session. It will be a combination of video and text overviewing the basics of managing a troop. You'll want to take notes throughout the training session, as this information will be invaluable later on when you're managing your own troop.;
, All Daisy Troop leaders must undergo a criminal background check. This is to assure you do not have a criminal history and are fit to supervise young children. You can submit a form agreeing to a criminal background check online, through the national Girl Scouts website.


You will enter some basic contact information, like your name and address. You will then be brought to a screen that contains a few paragraphs. These paragraphs basically say you're agreeing to a criminal background check that will look over your legal and driving history.By submitting the form, you're authorizing investigators to perform the background check. In order to consent to the background check, you must be at least 18 years of age.There may be a small fee for the background check, usually around $15. You may be able to waive the fee by instead making a donation to the Girl Scouts organization., From here, you will need to take a Leader 101 course. This is a two hour training seminar that introduces you to the basics of managing a Girl Scout Troop. Your local branch of Girl Scouts should be able to let you know when the next Leader 101 course will be hosted in your area. Depending on your local branch of Girl Scouts, you may have to sign up online or in person.


Leader 101 will go over the basics of troop management and also talk about the values of Girl Scouts as an organization. In addition to learning basic facts, like logistics for cookie sales and how to start a bank account, you'll also learn about the values of the Girl Scouts organization.
You will also learn about how to order materials for your troop. To start a Girl Scouts troop, you'll need items like vests, badges, and so on. How you obtain these items, and the funds provided, varies by location. You should learn about the regulations of your specific location at Leader 101.

, In order to manage a troop, you must be a member of the Girl Scouts of the USA. Many troop leaders were girl scouts as kids, so there's a good chance you're already a member. If you're not, however, make sure to register online.


You simply go to the Girl Scout website and click the green ""Join Us"" button. From here, you'll enter basic information and may have to answer a few questions about why you're joining Girl Scouts.
You will have to pay a $15 registration fee. As long as your criminal background check goes through, you should be accepted as a member of Girl Scouts of the USA. This means you'll now be able to start your own Daisy Troop.

, Many local branches of girl scouts require you select a co-leader for your troop. The co-leader must also be a member of Girl Scouts of the USA. You can select a co-leader from people you met at training sessions. If you are a former girl scout starting a troop, you may already have a friend signed on as your co-leader. Make sure you pick someone you feel you can work with well on a semi-professional basis.

, After completing training, you should have all the knowledge you need to start your troop. You'll want to begin by recruiting members from your community. Remember, Daisies are kindergartners and first grade students.


If you or your co-leader has a daughter in Kindergarten or first grade, you can start here. Talk to your daughter's teacher and ask him or her if you can come talk to the class about Girl Scouts. You can ask girls who are interested to talk to their parents after school.
You can also create flyers to hang up around schools, daycares, and community centers. These can be advertised at both children and parents. You may be able to get flyers directly from your local branch of Girl Scouts.
When recruiting members, focus on the positive aspects of Girl Scouts. Talk about the commitment to confidence, togetherness, service, and responsibility. Talk to parents about how joining Girl Scouts can boost a young girl's self-esteem, help her make lifelong friends, and help her develop basic skills like responsibility.Let parents know who is eligible to be a girl scout. Parents of transgender children may wonder if their daughters are allowed in Girl Scouts. Reassure these parents that Girl Scouts is open to transgender girls who are recognized as female by their families and communities. You should also make it clear that Girl Scouts is open to families of any religious background., As you begin to generate interest, you will need to find a location and time to host troop meetings. Troops can meet a churches, schools, or community centers. As you're working with school-aged children, select a meeting time that's convenient for children and parents. Make sure meeting times occur after school. Keep in mind many parents work a 9 to 5 job. A meeting that runs until a little after 5 can be convenient, as parents can pick up their kids after work.Talk to your local branch of Girl Scouts while selecting a meeting location. You will need to get your troop number, assigned by the local branch, and have them approve your meeting location.
A school is probably the easiest place to host meetings, as girls can go directly from school to their girl scout meeting. Most schools will be willing to accommodate wholesome after-school activities like Girl Scouts.

, Before you can have an official Girl Scouts meeting, you'll need to have what is called a parent/guardian meeting. This is an event where you meet with parents and guardians of potential troop members. This allows you to answer any questions parents or guardians may have regarding a Daisy Troop. You can help build community support for your troop by working with parents and guardians.


To start, you'll need to inform parents and guardians about the Girl Scouts and their values. You can also recruit parents to volunteer, as you'll need assistance with supervision, clean-up, and other aspects of troop meetings.There are a variety of forms, such as the Health Examination Form, you need to have parents complete before their kids can join your troop. The parent/guardian meeting is the place to hand out these forms and answer any questions regarding them. Your local branch of Girl Scouts will keep you up-to-date on what forms are needed.Spend a lot of time planning your first parent/guardian meeting. You want to make sure parents and guardians leave the meeting excited about their girls joining a Daisy Troop. Supportive, active parents and guardians are vital to a successful Daisy Troop., Once you've hosted your first parents meeting, you can host your first troop meeting at your chosen location. You should plan a basic arts and crafts event to help your girls get to know each other and begin to bond.


You can browse the Girl Scout website for ideas on opening day craft activities. Choose a craft that promotes communication and can be used for icebreaking. For example, the girls can each draw pictures of their favorite things. They can then exchange pictures with other members and compare and contrast tastes.
You can start the meeting by getting your troops in a circle. You can have them introduce themselves. You can consider playing a game to help with introductions. Some Daisy Troop leaders play a game like ""Duck, duck, goose!"" but instead call it, ""Daisy, daisy, petal!""
You should also strive to introduce the basics of a Daisy meeting. There will be a variety of handouts you should have received during your own training that overview a year as Girl Scout Daisy. Daisy Troops are guided by fictional characters, named Chandra, Cora, and Campbell, who appear in literature and pamphlets throughout the year. You can spend your first day learning a bit about these characters.

, All girl scout troops are required to have a bank account. This is where you'll store the funds raised through cookie sales and other troop activities. Your local branch of Girl Scouts should have their own regulations regarding establishing a bank account. You should be able to start your bank account by filling out some forms and submitting them to your local branch of Girl Scouts. The forms will vary by location, but you'll usually put down your troop number, your name, the address of your meetings, and other basic contact information. If you have any questions, you can ask other Girl Scouts troop leaders in your area. Rules regarding establishing a bank account in your area are covered during your training., The Daisy Troops follow a specific journey through a metaphorical garden in the course of the year. Meetings all build up to a project, called the ""Take Action Project,"" designed to nurture the metaphorical garden. This project can take a variety of directions, depending on your area and the interests of your troop. Try to incorporate a variety of activities into each meeting that build towards a larger project.The idea of the ""Take Action"" project is to try and make an impact on the community. You can have the girls, for example, help plant a community garden. You can work up to the larger project by having small planting projects each week. One week, for example, your girls can plant a small seed in a tiny pot. They can take it home, water it, and observe its growth. This will teach them basic gardening techniques they can use later on, when working in a community garden.The Girl Scouts of the USA provides a handbook which includes a sample trajectory of a year of a Daisy Troop. You can refer to this handbook as you plan your meetings, but feel free to deviate from the rules to suit your own troop's needs., You can take your troop on a variety of trips throughout the year. They can go to an organic farm, for example, to learn about environmental sustainability. Regulations for planning trips vary between branches of Girl Scouts. You may have to complete a 20 minute online training session, ""Traveling Troops,"" to go over regulations in your area. Make sure you plan at least a couple of trips throughout the year, all of which should relate to your ""Take Action"" project., The Girl Scouts have no set age limit for camping trips. As long as you feel your troop is ready for an overnight trip, you can go ahead and plan one with the support of parents. For camping, you want to have a basic safety class ahead of time to make sure your girls are prepared.You can incorporate a variety of activities into a camping trip depending on where you're staying. If you have a friend who owns a farm, for example, you can camp there and teach the girls about horseback riding, animal care, and farming in general. If you're camping near water, you can take the girls canoeing or teach them about swimming. If you are planning water activities, make sure to hire a professional lifeguard.
It's not uncommon for girls, especially girls who are in the Daisy age range, to feel nervous about camping for the first time. You can help your girls feel less nervous by going over the schedule extensively ahead of time. You can also visit the campgrounds before the overnight stay, so the girl's don't go in without any knowledge of where they're staying.

, Remember, Girl Scouts is a community. Take advantage of the community in your area. Network with other troop leaders. You can do collaborative projects with other Daisy Troops. You can also network with older Girl Scouts. Allowing your girls to see the projects and activities older Girl Scouts are engaging in may provide them with incentive to stay in Girl Scouts.

Breathe to self calm.",How to Survive Your First Year in Color Guard," Before you even try out for color guard, you need to be aware of all that goes into it, and you need to decide if this is something that you will enjoy. Many people go into color guard without even knowing what it is all about. If you enjoy dancing, being a part of a team, and can endure long practices, this is perfect for you!;
, Believe it or not, color guard is a sport. They go to competitions with the band, and even do competitions on their own as ""winter guard"". The best thing you can do before even trying out is to develop your endurance. You can do this simply by jogging then running if you are not already in shape. Now, it is not required by most color guards that you are physically fit, but it will help you so much during all of the practices and games. Another thing to do is to strengthen your wrists. Without strong wrists, you could possibly get them injured by all of the flag work and have to wear a brace for a while.

, Before you are in color guard, you will obviously need to try out for it. Don't be afraid to audition if you don't know the basics of flag. The typical way they do auditions is take four days to teach you the basics of flag work and teach you a short dance routine. On the fifth day, they will have you audition with a few other girls by doing what they taught you to do. The main thing they are looking for is not if you do it perfectly, but if you are teachable and really care about being in color guard.

, So you made the team? Good for you! Now the hard part begins....practice. For the first few weeks, typically during the summer, you will be practicing basics and developing endurance. This is usually done separate from the rest of the band until much later in the summer. Be prepared for some yelling and try not to let it bother you. Counting during routine run-thus will help you a lot.

, This is like practice x 100. After you have basically mastered the basics and have as much endurance as you are going to get, it is time to learn the routine for the show. That is what is done at band camp. There will be times when you are just with the color guard and times when you are learning positions on the field with the rest of the band. Make sure that you always have water, sunscreen, and a light snack on you. Another little warning for you, the very first time you do part of the routine with the band, don't let the drums or other instruments catch you by surprise.

, This is where the fun begins! After marching in, you will be in your own section of the stands with the band. This is just a fun time for color guard people because they don't have to worry about playing an instrument. There are usually little dances that you do in the stands while certain songs are played. If so, the older members of color guard will show you. Half time is your time to shine, so enjoy it! Many people get nervous when they first see all of the fans in the stands when they are on the field. Just remember that all of those people are just family, friends, and fellow students. You have worked too hard to not enjoy this!

, In this, you are basically doing the same thing as you would for a half time show, but you will need to pay a little more attention to details. Even things as simple as how you step or facial expressions will need to be considered. Many of these judges have been in the band world for quite a while and have an eye for details. Don't let this bother you though, just remember everything you have been taught. Also, if you run into some competition, don't be mean. Show some class by being nice to all of the competition.

, You may run into some drama along the way. Make sure you are not the one causing it. Even if you are really miffed at a fellow member, don't do something stupid like mess with their belongings. Not only will you get in trouble, but band directors like to punish the color guard as a whole so that the other members will make sure it doesn't happen again. If you are being bothered by someone else in the band and it is threatening you in any way, don't just allow it to continue. You need to either talk to the band director, color guard instructor, or your parents.

, Anyone can learn how to spin a piece of equipment. However, when breath is incorporated into the work you are given, it can make it much more consistent and graceful! Breathing also helps to calm you down, so whenever you have a chance to take a breath in between segments or right before a show, take deep and slow breaths to regain your calm. When you're nervous, you are much less likely to do well.

, It will make it much easier to work around the area; however, it will leave rusty staple marks/staples, depending upon the age and condition of the camper.

, If your canvas is attached in another way, undo that. You might find that you need to repeat this step later on if you don't unscrew enough of it.

, You don't need to remove it all, just the canvas near where you're installing the mount.

, Again, you only need to remove it starting from the corner, where it ends. If it's only stapled like in the Jayco 1207, you can remove it with a flat head screwdriver, using another handle as leverage. Use needlenose pliers and a small flat head screwdriver to remove the staples from the plastic.

, It goes behind the track and behind the canvas.

, Two feet (60cm) from the end of the camper works well, unless you want it to be closer to your A/C unit. Be sure to measure this distance and keep it the same for the mount on the other side of the camper.

Constant exposure to sunlight can cause severe sunburn, which can later lead to skin issues. Use a broad-spectrum (against UVA and UVB rays) sunscreen and lipscreen with at least SPF 15. Seek shade, especially during midday hours, when the sun’s rays are strongest. Be sure to follow directions on the package when applying bug repellant. Check for ticks daily, and if spotted, remove them immediately. Wear long sleeves, pants, and other light-colored clothing to help prevent insect bites. Avoid perfumes or colognes- these can attract stinging insects. If you are approached by a stinging insect, do not wave wildly and swat blindly. This will only anger them and make the situation worse. Instead, use a gentle pushing or brushing motion to make them go away. Wear sunglasses for extra protection from sunlight. The sun's harsh glare, which comes from it reflecting off surfaces such as water, boulders and snow, can cause eye damage if looked at for too long.
Put on sunscreen no matter the season. It doesn't matter how warm it is; you can still get sunburn in subfreezing temperatures. Sunlight is still harmful even if it is cloudy or snowing, it actually intensifies the sun rays.;
, In case of an emergency, first aid supplies can make a gigantic difference. Personalize your kit to meet your needs, activities and situations. What supplies to include and how much of each item should be based upon the needs of the camping trip and the probability of each situation that would require a first aid kit. Some of the recommended supplies include:


Personal medications, gauze, latex gloves, antiseptic wipes, cotton swabs, tweezers, tissues, sterile compresses, etc. There are many more options than this, however. Learn basic first aid as well. Know how to identify and treat injuries and illnesses. Learn how to identify the symptoms of heat exhaustion, heat stroke, hypothermia, dehydration and other illnesses, and know how to treat them. If necessary, take a first aid or CPR class. Keep your materials in a well marked, durable, waterproof container. Make sure to keep the contents organized, and know how to use everything in the kit.
Along with your first aid kit, bring emergency supplies. These include, but are not limited to: a map, compass, flashlight, knife, waterproof fire starter, whistle, warm clothing, high energy food, water, and insect protection.

, Before you leave, check the weather forecast, learn about security at your camp location, and tell family and friends your plans, such as where you intend to go, and when you plan on coming back. Be sure to bring along a supply kit that includes a first-aid kit, compass or GPS, map, flashlight, blankets, batteries, food, water, clothes, and medications
Know who to contact at the camp to report issues that may come up, and who to contact in case of an emergency. Always have a back up plan. When you return home, check for ticks, skin rashes or sunburn, dehydration, and other issues.

, Take healthy food along with you when you go camping. Eating contaminated food and drinking contaminated water can increase the risk of developing certain infectious diseases caused by germs, and can make you become seriously ill. This can be very dangerous if you are camping in an isolated area. To keep your food and water safe:


Pack foods in tight, waterproof bags or containers. Keep them in an insulated cooler if needed.
Wash hands and surfaces often. Use hand sanitizer if water is not available.
Separate raw foods from cooked foods.
Cook foods to proper (correct) temperatures.
Chill foods when needed as to keep them from spoiling.

, Chances are, if you're traveling close to home, you'll already have any needed inoculations. However, if you're planning a trip abroad, getting vaccinated can help protect against diseases you're not typically exposed to. You can be exposed to many different illnesses outside, and camping may make you more vulnerable to them. Check with your doctor or nurse to see if you've had all of the recommended vaccines, and if it is appropriate to get vaccinated right now. He/she may recommend shots for tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), meningitis, and/or hepatitis A, depending on your medical history, destination, and other factors.

, Some wild animals carry diseases that are dangerous to people. Avoid touching, feeding, and getting near wild animals. Watch from a distance. Keep foods stored in sealed containers and out of the reach of animals.


Wild animals may look cute and harmless, but they are very unpredictable and can be very territorial and protective. Always be alert and aware of your surroundings. In most cases, animals are more afraid of you than you are of them, and will run away.
Do not attempt to feed wild animals. Most injuries occur when people try to feed them. Keep your food safely stored away, out of the reach of animals. Do not keep food in your tent- this will attract wild animals. Keep your campsite clean, and do not leave food, garbage, coolers, cooking equipment or utensils out in the open. This will keep bears away.
Use a flashlight a night. Many animals feed at night, and the light from the flashlight will ward them away and scare them off.

, Familiarize yourself with any dangerous plants that are common to your camping area. If you come into contact with a poisonous plant, immediately rinse the affected area with water and apply a soothing lotion to the affected area. Some plants to look out for are poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac.The old saying ""Leaves of three, let it be!"" is a simple and quick reminder for identifying poison ivy and oak, but not poison sumac. Poison sumac usually has clusters of 7-13 leaves. Even poison ivy and poison oak may have more than three leaves, and their look may vary depending on the environment or exact species encountered. To avoid being in contact with these plants:


Poison ivy can be identified by looking for these features: eastern poison ivy is typically a hairy, rope-like vine with three shiny green (or red in the fall) leaves budding from one small stem. Western poison ivy is typically a low shrub with three leaves that does not form a climbing vine. Poison ivy may have yellow or green flowers and white to green-yellow or amber berries. Poison oak is typically a shrub with three leaves, like poison ivy. Pacific poison oak may be vine-like. Poison oak may have yellow or green flowers and clusters of green-yellow or white berries.
Poison sumac is a woody shrub that has stems containing 7-13 leaves arranged in pairs. It may have glossy, pale yellow, or cream-colored berries.
Visit the CDC website for more information on identification of these plants, symptoms, and treatment.

, Build them in a safe area. Open fires should be far enough away from the tent to prevent ignition from sparks, flames, and heat. Never use flame or any other heating device inside a tent. Use a flashlight or any other battery powered light device instead. Always attend your fires. Be sure you have an area for a fire that cannot spread horizontally or vertically- a grill or stone surface is ideal for this. When putting the fire out, drown it with water, making sure all embers, coals and sticks are wet. Embers buried deep within the pile of kindling have a tendency to reignite later, so be sure to check that all embers are extinguished.
Practice good fire safety. Clear the fire area of all debris, and avoid areas with overhanging branches that could possibly ignite. When constructing a fire ring, surround it with rocks to avoid the flames spreading. , Carbon monoxide is an odorless and colorless gas that can cause illness or death in people and pets. Never use fuel-burning equipment such as gas stoves, heaters, lanterns, and charcoal grills inside a tent or other enclosed shelter. It can cause dangerous levels of carbon monoxide to build up because the space is so small and does not let the gas escape. As an alternative to using fuel-burning appliances inside an enclosed shelter, bring adequate bedding and clothing. Consume extra calories and fluids to prevent hypothermia.
Carbon monoxide poisoning produces flu-like symptoms, watery eyes, headaches, dizziness, fatigue and possibly death. If someone you know has contacted carbon monoxide poisoning: 1) Get the victim to fresh air. 2) If the victim isn’t breathing, give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. 3) Get medical help. Call the nearest emergency medical service, law enforcement official or ranger. 4) Transport the victim to a medical facility with a hyperbaric chamber. , Talk to your veterinarian and make sure your dog is healthy and up to date on all required vaccinations, especially rabies. Ask your veterinarian if it is appropriate for your dog to be vaccinated against Lyme disease, a disease carried by ticks. Discuss appropriate flea and tick control. Be sure your dog is protected against heartworms, a parasite transmitted by mosquito bites. Cases of heartworm have been reported in all 50 states, according to the American Heartworm Society.


Have your pet wear a collar with tags that include your name, address, and phone number, in case he/she gets lost. Use a cell phone number where you can be reached at all times, not a home phone number, on the tag or collar. Microchipping your dog will provide extra protection in the event your dog gets lost. Register the microchip. If your dog has already been microchipped, make sure the information is up to date, so that you can be contacted when your dog is located.
Always have plenty of cool water for drinking to prevent dehydration. Bring your own water for your dog if water is not available at the campsite. Do not allow your dog to drink out of bodies of water such as lakes, ponds or streams. These could have bacteria that could potentially make your dog sick.
Your dog should continue to eat his regular diet during the trip. Pack enough food and treats to last the whole trip. Pack a food dish and water bowl as well. Bring bedding and toys to keep your dog occupied, and make sure he/she gets proper exercise. Pack a leash as well.
Take a copy of your dog’s health records and vaccination reports, especially if you are crossing state borders. Other essential items to bring on your trip include: a carrier or other means to confine your dog when necessary, bags to pick up your dog’s waste, a first aid kit and any medications your dog takes regularly. , Dampness and cold may seem difficult to handle, but a little forethought and common sense will keep any sleeping bag dry and warm. Buy a good quality sleeping bag with a water-repellent, windproof shell. You can also cocoon yourself by slipping the bag into a bivouac (bivy sack), which is waterproof. Remember to choose a dark colored sleeping bag. It will absorb the sun’s warmth when you dry it outside the next morning. Change into dry clothes- preferably polypropylene underwear- before going to bed. Don't breathe into the bag- this causes moisture problems.
If you plan to spend several consecutive nights in subzero weather, add a vapor barrier liner of nylon cloth. You can purchase these by the yard at camping supply or fabric stores. Bags that don’t get a chance to dry out in extremely cold weather collect body moisture in their insulation. This moisture freezes and can literally add pounds of ice to an untreated bag. As an alternative to purchasing a vapor barrier liner, you can make your own by wearing a plastic garbage bag over your long underwear, or wearing your raincoat to bed. To protect hands and feet during extreme cold, wear empty sandwich bags or bread sacks over them.
If you don't own a high quality sleeping bag, you can: 1) Wear a ski cap to bed. If your feet are still cold with the ski cap, wear a warm hat instead. About half of your body heat is lost through your head. 2) Eat a good meal. Be sure to eat meals rich in protein, carbohydrates and fat. 3) Drink lots of liquids (except alcohol, since it lowers body temperature) before going to bed. 4) Lay a closed-cell foam pad next to the ground. Put another pad of softer foam on top of the first pad.

, If you hear thunder, it means you are within ten miles of a thunderstorm, and as such should immediately seek shelter. Though a tent may seem like a suiting shelter, avoid it at all costs. The aluminum poles that hold up the tent can be very dangerous as they are good conductors of electricity. Get into a vehicle if possible. The rubber in the tires are insulators, meaning they block the flow of electricity and absorb it, deadening the contact if your vehicle were to be struck by lightning. If you're swimming and hear thunder, get out of the water immediately. Water is a extremely good conductor of electricity. If you are going hiking while on your camping trip, avoid the summits of mountains, crests of ridges, slopes above timberline, and large meadows as they are hazards during thunderstorms. If you happen to be in an exposed area when a storm is approaching, quickly descend to a lower elevation, away from the direction of storm. Squat or kneel down on a pad while keeping your head low. An exceptional area for protection is a dense forest located in a depression. Trees can be dangerous in such a situation, however; so avoid taking shelter under isolated trees or trees much taller than neighboring ones. By doing this, you have minimal contact with the ground, which in turn reduces any danger from ground currents. "

Look for a location.",How to Start a Youth Group1," You could also run your own ideas by them to see if they would be interested in joining a group that you developed. Think about the kinds of activities you enjoy, and try to form a group from that. Some themes might be:


Outdoor -- hiking, camping
Sports
Church
Crafts
Drama
Movies
Robotics
Legos;
, Do you want to start a scouting troop (either boys or girls)? Do you want to go to Lego competitions? If you are thinking about being part of a larger organization, or attending events put on by a larger organization, look for information from them about what you’ll need to do to make your group eligible. Any large organization for kids is going to have a website like the ones cited below., For most groups, particularly those that are part of larger organizations, you need an adult to help. Some youth groups are primarily kid-run, while others have an adult in charge. Decide what kind of model you want for your group., Will your group be associated with your school, or is it neighborhood-based? Regardless of how you are going to get members, you need to find a place where your group can meet for free. Talk to someone at your school, library, or community center to see if there would be room for your group.

Tell your friends about the club.,
Advertise for more members.,
Announce your club at school or church.",How to Start a Youth Group2," Hopefully you will get your first members from the friends you ask. But some friends probably don’t want to join. For those that don’t, try not to take it personally. It’s most likely that they just have different interests than you do. Most kids also have a lot of homework and extracurriculars, and it’s often hard to add anything else.

, If you don’t think your group has enough people in it already, make some posters. Explain what your group will be doing, when and where it will be meeting, and how to contact you for more information., If you’re still needing members, ask if you can have a moment in class or in church to talk to people about your group. It’s a great way to get to a lot of people at the same time, and then they can easily come up to you afterward and let you know they are interested.

Run your first meeting.",How to Start a Youth Group3," Think about what you want and would be best for the group. If you are going to be working with people outside the group, make sure that you have reached out to them and they know what you are planning. You will need to know the answer to the following questions before you begin:Who will be in charge of what, and how will that be determined?
Will your adult advisor be integral to the group, or just someone who is there sometimes to observe?
Will the club be primarily social, or will there be a stronger activity or service component?
Will the club fundraise or ask for dues for activities and events?

, Write an agenda for the topics you will cover at the meeting. Bring snacks or drinks. Try to make it a fun, informal, and hopefully short meeting. Some of the things you could cover at the meeting include:The group’s constitution -- bylaws, rules and regulations, etc.
Election of officers
Brainstorming fundraising ideas
Planning the first activity or event
Icebreaker games to get to know all of the members
How often you will meet and if anyone will be bringing snacks

, It could be a special Facebook page or an email or text list. Make it easy to add and delete members, and for members to communicate with each other. For your first communication, let them know the specifics of the first meeting.

, Stay on task, cover what you need to, and keep it fun and short. People are joining your club for the activities and the other members, not the meetings. Try some games to help people get to know each other at the first meeting. Some good ones can be found at the website below."
"
Plan good events.,
Delegate.,
Keep it fun.",How to Start a Youth Group4," People will keep coming if you have good events. Talk to your members about what kinds of activities they want to do, and plan for them. Vary your events -- some small and some big -- it’s easy to get burned out when you’re going from one big organizational challenge to the next. Make time for the group to get together and have some less-structured fun. Smaller events could be based more on bonding as a group rather than your larger mission, and could include:Making and eating a meal together
A trip to the movies
Rollerskating or ice skating
A trip to the zoo

, Even though you might be the one to have started the group and continue to lead it, you can’t do it all. Know when you need help, and ask for it. Be comfortable telling members the kinds of help that the club needs to do a task and having them sign up to assist. And when it stops being fun for you, think about letting someone else be in charge. If you’re not sure the best way to delegate, check the website below for tips., Your group should be about the shared activities and events, not meetings and bureaucratic procedures. Make sure the group stays focused on the reasons they became a group and keep the organizational stuff to a minimum. Try to conduct as much of the bureaucratic necessities over email or Facebook beforehand, so the meetings can be reserved for discussions or activities."

They might be as simple as announcing the presence of the camping trip: “Janice and John’s Camping Site.” For inside the room, your signs can set the mood, such as “Watch out for bears.”


Use poster board if you want the signs to last, but construction paper is a less expensive and more colorful option.;
, If you have or buy some washable markers that are meant for glass, you can decorate your windows as if you were at a campground. You can draw trees, birds, and even raccoons.


Use stencils to help the images look more realistic.

, Drape blankets and sheets over dressers, chairs, and electronics. Try to find ones that are brown or green so that they can look like trees, bushes, or even outhouses. Use floral sheets to look like you have flower bushes.

, Explore the room in a new way. Use glow sticks to look around. They’re safer than real candles, and you can find them in the shape of wands, swords, and even butterflies at many stores.

, Some stores sell fake fires with fluttering strips of fabric. You don’t have to spend money, though. You can simply take a large flashlight with a flat bottom, point it at the ceiling, and gather some brown paper around the base of it. Include some orange, red, and yellow paper to help emulate flames.

, Get a colander from the kitchen and a small flashlight. Shine the light through the holes in the colander to get a view of the “stars.”

, Find any stuffed toys you have to distribute around the campsite. You can use wild animals or birds, or add in a few less-commonly seen woodland animals, like horses or dogs.

, Cut out bugs from paper or find or buy plastic bugs. Spiders, mosquitoes, and ants can all be found at a campground. Leave them outside the sleeping quarters. Sneak some inside the tent or even inside sleeping bags to give a true camping experience to your fellow campers.

, There are channels on digital radio stations, such as Pandora or Spotify, that play sounds of nature. If you prefer a visual experience, Netflix and other streaming services offer the “Yule Log” experience so you can watch a fire.


Many of the Yule Log programs play Christmas music. Turn down the sound to help stay in the camping mood.

, If you already have a pup tent or a small tee-pee, push your bed out of the way and set up in the middle of the room. It should be the centerpiece of your campsite.Measure the room and the tent before you get started. You don’t want to find out it isn’t going to fit after you begin.

, You’ll need four or five chairs with high backs and at least two large light-weight blankets or sheets. Queen or king size bedding is best.


Put the chairs in a circle with extra space between two of them for your entrance.
Drape the blankets or sheets so that they cover the chair backs and hang down over the sides, creating the walls around your fort.
To help keep the walls from falling down during the night, you can use safety pins at the top to attach them to the chairs., The floor, even if it’s carpeted, can be uncomfortable when you’re sitting or sleeping on it all night long. Spread out thick blankets or comfy sleeping bags to avoid sore sports.

, Put all your electronic devices, such as phones, iPods, and tablets, outside the room when you start your camping trip. It will let you get in touch with the wilderness of your room., Camping involves sitting around, so find your favorites. You may want to play a card game like “Uno,” a board game like “Life,” or even dominos. Unlike a real campsite, you know that you’ll have a level playing surface on the floor.

, You can write your own or read them from a book or website. Use your lighting to help make it spooky.You can download and play ghost stories, but you’ll have to break the no technology rule.

, Choose a digital camera, a disposable camera, or a Polaroid camera. You can pose with each other, with the “wild animals” that you find, or with one of the signs. When you’re done, make a scrapbook to remember your trip.

, If anyone in the group plays a campground-appropriate instrument like a guitar, have them bring it along. Campfire sing-alongs are always a great way to have a good time.

,, Use your favorite ingredients. Some common ingredients are M&Ms, Chex cereal, Cheerios, raisins, peanuts, almonds, cashews, Reese’s pieces, mini pretzels, sunflower or pumpkin seeds, shredded coconuts, and dried fruits. You can make it as healthy or as decadent as you want., Hot dogs are a traditional campfire food. Use a grill-pan on the stove to get the same lines that you would get on BBQ grill. Don’t forget the buns and condiments.

, Do it the old fashioned way. Air-pop popcorn makers are still easy to find at most big box stores or you can pop it on the stove. Microwave popcorn is a good enough substitution.

, Make a sandwich with a piece of graham cracker, a square of chocolate, a large marshmallow, and another piece of graham cracker on top. Put your sandwich on a microwave safe plate, and microwave for between 15 and 30 seconds. Let it cool before eating.


If you prefer not to cook at all, you can replace the marshmallow layer with marshmallow fluff and have an even easier (although cold) s’mores with almost no effort.

, Pick up all your food after each meal. Put it away in proper containers and leave these either in the car or in strong, hard-to-undo camping cabinets or storage which are odor-covering. Clear away any food scraps and dispose of them properly in the garbage.


Don't leave food unattended when cooking. Always have someone watching it.






Don't leave food inside the tent or under tarpaulins. The dingo's keen sense of smell will lead it to rip the tent or upend the tarp to get at the goodies. Some campsites have food storage lockers; make use of them if you don't have a car or rig.






Pour used washing up water down a drain or far away from your campsite. And keep tea towels, tablecloths, serviettes, etc., all out of reach of the dingoes too.







, As they pass on their way, pass on yours too. Do not harass them by poking sticks, throwing objects or stones at them, or acting like a yahoo. Leave them be and get on with human activities.

, Dingoes steal shoes and are curious about anything they can pick up in their mouths and run off with.


Don't leave anything around that could flap or wave in the wind, or glint in the light and attract the interest of a dingo.






Put away all personal hygiene products in odor-proof containers. Items such as toothpaste, shampoo, deodorant, etc., can smell like food to the dingo.







, As well, put all rubbish, including soiled nappies, tampons, and food scraps inside secure rubbish bins or inside the car until disposed of properly. This includes all beverage containers such as beer cans, fruit juice boxes, milk cartons, etc.


Do not hang rubbish from trees. Dingoes will jump.







, If dingoes do come close, be calm and stay together, not letting any of your family and friends out of your sight. Sing songs and make calm but firm noises to shoo them away.

Don't bring your cell phone.,
When camping, always make sure your tent is set up properly.,
Bring comfortable, sporty clothes.,
Have fun!,
Bring a small day pack to carry water, a raincoat, and snacks.,
Pack light- you don't want to be lugging a suitcase up a hill to the campsite, do you?

,
If you're planning to pull pranks, bury the materials in a hidden pocket, or in a toiletries bag.",How to Have Fun at a School Camp," If you have to, don't turn it on. You're there to bond, and chances are you picked a partner, and she/he is your best bud! This could be a great lesson on how to have fun without electronics;
, Many people set it up wrong, it rains, and they get wet! Sometimes, in a rainy area, leeches can get in! Make sure to zip it up fully!

, Don't bring your stiletto's, tube top and mini skirt. You'll be doing activities which mean these are completely unneeded. Bring your shorts, a nice short sleeve tee, and a pair of your old, broken-in sneakers.

, Some of the activities are a once in a lifetime, so face your fears. You'll regret it otherwise.

, When you're hiking or walking around, it's helpful and easier to carry.

Leave the giant trail backpack at home and pack a traditional carry on luggage suitcase or other tall storage device (like a cheap plastic chest of drawers).,
Underneath everything in the back slip the lid of the largest sterilite storage tub you can get your hands on to catch spills when you're hauling the deer home (the tub of which you can use to store hunting gear in the garage at home).,
If there's not a decent water source at your destination, or you're disinclined to use precious time purifying it, stock up on used 1-2 L gatorade, soda or large fruit juice plastic bottles.,
Buy a bicyclist's double toddler cart that connects to your mountain bike from Craigslist (used ones are under $35, though new they're $200).,
Pack your unscented hunting clothes and field-only boots/shoes in an airtight soft case.,
Keep your scent sprays and wafers inside the bag (I boil down a gallon of leaves/needles/detritus from within 1000 yards of the space I'll be hunting, strain with a coffee filter, sterilize with rubbing alcohol and use it for a scent spray).,Pack your sleeping bag/light sheet, Thermarest mattress/camp chair, comfy pillow, and your choice of contemplative or devotional reading materials under the cart in the trunk.,
You should be able to carefully set your deer stand in the front seat (use your towel if you foresee serious scratches occurring).,Pack your daypack and tuck it in the nested climbing tree stand in the front seat (a typical student backpack that you hoist on a paracord into your stand) with your deer field dress kit, airtight snack/lunch bag, a gym sock with 1 cup baking soda inside then knotted shut and stored in a zip lock bag (you tap it to see which way gentle wind's blowing and dab your sweat with it to crystallize it and prevent it from drifting as badly), first aid kit with water purification tablets, bandanna, climbing safety harness, headlamp, freezer bag with folding trowel & travel TP roll inside, deer call/antlers, reflective tacks, yardage flag tags for your shooting lanes in bow season, mosquito mesh hooded jacket, CO2 bike pump/tire patch kit for quick flat repairs, bear spray in bear country, handgun in coyote country if permissible, a $2 AA powered USB cell charger to recharge your cell/gps battery on cold days, and a cheap fast-starting superzoom point/shoot camera (more useful IMO than binoculars with these 15-30x optical zooms nowadays).,
Pack your bow or rifle.,
Now set your chest of drawers in the hatchback last of all on the right side and put your cook kit and backpack stove with fuel can in the gallon milk jug well on the Prius' left side.,
Mount your mountain bike on the bike rack on the back of Prius and hit the road (or if your hunting spot is within a mile or so of the campsite, just use the gear cart in 'push' mode and hike it in and out).,
Once you arrive at your destination, slide your driver seat all the way forward and move your chest of drawers to the footwell behind it.,Line your gear up on the opposite side of the back of the Prius and leave yourself a nice kitchen space at the tail on your Sterilite lid.,
At night, enjoy a small campfire and read in your camp chair, then unfold it to make your bedroll and hit the hay.,
There you go!,
Now here is the magic part of using a Prius: If the night is excruciatingly hot or well below freezing, you can actually leave the Prius running with the A/C or heat at a reasonable temperature and it will only burn about 1 gal a night.,
For airflow issues on a hot summer's night, you can pack a small tent to camp next to your car or you can just crack the windows and put mosquito mesh over them (search online for tips on this technique).,
Once you get a deer:

Use the steel triangle on a rope to hoist the deer when you get back to the car, then go ahead and skin and quarter it at the nearest tree.,
Finish processing your deer, as soon as you get home, on a sterile backyard table with your sawz-all and proper cutting implements; then pack each cut in freezer bags and label with a sharpie before storing in the deep freeze (don't pack several steaks together as you'll never get them apart again!).,Relish in the knowledge that you have offset many dollars spent on your hunting gear in fuel savings, also a savings which you can re-invest in your local community rather than sending it to pad the pillows of someone's custom yacht.",How to Hunt or Camp in a Toyota Prius," Use this to pack food supplies (I use: 5 min rice, potato flakes, canned refried beans, canned chicken, steri-packed $2 Indian food pouches, PB&J, jerky, trail mix/granola w/dried fruit, fast oatmeal, any of the cream/sugar inclusive cheap instant coffees pouches exported from Vietnam, raisins, lots of apples & bananas, tea bags, and raisins.)
, On the side, slip a bone saw and hanging triangle with rope (if you own a battery powered sawz-all this can save some time when splitting the spine and quartering)., They hold a lot and still fit in the bottle sleeve on the gear you already carry when out hunting, plus you can tuck them all over the car wherever they'll fit to use up unused crannies and under-seat storage. Platypus & Nalgene roll-up 2L bottles with a drinking hose also work well. Always pack more water than you think you'll use, as you will want to rinse gear that gets bloody when you get a deer and rinse blood from the body cavity when dressing (do towel up the extra moisture inside before hauling or you'll be risking bacterial growth)., This will be both your deer cart and the way you haul your field gear and bow or rifle into the back-country when access roads beyond the campsites are still bike or hike only (especially in bow season). Ask your ranger; they'll help you be sure to follow the rules that aren't posted and are in your favor on a bike. These carts have great vertical and lateral suspension and are over-engineered to protect children. As a result, they'll haul a good sized field-dressed deer, your $30 climbing tree stand from craigslist, airtight hunting clothes bag, daypack with supplies, and a bow or rifle without even flinching., The bag that a bedding set came in: sturdy zipper, thick clear plastic, and gotten freely from many friends/family is a great tool for this job. Pack this bag in the shoe well of the bike cart, then place the cart in the back of the Prius with seats folded down., When you make your own scent spray you can afford to really liberally apply it to everything you have on you. You'll need about 1 liter per trip. Store it in a jug in the fridge.,, This will take a little finagling to get a right fit, so be patient while you learn how to do it.,, (bow should fit on top of the deer cart or rifle beside it) Take care to separate ammunition per your state's laws., If you have any extraneous gear to squeeze in, you can put it in the expansive storage space under the trunk. It's a great place to put a roadside emergency kit, jumper cables, 1 gal fuel jug, tow rope, DC air compressor, etc., You can climb a pretty nasty mountain trail with these little $30 kiddie carts, so prepare to be pleased!, It should now create a full 7' bed for one onto which you can unroll your bedding. Chain your deer/gear cart and bike together next to your car, and if you really have concerns about theft, secure it to one of the tow loops under the Prius. Since you're on public land, you may need to chain your bike/cart to a tree once near your hunting spot and walking your stand into position.) You'll be leaving your biking clothes and shoes in the cart, but folks don't tend to steal that!,, If your shoulder blades are having trouble with the joint between the car seat and top of the chest of drawers, lay that Sterilite lid underneath the Thermarest for better support., Now in the morning you can gear up, heat a pot of water which will warm your hands too and pour some in your oatmeal bowl and some in your coffee cup, and leave a little to rinse stuff when you're done and brush your teeth (You can brush with baking soda for bow hunting mornings). Since your food is in a sealed car, you don't have to worry about bear bags or trash bag issues., The car should remain off until the electric battery runs down and then the internal combustion engine will come on for about 1 minute every 45 minutes to recharge itself. Even if gas is $4/gallon, you've saved so much by getting 50mpg on your drive out that you've got nothing to complain about! If you haven't done the 'charge while off' hack to your Prius, the added bonus of leaving it running is that you can charge your phone/gps that night too., A lot of mosquito mesh can be had on eBay for $5 with free shipping.,
Skin with a fresh box knife razor or a scalpel, just can't top that for precise work (plan to use up 2 blades). You can usually fit the whole quartered up deer in a double bagged 60 gallon trash bag set on the lid of the large sterilite tub (to catch leaks). Hit your nearest gas station on the way home to set some ice bags on top if needed (don't put it in the meat and make it wet though!).

, If you can't afford a full strength grinder that can handle deer meat, take any grind cuts to your local deer processor to make ground and sausage, however is your custom.,"

Position the camper where you would like it to be on your campsite.,
Check side to side level of the camper.,
Move the camper either straight forward or back approximately 1.5 feet.,
Place a piece of plywood, approximately 1.5 feet long and wider than the width of the camper wheel, in the spot where the wheel was before you moved the camper.,Move the camper so the wheel is centered on top of the plywood you just placed down.,
Recheck side to side level.,
Place small blocks of wood in front and behind both wheels once your camper is level side to side.,
Pull the retaining pin and swing down the camper tongue jack.,Unplug the electrical connection from the tow vehicle to the camper.,Unhook the safety chains.,Raise the camper tongue off of the tow vehicle hitch, by cranking down on the tongue jack until the tongue is fully separated from the tow hitch ball.,Move the tow vehicle away from the camper.,Check level front to back.,
Crank the handle on the tongue jack clockwise to raise the tongue end of the camper and counter clockwise to lower as necessary to achieve level.

,
Pull out your campers electrical cord and run it to the electrical hookup on the campsite.

,
Turn off the breaker at the campsite electrical hookup.,Plug your campers plug into the hookup and switch the breaker back on.,
Switch the power on (the green 120 V switch) to your camper fridge at the back panel.,Set out your outdoor rug or mat on the door side of the camper if you are going to use one.,
Insert the end of the crank handle into the screw rod end of the camper support.

,
Crank down the four camper supports near to the ground without them completely touching yet.,
Unlatch the four roof latches by pulling down the latch and pulling away the clip.

,
Crank up the camper roof.,
Crank down the four camper supports the rest of the way to the ground.,
Remove any items you need from the trunk of your camper if it has one.,
Grasp the handles on the outside end of one of the beds and pull it fully out until you feel a solid stop.,
Pull out the free end of the bed support pole which is underneath the bed.,
Lift up on the bed to fully latch both supports.,Pull out the second bed using the same steps as the first.,
Pull out and twist the two latches to release the slideout (if your camper has one).

,Grasp both handles on the slide out lift slightly and pull out until you feel a solid stop.,Attach the velcro on the canvas to the slide out to secure it.,
Hook the bungee cords on the bed canvas to the hooks underneath the beds to secure the canvas.

,
Insert the end of the interior canvas support pole onto the canvas support frame at the end of the bed and lift.


,
Push out on the pole while positioning the other end into the support clip.,
Unsnap the door from the ceiling of the camper and carefully lower it into the door opening.


,
Turn the locking clips on top left and right sides of the door so they engage the slots to hold the door securely.

,Attach the velcro on the canvas to the outside of the door frame.,
Grab the handle on the galley, lift and slowly lower it into position.


,
Take the outdoor stove (if you are using one) to the hookup spot on the side of the camper.,
Angle the front of the stove down while lifting the back and set it on the support while slowly lowering it down.,Connect the male end of the propane hose on the outdoor stove to the female propane fitting on the lower frame of the camper.,
Open the valve on top of the propane tank.,
Connect a sanitary water hose from your camper to the water spigot (if there is one on your campsite) and open the valve.,
Connect a drain hose onto the drain fitting on the outside of the camper.,Connect the end of the hose to a grey water tank or bucket.,

Push down and turn the gas knob to pilot and hold down.


,
Place a flame on the end of the pilot tube that is pointing to the inside, using a long lighter and wait till the pilot stays lit.,
Turn the knob to on.",How to Set Up a Pop Up Camper," Do not unhook your tow vehicle yet. When selecting the location, consider things like:

Slope of the ground (you can only adjust level so much)
Location of trees (don't want to hit roof when raised or beds when pulled out)
Proximity to the fire pit (give yourself enough room)
Location of electrical hookup if using one (make sure your cord is long enough);
,


If it is already level you can skip to blocking the wheels.
Note which side is low. This will be the wheel you will need to level up.

, This can be difficult to gage at first so it may be helpful to have a spotter watching on the outside until you get the hang of it.,


Stack more than one piece of wood if the site is particularly unlevel.
There are commercial leveling blocks available but plywood works just fine and is probably cheaper.

,, If it is still unlevel repeat the step where you move the camper and then add more plywood. It is good to have a supply of at least three to five pieces of plywood to stack if the spot is particularly unlevel.

, These can be just cut up pieces of two by four. The purpose is to keep the camper from moving when you unhook your tow vehicle as well as while you are camping. Once again, there are commercial blocks available but wood blocks work just fine.

,



The tongue jack is at the front end of the camper next to the propane tanks and battery.
The retaining pin is located at the midway point on the tongue jack.
Make sure the tongue jack is retracted enough to enable it to swing to the full down position.
Place a piece of wood underneath the jack wheel if you are camping on sandy or other soft ground to keep it from just sinking into the sand.

,,,,,,,,

The campsite electrical hookup is usually a three foot tall post typically near the back of the campsite.
It is safer to plug your campers electrical cord in with the breaker at the hookup off.

,, This is especially important if you have food already in the fridge.


Most camper refrigerators will operate on 12V DC battery power (which does not work very well), as well as propane.

,,,


This is to provide security for the camper (it will not tip) while still allowing the frame to flex while raising the roof.

,,


This is done using the same handle that you used to lower the supports. It inserts into the roof crank spot at the back of the camper.
Crank clockwise to raise the roof until it will not turn anymore and the roof is at it's full height.

, You will feel some increased resistance when they contact the ground. Give them just a little snug after that. There is no need to crank too tight.

These are located at the four corners of the camper near the bottom.

, You will be pulling out the beds soon, and it will be more difficult to remove things after that., As you pull it firmly out stay aware of the position of the canvas to make sure it is not catching on anything. If something doesn't feel right STOP.


Check the canvas, pull it away from anything it could catch.
Check the inside of the camper to be sure the bed isn't catching on something.
It is necessary to pull firmly, but if it's not moving, something is wrong. Don't force it.

,


Position the free end of the support pole onto the stud on the frame of the camper.
Repeat this with the second support pole.

, You will feel the bed come up as you lift and then it will sit down solidly when you set it down.,,,,,,,


Repeat this process with the other bed.

,,,,,

This spot is on the door side of the camper. The stove sits about waist level.

, The lower bracket will rest on the side of the camper and will feel secure.,, Give the propane lines a few minutes to equalize pressure in the system before turning on or using anything requiring propane.


The propane tanks are located at the front end of the camper.

,



The hose hookup spot on the camper is on the side opposite the door side and near the back end.
Switch on power to your camper's water pump if you don't have a water spigot and are going to be using your water tank instead.
This switch is located inside the camper next to the galley.

,

The drain fitting is on the back side of the camper. Your sink drains out of this fitting.

,,


The access panel is located near the front of the camper on the side opposite the camper door.

,, Be sure to continue holding down the knob while doing this.

, The hot water tank should go into full fire mode and begin heating the water.

If the pilot goes out, turn the gas knob to off and wait five minutes before repeating procedure.
NEVER light a lighter or bring in an open flame if you smell propane.

Organize and store a first-aid kit.,
Stock up on water.,
Store enough non-perishable food.,
Stock up on flashlights and extra batteries.,
Keep a wrench or pliers readily available to turn off utilities.,
Store your emergency items together.",How to Make a Survival Kit1," A first-aid kit will prevent small injuries from becoming infected and leading to major medical complications. Things that should go into your first-aid kit include iodine, gauze pads, medical tape, alcohol wipes, antibiotic ointment, aspirin, scissors, and a scalpel.Optional items in your first-aid kit should include things like vitamins, sunblock, and bug repellent.
Remember to pack all prescription medicine, including inhalers.;
, Consider the number of people that you have in your household and determine how much water you'd need for two weeks. You should be able to pack at least one gallon per person, so if you were alone, that would be 14 gallons of water total. If you have more people in your family, you'll need to pack more water to keep everyone hydrated., Bring at least three days of non-perishable food. This includes things like canned foods, salt-free crackers, and whole grain cereals. Foods to bring in a survival situation include rice, beans, peanut butter, canned meat, and lard.Choose things that don't require refrigeration and that don't have long preparation times.If you are stranded in the wilderness, you may be able to scavenge food from local plants, bugs, animals, or fish.
Purchase a manual can opener so that you can use it any situation.If you forget to bring a can opener, you can use a survival knife as an alternative.

, A flashlight can be used to illuminate areas when it gets dark and is a versatile survival tool. Flashlights are critical if your car breaks down on the side of the road or of you're stuck outside at night with no light. Purchase lithium batteries over alkaline because they provide more power and have a longer shelf-life.


You can also use a flashlight as a blunt self-defense weapon.
Popular survival flashlights include Elzetta Bravo, Olight M23 Javelot, and Eagletac GX30A3D., During a natural disaster, you may have to turn off your utilities like water, natural gas, and electricity. Cracked lines in water pipes could pollute your water, while natural gas leaks could lead to an explosion. Keep pliers or a wrench packed in your emergency supply kit in case this happens., Let everyone in the household know where the emergency kit is. In the case of an emergency, you may be required to pick up and leave quickly so it's better if all of your emergency items are organized together. Good places to store your emergency kit include an attic, the basement, a closet, or shed.

Consider the climate and terrain.,
Purchase a survival knife.,
Bring sufficient water or purchase a water filter.,
Carry a fire starter.,
Carry a compass or GPS device.,
Pack the supplies for a shelter.",How to Make a Survival Kit2," Before you start to pack your survival kit, you'll have to determine the climate and conditions of the place that you'll be. For instance, a desert climate will require different equipment than if you were stuck in a forest or at sea. Cater your survival kit to the climate and environment.


Special equipment needed for desert survival kits include leaf bags to protect you from the suns rays, extra water, and balloons for carrying water and signaling for rescue.A survival kit for the sea includes items like life vests, fishing equipment, inflatable boats, and flares., A good knife can be used in a multitude of ways when you're in the wilderness. A knife can help you build shelter, start a fire, hunt, cut food, clear paths, and cut twigs and string. Find a knife with a good balance of durability and cutting power, with a Rockwell Hardness between 54 to 58. You'll want to find a knife that can both pierce and cut things.A fixed blade knife is typically more durable than a folding knife under pressure.

, If you are in an area that has fresh streams and lakes to drink from, then you can buy a portable water filter. There are portable survival straws that will filter viruses, microorganisms, bacteria, chlorine, and heavy metals like lead and mercury. If you are in a more arid environment or have limited access to fresh water sources, make sure to pack as much fresh water as possible.Popular water filter brands include NDur Survival Straw, Sawyer Mini Water Filtration System, and the LifeStraw Survival Water Filter., When you're stranded in the wilderness, there's a good chance that you'll have to make a fire at some point. Fires can help you cook food and stay warm when it gets cold. There are multiple ways to do this including matches, a lighter, or a flint and scraper and each of these fire starting methods have their advantages and disadvantages.Store multiple matches among your gear in case you lose one batch of matches.
Get refillable butane lighters.
A flint and scraper will make sparks for a fire when wet.
Popular fire starter brands include Exotac NanoStriker XL, Coleman Magnesium Fire Starter, and UCO Titan Stormproof Matches., A GPS device can help guide you if you get lost in the wilderness but usually requires battery power and a signal. GPS can also malfunction. For this reason, you should always have a backup.When you can't use GPS, you can utilize a map in conjunction with a compass to find safety.


Popular compasses include the Phosphorescent Lensatic Compass, the Suunto A-10 Field Compass, and the Cammenga 3H Tritium Military Compass., If you have to endure a night in the wilderness, it's important that you build a makeshift shelter to stay warm or cool and protected from the elements. Items like tarps, ponchos, plastic sheets, or trash bags can be pinned to trees and act as a shelter. You can also buy tarps specifically created for survival at many outdoor shops."

Pack a hand-crank radio.,
Bring cell phones and extra cell phone chargers.,
Bring a map.,
Store personal hygiene products.,
Bring extra sets of clothing.",How to Make a Survival Kit3," An AM/FM hand crank radio will allow you to tune into special emergency notifications via NOAA alerts. To make sure that your radio can tune into those frequencies, check for the ""Public Alert"" and ""NOAA NWR All Hazards"" label on the packaging of your radio. A hand-crank will ensure that even if you run out of batteries, you'll still be able to tune into critical alerts and announcements.NOAA AM alerts are available in all 50 states of the U.S. on frequencies 162.400, 162.425, 162.450, 162.475, 162.500, 162.525, and 162.550.Check online to see the emergency frequency if you live outside of the U.S.
Radios typically cost anywhere from $25 to $50 USD.

, Cell phones are great devices to use to communicate during an evacuation or emergency. Make sure to bring extra batteries or boosters for your cell phones to increase the longevity of their use. Minimize use of your cell phone when you don't have access to a power source, and use it only to communicate important information to family and friends.You can also purchase a solar-powered or hand crank charger that will help keel electronic devices charged during an emergency.

, During an emergency, your GPS or phone may not be available. For this reason, it's important to keep a road map so that you know how to get to your evacuation site. Purchase a traditional paper road map from a gas station or you can print one out online and keep it in emergency storage in case of an emergency., If you need to leave in a rush and your area is devastated by a natural disaster, it may be difficult to find common hygiene products like toothpaste, toothbrushes, soap, razors, and feminine hygiene products. Make sure to put extra supplies in a zip lock bag and store it in your emergency supplies., You may not have access to your wardrobe for a long time after the emergency, so it's important to remember to pack extra sets of clothes. If you live in a place that experiences cold temperatures, bring the appropriate attire, such as, jackets, pants, shirts, and sweaters."

, No matter how chilly it gets at night, you’ll still excrete some liquid from your skin into your dry sleeping clothes. Fabrics that hold in liquids rather than let them pass through will make you colder. Think of it this way — imagine hanging your washed laundry out to dry, and pick the clothes (and fabrics) that dry the fastest.

Wear wool and avoid cotton. Generally speaking, these are the best and worst materials for keeping you warm despite being wet., Wool is great for moisture-wicking, but that bulky, itchy sweater Grandma got you for Christmas may not make the best camping pajamas. Prioritize breathable comfort, and use layers that are easy to peel off if necessary — for instance, if you get too warm during the night, or need to get up to use the bathroom.You might layer up, for instance, a vest and underwear, baggy T-shirt and tracksuit bottoms, normal socks, night socks, and a large jumper. Or try the one piece ""onesie"" pajamas that are warm, versatile, and easy to pack. Just try to keep cotton layers from making direct contact with your skin.

, Some campers argue that sleeping “in the buff” with lots of layers surrounding you keeps you warmest. However, combining thin layers of breathable clothing with layers of blankets and covers is likely your best bet for staying toasty. It also makes it less chilly (and more discreet) if you need to get up during the night!


That said, it’s better to sleep naked with lots of blankets if all of your clothes are wet.

, Nearly all sleeping bags now have ratings listed on the tag, indicating either a seasonal rating (three season, excluding winter, for instance) or a nighttime temperature range in which they can keep you warm. Don’t take chances in cold weather; do your homework, talk to experts, and pick a bag that can handle the nighttime temperatures you’ll be facing.Before departing on your camping trip, make sure your sleeping bag is in good condition — check for tears or holes, broken zippers or cinches, etc.

, The colder it is, the more layers you’ll want to add. Place blankets, towels, rugs, mats, or even extra clothing on top of your bag. You can also buy zip-up fleece liners to place inside your bag, or even double-up with a thinner bag inside a thicker one."

Lay on your back with your knees bent.,
Push your mid-back into the floor.,
Change the positioning of your hands and repeat this exercise.,
Look in a mirror if lying down doesn't work.,
Go to the bathroom before you try to perform pelvic floor muscles.",How to Do Pelvic Floor Exercises1," Perhaps you've never exercised your pelvic floor before, in which case, you should begin by locating and isolating these muscles. Place your hands on your pubic bones in a ""v"" formation.Your thumbs and forefingers should touch, with the outline of your hands laying along your hip bones and pelvic mound.
This particular method for locating your pelvic floor can work for both men and women, but may be easier for women.;
, As you press your lower back into the floor, think about tightening your lower abdominal muscles. Hold this position for 3-10 seconds. Relax your muscles and repeat this exercise a few times.Your fingers should still be on your pubic bones, and they should drop a few centimeters as you press your back into the floor.
If possible, try to relax your glutes, upper abs, and legs.

, Now open your legs and place two fingers on the space between your urethra and your anus (your perineum). Press your lower back into floor once again, and try to feel a squeezing and tightening in this area.Your fingers should move upward toward your pelvic muscles as you tighten your abs.
If you still do not feel these movements, you can try stopping the flow of urine when you are urinating. Feel the work that goes into that action, lifting muscles near your bladder, and try to mimic this movement when you do the exercises above. This is only recommended to try once as you are learning about the muscles. Do not repeat this as an exercise, or it can actually cause urinary problems.

, If you are a guy, the lying on your back method for locating your pelvic floor muscles may not work. An alternative is for you to stand in front of a mirror naked. Look at your body as you attempt to flex your pelvic floor muscles. If you are contracting the muscles correctly, you should be able to see your penis and scrotum lift up. When you relax your pelvic floor, you should see these parts drift back down., It can be helpful to do these exercises with an empty bladder, particularly if you are prone to incontinence. Fortunately, if you keep doing these exercises, you may be able to reduce instances of incontinence in your life."
"
Insulate between your body and the cold ground.,
Cinch your sleeping bag around your neck.,
Select the right type and size of tent.,
Set up your tent in a somewhat warmer location.",How to Stay Warm when Sleeping in a Tent2," Even a high-quality sleeping bag placed directly on the cold earth will not prevent you from feeling the chill. You can buy insulated sleeping mats (which have an R-value like home insulation panels) to place beneath you, or use rugs, mats, blankets, etc.If you’re using an air mattress, insulate beneath it as well.
If you’re using a camping bed, place bags, clothing, supplies, etc. beneath it to limit the flow of chilly air underneath you.

, But keep your head outside the bag. You might think that breathing warm air into the bag would be a good idea, but you’ll end up adding cold-conducting moisture and reducing your fresh air intake. Use the flaps or cinches on your bag to make a secure (but comfortable) seal around your neck.

Wear a knit hat that covers your ears to keep your head warm., Make sure you use a sturdy, well-maintained tent that is secure in the ground and free of holes or tears. If the tent fails in the middle of a cold night, you could be in serious trouble. The tent should limit cold drafts, yet allow some small amount of ventilation to prevent moisture buildup and provide fresh air.Choose the smallest tent that will (relatively) comfortably fit the number of people sleeping inside. This will hold in your body warmth better., If you expose your tent to cold breezes by placing it, for instance, on an exposed hilltop, everything inside it (including you) will end up colder. At the same time, though, cold air descends to low ground, so avoid sheltered valleys as well.Consider placing your tent under the canopy of a sturdy tree. The tree will shield your tent from some of the wind, and will retain some radiant heat from the daylight hours well into the evening. Choose a spot where you won’t be shielded from the rising (and warming) sun in the morning, though.

Eat a hearty meal before bedtime.,
Enjoy a few sips of a hot beverage.,
Try not to urinate, but don’t hold it in.,
Add warm packs or bottles to your sleeping bag.,
Heat up some rocks.,
Use a portable tent heater.,
Hang a reflective blanket above your sleeping area.,
Share a sleeping bag.",How to Stay Warm when Sleeping in a Tent3," While we associate it with food, a calorie is a unit of heat-producing energy.So, if you eat a calorie-laden meal before going to sleep, you’ll help stoke your inner furnace. Instead of loading up on donuts or other empty carbs, though, choose a meal that’s high in protein. This will keep your metabolism running at a higher rate for longer, which also results in increased body heat., Drink a bit of something that’s hot, but not filled with caffeine, shortly before going to sleep. Doing so can provide a warm feeling in your chest and stomach, which in turn makes you feel warmer. In addition to decaf coffee or teas, good options include hot milk, apple cider, or even powdered lemonade in hot water.Too much caffeine will keep you awake, and it also acts as a diuretic, which means you’ll be more likely to have to get up and go to the bathroom.
Try to drink just enough of beverages of any type (including plain water) to keep you hydrated but not make you need to urinate during the night. Finding the right amount for your body will take some practice.

, Getting up to go to the bathroom during the night will expose you to the cold, reduce your body temperature, and require you to repeat the process of layering up just right. However, holding in a full bladder expends energy (and thus body heat), making you colder regardless.Guys may be able to keep a designated “yellow bottle” in their sleeping bag to urinate in. The warm bottled urine may even provide a bit of extra heat! Human anatomy dictates that ladies are probably better off just getting up to go pee, however.

, Heat up some drinking water and fill one or more plastic drinking bottles with it. Stash them inside your sleeping bag, near your feet. They’ll help keep you warm and provide you with something to drink in the morning.Warm packs that you “snap” to start a warming chemical reaction will also work, but without the refreshing morning beverage.
If you’re using both warm water bottles and a “yellow bottle” for nighttime urination, be sure not to confuse them in the morning!

, Stones warmed near a fire will retain heat for a surprisingly long time. Wrap up larger stones in a towel or extra clothing, and place them strategically around the tent interior. You can do the same with smaller stones and place them right inside your sleeping bag.Make sure the rocks aren’t too hot to handle!

, You can use fuel-fed heaters that are made specifically for tent use, or, if you have access to electricity, plug-in models. Make sure that you use a heater rated for in-tent use and follow the instructions to the letter, however. For greater safety, you may want to run the heater only at bedtime and wake-up.Improperly situated, operated, or ventilated tent heaters can easily cause deadly fires or carbon monoxide poisoning.

, In case of emergency, you should always pack one of those shiny silver blankets that reflect light and heat. While they might trap in too much moisture if used as an in-tent blanket, their reflective properties can be quite useful. Simply hang the blanket from the tent ceiling, over top of where you’re sleeping. The blanket will help reflect your escaping body heat back down toward you during the night., Depending on the camping company you keep, you might be eager or hesitant to hop into a shared sleeping bag with a companion. But, regardless of your preferences, it’s a simple fact that two bodies releasing heat inside a sleeping bag will keep it warmer for longer. So, even if it means you have to cozy up with Cousin Larry, it’s probably better than shivering all night long!"

Find a private place to perform your Kegels.,
Lay on your back or sit on a chair.,
Perform Kegel contractions.,
Perform rapid contractions.",How to Do Pelvic Floor Exercises2," When you first start out, concentration will help you do these exercises more effectively. But once you get used to them, you can do several sets in the office, in the car, or at home without others knowing you are performing them., Start out in a comfortable position that helps you maintain good posture, such as sitting upright in a chair or lying on your back. Give yourself a moment to get comfortable before you begin., Contract your pelvic muscles for 3 seconds, then release them for 3 seconds. Repeat this exercise 10 times. Do some Kegels every day, and increase the number of sets you do each day as you grow stronger.Do 1 set for the first few days, then do 2 or 3 sets for the next few days.
After several weeks of doing Kegels, start holding your contractions for 10 seconds each time. Rest for 10 seconds in between. Work up to 3 sets per day, or 3 sets in a row each day.

, Once you can successfully contract your pelvic floor, try doing some quick contractions. Instead of tightening and holding, contract the muscles and release them 10 times in a row. Rest after you have done 10 fast contractions.In the beginning, it will be hard to contract and relax on a rhythm. Pay attention to the contracting strongly and quickly. After a week or 2, it should become easier.
Work up to 3 sets of 10 contractions each day, then, begin doing 3 sets in a row.

"
"
Perform bridges.,
Do jumping jacks.,
Practice wall squats.,
Do some ""dead bug crunches."",
Continue these exercises daily for at least 12 weeks.",How to Do Pelvic Floor Exercises3," Kegels are not the only way to strengthen your pelvic floor. There are numerous exercises you can do, and a great one is bridges. Start by laying on your back with your knees bent, keeping your feet about a fist distance apart. Then flex your lower abdominal muscles and lift your hips off the ground. Stop when there is a straight line from your knees to your shoulders. Hold for 3 seconds and slowly return your hips to the ground.Repeat 3 times. Work toward doing 3 sets of 10. Once you can do 3 sets, start increasing repetitions to 10 per set.
Try not to turn your head while your hips are lifted, as this can strain your neck.

, Jumping jacks are another great way to strengthen your pelvic floor. Start out with your legs together and your arms down. Then tighten your pelvic floor as you jump, moving your legs apart and bringing your arms up above your head. Relax your pelvic floor as you jump your legs back together and bring your arms down.Repeat for 30 to 60 seconds.

, Position yourself against a wall, with your feet about hip-width apart. Take a deep breath and tighten your pelvic floor. Then slide your back down the wall, lowering into a squat (like you're sitting in a chair). Hold this for 10 seconds, then stand back up.Do 10 reps.

, Start lying on your back, with your knees bent and your feet at knee level. Strength your arms straight up toward the ceiling. Take a deep breath, tighten your pelvic floor muscles, and extend your left arm and left leg in opposite directions. Release back to the position your started in, and repeat on the right side.Do 10 reps on each side.

, Make it a habit to exercise your pelvic floor. It can take up to 12 weeks of regular practice in order for you to start seeing results. You will see more significant results if you continue to increase the intensity of these exercises each week."

Ask your internist if you can do waist twists, especially if you have back problems such as scoliosis.,
Do two types of waist twists: The first with full spinal rotation, the other with minimal spinal rotation.

,
Know your spinal flexibility limit.,
Learn the physiological details of spinal construction.,
Limit the repetitions for full range waist twists to five or fewer.,
Spend most of your time doing high repetition waist twists and with your spine fixed or with minimal spinal rotation.,
Do waist twists while holding a light dumbbell or other light object.,
Vary the position of your arms as you do waist twists.,
Schedule these exercises into a routine which will not conflict with other exercise goals.,
Add variety to reap more benefits.,
Practice high repetitions as often a twice a week or as infrequently as once every three weeks.

,
Remember to pace yourself for the course of your lifetime.,
Think long-term.",How to Do Waist Twists,";
,, In preparation for doing full range waist twists, assess your limits. Stay within those limits as you perform the full range twists.

, Look at images of the spine and the little muscles that control bending and rotation. View images of the individual vertebrae and the nerves they protect.

, Performing just a repetition or two would be like a yoga form. Try several different twisting yoga postures. Otherwise, perform the full range waist twist while standing with spine extended (very upright) at a slow to medium speed.

, Do at least 20 repetitions and as many as several hundred.

, This serves to strengthen and balance your musculature.


Racquet sport players, or people who are not ambidextrous, should concentrate on the weak side by swinging a racquet, aerobic dumbbell or light object held in the non-dominant hand.
Freestyle swimmers should breathe on both sides during the rotations.
Golfers and baseball players should do some switch hitting swings in practice to balance their muscles.

, Do a set with a dowel on your shoulders, a set with your arms swinging, a set with your arms out and rigid, and a set with your hands on your hips.

,


If you are pursuing a personal record for crunches, do not try a set of high repetition waist twists before your crunches.
Waist twists work the same muscles that are used for side bends and forward bends, so cut back on your waist twist repetitions when you plan to do these exercises.

,


For high repetition waist twist sets, always start with the basic waist twist. Use impeccable form-- standing very upright-- for at least 20 repetitions. This position will minimize spinal wear and tear and will minimize the possibility of spinal damage.
Vary the exercised groups of muscles in your torso-- back, sides, front.

For the back, do bent-over waist twists or do squat position waist twists.
For the sides, do one-arms swings with a light dumbbell.
To target the front, lean back, with or without support, as you do your waist twists.


Vary your balance and center of gravity.

Shift your weight from side to side and front to back when stationary.
When pressed for time, or as another variation, do waist twists while walking.



,, Choose the frequency of this exercise and the number of repetitions based on what your body is saying at the time. Ramp your repetitions and shorten your between set breaks based on your body feedback. Listen carefully to what your body is saying.


When adding repetitions, at a new workout, do it gradually over time.

, Maintain a well-balanced and total exercise program and include waist twists in that exercise routine.

Afterwards, you can have the campfire and marshmallows and share stories.",How to Make a Survival Course (for Older Kids)," You need to have a place that has a reliable source of edible food, a safe source of water (maybe a pond, spring or lake) and lots of room. Also, if you want to be hosting a campfire afterward (with a parent/guardian), find or make a fireplace in that area. And don't forget to bring along some marshmallows for toasting.;
, If you're in the desert, for example, look up food available in the desert. Whether you're in a forest, a beach, the local woods or alongside a river, do the same.

, Determine how many people are going to be attending. If there are 12 children attending, for example, break them into four groups with three people in each.

, The recommended supplies are: (per group if you're supplying): One pocket knife, a flashlight, blankets (one per person), a plastic bag (for storing food), a bucket and a colored flag. Decide whether you will be supplying the materials or whether this is the responsibility of the children attending. (The flags you will have to supply.)


Be sure to provide a list of appropriate clothing. Layers are usually the best choice, allowing for keeping warm or cooling down, as needed.

, Maybe a few hours, maybe one hour. Decide what is best for everyone. If it's a first time, a shorter course might be suitable, while for children attending an intermediate or advanced course, think of making it longer.

, Send them or give them to everyone you're inviting. If they are bringing the materials, make sure to include what they'll need to pack on the invitation. Also, clarify what clothes they'll need, depending on the weather and the landscape of the area.

, They first go scavenging around for a base. They mark it with a flag, as each group will have a flag of a different color. Then they go looking for food, store it in the bag, and bring it to the base. They can also use the bucket to wash the food.

, Choose a signal (maybe a long whistle) that means to go. Later, everyone will return to the flag once the whistle goes off again, and share their experiences. It is recommended that you have an adult do this job, so that you can participate in the survival course too.

, Maybe discuss ideas for another survival course.

, One respiration consists of one complete rise and fall of the chest, or the inhalation and exhalation of air. The normal respiratory rate for a healthy adult at rest is 12-to-20 breaths per minute.

, Normal respiration consists of deep, even breaths during which the rib cage fully contracts and relaxes. Abnormal respiration may appear shallow and rapid, labored, shallow and deep or noisy and may indicate illness or injury.,, Make a note of any significant changes and relay the information to medical personnel.

Take advantage of the equipment and knowledge available to you through your physical therapist.;
, It is possible to work up your heart rate to your desired level by doing cardio workouts while seated. The following exercises are best performed in a solid chair with no side arms and a straight back.Even if you do not have an injury, following seated cardio routines are a good choice for people that have jobs that require constant sitting.For the following sets of exercises, the suggested number of repetitions is 25 for each exercise, done back to back with very limited resting time.Try wearing a heart monitor. This can help you to adjust your exercise duration to get your heart rate into the zone you want.Calculate your target heart rate by reading this article: How to Calculate Your Target Heart Rate.
Complete three to six rounds of the exercises for a shorter workout. A longer workout includes eight to 12 rounds of the exercises described., The raise the roof exercise is done by using your hands and arms, and pushing forcefully straight upwards.Start with elbows extended straight outward, and both hands at shoulder level. Move quickly and push both hands upwards with some force as if you were raising the roof. Continue for 25 repetitions.Next, alternate pushing upward with one arm then the other, then back. Again, move as quickly and forcefully as you can. Continue for 25 repetitions.To get your heart rate up, you need to put some strength behind the movements and do them quickly., Just as if you had a punching bag hanging to your left side, begin punching that imaginary bag with force and speed using your right arm and with your hand in a fist.Your movement should be fluid and steady, punching across your chest with your right hand and arm. Repeat your right arm punch 25 times.Now switch the imaginary bag to your right side and begin punching with your left arm and hand. Continue for 25 repetitions., Put those imaginary bags on both sides, and punch away, alternating arms.Keep your movements fluid, forceful, and quick. Avoid sloppy movements. Continue for 25 reps., With your arms straight up, generally in the field goal position, angle your wrists and hands slightly inward with your palms facing each other to form an arch shape.Lower your body over to your right side in a slow and gentle swaying motion.Sway back to the left side. This works your abs and your side area. Try to keep your butt planted in the chair and use your side and ab muscles to generate the movement.Exhale as you move down, and inhale as you move up. Repeat the swaying side to side arch movement for 25 reps., Hold both arms straight out from your body to each side, and begin forward directed arm circles. Each revolution of your arm should contain your hand in an area about the size of a dinner plate.Do these fast and furiously, for the 25 reps. Keep breathing as you proceed.Once you have completed your forward circles, do not rest or lower your arms, and immediately begin the same movement only in reverse., This should only be done in a solid chair with a back. You do not want the chair to slip out from under you as you rock backward.Keeping your body as rigid as possible, slowly lean back in the chair allowing your injured leg, cast or boot included, to gently lift from the floor.
Your abs should be the primary muscle group controlling your movement.Now rock forward keeping your body as a unit allowing your abs to do the work.
Do not let your feet touch the floor, then repeat the rocking motion by gently leaning back again.Go slow with this movement and place your hands wherever they feel the most comfortable. Repeat this movement for 12 repetitions., A short workout would include three to six rounds of the exercises as just described.For people that are accustomed to heavy cardio workouts, it may take 8 to 12 rounds to get your heart rate into the desired zone., First, consult with your doctor to be sure you will not do further injury.


Continue with your existing upper body exercise provided there is no pain, no risk of further injury, and your exercise plan has been cleared by your doctor.
For safety reasons, be sure you have someone with you, both at home and at the gym, to guard against falling or further injury.

, Do regular chin-ups using a reverse grip with your palms facing you and your hands a little closer than shoulder-width apart.Pull yourself up until you can touch either your chin or your upper chest to the bar.Do five sets with six repetitions in each set.Be sure someone is with you to help you position yourself gently on the ground when finished with each set.

, A type of chin-up exercise called the gironda sternum exercise works different muscles and is also more difficult to perform.The goal is to position your body in a slant and touch the lower portion of your chest to the bar.Depending on the type of injury you experienced and the form of brace on your leg, this may not be possible. The ability to engage your upper leg muscles is needed to maintain your body in the slant position.If you are able to perform this exercise, do 5 sets with 6 repetitions in each set. Be sure someone is with you for safety., Keeping your injured leg straight instead of bent, position yourself so your legs are either flat on the ground or resting on a slightly raised bench.The injured leg needs to remain straight, but the uninjured leg can be bent at the standard 90 degree angle.Place your hands on either side of your head but do not lock your fingers behind your head.Push your lower back into the floor, and slowly lift or roll your shoulders off the floor. Do not raise your shoulders more that about 4 inches from the floor.Focus on slow and controlled movements while keeping your lower back pressed to the floor to get the greatest benefit.Do five sets with 30 reps in each set., Position your body so that your toes are on the ground and your hands are directly beneath your shoulders.Keeping your back straight and your head level, push yourself up from the ground.Lower your body back towards the ground until you feel a stretch in your chest and shoulder area. Hold that position for one second, then push your body upwards keeping your back and head straight.Repeat five sets with 20 repetitions in each set.Depending on the type of injury and the type of cast, this may not be a good choice for you. Any exercise that causes pain at your injury site should not be done., Be sure you can do this safely. Your healthy leg will need to be very strong for you to do this exercise, and you'll need to have excellent balance and mobility.It may help to have a friend standing beside you so you can grab her arm if you lose your balance. Make sure your ankle in particular is warmed up and flexible.Keeping your back straight, lower yourself down to a sitting position, with the thigh of your good leg at a 90 degree angle to your hips.
Keep your injured leg in a straight position out in front of you, parallel to the floor.Return to a standing position using the strength in your uninjured leg.

, Some household chores require good foot cushioning and stability in order to perform them without the risk of injury.

, The forward and back motion of vacuuming is a great workout for your abdominal muscles (abs). Flex your muscles 1 at a time, beginning at your pelvis and moving into your upper abs, and keep them flexed for the entire duration of your vacuuming.


You burn approximately 190 calories per hour vacuuming. Increase the calories you burn by performing single leg lunges every 2 to 3 minutes. Take a large step forward with your right leg and lunge until your right knee is at a 90 degree angle. Hold the position for 3 to 10 seconds and then step back. Repeat with your left leg.

, Ready the floors so you can do as many surfaces as possible in succession. Flex your ab muscles and squat rather than bend if you need to get into a hard to reach space.


Mopping burns approximately 195 calories per hour. Make sure you switch arms as you sweep, mop or rake. You should reach and pull back with your right and left sides evenly. Favoring 1 side will create a muscle imbalance and may lead to pain. Get on your hands and knees and scrub intensely. This cleaning exercise works your shoulders and upper arms intensely.

, You can do this while tidying different rooms, bringing objects from 1 room to another. You can also do it simply to burn more calories and increase the intensity of your workout.


You burn approximately 500 calories per hour walking up and down stairs. Increase your strength-training by squatting whenever you pick up objects.

Use a heart-rate monitor or take your pulse on your wrist or using the carotid artery in your neck.
Use your index and third fingers to measure your pulse, not your thumb. Place these fingers on your neck beside your windpipe to use your carotid artery, or between the bone and tendon on the thumb-side of your wrist to use your radial artery.
Before you start counting, set a timer to go off after 30 seconds. You won't be able to count beats and keep track of the time as well. You also can use a watch with a second hand, provided you can look at it without losing count of the beats.
When 30 seconds is up, take the number of beats you counted and multiply it by two to find your resting heart rate.
The average adult has a resting heart rate somewhere between 60 and 100 bpm. If the number you get is way outside that range, you may want to check your pulse again to make sure you didn't lose count.
Keep in mind that your resting heart rate can change over time, especially if you start engaging in regular exercise or make other lifestyle changes. Measure it once a week so you can adjust your calculations as needed.;
, Your maximum heart rate is the highest heart rate you can achieve without severe problems. The maximum doesn't really change relative to your physical fitness, but it does decrease with age.However, attaining your maximum heart rate will require less exertion if you are not very physically fit.


The intensity of your exercise is measured as a percentage of your maximum heart rate. To find your maximum heart rate, take your age and subtract it from 220.
For example, if you are 30 years old, your maximum heart rate would be 190 (220 – 30 = 190).

, Your HRR is the difference between your resting heart rate and your maximum heart rate. This number represents the amount of heartbeats available for you to safely exercise.To find your HRR, subtract your resting heart rate from your maximum heart rate.
For example, if you are 30 years old and had a resting heart rate of 75 bpm, your HRR would be 115 bpm (maximum heart rate of 190 bpm – resting heart rate of 75 bpm = 115 bpm).

, For moderate-intensity exercise, your heart rate should be between 50 and 70 percent of your maximum heart rate. Vigorous exercise means your heart rate is from 70 to 85 percent of your maximum heart rate.Calculate the low end of your target range by multiplying your HRR by 50 percent (0.5) and adding that number to your resting heart rate. To continue with the previous example, a 30-year-old with an HRR of 115 bpm and a resting heart rate of 75 bpm would need a heart rate of at least 132.5 bpm (115 x 0.5 = 57.5; 57.5 + 75 = 132.5) for the activity in which they were engaging to qualify as moderate-intensity exercise.
From there, you can decide what you want your high end to be. If you want to stay in the moderate-intensity range, perform the same calculation using 70 percent.
To find your target for vigorous-intensity exercise, perform the same calculation, but multiply your HRR 80 percent.
Especially if you're just starting an exercise program after leading a mostly sedentary lifestyle, it can be helpful to find the number for the top end of the vigorous-intensity range so you'll know if you're overdoing it.

Choose a moderate-intensity aerobic activity.,
Exercise for 10 minutes.,
Take your pulse.,
Compare your heart rate to your target numbers and adjust accordingly.,
Take other factors into account.",How to Measure Exercise Intensity2," Walking at a brisk pace is generally considered a moderately intense exercise – although this may not be true for you if you're out of shape or have heart or respiratory issues.Many ordinary daily activities, such as gardening or cleaning your house, also are considered moderate-intensity activities.
Other physical activities that typically qualify as moderate-intensity activities include cycling (provided you're traveling less than 10 mph or 16 kph) playing with children, practicing yoga, golf, or ballroom dancing.
Keep in mind that the line between moderate and vigorous can blur for some of these activities. For example, playing with children generally is a moderate-intensity activity, but if those children are running at an all-out sprint and you're chasing them, you're crossing over the vigorous-intensity threshold. Likewise, gardening typically is a moderately intense activity, but with continuous digging or hoeing it can progress to a vigorously intense activity.

, If you want to stay in your target zone, begin your moderately intense aerobic activity and set a timer or a stop watch so you can stop and check your pulse after you've been exercising for a brief period of time.Once you've been exercising more frequently, you won't have to stop as often. However, if you're just getting started it's better to stop at 10-minute intervals so you can make sure you're staying in the zone.
If you've been doing the same sort of activity for several weeks, you may not have to stop at all. You'll become accustomed to how it feels to be in the intensity zone you want.

, If you don't have a heart-rate monitor, take your pulse using the radial artery in your rest or the carotid artery in your neck so you can find out your heart rate after 10 minutes of exercise.Many cell phones are also capable of measuring your heart rate.


Your radial artery is located between the bone and tendon on the thumb side of your wrist. It doesn't make any difference which arm you use. Your carotid artery can be found to the side of your windpipe on your throat.
Use your index and third fingers to check your pulse, not your thumb. Apply light pressure, but don't squeeze. Breathe normally.
You can keep time with a watch that has a second hand, but you may want to set a timer on your mobile phone if you have a hard time watching the second hand without counting.
You can count the heartbeats for 15 seconds, or for 30. If you took your pulse for 15 seconds, multiply by 4 to get your bpm. If you took your pulse for 30 seconds, you would multiply by 2.

, Your heart rate tells you whether the activity you're doing is moderate or vigorous for you, or if you are overworking yourself. Use this information to stay in your target zone.For example, suppose you previously calculated your target heart rate for moderate intensity exercise as 140 bpm. After 10 minutes of brisk walking, you take your pulse and find that your heart rate is 150 bpm. Provided that rate doesn't fall into the vigorous range for you, there's no need for you to adjust your activity.
If your heart rate is significantly higher than your target range, slow down your activity until your heart rate falls into the appropriate range. Don't resume activity at the same level. It may take some trial and error to find your sweet spot.
On the other hand, if your heart rate falls below the bottom line you calculated for moderate-intensity activity, you need to go a little harder to reach the appropriate zone. Again, you'll have to go by trial and error. For example, your heart rate may initially be too fast, but then when you slow down you find that after ten minutes your heart rate is now too slow.
Once you can consistently perform within the target range, take stock of how your body feels so you know what it feels like to be in the target zone and you can get there without having to constantly check your heart rate, which can interrupt the flow of your exercise routine.

, Exercise is not the only thing that affects your heart rate. Particularly if you're exercising outside, the weather conditions may play a role. Health conditions and other issues, both internal and external, may increase or decrease your heart rate.Your heart rate fluctuates throughout the day. If you took your resting heart rate first thing in the morning, but you're exercising in the late afternoon, you may want to get another resting heart rate during the time you'd ordinarily be exercising and make sure there's not a significant difference. If there is, do your calculations again.
Certain types of foods and drinks, especially those that contain sugar or caffeine, can affect your heart rate. This is also the case with some medications.
Stress or anxiety can increase your heart rate, and your natural hormone fluctuations also may play a role.

Try to talk.,
Check your breath rate.,
Evaluate how much you're sweating.,
Consider your relative fitness level.",How to Measure Exercise Intensity3," If you're not up for making several calculations and repeatedly checking your pulse, the ""talk test"" is one of the simplest and most straightforward ways to measure exercise intensity. All you have to do is figure out how easy it is for you to speak aloud.If you can sing while engaging in an activity, your body probably isn't working hard enough for the activity to qualify as moderately intense exercise.
If you can carry on a conversation, you are engaging in moderately intense exercise. Think of going for a brisk walk with a friend and talking as you walk, or talking on the phone as you walk.
With vigorous exercise, you can still speak, but you aren't able to say more than a word or two without stopping to catch your breath.
You're exercising too hard if you're unable to speak at all while conducting the activity. Slow down and take a break.

, How fast and how hard you're breathing is another way to measure exercise intensity, provided you don't have any pre-existing respiratory conditions that affect the way you breathe.With moderate intensity exercise, your breath will quicken, but you won't feel out of breath.
Vigorous exercise will feel more challenging. You should be breathing deeply and rapidly.
If you're continuously have trouble catching your breath, start wheezing or coughing, or feel chest pain and pressure, stop exercising immediately. Your body is working too hard.

, In most cases, you can effectively gauge the intensity of your exercise based on how much you're sweating. This method only really works indoors in a climate-controlled environment, however – when you're outside, there are many other factors that could contribute to how much you're sweating.The temperature of the air around you while you're exercising is the most obvious outside factor that will contribute to how much you sweat. If you're walking outside in the middle of the summer when it's hot, for example, you'll sweat a lot more than you would if you were doing the same thing during winter.
Generally, with moderately intense exercise, you should experience light to moderate sweating.
If you're exercising vigorously, you should be sweating heavily. However, if you're sweating profusely, to the point that you could wring out your clothing, you're probably working too hard – especially if you're indoors in a climate-controlled environment.

, Ultimately, how intense you are exercising is a subjective measure. If you're out of shape, a brisk walk may be vigorous exercise for you. But for someone in peak physical condition, a brisk walk would be easy.For this reason, use caution when you see lists of activities that are labeled as ""moderate"" or ""vigorous."" These labels typically apply to a relatively healthy person, and may not be accurate for you.
Despite anything you read, go at your own pace – especially if you're just starting out. For example, you may have read that cycling at over 10 mph (about 16 kph) qualifies as vigorous exercise. However, you are working up a sweat and find it hard to say more than a word or two at a time if you cycle at half that speed. That's your vigorous exercise.
As you become more fit, physical activity will be easier for you. At that point, you'll know it's time to increase your effort.

Find a tape measure.,
Wrap the tape around the thickest part of your thigh.,
Pull the tape between your knee and your buttocks.,
Avoid holding the tape too tightly.",How to Measure Your Thighs1," You should use a flexible body tape measure, such as the type that a tailor would use. Do not use a retracting tape measure, like the ones used in construction or for measuring furniture. The tape should not stretch when pulled or bent.You can also use a string and a ruler. Wrap the string the same way you would a tape measure. Mark the length of the string used, and measure it against a ruler.;
, Stand with your legs straight. Find the thickest part of your thigh. This is your upper thigh, right under the buttocks. Start the tape at the front of your thigh and wrap it around towards the back before bringing it back to the front.Mark the number at the point where the tape measure meets itself., If you need to measure the length of your thigh, start the tape at the back of your knee and pull it straight up along the back of your thigh. Mark the measurement just where your buttocks begin. You may need to have a friend do this measurement for you., When measuring with a tape or string, the tape should press lightly against your skin, but you should not hold it so tightly that it sinks into your skin."
"
Find a pair of calipers.,
Locate the midpoint of your thigh.,
Bend your knee.,
Pinch and pull the skin.,
Measure with calipers.,
Use these measurements to calculate body fat.",How to Measure Your Thighs2," You will need a pair of skinfold calipers, also known as body fat calipers. These are sold in most fitness stores. These calipers may come with digital readers or analog dials.

Calipers may sometimes give measurements that are higher than your actual body fat.A doctor or personal trainer may have more accurate methods of body fat measurements available, including water displacement methods, body fat scales, or DEXA scanning., Find the midpoint between your knee and your hip on the front of your thigh.You can roughly find this by stretching your hand with your pinky on the top of your knee and your thumb towards the middle of your thigh. You can also use a measuring tape to measure the length of your thigh and mark the halfway point.

Once you find this spot, you may want to mark it with a felt-tipped pen so that you can remember it when you have the calipers ready.

, For the best accuracy, you should bend your knee so that your leg forms a 90 degree angle. The best way to do this is to sit on a chair or bench.You can also stand and bend back your knee, resting your foot behind you on a box or chair., Pinch the tissue so that you have a small vertical fold of skin. To do this, your fingers should be side by side as you pinch, not one over the other. As you grasp the tissue, gently tug it forward., Press on the calipers to close the tips around the fold of your thigh. Release the handle when done. The calipers should be just below your fingers. The dial may rapidly swing before settling. Once, the dial has settled, read the measurements.If you do not have calipers, you may be able to get a rough measurement by measuring the distance between your fingers with a ruler.You may need a friend to help with this.

, If you are interested in the body fat percentage, you can calculate your overall body fat. You can use an online calculator to find a rough estimate of your overall body fat, or you can do the math yourself. If you're not interested in the percentage but just want to track how your thigh fat changes, write down the measurement, and keep track of it over time.To use a formula, men should measure their body fat at their abs, chest, and thighs. Women should measure at their triceps, suprailiac, and thighs.There are many different formulas you can use to calculate body fat percentage, such as the Jackson and Pollack formula."

Devise a basic business plan in which you lay out a model of what you'll be offering including a time line, number of students you plan to teach, number of classes you will teach each week, price per session or individual class, marketing plan and class venue.,
Purchase a few necessities for your classes including a battery-operated CD boom box to play music during the classes and a handful of exercise music CDs; you'll carry the boom box on your own stroller to keep music going for the duration of the class.,
Offer an open house at a free or low-cost local venue like a community center, bank with a meeting room, a church or a park picnic pavilion.,
Create exercise routines to fit several time frames so you can offer a variety of classes.,
Reassess your success after your first couple sessions to determine your future plans.",How to Make Money With a Stroller Fitness Class," You'll also need to determine how much money you can spend for set-up and advertising.


Research other courses in your area to see what the going rate is for exercise classes both at big gyms, the local YMCA and community centers. Because you won't have the overhead many of these places have, consider charging slightly less than these other classes.
Your start-up costs can be minimal if you utilize a local park for outdoor classes or mall for indoor classes, do your marketing mostly online using social media and word-of-mouth via fliers posted at churches, community centers and daycare centers.
You'll need both indoor and outdoor class venues for days of inclement weather.
Most city-run parks and recreation departments offer low-cost courses at their community centers and parks. Offer to teach a sanctioned course for them within their seasonal offerings, usually three times per year: spring, summer, and fall/winter. This will cost you a small portion of your profit, but you'll be included in course materials they distribute to the entire community.;
, Ask the students to bring their own exercise mats, set of exercise bands and jump rope, but you'll also want to have three or four of each for those students who forget to bring them to class.

, During the open house, you can offer a 15-minute free trial session to let people try your program.


People attending open houses always like to have a chance at prizes, so offer a few door prizes. These could include a coupon for 20 percent off enrollment, a workout mat or even prizes donated to you by friends with their own small businesses.

, You'll need a 30-minute beginner routine, a 45-minute intermediate routine and an hour-long advanced routine. Offer each type of class in a set number of weeks and number of classes per week, such as three times per week for eight weeks. You can then take a couple weeks off while you hold registration for your next set of classes.


Within these time frames, you'll need to have a few variations prepared so your students don't get bored doing the same routine at every class. Remember to have plenty of cardio time in the way of walking as this keeps the strollers moving. (The babies need a change of scenery and might get bored easily if you stay in one place for too long.)
The more variety you have, the greater the chances of having return students when each session is complete. Include a program that is primarily cardio, one that is a mix of cardio and strength training and one that is a mix of cardio and flexibility with stretching.

, You may choose to continue offering classes on your own, or decide if you want to take the next step of becoming part of a national stroller fitness franchise.


Being part of a franchise will provide you access to additional marketing opportunities, business-building resources and interaction with other stroller fitness instructors and business owners in your area and in the country.

Slide the rope through the handles.,
Secure the ends of the ropes to the handles.,
Singe the tips of cloth ropes slightly.Use a lighter and quickly insert the ends of the rope into the flame.,
Try out the jump rope to test the length.,
Adjust the rope.",How to Make a Jump Rope," You can select from a variety of materials that can work as a rope. You can get an actual rope from your local hardware store, or you can use ropes made of leather, PVC, or elastic.


Different fabrics of rope will have an effect on the speed, durability and versatility of your rope.For example, leather ropes are great for speed, but can feel like a whip when it hits your skin, so it's not a great choice for children.;
, Measure the length from the top of your chest to your feet. Multiply it times two. The total number will give you a good length to cut your rope.


If you are not making the jump rope for yourself you will need to get those measurements from the person you are making the jump rope for.
If you can't get a measurement, you can just go with a 7-foot rope for most children. For people between 5'2""-5'6"" you can use an 8-foot rope. From 5'6""-6'2"" you can use a 9-foot rope. And for people taller than 6'3"" go with a 10-foot rope.You can always adjust the knots to shorten the rope later on, so it's best to have a little extra length to begin with.
You will want to use a much longer rope if you plan to do double dutch jumping. A rope of 12 feet will be sufficient for one jumper, and add 2-4 feet for each additional jumper., Handles will have a big impact on how your jump rope performs. You can purchase some handles at a sporting goods store, or make some yourself using items around your home.


To make some handles at home you can cut two pieces of 1/2-inch PVC pipe in equal lengths of 4-8 inches depending on your preference. Drill a hole in two 1/2 inch PVC end caps that is wide enough for your rope.
You could also cut a wooden dowel into similar lengths. Drill a hole that is wide enough for your rope through the center of the dowel.If you are making a jump rope for children, you will want the handle to be small and light enough for a child to hold easily.
If you are making a jump rope as a piece of exercise equipment, you will get more benefit by using handles that have some more weight. This will challenge your arm muscles more when you exercise.

, Jump rope beads serve several different purposes. They make the jump rope more visible, which is desirable for performances and safer for children. The beads also make a louder sound when they hit the ground, which helps some jump ropers to keep a good rhythm. Beads can also add a little weight to a rope which can alter the feel and performance. They also help to protect the rope.

, You can paint the handles your favorite color. Adding some tassels to the ends of the handles can make the jump rope even more exciting for kids. You can even find beads with letters to personalize the rope.

, If you are using beads, you will need to slide the rope through them first, then secure the ends with the handles.


Try alternating colors. Select two different colors of beads. Slide on a bead of one color, then the other color. Repeat until the rope is full.

, Take one of the rope and feed it through one handle. Then take the opposite end of the rope and feed it through the other end of the rope. Be sure the handle ends face opposite directions at each end of the rope.

, How you secure the rope will vary depending on your rope and handle choice. Some cord ropes will come with a cap that tightens or crimps around the cord to hold it to the handle.For most cloth and elastic materials you can simply tie a knot at each end of the rope so that the ends will not slip through the handles.


To tie the rope hold it in front of you several inches from the end of the rope. With your other hand make a loop on one side of the rope, bringing the end behind the bulk of the rope. Make another loop on the other side of the rope, bringing the end across in front of the rope. Then pull the end through the top loop and tighten. This knot will stay secured until you untie it., The fabric will harden and seal the tips to prevent them from fraying. You can also dip them in glue to help seal the ends of the ropes.

, If the rope seems too long then you can adjust the jump rope as needed.


Having a longer rope than necessary will mean the rope will take longer to rotate. This can be beneficial for new jumpers or children. Conversely, if you are an experienced jumper and looking to increase your speed, you will want the rope to have as little excess rope as possible.

, Pull the unwanted length of rope through the handle. Try using the rope again. When it seems like a good length, tie a knot at one end of the rope again and cut off the excess with a pair of scissors. If you have clips for your handles you can simply adjust them and trim away the excess.


Some handles have extra room so you can make a loop in the rope to adjust the size and fit the loop within the body of the handle. If your handles have the space, you might want to consider using this method to resize your rope. It is quicker and will give you the ability to add some length back to the rope later on if you want.

Even if it appears the ashes and wood aren’t hot, they may remain warm and capable of starting a fire for some time. Allow several hours for the embers to cool. They will not radiate any heat when they are completely cold.Don’t allow a fire to keep burning overnight. If you need to go to sleep, put the embers out completely by covering them with sand.
Pouring water on a fire inside can damage your fireplace. If sand is not available, you can smother a fire with flour.;
, Let your campsite embers cool completely in your firepit. Do not leave your camping area with any warm embers still radiating heat. If you need to put your embers out quickly, smother them with sand or dirt.Don’t start an outdoor fire if you don’t have time to let the embers cool properly.
Avoid putting out your fire with water, which can wash away flammable accelerant., Wearing safety gloves, use a metal shovel to move the ashes into a metal bucket. Move the bucket close to the site of the fire, so you are not transferring ashes over your wood floor indoors or longer distances outside. Act as though the material still has the potential to be warm, even if you think it’s cool.Never use buckets or shovels made of any combustible materials, such as wood.

, Use a water bottle or watering can to wet down your ashes and any wood pieces in the bucket. Use enough water to saturate the materials in the bucket, so they are thoroughly wet. Do this whether you are inside or outside. If desired, you can put a plastic trash bag underneath your bucket inside to protect your floor.There’s no need to have standing water in the bucket, but it doesn’t hurt. As long as you’re okay with a little mess, you can use as much water as you like.

, Place your metal bucket of fire waste outside your home. Choose a location away from any combustible materials, such as oil or paper.

You can retest and add more ash over the coming months, as desired.Before adding ashes, measure the starting PH of your garden soil with a soil PH meter. These can be purchased inexpensively online. How much ash to add depends on the starting PH of your soil, but most plants thrive at a PH between 6-7.5.Adding ash will neutralize acids in your soil, so only add it if your starting PH is higher than 7.
You can do this with damp or dry ashes; it is up to you.

, The alkalinity of ashes repels slugs and snails. If you have prized plants that are being nibbled by these creatures, sprinkle a handful of ash at the base of the plant. Avoid adding more than a handful, as this can change the PH of your soil and affect plant growth. Your garden will be pest free in no time., Sprinkle some leftover ashes on stubborn ice in the winter. Its composition helps the ice melt faster, and it provides some much needed traction on slippery areas. Plus, it’s a natural alternative to many chemical ice melts that can be harmful to pets and children., Mix 1 cup of ashes (144 grams) with a little bit of water until you have a thick paste.

Decline press up (feet on a chair),
Diamond press up (create a diamond shape with both hands whilst performing normal push-ups),
Squats,
Lunges (take turns altering between both legs whilst bending the knee),
Pull- up,
Chin-up,
Bur-pees,
Standard plank (balance whole body using arms and feet on the ground,whilst stomach and back are slightly elevated form the floor),
Side plank,
Dips,
Tricep dips (place hand on the edge of chair with feet stretched out and only use arms to lift yourself up and down)and finally
Inverted rows (pull yourself up whilst holding onto a chair).



,


It is more effective to do three sets of lower repetitions, for e,g. 3 sets of 6 incline press ups.

, Once you've made your plan, print it out or save it accessibly on your computer and mobile devices. That way, it's on hand so that you can follow it daily. Being consistent will really help you see results!

, Make sure to alternate between exercises in a session instead of completing one fully and then moving onto the next.

, Otherwise, lactic acid is bound to build up and cause burning sensations in your muscles during workouts, which may slow down your overall athletic progression.

Visit several gyms.,
Choose a CrossFit gym that meets your needs.,
Start with a cardio class.,
Adapt workouts to fit your current capabilities.,
Complete an Elements or Foundations clinic.,
Increase your intensity gradually.",How to Make Crossfit Less Intimidating1," Every CrossFit affiliate is unique. Before you get started, spend time at several in your area. Observe the workouts and make an effort to speak to the coaches at each location.If you live in a larger city, you may have dozens of CrossFit gyms to choose from. Visit their websites to narrow the list down to five or six you want to take a closer look at.
You may want to visit more than one time before you commit to a particular location, especially if you're more intimidated by the CrossFit experience. Take the time you need to get comfortable in the location so you can observe the workouts and the interactions among the athletes without much intimidation.
Think about any other time you've been intimidated by something unfamiliar where you were worried about how you would fit in, such as starting a new job or a new school. Once things became a little more familiar, you were no longer intimidated. This is what you should keep in mind as you're evaluating different gyms.;
, Talk to the coaches and other staff members, and make sure their coaching styles and goals mesh with your fitness goals and your overall fitness level.After you've visited several gyms, you're better able to compare and contrast to find the one that seems like it would be the best fit for you.
If, after visiting several gyms, you still haven't found one where you think you could eventually feel comfortable, you may need to go to some other places.

, Many CrossFit gyms have cardio classes, which use body-weight exercises rather than incorporating heavy weightlifting. You don't need any training on CrossFit form and technique, so these can be a less intimidating introduction to CrossFit.Cardio classes also focus more on muscle tone and fat burning. If you're concerned about your fitness level or want to shed a few pounds before you get fully into CrossFit, these classes can be a good introduction.
Keep in mind that you'll still be challenged by these classes – there will just be less of a focus on strength-training. But if you've never lifted weights before, that may be the most intimidating part of CrossFit for you.

, Even if you're a seasoned athlete, CrossFit workouts are challenging – and they're designed to be so. Make sure you're not trying to do more than you're currently capable of handling to avoid injury.In CrossFit lingo, you may hear coaches or athletes talk about ""scaling"" a workout. In introductory classes, the coaches will be able to help you scale the workout to better match your fitness level.
As your fitness improves, you'll be able to increase the resistance and speed with which you perform the workouts. Maintain a realistic assessment of your capabilities, and try not to push yourself too hard – especially when you're just starting out.
Remember that even the most hard-core and experienced CrossFit athlete was a beginner at one point. They understand what you're going through and won't expect you to immediately be competitive the first day you step into the box.

, Elements clinics are not workouts. Rather, they are hands-on clinics that teach you the correct form and technique for performing CrossFit workouts. Strong form is essential to prevent injury.These classes typically start with a warm up, then move to a specific skill or movement. Your coach will demonstrate proper technique, and then you'll get an opportunity to perform the movement yourself.
In most gyms, you can take these classes as long as necessary, until you feel comfortable with the movements and can perform them with perfect form. In some gyms, you may need permission from a coach before you can move on to ""on ramp"" classes, which further prepare you for the intensity of CrossFit.
As with Foundations classes, you typically can stay in the ""on ramp"" level as long as you need, until you feel comfortable advancing or your coach has given you clearance to advance.

, Many CrossFit workouts are essentially a race against the clock, so the intensity level of those workouts – and the athletes attacking them – can be extremely intimidating when you first get involved.Stay in introductory classes as long as you need to, and only advance when you feel comfortable doing so. Count on your coach to help you recognize when you're ready to advance.
Avoid comparing yourself to athletes who are more advanced and more experienced. Try to focus on your coaches, and compete with others who are at your own fitness level.
Expect to experience intense muscle soreness for several weeks after you start doing CrossFit regularly. Learn good recovery techniques from the start to reduce your risk of strain and injury later on.

Get to know the people in your class.,
Learn the language.,
Support other athletes.,
Talk to coaches and more experienced athletes.",How to Make Crossfit Less Intimidating2," CrossFit gyms are in many ways small communities unto themselves. By fostering a spirit of camaraderie, each gym builds a supportive network that can help you achieve new heights in strength and endurance.During your early Foundations or Elements clinics, the coach will likely include a series of icebreaker exercises that are designed to allow the participants in the class to get to know each other. Be open and try to avoid making any judgements or assumptions about anyone based on their appearance.
Ask questions, both of your coach and of other participants. If you have an opportunity to hang out with any of the participants socially, such as a trip to get smoothies after the clinic, take advantage of it.
If you have a sports background, think of how you got to know your teammates and approach CrossFit the same way. These people may not necessarily become your best friends, but you'll be more supportive of people with whom you're familiar. The first step to encouragement is understanding someone's struggles.

, CrossFit has its own lingo, and part of getting acclimated and feeling less intimidating is learning the correct terminology and using it naturally and appropriately. If you don't understand something, ask rather than assuming.One of the first things you'll learn is ""WOD,"" which stands for ""workout of the day."" Some workouts have unique names that you'll also learn with time. For example, there are a series of WODs that have each been given a girl's name. After awhile, when you see one of these names you'll immediately know what your daily training regimen will be.
Another acronym you'll encounter frequently is ""AMRAP,"" which stands for ""as many reps as possible."" Many WODs include exercises done this way. Rather than race the clock, you'll be focused on doing as many reps of the given exercise as you can within a specified amount of time.
Many CrossFit athletes also follow the Paleo diet, which consists essentially of eating as cavemen from the Paleolithic period did – primarily meat and vegetables. Followers of the Paleo diet have their own lingo as well, which may overlap with CrossFit lingo.

, Even though CrossFit is by its very nature competitive, the CrossFit community is very supportive and encouraging. Foster a healthy spirit of competition by congratulating your fellow CrossFitters for achieving personal bests or meeting their own goals.Part of this culture of support includes being willing to check your ego. Getting cocky about your performance is a sure way to slack on your form and end up injured.
Keep everything in perspective and realize that one athlete who bests you in one skill may struggle in another. Be willing to help out and avoid negative feelings and resentment that can turn healthy competition into a bitter rivalry.

, At first blush, CrossFit athletes may seem intense and overwhelming, and you may find it difficult to imagine that they could be warm and welcoming to a beginner like you. But most CrossFitters are encouraging to new members and happy to welcome you into their fold.CrossFit gyms often have community events. Many also have a presence on social media. Use these to seek out and ask advice from coaches and experienced athletes, especially when you're just getting started.
When you enter a CrossFit box for the first time, there no doubt will be particular individuals who you find the most intimidating – maybe because they look particularly strong, because they are overwhelmingly intense, or they seem to know everybody. Start with the most intimidating person in the gym and ask them a question. The more you get to know them, the less intimidating they will be.

Seek out CrossFit-friendly media sources.,
Be patient.,
Go with a friend.,
Set reachable goals.,
Give it 30 days.",How to Make Crossfit Less Intimidating3," Even if you're somewhat interested in CrossFit, part of your intimidation may come from the fact that you've read articles about the dangers of participation, the pain, and the freak injuries CrossFitters experience.You can find websites online designed for CrossFitters, and you also can find information on the websites and social media pages of CrossFit gyms. Talk to people locally who do CrossFit and get recommendations from them for where you can go for more information.
When you're first learning about CrossFit, you typically will see videos and images of athletes performing amazing feats of strength and endurance. You may think that those feats are well beyond your capabilities, or that you need to be more in shape before you can even start CrossFit. Looking at real images and videos from regular gyms, and talking to actual CrossFitters, can help you overcome that intimidating image.

, You won't be going in on your first day and doing the same things the most experienced athletes can do. Gradually, over time, you will improve your fitness in a supportive and accepting environment.Keep in mind that any type of vigorous exercise is potentially dangerous if not done properly. Because of the intense focus on form and technique, injuries are no more common in CrossFit than in any other similarly vigorous activity.
Your CrossFit coaches won't allow you to progress to the next level unless they feel your form and technique are correct. Listen to them and be patient. Understand that it will take time to reach the level where you want to be.

, One of the easiest ways to make CrossFit less intimidating is to start with someone else. Get involved with someone you know who also is interested in CrossFit and is at a fitness level similar to you.


If you have a friend who's already involved in CrossFit, going with them can also make it less intimidating. However, make sure you evaluate the gym for your own purposes – don't go to a gym that makes you feel intimidated or uncomfortable just because your friend is a member there.
Even if you and an experienced friend don't go to the same gym, they still can answer your questions and help you become more familiar with the CrossFit world. Remember that familiarity is the key to erasing intimidation.

, One of the most important parts of CrossFit training is to avoid trying to do too much too fast. Scale your workouts to suit your fitness level and set small goals that can be reached at each session and you'll find steady improvement in your fitness.As you progress in CrossFit, you'll find that other aspects of your lifestyle will also come into play. Most CrossFit gyms have other supports, such as nutrition guidance and skills clinics, to help you in those areas.
Work with the coaches at your gym to set milestones to celebrate as you progress through training. The process will become less and less intimidating as you start to see results and find yourself meeting and exceeding your goals and expectations.

, The first week or so of CrossFit typically will be difficult and challenging. To overcome your intimidation, you should be willing to give it a little more time and allow it to become a part of your regular routine.It can take you as long as a month to become comfortable with the movements and start to feel like you know what you're doing. The simple act of showing up for a month will give you more confidence and make the process and the environment seem less intimidating.
If after a month you've decided that CrossFit isn't for you, at least you'll be able to make an informed decision at that point, and won't have to wonder whether you missed out on something because you were too scared to give it a shot.

Find the right location for a fire.,
Prepare the fire site.,
Gather the necessary materials and assemble them.,
Scrape the magnesium bar.,
Strike the flint to create spark.,
Encourage the development of a flame.,
Maintain the fire.,
Extinguish the fire before you leave.",How to Use a Fire Starter," Not every place is suitable for a fire, either because it can be difficult to start or because of the dangers involved.Try to find a place out of the wind. A breeze can blow out fires that you attempt to start or spread fires out of control. If you can, find a sheltered area where it will not be a factor.
Look for a location that is near a supply of fuel (presumably wood). Fires can be surprisingly ""hungry,"" and it is impractical to carry heavy wood great distances.
Find an area where this is little chance of fire spreading. Try to find a clearing or area with little grass and some distance (a few yards/meters) from any trees or overhanging branches.;
, In order to discourage the spread of fire, you must clear the area around the intended fire site.


Small dug-out fire pits were once a common way of limited the reach of fire. Make the pit a bit larger than the intended fire in order to maintain distance between the flame and any grass.Alternatively, mound fires are commonly advocated among the Boy Scouts and other outdoor enthusiasts today.As the name suggests, you start by building a mound of sand or dirt (again, larger than the intended fire). This elevates it above the surrounding grass or other materials that cannot always be sufficiently cleared).
If you cannot get out of the wind, prepare a windbreak for the fire. Perhaps an old damp log can be used to limit the effect of the wind on your fire site. If you do chose a potentially flammable material for your windbreak, make sure there is sufficient distance to prevent it from catching on fire.

, You must be able to both start and sustain a fire. If you have chosen your location wisely, there should be plenty of fuel around. That is not all that is needed to start a fire, however.If you are using wood, you will not start by lighting large branches on fire. Instead, you must gather kindling, including such dried materials as leaves, conifer needles, and small twigs.
You should also assemble the kindling and some medium-sized branches (roughly the size of an adult finger) in the selected fire site. The kindling will burn quickly, and even if you can add more kindling to the initial fire there must be something in place to sustain the flames. Organize this before you try to start your fire.

, The magnesium bar is a really remarkable camping or survival tool. Magnesium is an incredibly flammable material, and in certain circumstances ignited magnesium has known to reach temperatures of over 5,000 °F (2,760 °C). Obviously, something that burns with this intensity can rapidly create a powerful fire.If you are using a knife, try to use the back of the blade if you can; you don't want to damage the knife edge, and you are also not trying to cut slivers out of the bar. You want small flakes that will ignite easily.
It can be difficult to determine the quantity of magnesium necessary to start a fire. Too little and you won't succeed in starting a fire; too much and you'll have a 5000 degree fireball in your face. That said, it might be good to start small and then, only if that fails, add more scrapings.

, Usually one side of these magnesium bars contains a flint strip. Scrape that with your knife to create a spark.


The quantity of spark will be determined by the amount of force applied, the speed of the strike, and the angle of attack (degree at which the blade runs along the flint).
Do not stab or slash at the flint. Drag the blade across the flint or, if you prefer, drag the flint over the edge of the knife while keeping the blade steady. The latter method may be safer.

, If the kindling immediately ignites and catches fire, congratulations. If it instead smokes and smolders, you may need to gently blow onto the kindling until embers ignite into proper flames.

, Use larger branches after the fire has become established. Watch it closely to make sure it does not burn out of control or sparks do not spread to nearby fuel sources.

, Make sure you douse the fire in water and stir the ashes until you are sure all embers are put out."

Choose a location for dry wood storage.,
Prevent wood from getting wet again.,
Keep firewood off the ground.,
Check local regulations.",How to Store Firewood Outdoors1," You'll likely want to store your wood close to where you're burning it for the sake of convenience. A storage shed, covered porch, the side of your house under the eaves, in a barn, or even a lean-to are all excellent spots.


If the location you've chosen for your firewood is somewhat distant from where you'll be burning, you may want to use a wheelbarrow or wood carrier to help transporting it.
Your wood doesn't have to be completely protected from the elements. Exposure to wind, sun, and even a little bit of rain seems to improve drying times.;
, Although a little bit of rain may help your wood dry faster, wood that is already dry can be protected with a tarp. Only cover the top ¼ of your wood with a tarp to maintain good airflow and prevent decay., Being in direct contact dirt will cause your firewood to decay more quickly than it would otherwise. Dirt is the natural environment of many kinds of wood eating bacteria, fungus, and bugs. To prevent decay, you might:


Lay a tarp or a similar covering between wood and the dirt beneath it.
Place 2x4 boards underneath your wood to separate it from the ground.Layer clean gravel between your wood and the dirt., Some communities or regions may have special regulations for firewood storage. You can easily find out this information by inquiring with your local fire department as to whether or not your storage location is in line with local code."
"
Dry firewood completely.,
Check the dryness of your firewood.,
Stack firewood between suitable walls or posts.,
Create bookends with stacked wood.,
Continue to stack wood.,
Avoid piling the wood too high.",How to Store Firewood Outdoors2," Properly dried firewood is easier to light, burns cleaner, and gives off more heat. There are two kinds of wet wood: green wood and seasoned wood that has gotten wet. Avoid covering both kinds with a tarp. The more air exposure wood has, the faster it will dry. Covering wood with a tarp may prolong the time it takes to dry and could cause mold to grow.""Green wood"" means it has been freshly cut and still has green sap in it. This wood can take from several months to a year to dry. For the best and quickest results, cut the wood and store it where it will be protected from wetness.
""Seasoned wood"" means the green sap in the wood has already dried. If this kind of wood has gotten wet again, simply stack it in a place protected from moisture until it dries again.

, For green wood, you should wait a few months before testing the wood, but wood that's already seasoned may dry out in a few days to a week, depending on conditions. Check the dryness of your wood with a firewood moisture meter or by knocking together two pieces of wood. Dry wood knocked together will make a high pitched, cleaner sound; wet wood will produce a dull thud., Cement walls, metal T-posts, stacked cinder blocks, and similar stationary objects can be used to support the ends of your woodpile. This will prevent wood from rolling down the sides and becoming a tripping hazard.


T-posts are relatively inexpensive and can easily be moved around, should you need to relocate your woodpile. Buy these at your local hardware store., You can create a stable barrier on either end of your woodpile with an alternating crosswise pattern of stacked logs. Lay your first row of logs normally with front to back orientation with regard to the woodpile. Do this on a ground covering or 2x4 planks so the logs don't directly touch the ground. Then:


At both ends, lay logs crosswise. These logs should occupy the entire front to back length of the logs on both ends. Generally, this pattern results in three logs oriented front to back, and three logs oriented left to right, though this number may vary.

, The wood between your crosswise alternating stacks at both ends of the woodpile should be oriented front to back. As you add rows of front to back logs added between your bookends, add more rows of crosswise alternating logs at both ends.


Do this until you are out of wood, or until your pile has become 4 ft (1.2 m) in height. At that point, start a new pile., If you are using posts or crosswise stacked bookends to keep your firewood in place, avoid stacking the pile over 4 ft (1.2 m). This will cause the wood to become unstable, and could result in it falling and doing harm or damage.


In some cases, like with a specially designed woodshed, you may be able to pile wood higher than 4 ft (1.2 m) safely. However, for freestanding woodpiles or those that are supported only at the ends, avoid exceeding 4 ft (1.2 m)."
"
Take precautions with moldy wood.,
Protect against insect infestation.,
Avoid burning treated wood to prevent injury and harm.",How to Store Firewood Outdoors3," Because mold can spread to your home, cause allergic reactions, aggravate respiration, and so on, moldy wood should always be stored outdoors. However, with cases of mild to moderate mold, you should be able to burn this without any issues.


The negative health effects of wood mold are increased when smoke from burning moldy wood is inhaled.
If you, a friend, or a family member is sensitive to mold, is allergic to it, or has asthma, you should avoid burning moldy firewood.
A wood burning stove will limit inhalation, but cooking fires, campfires, or open hearth fires may cause aggravated respiration, asthma attacks, and so on., While splitting wood, you may have noticed colonies of insects, either alive, dead, or dormant, inside the wood. This wood burns just fine, but it's best to burn it outdoors. Bringing infested wood in your home could cause the infestation to spread.


You should also separate infested wood from non-infested wood. This way, the insects will not spread to the good wood.

, Many kinds of wood used in construction are treated with chemicals to prolong its life and integrity. When burned, this wood can release a deadly smoke that could cause permanent harm or death.


While treated wood can be used in many different construction projects, the most common areas you'll find treated wood are: decks, railings, trim, and so on.
Generally, treated wood has a greenish tinge to it. However, over time this color may have faded or otherwise changed. When in doubt, throw away potentially treated wood."

Select an athletic ball.,
Cut a “V” into the ball.,
Create a funnel and scoop.,
Select your filling material.,
Fill your medicine ball with the material.,
Weigh your medicine ball.,
Scuff up the area around the flap.,
Adhere the patch to the ball.,
Cover the entire ball with duct or athletic tape.",How to Make a Medicine Ball," When you are creating your own medicine ball, an athletic ball, such as a basketball, will provide the structure for your homemade workout tool. While you may purchase a new athletic ball, you can save money by repurposing an old sports ball. Most homemade medicine balls are made out basketballs, but you may also use a soccer ball or a rubber ball.


If you don’t have an old athletic ball at home, ask a neighbor or friend if they have one you may use. You may also shop at thrift stores.;
, In order to fill the ball with materials, you must create a hole, or flap, in the athletic ball. With a permanent marker, draw a “V” on the ball—the “V” should be approximately one inch long x one inch wide. Use a sharp utility knife to cut along the lines of the “V.” Do not cut across the top of the “V”—this is where the flap should remain attached to the athletic ball.Do not draw and cut your “V” near the air nozzle. The nozzle may prevent the funnel from fitting in the flap., A funnel and scoop will speed up the process of filling the medicine ball and prevent you from making a mess. To create your own funnel and scoop, find an empty plastic beverage bottle. Use your sharp utility knife to cut the bottle in half around its body. The top half will function as the funnel; the bottom half will serve as the scoop.Disregard this step if you have your own funnel and scooping device.

, You may add weight to your medicine ball with a variety of materials. The materials you use are entirely up to you. The most common filler is sand. Filling your medicine ball with sand will produce a heavy exercise tool. For a lighter workout ball, you may fill your medicine ball with a variety of recycled materials, such as styrofoam and cut up mattress toppers, or common household dry goods, like rice or salt.


If you use sand, purchase it from a store—do not use sand from outdoors. Sand from outside will contain moisture and vegetation that could produce unwanted molds inside your medicine ball., Lift the “V” flap and insert the nozzle of your funnel into the hole. With your makeshift scoop, transfer the materials from the container to the funnel. Continue adding material to the medicine ball until it is full.


You may need to shake the medicine ball occasionally to make room for more materials.
While the medicine ball should fill up quickly, you will end up using more filling material than you anticipated., Prior to sealing your medicine ball, weigh the piece of exercise equipment. Place the medicine ball on a scale and evaluate its weight.


If the medicine ball is heavier than you would like, remove filling material until it reaches the weight you desire.
If the medicine ball is lighter than you would like, add more filler to the ball. If there is no more space for material, you may need to refill the medicine ball with a heavier material., Before you can use your medicine ball, you must seal the flap you created. While you can use a variety of tape and glues to keep the material inside the ball, it is highly recommended that you seal the flap with a rubber patch repair kit. These kits typically include scuff tool. Use this tool to roughen up the area around the hole. Roughening up the surface will help the adhesive attach to the ball.


You can purchase a rubber patch repair kit online or find one in the “Camping” aisle of your local department store.
You can use a rubber patch repair kit for tents or tires., Use a pair of scissors to round the edges of the patch—this will prevent the patch from peeling. Follow the kit’s instructions about adhesive application and patch placement. Once the patch is in place, allow the adhesive to cure.


Do not use the medicine ball before the glue is dry., While the patch will adequately seal the flap, you may want to seal the entire ball with a protective layer. You may use duct tape or athletic tape to create this seal. When the adhesive is dry, apply strips of tape to the surface of the medicine ball. Once sealed, you may start exercising with your homemade medicine ball.


The weight and shape of your medicine ball should be balanced and even. Do your best to keep the layers of tape even."

Listen to your body.",How to Make Your Workout More Intense," Strength training is great for building muscle and bone. It also helps ward off age-related diseases such as osteoporosis.Incorporating a full-body strength training regimen can make your workout more intense because it targets major and small muscles at the same time.Talk with your doctor or a certified trainer before beginning or changing a strength-training program. They can help you create the best plan for your abilities and needs.
Incorporate full body moves such as squats to overhead presses, lunges with bicep curls, or mountain climbers with pushups.Use resistance bands if weights are too heavy. These offer a similar muscle building effect and intensity.Take a 90-120 second break in between sets. This can maintain your intensity and keep your momentum going.;
, Increasing the weight and reps you perform is the easiest way to increase the intensity of your strength training routine. However, you need to do this gradually to prevent injury from over-training your body.Make sure you are doing 3-4 sets of each exercise.
Increase the weight or reps only when you can easily perform every rep in each set. A good rule of thumb is to increase both no more than 10% each week. For example, if you are squatting and pressing 100 pounds for 3 sets of 6 reps each, go up to 110 pounds only when you are comfortable with the 3 sets at 100 pounds.
Make sure you are lifting in a controlled manner before you increase the weight. For example, lift as you inhale, hold for a second, and then release as you exhale.

, Yoga and Pilates are two other workouts that can intensify your strength training. Although they’re lower impact than many activities, Pilates and vigorous forms of yoga such as ashtanga, jivamukti, or vinyasa can also build muscle while providing short bursts of intense cardio. Try a yoga or Pilates class either in a studio or online.Choose from local classes or online yoga and Pilates courses. These will give you a chance to try out different types of intense yoga and figure out what suits your needs best. Look for classes taught by instructors certified in the yoga style that they are teaching.

, Interval training is alternating intense bursts of activity with lighter ones.Incorporating a few high intensity intervals to your workouts every week can make them more intense. You can dedicate one workout every week to doing high intensity intervals or add some intervals at the end of your runs 2-3 days a week.In addition, intervals can help you get faster over time.


Schedule 1-2 really intense workouts every week. Build in less intense workouts around those days. For example, you could do an intense workout on a Thursday and do the next on Saturday or Sunday.
Add 5-10 minutes of intervals during or at the end of your workouts 2 or 3 days a week. For example, run or jog at your “race pace” for 60 seconds and then increase your intensity for 30 seconds.

, Incorporating hills or inclines to your workouts automatically increases your workout intensity without changing pace. Either increases your strength and endurance. Tack on hills or inclines to one or two workouts per week for more intensity.Do hill intervals or add inclines at the end of one or two workouts each week. For example, set the treadmill at a 3% incline if you’re at the gym or live someplace flat.

, Like hills and inclines, walking or running stairs automatically increases your intensity. In fact, stairs are one of the best overall conditioning exercises. Choose to either run physical stairs—such as at a stadium—or use a stair machine at your gym.Add this to any running workout or replace one run a week with a stair run.


Run or walk up the stairs at a fast pace. Follow this by going back down them slowly to recover before your next flight up. If you’re using a stair machine, walk or run on them for a minute at a hard pace for a minute followed by an easy minute.

, Some people find working out on machines, the road, or trails boring. Adding some obstacles can make your workout more fun and intense. It can maintain your intensity and build smaller muscles.Use nature’s obstacles to your benefit. Trails are one great option because you can jump over logs and streams and swivel around rock formations.
Inquire if there are any public obstacle courses in your area. Some features that can challenge your intensity include: a cargo net to climb, a rope climb up a nearly vertical wall, leaping through tires, running through a concrete tunnel, and a mud pit through which you have to crawl.

, If you’re new to working out or a seasoned pro, it’s good to have a weekly workout plan. Formulating a plan can ensure you get a balance of higher intensity exercise with needed recovery workouts and rest. This is also a safe way to gradually increase your intensity while minimizing the risk of injury. Getting in a workout or another intense physical activity 5-6 days a week can help build up the intensity of your workouts.Work out most days of the week. Aim for least 150 minutes of moderate activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity over the course of the week. If you are already working out for the recommended time each week, gradually increase the time you exercise. Ten minutes every week allows you to work out more intensively while minimizing the risk of injury.
Break up your workouts up into manageable sections if you’re just starting. For example, 2-15 minute intense workouts may be more effective than one moderate workout.

, Consider activities such as speed walking, running, swimming, rowing or biking. You can also use machines such as an elliptical or stair trainer. Try mixing different types of workouts throughout the week. For example, you could run two days, swim one, use a rowing machine another, and play a pick-up game of beach volleyball on the weekend.


Keep in mind other types of activities that count as a workout include team sports, running or playing outside with your kids, jumping rope or on a trampoline.

, Cardio burn classes, boot camp classes as well as barre and yoga that incorporate free weights and other equipment are another great way to up your intensity. These types of group classes often offer intervals of intensity with periods of lighter recovery. They can also motivate you to get to the gym.Sign up for a class in between other workouts to give your body a nice change up to a routine. Recognize that these classes often have the advantage of teaching you proper form, which you can apply as you make your workouts more intense.

, You may want to dive right into your more intense workouts. However, this is a recipe for injury and may make it more difficult to sustain your more intense effort. Gradually easing into the workout by warming up may prevent injury and allow you to work out with greater intensity.Walk at a moderate pace for 3-5 minutes. This loosens your muscles, tendons and joints and gets them ready to workout. Afterward, begin your chosen workout at an easy pace for another 3-5 minutes before beginning your more intense phase.

, You can figure it out by doing your chosen workout for a specific distance or time and see how you feel. This is your “race pace.” Gradually add more time to your workouts at this pace to increase your intensity.Consider your specific workouts and what your goal is. For example, if you want to run 10-minute miles, you first need to figure out where your time is. Run a mile as hard as you can and look at the time. That’s your “race pace.” You’ll need to incorporate faster intervals of running to get your time to your goal. Another example is if you swim. Swim 100m and clock when you finish. Use this as your baseline time to gradually improve by adding sprints.

, A big part of increasing the intensity of your workout is staying in the game mentally. Breaking intense workouts into manageable sections or playing games with your mind can help you get through especially intense parts of your workouts.For example, say, “Just make it to the next block. If you feel miserable, walk for a minute. If you’re in good shape, sprint to the block after that.”

, Staying hydrated is an important part to any workout. This is especially true if you want to make your workouts more intense. Making sure you’re hydrated before, during, and after a workout can help you maintain your intensity for longer.Drink 8-16 ounces of water one or two hours before your workout. If you’re working out for an hour or less, drink 3-6 ounces every 15 to 20 minutes. Have 3-6 ounces every 15 to 20 minutes if you are working out between 1 and 4 hours.
Remember that drinking water is usually enough to stay hydrated. If you like, you can also mix water and a sports drink to replenish any sodium or electrolytes lost during your workout. This combination is especially helpful if you’re working out longer than one hour. Use a sports drink that isn’t loaded with sugar, as it can upset your stomach.
Drink 8-24 ounces after your workout to replace fluids.

, After a more intense workout, it’s important to do a good cool down. This can shift your blood flow to resting patterns, prevent dizziness, and help your muscles recover. In turn, it will allow you to continue doing more intense workouts.Taper off your workout as it nears the end. Try and get about 5-10 minutes at this slower pace. After this, do a gentle and brisk 3-5 minute walk.
Aid recovery with a cold water bath, foam rolling, or stretching to help your body further recover. These are especially helpful as you gradually increase your intensity.

, Finish your planned workouts or as many as you are able each week. The frequency can help you gradually add more intensity. But if you’re sick or feeling tired, do a shorter and/ or less intense workout. Consider giving yourself a rest day. You can always pick up your workouts when you feel better.Be aware that not taking cues from your body can lead to injuries, especially if you have pain. Allowing for rest can be the difference between sticking with more intense workouts or needing to see a doctor.
Cross-train on days you’re feeling fatigued or ill. Swimming, biking, rowing, or using the elliptical can keep your endurance level at its peak.

Use a tarp to protect your firewood from moisture.,
Stack firewood effectively.,
Do not put a tarp over firewood before it's dry.,
Makes sure your firewood is ready before using it.,
Check any local regulations regarding firewood storage.",How to Store Firewood," When storing firewood, it's important to keep convenience in mind. Firewood can be heavy to carry from outside into your home, and this can be especially stressful during the colder months. Seek out an appropriate space as close to your home as possible.Keep in mind, if there aren't any appropriate spaces very close to your home, you can invest in a wheelbarrow to make transferring the firewood easier.;
, When firewood is stored directly on the ground, it will rot quicker. Bacteria and bugs can get into the firewood, causing it to go bad. Look for a place off of soil.Surfaces like concrete, asphalt, and clean gravel can be good surfaces for firewood.
If you can't find any appropriate surfaces, you can use sticks to elevate firewood off of the ground. You can also lay down a tarp underneath firewood.

, If you have an outdoor storage shed, this a great place to store firewood. Inside a shed, firewood will be protected from things like rain. The shed will also provide a barrier between firewood and the soil. If possible, store firewood in an outdoor shed.You can also store firewood in your garage.

, Some people store firewood in their home. If you have the room, it can be very convenient to store firewood in your home. Firewood will last longer away from moisture and soil.You can store firewood in an old trunk, if you have one.
Some fireplaces have compartments built into the wall next to them where you can store firewood.
Make sure firewood you store indoors is fully dry. If you chopped or collected your own firewood, you should store it outside until it dries. It takes firewood around six months to fully dry out., If you can't find an area outdoors off of the soil, you can easily elevate firewood using 2 by 4 boards. You can buy boards at any hardware store and create a quick storage area for your firewood.Lay the boards on the ground about 15 inches apart. Lay down as many rows of boards as you need to stack all your firewood.
Lay your firewood over the boards, keeping them parallel to the boards. The boards should elevate the firewood off the ground slightly, preventing it from touching the soil.

, You should always lay a tarp down over your firewood. You can buy a tarp at any hardware store. Simply lay the tarp over the firewood and tie it down to secure it. You can also weigh the tarp down with something like bricks.It's important to allow for some air circulation, as you don't want your firewood to get too dry. You should leave the sides of your stack open to allow for airflow., When stacking firewood, make sure to do so effectively. Stacking your firewood incorrectly can cause it to rot quicker.You should always stack your firewood rather than throwing it in a pile. This will promote air circulation and keep firewood from drying out.
Never stack firewood against a wall when stacking it outdoors. This can leave firewood vulnerable to moisture and bacteria. Always leave a few inches of space between your firewood and a wall.
It's okay to stack firewood against a wall if you're stacking it indoors.

, Wet firewood needs to dry out before it can be stored safely. Wet wood needs to be exposed to open air to dry out. If you've just collected firewood, refrain from putting a tarp over it.If it's going to rain, it's appropriate to cover wet firewood with a tarp. Just make sure to leave the sides of firewood pile uncovered.

, You do not want to throw wet firewood into your fireplace. Before using your firewood, make sure it's adequately dry.Dry firewood will be gray with cracks along the edges.
Dry firewood will also be much lighter than wet firewood.

, It's possible your city or neighborhood may have regulations about storing firewood. Look over local codes in your area before choosing a storage method for your firewood. You want to make sure you store your firewood legally."

Check the thermostat settings.,
Investigate doors, covers, and registers.,
Verify the condition of fuses or circuit breakers.",How to Start a Gas Furnace," Basic furnace operation and pilot lighting instructions are generally listed on a sticker attached to the front access panel. Improper usage or maintenance of your furnace could result in the furnace not functioning, fires, explosions, property damage, personal injury, or death.Some furnaces may no longer have attached instructions or these may be difficult to read due to label dirtiness or deterioration. Your furnace user manual should include a copy of all instructions.
If you’ve misplaced your manual, look it up online with a keyword search for the furnace make and model number.
Because there are many different furnace designs, a diagram can be useful when locating various parts. Furnace diagrams are generally found in the user manual.;
, Smell the area around your furnace, including low to the floor. Some gas may be heavier than air and sink to the floor, escaping immediate notice. There should be no leaks or water on or around the furnace. Water can cause dangerous shorts in your furnace electrical components.

If you detect gas, do not turn on any appliances, light switches, or phones. Evacuate the building completely and contact your gas company from outside or next door for further instruction.
If there are leaks, turn off electricity to your furnace. Repair leaking pipes and dry the area completely before returning power to the furnace.
If any furnace electrical components were submerged in water, do not turn the furnace on. Call a furnace technician to inspect your furnace and replace ruined parts., If your furnace has been off for the warm months, you may need to restore power to the furnace at your home electrical panel or fuse box. These are usually found in your basement, utility room, or garage. The furnace fuse or breaker should be in the “On” position., The front access panel is often held in place with screws. Unfasten these, if necessary, with a screwdriver or suitable tool. Set the panel off to the side. Keep the screws in a location they won’t be lost, like in a plastic baggie.Taking off the access panel should give you an improved view of the pilot light. Additionally, some controls, like the gas supply, may be located behind this panel.

, A description of the ideal flame for your pilot should included in your manual. Generally, the flame should not be excessively yellow, it should not be split into two or more flames, and it should not flicker or waver., Most pilot lights can be adjusted by turning a screw on the body of the pilot valve. Reach into the access panel and insert a suitable screwdriver into the slot of the pilot screw. Turn it counterclockwise to intensify the flame and clockwise to diminish it.

Verify the pilot adjustment screw in the furnace manual before adjusting it. Turning the incorrect screw could dangerously impact the performance of your pilot.
Depending on your furnace, the ideal pilot light may differ slightly. Most home models will have a full and steady flame that is between 1½ and 2 in (3.8 and 5 cm) tall.After adjusting your pilot light, if its condition remains questionable, you be able to resolve the problem by turning off power and gas to the furnace and relighting the pilot.

, Turn the power switch of the furnace to “Off.” The gas supply can usually be found along the furnace bottom, on its control panel, or inside the access panel. Turn the gas supply to “Off” and wait at least five minutes.

Failing to wait at least five minutes could result in the gas not fully dissipating, which can cause fires when relighting the pilot.
While waiting for gas to dissipate, locate the “Reset” button for your furnace. This is usually found near the gas supply controls., Hold a long stem lighter in your hand. With your free hand, set your gas supply to “Pilot.” Light the lighter. Press in and hold the “Reset” button. Bring the flame of the lighter to the opening of the pilot light. When lit, remove the lighter and release the “Reset” button. Turn the gas supply to “On.”

Substitute long stem lighter for a long stem match. In a pinch, roll paper into a thin tube and light one end on fire. Use this as you would a match.
In some cases, you may need to repeat the pilot lighting procedure more than once. The flame should be thick and steady, with a height of roughly 1½ to 2 in (3.8 to 5 cm).If your pilot does not stay lit after 3 tries or does not burn as intended, turn off power and gas to the furnace and consult a furnace technician., If your furnace instructions indicate it has an auto igniter, do not attempt to light the pilot by hand. Different models of auto ignition furnace may have different procedures for lighting. For this reason, follow the manual instructions to use this feature.

Generally, furnaces with auto igniters must be turned off and purged of gas as usual. Access panels are then replaced and power restored to the furnace before a special thermostat setting or button, like one labeled ""Call for Heat,"" is used to start the pilot., Fit the panel back in place on the furnace. Use your screwdriver or a suitable tool to refasten the panel in place. Access panels and door covers that aren’t properly reattached may prevent your furnace from starting., The “On” switch for most furnaces is usually placed at eye level or a little higher. This switch is frequently installed around the bottom of basement stairs, but it may also be found the furnace room. Set this switch to the “On” position., The thermostat of your furnace should now have power. Select the “Heat” setting on the thermostat, then set the temperature to your preference. When the temperature drops below the thermostat setting, the furnace will turn on and heat your home.If you have a furnace with an auto ignition feature, usually this is the point you would trigger the igniter with a special thermostat setting or button, sometimes labeled ""Call for Heat."" Once lit, set your furnace to ""Heat."", Dirty filters are a common problem that often prevent your furnace from starting.Buy a new filter at your local hardware store. Turn off the furnace and remove the filter service panel. Pull out the used filter from its slot and replace it with the new filter. Turn on the furnace.

Some furnaces may have a special procedure for replacing filters. Always follow your furnace instructions for the best results.
Most basic filters, like those made of fiberglass or paper, should be changed every month or two. Electrostatic and HEPA filters only need to be changed every two to four months.
If you have pets, you may need to replace your filter more frequently for it to operate most efficiently., Make sure the thermostat is working by adjusting its temperature setting by 5° increments until the furnace turns on. Double check that the “Heat” setting is selected on the thermostat.If your thermostat is not working, consult your manual for troubleshooting or replacement options.

, Many furnaces will not start if access doors or covers are not correctly reattached. Too many closed heat registers can also create problems. At most, only 20% of your registers should be closed.

In a home with 10 heat registers, for example, you should only close 2 registers at most. Closing registers in unused rooms can cut down heating costs., If your furnace does not turn on even when power is supplied to it from the electrical panel or fuse box, you may have a blown fuse. Check the main electrical panel or fuse box of your home and any furnace fuses. Reset or replace blown fuses.

The layout of your furnace will vary depending on your make and model. To quickly locate fuses for your furnace, consult the manual instructions.
Furnace fuses are often found behind an electrical panel close to the main access panel. These fuses may also be positioned inside or on top of the unit.
Blown furnace fuses are a somewhat rare occurrence. Replacement furnace fuses can be purchased at your local hardware store."

Keep a list of customers.",How to Sell Firewood," You'll need supplies that will allow you to cut and transport the firewood.Gasoline-powered chainsaws are the cutting tool of choice, but it can also help to have a buck saw, Swede saw, and a razor-sharp axe. If you need to drive a wedge, use a sledgehammer and maul.
Powered log splitters are very handy to have, as well, since they can save a lot of time and energy.
A small business can use a pickup truck to transport firewood, but if you want to expand the business, you'll need a low-boy trailer.;
, You can't cut down any tree you see. You'll need to get the firewood you sell from a legally acceptable source.


Trees on your own property are typically fine as long as there are no zoning laws prohibiting you from cutting them down.
You can usually harvest marked trees from a national forest.
Thin, dead, and dying trees on private forests, fence rows, and lots are usually okay, too.
Purchase the excess wood usually discarded by sawmills.
Offer to cut up and remove unwanted trees that fall after a storm.

, While not strictly necessary, treating your firewood will usually make it easier to legally ship firewood to a greater customer base. One of the simplest ways to treat firewood is simply to remove the outer layers.


If you take this option, you'll have to remove both the bark and 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of the wood beneath it, called the cambium layer.

, Another simple way to treat firewood for shipment out of the county or out of the state is to use a kiln drying treatment, which dries the wood out and kills off many forms or larvae.The maximum allowable thickness of wood is usually around 3 inches (7.6 cm).
Use steam, hot water, or a kiln to heat the wood to a minimum temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71.1 degrees Celsius). Maintain this temperature for at least 75 minutes.

, Store the prepared firewood in neatly stacked bundles and keep those bundles in a dry location.


Ideally, firewood should be elevated off the ground to prevent moisture from soaking in through the bottom.
If you must store firewood outside, keep a tarp or similar covering over the piles to limit the amount of moisture coming in contact with the wood.

, While each state has its own process, nearly every state will require you to fill out an application permitting you to sell firewood.Obtain the application, fill it out, sign it, and take it to a state forestry office for approval.
After being approved, you will likely be issued a stamp or tickets that can be used to label or bundles. Your name will also be added to a list of state-approved vendors.
You will need a separate application for each county you harvest wood in and for each separate type of firewood.

, Since firewood sources and other details can change on a yearly basis, you will need to reapply as a vendor each year.


Make sure that you renew your application on time. Typically, the deadline will arrive sometime in early to mid fall.

, While some states will allow you to move firewood past state lines when strict conditions are followed, most states strongly discourage it, so it is easier and safer to only sell firewood locally.


Firewood easily transports invasive insects. Selling firewood from your state to someone in another state could introduce that pest the another area, thereby spreading the problem. Moreover, since the insect will not be native to that area, there will not be as many natural predators to help reduce the population., Most states will only allow you to sell firewood in full or partial cords. A cord is a stack of firewood measuring 128 cubic feet (39 cubic meters). Similarly, a half cord is 64 cubic feet (19.5 cubic meters) and a quarter cord is 32 cubic feet (9.8 cubic meters).


The dimensions of the pile do not need to be precise as long as the total volume equals the correct amount. For instance, the stack could be 4 feet (1.2 meters) wide, 4 feet (1.2 meters) high, and 8 feet (2.4 meters) long, but it could also be 2 feet (0.61 meters) wide, 4 feet (1.2 meters) high, and 16 feet (4.9 meters) long.
You are not allowed to sell firewood using terms like ""face cord,"" ""rack,"" ""pile,"" or ""truckload.""

, No matter how much firewood you sell, the moment you decide to become a firewood vendor and apply for permission to do so, you also become a small business. As such, you will need to pay small business taxes.


You will need to pay federal and state self-employment taxes.
If you make below a certain amount, you may not own business tax, but the income will still be taxable. This amount can vary from state to state., People are obviously more interested in buying firewood during the late fall, winter, and early spring. You can sell wood during other times of year, but you'll make the most profit when the weather is cold and the demand rises.


You may also notice that sudden drops in temperature during an already cold season will increase your sales further, especially if the temperatures are supposed to stay low for several days.

, This is the most traditional way to sell firewood, and in some respects, it might prove the most useful. Find the nearest busy road and put up a ""Firewood for Sale"" sign. Include a phone number so that those who pass the sign know who to contact.Another take on this principle is to set up a roadside stand. Park your truck or trailer along the street with a load of firewood and a ""for sale"" sign on it.

, Since most of your firewood sales will come from local sources, placing a small ad in your local newspaper will usually help some. Take out a low-cost ad, state, ""Firewood for sale,"" and include your phone number.

, Word of mouth is usually one of the best marketing resources a small business has. If you make your customers happy, encourage them to spread the word to their friends.


You can also let your own friends, relatives, coworkers, and acquaintances know about your business.
Consider printing up business cards. Include a business card with each delivery and pass them around to potentially interested parties.

, Even if you only intend to sell firewood locally, having a sales presence on the Internet can be a good idea.


Set up a website or blog that allows customers to make purchases online.
Make a page for your firewood business on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, or other social media websites.
Post an ad on Craigslist or another online classifieds website.

, If you're selling the firewood from home, most buyers will call in their orders and ask you to deliver the wood they buy. Since most firewood is purchased during notably cold days, customers will usually want a speedy delivery.


Make sure that you have enough time to make the delivery and provide estimates that will give you plenty of extra time. For instance, if you think you can deliver the firewood the next day, you should still say that delivery could take three or four days. Receiving something early never bothers someone as much as receiving something late does.

, You are legally required by most states to provide each customer with a receipt when a purchase is made and delivered.


This receipt should include information about both the seller and the buyer, including names, addresses, and phone numbers.
The kind and amount of wood purchase should be noted, as well as the price paid.
Also include the date of delivery or date of shipment.

, Keep a list of every customer who has bought firewood from you, including their name, number, and address.


Call these customers up early the following cold season, before temperatures drop too severely, and ask them to consider purchasing from you again this year.
Note, however, that a customer who asks to be removed from your list should be removed.

Find tinder.,
Find a substitute for kindling.,
Use your favorite potato chips as a fire starter.,
Use newspaper.,
Use pine cones.,
Make the fire.,
Enjoy a night under the stars next to the warmth of your new fire.",How to Start a Fire With Different Types of Kindling," Kindling tends to be the material used to let larger wood really catch, while tinder is small shavings or shreds of material that will burn hot quickly and starts the kindling burning. Kindling is larger than tinder. Examples of tinder include dry grass, dry bark and down from birds. Once the tinder is burning, you can slowly add the kindling, unless you've already arranged it in a style such as a lean-to or tip over the tinder (see below for links to building the fire). However, there is a fine line between what can be used as tinder and what can be used as kindling––sometimes certain material can be used for both purposes. Some ideas for tinder (some of which might also be useful as kindling) include:


Use lint. Pack a toilet paper roll with dryer lint. When you're ready for a fire, pile wood around the lint roll. Light the center of the cardboard roll (exterior) and it'll catch fire and burn outwards, catching on the piled wood as it burns. The beauty of this is that it's making use of items around the house and it doesn't weigh much in your pack. Also note that if you have several of these, they can serve as kindling as well as tinder.
Use pine needles. Use pine needles or pinecones to start a fire. Select only dry needles, not green ones, as these won't take as easily. Pile onto the fire in little lots rather than everywhere or it risks smothering the flame.
Save and dry small pieces of tree bark. Bark catches fire quickly and will maintain embers for a long time.
Use dry debris. Use dry debris from your yard, such as twigs, leaves, and moss to start a fire. Ensure that there isn't too much soil in what you've gathered, as it can prevent fire from lighting.;
, Normally you'd look for dry wood, such as tree limbs, tree twigs and branches, or split wood if at an organized campsite. However, this isn't always possible, so the following ideas are presented to help you in a pinch.

, If you have a bag of potato chips handy, they can function as a fire-starter due to the fat content of the chips. Light a chip with a lighter or a match and it will burn for approximately 3 minutes. Add the lit chip to a pile of chips on the campfire you've set up (see below for making a fire). While the chip kindling is burning, place light, dry wood on top to catch alight over the burning chips.

, Roll five dry newspapers into a tight tube, tie the tube into a knot, and light the knot on fire. The tight paper will burn slowly, allowing more time for the wood to catch fire.


Tying the paper into a knot will prevent the layers from moving around when lit.

, Pine cones are quick to catch fire over tinder (such as pine needles). As well as being suitable kindling, they give off a great aroma.

, Once you've assembled the tinder and kindling, you'll need to make a decision as to how to build the fire. There are quite a few ways to build a fire, each having its own utility dependent on where you are, the temperature and weather and the terrain, etc. Here are some articles to follow on to, which will explain how to make a fire successfully:


How to build a campfire

How to start a fire with sticks or How to start a fire with a magnifying glass


How to make a fire to survive.

, Keep the fire well stoked by adding new fuel regularly throughout the time of the fire's use.


If the fire goes out, sometimes you can restart it simply be shifting around the coals and throwing on some more kindling to catch fire to the existing hot logs on the campfire.
Wet wood can be dried out next to a fire; sometimes you'll have no choice.

Cut pieces into triangular lengths.,
Support the woodpile.,
Expose the woodpile to air and, if possible, sunlight.,
Get the woodpile off the ground.,
Keep the woodpile far away from buildings.",How to Stack and Protect Firewood for Winter," Experts recommend splitting wood into triangular pieces since it often stacks better that way. Triangular cuts prevent otherwise round pieces from rolling off a pile and injuring someone. A length of about 1 to 1.5 feet (0.3 to 0.5 m) is recommended.;
, Again, without proper support, pieces can fall off the woodpile and injure those who are accessing it. Use sound, heavy items to support each end of a woodpile.


Some who prefer a natural approach like to use trees to support the ends of a woodpile. In some cases, this might be fine, but watch out for the risks of changing or stunting a tree's growth over time.
Some helpful steel frame designs are on the market for helping to store cord wood safely and securely.

, Some people might not want to leave a woodpile exposed to the elements, but on the other hand, sunlight helps to cure wood, making it drier for eventual use. A good common ground is to cover the woodpile but expose it to sunlight from the sides.

, Those who build wood storage racks higher than ground level can have much better results. That's because wood that is in contact with the ground can suffer from fungal growth, mold or rotting. That's not to mention the variety of animals who might seek to make their homes there.

, One additional safety risk with any woodpile is the risk of fire. When wood piles are too close to a building, they can escalate a blaze if they catch fire. It's best to keep the woodpile about 20 feet (6.1 m) away from homes and buildings.

Know what hand weights are good for.,
Purchase a set of hand weights if possible.,
Decide what kind of style you want.,
Determine the number of reps you are comfortable with.",How to Workout at Home Using Hand Weights1," Keep in mind that hand weights are also called dumbbells or free weights. Exercises that use hand weights are good for building up strength, increasing your endurance, and building muscle mass.;
, It is good to buy varying dumbbell weights because you can then progressively challenge yourself as you progress with your weight training. The standard combination of weight to buy is two 5 pound weights, two 10 pound weights, and two 15 pound weights. To test whether or not a set is good for you, pick up the smallest weight in the group. Lift and lower this hand weight 10 times. If you are exhausted and don’t think you could do more than 10, that weight set is too heavy.Similarly, If you have spent a lot of time working out and think that these weights won’t challenge you, purchase heavier weights. Employees at your local sport goods store should be able to help you determine which set of weights will work best for you.

, Some hand weights have contours that guide you as to where to put your fingers. Others are smooth. They come in a variety of colors and materials, including metal, plastic, and rubber. Determine which kind you want based on your personal preference.


Keep in mind that a hand weight that has a grip that is too wide will cause more fatigue than normal.

, Reps are the number of times you do a certain exercise. Listed below are different exercises you can do with hand weights. The number of reps, however, is up to you and your comfort level. Generally a person just beginning to use dumbbells will begin with 10-12 reps on each exercise and then work his/her way up from there.

Know what size stretch wrap you need.,
Know what gauge stretch wrap you should use.,
Know the best tools to use, to wrap the firewood.",How to Select the Right Stretch Wrap for Firewood Bundling," Bundling Film: This is narrow width stretch wrap that comes in widths of 2"", 3"" and 5"".

Bundling film is a good choice when you want to keep your firewood vented. It allows you to wrap just the ends, or both ends and the middle, and reduce the possibility of moisture becoming trapped in the wrap.
Hand Stretch Film is is a wider wrap that comes in stock widths of 12"", 15"" and 18"". With the extra width, this can allow for a quicker wrap time and will fit many firewood bundling machines and devices. All of hand wrap films comes on a standard 3"" core.;
, Ultimately, this is a very subjective question, but there are some guidelines that can be used.

The typical application for stretch film is holding together boxes of product on a skid weighing typically over 1000lbs, so the wrap has to be able to stretch tightly to hold the load together during the shipping and handling processes. That is not the case with firewood bundling, where the bundles are small, typically moved by hand, and weigh only a few dozen pounds at most.

For these reasons, Extreme 789 hand wrap is recommended. This hand wrap is thinner and less expensive than a traditional 80-90ga film, but has comparable strength when it comes to holding your bundles together. It has the cling you expect with a standard gauge stretch wrap and will resist the minimal puncture potential presented by firewood.



,

Handy Bundler is the most common type. The film comes on a 3"" core and each case has one plastic plug-in handle. This is a good choice if you have one person doing the wrapping, and they do it sporadically.
Best Bundler/Extended Core is a film that comes on a 1"" extended core and is available only in 5"" widths. The 5"" of film is wound on a 10"" long core, leaving a 5"" long handle built-in to each roll.

The Best Bundler also ships with one red rubber grip per case, which you can use to slip over the core and reduce any wear on unprotected hands. This is a good choice if you have multiple people doing the wrapping and the wrapping is done fairly often throughout the day.


Use QuikWrap. This is for heavy use, applications, where more than one person is doing the wrapping and they are doing it for the majority of the day, so the patented QuikWrap system is the perfect choice. It's available in all widths (2"", 3"" and 5"") and comes on a 1-3/4"" core.

Bench press with hand weights.,
Do the Lying Fly exercise.,
Do the straight-arm pullover.",How to Workout at Home Using Hand Weights2," You will need a bed or workout bench for this exercise. You could also lie on the floor or on an exercise ball for extra spinal support. Lie back on the bed or bench so that your knees touch the edge of the platform and your feet are firmly planted on the ground.









Hold a dumbbell in each hand. The dumbbells should be lie along your body at chest level. Your palms should be facing towards your feet.

Remove or raise clothing.,
Find your waist.,
Take your measurement.,
Read the tape.,
Double-check your measurement.",How to Measure Your Waist," Remove your shirt or lift it to just below your chest. To get an accurate measurement, you need to ensure that the tape measure is resting against your bare stomach, so you should remove any layers of clothing blocking your waist.;
, Use your fingers to find the top of your hips and the base of your rib cage. Your waist is the soft, fleshy section between these two bony parts. It will also be the narrowest part of your torso.

, Stand up straight and exhale slowly. Hold the end of the tape measure at your navel and circle it around your back to the front. The measuring tape should be parallel to the floor and fit snugly around your torso without digging into your skin., Look at the place on the tape where the zero end meets the other end of the tape measure. The location of this meeting point is your waist measurement., Repeat the measurement once more to ensure the accuracy of your original measurement. If it is different from the first time, measure for a third time and take the average of the three numbers.

Know the dimensions and volume of a full cord.,
Compare the full cord to the face cord.,
Familiarize yourself with the thrown cord.,
Learn about green cords.,
Watch out for measurements that cannot be compared to full cords.,
Look before you buy.,
Verify the length and height of the pile.,
Measure the depth of firewood pile.,
Calculate the full cord value.,
Shop around.,
Compare the value offered by each seller.,
Be aware of outside factors that can affect cost.",How to Measure a Cord of Wood," A full cord, also referred to as a ""cord,"" is a stack of wood that measures 4 feet (1.2 m) wide, 4 feet (1.2 m) tall, and 8 feet (2.4 m) long. Its total volume should be 128 cubic feet (3.5 cubic meters).Note that the exact amount of solid wood in a cord will vary based on the size of each piece, but most cords of firewood average 85 cubic feet (2.4 cubic meters) of solid wood. The remaining volume is taken up by air.
The entire length of the pile should be 8 feet (2.4 m), but the length of each piece of wood matches the width or depth of the pile and should average about 4 feet (1.2 m).
Even though the cord is the standard unit of measurement when selling wood, most firewood dealers do not sell 4-ft (1.2-m) long pieces of wood to home consumers. As a result, other cord-based terminology is often introduced.;
, A face cord is the next most common unit of measurement. It refers to any stack of wood that is 4 feet (1.2 m) high and 8 feet (2.4 m) long. The depth or width of the pile is less than 4 feet (1.2 m), which means that each piece of wood in the pile is less than 4 feet (1.2 m) long.


There is no single agreed upon length for pieces of wood in a face cord. On average, the length of most firewood is 16 inches (40.6 cm), so the depth of most face piles is 16 inches (40.6 cm). This is one-third the depth of a full cord.
Other piece lengths can also be used, however, so you'll need to make sure that you find out how long the average piece in a face cord is before you make the purchase.
While ""face cord"" is the most common terminology used to describe piles like this, ""stove cord,” ""furnace cord,"" “run,” and “rick” are also used and refer to the same thing.

, A thrown cord or loose thrown cord is a rough measurement of volume on wood that has been tossed or dumped into a truck, rather than stacked into neat, compact piles.


A loose thrown cord should take up about 180 cubic feet (6.66 cubic yards or 5.1 cubic meters) of space as is. The idea is that, when stacked, the total volume would equal roughly 128 cubic feet (3.5 cubic meters), or the volume of a full cord. A ""thrown"" cord takes approximately 30%+- more space than a stacked cord. A typical pickup truck w/ 6ft. bed is 54 cubic feet (2 cubic yards - level load-Stacked); an 8ft. bed is 81 cubic feet (3 cubic yards - heaped load- Stacked). Remembering now! that ""thrown"" takes 30%+- more (space) than stacked. Therefore a 6ft. truckload has 30%+- of a ""thrown"" cord; an 8ft. truckload has 45%+- of a ""thrown"" cord. This usually applies to wood pieces between 12 and 16 inches (30.5 and 40.6 cm) long.
When wood pieces are sold in lengths of 2 feet (60.1 cm), total thrown cord volume should be about 195 cubic feet (5.5 cubic meters).

, A green cord refers to a measurement that was taken before wood was split and dried. As such, the current or dried volume can be smaller than the indicated volume by 8 cubic feet (0.23 cubic meters).The green cord volume should be 180 cubic feet (5.1 cubic meters) if loosely stacked or 128 cubic feet (3.5 cubic meters) if neatly stacked, just as you would expect of a loose cord or full cord, respectively.
When green, unseasoned wood is dried, the wood shrinks by about 6 to 8 percent. Firewood dealers sometimes measure and price their merchandise by the green cord instead of full cords or loose cords as a way to make up for the money they would otherwise lose from the shrinkage of wood.

, Sometimes, a dealer might try to sell wood by rough measurements like truckloads, piles, station wagon loads, or pick-up truck loads.


Measurements like these are not regulated and can be difficult to compare, so you might end up getting far less wood than what you paid for if you trust them.
Some states within the United States even ban the sale of firewood by measurements not based on the full cord.

, If possible, avoid buying wood by telephone or online. Visit the supplier yard yourself and take your own measurements.


Measuring from the stacks of wood you plan on purchasing is the safest way to know exactly what you are getting.
If you cannot measure the wood yourself or see the wood before you buy it, at least go through a known dealer with a positive reputation. After you receive the wood, take your own measurements to make sure that you were not cheated.

, Take a tape measure or yardstick and measure the height and length of the entire pile.


For both full cords and face cords, the length should be 8 feet (2.4 m) and the height should be 4 feet (1.2 m).
The exact length and height can vary when you purchase a thrown cord, but you should still measure these dimensions and check them against the dimensions listed by the dealer.

, Take your tape measure or yardstick and measure the depth of the pile, or the average length of each piece of firewood in that pile.


Measure the average log length, not the length of the longest piece or the shortest piece.
For full cords, the length must be 4 feet (1.2 m). For thrown cords, the length must bring the overall volume of the stack to 180 cubic feet (5.1 cubic meters) when multiplied by the measured height and length of the pile.
If you are purchasing a face cord, keep this measurement on hand so that you can use it to calculate the full cord value.

, If you are buying a face cord, divide the depth of a full cord by the piece length of the wood in your face cord. Multiply this quotient by the price of your face cord to determine the cost of the full cord.


Remember that the depth of a full cord is 4 feet (1.2 m) or 48 inches (1.2 m or 122 cm).
For instance, if Bob is selling a face cord with an average piece length of 16 inches (40.6 cm) for $90, the calculation would look something like this:

48 inches (122 cm) / 16 inches (40.6 cm) = 3
3 * $90 = $270
The full cord value would be $270.



, If you know the average market rate of a full cord in your area, you can compare the full cord value of the face cord you measured to that. If you do not know the average cost, however, you might need to shop around some and figure out your own average.


It might save time to call each dealer and ask for their face cord price and piece length measurement, rather than going to each one and taking your own measurements.
You should still measure the average piece length of the face cord you plan to buy once you've made your decision, though, just to make sure that the dealer's measurements match your own.

, If the piece length offered by each dealer is the same, you can compare face cord costs. If the piece lengths vary, however, you need to calculate the full cord value of each and compare those values to one another.


In the previous example, Bob sold firewood at a full cord value of $270.
If Sally sold 12-inch (30.5-cm) long pieces of firewood at $70, the full cord value would be:

48 inches (122 cm) / 12 inches (30.5 cm) = 4
4 * $70 = $280.


If Sam sells 8-inch (20-cm) long pieces of wood at $60, the full cord value would be:

48 inches (122 cm) / 8 inches (20 cm) = 6
6 * 60 = $360


Even though Bob has the highest face cord price, he has the lowest full cord value at $270. Sally's full cord value is close at $280, but Sam's full cord value is by far the most expensive at $360, even though Sam's face cord cost was cheapest ($60). As such, the best value for your money would be Bob's face cord.

, Even though full cord value is the best way to get the best deal, there are other factors to consider that usually increase the value and cost of wood.


Shorter lengths usually cost more because of the cost of cutting and handling.
Firewood cut into consistent lengths may cost more because more work went into maintaining that even length. Finely split pieces usually cost more because of the extra labor, as well.
Dry wood can cost more because it has been stored under better conditions.
Cleaner firewood is also more valuable because it is more pleasant to the consumer when it comes time to burn it.

Design your workout.,
Come up with a weekly plan.",How to Work out with the Crossfit Program," Flexibility is very important to those doing a cross fit workout. Before you begin the routine, focusing on the hip flexors, lower back, and hamstrings. Some good poses to try include:



Warrior pose.

Forward bend.

Head to knee.

Standing splits.

Side stretch.;
, For an effective cross-fit workout, choose two exercises that truly challenge you. Generally, a basic barbell move, like a squat or bench press, paired with an Olympic weightlifting move, such as the dead-lift or snatch, is a good way to go. Be sure to choose weights and exercises that really challenge you. 10 to 15 reps of each exercise should be enough. Some options to try are:



Squats.

Bench presses.

Overhead presses.

Deadlifts.

Snatches.

Clean and push presses.

, These can use body weight, resistance bands, or medicine balls. Depending on the length of difficulty of the exercises, you can choose to do between two and four different ones. Ideally, each exercise will employ a variety of muscle groups rather than focusing on one section of your body. Do as many reps as you comfortably can, but note that if you can comfortably do more than 50 you should increase the difficulty of the exercise. Here are some ideas for exercises to do:



Pull-ups.

Push ups and push up variants.

Jump Squats.

Medicine ball lunges.

Medicine ball figure eights.

Medicine ball sit ups.

Resistance band squats.

Bicep curls with a resistance band.

Resistance band back rows.

Depth jumps.

Thrusters.

, Once you have chosen the different exercises you want to do, plan how you will do them. There's no real right way to do this, but there are a few guidelines that are good to follow. Consider staggering less challenging exercises between the more challenging ones. An example of a workout plan would be: 10 reps of a heavy exercise followed by 15 reps of a less challenging one. Repeat for 5 rounds. You can also get creative with the routine, such as starting with a large number of reps and decreasing the amount you do each set.

, You should plan on training 4 to 5 days a week. Which days you choose are up to you, with some guidelines. don't train less than 2 days in a row or more than 3 days in a row. Some examples would be to work out Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and rest Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday, work out Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday and rest Sunday and Thursday. or work out for 3 days in a row and then take a rest day.


Know that working out more than 3 days in a row will cause your intensity to go down. It's more beneficial to give 100% 4 to 5 days a week than to give 50% every day.
Don't push yourself harder than you need to. If you're just starting out, it's okay to just workout every other day. Continue this routine for 2 to 10 weeks until you can workout 2 days in a row for every 1 day of rest without feeling overly sore or fatigued. "

Avoid exercises that force your knees to flex.,
Avoid exercises that involve any amount of jumping.",How to Work out With a Bad Knee1," When you flex your knees, you put undue pressure on the bones in that joint as well as the kneecap itself. This undue pressure may cause the kneecap and the joints to grind up against each other, or it may cause discomfort in your knee ligaments and tendons. Some example exercises that put pressure on your knees are full squats and leg presses.


Avoid exercises that involve sudden or awkward movements for your knees. Any activity that involves a lot of agility, e.g., basketball or tennis, will put uneven stresses on your knee joints. Quick and sudden movements are dangerous for weak or uncomfortable knees as they tend to aggravate the problem.;
, When you jump, both of your knees must withstand a force equal to about 2 to 3 times your body weight. When your knees need to deal with that much weight, the chance of injury is greatly increased. Light jumping or hopping should be fine, but be sure to avoid any activity that involves jumping with deep bends at the knees.

Walk.,
Jog.,
Swim.,
Ride a bicycle.,
Perform exercises that do not involve movement of the knees.",How to Work out With a Bad Knee2," It's true that walking involves movement in the knees, but it is a safe exercise for those with knee problems. Walking is a low-impact activity, which means your knees won't experience as much stress as they would if you were, for example, running. If you have access to a gym, consider running on an elliptical machine because it allows you to go through the motions of running without the hard impact of hitting the ground with your feet.

, Many people believe that jogging will inevitably lead to arthritis, but that isn't completely true. If you have a history of injury to your knees, then jogging should likely be avoided because knee injuries are a risk factor towards long-term knee arthritis. However, if your knees haven't experienced many injuries, then light or medium jogging can be great.

, Because of the buoyancy of water, swimming is a great way to involve your whole body in exercise while taking the stress of body weight off of your knees. Swimming hard and fast is an excellent way to maintain cardiovascular health. Just be sure to avoid movements that involve your knees, such as the breaststroke.

, Like running an elliptical machine, bicycle riding is a low-impact activity that takes some undue stress off of the knees. However, when riding a bicycle, do not ride up steep hills and do not set the incline to be too high on an indoor cycle. While riding a bicycle is low-impact, too much resistance may cause too much pressure for your knees to handle.

, Any exercise that locks your knees into a single position can be good. For hips, lie down on your back and perform straight-leg raises. For abs, most variations of the crunch should be fine. For calves, perform calf raises. For the upper body, perform pushups, pull-ups, and dips.

Walk on the balance beam.,
Skip the perimeter.,
Jog or jump rope.",How to Work Out on a Playground As an Adult1," Most playgrounds have wooden beams of various elevations. Even if there isn't a specific balance beam, you may be able to find a slightly raised surface or a curb that you can use for the same purpose.Walk slowly at first until you find your balance. Turn and walk back slightly faster, then gradually increase your speed each time you cross.
You also can lift each leg up to hip-height with each step, or add a kick to each step. Move your arms naturally at first, but you might experiment with clasping your hands behind your back or keeping your hands on your hips to see how that affects your balance.;
, If the playground has a walking trail or grass perimeter around it, use the space to your advantage. Skipping is a plyometric exercise that lightly builds fast-twitch muscle fiber while also boosting your mood.You also can incorporate arm movements to get an upper-body workout in addition to a cardiovascular warm-up. For example, you can swing your arms vigorously as you skip, or pump them up and down.
Skipping also is great for building strength and toning leg muscles. Do a 60-second skip as a cardio interval between other exercises.

, Jogging isn't necessarily a children's activity, but it's something that's easily accomplished in a park or around a playground. If you think you'd be embarrassed if people saw you skipping, then you might want to jog instead.Once you're warmed up, you might even consider challenging someone nearby to a short race.
Most playgrounds don't have jump ropes lying around, but if you have one of your own you can bring it with you and do a little jumping as a warm-up. Set the timer on your watch or phone and jump at a regular pace for five minutes for an effective cardiovascular warm-up.

If you're not strong enough to do repeated pull-ups or chin-ups, this exercise can help build the same muscles used for that exercise.Find a swing and grab the chains from which it hangs. Pull it back toward you, leaning back with your upper body. You may have to shift your feet a bit until you find a stable position.
Stop when you're at an angle from the ground – the deeper the angle, the more difficult the exercise.
Lean back so that your arms are straight, then pull up towards the swing, bringing your elbows to your side. Extend your arms and do three to five sets of 10 repetitions of this exercise.
To build the right muscles and avoid straining your wrists, focus on pulling from your elbows rather than using your hands.

, Using a swing to suspend your legs as you do knee tucks is a powerful workout for your lower body and your core that also increases your balance and stability since the swing can move freely.Put your toes on the swing and lean forward so that your hands are on the ground in front of the swing. Start in a position where your wrists are roughly in line with your shoulders. You may want to put the tops of your feet instead of your toes on the swing, if the seat of the swing isn't hard.
Pull your knees toward your chest, lifting your hips and pulling the swing itself forward. Then push back to the starting position. Keep your return movement slow and controlled, engaging your entire body.
Do 10 repetitions of this exercise in a set, and try to do between three and five sets.

, Swing-set split squats (also known as lunges) add an element of balance and stability just as knee tucks did. This exercise is efficient at building strength in your legs and glutes.Stand in front of the swing with your back to it, then bend one knee and place the top of your foot or your toes in the seat of the swing. You may have to move around a bit to find your balance and the best footing before you begin.
With your hands on your hips, slowly lower into a squat, keeping your front foot flat. Your back foot may drift back a little.
Stand with a controlled movement to complete the repetition. Do 10 repetitions for one set, then switch and do the other side. Do an even number of sets so you can ensure you're working out both legs evenly.

, Planks are a punishing workout for your core. If you want even more difficulty and strength-building, grip a swing and lower into a plank. The unstable swing makes the exercise more difficult.Make sure your feet are firm on the ground, and don't push the swing out any further than you can reach with stability, or you could end up falling face-first onto the ground.
You also can reverse these by hooking your feet around the swing and planting your hands firmly on the ground.
Check out the surface under the swing set before you start, and make sure it's smooth and firm. If the playground has wood chips, for example, you might find this exercise painful because the chips will dig into your palms if you have your hands on the ground. If you have a long-sleeve shirt on, then try resting your upper body weight on your forearms while your feet are on the swing.

Start with eccentric pull-ups or chin-ups.,
Use monkey bars for pull-ups and chin-ups.,
Travel across the monkey bars.,
Climb the ladder to the slide.,
Grab the rings.,
Do parallel and straight bar dips.,
Try inverted rows on a low bar or ladder.",How to Work Out on a Playground As an Adult3," If you can't accomplish more than one pull-up or chin-up, you may want to start with eccentric pull-ups or chin-ups and work your way up to the regular ones. To do an eccentric pull-up or chin-up, jump up and grab the bar – or climb and reach over. You want to be holding the bar with your head or chin above the bar. Hold that position for a second, then slowly lower yourself to the ground.


Make sure you control the descent. This is the negative movement in a pull-up or chin-up, but is easier to do and will help build your muscles.

, Monkey bars are perhaps the most obvious playground apparatus that you can use for working out. Pull-ups and chin-ups are powerful strength-building exercises for your upper body that use your entire body weight as resistance.Whether you're doing a pull-up or a chin-up depends on your grip. For a pull-up, you're going to grab the bar over-handed, with your palms facing away from you. When you do chin-ups, your palms are facing toward you.

, You may have enjoyed scrambling over monkey bars as a kid, but crossing them as an adult is a different matter with your entire body weight as resistance. Climbing and swinging across monkey bars builds core and grip strength.Start slow if you don't have the core and grip strength to travel across them at a pace. Once you're stronger, practice going forward and backward.
You also can incorporate sprints, in which you go forward and backward as fast as you can, as many times as you can, for 30 seconds. Use the sway in your body to build momentum.
Stretch your reach by only using every other rung, or keep your legs curled close to your body for a little added resistance and core stability.

, Going up a playground ladder just once won’t do much because they are not very tall. However, climbing up and down a playground ladder several times in quick succession will give your glutes and core a killer workout. You'll also increase your agility and strengthen your arms and shoulders as you move up and down.You can set a timer for 30 seconds to a minute and aim to sprint up and down the slide as many times as possible during that interval.
Make sure you're keeping focused on what you're doing and not going so fast that you miss a rung. If you aren't confident in your abilities or if the stairs don't seem stable, you may not want to do this at an all-out sprint.

, Many playgrounds have a set of rings, and these can be good for doing dead hangs, or for progressing to more difficult pull-ups. The fact that the rings aren't stationary makes the exercise more difficult.You also can use the rings to increase your body control while doing pull-ups or chin-ups. Swing counterclockwise, then try to reverse the rotation so you're swinging clockwise.
The rings are also good for improving your grip strength and building the muscles in your forearms with dead hangs or wrist curls.

, If the playground has parallel bars or a single high bar, you can do dips to build the strength in your chest and shoulder muscles, as well as your triceps. Monkey bars also might work if the rungs are far enough apart.When you do these exercises, lean forward slightly on the way down and brace your torso, engaging your core to keep yourself stable.
Grip the straight bar overhanded and extend your arms so that you're positioned with your torso over the bar. Leaning forward, brace your torso against the bar and lower until your elbows are bent behind you. Then raise back up and repeat. Do 10 repetitions of this exercise in a set.
Parallel bar dips require a little less strength than straight bar dips, so if you have access to both, you may want to start on the parallel bars and use the straight bar as a progression once you've built more upper-body strength.
Don’t lower yourself too far when doing dips. This may increase your risk of injury.

, If you enjoyed doing rows on a swing, you also can do inverted rows if you can find a low enough bar at the playground (about one meter from the ground) with room underneath it for you to lay down. One of the lower rungs of a slide ladder also might work, depending on how the ladder is built and where it's situated.You start inverted rows by grasping the bar with an overhand grip and extending your arms until you are hanging from the bar. Push your legs out until they are straight and you are resting on the ground on your heels. You will look like you are getting ready to do an upside down pushup.
Pull your body up to the bar or step the same way you did for swing rows. Pause with your elbows bent along your ribs, then lower yourself.
Do three to five sets of 10 repetitions of this exercise. You also can incorporate it as a high-intensity interval by doing as many repetitions as you can in 30 seconds.

Dip and kick.,
Work in sprints.,
Try jump squats.,
Include standard body-weight exercises.",How to Work Out on a Playground As an Adult4," The dip and kick exercise can be done on a park bench or table at the playground. This exercise can be punishing for your triceps, as well as working your thighs and your core.Find a bench the right height that when you sit on the edge, you have your feet flat on the ground and your knees are at 90-degree angles. Press your palms into the bench on either side of your body, lifting yourself up slightly off the bench. Pick one foot up so you're holding it slightly off the ground.
Lower yourself by bending your elbows to 90 degrees, pulling your knee close to your chest as you do.
As you straighten your arms to raise back up, kick your foot straight out in front of you. Complete 10 repetitions of this exercise, then switch sides and do another 10 repetitions with the other leg.

, As a kid, you may have enjoyed racing other kids from one playground apparatus to another. There's no reason why you can't continue to do this, and sprinting among the playground equipment adds a cardio interval to your overall workout.For example, if you were previously doing upper-body exercises on the monkey bars, you can sprint from the monkey bars to a bench on the other side of the playground. Run as fast as you can, tag the bench, run back to the monkey bars and tag them, then run back to the bench.
Once you've scoped out the playground and mapped out your routine based on the equipment available, you can work in these sprint bursts to get from one apparatus to another.

, Provided the bench is strong and stable enough, you can work jumps into a regular squat to add explosive movement and a touch of plyometric exercise to your workout, building fast-twitch muscle fiber.Check the playground for platforms that you can jump up on, or use a sturdy park bench if no one is using them.


To start, stand a couple feet away from the bench and jump up onto it. This is an exercise similar to box jumps that you'd do in a gym. Aim to land softly, and step back down carefully rather than jumping back down off the bench.
Try to do this exercise as quickly as possible, doing as many as you can do in 30 seconds.
You can progress to jump squats, in which you lower into a squat and then jump onto the bench.
This exercise works best, and is safer, if you're on relatively level ground. However, you can also try doing jump squats onto the swings if the seats are flat and sturdy enough. Just hold onto the swing chains and jump up onto the swing seat. Then step back down and start over.

, Any of your basic body-weight exercises, such as planks and lunges, can be done anywhere you've got a little space. A playground or park can provide the perfect space to fit these exercises into your routine.Standard body-weight exercises can work as filler if you're trying to design an interval-training workout, especially if there are kids running around on the playground as well and you need to time your access to the different equipment.
For example, you might do swing rows for a minute, then do a lower-body exercise such as lunges, then move to a whole-body or core exercise such as planks or clapping planks and do those.
Working different muscle groups at a time allows you to decrease your rest time between intervals, making for a quicker and more efficient workout.

Place the Fitbit around your wrist.,
Adjust the straps until you achieve the desired fit.,
Secure the straps.",How to Wear a Fitbit1," Line up the device so that the display sits on the top (or backside) of your wrist. This will allow you to get a clear look at the readout anytime, whether you’re out for a jog or just checking the time.Make sure the display is facing the right way so that it will be visible whenever you look down.
It’s also possible to strap your Fitbit to an ankle if you need to keep your hands free, though this may skew your stats.;
, Wrap the straps around either side of your wrist until they overlap. Holding the device with one hand, slide the top strap along the series of holes in the bottom strap until you find the setting that feels best.Aim for a fit that's snug but not too tight.
You should be able to slide the Fitbit about half an inch up or down your arm without difficulty., Insert the double clasp into the two holes that correspond to your ideal fit, then press them firmly until they click into place. If you’re wearing a model with a traditional buckle, like the Charge 2 or Surge, run the top strap through the buckle, then guide the prong into the desired hole and pull to tighten.Brand new bands can be a little stiff. It may help to flex or practice snapping them closed a few times to loosen them up.
To keep the Fitbit from coming undone, make sure the clasps have been pushed all the way through both holes.

Wear the Fitbit on whichever wrist you prefer.,
Keep the band relaxed and comfortable throughout the day.,
Tighten it up for intense activity.,
Place the tracker on another part of your body.",How to Wear a Fitbit2," For most users, Fitbit recommends wearing the tracker on your non-dominant side. However, the decision is ultimately up to you. With a few basic tweaks, the device will function just as well on either arm.If you’d rather wear your Fitbit on your dominant hand, you can adjust the settings to account for the extra movement, which may influence your activity reports.Your Fitbit can double as an all-in-one timepiece when placed on the wrist you usually wear your watch on.

, Straps that are clasped too tight can begin to irritate your wrist when worn for hours on end. Let your arm breathe a bit by leaving a space of about half an inch between your wrist and the band of the Fitbit. This will ensure that it never becomes a distraction.


The device should be able to move up and down your wrist naturally as you run, cycle, row or lift weights.
It’s usually best to not wear your Fitbit continuously for more than about an hour at a time., There may be times (like during a climb or in the middle of an intense Crossfit session) when you want to make sure that your Fitbit stays where it is. In these situations, cinch the band closer around your wrist. It's important that you don't wear the band too tight—just secure it enough to keep it from bouncing around as you move.To prevent the band from pinching or cutting off your circulation, push it up a couple inches above your wrist, around the spot where you would normally take your pulse.In addition to staying in place better, the Fitbit will have an easier time keep track of your heart rate and subtle movements when worn a little closer to the skin., Though the Fitbit was designed to be worn like an ordinary watch, it can still be just as useful when sported in a less cumbersome fashion. The Fitbit One and Fitbit Zip models, for instance, give you the option of clipping the tracker to your shoe, sports bra or some other article of clothing so that it doesn’t get in the way during a workout.Try attaching the tracker to a belt or armband, slipping it in your pocket or looping it around the handlebars of your bike.
Wearing your Fitbit somewhere other than your wrist may make your readings less accurate.

"
"
Keep your Fitbit charged.,
Clean your Fitbit band periodically.,
Change out the band.",How to Wear a Fitbit3," Hook your device up to its charger overnight or anytime you’re not using it to assess your activity levels. A full battery will guarantee access to all your charts and features and let the device sync with other apps, like Mobile Run or Strava.Disabling unnecessary features (such as All-Day Sync, which enables the Fitbit to pass information back and forth with your smartphone) can greatly improve your device’s battery life.Watch your battery level closely to make sure your Fitbit doesn’t die on you when during exercise.

, Most bands can simply be wiped down with a little rubbing alcohol or a mild water-based cleaning solution. For heavier buildup due to sweat, sunscreen and other substances, try scrubbing the inside of the band lightly with a soft-bristled toothbrush.Avoid using soaps, as these can leave behind residues that can cause skin irritation.Don’t submerge your Fitbit or clean it with extremely hot or cold water.

, Fitbit bands come in a wide range of colors and materials, including nylon, metal, stretchy synthetic elastomer and all-natural leather. Try out various bands to find the one that’s most comfortable for you and allows for maximum movement and versatility. You could have a different band for every day of the week!


A band's performance depends largely on what it's made from. Elastomer, for example, will provide the greatest amount of flexibility and comfort, while rugged materials like leather and nylon offer exceptional durability.
Bands in neutral colors will wear just as well with a dress shirt and slacks as shorts and a tank top."

Perform basic pushups.,
Perform incline pushups.,
Perform elevated pushups.,
Perform gorilla pushups.,
Perform single-leg pushups.,
Perform backpack pushups.",How to Work Out Chest Muscles without Weights1," There are many variations of pushups that can help you build your chest muscles, but for beginners, there's nothing wrong with basic, ordinary pushups.That said, when starting push ups, avoid lowering your chest too close to the ground. Lowering yourself too close to the floor can tear tissues in the shoulder. Gradually work your way to lowering yourself slightly closer to the floor over time.


Lie face down with your hands on the floor directly under their respective shoulders. Straighten your back so that your feet and your shoulders create a straight, rigid line.
One repetition consists of bending your arms down to a 90 degree angle and straightening them out again.
Raise and lower your body in a slow, steady motion. Do as many of these as you can!
If you are an absolute beginner, you may need to start out doing pushups with your knees on the floor, but your hips and back straight.;
, These are similar to basic pushups, but your body is elevated by a piece of furniture such as a bench, chair, or desk that you rest your hands against.Lie face down with you hands on the bench. Position your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, and your feet about hip-width apart, with your toes on the floor. Keep your back and legs as straight as you can.
Then, slowly and steadily lower your body so that your chest is just a few inches from the bench.
Return to the starting position by straightening your arms, and repeat.
Incline pushups are an easy variation, making them great for beginners., Find a sturdy chair or bench that won't slide across the ground and is able to hold your weight. Then, get into the basic pushup position, but place your feet on the chair rather than on the ground. Straighten your back so that your feet and your body creates a horizontal line parallel with the floor.Place the chair up against the wall for extra stability.
One repetition consists of bending your arms down to a 90 degree angle and straightening them out again.

, To perform gorilla pushups, start as if you were doing basic pushups, with your body in the down position. Then, rapidly push up, launching yourself off the ground. Slap your chest or clap, then rapidly return your hands to the starting position.Gorilla pushups are are a more advanced pushup variation. Don't try these until you can comfortably do lots of basic pushups.

, Start in the basic pushup position, with your feet spread to shoulder width or wider. Lift one foot so that it is hovering off of the ground and then complete each repetition just as you would with a basic pushup.After doing a few repetitions, switch legs. For example, try to do five single-leg pushups with your left leg raised, then do another five with the right raised.
Keep your glutes tight while doing these.If you want to, you can exercise your legs at the same time by moving the knee of the raised leg toward your elbow as you push up, and switching legs with each repetition. Some people call these, ""reptile"" or ""lizard"" pushups.The wider apart your feet are, the harder the push up will be, because it will shift more of your weight to one arm.Single-leg pushups are among the most challenging variations.You will probably need to work up to these.

, If normal pushups and pushup variations begin to grow too easy, you can increase the weight and stress of the pushups to keep your workout rigorous. One easy way to do that is to perform any of the above pushup variations while wearing a backpack.You can steadily increase the weight as your muscles develop by placing heavier objects in the backpack.

Find something to support your body.,
Start doing dips.,
Perform backpack dips.,
Change the position of your feet.",How to Work Out Chest Muscles without Weights2," Dips are most easily performed on parallel bars in a gym. However, you can improvise using a very sturdy chair. Stairs or the edge of a bathtub may also work.Make sure the chair is sturdy and stable. If it breaks or moves while doing this exercise, you may be injured.
Do not attempt this on hardwood floors or other smooth surfaces that might allow the chair to slide easily.

, Sit on the edge of your chair or other support. Place the heel of your palm on either side of your seat, with the fingers curved over the edge. Lower yourself until your arms are at a 90 degree angle, then raise yourself up until your arms are straight again.Dips are a great way to work out the inner chest muscles, which are often under-exercised with pushups.
For beginners, you can actually do dips with your hands on the seat and your legs stretched out in front of you and the backs of your heels touching the floor.When beginning dips, be careful with how far you lower yourself. Slowly increase your range until you can lower your torso to a 90-degree bend in the elbow. The elbow should never bend more than 90 degrees, or else a shoulder injury can occur.

, When normal dips become too easy, you will need to increase the weight and stress of the dips. Wearing a backpack is a simple and easy way to do that, and you'll be able to gradually add weight to the backpack to suit your workout needs.

, You can increase the difficulty of dips by changing the position of your feet. One way to do this is to elevate the feet by placing them on a chair. You can also lift one leg off the ground while doing the dips."

Do chest stretches.,
Do elbows-back repetitions.,
Do behind-the-head stretches.",How to Work Out Chest Muscles without Weights3," Stand with your arms extended in front of you and your palms together. Then, keeping your elbows straight, quickly move your arms back as far as possible and then back in again to the starting position.Do ten of these, and increase your speed with each repetition.
This exercise also works your back.

, Stand up straight, placing both hands on your lower back. Point your fingers downward and elbows out. Then, gently move your elbows back and inward as far as you can, as if to touch them together. Then, return to the starting position, and repeat.This exercise also works your shoulders.

, Sit upright on the floor with a partner standing behind you. Put your hands behind your head, and push your elbows back as far as you are able to. Then, have your partner hold your elbows while you gently attempt to pull your elbows forward, keeping your hands in place.Each repetition of this should be about 10 seconds.
Your partner should not allow your elbows to move while you are pulling them forward.
After each repetition, relax, and have your partner pull your elbows back as far as is comfortable to stretch the chest muscles.
To avoid injury, be sure to let your partner know when to stop pulling.
This exercise also works the shoulders.

Determine a goal.,
Understand and implement all components of exercise.,
Set up a long term progression and schedule.,
Set up the meso-cycles.,
Set up a workout session.,
Log workouts and systematically increase frequency, intensity and/or duration.",How to Work Out if You Are Not a Body Builder," Common goals include reducing weight or body fat percentage, increasing strength, improving sports performance, rehabbing an injury, etc. Next, some sort of initial testing should be conducted to establish benchmarks. Plan to re-test every 6-8 weeks to measure progress and determine if any adjustments need to be made to the program.;
, The major components of exercise include resistance training, cardiovascular training and flexibility training. Resistance training can challenge balance, endurance, strength and power. Resistance training not only impacts muscle but also the strength and health of bones, tendons, cartilage and ligaments. Resistance training includes exercises for core (spine and pelvis musculature), upper extremity (shoulder and elbow musculature) and lower extremity (hip, knee and ankle musculature). Cardiovascular training includes aerobic (with oxygen, lower intensity) and anaerobic (without oxygen, higher intensity) exercise. Flexibility training includes static, active and dynamic exercises.

, There is much more to working out than picking a body part to train or deciding between the bike or the elliptical. A yearly schedule is ideal. If this sounds intimidating, just consider that most people fail to accomplish their fitness goals because they don't understand the effort and commitment it takes to get there. It takes 6-12 months to accomplish most goals. Then a maintenance schedule needs to be set up. To have an impact, exercise needs to be part of everyday life like driving to work or brushing teeth. It absolutely needs to be planned out. It needs to become habitual. A yearly schedule is called a macro-cycle. This can be further broken into meso-cyles (monthly) and micro-cycles (weekly). A good way to set up the yearly schedule is in quarters: Jan-Mar, Apr-Jun, Jul-Sept and Oct-Dec. So, a year is consists of a workout cycle that is repeated 4 times. A quarter then consists of 3 different 1-month phases or goals. A month or phase has a unique weekly training schedule.

, Use an endurance, strength, power progression. Endurance builds the foundation for strength which in turn builds the foundation for power. Month 1 - resistance training: muscular endurance (2-3 days per week, total body, 2-3 sets, 12-20 reps); cardiovascular training: aerobic base (3 days per week, 20-30 minutes, mostly low intensity exercise); flexibility training: each workout, static stretching. Month 2 - resistance training: muscular size and strength (4 days per week, push/pull split, 3-4 sets, 6-12 reps); cardiovascular training: aerobic endurance (4 days per week, 20-40 minutes, low and medium intensity workouts); flexibility training: each workout, active stretching. Month 3 - resistance training: muscular power (4 days per week, upper/lower split, 4-5 sets, 1-6 reps; cardiovascular training: aerobic and anaerobic endurance (5 days per week, 20-60 minutes, low, medium and high intensity workouts), optional speed/power training; flexibility training: each workout, dynamic stretching.

, This is where most people who exercise will be blown away by the difference between what they are doing and what they should be doing. A workout session consists of 8 steps.


Specific stretching for known muscular imbalances, postural distortions and injuries.
Warm up.
3-4 Core exercises.
1-2 Balance exercises.
1-2 Reactive (plyometric) exercises.
6-10 Strength exercises (upper and/or lower body).
Cardiovascular training (aerobic and/or anaerobic).
Cool down and stretching. The 3-month cycle and this 8-step workout session is known as integrated training. This is a more comprehensive, safe and effective way to exercise. This approach will train all the systems and functions of the body. To get the most out of training, the body needs to function correctly. It takes much more than a few arm circles, toe touches, 6 sets of bench and 12 sets of curls to get to your goal. If all you have is a hammer in your toolbox, then everything will begin to look like a nail.

, With resistance training, set a rep goal and increase weight used for that repetition range. Another way to progress strength training is to increase the work performed in a given amount of time. With cardiovascular exercise set a minimum frequency, intensity (heart rate) and duration. First, increase duration, then increase frequency. After frequency, then increase intensity. Your body adapts to the demand you place on it. If all you do is sit in an office or watch TV, then your body will be in just good enough shape to do this. So, with regular exercise your body will change. But you must constantly make your body perform more than it did before if you want it to keep changing. As your body improves from a physiological and biomechanical standpoint, then your body will change on the outside too. The above described program has a progression built into it that will ensure that your body doesn't get used to doing too much of the same thing and stop changing.

Take active rest days.",How to Work Out Quietly," No one likes being next that guy at the gym - either on the treadmill or in the weight room - who seems to be over-exaggerated his breathing. Intense huffing and puffing can be distracting to others, so focus on how you're breathing to control and regulate your breath.


Focusing on your breath will help bring your attention to the sound, depth and rate of your breathing. This can help keep you a little more quiet, but may even improve your workouts.When you're lifting weights, fitness professionals suggest that you exhale as you contract a muscle or muscle group and inhale when you're relaxing from the contraction.For cardio, your breath should be steady and even-paced. Studies have actually shown improvements with running when the beginning of your exhale coincides with the strike of your heel on the pavement.
Breathing during stretching and recovery may actually be the loudest type of ""workout breathing."" Breathe in deeply and fill your whole abdomen up with air. Avoid lifting your shoulders up and down - this is ineffective. Try to breathe slowly and deeply as this promotes more oxygen in your lungs.;
, Your downstairs neighbors probably don't appreciate hearing you jumping up and down for your morning workouts. Focus on the proper, safe and quietest methods of jumping to decrease the overall noise coming from your workouts.


Landing softly and correctly not only helps quiet your workouts, but also decreases the risk for injuries. Landing incorrectly may lead to a blown out knee or a sprained ankle.One of the most important aspects of landing appropriately and softly is flexibility. As you land, bend your knees. At the end of your jump or landing, you should almost be in a full squat position.
Also, always begin your landings on the ball of your feet, slowly rolling back towards distributing your weight on your entire foot. This method of landing also helps force you to flex your knees and encourage the squat-like position in your landing., Another time you might find yourself making a lot of noise is when you're jogging or running on a treadmill. The way your foot falls may sound like a very loud splatting or thudding noise. Proper running form is naturally more quieter and safer.When you run more naturally, fitness professionals say your stride and footsteps are much more quiet. In addition, you reduce your risk of overuse injuries caused by excessive impact.Many runners have been told to run ""heel to toe."" However, now fitness and running coaches are suggesting that you hit the ground midfoot instead of at the heel.The next time you're out for a jog or run, focus on where your foot naturally falls and aim to hit the ground midfoot and roll forward to your toe to push off again.
Also make sure that your foot falls underneath your hip, not far out in front of you. This helps over striding (which can lead to injury) which makes running louder.

, If you're a regular in the weight room or have invested in your own home gym or free weight sets, make sure you're mindful in how you're using them and setting them down. This is where a lot of noise can be made.


If you're using free weights, it's important to set them down gently on the rack, floor or bench. Letting them drop from your hands or pushing them off of you after completing a repetition makes for loud, banging sounds.
This misuse of the weights can also lead to damage of the floors, the weights themselves and if they land on your foot, an injury for you.
When you're using a weight machine at the gym or at home, aim for slow and controlled movements. It may be natural for you to finish a repetition and then release the weight and have it slam back to original position.
Even when releasing a contraction or finishing an exercise, it's equally beneficial to your body, progress and the ears of other gym members to finish slowly. The release of an exercise works your muscles just as hard as the contraction, so there's a benefit to not letting the weights fly out of your hands., Some exercises require the use of a yoga or fitness mat (generally out of comfort). However, these thick, foam pads may also help dampen the noise of your workouts as well.


If you don't have one, consider purchasing a yoga mat or fitness mat. They come in a variety of thicknesses, so choose one that works best for your typical exercise routine. However, the thicker the mat, the more sound and shock they will absorb.These mats can be used for many, many exercises - not just a typical yoga routine. You can do cardio exercises on them - especially if you're at home doing a cardio DVD, walking video or doing at home HIIT (high intensity interval training) exercises.
They're especially great for plyometric exercises like jumping jacks, squat jumps and burpees as they can help make for a softer landing, but also absorb more shock and sound when you land. However, be careful when putting your mat on a hard surface (like wood floors) because the mat can slip.

, If you want to stick to a regular strength training routine, but are looking for a quieter method, consider doing yoga. This is a naturally quieter form of exercise but can be great for strength.


One of the reasons yoga is more quiet is that there are no explosive movements, no plyometric jumping or use of any free weights or weight machines.
In addition, yoga requires the use of a mat (or at least a carpeted floor) which also absorbs the shock and sound from exercise.Yoga helps strengthen, lengthen and tone muscles. It requires you to control and focus on your breathing and uses very slow and controlled movements. All reasons why this is a more quiet form of exercise., Running or jogging, especially on the treadmill, is going to be a little noisy. There's only so much you can do to dampen the sound of your feet. However, think about doing other forms of cardio instead.


If you're interested in doing some at home cardio or are looking to purchase a cardio machine for your apartment consider a stair master, elliptical or stationary bike. These machines make some noise as they are being used, but its very minimal.
In addition, these machines are more low-impact and there are not hard landings when you're using them. This also makes them a better choice for those with joint or knee pain.

, Another option for strength training is using free weights or calisthenics. As long as you control how you're doing these exercises (especially free weights), its much quieter than using a home gym or weight machines.


When using free weights, make sure you set them down quietly, instead of dropping them on the floor. Otherwise, these are incredibly quiet and won't disturb neighbors or others at the gym.
Calisthenics are exercises that use your own body weight for resistance (often known as body weight exercises). They require little to no equipment and are very, very quiet.Examples of strengthening exercises you can do include: push-ups, crunches, planks, tricep push-ups and squats.

, Although there are a variety of exercises that do not make much noise, there are some types of exercises or programs that you should avoid due to noise.


Many HIIT (high intensity interval training) workouts contain a lot of plyometric exercises - which makes them great at burning a lot of calories and building muscle. However, if you're jumping around a lot for a workout, your neighbors or roommates might not appreciate all the noise.
If you use a treadmill in your apartment or home as well, you might want to consider limiting its use early in the mornings or in the evenings when others around you may be sleeping.

, Even though you're aiming to keep your workouts on the quieter side, still aim for the required 150 minutes of cardiovascular exercises each week.Even quiet aerobic exercises still provide a vast array of health benefits. These types of exercises work your heart and lungs and can help reduce the risk of high blood pressure and diabetes, improve your mood, help maintain a healthy weight and reduce your risk for developing heart disease.150 minutes or about 2 1/2 hours is the minimum you need to do each week. You can split this up into small bouts. For example, a 10 minute workout or walk 3 times a day Monday through Friday will help you reach this goal.
Choose quieter activities like: using the elliptical, walking on the treadmill, using a spin bike or walking DVD's.
Also consider asking your neighbors or roommates when a good time for you to do louder exercises would be. You can do a plyometrics routine or longer run on the treadmill if no one is around.

, In addition to cardiovascular exercises, it's also important to stay regular with strength training. Most professionals recommend to do these types of exercises about 1 or 2 times per week.This minimum guideline helps provide additional health benefits to the ones provided by cardio. Strength training specifically helps strengthen bones, builds muscle mass and supports your metabolism.Things like yoga, calisthenics and free weights are great options to include if you're looking for a quieter routine.

, Another great way to add in physical activity to your normal routine is to increase your lifestyle activity. Most of these are done away from the home so you don't necessarily have to worry about making much noise.


Lifestyle activities are those that you do on a typical day. It might be walking to the mail box, sweeping the floor or taking the stairs to your office. Although some of these activities do cause noise, they're part of daily living and don't last a long time.
Some studies have shown that lifestyle activity, when increased, has similar health benefits to more structured cardio (like going for a jog).Try to increase the amount of movement or steps you take in a day. Focus on activities outside the home so you can continue to keep a quieter environment where you live. For example, take the stairs to your office, park farther away, use a bathroom on another floor, take a walk break over lunch or even skip emails and deliver messages to co-workers in person.

, Rest days are also important to your physical activity routine. They not only help your body recover and rest, but may be a great way to give your roommates or neighbors some quiet time.


Studies have shown that its actually during rest that your muscles grow in size and strength. Without rest days you won't make very much progress with your exercise routine.Most fitness professionals recommend at least one, maybe two rest days per week. You should still be active - maybe going for a walk instead of a run - but need to avoid more high impact or higher intensity workouts.
Try to schedule rest days when your roommates or neighbors are around or home more often. For example, if people sleep in later on Sundays and want to enjoy a quieter day, schedule a rest day for Sunday so it coincides with other's schedules.

Choose the right fitness ball for your height and weight.,
If you are of average weight and you are under 5'3"" (160 cm), you should choose a 55 cm (21.7 inch) diameter exercise ball.,
Buy a burst-resistant exercise ball.,
Purchase your ball at a store that allows returns if the ball is not the right size.,
Pump up the ball, aiming to pump it up to maximum diameter so that you do not sink too far into the ball.

,
Sit up straight on the ball with your legs out in front of you.,
Bend your elbows and place your forearms at a 90 degree angle.,
Practice active sitting.,
Use the ball in 20 minute intervals.",How to Use an Exercise Ball As a Chair," Measure your current chair and aim to have the diameter of the ball be about 4 inches (10.2 cm) higher than your current chair.;
, If you are between 5'3"" and 6' (160 and 182.9 cm) you should choose a 65 cm (25.6 inch) diameter exercise ball. If you are over 6 feet (182.9 cm) tall, you should probably use a 75 cm (29.5 inch) diameter exercise ball.

, These balls have an extra strong layer between the inside cavity and the environment. Offices and homes often have sharp objects like scissors, staples, paper clips and other items that can cause an office exercise ball to pop.

, You will not know for sure that the ball will fit your desk and chair until you try it out in your home or office.

,, They should be at a 90 degree angle to your thighs and parallel to the ball.


At first, you can place your calves in front of you so that they are touching the ball. This will give you added stability while learning to use the ball. Later, you will want to move your calves so they are not touching, which will provide more benefits for your core.

, Reaching forward slightly, you should be able to rest them on the top of the desk or table.


If you are using a computer, make sure it is at a 90 degree angle. If it is not, your neck will be out of alignment with the rest of your spine, and the ball will be less useful in helping your posture.

, This is the state when your body reacts to the prospect of falling off the ball by tightening your core muscles in your stomach and back. Flex the muscles in your abdomen to add an extra element of exercise.

, Do not get rid of your office chair. Just like exercise, it is important to give your muscles rest to prevent muscle fatigue and get the maximum benefit.


Work up to 30 minute intervals as you get used to the chair. Doctors do not recommend that you sit for longer than 30 minutes at a time. If you need to get up to change chairs frequently, this will also benefit your spine.

Walk barefoot in the sand.,
Go for a jog.,
Go for a swim.,
Do interval or circuit training.,
Play games.,
Hit the boardwalk.,
Grab a board.,
Incorporate bodyweight exercises.,
Bring a small set of weights to the beach.,
Use a beach ball or exercise ball for more exercises.,
Do yoga on the beach.,
Bring a water bottle.,
Use sunscreen.,
Get a fitness mat or towel.,
Wear sunglasses or a hat.",How to Work Out at the Beach," There's nothing better than going for a nice long walk on the beach. Even a leisurely walk can offer a great workout when you're not wearing any shoes.


Walking is one the of the oldest forms of exercise. It's a low-impact and low-intensity exercise that many people can perform regardless of their fitness level.Walking barefoot on the beach offers additional benefits compared to walking with shoes on a hard surface like a sidewalk. Without shoes, you're forced to engage more of the small muscles in your feet, ankles and calves.In fact, some studies show that walking barefoot on the sand (at an easy pace) burns 2.5 times the energy compared to walking on a flat surface.
To make sure you get a good workout, walk in the dry sand (not wet sand) as this is softer and requires more work from your legs.
You may also want to consider walking in the water. The water adds a lot more resistance to your legs and body and will burn more calories as well.
Do make sure you watch where you step — there may be sharp objects, such as broken shells, barnacles, or even broken glass on the beach.;
, Jogging or running is a great form of aerobic exercise. It burns a significant amount of calories and can strengthen your cardiovascular system. Running or jogging on the beach offers additional benefits since it works your body harder.If you choose to go for a run on the beach, running in the softer, deeper sand will work your calves and glutes significantly more compared to wetter, harder sand.However, if you're not looking for a particularly butt-kicking workout, wait until lower tide so you have more wet sand (which is firmer) to run on.
Also note that most beaches have a slight slant to them. This can be difficult on your legs, especially your hips. So plan to run out and back so you equally stress both sides of your body., If you're at the beach, take advantage of the water and the opportunity to do some swimming. Unless you have access to a beach or pool, you're probably not able to use swimming as a form of aerobic exercise. Take a dip in the ocean to get in a great cardio workout.


If you can swim, try going for a swim in the ocean. Remember, swimming in the ocean is more difficult than a pool due to the current and waves. You should be a fairly experienced swimmer if you plan on staying out for awhile.
It's a low-impact exercise so it's great for those who have joint problems or pain in their feet or legs.
In addition, some studies have shown that swimming specifically can help decrease stress and increase your sense of well-being. Swimming has also been linked to decreased anxiety and depression.Make sure a lifeguard is on duty or you have someone at the beach with you while swimming.
Always swim along the shore, never straight out into the open water. You could find yourself carried out by currents or caught in a riptide. Be very aware of the current conditions where you plan to swim. There might be a long shore current, riptides, or undertows.

, Both interval and circuit training are higher intensity exercises that can burn more calories (especially from fat) than more traditional, steady-state exercises (like walking).Interval training can be done with any type of steady-state exercise like walking, jogging or swimming. Alternate between short bouts of higher intensity levels of the exercise and short bouts of moderate-intensity exercise.
For example, you can walk at a moderate pace for a minute or two and then do a slow jog or brisk walk for a few minutes. You can also alternate between a slower jog and a sprint for another type of interval training.
Circuit training includes a series of multiple aerobic exercises that you go through to complete a workout. Set up stations or write up a list of the exercises you want to use in your circuit.
For example, you can go through a series of exercises like the following: jumping jacks, squat jumps, mountain climbers, the plank, warrior pose, bear crawl or burpees.

, If you've hit the beach with your friends or family, take advantage of the extra people to start up a fun beach game. You can enjoy the company of others and the fun of a game to help you get in a good workout.Playing a sport not only helps you get in a good workout, it also helps you strengthen social bonds, helps you relax and can decrease stress and anxiety.Sports that you can play on the beach that can also double as a workout include: soccer, paddle ball, volleyball, ultimate frisbee, or even just a game of catch. Running to catch a ball or bottle of sunscreen can be great exercise.
You may want to combine play sports with more traditional cardio and strength training for the most well-rounded workout each week.

, If the beach you're at has a boardwalk, this is a great place to do some more cardio exercises. It'll serve as a great surface for a variety of exercises since it's hard and flat.


Running is a great exercise to do on the boardwalk. It's especially useful if you're having difficulty running in the sand or you're not a fan of the sand.
You can also ride your bike on the boardwalk. This might be better than riding in the sand as the salt water and sand may cause rusting on the bike. Since most beaches have beach bike rentals, you may want to consider a rental if you don't have your own bike.
If you have a pair of rollerblades, strap them on for another great workout. If you don't have a pair, you may also find rentals for these as well.
Boardwalks can be pretty crowded. Try going out for your run or bike ride earlier in the morning. Even evenings can get crowded, so mornings may be your best bet.

, Whether it's a boogie board, surfboard or skim board, there are a variety of fun and sporty exercises you can do in the water. Regardless of which one you try, you'll get in a great workout.


Using a boogie board (or even just your own body - body surfing), will help you be able to burn a lot of calories. In addition, boogie boarding requires the use of your legs, core and back muscles which can help strengthen these big muscle groups.Like boogie boarding, surfing requires a lot of energy. You'll burn a lot of calories and strengthen your arms and back muscles as you paddle out. When you're up the board, you'll strengthen your core and leg muscles as you hold yourself up.
Skim boarding is a newer beach sport. However, it can be difficult as it requires you to run after your board consistently and use your leg and core muscles to stabilize yourself on the board.
Use any of these beach boarding sports as a fun way to work out. Make sure you're surfing or boarding for at least 30 minutes to get a good workout in.
Be aware of your surroundings. Getting really worn out playing in the surf can lead to accidents. Once you feel yourself getting tired in the water, swimming or boogie boarding, it’s a good idea to take your exercise on land.

, Incorporating bodyweight exercises for a beach workout is a great idea as you don't need any special equipment.Include a variety of these exercises to help strengthen your muscles:


Push-ups or tricep push-ups
Planks and crunches
Squats and lunges
Back extensions
Front and side leg lifts

, If you want to be able to do a more diverse set of exercises, consider bringing a small set of hand weights with you to the beach. You can use these in combination with some of your body weight exercises.Try:


Bicep curls
Tricep extensions
Shoulder presses
Deltoid raises
Reverse flys
Weighted squats or lunges

, If you're not interested in dragging a set of weights with you to the beach (they may get a little heavy), consider bringing a beach or exercise ball with you. Both types of balls will serve the same purpose. You can use either to help strengthen a variety of muscles.Try these ball exercises:


Twisting v-sit crunches
Leg to arm hand off crunches
Leg raises (using the beach ball underneath your tailbone)
Side plank raises (holding the ball in-between your shins)

, Yoga is a great exercise to do on the beach. It helps strengthen a variety of muscles (especially your core) but also helps you improve your mind body connection while enjoying the serene view of your beach.Bring your yoga mat or beach towel to the beach. This will help keep your hands and feet from getting too sandy. Try to put your mat on harder, more firm wet sand as this will help you maintain your balance and stay in your postures.
If you aren't familiar with a particular yoga routine, consider downloading a yoga podcast or video to your smartphone or tablet. Play your video or podcast so you can follow along outside.
You may also just want to write down a few poses on a piece of paper to bring with you to the beach to remind you which postures you want to cycle through.

, Staying adequately hydrated is important any time of the day - whether you're exercising or not. However, because you're exercising on the beach, you may be more prone to dehydration due to the weather.


If you're planning to workout at the beach (or even at the gym or at home), make sure that you bring a filled water bottle with you. You may want to consider putting in some ice cubes or freezing 1/3 of your water bottle to keep it cool while at the beach.
In general, you should bring about 10 oz (0.5 to 1.0 litres) of water for every 20 minutes of exercise.You may need more than this if you're working out longer, working out in the sun or if it's a particularly hot day at the beach.
You may even want to consider bringing a sports or electrolyte drink. This will help hydrate you quicker and more effectively than water when you're losing a lot of sweat through the heat and exercise.In addition, if you're planning on exercising at the beach, make sure you stay hydrated before and after your workout as well. Aim for at least eight to 13 additional glasses of fluid daily to maintain proper hydration., Another essential item to bring with you to your beach workout is sunscreen. Even if you don't think it's particularly sunny, it's important to cover any exposed parts of your body with adequate amounts of sunscreen to prevent burns.


Put on your sunscreen at least 20–30 minutes prior to your exercise routine. This allows your skin to fully absorb the sunscreen prior to you sweating.Use a broad spectrum sunscreen with at least an SPF of 30; however, if you've had previous incidences with skin cancer, it's recommended to use an SPF of 50. Make sure whatever sunscreen you choose is water and sweat resistant.In addition to wearing adequate sunscreen, health professionals recommend staying out of the sun and doing your workouts either before 10 am or after 3 pm as during this time the sun rays are the strongest and can be the most damaging.If you don't have sunscreen wear long sleeves, lightweight long pants and a hat with a brim to help protect your skin from the sun's rays as much as possible.

, Although there are plenty of exercises that you can do on the beach without any equipment, to get a great, well-rounded workout, you may want to consider bringing some items to help keep you comfortable.


If you want to do yoga, some circuit training or strength training exercises, you may want to invest in a fitness or yoga mat to bring with you. Also get a mat bag or tie so you can keep it rolled up tightly so it's more convenient to carry back and forth to the beach.
If you do not have a fitness mat, you can use a large beach or bath towel. Also bring a smaller towel to help wash sweat away from your eyes or to wipe sand off of your hands.

, Your skin is not the only part of your body that's susceptible to sun damage. Your eyes can also get damaged as you spend more and more time on the beach working out.Too much exposure to UV light can damage the eyes and increase the risk of eye diseases like cataracts, ""snow blindness"" and cancer.Make sure you wear UV-blocking sunglasses and a hat with a wide brim to block the sun's harmful rays from hitting your eyes.
Sunglasses may feel annoying or irritating as you workout. They can slide off your face or down your nose as you get sweaty. Look for sport or athletic sunglasses that are fit a little tighter on your face and have material on the bridge to help prevent them from sliding down your face.

Hold yourself accountable.",How to Use Virtual Personal Training," There are a great number of websites that offer virtual personal training, as well as mobile apps. While these have a number of similarities, you should be able to narrow them down based on your budget and personal fitness goals.If you know anyone who uses virtual personal training, ask them which site or app they use, and how their experience has been. If your budget, time constraints, and interests are similar to theirs, this can be a good way to find sites or apps that you might like.
Think about the types of exercise that you enjoy, and the equipment you have available. For example, you don't want to hire a virtual running coach if you hate running. Likewise, you don't need to bother with a site that focuses on lifting weights if you don't own a weight bench or other equipment you could use.;
, Determine how much you can afford to spend on virtual personal training services, then figure out how much each site or app will cost you. If prices are not listed up front, move on to another site that is more open about costs.Some services require you to pay a membership fee, then charge per day or per hour for personal training. In those cases, you'll need to think about how often you want to use virtual personal training.

, Virtual personal training sites and apps should have a detailed listing of each of the trainers on their staff, along with their background, training focus, and certifications.Check to ensure that all trainers are accredited by a government or well-respected independent organization. For example, if you are in the United States (or looking for an American trainer), you might look for a personal trainer certified by the American Council on Exercise (ACE).
Virtual trainers ideally will have several years of experience as a personal trainer, as well as experience as a virtual personal trainer. Keep in mind that it can take some time for a trainer to adjust to the differences between training someone online as opposed to in person.
If you have any particular physical or medical conditions, look for trainers who have experience working with people similar to you. Generally, you should look for a site or app that has several trainers who specialize in working with people of similar age, gender, and fitness level to you.

, If you find the website or app that you'll have to use confusing or difficult to navigate, you'll be less likely to get the full benefit of your virtual personal training services. Once you've narrowed down your list, find out if they have a tour.You may be able to look around the site on your own, or the majority of the site may be restricted to members only. If the site offers a trial membership, you may want to consider trying a few of those so you can make a more informed decision about which one you want to use.
Make sure you understand how to access your personal workouts, how to communicate with your trainer, and how to review your progress or results. Take notes about anything that seems confusing or counter-intuitive.

, Before you commit to a particular site or app, you want to have an idea of the type of workout you'll get so you can decide whether it would work for you and you would be likely to keep with it.Most virtual personal training providers have basic sample workouts that you can evaluate or try out for yourself. Keep in mind these won't necessarily be designed specifically for you, so they may not be directly representative of what you would be doing with your personal trainer if you became a member of the site.
Unless you find one and immediately know that it's the one you want, it's generally better to try out sample workouts (or trial memberships) from two or three different sites so you can compare and contrast to find the one you like the best.

, While it is normal for the site or your trainer to have recommendations, some sites are basically sales fronts for vitamin and nutrition supplements and services. If they continue to pressure you to buy things you don't want, you may not wish to work with that particular site or trainer.

, Even though virtual personal trainers are less expensive than live personal training, there's little point in spending the money unless your workouts are going to be designed just for you.The point of personal training is that you get a workout tailored to your needs, fitness level, and goals, rather than the one-size-fits-all approach taken by workout videos.
Personalized workouts also will be adapted to meet your needs and to reflect your personal progress and interests. A good virtual personal trainer will be responsive to your feedback and adjust your workout accordingly.
Ask trainers about how often they make those adjustments. While you may not particularly care to have them change up your workout on a daily basis, they probably should be adjusted at least weekly.

, The success of your relationship with a personal trainer — even a virtual personal trainer — depends on their overall approach to fitness and how they interact with you. A personal trainer should be someone who inspires and motivates you.Only you know what styles best suit you, and how you respond to various training styles. For example, if you respond best to a bootcamp-style, militant and pushy trainer, you don't want to get a virtual personal trainer who has a softer, gentler style.
Don't discount personality. If the trainer doesn't make you feel comfortable and motivated, they probably aren't going to work out for you any better virtually than they would in person. You're not going to be motivated to workout if your personal trainer is someone who gets on your nerves.
If possible, have several phone calls or video conferences with a trainer before you choose them. This enables you to communicate with them directly, hear their voice, and interact with them personally. You also might ask the trainer if you can watch videos they've created for other clients.

, Even though you may have already read a trainer's biography entry on the website or app where they work, there are benefits to hearing about it directly from them.Keep in mind that trainer bios on websites often are relatively short, and may not include everything about the trainer's background that would be relevant to you.
Come armed with specific questions, particularly if you have very specific goals or issues that you want to address. Determine what makes you different or unique, and ask the trainer how they respond to those differences and if they have any experience dealing with clients like you.
For example, if you have difficulty communicating and understanding nuance due to developmental delays or a mental disorder, a trainer's communication methods may be more important to you than anything else.

, An experienced trainer typically will have a roster of current and former clients who have indicated they are willing to provide a reference. Ask the trainer for names and contact information, if possible, so you can speak to these people directly.While a trainer may have collected written comments or references, it's generally better if you can talk to the person directly. You can ask questions that are relevant to you, as well as find out that person's background.
Even though someone may have had a wonderful experience with the trainer, their experience may not be relevant to you if they are drastically different from you, or if they have different fitness goals. For example, a positive reference from a middle-aged professional man may not carry much weight if you are a 20-year-old female college student.

, A personal trainer at a gym would ask detailed questions about your fitness background, health, and medical history. A virtual personal trainer should be no different.Typically you'll be given a lengthy questionnaire. It's important to be honest, even if the true answer to some of the questions embarrasses you. The trainer won't be able to customize your workouts appropriately unless they know as much information about you as possible.
If there is information about you that isn't revealed through the questions asked, but which you think is relevant to your training, be sure to include that information. For example, if you need steps to be written down because you have difficulty following oral instructions, you should make sure your trainer is aware of that.

, In many ways, a virtual personal training relationship is like any long-distance relationship. You need to put a lot more effort into communication if you want the relationship to be beneficial and long-lasting.Find out from your virtual personal trainer the best ways to communicate with them, and make sure you check in directly at least once a week. Let them know what aspects of the workout you enjoy, which things you find challenging, and if there's anything you dread or that you didn't enjoy.
Be honest about what you've been doing and when, especially if you're using taped sessions rather than working with your trainer in real time.
Include any other information that is relevant to your training and overall fitness. This may include personal issues or setbacks. For example, if you're a college student and have an important exam coming up that's stressing you out, this is something your virtual personal trainer needs to know so they can adjust your workouts accordingly.

, Your virtual personal trainer isn't going to know what's working for you and what isn't unless you tell them. Something that might be obvious if you were working out with them in the same room may not be apparent online.If there's a particular exercise that's giving you difficulty, explain your problem in detail. There may be an issue with your form or technique that needs to be corrected, but your virtual personal trainer cannot provide you that guidance unless they know there's a problem.
Let your virtual personal trainer know as soon as possible if there's a particular exercise that is painful for you, or that you had to stop due to pain or immense discomfort. This is something they will want to modify or adjust for immediately.

, When you're training with someone live in a gym, they are going to hold you accountable for showing up and putting in the effort. However, with virtual personal training you'll have more responsibility for that yourself.Using virtual personal training may require more discipline and self-motivation than using a live personal trainer at a gym. If you don't have the appropriate level of discipline, you won't get as much benefit from virtual personal training.
You're not going to be able to lean on your virtual personal trainer as much to keep you on track. You have to come into the relationship with a serious mindset and intent on improving your fitness.

Eating plenty of leafy greens like dandelion greens, spinach, kale, collard greens, mustard greens, broccoli, or Brussels sprouts will fill you up and nourish your body with vitamins A, C, K, and other essential nutrients.Eat a regular rotation of other vegetables like sweet potatoes, carrots, cauliflower, squash, green beans, cabbage, onions, and so on. Try to eat vegetables that are in season, which is when they are the most nutritious.
Start your day with a vegetable breakfast smoothie. Ditch pancakes and bacon and instead blend almond milk, a few handfuls of spinach or kale, and a kiwi or a banana for a powerful green smoothie to get your day started. Replace daily snacks with raw carrots, broccoli, or another vegetable smoothie.;
, Eating whole fruits is another great way to get the nutrients, water, and fiber your body needs to start looking more toned. Make sure to get several servings a day, choosing fruit that is in season in your area whenever possible.


Eat whole fruits like berries, bananas, apples, pears, oranges, melons, and so on instead of buying fruit juice.Eating fruit whole gives you the benefit of the fiber; without it, you end up consuming too much fructose, the type of sugar found in fruit.
Replace your typical desserts with fruit salad, or try making other healthy fruit based desserts. For a delicious, light take on ice cream, try this amazingly simple dish: freeze a banana solid, then put it in a food processor or blender and whip until it turns creamy. It will have the consistency of ice cream or custard.

, To achieve muscle tone, you'll need to feed your body with plenty of lean proteins. Protein can come from meat, but it is also found in vegetables, legumes and nuts.


Eat plenty of fish.Fish contain all the protein you need, as well as essential fatty acids that help make your body strong and lean.
Eat beans and tofu. If you're a vegetarian, try chickpeas, black beans, fava beans, and other legumes to get the protein you need. Tofu is also a healthy choice.
Eat red meat sparingly. Steak, hamburgers, bacon, and other beef and pork products are fine once in a while, but they should not make up the bulk of your daily means when you're trying to achieve a toned body.

, A balanced diet also includes healthy fats that promote organ and skin health as well as grains to give your body the fiber and minerals it needs.Choose whole grains like steel-cut oats, barley, buckwheat and quinoa rather than processed flours.
Nuts, avocados, olive oil, grapeseed oil, and other healthy oils are important supplements to a healthy diet.

, Drinking water helps your body flush away toxins and stay hydrated, both of which lead to a toned, healthy look. Try to drink 8 or more glasses a day, and more when you're exercising.


Avoid drinking too much alcohol. It causes your body to retain water and has other harmful effects that lead to bloating, rather than toning.
Choose water over soda, juice and milk. Pure water is calorie-free and healthier for your body than any other drink.

Raise your heart rate with cardio.The best exercise routine for toning your body is a combination of cardio, which gets your heart rate up and increases overall fitness, and weight training, which strengthens your muscles.,
Start resistance training.Cardio alone won't help your body get as toned as it can be.,
Do some yoga.",How to Tone Your Body2," Do cardio exercises three times a week, alternating between workouts like these:


Go power walking or running for 30 - 40 minutes. It's important to make sure your heart rate is raised the whole time. If you're breathing heavily and sweating, you're probably getting a good enough workout. You can buy a heart rate monitor to measure your heart rate and make sure it's properly elevated.
Try swimming, biking, hiking or playing a team sport. All of these exercises keep you moving for an extended period of time. Mixing things up will help you stay interested in exercising.

, Incorporating some resistance training will help you see results much faster. After a few weeks, the contours of your muscles will be defined, and you'll have more energy than ever.


Pay attention to all of the muscle groups. Do resistance training that focuses on your arms, back, shoulders, legs, and torso.
Try some basic body weight exercises, like lunges, push ups, chin ups, squats, sit ups, or burpees (also known as squat thrusts).

, Participating in a yoga class 2-3 times a week is one great way to get stronger and healthier. Yoga is good for building both flexibility and strength."

Ask your doctor about maintaining healthy liver and kidney function.,
Try fasting.,
Detox your mind.",How to Tone Your Body3," Your liverand kidneysare your body’s first line of defense against toxins. Talk to your doctor about what kinds of dietary and lifestyle changes you may need to make in order to keep your liver and kidneys in good condition, especially as you get older., No matter how healthy your diet may be, over time, environmental toxins can build up in your body and start causing health problems. Fasting is an excellent way to expel the toxins and cleanse your digestive system. This results in improved energy and tone.


Skipping the last meal of the day is an easy way to incorporate fasting into your life. Eat your last meal between 2 and 4 in the afternoon, then skip dinner to give your body a rest. The fasting period will last until breakfast the next morning.
Intermittent fasting is the practice of fasting for as long as 36 hours to completely cleanse the body. Consult your doctor first if you want to try this type of fast.Juice fasting is another popular type of fast. Again, you should consult your doctor before drastically altering your diet for an extended period of time.

, When you're stressed out, your body releases hormones that cause you to gain weight and look less toned.Do your best to reduce the stress in your life by taking the following measures:


Get plenty of sleep. Your body and mind need time to recuperate after your busy days. Lack of sleep has been shown to lead to weight gain.
Slow down. Trying to cram in workout sessions around a packed schedule makes it more difficult to achieve the tone you desire. If possible, ramp down your activities so you have more time to focus on your health.
Spend time outside. Instead of relaxing in front of the TV, take a walk and get some fresh air. Being outside is better for your mind and body than watching TV."

Consider monitors to track speed or distance.,
Use a target heart rate monitor.,
Consider a multi-tool fitness monitor.,
Decide whether a calorie monitor is essential.,
Determine the level of precision you need.",How to Use Fitness Monitors1," If you walk, run, bike, hike, or swim, monitors that track speed and distance can help you monitor improvements in endurance, timing, and agility.


These monitors can be especially useful for people exercising outdoors with no track, trying to increase the number of steps they take each day, or those biking or swimming with no distance markers.
Some specialty shoes accommodate a computer chip “App” that can be programmed to track speed, distance, and duration and then charted in a computer program to display your progress over time.;
, This is particularly essential if you have a heart condition or other health problem that requires close monitoring of your vital signs.


Target heart rate monitoring is also very useful for ensuring that you exercise within the optimum heart rate range for burning calories and improving cardiovascular health.

, Certain watches or wrist monitors track the time of your workouts, the distance you walk or run, your pulse (with an audio warning if target heart rate is exceeded), and other useful data. If you perform a variety of activities or if you wish to have the information provided by a multi-tool monitor, a single device may be useful for you.

, Although devices that estimate the number of calories you burn may be appealing, they are often inaccurate unless adjusted closely for your current fitness level, age, and other health indicators.


Calorie burn monitors may be useful if you have a general idea of the target number of calories you would like to burn at each session, but they should not be considered extremely reliable if factors such as BMI, resting heart rate, and other in-depth indicators are not taken into account in the calculation.

, Consider the importance of accurate measures to your fitness routine and health, particularly for monitoring time, distance, speed, and heart rate.


If you are simply trying to reach 10,000 steps each day, the level of precision in your pedometer will be different than if you are training for a race or another competitive event. While even low-cost monitors often track time and number of steps with good precision, more expensive monitors may be necessary for accurate speed and heart rate monitoring.

Increase your baseline activity.,
Include two to three days of strength training weekly.,

Take a rest day or two.,
Stretch.",How to Train Your Body," Anytime you want to start a new training or exercise program, it'll be a smart idea to see a doctor first. He will be able to tell you whether or not your plan is safe and appropriate for you.


Make an appointment or call your doctor. Tell him about what your goals are and your exercise plan to help you reach them.
Also tell him whether or not you're having any joint or muscular pain in addition to having any pain or shortness of breath.
Also consider seeing a personal trainer. This is a fitness professional that will be able to help you set goals, design a plan to meet them and teach you how to do a variety of exercises safely.;
, Training your body is a fairly broad goal. To increase your chances of meeting your goal, you should work to make a more specific goal. Try using the S.M.A.R.T. goal system. Goals that are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time-Based have a higher chance of being an appropriate and reachable goal for you.In addition, add in information about how you're going to reach your goal.
Spend some time thinking about what you want to train. Do you want to just get in better overall shape? Are you training for a race? Do you want to build more strength or lean muscle? Do you want to lose some weight? How much? By when?
An example of a good goal would be: I want to run a 10 mile race in five months. I will run three to four days a week and increase my mileage by one mile every two weeks until I reach 10 miles.

, Regardless of what you're training for or what you've set for yourself, tracking your progress in a journal may be a motivating part of your plan.Write out your goals and your plan in your journal. This may help keep you focused and track.In addition track your progress each day or week. If you're training for that 10 mile (16.1 km) race, maybe you write down how many miles you ran each week and how easy or hard it's been.
You can also keep a little calendar or chart of where you plan your exercise of the week or month.

, Some training plans may need a gym or specialized equipment to meet. Not all physical activity will need this, but you may want to consider what equipment you need to best meet your goal.


Consider joining a gym. Many memberships are as low as $10 a month. Gyms offer you the ability to do most exercises inside. You can do a variety of cardio, strength training and even take classes. Even if you may not need the equipment at the gym, it might be nice to have the option to workout inside if it's a rainy or cold day.
If you're not a fan of the gym, maybe you could consider purchasing some at-home gym equipment. You can start small with just a few items like hand weights or resistance bands or buy more expensive equipment like cardio machines or home gym machines.

, The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend getting at least 150 minutes or about 2 1/2 hours of cardio activities each week for the minimum amount of health benefits.This breaks down to just five 30-minute sessions a week.


Studies have shown that when people participate in 150 minutes of physical activity, they see a variety of health benefits including: decreased risk of diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease, weight loss, improved sleep and mood habits and even improved circulation.The types of cardio activities that you can include for this 150 minutes can be anything from walking, running, biking, or doing a kickboxing class. However, the activity you do during the day (baseline or lifestyle activity) does not count towards your 150 minutes.
If you're just starting out with physical activity, one of your first goals may be to meet this general recommendation.

, There are two main types of cardio exercises — steady-state and interval exercises. Both offer a variety of benefits, so try to incorporate both into your workout.


Steady-state cardio are the activities that you do for at least 10 minutes and are maintaining your intensity. The goal is that you maintain a steady heart rate during your activity.For example, jogging for 20 minutes or using the elliptical at a steady speed for 30 minutes counts as steady-state cardio.
Some of the specific benefits of steady-state cardio are: improved and faster recovery, maintenance of lean muscle mass, significant increases in cardiovascular and aerobic fitness levels, and immediate decreases in blood pressure and blood sugar.HIIT or high intensity interval training is another type of exercise that has become more popular lately. It's a shorter workout in total and combines both short bouts of very, very high intensity exercises with periods of more moderate exercises.The benefits of HIIT differ slightly than steady-state cardio and can include: a more efficient and faster workout, increased ability to burn calories from fat and increased metabolism for eight to 24 hours after you've completed the workout.Regardless of which type of exercise you choose to do predominantly, it's better to do a combination of both HIIT and steady-state as you can reap the benefits of both., Although baseline doesn't come with as many benefits of steady-state or HIIT types of workouts, it's still an important part of being active.


Baseline activity or lifestyle activities are things that you do on a typical day — walking to and from your car or doing household chores.
These activities do not burn many calories by themselves or increase your heart rate, but when you increase them as much as you can, over the entire day they do burn some calories and can help support your fitness levels.
Increasing your baseline makes your body function more efficiently in day-to-day activities (which burns more calories with less work).
Think about ways that you can be more active or include more movement in your day. You could: park farther away, take the stairs instead of the elevator, take short walk breaks during your lunch break and stand or do light exercises during commercial breaks.

, In addition to cardio, the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans also recommends that you include about two to three days of strength training or weight-bearing exercises each week.Strength and resistance training offers you different benefits compared to aerobic or cardio exercises, such as: it protects bones and helps prevent osteoporosis, maintains and can increase lean muscle mass, increase your overall metabolism, improves balance and coordination, and boosts energy levels.Weight training exercises can include a variety of activities including: plyometric exercises or body weight exercises, free weights, using weight machines, or doing yoga or pilates.

, When it comes to weight lifting or resistance training there are two basic types of exercises — compound and isolation exercises. Both offer different benefits and which one you choose will depend on your overall goal.


Compound exercises are activities that recruit multiple joints and multiple muscle groups in order to perform.Examples of compound exercises include: barbell bench press, squats and lunges.
The benefits of compound exercises include: reduced risk of overtraining, less time spent overall exercising, increased gains in muscle mass, and increased gains in strength.Isolation exercises are those that only target one small group of muscles or use weight machines to target only one muscle group. Examples include using the bicep curl machine or seated tricep extensions.
For most training goals (even from basic to more advanced), spending more time with compound exercises is your best bet. Isolation exercises are best for fine tweaking once you have already met your goals.

, In addition to choosing compound or isolation exercises, you'll also need to decide whether or not you want to do higher reps with a low weight or lower reps with a higher weight.


Higher reps usually results in bigger gains in muscle mass, not strength. If you're goal is to build mass, include exercises that have higher reps.Lower reps with much higher weights results in significant strength gains, not necessarily increased muscle mass.It's best to do a combination of both high and low rep exercises. However, tailor this depending on what you're goal is (bigger muscles or increased strength).

, Before any type of workout, it's essential to warm up appropriately beforehand. Try to include even a short warm up before you exercise for the safest workout.


Warm-up exercises don't have to be anything specific. It's generally recommended to do a warm-up routine for at least five to 10 minutes. However, the longer you plan on working out, the longer your warm-up routine should be.The goal of warm-ups includes: slowly dilates your blood vessels in your muscle to help increase blood and oxygen flow, raises the temperature of your muscles for the best flexibility and efficiency, and it also slowly raises your heart rate which decreases the overall stress on your heart.Warm-ups are typically a slower version of whatever activity you plan on doing. For example, if you're planning on going for a run, walk for five to 10 minutes first.

, Although it may seem counterintuitive, taking adequate rest days is just as important as the actual exercise. Without proper rest days, it'll be hard to meet any training goal.


In regards to strength training, rest days are actually when your muscles grow in size and strength.If you do not take rest days, overtime, you will have poor performance and poor results.On your rest days, try to still include light-intensity activity. You don't necessarily want to lounge around all day without doing anything. Ideally do some walking or restorative yoga.

, A combination of adequate rest, warming up and stretching will put your body in the best condition for exercise and great results.Stretching has been shown to help reduce muscle stiffness and pain when done appropriately. In addition, it can also help improve flexibility over timeOther benefits of regular stretching include: better posture, increased blood flow, prevent back and neck pain, and improve balance.You can do a slow stretching routine with moves like toe touches or you can take a restorative and stretching class like yoga.

Set the monitor for your age, weight, and other indicators.,
Place the monitor in the appropriate area.,
Check the results on the monitor frequently.",How to Use Fitness Monitors2," Most fitness monitors track motions and vital signs differently depending on certain health factors. Enter as much information as suggested in the device’s instructions to get the most accurate readings.

, Take note of the proper position or location for the monitor. If monitors are placed in an incorrect spot on the body, they may give inaccurate readings.


Some pedometers require placement at the front of the waist, while others can be worn on the hip, back, shoe, or wrist.
Some heart rate monitors must be wrapped around the wrist, while others can be held in the palm or strapped to the chest.
If the monitor is built into a machine you are using, make sure you are able to comfortably use it prior to exercising; in some cases, the height of the handlebars or the orientation of the heart monitor can be changed to allow easier access.

, This is particularly important the first few times you use the monitor. Checking pedometers and heart rate monitors for accuracy is essential to ensure that you can rely on the values reported by the machine.


Some monitors may need to be re-calibrated depending on any changes in the desired purpose (to monitor walking instead of running), a change in fitness level (to accommodate a new target heart rate or new weight), or the amount of time you have been using them.

"
"
Use the monitor every time you exercise.,
Record the readings at the end of each session.",How to Use Fitness Monitors3," Regular use of the monitor is essential to achieving the benefits of a fitness monitor, particularly if you need to closely monitor your heart rate.


Keep the monitor in a visible location, such as your shoes or workout bag, so that you will not forget to use it when you exercise.
Wearing the monitor consistently allows you to track your improvements in speed, distance, time, and average heart rate, which can be vital to identifying areas of progress or potential areas for improvement.

, Unless your monitor keeps a record of your readings, write down relevant measurements after each session in a fitness journal.


Consider tracking information such as time spent at target heart rate, number of minutes spent exercising, total distance, number of minutes spent running instead of walking, and any other factors that are relevant to your fitness routine.
Having a written record of your measurements will alert you to warning signs, such as too many sessions in which you exceed your target heart rate or too few sessions in which you reach your goal of 10 miles (16 km). It can also demonstrate that you have improved by indicating a steady increase in total distance or even demonstrating that your speed for an uphill climb has risen.

Get an expert to observe your workout.,
Focus on your patterns of movement.,
Tweak your form.,
Monitor your heart rate.",How to Troubleshoot Your Workout1," If you've reached a plateau, a personal trainer may be able to help you take your workout to the next level. They can point out flaws in your technique and give you tips to get more out of your exercises.A personal trainer may ask you questions to get a sense of your diet, life activities, and other factors that might be impacting your workout.
Answer these questions honestly – don't try to impress the personal trainer with how healthy and active you are, or you won't get the help you need.
If you decide not to enlist a personal trainer (or can't afford one), try working out in front of a mirror.
Watch videos of people doing the exercises correctly, then compare what you saw to what you see in the mirror.;
, Most mistakes in technique happen while your body is in motion. You may have gotten into a movement pattern because it was initially easier, but now it's caused your exercises to have diminished benefit.This can be particularly important if you're doing a series of exercises. Watch your movement when you're transitioning from one exercise to the next.
Since transitions tend to be ""unscripted,"" in the sense that you don't have to do them in a specific way, or using a particular form, you may inadvertently be doing something that's causing stress or pain.
For example, when moving from squats to lunges, you may be inadvertently placing too much weight on your knees or ankles, which can stress your tendons and cause pain.
Likewise, looking in the mirror can show you which muscles are doing the work, as you'll see them bulging or moving. If the wrong muscles are working, you may be doing the exercise incorrectly.
If certain movements are causing you pain, stop them immediately until you've identified the cause of the pain.

, Sometimes, problems develop simply because you've slipped into a minor lapse of form that causes your muscles to work differently. Making the adjustment back to correct form can make a tremendous improvement.If errors in form are the problem, you should notice a difference immediately. The exercise should feel different and any pain you're having should stop.
For example, when you do sit-ups or crunches, you are supposed to be working your abdominal muscles – not lifting from the neck. If you feel like you are straining in your neck or shoulders, make an adjustment and focus on your abdominals.
Your posture may be an issue with some exercises, such as squats. If you're feeling back or shoulder pain, you may be hunching your shoulders or leaning forward as you do the exercise.
If the exercise continues to feel painful, or you continue to have excess fatigue or other issues, the cause is something other than poor form.

, Monitoring your heart rate is a good way to measure the impact your exercise is having on your body. Pay attention to the signals your body is sending to you and adjust your workout as necessary.Check your heart rate first thing in the morning so you have a base reading to work from.
If your heart rate is between 7 and 10 beats per minute faster than your base reading, your workout is causing you excess fatigue.
Take a break for a day or two and look at other factors in your life that may be contributing to your fatigue.
When you return to your routine, start slower and work your way back up to more intense levels.

Combine conditioning and cardio.,
Take on a different activity.,
Map a different route.,
Alternate high and low intensity.,
Go for a change of scenery.",How to Troubleshoot Your Workout2," If you've gotten bored doing planks and sit-ups, try a full-body workout like swimming or kickboxing. These exercises strengthen and condition your muscles while also giving you a good cardiovascular workout.These types of workouts also add an element of competition that can give you additional motivation and jumpstart your old workout into something you find exciting again.
Kickboxing and similar activities also reduce stress, which can help you shed unwanted pounds.
If you have heart or blood pressure problems, consult your doctor before you decide to take on any intense full-body workout.

, Adding a new activity can shake up a boring routine as well as give you the opportunity to meet some new people and learn new skills. Think outside the box – or gym – and consider activities that may not traditionally be considered ""exercise.""For example, you might consider taking a dance class. Fast, intense dance styles such as swing can burn as much as 350 calories an hour.
Dancing also can improve your balance and general coordination, and may even boost your mood and lower your anxiety levels.
If you're an expert in a sport, contact a local school or community center and find out if you can volunteer to coach a kids' team. You can have a positive impact on your community and get exercise at the same time.

, If your standard workout consists of a few stretches followed by a jog around your neighborhood, check the map application on your phone and come up with a different route that covers roughly the same distance.For some people, seeing the same people, places, and things every day is comforting. For others, it gets boring and you can easily find yourself in a rut.
You may not even have to run in a completely different area. If you run a loop, just run it backwards.

, Your body needs time to recover after an intense workout. If you've noticed that you feel exhausted and lack motivation, or if you're constantly looking for excuses to skip your workout or quit early, you may have recovery problems.Think of recovery as similar to sleep. You can have a recovery deficit if you engage in too many fast, high-impact workouts day after day.
This is similar to the sleep deficit you accrue if you try to get by for several days in a row with only a few hours of sleep each night.
Both recovery deficit and sleep deficit are similar in that they can leave you exhausted and sore and sap your motivation.
Doing a slow, gentle, low-impact workout such as yoga in between more intense sessions such as an exercise boot camp can give your body the time it needs.

, If you're bored and have come to dread your workouts, it may be that all you need to do is move your routine to a different location. Particularly if you're always at home or in the gym, going outside can do wonders to reinvigorate your motivation.Working out at a different time can shake things up for you as well and get you out of a rut. This can be particularly helpful if you feel tired before starting your workout.
If you're a member of a chain gym, you might try going to a different location in another part of town.
Seeing different people and even taking a different route to the gym can make it seem new – even if once you get there you're still doing the exact same exercise routine.
Scenery doesn't just apply to what you see around you. If you normally listen to music while you workout, consider swapping out your usual tunes with a different playlist.

"
Evaluate your recovery protocol.,
Get adequate rest.,
Inventory your life.,
Take a break.,
Review your diet.",How to Troubleshoot Your Workout3," Often if you have a ""go hard or go home"" sort of mentality, you may find that you're not giving your body enough time to recover between intense workouts, or that you're not taking that recovery time seriously.Ample rest and relaxation should be part of your recovery protocol, along with insuring that you're eating enough to replenish lost nutrients and help your immune system recover.
At a minimum, you want to allow at least 24 hours for recovery between workouts. For particularly intense or strenuous workouts, you may need to double that time. You can always do a more gentle, low-impact routine in between to keep yourself active.
Keep in mind that it's during recovery that your results really happen – be they weight loss, increased strength, or greater balance and flexibility.
When you workout, you damage your muscles and put your body to the test. During recovery, it rebuilds stronger, with greater endurance for the next intense workout.

, Burning the midnight oil to get a big project for work completed under deadline drains your energy and can impact your workout even days later. If you're not consistently getting around eight hours of sleep a night, your workout may suffer.In this case, there's no problem with the workout itself. Rather, your issues are related to the fact that you're not getting enough sleep.
When you're already tired, any additional stress you put your body through is going to cause more damage than it normally would.
For this reason, working out when you haven't had enough sleep can put too much strain on your body and cause injuries.

, Often, troubleshooting your workout really comes down to troubleshooting your life. Stressful events, change, and uncertainty elsewhere in your life can manifest themselves in a frustrating workout experience.It can help to sit down and write out what you do every day – or keep a schedule diary for a few days. This can help you see what you're really doing and what stresses you the most.
Pay attention to how you feel during the day, and what seems to cause dips in energy. See what you can change to remedy that problem.
If you're going through a stressful short-term event – maybe you're transitioning to a new position at work or moving to a new house – consider putting your workouts on hold until the stressful situation has passed.

, Particularly if you have a lot going on in your life, or if you can't pinpoint exactly what's going on with your workout, putting your routine on pause often is your best option. Give yourself a chance to fully recover and start back in slowly.Taking a break is especially important if your workout is causing you pain or discomfort.
Keep in mind that pain is a signal from your body that something is wrong. If your body is injured, it needs a chance to mend.
Continuing to work out with a minor injury can turn it into a more serious one – particularly if you don't have expert supervision.

, In many cases, something you're eating – or not eating – may be to blame when you start having issues with your workout routine. This is the case whether you've noticed physical problems or just feel tired and bored with your usual exercises.If you haven't done it in awhile (or ever), keep a food diary for a week or so. Write down everything you eat, including approximate amounts, and when.
Look at your food diary and see if you notice any patterns that could be impacting your workouts.
You may want to bring the issue up with a nutritionist or a personal trainer if nothing jumps out at you as the culprit.
If you think you may have particular food sensitivities, such as a sensitivity to gluten, try cutting it out of your diet for a week and see how you feel. During that week, it's important not to change anything else so you know that any changes are due to not eating that substance.

Add strength training to your current exercise regime.,
Drink more water throughout the day.,
Consume a higher amount of healthy, whole foods high in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.,
Exfoliate your skin daily to help increase skin circulation and encourage the growth of new skin cells.,
Moisturize your skin daily to improve hydration and boost collagen and elastin production.,
Stop exposing your skin to harsh soaps, detergents, and chlorinated water.,
Have your skin massaged once per week or biweekly.,
Limit your skin’s exposure to the sun and tanning beds.,
Consult with your healthcare provider about the possibility of undergoing surgical or non-surgical skin tightening treatments or body contouring procedures.",How to Tighten Skin After Weight Loss," Strength and resistance training exercises will help tighten and tone the muscles underneath your skin, lending to an overall tighter physical appearance. Do strength training exercises at least two to three times per week that target all major muscle groups, including stubborn areas with loose skin. For example, if the majority of your loose, excess skin lies in your abdominal region, focus on doing strength training exercises that strengthen your core and tighten your abs.;
, Water will help keep your body hydrated and naturally improve the elasticity of your skin. Aim to drink at least 0.5 gallons (2 liters) of water per day or more as needed based on your environment and activity level. For example, those who spend more time outdoors in warmer temperatures may need to consume more than the daily recommended amount of water.


Swap out sodas, sugary fruit drinks, energy drinks, coffee, and alcohol for water as much as possible. These types of beverages contain high amounts of sugar, caffeine, additives, and other compounds that can result in further dehydration and worsen the elasticity of your skin.

, Healthy whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, sources of lean protein, nuts, seeds, and legumes contain vitamins and antioxidants that support and boost your body’s production of elastin and collagen, and are crucial to maintaining tight, healthy skin. Lower your intake of processed foods and foods high in sugar and fat, and consume more healthy, whole foods to help tighten loose skin., Exfoliating will help eliminate dead and unhealthy skin cells, and promote the growth of new, healthy skin cells that contain ample amounts of elastin and collagen. Use mineral and sea salt scrubs all over your body or on areas with loose skin daily to gradually tighten your skin., Moisturizing skin care products that contain ingredients such as aloe vera, hyaluronic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, and vitamin A will naturally help hydrate and boost your skin’s production of collagen and elastin.

, The ingredients and compounds found in many harsh beauty and household formulas can dehydrate your skin and worsen your skin’s elastin and collagen. Start using gentle, mild soaps and all-natural detergents that lack harsh chemicals, and purchase a water filter for your showerhead to filter out harmful substances that can damage your skin., A skin massage will naturally help improve your skin’s circulation, which, in turn, can help boost collagen and elastin production. Make an appointment with a professional massage therapist and explain that your goal is to tighten loose skin. Your massage specialist may even use natural oils and compounds that can help accelerate the tightening of loose skin.

, Exposing your skin to UV rays from the sun or tanning salons can lead to further skin cell damage, as well as affect your skin’s production of collagen and elastin. Stop visiting the tanning salon, and cover your skin with pants and long sleeves when spending time outdoors to prevent sunburn and excess sun exposure., Cosmetic surgery procedures such as abdominoplasty (tummy tuck surgery), body lift surgery, and brachioplasty (arm lift surgery) can help remove or tighten stubborn pockets of loose skin following weight loss. Talk to your doctor about whether these treatments can help tighten loose skin if diet and exercise fail to work for you."

Be aware that you should do exercises that increase your stability, mobility and strength.,
Stop doing the exercise if you feel pain.,
Wait to start doing exercises until your doctor says it's ok.,
Work with a physical therapist to determine which exercises fit your specific injury.",How to Treat a High Ankle Sprain with Exercises1," If you are dealing with a high ankle sprain, you may have noticed that your ability to get around and keep your balance has been impaired. Exercising can help your to regain the normal function of your ankle. You must regain your stability before you work on mobility or strength.Stability training: Stability is your ability to stand on your injured ankle without feeling off balance or tipping over.
Mobility training: This is your ability to move your ankle around in every direction that it normally goes in when it is not injured. When you are fully mobile, your ankle is less likely to become stiff or have scar tissue develop.
Strength training: When you injure your ankle and can’t walk on it, the muscles around your ankle also get weak. You need to make them strong again in order to make a full recovery.;
, Try not to push yourself too hard when doing these exercises or you could end up injuring your ankle further. While a little discomfort is normal when you start doing exercises after suffering a sprain, you should not feel serious pain in your ankle.If you do start feeling a sharp or extreme pain, stop the exercise immediately and ice your ankle. You should also elevate it to reduce swelling that might occur because of the exercise.

, The time you have to wait before you can begin exercises will depend on how serious your sprain was. Do not start doing exercises without talking to your doctor. Pushing yourself to do exercises before you are ready could result in injuring yourself further. Moderate high ankle sprains will generally make you unable to put weight on your ankle for one or two weeks. When you can start putting weight on it again, talk to your doctor and start doing exercises.If you had surgery to repair a very severe high ankle sprain, you will most likely have to wait longer than one or two weeks before you begin rehabilitation. Follow the time frame that your doctor gives you.

, Like talking to your doctor about when to start exercising, talking to a physical therapist about the specific exercises you do is also a good idea. Each injury is different, so your physical therapist might recommend some exercises over others.


The following sections cover basic exercises that are often recommended for high ankle sprains.

"
"
Try single leg stand to increase your stability.,
Increase your stability with a standing calf raise .,
Practice writing the alphabet with your toes to increase mobility once you can do a single leg stand comfortably.,
Increase your mobility with the windshield wiper.,
Do eversion and inversion exercises for both stability and mobility.,
Use an elastic band to do eversion and inversion exercises.,
Add some challenges to the single leg stand once you can do it comfortably.",How to Treat a High Ankle Sprain with Exercises2," The single leg stand is done by standing with one arm placed on a table or any support you can find. Carefully shift the weight of your body to the injured foot and then hold it there for 15 seconds if you can. If you can’t, just stand on your injured ankle for as long as you can—it will get easier with time and practice.


As you progresses, try to stand on your injured foot for 45 seconds. Do two sets of this exercise with 10 to 15 repetitions, two or three times a day.
To make the leg stand as hard as possible, close your eyes while standing on a cushion.

, The standing calf raise is done by standing up straight and then lifting your uninjured foot partially off the floor. Your injured foot should have its heel lifted but your toes should remain on the floor, as if you were wearing high heels. Try not to hold on to anything while you do this to increase your stability.


Do two sets of 10 or 15 reps, two to three times a day.

, Sit in a chair and raise your injured ankle up so that it is out in front of you. Pretend that your big toe (or even your whole food) is a pen. Write the alphabet in the air, keeping in mind that your ankle will most likely feel pretty stiff in the beginning—it will get easier with time and practice.


Once you have written the alphabet, try to write the alphabet backwards.

, The windshield wiper is done by sitting on a chair with your foot flat on the floor facing straight. Move your injured foot carefully inward then outward. Your foot and ankle should reflect the way a windshield wiper moves back and forth across a window. Do two sets of 10 to 15 reps, 2 to 3 times a day.

, Eversion refers to turning or moving your foot outward, while inversion means turning your foot in towards your body. You can do the eversion and inversion exercise by standing next to a leg table or door jamb. When doing the eversion, you push against the table leg or door jam with your foot and ankle. To do the inversion, put your foot on the other side of the table leg or door jam and pull it towards you.Hold each push or pull for 2 to 3 seconds. Do two sets of 10 to 15 repetitions, two or three times a day.

, You can also do eversion and inversion exercises with an elastic band. The same principle is applied. You loop the elastic band on your foot while the other end is tied on a heavy object. When doing the eversion, turn your foot away from your body. When doing the inversion, turn your foot towards the center of your body.


Do two sets of 10 to 15 reps, two or three times day.

, If you have done this exercise and found it to be easy, make it harder by adding some more challenges. Stand on a folded up towel or cushion because both of these things create an unstable surface that you have to work hard to stand still on.


You can also make the single leg stand harder by closing your eyes. When you don’t have a point of reference to look at, you may find that it is harder to keep your balance.
You can also do this exercise as a sitting calf raise. Sit on a chair with your foot flat on the floor. Slowly lift your heel up while keeping your toes on the ground.

Try towel curls.,
Strengthen your muscles with a towel press.,
Stretch your calves out.,
Practice lateral steps.,
Do lateral hops after you have mastered the lateral step.",How to Treat a High Ankle Sprain with Exercises3," Towel curls target the muscles in your shin. To do this, you will need to ask a friend or family member for assistance. Sit on the ground with your legs stretched out in front of you. Place a towel over your injured ankle and foot. Have your friend hook the towel around your foot and pull the towel away from your body. This will pull your foot away from your body. At the same time, try to resist the pull by curling your foot towards you.Hold this position for 15 seconds. After the time is up, rest for 30 seconds and then repeat the exercise three more times. Stop doing the exercise if you start to feel pain.

, The towel press exercise targets your calves. It is essentially the opposite of the towel curl. Sit with your legs stretched out in front of you. Wrap a towel across the center of the sole of your foot and take both ends of the towel in each of your hands. Pull the edges of the towel towards you. Resist the pull by pushing your foot against the towel, away from your body.


Hold this position for 15 seconds. After the time is up, rest for 30 seconds and then repeat the exercise three more times. Stop doing the exercise if you start to feel pain.
If you have a yoga or exercise strap, you can use this instead of a towel.

, You can do a calf stretch by placing your injured foot behind the uninjured foot. Stand near a wall so that you can use it for support. Lean forward and push against the wall in such a way that you feel the calf muscle of your injured ankle stretching. You should not feel any pain when doing this exercise—if you do, stop.


Hold this position for 30 seconds and do two sets of 10 to 15 repetitions, 2-3 times a day.

, The lateral step is done by placing a rolled towel on the floor. Stand on the right side of the rolled towel and lift your left leg over the towel. Place it down on the opposite side of the towel. Bring your right leg and the rest of your body to the right side of the rolled towel. Return to the other side of the towel by doing the same steps with the left side of your body.Increase your speed if you can do this without feeling pain. Do two sets of 10 to 15 repetitions, two or three times a day.

, The lateral hop is done by placing a rolled towel on the floor. Stand at the right side of the rolled towel, then hop over it, landing on your left foot. Hop again on the opposite side, this time landing on your right foot.Gradually increase your speed and the height of your hop depending on the pain you feel. Do this two or three times a day with two sets of 10 to 15 hops each.

Set the timer.,
Get up from the computer and take a quick walk.,
Play a quick game of something like Pac-Man that can allow you to play it very quickly.,
Get something to drink.,
Check to make sure you have the proper supplies that you need for your next project before you start again so that you can't use that as an excuse.

,
Listen to an upbeat song while you're on break, or read some fan fiction.

,
Schedule breaks frequently.

",How to Take a Quick Break," If you're in the middle of a project, set it for about ten or fifteen minutes every hour. Set a timer so you don't get distracted. When you are done setting the timer, mentally repeat to yourself what time you will be done with your break.;
, It could be to the bathroom, out the door, or to the nearest soda machine. Walking will help you get the energy that you need while allowing you to simply enjoy.

, Sometimes, focusing your brain on something different is enough to get a good break.

, Avoid caffeine and alcohol, as these can make your nerves jittery. Instead, focus on something that is caffeine free. Limit sugar. If you're hungry, get something to eat.

Increase your treadmill's incline.,
Invest in outdoor running shoes.,
Start with one outdoor run a week.,
Split your runs.,
Increase outdoor runs gradually.,
Strengthen your hamstrings and quads.,
Shorten your stride.,
Slow your pace.,
Condition yourself with walk breaks.,
Dress for the conditions.,
Maintain your focus.,
Keep tabs on your intensity.,
Start with shorter routes.,
Run on a trail rather than the road.,
Stay close to where you started.,
Download an app.",How to Switch from Treadmill Running to Outdoor Running," Your treadmill is completely flat, while most outdoor running surfaces are not. To help prepare your body for the difference, you can practice by running on an incline on your treadmill.An incline of 1-2% closely simulates running outdoors.
Program your treadmill so that it adjusts incline throughout your run, if the treadmill you use has this feature available.;
, Since a treadmill's surface is smooth and cushioned, you may not have given much thought to your running shoes. However, you need a quality pair of running shoes with grippy soles capable of navigating uneven terrain. Choose a pair specifically for pavement or trail running, depending on what you plan to do.Pay attention to the cushioning and shock absorption available as well as the soles.
If you've never bought a pair of outdoor running shoes before, it is recommended that you go to a running specialty store and get a knowledgeable associate to assist you.
An associate can observe your running style and help you choose shoes based on whether you are a pronator (meaning you roll the foot inward) or a heel striker (you strike the ground first with the heel), or if have weak ankles or other issues.

, If you ran outdoors in the past, you can probably make the switch from treadmill running fairly quickly. However, after running on a treadmill for an extended period of time, you need to give your body time to adjust.If you've never run outside before, start with a short outdoor run every other week instead of every week. Try this for a month, then increase to twice a week.

, You don't necessarily have to do an entire run either outdoors or indoors. One way to increase the amount of time you run outdoors gradually is to do a small portion of your run outdoors and the rest of it on your treadmill.For example, if you run 5 miles (8.0 km) a day, you could do a quarter of that distance outside, and the rest of it inside. Gradually increase the distance that you run outside.
Keep track of your time. Your pace will be different outside than it will be on a treadmill.

, If you want to switch totally from treadmill running to outdoor running, it may take you a couple of months. Keep this in mind if you want to start running outdoors because of a change in the weather.For example, if you run indoors during cold months and outdoors during warm months, anticipate when it's going to start to get warmer. Find the warmest day on any given week and run outside for a little while. That way you can get the most out of the warm weather.

, Outdoor running places greater demands on your hamstrings and quads than treadmill running. When running on a treadmill, you get assistance from the motor so your muscles don't work as hard.Look for dynamic stretches and exercises, such as squats and lunges, that focus on strengthening these muscle groups.
Start these exercises before you start making your transition to outdoor running to help reduce your risk of injury as you transition to running outside.
Make sure you cool down and stretch thoroughly after running outside, keeping in mind that your hamstrings and quads are getting worked more than they usually are when you run on the treadmill.

, When switching from treadmill to outdoor running, you may want to shorten the length of your stride. This will give you a more stable base while you adapt to uneven terrain. Once you are used to running outside, you can lengthen your stride., There are variables outside, such as wind, humidity, temperature, that will affect your pace. These variables combined with the uneven terrain may mean that you cannot run as fast outside as you can indoors on a treadmill.You'll fare better if you don't try to run at the same pace outside as you did on the treadmill. Pay attention to your breathing and your heart rate, as well as how your muscles feel.
Don't get discouraged if you feel your outdoor running performance is poor compared to your treadmill running performance. Once you get adjusted to outdoor running, your pace will improve.

, When you run on a treadmill, your pace is regulated by the motor in the treadmill. If you were able to program intervals, you may already have experience walking and then running, but when outdoors you have to regulate your own pace.Walk breaks can help strengthen your leg muscles as well as get your feet used to the uneven terrain.
A walk break also is helpful if you encounter an incline much steeper than anything you've ever attempted on a treadmill.

, When you run on a treadmill in a climate-controlled space, you don't have to give much thought to your attire. However, when running outdoors, you may have to buy new running gear to protect yourself from the elements.Choose lightweight layers so you can take something off if you get overheated during your run. If you have exposed skin, make sure you wear sunscreen.
Wear a hat or visor to shield your eyes from the sun and also keep your hair out of your face.
Secure identification, cash or a card, and other essentials on your person. Items shaking in your pockets as you run will be distracting, and could fall out.

, When you ran on a treadmill, you may have passed your time by zoning out on the television, or listening to an audio book or podcast. While you can listen to music or another audio recording while you run outside, you still need to remain alert.Not only do you need to keep an eye on the terrain so you don't trip on anything, you also need to watch for other runners, cyclists, and pedestrians, as well as cars if you're running alongside a road.
On your first few outdoor runs, it's best to minimize distractions so you can focus on your route and your running. Pay attention to your body and notice the differences between outdoor running and treadmill running.

, While running on a treadmill, you may have measured your peak performance based on the speed at which you were going. When running outdoors, pay attention to how you feel and how hard you're breathing.Use a heart rate monitor to keep track of the intensity of your workout.
The workout your body gets is reflected by the length of time you work at a certain level of intensity – not by how far you go during that time.
Looking at the level of intensity of your effort rather than how far you go also takes into account other variables outdoors, such as wind resistance, which can affect your pacing.

, Because outdoor running places more demands on your body than treadmill running, you don't want to go too far too fast. You can begin with a 1-mile (1.6-km) route, and repeat it once you are more comfortable running outside. Work up to longer routes, such as 3 miles (4.8 km)., Treadmills are cushioned and absorb some of the shock of the impact of your feet on the surface. Roads are not this forgiving. Trails composed of dirt or gravel give you a softer surface.Look for running trails in nearby parks. If you're running on a trail, especially at night, you might want to find a buddy to run with you – even if the trail is relatively well lit.
It might help to walk through the trail before you run it, especially if you've never seen it before, so you know what to expect.

, Especially if you're just starting to make the transition from treadmill running to outdoor running, try to plan circular routes. If you simply go in one direction, you might find yourself unable to get back due to injury or fatigue.When running outdoors, expect to get tired more quickly. Map a route in which you maintain a relatively short distance from the place where you started.

, There are a number of apps available for smartphones that you can use for your outdoor running program. Many include GPS tracking and other tools to help you map your route and track your progress.Since many of these apps are available for free (or at least offer a free trial), you can try several to figure out which would work best for you.

Position yourself.,
Get into a plank.,
Push your hips up to get into a pike position.,
Tuck your knees under.",How to Strengthen Your Core with an Exercise Ball1," You will need to get down on your hands and knees with the stability ball behind you. Place your hands about shoulder width apart and position your knees so they are under your hips.Make sure that the ball is close enough so that you can easily put your feet up on it.
You may also want to place a yoga mat on the floor before you get started to make this position a bit more comfortable.;
, When you are ready, place one shin at a time up on the top of the stability ball. Then, straighten your legs out and allow the ball to roll away from you or towards you as you balance yourself.








Keep your hands firmly planted on the ground under your shoulders.
Hold this position for as long as you can. Try starting out with 30 seconds and work up to holding the position for a full minute.

, Come out of the plank position and lift your hips upwards towards the ceiling. As you do so, roll the ball in towards you and allow your feet to rest on top of it.








When you are in the position, you should look like you are standing on your head. Hold this position for a few seconds and then come back down into a plank.
Repeat this process of piking and planking as many times as you can. Try doing this 10 times to start and then work up to 20 repetitions.
After you finish, get back into a plank.

, You can finish this routine by doing some reverse crunches. To do a reverse crunch, keep your hands firmly planted on the floor under your shoulders. Then, bend your knees and tuck them in towards your chest. As you do so, allow the ball to roll in towards you.








Repeat this exercise as many times as you like. Try doing 10 repetitions to start and work up to 20 reps.

Sit on the edge of the ball.,
Position your feet in front of you.,
Place your hands behind your head.,
Crunch forward.",How to Strengthen Your Core with an Exercise Ball2," To do crunches on an exercise ball, you will need to place it on the floor and sit down on it. Then, allow the ball to roll forward as you lean back onto the ball. Lean back until your back and shoulders are resting on the ball.

, Walk your feet out so that your knees are bending at a 90 degree angle and your feet are planted flat on the floor. This will help to keep you stable as you lean back on the ball.

, Next, take your hands and place your fingers loosely under your head. This will provide a bit of support for your head and neck, but you will not be pushing against your head with your hands.

, When you feel ready, contract your abs and use them to crunch forward slightly.A crunch is a small movement, so do not feel as though you need to sit all the way up. You should feel your ab muscles working as you do this.


Do not use your hands to force your head upwards. All of the movement should come from your abdominal muscles.

"
"
Lay down on your back.,
Squeeze and lift the ball.,
Turn onto your side.,
Lift the ball on your side.",How to Strengthen Your Core with an Exercise Ball3," You can also do some ball lifts to work your core muscles. To get started, place a yoga mat on the floor and lay down on your back. Position the ball in front of you so that it is easy to reach with your feet.

, Next, position the ball between your calves and squeeze it. Then, place your arms down at your sides and plant your hands on the yoga mat to brace yourself. When you feel ready, lift the ball with your calves. Bring it up as high as you can and then slowly lower it back down to the ground.Do 10 repetitions of this exercise.
Make sure that you are using your abs to lift the ball. You should feel your abs contract each time you lift and lower the ball.

, You can also work your obliques by lifting the ball. To do this, you will need to turn over onto your side, but keep the stability ball between your calves. Extend the arm closest to the floor above your head and rest your head on it. Then, place your other hand in front of you to steady yourself.

, When you are ready, contract your abs and raise the ball slightly.Don’t worry if you can only lift the ball a couple of inches above the floor. Even this small movement will work your obliques.


Do as many repetitions as you like and then switch sides. Try to start with 10 reps and then work up to 20 as you get stronger.

Buy a pedometer, or use a smartphone's pedometer app.,
Walk faster.,
Commute by walking or biking, instead of driving in a car.,
Avoid sitting for longer than 30 minutes at a time.,
Embrace twitching.,
Breathe deeply.,
Do your cleaning and household chores in 30 minute to 1 hour intervals.,
Cultivate outdoor hobbies.,
Get a dog or walk 1 for someone else.,
Plan active days out.",How to Stay Fit Without Exercise1," This can tell you how much exercise you already have in your daily schedule. Doctors recommend that you take at least 10,000 steps in a day to be healthy.


If you do not take this many steps in a day, you will need to find ways to be more active in your daily life. If you do not, you may be at risk for weight gain, high cholesterol, high blood pressure and chronic diseases.;
, If you commute, walk the dog or walk inside stores, do them faster. You will burn more calories, increase your heart rate and save time.

, If this is an option, your commute will not only take out the need to go to a gym, it can also release work-related stress and allow you to get more Vitamin D from sunlight.


If this is not an option, try to commute in more than 1 way. Take the bus half of the way and walk the rest of the way to work. You can also park 1⁄2 or 1 mile (0.8 or 1.6 km) away from the office, and walk to and from your car.

, People who sit in a desk for hours are at risk for chronic back pain. You burn 33 percent more calories when standing, and frequent walking around will help to stretch your muscles and improve your posture.

, Although twitching movements are sometimes frowned upon, tapping your fingers, stretching muscles, rolling your eyes, moving your neck and wrists, and frequent standing and pacing can help you to burn more calories and boost your metabolism. Move your legs or arms when you talk on the phone, watch TV or read.


Studies have shown a link between small muscle movements, metabolism and weight control. People who are skinny tend to incorporate more small movements into their daily life. They may not even be aware that they are doing it. Start a habit of moving your body in a way that is not likely to annoy you or others.

, Start a habit to relax, sit back and breathe deep into your diaphragm (chest). Inhale for 1 to 2 seconds and exhale for 2 seconds. Do this for 2 minutes at work, in the car, on the couch, while you are making dinner or before bed.

, Mopping, scrubbing, dusting, vacuuming, gardening, sweeping, window washing, car washing, raking and other chores qualify as exercise. Plan to break a sweat when you do your chores.


A British survey found that women said they cleaned approximately 2 and a half hours per week. This is approximately the same amount of moderate exercise that is recommended by doctors.

, Even if you hate to exercise, perhaps you like to throw a Frisbee with your dog, play baseball with your children or play basketball with friends. Incorporate socializing into your active hobbies and you are less likely to view them as exercise.

, Dogs require walking a few times a day, and longer walks on weekends. Turn this into a chance to get out, run alongside the dog or play fetch games.


Getting a dog is not a matter to be taken lightly. If you already have a dog, think of ways that you can play more with it. If you cannot afford to take care of a dog, see if any neighbors need a dog walker. Many times elderly people with pets cannot take them on long walks or to dog parks to run and play games.

, Go bowling, play tag, go bicycling, swimming, dancing, or play active video games with family or friends. Devote several nights and weekends to family or friend activities, rather than watching television or sitting at the computer.

Avoid sugar and processed foods.,
Eat fruit 2 or more times per day.,
Make sure 50 percent of all meals consist of vegetables.,
Eat smaller meals throughout the day, rather than 3 big meals.,
Exercise portion control.",How to Stay Fit Without Exercise2," If you eat fast food or junk food regularly, it is unlikely that you can stay fit without exercise. These ""empty calories"" require a lot more activity to burn off, without providing nutritional content to help your immune system or build strong muscles.

, Fruit contains sugar, but it also contains fiber, which helps to regulate your digestive system. If you feel a craving for sugar, eat a piece of fruit.

, Choose multi-colored vegetables to ensure you are getting all the vitamins and minerals you need. Eat 50 percent lean protein and whole grains, and devote the rest of your plate to raw or lightly cooked vegetables.

, Smaller meals will help you avoid feeling hungry throughout the day. One way to do this is to plan eating larger, healthy snacks between meals and shrink the size of your portions at breakfast, lunch and dinner.


This may be a hard step to undertake if you have a family. Experiment with snack and meal times for yourself, and then suggest it to family members if it is successful.

, If you do not plan to exercise, you must be more mindful of the amount you eat. Stop before you feel full, and concentrate on your food as you eat it, instead of eating while watching TV.

Perform an anaerobic fitness test.,
Do a push-up test.,
Take a curl-up test to test your abdominal strength.,
Take a flexibility test to see how flexible your muscle fibers are.,
Test your vertical jump.,
Record all of your findings.",How to Test Your Fitness Ability," If you are training for a specific test, it may also be beneficial to train with a partner, as studies have shown that training in tandem can encourage better fitness. Make sure your partner has a yardstick (91.44 cm ruler) and a stopwatch.;
, Take a 5 minute walk and stretch any tight muscles before beginning. You may also want to do arm circles or other warm-up exercises.

, Aerobic, or cardiovascular, fitness is the physical activity that you are capable of while your lungs are capable of supplying all the oxygen you need to complete the activity. Choose 1 of the following ways to test your cardiovascular ability on a flat track.


On the low end of the spectrum, choose a low-impact 1-mile walk. You should aim to walk 1 mile (1.6 km) within 16 minutes.
You can choose a 1.5 mile (2.4 km) jog. This should be completed within 15 minutes, although some tests will have much lower times that you have to reach, such as 10 minutes.
Do a 2-mile run. Most military tests will require a 2-mile run for entrance. Men must test between 13 and 20 minutes in order to qualify. They will receive a point score based on their time. Women must test between 15.5 and 20 minutes with point scores also allocated based on time.

, This is the test of how fast you can run 300 meters. If you will need to chase or apprehend people in your job, it will be required.


Mark a section of the track with chalk or tape at 300 meters (984 feet). Get ready at the starting line. Ask your friend to say, ""Go"" when the stopwatch begins. Sprint as quickly as you can. You should aim to reach between 56 and 71 seconds.

, Both standard and modified (knees-down) tests may be applicable. Place your shoes on the ground and form a plank with your body, bend your elbows back toward your body until you almost reach the ground, and then push back up to count 1 push up.


A modified push-up is usually used for testing women, who tend to test lower in upper arm strength. The knees must be far behind the body so that your back is straight from buttocks to shoulders. The elbows bend in, even with the body and you are lowered until you almost reach the ground and then raise yourself back up.
Many tests aim for a total of 25 push-ups. Point standards are given in the military for achieving between 5 and 77 for men and between 5 and 50 for women.

, Lay down on your back on a flat surface or yoga mat with your knees at a 90 degree angle. Ask your partner to place a piece of tape to indicate where your hands reach naturally as they lay by your side, and ask them to place another piece of tape 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) below that point.


Ask your partner to time how many of these curl-ups you can perform within 1 minute. You must reach the second piece of tape with each curl up. Remember to pace yourself so that you can continue for the full length of time. Record the number that you can do.
Army standards for females and males allot points for anywhere between 20 and 100 sit-ups performed in 1 minute. Other standards aim for approximately 35 or more sit-ups.
Although some organizations still require full sit-up tests, most rules have changed because full sit-ups have been found to be hard on your tailbone and back. The United States Presidential fitness test suggests using this curl-up test instead of full sit-ups. Read your organization's rules before taking the test.

, The most common way to do this is the sit-and-reach test. The following are instructions on how to complete the test:


Place a yardstick (91.44 cm ruler) on the floor. Tape it to the ground over the 15-inch (38.1 cm) mark.
Take off your shoes and sit on the floor. You should sit straight up with your feet 1 foot apart. Flex your feet and place them at the 14-inch (35.6 cm) mark. Place 1 hand over the other and touch the yardstick (91.44 cm ruler).
Exhale and stretch your hands forward slowly. Have your partner mark at what inch (cm) marker you can reach. Rest for 10 seconds. Perform the forward stretch 3 times and mark down all 3 scores.

, This may only be rarely required on tests, but it is a good judge of scaling abilities. Ask your friend to test you 3 times, just as was required with the sit and reach test.


Stand near a wall with your predominant arm straight up. Have your friend mark the height at which it reaches. Tape a ruler or yardstick (91.44 cm ruler) above that point. Ask your friend to stand on a step stool so they can accurately read your jumping ability.
Do a few practice jumps to warm up your legs. Crouch down low and touch as high on the ruler as you can. Wait 10 seconds. Repeat the jump 3 times and record your findings. Many tests aim for 16 inches.

, If you are doing this for general interest, you can submit your metrics to the United States President's Adult Fitness Test at adultfitnesstest.org. They will send you results on how you measure up based on adult fitness standards.

Once you have everything ready, it'll be easy to measure your results.One of the main components of this test, is timing how long you can balance for. Have a watch or stop clock ready.
Since many things can throw off your balance, its not recommended to time yourself. Ask a friend or family member to help you time your balance when you're performing the test.
You can choose to either wear tennis shoes or sneakers for this test. If you want, you may also choose to do this test barefoot.
Find an area to do this test where the floor is flat and even. In addition, this test should be completed where there are supports to hold on to or catch you if balance is lost. A table, sturdy chair, bars or other people are great options.;
, Once you have everything set up begin your balance test. To start, stand evenly with your feet flat on the ground and your hands on your hips. Both of your eyes should be open.


Choose whichever leg you want to start with. Lift your leg off the ground. You can hold your leg anywhere or anyhow, but do not rest the lifted leg on the standing leg. Hold this position as long as you can. You may find that your balance is better on one specific leg.

, To get an accurate result, you must stop timing once balance is lost.Inform the person helping you that balance is lost once you:


Move your arms from their current position in an attempt to maintain balance.
Move the raised foot in order to re-balance yourself.
Move the standing leg or weight-bearing foot in an attempt to maintain balance.
Open your eyes (if eyes were closed).
Move your torso or upper body in the attempt to stay balanced.
Have successfully completed the test for at least 45 seconds.

, To help you get an accurate result, it's best to test your balance 3 times. The average of your results are the most accurate and reliable.


Have your friend or family member assist you with 3 separate tests. Each test should be performed identically.If you need to take a break between tests, that's OK. But they should all be done within a few minutes of each other.
To get your average result, add up your 3 times. Then, take that total and divide by 3 to get your result.

, Once you've completed the standing balance test and have taken the average of your results, you can evaluate your balancing ability.In general, if you're over the age of 80, you should be able to balance for about 7 seconds.
If you're aged 70-79 years old, you should be able to balance for about 11-18 seconds.
If you're between 60-70 years old, you should be able to balance for 26-28 seconds.
If you're between the ages of 50-60 years old, you should be able to balance for about 36-38 seconds.
Anybody younger than 50 years old should be able to balance for at least 40 seconds.
If you stayed balanced for only 5-10 seconds, this indicates that you are at an increased risk for balance impairment. If you could not stay balanced for 5 seconds, this indicates you're at serious risk for fall injuries.

, In addition to performing the standing balance test in the conventional way, there is a slight modification you can make. Closing your eyes will give you more insight into where you get your balance from.


Perform the test the same way. The only difference here is that your eyes will be closed.
Many people rely heavily upon their vision to help them balance. When they perform this test with their eyes closed and cannot balance, this indicates they're at risk for falls or injuries at night or when vision is impaired.To modify the standing balance test, begin with the same equipment and the assistance from a friend or family member. However, your friend should stand close to you as you perform this test. If you were to lose your balance with your eyes closed, someone should be there to help you regain balance and prevent a fall.
Close your eyes at the same time you begin to lift your leg off the ground. Once the test is over you can open your eyes (if they haven't opened already to help you re-gain balance).

, Another method to test your balance is the tandem stance test. This particular test measures your base of support and is helpful for those who cannot perform the standing balance test well.You should wear tennis shoes or shoes with no heels for this test. Have someone time you during this test.
Stand straight to start. Then slowly bring the heel of your right foot to rest immediately in front of the toes of your left foot. Your right foot should remained flexed with toes pointing upwards.
Keep your arms either by your sides or rest your hands on your hips. Maintain this position for as long as you can or for at least 30 seconds.
If you cannot maintain your balance for at least 10 seconds during the tandem stance test, you're at increased risk for a fall injury.

, The alternative step test is another common method used by physical therapists to measure your ability to balance. In particular, this test measures lateral stability.To start this test, take off your shoes and socks - it should be performed barefoot. Again, ask someone to time you and to act as a support in case you lose your balance during this test.
Use the first step of a stair case or an aerobic step. Step up one foot and plant the entire foot firmly on the step.
As quickly and safely as you can, bring that foot down and lift the alternate foot up to the stair. Repeat by alternating between both feet as fast as you can.
To measure, track the time it takes for you to complete 8 steps between the right and left foot.
If it takes you more than 10 seconds to complete this task, you're at increased risk for falls.

, Another way to measure balance is by how fast and how easily you can get in and out of the sitting position. This movement can throw off the balance for those with balance issues.To start this test, find a sturdy backed chair. Having someone with a stop watch will be helpful so they can time how long it takes you to complete this test.
Whenever you're ready, start the clock and stand up and sit down 5 times as fast as you can.
You need to stand up fully and sit down completely (that means your buttocks comes into full contact with the chair).
If this test takes you longer than 13 seconds to complete, this indicates that you're at high risk for falling.

, If you've measured your balance and are noticing you have some difficulty, consider consulting with your physician. He will be able to guide you on your next steps.


Many people have difficulty balancing. It could be from a trauma, medical condition or age. However, if you're noticing a significant decline in balance or sudden loss of balance, call your doctor immediately.
Talk to him about when you noticed your difficulty and if you're having any other corresponding symptoms (like dizziness or light headedness).
Your physician may recommend that you go to physical therapy regularly to help strengthen your legs and core in addition to improving your balance.

, One way to increase and improve your balance is by practicing to walk heel to toe. This helps improve your coordination and balance as you walk.To start this exercise, put on a pair of sneakers or tennis shoes. Find a flat area to walk. If you need to, have someone walk next you to for support in case you lose your balance.
To start, put your right heel immediately in front of your left toes. Try not to look down at your feet. Choose a spot in front of you to focus on.
Take a step and then bring your left heel immediately in front of your right toes. Take another step and continue to alternate your feet in this fashion - aligning your feet heel to toe.
Do this exercise as long as you can and slowly work to build up more time as you improve.

, Some strength training exercises are also beneficial to help you improve balance. Backwards leg raises help strengthen your buttocks and hamstrings.To start, stand behind a sturdy backed chair and hold the back with your hands. You will slightly lean on the chair for support.
Your feet should start about shoulder width apart. Lift your right leg behind you, keeping your foot flexed.
Raise your leg without bending your knee or leaning forward towards the chair in front of you. Raise your leg until it's about a 45 degree angle from your body.
Hold the raised leg behind you for about 1-2 seconds. Then slowly lower back down to the floor. Repeat with the other leg. Do 10-15 times with each leg.

, Another important muscle group in your legs are the sides of your legs. These muscles help keep your body up right. This particular exercise helps build stability and balance.Like backwards leg raises, start side leg raises by holding onto the back of a sturdy chair. You should also be wearing tennis shoes for this exercise.
Slowly lift your right leg out away towards your body. Try not to bend your right leg or lean over to the left side.
Hold your leg out at about a 45 degree angle from your body. Keep holding this position for 1-2 seconds. Repeat 10-15 times on each side.

, Even if you had difficulty performing the standing balance test, you can modify this test and use it as an exercise to help improve your balance.To start this exercise, stand behind a sturdy backed chair. Use only one hand to hold onto the chair - not both.
Lift up one leg and keep it in the air in a comfortable position. Do not rest it on the weight-bearing leg. The hand not holding onto the chair should rest on your hip.
Try to hold this position for at least 10 seconds. Then, repeat with the other leg. Work up so you're able to do 10-15 times with each leg.

Understand how your body’s coordination works.,
Understand what can cause clumsiness.,
Measure how accident-prone you are.",How to Stop Being Clumsy1," The human body is a very complex system, and the operations that control physical coordination have plenty of room for mix-ups. There are four major body parts responsible for coordination, and dysfunction in any one of the areas (or multiple areas) can cause clumsiness.Eyes. The eyes take in outside information about the body’s physical position in space.
Brain and nervous system. The brain and nervous system relay messages throughout the body on how to respond to information about its physical environment.
Cerebellum. The cerebellum is an area of the brain that handles physical coordination and balance.
Muscles and bones. Your muscles and bones respond to commands from your brain and move you around.;
, There are a whole host of issues that can cause clumsiness, whether it’s temporary or a chronic problem. Some of these are serious medical issues, while others can be addressed at home.Some common causes of clumsiness include:


Head injuries
Joint hypermobility
Vision issues
Arthritis
Certain medications
Alcohol consumption or drug use
Stress and fatigue
Muscle weakness or disuse

, There isn’t a lot of research about why people are chronic klutzes, but some research suggests that people who are particularly accident-prone may experience “cognitive failures,” or lapses in attentiveness.A ""Cognitive Failures Questionnaire"" developed by experimental psychologist Donald Broadbent may help you quantify your clumsiness.Below are some sample items from his questionnaire; the more you answer ""yes"" to, the greater your probable level of proneness to these ""cognitive failures.""


“Do you fail to notice signposts on the road?”
“Do you find you confuse right and left when giving directions?”
“Do you bump into people?”
“Do you find you forget which way to turn on a road you know well but rarely use?”
“Do you forget where you put something like a newspaper or book?”
“Do you fail to see what you want in a supermarket (although it’s there)?”
“Do you drop things?”
“Do you find you accidentally throw away the thing you want and keep what you meant to throw away -- as in the example of throwing away the matchbox and putting the used match in your pocket?”

Increase your core strength.,
Develop your flexibility and agility.,
Work on your balance.,
Try vestibular ocular reflex (VOR) exercises.",How to Stop Being Clumsy2," Your core muscles, such as your abdominals, back, and pelvis muscles, help your body move with smoothness, stability, and coordination. Developing strength in these muscles will give you better control over how your body moves, which will help reduce clumsiness.Exercises such as ab crunches, single- and double-leg abdominal presses, the “Superman”, and planks all build functional core strength and can done at home or at the gym.
Exercise tools such as balance balls and wobble boards can help you build stability while increasing core strength.

, In addition to improving your core strength, you should also work on developing your flexibility to battle clumsiness.Studies show that athletes who focus only on strength training and don’t incorporate agility and flexibility exercises have a 70% chance of re-injury, as opposed to 8% for athletes who use both.In addition to the obvious exercises such as yoga and pilates, exercises such as dance and martial arts can also enhance your flexibility.Daily stretching is also useful for enhancing flexibility. It increases blood flow to your muscles and allows your joints to move more freely., Building core strength and increasing your flexibility are necessary components of training your body to avoid accidents, but so is enhancing your balance. There are several simple exercises you can do daily to improve your sense of balance.Shifting your weight from side to side, standing on one leg, and the Crane pose can all help improve your balance.

, “Vestibular Ocular Reflex exercises” is a fancy way of talking about exercises that improve hand-eye coordination. These exercises achieve this improvement by getting your brain, your inner ear and vestibular system (which are partly responsible for balance), your eyes, and your body to all work in sync with each other.Try this simple exercise to start: While sitting, bend your head down until you’re facing the floor, then look toward the ceiling with your eyes. Gradually move your head to follow the direction of your eyes. Repeat 10 times.You can also try this gaze stabilization exercise: While sitting, fix your gaze on a stationary target between 3-10 feet away from you. It should be at eye level. Move your head from side to side while maintaining your focus on the target. Repeat 3 times. Do this 3 times a day.These exercises can cause dizziness, so take it slow. If you feel nauseated or dizzy, stop and take a break.

Pay attention to what you're doing.,
Remove clutter.,
Change your footwear.,
Reduce anxiety.,
Avoid judging yourself.",How to Stop Being Clumsy3," Most people who are clumsy are not too aware of their surroundings. When you get up and start walking, look around and see if there is anything that you will step on, walk into, or run into.

, It’s easy to trip over things if you have stuff all over the floor. Decluttering your house and office will help eliminate opportunities for clumsiness.


If your home doesn’t have clear, open walkways throughout the house, you may also want to arrange your furniture differently. This can help keep you from bumping into things or tripping over them.
Using double-sided tape to secure the edges of throw rugs can help keep you from tripping over them., If you have balance issues, wearing shoes with high heels or narrow soles can disrupt your center of gravity and make you more likely to have an accident. Look for shoes with wide, firm soles that give you a solid foundation on the floor. If you must wear heels, look for chunky heels that will provide more stability., You are more distracted when you’re stressed or anxious, and this can lead to accidents and clumsiness. Take what steps you can to reduce stress in your daily life, and you may see your clumsiness improve too.Mindfulness training, which helps you learn to focus your attention on your actions in the moment, can not only reduce stress, it can also help with the “cognitive failures” that can cause clumsiness.
Try to get enough sleep. Research shows that sleep deficiency can cause a host of physical symptoms, including clumsiness and proneness to accidents., Clumsiness can cause a spiral of embarrassment and self-judgment, which in turn can increase anxiety and cause more clumsiness. Understand that everyone has the occasional klutz moment, and that even chronic clumsiness doesn’t mean anything is wrong with you.If you find yourself feeling embarrassed after a trip or a slip, try taking a few deep breaths. Deep, controlled breaths can enhance your sense of calm and self-collectedness, and can stop the cycle of self-blame in its tracks.

Understand some warning signs.,
Understand the side-effects of your medication.,
Visit your doctor.",How to Stop Being Clumsy4," While some people are naturally clumsy, and many of us have occasional bouts of clumsiness, conditions such as diabetes, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, and dyspraxia (a syndrome that affects mostly children) can also cause consistent problems with coordination and clumsiness.If you experience consistent dizziness or nausea, this could be a sign of blood sugar issues such as diabetes. Seek medical help if these symptoms are a frequent problem
Sudden numbness or weakness, difficulty seeing, and loss of balance or coordination can be signs of a stroke. Call for emergency assistance immediately if you experience these symptoms.
If your muscles sprain or strain easily, you experience frequent joint stiffness or muscle aches, or your joints dislocate easily, you may be suffering from a condition known as joint hypermobility. While this condition is usually not life-threatening, you should talk with a physician if you frequently experience these symptoms., Many medications, including psychiatric medications, migraine medications, and even allergy medications, can cause dizziness, balance issues, and a loss of coordination as side effects. These symptoms may be exacerbated by consuming alcohol. If you take medications that cause any of these side-effects, pay extra attention to your surroundings to reduce your chance of accidents.


If you feel as though the side-effects of your medication have become unmanageable, talk with your doctor. He or she may able to suggest an alternative medication.

, If despite your increased attentiveness and physical training you’re still having coordination issues, your clumsiness may be a symptom of a more serious medical issue. Visit your doctor and explain the issues you’re having to see if any treatments are available."

Start with Cindy.,
Build endurance with Helen.,
Try the bodyweight gone bad circuit.,
Push yourself with the baseline WOD.",How to Start Crossfit at Home1," The full Cindy is a 20-minute timed CrossFit workout consisting of pull-ups, push-ups, and air squats. The Half Cindy, timed at 10 minutes, is a good jumping off point if you've never done CrossFit before and want to start at home. The Half Cindy involves the same exercises on the same rotation as the full Cindy, but you'll do fewer reps overall.Start with five pull-ups. You are allowed to ""kip"" these pull-ups, which means you can use your legs and hips for leverage to push your body up over the pull-up bar. If you don't have a pull-up bar, you can do five burpees instead.Immediately drop to the ground and do 10 push-ups. Then do 15 air squats to finish the round.
After you finish your squats, return right back to pull-ups. Do as many rounds as possible in 20 minutes, or 10 minutes if you're doing a Half Cindy.;
, Helen is a challenging workout (Workout Of the Day, or ""WOD"" in CrossFit) in which you'll be competing against your fastest time. To do this workout at home, you'll need space to run, a pull-up bar, and a kettlebell.One round consists of a 400-meter run, 21 American kettlebell swings, and 12 pull-ups. To complete a full Helen, you'll do three rounds back-to-back for time.
Be careful not to max out your intensity in the first round, or you won't be able to complete three rounds.

, You'll need a stop watch for this circuit, because you're going to measure your rounds by the minute. This WOD consists entirely of bodyweight exercises so you can do it from home, even if you don't have any equipment.Start with one minute of air squats. Move immediately to one minute of push-ups, then one minute of sit-ups.
Do one minute of burpees, followed by one minute of jumping jacks, and then one minute of rest to close out the round. The entire workout consists of three rounds.
For each minute of each round, complete as many reps as you can with good form during the one-minute period. In CrossFit, this is abbreviated as ""AMRAP,"" which stands for ""As Many Reps/Rounds As Possible.""

, This WOD is one in which you'll compete against your best time. You want to do the prescribed exercises as quickly as possible with good form, but pace yourself so you're able to finish the workout.The baseline starts with a 500-meter row or a 400-meter run. Immediately after your run, do 40 air squats, followed by 30 sit-ups. Then do 20 push-ups, followed by 10 burpees. Notice the number of reps decreasing for each exercise.
Record your time so when you do this workout again you can aim for a faster time.

Visit the CrossFit website.,
Use the ""exercises and demos"" tab.,
Check your form.,
Look for bodyweight circuits.,
Modify or scale workouts as needed.,
Check the Workout of the Day (WOD).",How to Start Crossfit at Home2," If you want to start CrossFit at home, the CrossFit website, available at https://www.CrossFit.com, will help you become familiar with the CrossFit system and the workouts available.If you've already attended classes at a CrossFit box, you may already be familiar with the website. There are resources there that can help you set up a home gym.

, The CrossFit website contains a number of videos so you can learn the correct form for the various movements you'll commonly encounter in CrossFit workouts.If you've never done CrossFit before, keep in mind that form is extremely important. Because of the speed with which you'll do these exercises, incorrect form will greatly increase your risk of injury.

, Form and technique are crucial when you're doing CrossFit. You can learn correct form on the website, but you may want to have someone watch you as you complete movements and critique your form., Especially if you don't have a lot of equipment at home, bodyweight circuits are the easiest way to start CrossFit at home. These circuits typically can be done anywhere, and don't require anything other than a little bit of floorspace.The other benefit of bodyweight circuits, especially if you're just starting out, is that they typically consist of exercises with which you're already familiar, such as Burpees, squats, and sit-ups.
Most bodyweight circuits are timed, interval-style workouts in which you do as many repetitions of the prescribed exercise as you can during the time allotted.

, All CrossFit workouts are designed to be modified to suit your individual fitness level. For example, if you want to do the Cindy, which is a timed body-weight WOD, but you aren't yet fit enough to go for the full 20 minutes, you can cut the workout to 10 minutes and do a Half Cindy., The CrossFit WOD is posted on the CrossFit website. Coaches at individual CrossFit boxes also may have their own WODs posted on their websites, so if you have a local box you like, you also might check there.Using a local WOD may be beneficial to you if there's a local box that more closely matches the fitness goals you've set, or if you plan on attending classes at that box in the future and want to get familiar with the coach's style.

Make sure you have enough space.,
Check the CrossFit message boards.,
Start with weights.,
Install a pull-up bar.,
Add rings for muscle-ups and other movements.,
Include dumbbells and kettlebells.,
Equip your gym with workout and safety tools.",How to Start Crossfit at Home3," When you're designing your own home gym, space to move around is perhaps the most important quality. If you're constantly bumping into equipment or having to move things around, you're not going to get as much benefit from your workout.Since many CrossFit workouts are timed, you won't be able to complete the workout as it's meant to be done if you constantly have to stop and move things around.
Walk through some basic routines and mark out the floor space you're going to need. Then add in your equipment around that space.

, Particularly if you have limited floor space, the message boards on the official CrossFit website include tips and images from other CrossFitters that will help you make the most of the space you have available.Some posts include photos of other CrossFitters' home gyms so you can get some ideas, as well as tips for how to store equipment vertically on walls so you don't take up so much precious floorspace.

, Since approximately 80 percent of the CrossFit WODs that aren't bodyweight-only involve using weights, a bar and some weights should be one of the first pieces of equipment you get for your home gym.Don't worry about buying a bench, since you won't really use it in CrossFit. You just need to make sure you have a rack for the bar. The rack doesn't have to be fancy, just something that will enable you to load the bar at shoulder height for heavy squats.
You also don't need to worry about getting heavier weights in the beginning, especially if you're just getting started with CrossFit. Just buy weights a couple sizes up from what you're capable of lifting now.

, Various styles of pull-ups are a staple of many CrossFit WODs, so a pull-up bar is essential if you want to start CrossFit at home. If you don't have a lot of space, you can always mount it in a doorway., Rings are used in several different CrossFit WODs, although they won't get used as much as the weights and the pull-up bar. All the same, they're worth getting since they're relatively inexpensive and don't take up too much space., Kettlebells are used relatively frequently in CrossFit, and most home gyms will automatically have a good set of dumbbells. If you're running low on floorspace, these pieces of equipment can be stored on racks mounted on the wall.Focus on keeping your home gym clean and efficient, so that everything is visible and can be retrieved easily and put away easily. Rid the area of anything unrelated to working out, such as automotive accessories or laundry.

, Not only should your home gym have the right workout equipment, it also should be functional. Leave tools such as a clock, tape, chalk, and a fan in your gym at all times.Get some rubber flooring to protect your joints and help prevent injury. You don't want to do your workouts on the cement floor of a garage.
Clocks or stopwatches are essential for timed workouts. Keep these and other tools neatly stored away in a bin when not in use.
You also might want to get a whiteboard so you can write your WOD on the wall just like they do in CrossFit boxes.

Locate a box near you.,
Talk to a coach.,
Evaluate the quality of the box critically.,
Take a free class.,
Take a Level 1 Certificate Course.",How to Start Crossfit at Home4," There are CrossFit affiliates in 142 countries on seven continents. Depending on where you live, you should be able to find a CrossFit box that is relatively convenient for you.If you've never been to a CrossFit box before, try to find more than one so that you can visit several and compare. Different CrossFit coaches have different styles, and boxes vary in quality as well as general atmosphere. While you want to find a box that is convenient, you also want to make sure you feel comfortable there.
You can search for CrossFit boxes near you on the CrossFit website. If the box has its own website, explore that website as well to learn more about that particular location.

, Just as not every CrossFit box is alike, not every CrossFit coach is alike either. Not only do you want to work with a coach who motivates and inspires you, but you want that coach to have adequate training and experience to benefit you.Since the minimum qualifications to be a CrossFit coach are relatively low, interview the coaches who would be working with you at each box you visit to learn more about their background and experience.
Ask for references, and talk to other box members to get their opinions about the quality of the coaching there.
Find out if each coach has specific certifications or qualifications, and ask to see proof of those. You also should ask questions about the lifestyle and nutrition resources available at each box.

, CrossFit doesn't have a quality control system for affiliates – all they have to do is pay the affiliate fee each year. For this reason, quality varies.Visit several boxes in your area and compare them. Look at overall cleanliness, class size and structure, and friendliness. You will start to see ways in which some boxes are better than others.
Make sure that the owner and staff are trained in CPR and First Aid. CrossFit can get intense, so you need to confirm that there are employees who are capable of handling emergencies.

, Most CrossFit boxes will let you take a free introductory class so you can try out the experience and decide whether you want to commit to regular classes. It can be a good way to meet other people as well as get a feel for how a CrossFit class is run.Arrive at your intro class early so you have time to get acclimated before the class begins and don't have to rush. You should be ready to go when the class starts.
After the class, the coach may offer a question and answer session, particularly if the intro class consists entirely of prospective members. Stay for the whole session and pay attention – someone else might ask a question you hadn't thought of but that's important to you.

, If you're serious about training with CrossFit, even if you plan to do most of your training at home rather than joining a CrossFit box, the Level 1 Certificate Course will teach you the foundational movements.You typically can sign up to take this course separately, without having to commit to any additional sessions at a CrossFit box.
Once you've completed the Level 1 course, you can be confidant that you're doing the foundational movements with correct form. This enables you to safely start CrossFit at home.

Adopt a healthy lifestyle.",How to Start Waist Training," Waist trainers are not a replacement for diet or exercise. They may only achieve temporary results. Waist trainers function by squeezing in fat tissue to reduce fluid in your tissue. This then compresses and displaces your internal organs. Use waist trainers with caution.

Waist trainers can cause discomfort, difficulty breathing, or even heartburn. If you experience any of these symptoms, take the waist trainer off immediately.;
, Latex waist trainers, however, can help boost the heat at the body’s core, which can help burn belly fat faster.Latex waist trainers are more like cinchers than full corsets. When worn they will immediately make your waist look an inch or two smaller, whereas a full corset will immediately take several inches off the appearance of your waist plus the other areas it covers.
Steel-boned corsets also offer more postural support, cinching, and hourglass shaping than latex trainers.There are different types of cinchers. They are mostly made from latex, spandex, or nylon, and some have plastic boning.
Cinchers are believed to be more comfortable to work out in and sleep in than steel-boned corsets, although it is still possible to sleep in a steel-boned corsets. When a steel-boned corset is fitted correctly to your body, it should also be quite comfortable for sleeping, but not for exercise.

, Both latex cinchers and steel-boned corsets can show through your clothing. Steel-boned corsets are bulkier than cinchers, making cinchers the better choice for more fitted outfits.


Cinchers will still show through sheer shirts and flimsy fabrics, so keep this in mind when choosing a cincher color.
If you are really committed to waist training, and you have the money to spend, you might consider getting a couple of different trainers or corsets just so you have some selection.

, Make sure that you know what you can and can’t do while wearing a waist trainer. Experts recommend against doing abdominal exercises while wearing a waist trainer.Some companies offer different types of waist trainers for different purposes. As an example, one company sells work-out corsets, but even these cannot be worn for all types of exercises.If you have a steel-boned corset, do not work out in it. This is not made for working out in, although you can sleep in it., You’ll need to know your natural was it size in order to choose the right size of waist trainer. Here’s how to measure your waist:


Remove any clothing that is covering your midsection.
Your waist is between the bottom of your ribs and the tops of your hip bones. It’s generally the narrowest part of your torso, where you bend from side to side.
Wrap a measuring tape around your waist, keeping it parallel to the floor so that it sits evenly around your waist. Make sure that it fits snugly against your torso but doesn’t dig into it.
Don’t suck in your stomach as this will make your waist seem smaller than it is. Breathe in and out to gauge roughly where your waist sits at its natural state.
Look down. Wherever the end of the measuring tape is sitting while you’re relaxed with it evenly around your waist, that’s your natural waist size. As an example it might read 29 inches (or more, or less).

, Sizing can differ slightly depending on the manufacturer, so always be sure that you’re clear on the sizing before ordering your corset.


For steel-boned corsets, some manufacturers say that if your waist is under 38 inches, you should order a corset with a waist size that is 4 to 7 inches smaller, and if your natural waist is over 38 inches, order a corset that is 7 to 10 inches smaller.So if your waist is 29 inches, try starting with a corset with a 25-inch waist.
For latex waist trainers the sizing is a bit more straightforward. Just choose the trainer size that is in line with your natural waistline. If you have a 29-inch waistline, you’ll probably want to choose a waist trainer that fits a 28- to 30-inch waistline.
If you have any doubts whatsoever about sizing or fit or anything else, it’s always best to contact the manufacturer directly. They will be able to tell you more about the specific sizing of their products, and can help you make the right choice.
Both steel-boned corsets and latex waist trainers should lie flat against your midsection. If they roll up, bulge, or buckle at all, they are likely too small, and you should get a larger size., Well-made corsets and waist trainers will feel strong and secure. The seams will be well-stitched and, if they have bones, these will not dig into your body when the corset is on.


If it’s a lace-up corset or cincher, the grommets should also be well secured, and the corset should not buckle under the tension of being laced up.If you are buying your waist trainer online, be sure to read lots of online reviews before buying it. It’s something that you’ll be wearing every day, for several hours a day, so get the highest-quality one that you can afford.

, This will help prevent your core muscles from atrophying once you’re wearing a trainer for several hours a day. Don’t take this advice lightly, otherwise you’ll end up being dependent on the waist trainer to hold you up.Failing to work out before and during waist training will give you the opposite of your desired effects. Your stomach will look flabby due to a lack of stomach muscles as your waist trainer has taken over for your core in holding your body upright.Some good core exercises include planks, side twists, weighted crunches, and leg lifts. Aim to do these exercises 3 times each week.</ref>
While some people do work out while wearing waist trainers, doctors recommend against it as it can interfere with your ability to breathe, make it difficult for you to get a full workout, and contribute to back acne., Your waist trainer should come with instructions on how to put it on. These may depending on the style and manufacturer, but here are some general instructions:


Many people find it helps to wear a thin-fabric top beneath the corset to prevent skin irritation. A soft camisole or close-fitting tank top will do nicely.
For a steel-boned corset, loosen it all the way and undo any snaps. Ensure that it is right side up and slide it around your body, with the snaps at the front and laces at the back. If your corset has a modesty flap (the panel of fabric that sits beneath the laces on your back), it should just touch the other side of the corset.

Before tightening the laces, hook the eyes. It can help to start at the middle.
Next, reach behind and grab your lacing loops, then pull them away from you to tighten the waist.


For a latex waist trainer, there are no laces involved. There will likely be two sets of snaps at the front of your trainer (i.e. these sit on your stomach). Start at the widest setting (the first set of snaps), and then move on to the tighter setting as you grow accustomed to the trainer., For the first several days of wearing your waist trainer or steel-boned corset, make sure that you take time to slowly break it in:For a steel-boned corset, don’t lace it too tightly when first putting it on. It should fit snugly, but you should still be able to slide at least a few fingers or even your whole hand in the top or bottom of the corset. The boning will adjust to your shape with time. After wearing it for about an hour, you can tighten it more.

, If you tighten your corset before you and it are ready, you’ll risk warping the corset and possibly even hurting yourself. Go slow. A properly seasoned corset will mould to your body, making it much more comfortable to wear.Regardless of what type of waist trainer you’re wearing, remember not to go too tight the first time you put it on. Give it time to mould to your body, and it will be much more comfortable and effective in the long run.

, From days 4 to 14 of wearing your corset or trainer, Gradually increase your wear time from 1.5 to 2 hours a day to 6 to 8 hours a day, or more.Don’t immediately start wearing your corset for 12 hours a day. Even when you’re advanced, you can get away with 6 to 8 hours a day and still see results.
Latex waist-trainer experts recommend wearing them for 8 to 10 hours each day.Some people wear their steel-boned corsets for up to 23 hours a day. Be sure to know the risks involved with lengthier periods of waist-training. Above all else, make sure that you are never in pain., You should start seeing results within a month of wearing your waist trainer, but it can take longer.


If you’re already quite slim and fit, you might not see a significant change for up to 2 months.
Your results will depend on your lifestyle (i.e. diet and exercise), body type, and how long you wear the waist trainer each day.

, You’ll be able to see the corset through a lot of shirts, so make sure that nothing is too thin, flimsy, or sheer, otherwise you’ll be able to see the corset through it., If you experience pain, numbness in your limbs, or stomach issues such as acid reflux or heartburn, loosen or remove your waist trainer or corset., Place its laces over the hanger so that they don’t drag the corset down or get caught in anything.


Unless the manufacturer tells you otherwise, you should never wash a corset.
If you spill something on your corset, you can probably spot clean it with a damp cloth, but that’s the extent of it.
Each manufacturer will have their own cleaning instructions, so check with them before cleaning your corset.

, Drink enough water, eat a healthy diet, and exercise regularly. Doing all of these things will help you see more significant results while waist training.


It can also help to avoid foods and drinks that make you bloat, which will be doubly uncomfortable when you’re wearing a corset or latex waist trainer.Many doctors agree that proper nutrition and regular exercise will do more to trim your waist than a waist trainer will.Planks and twisting crunches are recommended.

Take a rest day or two if you need it.",How to Strength Train As an Older Adult," When you're first starting or incorporating a strength training routine, it's important to ease into it. Doing too much exercise or using a weight that's not appropriate for you can cause an injury.Although including two to three days of strength training is recommended, start with just one day a week. This will help you ease into a new routine.
Also start with low weights. If you're using dumbbells or a weight machine, choose the lowest weight level to start.
You can also just use your body weight instead of lifting actual weights. Some bodyweight exercises are a little better to start with.;
, A short warm-up routine is not only important with aerobic exercises, they are important for strength training activities as well. Warm-ups help prevent injury by slowly increasing your heart and breathing rate and increasing the blood flow to your muscles. In addition, moving your joints through their full range of motion causes your body to secrete more synovial fluid, which lubricates and stabilizes your joints.A warm-up is just a lighter intensity or slower version of your planned activity. It should be done for about 5 minutes or so.For strength training in particular, try doing some basic range of motion movements such as long strides, shoulder rolls, wrist, elbow and ankle circles, and knee bends, and doing some walking. This can help warm up your muscles and improve your range of motion at your joints.

, One particularly good strength training exercise for adults is a chair squat. This exercise helps strengthen your legs, hip and buttocks. Doing this regularly can help you build up enough lower body strength to do other exercises.Start by standing in front of a sturdy chair — your back should be facing the chair. It shouldn't have wheels on the feet and should have a sturdy seat and back.
Stand straight with your feet just slightly wider than hip-width apart. You can keep your arms at your sides.
Placing most of your weight into the heels of your feet, start to slowly bend your knees. You should look like you're about to sit down in slow motion. If you wish, reach your arms up into the air — this may encourage you to keep proper form as you sit.
Slowly lower down until your butt almost touches the chair. Keep the head up and back as vertical as possible. Then slowly rise back up to a straight, standing position.
If you cannot lower far enough down to the seat of the chair, that's OK. Start by lowering yourself down as far as you can get. With more practice, you'll be able to do more.
You should aim to do one set of 10 chair squats. Once you're comfortable with this amount, increase to two sets of 10 chair squats.

, As you age, it's very important to work on strengthening the back and protecting the spine. Bridging can help strengthen the muscles in the lower back and help stretch your hip flexors.Start out lying on your back on a yoga mat. Place a pillow under your head for comfort if you wish. Your arms should be at your sides, knees bent with feet flat on the ground.
Gently lift your buttocks off the ground as high as you comfortably can and hold for a few seconds. Keep your abs pulled tight to protect your spine.
Slowly sink your hips back to the ground.
Repeat 10 times or as many times as you comfortably can.

, The wall push-up is a great exercise to help strengthen your upper body. One of the nice things about this exercise is, unlike the standard floor push-up, you don't have to get down on the ground to perform it.Start this exercise by standing in front of a sturdy wall. The wall should be clear of hanging objects like pictures or of windows.
While facing the wall, place your palms flat on the wall (fingers pointing upwards) at shoulder height. You should be standing close enough to the wall that your elbows have a slight bend in them.
While keeping your feet planted firmly on the ground, slowly bend your elbows allowing your body to come closer to the wall. Keep your elbows pointed down — your arms should not look like ""chicken wings"" out to the sides; this places strain on the shoulder joint. Do this in a slow and controlled motion.
Stop when your face is just a few inches from the wall. Pause here and then slowly push yourself back to your starting position.
Aim for one set of 10 wall push-ups to start with. Once you're doing well with this amount, try increasing to two sets of 10 push-ups.
If you experience pain in the fingers or wrists in this position, you can also try this with your hands placed on a counter top using the palm to push away from the counter. The fingers can remain curled in this position and the wrist should stay straight.

, To help strengthen the muscles in your calves, feet and ankles, try incorporating toe stands. This is a great exercise to help build lower leg strength which can help improve your strength for walking.Stand behind a sturdy chair. It shouldn't have wheels on the feet and needs to have a strong back on which you can lean.
Place your hands on the top of the back of the chair to start. Your feet should be shoulder width apart.
Slowly press yourself up until you are standing on your tiptoes. Hold this position for one to two seconds. Then slowly lower yourself down back to your starting position with feet flat on the floor.
Repeat this exercise 10–15 times per set. You can increase to two sets as you become stronger over time.

, If you use light and small hand weights, you can perform a variety of simple upper body exercises. Moves like bicep curls or deltoid raises can help strengthen your arms.Repeat exercises 10 times per set to start with.


Start with using a set of 1 or 2 pound dumbbell hand weights. This weight is very low and will be appropriate for most older adults (even without previous strength training experience).
To do deltoid raises, continue to sit in your chair with a dumbbell in each hand. Bend your arms at your elbows to form a 90 degree angle. Lift your elbows up and away from your body until your upper arm is parallel to the floor. Then, lower your arms back down to the starting position.
To do shoulder presses, sit in your chair and continue to hold a dumbbell in each hand. With palms facing forward, press the dumbbells straight up over your head until your arms are fully extend. Slowly bend your elbows to allow your arms to come back down to your sides.
To do bicep curls, sit in a sturdy chair and hold one dumbbell in each hand. Slowly bend your elbows and bring your hands up to your shoulders. Release and lower your arms back down to an extended position by your sides.

, Although strength training comes with a lot of health benefits, it's always important to talk to your doctor first. As you age, it's important to prevent injury and choose exercises that are appropriate for you.


If you're interested in incorporating more strength training, meet with your doctor. Talk about your fitness goals and how you're planning on reaching your goals.
Ask your doctor if there are any specific restrictions that you should follow. Does he recommend a weight restriction? Should you keep your heart rate lower? Are there specific exercises you shouldn't do?
Also ask if there is a certain area of your body or types of exercise your doctor would like you to focus on. For example, does he want you to improve your balance? Or would he like you to improve your core strength?

, In addition to meeting with your physician, you may also want to consider meeting with a personal trainer who has experience training older adults. These fitness professionals can help you plan and work towards meeting your fitness goals.


A personal trainer who has training working with older adults will know the exercises most important for aging bodies. Those include exercises for maintaining or improving balance, posture and function. There are also movement patterns and exercises that older adults should avoid since they place too much strain on an aging spine.
Personal trainers are a great option if you aren't very active currently or haven't been in the past. They can teach you and provide hands-on guidance on how to perform certain exercises.
Look for a local personal trainer or find someone at the gym you belong to. Make sure to ask if she has experience working with older adults.
Ask her to give your specific exercises that are within your current fitness range. Also make sure to express what you specific fitness goals are or ask her to help you set realistic, achievable goals.

, When you start your strength training program, you might want to consider keeping an exercise journal. This is a great place to track what you're doing and what results you're seeing over time.


An exercise journal can help document your progress with your strength training routine. You'll notice changes in your muscle tone, muscle mass and even your overall strength. Track these changes in your journal.This journal is a great way to stay accountable to yourself. Tracking every week can help you stick to your strength training routine long-term.
Keep note of what exercises you're able to do, how many sets you can do and what your goals are. This is a great motivational tool as well.
There are also many apps available to download onto your smartphone that can help you track exercise and diet.

, If you are interested in starting a strength training routine, it's important to set goals for yourself. Setting specific goals can help you stay on track to your achievements.


The first important part of goal setting is making goals specific. These tailored goals will help you stay on track and keep you motivated.
For example, ""increasing strength"" is a great goal, but very broad. Instead, your goals should be ""I want to increase my lower body strength by doing leg strengthening exercises two to three days a week for 20 minutes."" Or something like ""I want to be able to balance on one leg without help for 30 seconds or one minute."" Then ramp it up to include arm movements while standing one one leg.
Also make sure your goals are realistic. Although it's great to have some loftier goals, these might not happen for some time. Instead, set goals that you'll be able to reach within a month or two. Continue to set more goals after you've made progress on initial goals.

, With any type of new fitness program, have the right types of equipment to meet your goals. You may only need some weights and a sturdy chair to work out at home, or you may wish to go to a gym with machines.


If you currently belong to a gym, fitness center or rec center, they will most likely have a large variety of strength training equipment available to use. Talk to your doctor or personal trainer about what's appropriate.
If you do not belong to a fitness center, you may want to purchase some home equipment. You do not need much, however some resistance bands and a set of light dumbbells is great to have.
If you want to and are able, you may want to invest in a fitness or yoga mat. These make floor exercises much more comfortable to do.

, Although strength training is a great activity to include in your weekly routine, aerobic exercise is equally important as you age. Make sure to also include some heart-pumping exercises in your fitness plan.


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that all adults, including older adults, aim for about 150 minutes of aerobic activity each week.You can split this activity up and aim for about 30 minutes five days a week or about 20 minutes daily.
Like strength training, aerobic exercises come with some great health benefits. These exercises specifically can help you lose weight or maintain a healthy weight, lower your blood pressure, improve your cholesterol levels and improve your mental health and mood.Try exercises that are appropriate for your current fitness level. You can try: walking, water aerobics, using the elliptical or riding a stationary bike.

, Both balance and flexibility training are important components to a well-balanced fitness routine. In addition, practicing exercises that improve balance and flexibility can also prevent common injuries that occur as you age.About 1/3 of those who are over 65 years old fall every year. Falls and the injuries that are associated from them can significantly impact the health of an older adult.
Incorporating specific exercises to help improve balance may help prevent you from falling and causing serious injury to yourself.
Flexibility exercises in particular help keep your muscles loose and maintain your range of motion. Stretching and similar exercises can help make everyday activities, like getting dressed, much easier., Planned and structured activity (like going for a 30 minute walk or doing 20 minutes of strength training) is an important part of your overall health and wellness; however, it's also important to try and stay active in your leisure time.


Lifestyle activities are exercises you do as part of your normal daily routine. Walking to get the mail, grocery shopping or sweeping the floor all count as lifestyle activities.As you get older, it's important to stay active and independent. Even though it may be easy to get in the habit of being more sedentary, try to stay active with household chores and lifestyle activities.
Think about your typical day. How much sitting do you do? Are there areas or times where you could take more steps or be more active?
Try doing more activities like taking the stairs if you're able, going for short walks during the day, parking farther away or standing during commercial breaks as you watch TV.

, You might be surprised, but including an adequate amount of time off from exercise is important. This is especially true when it comes to strength training exercises.You might think that muscle grows and becomes stronger when you're working out; however, the opposite is true. Muscles actually grow in both size and strength during rest.
Too much strength training can also make you feel more tired and fatigued. Although it's OK to exceed the recommended one to two days of strength training, don't over do it.
Include about one to two rest days each week. You can still do light walking or other aerobic exercise, but make sure to give your muscles a true break.

Find physically active ways to sightsee.,
Choose an outdoor destination.,
Rent kayaks or bicycles.,
Do something active every day.",How to Stay Fit During Your Vacation1," Instead of a tour bus or car, sightsee in a more physical way. Check out the sights on foot, or rent a bicycle to get around.Walking around a city on foot lets you get a more personal, up close view of the city. You’re able to interact with the people and the community instead of looking at it from a vehicle.
Some cities offer bicycle tours. You can check into finding one of those, or you can rent bicycles and make your own bicycle tour.;
, When you’re planning your vacation, consider skipping cities and instead go for an outdoor destination. National parks are great areas for an active, fun vacation, complete with lodging with amenities. You can also try resorts, like ski resorts, or island destinations with swimming, kayaking, and mountain climbing.Look for destinations that offer physical activities, like a river rafting trip, a hike through the jungle, a walk to the tallest mountain in the state, riding horses on a ranch, or surfing on the beach.
Look for places to hike. Not all hikes have to be super strenuous to the top of a 10,000 foot mountain. Most national and state parks, and many national forests, nature preserves, and resorts, offer all kinds of hiking for you to enjoy.
If you’re feeling particularly adventurous, consider camping outdoors.

, If you’re going to a beach destination, fun activities for the whole family are kayaking and bicycling. Most beach towns have multiple places for you to rent these things.If you’re driving and are able, you can take your own bicycles or kayaks with you.
If you don’t want to think about working out at a gym during your vacationing, doing fun activities like kayaking and bicycling will get you active without making it feel like exercise.

, While you may want to use your vacation for relaxing, that doesn’t mean you can’t relax and stay active. You don’t have to run a marathon every day, just include physical activity into your daily routine.Instead of sitting on the beach all day, go for a walk along the beach. Walk through a local park or around the city.

Gradually increase the difficulty of your workout.,
Keep a regular workout schedule.,
End with a cool down.",How to Speed Up Workout Recovery," It has long been thought that stretching before a workout decreases inflammation and the chances of injury, but recent findings show that this is not true. In fact, stretching cold muscles can actually lead to injury and reduced performance and strength.Instead of static stretches, focus on a dynamic warm up that uses the muscles you will use during your workout and gradually increases your range of motion.For instance, if you are going to run or jog, warm up by walking and incorporate some dynamic stretches, such as skipping, butt-kicks, backward jogging, side-stepping, etc.Kinetic stretching, where you’re continuously moving your muscles as you stretch rather than holding a static pose, is the best way to increase circulation. Try walking forward with long, lunging steps and then swinging your arms in a circular motion.;
, The way you sit or lay down can cut off your blood flow to certain muscle areas and prevent healing. Try to have your limbs unfolded whenever possible.Don’t sit with your legs folded underneath you. This can restrict circulation.
Try to sleep flat on your back with your arms unfolded after a workout. This will maximize your circulation.
If you aren’t comfortable sleeping on your back, try to sleep on your left side rather than your right. Because your heart and major arteries are slightly to the right of the center of your chest, sleeping on your right side will disrupt circulation., Ice will reduce swelling and numb the soreness. There are a number of topical creams and ointments that serve a similar effect.


Leaving ice on for more than 30 minutes can reduce circulation and prevent your muscles from healing.Ointments that are designed to feel cold during application and then warm up later are ideal for preventing swelling.
Mineral Ice is an excellent option for numbing painful muscle strain., Aspirin will temporarily prevent your blood from coagulating which, in turn, will increase your circulation and prevent swelling. It will also serve as a light pain reliever so you won’t be bothered by soreness.Do not take aspirin if you are under 19 years old, as it has been linked to the development serious condition called Reye's Syndrome.
Overuse of aspirin is harmful for your stomach and liver. Do not take an aspirin after every workout. Only use it when your muscles feel particularly inflamed or you have acute pain.Do not take aspirin if you have any unhealed cuts on your body, especially if you got them from the workout you just completed. The coagulation that aspirin is designed to prevent is your body’s natural mechanism for stopping bleeding and healing damaged skin.

, Gently rubbing the tense muscle area will relieve tension and increase circulation. Use the tips of your fingers and press lightly into your skin. Push up and down the length of the muscle until you start to feel the pain subside.


A massage can release endorphins that will also act as a natural pain-reliever.A professional, therapeutic massage is also a good idea. Deep tissue massage techniques like shiatsu are excellent for relieving pain, improving flexibility and increasing circulation after a workout.Be careful of massaging too hard which can worsen the effects of muscle strain or cause further injury.

, This is another method of self-massage that is favored by trainers, physical therapists, and professional athletes. You can use a foam roller or tennis or lacrosse ball to target trigger points, or specific knots in your muscles that can cause pain elsewhere on your body.To use a foam roller or ball, position the roller underneath the painful part of your body (do not use this method on a joint, bone, or your lower back). Lying on the roller or ball and moving very slowly — no faster than one inch per second — uses your own bodyweight to loosen trigger points.When you reach an area that feels tight or is painful, remain there for five to 30 seconds. You should begin to feel the muscle release.

, Drinking lots of water will remove toxins from your body that cause muscles to build up restrictive starches. It will also support your body’s natural restorative functions.


Dehydration will make muscle pain worse and cause you to lose energy.
Drink plenty of unsweetened, clear fluids including green tea with antioxidants, which help remove waste products.

, Getting at least eight hours of sleep every night is essential for your metabolism and muscle rejuvenation.Having a regular sleep schedule is important for your metabolism as well. Irregular sleep schedules will confuse your body and cause you to feel tired at inopportune times., Consuming food that provides lean, easily burnable energy is essential for maximizing your workout and recovering from aches and pains.


Lean meats and legumes are excellent sources of healthy protein. Protein will restore tears in your muscles and give you more energy.Foods with essential fatty acids (like omega-3s) will support restorative processes in your body, such as hormonal restoration and oxygen regulation. Cold-water fish and flaxseed oil are high in good fat.Make fruit part of your post-workout recovery meal. Adding blueberries to a protein shake provides you with antioxidants and can speed up your muscle recovery.Tart cherries can also decrease muscle soreness and inflammation.Try to avoid foods with saturated and trans fats and sugar.

, Occlusion training involves blocking off the flow of blood to muscles you’re working out. This will allow you to build resistance and flexibility in your muscles and has been shown to relieve pain.Buy occlusion cuffs which will allow you to restrict blood flow with precision. They are available at most sporting goods stores and some commercial gyms.
If you’re working on your arms, wear the cuffs on your bicep midway between the elbow and shoulder. If you’re working on your legs, wear the cuffs on your thigh midway between your knee and hip joint.

, If you are trying to lift a large amount of weight or perform a large number of reps, start slow at first. Your muscles will adjust to the strain and will be more resistant to injury.

, As with sleep schedule, your body adjusts to your workout routine. Try to be consistent with the with the intensity and frequency of your workouts and make sure you also incorporate rest days into your schedule. Overtraining can lead to fatigue and inflammation.Make sure you are not working the same muscles every day — your muscles need 24 to 72 hours to rebuild and recover. Working the same muscles day after day causes muscle tenderness, stiffness, and reduced joint range of motion and muscle flexibility., If you’re doing a particularly intense workout, you’ll want to end your routine with a lighter exercise. Your muscles literally heat up in temperature when you’re exercising and then get colder when you stop working. That immediate change from hot to cold can make strains and injuries worse and slow down your recovery.Cardio and stretching are the best options for cool downs because they keep the blood flowing through muscles without straining them.

Educate yourself on heat illnesses.",How to Stay Cool During Summer Workouts," If you know that the hot weather season is coming up, plan to get acclimated to the upcoming hotter days. This will help your body get used to the heat and stay cooler.


Initially, your body may not deal well with high temperatures; however, over time, your body gets used to the heat, sweats more and learns to cool itself more efficiently.A few weeks before the heat hits, practice exercising outdoors. Try working out just a few days a week for shorter periods of time outside.
It generally takes a few weeks to get your body acclimated to the hotter weather. Once you're used to it, you sweat more which ultimately keeps your body cooler. Just remember that when you sweat more, you need to replenish those lost fluids, so increase your water intake, too.;
, In addition to planning in advance for hot weather, also plan when you're going to exercise. There are better times during the day to help you stay cool.


In general, the early morning hours and the late evening hours are the coolest times of day to exercise.If you can, schedule in your outdoor exercise for these hours. You may need to get up a littler earlier or plan to exercise after dinner.
Try to avoid exercising right in the middle of the day. Lunchtime and early afternoon are the hottest and when the sun is the strongest.

, When you do decide to exercise outside, see if you can plan a route or find an area that's a bit shadier. Whenever you're in the shade, you will feel cooler than in the sun.


If you're going for a run, walk or bike ride, look for a path with a lot of trees or along city blocks that are shaded by the building shadows.
If you're doing exercises outside, look for large trees that provide a lot of shade and try to stay underneath them while you exercise.

, Whether you run or bike, taking it a little bit slower can help your body keep itself cool while you exercise. Pushing yourself too hard or too fast can cause you to heat up too fast.


During the hotter months, plan to do easier workouts, ones that don't require maximal effort and go for a shorter time period.For example, if you normally run a 9 minute mile, consider taking it a little slower and run at a 10 or an 11 minute mile.
Since you're in shape, taking it slower won't raise your heart rate as much and your body won't heat up as much.
If you do need to push it harder or go faster, try to go indoors or in the early hours of the day. This way, you can keep a little cooler.

, In addition to taking it slower, you may find that you need to take more breaks during the summer. If you're getting too hot, slow down or stop for a bit.If you're outside in the heat and are feeling a little too hot, take a quick break from your exercise.
Try to rest underneath a tree or in a shady area to help your body cool down faster.
Or, you can try dumping some cold water on your head and face to help cool you off a little faster as well. Make sure you always have plenty of water to stay hydrated.

, Some days may just be too hot to exercise. So instead of forcing a sweaty outdoor workout, hit the gym for an indoor aerobics class.Check out your local gym fitness class schedule. Find a class or two that will work with your timeline so that you can still get in a great workout without overheating in the hot sun.
You may also want to correlate gym classes with the weather. The days that are going to be overly hot, you can check out the gym schedule so you can plan ahead.
If you don't like any of the aerobic classes, use the cardio equipment instead. Spend some time on the treadmill, elliptical or stair climber. It's a great alternative.

, Nothing is more cooling than a nice swim. Whether you go to an indoor or outdoor pool, this is a great way to stay cool and get in a good workout.


If you enjoy swimming, consider going more often during the hotter months of the summer.Think about joining a local pool club or a gym or fitness center that has a swimming pool.
You can go to swim laps or sign up to do a water aerobics class or even a water Zumba class.

, If you're not a fan of the water or don't belong to the gym, you can still get in a good workout. Stay indoors at your own house so you can exercise and stay cool.There are a ton of online videos (many of which are free) that you can bring up on your tablet or computer. Follow along to a cardio or strength training video right in your living room.
You can also purchase exercise DVDs. You can find ones that are cardio or strength training depending on your exercise goals.
Exercise DVDs and videos are great for those days you didn't plan ahead and realize it's way too hot to go outside.

, If it's too hot to go outside, consider staying in and hitting the stairs in your home or apartment building for a fantastic workout. Stairwells are usually cool and may be air conditioned, making them ideal for exercising on a hot day.


Keep in mind that a fall down the stairs can cause serious injury, so make sure you feel confident enough in your fitness level to tackle a stair workout.
You can walk or jog up and down the stairs, do sprints, or jump from step to step.
You can even incorporate strength training into a stair workout, from lunges to calf raises to tricep dips.

, If you want to do something a little different, skip the traditional workouts all together. Instead, spend the day indoors being active and having fun.


If the day is overly hot and you want to stay cooler, consider taking a rest day. You can do something low key or be more active inside.
For example, if you want to still be a little active, consider walking a mall or going to a museum and walking around. You're still being active, but are also inside and cool., Drinking an adequate amount of fluid is essential during the summer heat. Take extra care to drink the minimum amount or more so that you stay cooler and safe in the summer heat.


Experts recommend making sure you are fully hydrated before you even start to exercise. Hydrate your body at least two hours before you plan to work out.
Drinking adequate fluids doesn't make your body feel cooler; however, it does help your body produce sweat which is an essential cooling function.Most health professionals recommend that you drink a minimum of eight to 10 glasses of hydrating fluids each day.When you're exercising in the summer, aim for 10 –12 glasses instead.
You need higher amounts as you are sweating more often during the day and more profusely as you exercise.
Being even a little dehydrated can negatively affect your performance when exercising.

, One very important part about keeping cool is your clothing. Wearing the right type and color of clothing will help keep you cool during your summer workouts.Many manufacturers now make athletic clothing that is specifically designed for hot weather workouts.
This type of clothing wicks sweat away from your body, is lightweight and breathable.
In general, look for clothing that's white or neon in color and lightweight (like cotton). This combination is great for those hot days.

, You may be surprised to know that wearing sunscreen is a good method to keep cool. Protecting your skin is essential to staying cool during the summer.If you get burned during the summer, your skin isn't able to cool itself as it normally would.
To prevent this from happening, wear sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30. Look for products that are designed for sports or athletics and are waterproof so you won't sweat them off. They usually resist sweat and stay on a little bit better.
Also invest in a baseball hat or visor to wear. This helps keep your face in the shade and out of the sun.

, If you enjoy exercising outdoors during the summer, try to keep track of the weather. You'll have a heads up on what days will be the coolest.


Check online, on a phone app or watch the morning news to keep an eye out on the weather.
Look at the whole upcoming week. Which days are going to be the coolest? Is there a heat wave coming? Are there days where it's going to rain?
Knowing this information in advance can help you plan what days are the best to exercise. For example, a day where it's only going to be 85°F (28°C) instead of 95°F (35°C) is a better day to exercise outside.

, Even though you're doing everything to stay cool during the summer, you should still educate yourself on heat sickness.This way, if you experience any of these symptoms, you can seek the appropriate medical attention:


Headaches
Dizziness
Nausea and vomiting
Mental confusion
Feeling flushed
Rapid heartbeat
Muscle and abdominal cramps

"
Consult your doctor.,
Acknowledge that you’re starting over.,
Plan ahead and make goals.,
Stay motivated by working with a group.",How to Start a Fitness Regime After a Long Illness1," The best thing you can do when returning to exercise after being sick is to talk to your doctor about it.Depending on your illness there are probably specific things to work on and avoid. Know the effects of any medications you’re taking – like if you’re more likely to become dehydrated while exercising. Your doctor may refer you to a Physical Therapist or Occupational Therapist for professional help getting moving, depending on your needs.

Say something to your doctor like, “Now that I’m feeling better I want to start a fitness regime. Can you help me make a safe plan?”
Call your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following during exercise: chest pain or tightness, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, nausea or vomiting, irregular heartbeat, numbness in your arms, lightheadedness, faintness, you pass out, or start to sweat profusely (more than would be expected for your activity level).;
, No matter how fit you were before your illness, being sick for a while takes a toll on your body. Your muscles are weaker than before and your stamina and endurance will be lower. This is normal! Acknowledge that you’re basically starting over, like it’s your first time exercising. Prepare yourself mentally to start slow, increase your activity gradually, and be patient. Remember that you can and will get fit, it just takes time.

If you start lifting heavy weights right away, there’s a chance that your weakened muscles will get a tear, sprain, or strain.You have to rebuild your cardiovascular fitness, i.e. endurance. It’s likely your heart rate will elevate more easily now that you’ve been inactive for a while.
Your immune system has been fighting hard to overcome your illness, so if you overwork your body you’ll probably feel unwell the next day.Take it easy to avoid getting symptoms again.

, What do you want to be able to do again – run a marathon, go back to aerobics class, play a sport? If you make goals and write them down, you're more likely to achieve them.


Keep a workout journal to help you stay motivated. Write down your main goal, and then smaller goals for one week, two weeks, and one month. For instance, if your main goal is, “Run a marathon in a year,” don’t expect to start running 10 miles this week. Increase your goals gradually, starting with something like “Week 1: Walk for 30 minutes a day” and working up to “6 months: Run 10 miles 2-3 times per week.” Start as big or as small as is safe and comfortable for you.
Be realistic and specific in your goals. “Walk 30 minutes a day” is more specific and motivating than “do some walking.” Write down your accomplishments to see how far you’ve come.

, Getting acclimated to your fitness routine after an illness can be challenging. Try working out with a friend or family member to help you stay motivated and safe. Some hospitals, clinics, and health clubs sponsor exercise programs for patients with specific conditions – ask your doctor about availability and consider joining up so you have support."

Work out in your hotel room.,
Choose a hotel with a fitness center.,
Walk or run around your vacation destination.,
Take the stairs.",How to Stay Fit During Your Vacation2," If there’s no other way for you to get exercise, take half an hour and workout in your hotel room. You can do a variety of HIIT cardio routines and strength training exercises right in your hotel room.Try starting your routine with jumping jacks, high knees, and butt kickers. This gets your cardio going and helps you warm up.
Think about including powerful full body moves, like burpees, jump squats, and mountain climbers.
Add in strength training with pushups, squats, lunges, planks, bicycle kicks, and tricep dips.
Do each exercise for 15 to 60 seconds depending on the exercise and your fitness level. Use the stopwatch on your phone or the second hand on your watch to keep time. Keep this up for no more than 30 minutes.If you know you’ll be working out in your hotel room, you can pack resistance bands or a jump rope to use., When you book a hotel, book one with a fitness center. This gives you access to a free exercise room right where you’re staying.Hotels will provide any fitness center info on their website. If you’re booking through a third-party website, it will list a fitness center under the amenities.
Most fitness centers include at least a treadmill and a few free weights. Some include elliptical machines and stationary bikes along with weight machines.
If your hotel has a pool, use the pool to swim laps and get some aerobic exercise.

, Whether you vacation in New York, Rome, or the Amazon, you will be able to get outside and get physical activity. Use a pedometer and walk around the city, sightseeing or just enjoying being in a new environment.Bring your running shoes so you can get up early and run or get a late evening run in before bed. Run on the streets around your hotel, find a nearby trail, or drive to a local park or running spot.
If you’re using a pedometer, give yourself a daily mileage or step goal. Aim for around 10,000 steps at least. Wear it all day and try to hit your activity goals.

, When possible, take the stairs. This can be in your hotel, tourist attractions, museums, stores, or anywhere else.Avoid elevators and escalators. Instead, make it a fun goal for your family to tackle the stairs each time you can.

Go in with a plan.,
Enjoy splurge foods in moderation.,
Make healthy decisions at meals.,
Pack your own food.,
Plan ahead with your snacks.,
Eat local fruits and vegetables.,
Drink water.,
Research restaurants.,
Beware liquid calories.,
Make smart decisions at the airport.",How to Stay Fit During Your Vacation3," Keep your breakfasts and snacks between meals consistent and do your best to control portions for lunch and dinner, since those meals tend to be more variable. Healthy snacks can keep you from overindulging during mealtime., Everyone wants to enjoy eating on vacation. You probably want to try local foods, good restaurants, and even better desserts. This is fine. The key is moderation.Think about where you’re going to be spending your calories. Maybe you want to splurge for dinner. If that’s the case, eat a healthy breakfast or lunch. Allow yourself some splurge calories every day and adjust accordingly.
Think about sharing portions. If you get baked goods, share with your family or friends instead of eating one yourself. If you want to try everything on the menu, share the entrees amongst your group.
Order smaller sizes. Instead of a large gelato, order a small one. Eat part of your danish one day and save the rest for the next.
Remember portion control. Allowing yourself to enjoy food but thinking about the amount you are eating can help you refrain from overeating. If you want to try the cake, eat a few bites instead of a whole piece.

, You can enjoy local cuisine and restaurants without giving up your health. Include salads, fruit, or vegetables into each meal, especially if you are going to splurge on an item. Skip fast food places and choose healthier restaurants when possible.Skip the heavy, unhealthy breakfast foods at hotel continental breakfasts. Don’t eat the waffles, the prepackaged pastries, and the sugar-filled cereals and yogurts. Instead, go for healthier options, like non-sugary cereals, multigrain bagels, and fruit.
Go for a light lunch. Dinner is where most people want to enjoy and splurge on vacation, so eat a healthy lunch. Choose salads and sandwiches, and skip the fries and chips in favor of fruit and vegetables.
Modify your menu choices. Go for grilled instead of fried, skip calorie- and fat-heavy dressings, and ask for things without butter. Get vegetables instead of fries or potatoes. Choose marinara sauces over cream sauces.Think about using your calories on what really matters to you. If you really want to eat dessert, go healthier at your meal.

, Instead of eating out for every meal, consider buying your own ingredients and preparing them in your hotel room. Many hotel rooms have a mini fridge or microwave, or you can bring your own cooler. If you don’t have these things, buy non-perishable items to eat. This can save you calories, fat, and money.You can buy breakfast foods like cereal, instant oatmeal, English muffins, or low-sugar yogurt for healthy breakfasts.
Lunch is easy to pack yourself. Buy lunch meat, bread or pita pockets, or peanut butter for sandwiches. Get some carrot sticks, celery sticks, cheese sticks, apples, bananas, pears, or even avocado to go with it.
You might even try healthy microwavable meals. If you know you’re going to be at the hotel for lunch or dinner, heat something up while relaxing in front of the TV instead of going out.

, Don’t wait until you’re starving to grab a snack at the first corner store you find. Plan ahead by bringing your snacks with you. This keeps you from making bad choice due to hunger.Granola bars, protein bars, jerky, nuts, string cheese, carrot sticks, apples, and bananas all make great on-the-go healthy snacks.
You don’t have to pack the snacks with you if you fly. Find a grocery store when you first arrive and buy snacks for your trip to keep with you.

, Odds are, if you’re going to a different region or country, there will be fruits and vegetables you have never eaten before. Visit a local farmer’s market, roadside stand, or grocery store to see what fruits and vegetables the area offers.Some places are known for their region specific produce. Try a local Washington apple, muscadines from Georgia, or Maine blueberries. If you’re going somewhere tropical, buy a fresh local mango, pineapple, or banana.
See if you can go fruit or vegetable picking. Visit apple or peach orchards, vineyards, blueberry, strawberry, or raspberry patches, or local farms. Not only will get local fresh food, but you’ll get exercise, too.

, Staying hydrated is extremely important when traveling. Bring a bottle of water with you and keep it full. You need to stay hydrated if you are doing a lot of outdoor activity or sweating a lot.People often forget to drink water and stay hydrated when stepping outside their normal routine.
Choose water over sugary, calorie-heavy drinks. Not only will it keep you fit and on track, but it will keep you hydrated and safe from sugar spikes.
Buy drinks at the grocery store and keep them in your hotel room. Pack them every day instead of stopping at stores. Not only will this help reduce temptation of bad beverages, and even foods, you may see in the store, but it will also save you money.

, Before you go out to eat, do some research. Look online at which restaurants are available. Look at menus beforehand, including calorie and fat content if this information is available. Make a choice about what you want to have before you even get there to avoid temptation or impulse decisions.Consider looking for healthier restaurants, like local organic places. Read about the restaurants and find local Mexican restaurants that use all locally produced fresh ingredients or an organic, vegan Asian place.

, Sometimes when you go on vacation, you want to indulge in a margarita or another alcoholic beverage. Be aware that fruity alcoholic drinks are loaded with sugar and calories. Take this into consideration when you are thinking about having a drink.There’s nothing wrong with having a drink, but think about what else you are eating that day. If you want to indulge in a piña colada while sitting on the beach, adjust your diet accordingly for the rest of the day. Eat healthier at your meals and skip dessert in favor of your drink.

, Airports can get you off your fitness track more than your vacation. They’re full of junk food for snacks and meals. Instead of giving in, make smart choices to stay on track.Pack your own snacks for the plane ride. Granola bars, fruit, nuts, and jerky make easy snacks for planes.
Eat your meal before you get to the airport. If the scheduling doesn’t permit that, make healthy choices at airport restaurants, like salads, grilled meats, or sandwiches. You may also pack your own sandwiches to eat while you wait.
Bring an empty water bottle into the airport. Airport terminals have water fountains so you can fill it. That keeps you away from sugary drinks and saves you money.
If you have to wait a long time for your flight, get some physical activity in by walking up and down the terminal. A good 15 to 30 minutes of physical activity will keep you moving and fit.

Stay hydrated while exercising.,
Start your fitness regime with walking.,
Listen to your body.,
Begin your regime with a warm-up.,
Include stretching or flexibility exercises in your routine.,
Increase your cardio.,
Exercise large muscle groups for a full-body workout.",How to Start a Fitness Regime After a Long Illness2," Drink plenty of fluids to help your body sweat and maintain a normal body temperature, so you avoid heat stress and dehydration. Take a break every 20 minutes during exercise to drink some water, even if you don’t feel thirsty.If your doctor has told you to limit fluids because of a health condition, be sure to ask them about staying hydrated during fitness activities.
Some medications affect your body's ability to stay hydrated and cool, such as some to treat high blood pressure and heart problems (beta blockers, diuretics), allergy symptoms (antihistamines), anxiety (tranquilizers), and psychiatric symptoms such as delusions (antipsychotics)., Walking is one of the safest activities to get your muscles and joints used to being active again. Take a walk every day, and don’t worry if you start slowly – even 5 minutes is a good start. Try to increase how far you walk every day.


Get an inexpensive pedometer to measure how many steps you take. The goal for healthy adults is 10,000 steps every day.From whatever is your starting point, try to increase it 500 steps more every day until you can do 10,000 steps with no pain or discomfort.

, If a 30 minute walk leaves you feeling exhausted, that’s okay! Cut it down to 15 minutes until that feels comfortable, then increase it. Everyone recovers at different speeds. Push yourself to be slightly outside your comfort zone, without being in pain or having symptoms return.

If you’ve had a severe illness, even walking may seem like a challenge. The idea is to start small, even extremely small, like getting up to use the bathroom or make a meal. Then slowly and gradually increase your activity each day.

, Even at the best of times, do not jump into full workout mode without a warm-up. This is especially important now that you’re rebuilding strength and endurance. Start each fitness regime with at least 2-3 minutes of warm-up exercises like shoulder shrugs, toe taps, marching in place, knee lifts or leg lifts, and lifting your arms over your head., Flexibility is an important part of overall fitness, just like strength and endurance.Start your day with 10-15 minutes of stretching. Breathe slowly and deeply while your stretch, and hold each stretch for at least 30 seconds.


Try to get one of the many phone apps that lead you through various stretches, like Stretching Programs for Android or Stretching Sworkit for iPhone.
When you’re ready, you can also replace one or two of your weekly workouts with an easy to moderate yoga session, which both stretches and gently strengthens muscles.

, Once you’ve eased back into activity, start working on cardio exercises. Leave strength training for later. Do aerobic exercises like jogging, swimming, the elliptical machine, bike riding – whatever increases your heart rate and breathing rate and gets you to break a sweat.When you’re ready to work on cardio, aim to do 50% of your pre-sickness activity and go from there.For example, if you used to do a 10 mile bike ride, start with 5 miles. Pay attention to your body, and increase or decrease that distance as you need to.
Once 50% feels good, increase your workout to 60% of your previous activity, then 70%, and so on. Don’t jump back to a full 100% effort as soon as 50% feels comfortable; this will probably be too intense., Once you’ve improved your cardiovascular fitness, you can start working on strength training. To improve your overall strength and get your whole body back to being fit, exercise large muscle groups such as your thighs, back, chest, and abdomen (stomach muscles).Use resistance bands or weights to strengthen these muscles. Do sets of exercises with the heaviest weight you can use safely, even if that starts out being very light. Increase your weights weekly a little at a time. Have a professional show you the proper form for the following exercises:Squats
Deadlifts
Military press
Bench press

Barbell rows (while bent over)
Pull-ups
Chin Ups
Dips
Calf raises
Plank

Take inventory of your body.,
Ask about whether you have any range of motion restrictions.,
Try swimming if you have joint problems.,
Be active if you’ve survived cancer.,
Take it really slow if you’ve had a cardiac event.,
Monitor your blood sugar if you have diabetes.",How to Start a Fitness Regime After a Long Illness3," What activities are safe and beneficial for you will depend on what illness you’ve recovered from and what your health status is. If you’re getting back to working out after an extensive knee surgery but are otherwise healthy, you’ll want to do different activities than if you’ve been bedridden for 6 months. When in doubt, ask your doctor what your limitations should be., The range of motion of a joint is how far in what directions a joint can move, and this should sometimes be limited after surgery. For instance, after shoulder surgery your doctor or physical therapist may advise you that you need to avoid reaching overhead until you’re healed. Be sure you understand what movements are safe for you to do before you start exercising., Swimming is a non-weight bearing cardiovascular exercise – in other words, it gets your heart rate up for a good workout without putting stress on your joints. If you’re recovering from knee, hip, or shoulder surgery, swimming can be a great way to start. Swimming and aqua aerobics are also beneficial exercises if you have arthritis or problems with balance like after a stroke.For painful joints, also do isometric exercises of the surrounding muscles. Isometric exercises are those that tighten and release the muscle, which makes it stronger. For instance, if your knee is weak or painful, work to strengthen your quadriceps muscles.

, The American Cancer Society recommends that those living disease-free or with stable disease exercise regularly. Numerous studies have shown that exercise not only improves wellbeing, mental health, strength, and physical wellness, it may decrease recurrence rates in some types of cancer. Make a goal to exercise for 150 minutes each week or longer, and do strength training 2 days each week.Always consult your doctor or care team before starting an exercise program.
Cancer survivors have some specific needs and limitations during exercise. For instance, chlorinated pools may irritate skin if you’ve had radiation therapy, using heavy weights may be unsafe if you’ve had cancer in your bones, and you risk falling if you have numbness in your feet and use a treadmill.Making a plan with your care team is the safest way to start a fitness program.

, It’s natural to wonder whether it’s safe to exercise after having a heart attack or heart surgery. You can, and should – just start very slowly. Begin with 2 to 5 minutes of walking the first week, repeating it a few times during the day if you can. Increase that by 5 minutes each week. Set a goal to be able to do 15 to 20 minutes of light exercise per session by the fourth to sixth week of your recovery.It’s very important that you also do cardiac rehabilitation sessions, which are specifically designed for heart patients. A cardiac rehab professional will assess you and advise you on how best to advance your activity level., Physical activity decreases your blood sugar, so if you have diabetes or are recovering from an illness that has affected your pancreas you should check your blood sugar before exercising. Some medications also affect blood sugar, especially insulin and diabetes medicine – though others have this as a side effect.Talk to your doctor about exercising if blood sugar is a concern, and always have a snack on hand while working out in case your blood sugar drops.

Take a brisk walk.,
Swim.,
Try a stationary bicycle indoors.",How to Stay Active with Neuropathy1," Walk outside or on a treadmill. If you haven’t been very active, start out by walking for five to ten minutes per day. Gradually increase your time by adding five minutes to your walk each week. Ideally, you want to walk for 30 minutes a day, three to five times per week.Alternatively, you can break up your 30 minute walks into increments of 10, for example, walk for 10 minutes after each meal.
Make sure to use a cane, walking stick, or walker when you walk if you do not have good balance.;
, Swimming is great for neuropathic patients because it is very low impact, helps control swelling, and regulates blood pressure. Falls are also less of a concern because of the water, so it is safer to do vigorous exercise. It’s an exercise that involves many muscle groups without putting too much strain on the joints. Patients whose pain prevents them from walking or cycling can choose swimming as an alternative.Swim for 30 minutes, three to five times a week.
Water aerobic classes are also great. Find one at your local gym.

, Stationary bicycles are also low impact exercises that are easy on the joints. You can either purchase a stationary bike, or get a gym membership. Bike for 30 minutes, two to three times per week.Stationary bikes cost around $100 to $250. Alternatively, you can purchase a mini exercise bike for $30.

Look into group classes.,
Try yoga.,
Ride a bike.,
Try water aerobics.,
Recognize signs of overexertion.",How to Start a Workout Routine if You're Overweight1," As with any major lifestyle change, it is important to consult your doctor before beginning an exercise regimen. Your doctor can provide guidance as to which exercises to try, how often to workout, and what signs of overexertion to watch out for., Walking is excellent place to begin your fitness journey. It can be done almost anywhere with little equipment (just shoes), and it can vary widely in length and intensity. Begin by walking just 15 to 20 minutes a day. After a week or two, increase this length to 30 minutes.You can continue adding length to your walks as you get comfortable.
You can increase the intensity by hiking on trails or taking routes with more hills.
Consider purchasing a good pair of walking shoes.
You may want to use a pedometer, fitness tracker, or smartphone app to track distances.

, There are a wide variety of group exercise classes, spanning both cardio classes (such as zumba or step aerobics) or more strength-focused classes (sometimes called “butts and guts” or “core.”) These classes, usually found at local gyms and fitness centers, can be fun and motivating.Look for classes that are considered beginner level.
Consider going to speak to the instructor ahead of time to explain that you are just starting out. They can offer you modifications and/or extra assistance.

, Another gentle way to start moving is to try your hand at yoga. Yoga can help to gently stretch and strengthen your muscles, while improving your posture as well. Look for a yoga studio in your area, and seek out beginner-level classes. Also, yoga classes titled “therapeutic,” “yin yoga,” or “restorative” will focus more on releasing tight muscles, while classes called “vinyasa” or “hatha” tend to be more vigorous.Once again, consider speaking to the instructor ahead of time. They will usually be happy to help accommodate you.

, Bike riding is a fun, low-impact way to burn calories and improve your cardiovascular ability. Plus, just like walking, it is easy to start small and build up. Seek out bike trails in your area or hit the streets!, Water aerobics is another great place to start because it provides an excellent workout while minimizing impact on the joints. Water aerobics is just what it sounds like: dancing and doing other calisthenic movements while partially submerged in water (or wearing a floatation belt). Look for water aerobics classes in your area., Anytime you workout, you must take care not to overdo it. Your heart rate should rise and you should sweat, but chest pains or dizziness could be a sign that you're in danger. If you experience the following symptoms, stop exercising and possibly seek medical attention:


Vomiting.
Severe dizziness.
Severe pain.
Chest pain or heart pounding that doesn’t cease.

Reward yourself.",How to Start Exercising Again," Especially if you want to start exercising again after a recent injury or other health issue, you need to get approval from your doctor before you start any new exercise regimen.Even if you're starting small with a basic activity such as walking, your doctor may want to give you some limitations or restrictions.
Your doctor also may have some advice for you on what types of exercise would most benefit you or how you can get started.;
, How you start exercising again will depend on how physically fit you currently are and how long it's been since you exercised regularly. If you've been out of the habit of exercising for awhile, your strength and flexibility may have deteriorated.You also need to take into account any recent injuries or health problems you've had, as these may require more substantial rehabilitation before you get into exercising on your own.
You may want to go to a local gym or fitness center and talk to a trainer there about doing a fitness assessment. They can help you design a program that will work best for you.

, Particularly if you haven't worked out in awhile, you don't want to overdo it when you're trying to get back in the habit of exercising on a regular basis. If all you can reasonably commit to at the start is five minutes a day, do that.Even the smallest period of time exercising is better than nothing, and will help you get back in the habit and mindset of exercising on a regular basis.
If you start at five minutes, increase that time to 10 minutes after a week or two, then 15 minutes a week or two after that. Gradually increase your workout time until you can workout for 30 minutes to an hour three to five days a week.

, Particularly if you haven't worked out in awhile, going for a walk can be a good way to start exercising again. The benefit of walking is that it's free, doesn't require any special equipment, and can be done anywhere.At the start, look for a place to walk that's relatively flat. Dress comfortably and drink lots of water to stay hydrated.
Keep your walks short in the beginning, gradually increasing the distance or time that you're walking. Walking with a friend can make it more fun.
Don't overdo it. At most, you should be walking at a moderate intensity – meaning you have the ability to carry on a conversation with someone. If you're gasping for breath or have any physical pain, stop walking and consult your health care provider.

, A diary helps you track your progress and manage your routine so you can build up the duration of your workouts over time. It also gives you the opportunity to reflect on how you felt during and after each exercise session.If you know you're required to make a diary entry, it adds an extra layer of commitment to the exercise process. It can provide some negative reinforcement on days you feel like skipping exercise.
Reading back over a diary every few weeks can give you a fresh perspective on your exercise as well as help you see patterns or issues you wouldn't have noticed otherwise.

, Most gyms and fitness centers offer 30-day challenges, which can be a great way to jumpstart your renewed exercise program. These challenges are particularly good if you're still relatively fit and didn't take a long break from exercise.If you took a break from exercise because of a physical injury or health issue, a 30-day challenge may be too intense for you. Get information about the program you want to do and present it to your health care provider first.
Be honest with the trainer running the challenge about how long it's been since you've exercised and what your concerns are in starting exercise again. They can tell you if their program is right for you.

, Especially if you're starting exercise again after a longer period of inactivity, establishing a regular schedule will help the activity become habitual. Find a time of day when you have the time to work out and make it a part of your routine.Often the easiest time to get a workout in is right after you wake up in the morning. If you don't leave much time between waking up and heading out to work or school, try to wake up a half hour or hour earlier. Do that for a few days to get used to it before you add your exercise into the mix.
Whatever time of day you choose, make sure you're able to work out at that time every day of the week. If your schedule varies, this might be difficult for you, but it's easier to establish a routine if you always work out at the same time of day.

, If you get everything you need for your exercise session ready the night before and set it out, it can serve as a trigger for you to get going. When everything's ready to go, you've eliminated at least one excuse to skip a workout for the day.Even if your exercise simply consists of going for a morning walk, lay out your clothes the night before and set your walking shoes by the front door.
You can also set an alarm or reminder on your phone. Type in a motivational phrase or quote to inspire you to get moving.

, Especially if you're coming off a period of inactivity, a good warm up is crucial to prevent pain and injury. Before every workout, spend five to ten minutes moving to get the blood pumping to your muscles.Dynamic stretches such as arm swings or walking lunges are a good warm up, especially if you've decided to start walking or some other light cardio such as cycling.
You also can do a slower, lighter version of whatever exercise you plan to do. For example, if you're jogging you might warm up by walking for 10 minutes. Or if you're doing strength training, start out with a few bodyweight exercises.

, If you've been inactive for awhile, your muscles and joints are probably tight and stiff. Doing an activity such as yoga can loosen up your muscles and joints so other exercise is more beneficial.If you've never practiced yoga before, you will definitely want to start with a beginner's class at a yoga studio so you can make sure you're doing the poses correctly. Bad form can lead to injury.
There are plenty of yoga videos available online for free. If you're a more experienced practitioner, find a variety of routines that you can do in the comfort of your own home. However, if you are a beginner, then you should start by going to a class to ensure that you are doing the exercises properly and so that the instructor can help you with your form.

, A brisk walk or 20 minutes on a treadmill or stationary bike will boost your cardiovascular strength and increase your overall fitness. When you're just starting to exercise again, you may have to build up to this time.Ultimately you want to get in at least 20 minutes of cardio exercise two to three days a week, and work up to 150 minutes of moderate cardio or 75 minutes of vigorous cardio every week.
If you stopped exercising because of an injury or other health issue, you may want to find a relatively low-impact cardio exercise, such as cycling. You also might consider doing water aerobics.

, Your exercise regimen needs three elements: flexibility, cardio, and strength training. However, if you're just starting to exercise again after a period of inactivity, build your flexibility and cardio before you bring strength training into the mix.Typically you'll want to maintain your flexibility and cardio routine for at least a couple of weeks before you start doing any strength training.
Take a rest day after your strength training sessions to allow your body to fully recover.

, After a period of inactivity, allow your body to adjust to the new demands you're putting on it. Especially if you were previously very active, it can be all too easy to overdo it when you start exercising again after some time off.Be careful not to put too many demands on your body. While it's normal to be sore after a good workout, you shouldn't be so sore that you're unable to move the next day.
If you feel any pain during your workout, stop what you're doing and reassess or modify your workout to be more accommodating.

, Especially if you were very active before, it can be easy to get frustrated when you start exercising again and can't do the same things you could before. If you beat yourself up about your current fitness level or past mistakes, it can demotivate you.You also need to lose the ""no pain, no gain"" mentality. Being compassionate and gentle will keep exercise enjoyable so it's something you want to do, rather than feeling like punishment.
If you have a problem with negative self-talk, find a few encouraging or inspirational phrases and post them in key spots where you'll see them regularly. For example, you might tape a sign that says ""you are attractive"" to the bathroom mirror.

, Having a workout buddy means you have someone holding you accountable who is relying on you to show up for your workouts. Additionally, working out with a friend can fire up friendly competition.Working out with a friend also gives you the opportunity to socialize, since you should still be able to carry on a conversation if you're exercising at moderate intensity.
Particularly if you stopped exercising because of an injury or health problem, working out with a friend also has a safety element, since you have someone there to help you if your injury flares up or you have other difficulties.

, If you try to start exercising again and the activities you're doing are boring, you'll have little motivation to get out there and do them. Finding an activity that you genuinely enjoy will make regular exercise less of a chore.Don't forget to change it up on a regular basis. Variety will keep you interested and give you something new to look forward to.
Look into taking a class occasionally at a gym or fitness center near you to expose yourself to something new and introduce a little change into your routine.

, A realistic understanding of what to expect from exercise can be difficult, especially if you previously were at a high level of fitness. Keep in mind that you won't be back to your old self again overnight.Instead of setting a large goal, such as ""lose 50 pounds,"" set several smaller goals that you can attain in a month or two if you maintain your exercise regimen.
Meeting those goals will encourage you to keep with your exercise program. Unrealistic goals or goals that you can't attain in a short period, on the other hand, will have a demotivating effect.

, Positive reinforcement can help keep you motivated and on course with your new exercise program. Keep track of the days you complete your regimen and give yourself something small for each week you stay on track.Food typically isn't the best reward, especially if your goal is to lose weight. Instead, think of activities or experiences that make you happy. For example, you might take yourself to a movie or a concert.

Consult your doctor.,
Try cognitive therapy.,
Consider medication.",How to Stay Active with Neuropathy4," While exercises and exercise programs are beneficial for alleviating chronic pain, you must discuss them with your doctor before engaging in them. Your doctor will be able to recommend an exercise program that is tailored to your individual needs, as well as recommend safety precautions.Also discuss other pain management options with your doctor to help you stay active.

, Some patients use cognitive therapy as an alternative to medications in order to manage their pain. Psychologists trained in cognitive therapy help patients utilize their own body’s ability to increase natural chemicals, which are known to reduce pain. This is often done through relaxation and visualization techniques.A well-known psychologist at the University of Alabama, Beverly E. Thorn, has researched the benefits of cognitive therapy for managing neuropathic pain. She or her staff may be able to recommend a cognitive therapist in your area.

, Neuropathic pain is primarily treated with two classes of drugs: antidepressants and anti-seizure medications. While these medications have helped patients, sometimes the side effects are worse than the patient’s neuropathic symptoms. In severe cases, opiates are used to treat pain.With patients who have localized pain or cannot take oral medications, topical pain relieving medications, i.e., topical anesthetics, are used.
When considering medications, discuss the comorbidities, symptoms, and contraindications of each medication with your doctor. Also, take into consideration your lifestyle, history of mental health problems, and your existing medication history before choosing a medication.

Acquire equipment.,
Use a personal trainer.,
Research gyms and/or classes in your area.,
Create a schedule.,
Seek support.",How to Start a Workout Routine if You're Overweight2," You are much more likely to workout if you feel good while doing so. This means having some workout clothes that you feel comfortable wearing and a good pair of workout shoes. If you plan on doing a lot of mat work (such as yoga or core training on the floor), you may also want to invest in your own mat. Finally, don’t forget to carry a water bottle with you to stay hydrated!Purchase some flattering workout clothes at your local big box or department store.
Visit a shoe store and consult with a rep about the best shoes for your needs.

, There is really no better way to get into shape than working with a personal trainer. A personal trainer will assess your fitness level and tailor a workout plan to meet your needs. They will also stay with you while you workout, providing encouragement and feedback. Personal training services can vary widely in terms of price. Look for affordable options in your area.

, If you are interested doing some strength training, group fitness classes, or yoga classes you will need to find local gyms or studios that can accommodate you. Perform a basic internet search for gyms in your area. Visit the websites of various gyms to check prices and see what they offer. If you are looking for a specific class (such as yoga or water aerobics), search specifically for this.


Trying something new, like yoga, is always safest in the presence of an instructor.
Beware of gyms that force you into binding contracts. You will want to try different gyms/studios before committing to one for a whole year (or more).
Many gyms/studios will allow you to try a class for free.

, Maintaining a consistent, long-term fitness routine is the path toward greater health. You can help cement this change by creating a workout schedule for yourself and sticking to it. Pencil your workouts into your schedule just like you would any other appointment or meeting. Even if your workout is just going for a walk around the block, put it on your schedule and protect this time for yourself., When you have support, you are far more likely to stay on track with your fitness routine. Try to find a fitness buddy who wants to embark on this journey with you. Another option is to find support through online forums. Social media sites like Mamavation (for mothers), twit2fit, Bookieboo, and many others offer opportunities to connect with people seeking similar goals."

Start from a place of self-compassion.,
Avoid focusing on immediate results.,
Value consistency over intensity.",How to Start a Workout Routine if You're Overweight3," It may seem counterintuitive, but before you even begin your fitness routine, cut yourself some slack. If you start your fitness routine from a place of guilt, you are more likely to fail. So instead of beating yourself up, start from a place of self-compassion. Every time you show up for a workout (even just walking for 15 minutes) be grateful and proud of yourself for taking baby steps toward change. If you make a mistake or skip a day, don’t sweat it. Just try to start again., Perhaps you are embarking on this fitness journey because you want to change the way you look. However, focusing on your clothing size, weight, or reflection are short-term, temporary motivators.Instead, focus on creating a lifestyle change that will bring you better health in the long-term. Avoid weighing or measuring for the first few weeks. Instead, try to focus only on how you feel.It may help to keep a health/exercise log.
Each day, write down what activity you did.
Also, write down how you slept, your mood, and how you felt physically.

, Doing easy-to-moderate exercise every day will bring better, longer-lasting results that doing high-intensity exercise once in a while. Start a fitness routine that is easy enough for you to stick to! Establish fitness as part of your daily life. Eventually, you can push yourself harder to reach your goals, but for now, just work on getting into the groove."

Try on several pairs of shoes before purchasing.,
Test out your shoes on a similar floor to the one you exercise on.,
Read reviews of a shoe before you buy it.",How to Select the Right Footwear for Step Aerobics," Many people have variations such as flat feet, high arches, low arches, or wide feet. If this applies to you, you’ll need to choose shoes designed for your problem or variation. To find out if you have foot problems or variations, wet your foot and make a print on a brown piece of paper. Then, trace the outline of your foot.If your footprint shows the entire sole of your foot, with little to no curve on the inside, you have low arches or flat feet.
If your footprint shows only a portion of your forefoot and heel, with a narrow connection between the two, you have high arches.
If your footprint has a distinct curve along the inside, you have a neutral arch.;
, Flat feet leads to overpronation, meaning your feet roll inward. This creates extra wear on the outside heel and inside forefoot, so you’ll want a shoe with a motion-control feature., High arches lead to underpronation, meaning your feet roll outward. This creates extra wear on the outer edge of the heel and little toe., If you have neutral arches, you’ll need a shoe the right amount of support and cushioning, so choose one with a stability feature., If you do step aerobics on wood or linoleum, you need soles with very good traction. If you do your aerobics on carpet, you want a lower amount of tread so the shoe doesn't catch on the carpet pile., This is especially important if you workout at a gym. Most gyms have hardwood or linoleum flooring, and shoes with marking black soles leave streaks on the floor, so you may be asked not to use them., These are popular shoes, but they are made for straight movement and provide no lateral support, so your ankles are prone to injury. If you are unsure of whether a shoe you are looking at is for running, ask a store employee or look on the manufacturer's website., Choose a specialty sport-shoe store with a large inventory and a knowledgeable sales staff. Do an Internet search to find such a store in your area.If you choose to shop for aerobics shoes exclusively online, go to a site that has free shipping, such as Amazon's Endless website. Choose a few pairs of shoes using the above criteria. You may want to order several pairs then try them on when they arrive and send back the ones you don’t need.

, It’s a good idea to have a sales associate measure your feet in the store. This will ensure you are buying the correct size of aerobic shoes. There should be about ⅜ to ½ inch (0.95 to 1.27 cm), or about a thumb’s width, between the front of your big toes and the end of the shoe.The heel should be relatively tight, and shouldn’t slip out when you walk.
The upper part of the shoe (which goes over the top of your foot) should feel snug and secure, but not too tight.

, For aerobics, you’ll want a lightweight shoe to prevent foot fatigue. Look at the materials the shoes are made out of, and hold several pairs of aerobic shoes in your hands, one at a time, to determine which are light and which are heavy., Place one hand at the heel and the other hand at the toe of the shoe and twist. In good aerobics shoes, the front section of the shoe should twist with a small amount of resistance., You may have seen shoes with heels that seem to go out much further than your foot bed. A round outsole in front gives you extra stability during lateral, side-to-side movement, while a wide heel gives extra cushioning as you step down.Look for a firm heel counter. A heel counter is material that is put around the heel to stiffen it and give extra support to the rest of the foot bed.

, The upper is the area that covers the top of the foot. If your feet tend to get extra sweaty or smelly, look for a material that is sturdy, but breathable. Firm leather provides the best outer foot support; however, they can be more expensive, heavier, and less breathable than synthetic materials., Aerobics shoes should have insoles (the inside part your foot rests on) with enhanced cushioning. Although aerobics are low impact, you’ll want a shoe with extra shock absorption under the ball of your foot.Press on the insole with your thumb. The softer it is, the more likely it is to give you cushioning and shock absorption.
A shoe with an insole made from ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) is a good option. Gray EVA is firmer, while white EVA is softer and is best for aerobic exercise., It’s important to try on multiple pairs of shoes before deciding which ones to take home. Choose the shoe that is the most comfortable to you from the get-go. There should not be a “break-in” period.Try on aerobics shoes with athletic socks. You want to make sure they fit well with the thickness of the socks you will regularly use.

, Go to an area of the store that has similar flooring to your step aerobic environment and do some aerobic moves. Move laterally, jump, and walk around in each pair of potential shoes. See which have the best grip and the most support for your feet., Go to Amazon or Zappos and cull the reviews to look for people who use them for step aerobics. This will give you a better idea of the support and durability of the shoe.

Lock your feet into the straps.,
Get into the starting position.,
Push off the foot plate with your leg muscles.,
Lean back into a 45 degree angle.,
Practice arm isolations.,
Extend your arms while reaching your torso forward.,
Bend your knees to return to the starting position.,
Start at the right setting.,
Engage the right muscles when rowing.,
Do not move your arms and legs at the same time.,
Keep your back straight.",How to Row on a Rowing Machine," Before you begin, make sure your feet are secured to the foot plate. To do so, use the straps provided on the machine.Pull the straps across the top of your foot. Secure them until they're tight to the point your feet do not slide around on the foot plate.;
, The starting position for rowing is known as ""the catch."" To get into the catch, bend your knees until your body is near the handle at the front of the machine. Grab the handle securely with both hands. Make sure your back is straight.Hinge forward at the hips so the torso is tilted in a forward leaning position over your legs. Keep your back as straight as you can.
Make sure to grab the handle firmly. You do not want it to slide out of your hands while you are rowing.

, When using a rowing machine, you're moving one body part at a time — start with the legs.When you push off the foot plate, you will be using your quads and glutes to extend your legs.









Do not make the mistake of using your full-body all at once during this exercise. Rowing properly means you are progressing from using your legs, then your core, then your arms in succession — not all at once in a single full-body move.
The muscles used for a rowing machine should be 60% legs, 20% core, and 20% arms/shoulders.
Keep your arms and torso in the original position.

, Once your legs are straightened out, use your core and hamstrings to lean back to a roughly 45 degree angle, keeping your spine straight.


Your core muscles keep the pelvis and upper torso locked together — this will stabilize your back, preventing movement along the spine which could lead to injury.

, Once your legs are straight and your back is tilted, you can practice including the arm movements. Your core will remain engaged, holding your torso at a 45 degree angle as you pull the handle toward your chest.









Bend your elbows in order to pull the handle towards your chest.
Pull the handle inward until it touches just below your chest.
This move will cause your latissimus dorsi to contract to stabilize the shoulder, the deltoids and triceps contract to pull the elbow back and the handle towards the sternum.

, You will now begin to return to starting position, following the reverse sequence of movement — arms, core, legs. Extend your arms from your chest, then tilt your torso forward out of the 45 degree angle.








Extend your arms first and then hinge your torso forward at the hips.

, Keep bending your knees until you're back in the original position. You should have your knees bent and your body close to the front of the machine, with your hands firmly grasped around the handle. You can now do the movement again.








Keep in mind that the movement is not a two count movement — one count out, one count in. Rowing properly is a three count movement, with one power-driven count as you extend your body out with the stroke. Returning to the catch should take two counts, which gives you time to recover for your next pull., If you work out at a gym, the rowing machine may be set to a very high or low setting when you're starting out. Make sure to check the settings before you begin rowing. If you've never rowed before, you do not want to start out on a very high setting.The higher the gear, the heavier the machine will feel as you move your body back and forth.
For beginners, a setting between three and five is recommended.

, Many people use the rowing machine to work their arms; however, you're better off using something like free weights if you're just looking for an arm workout. Remember, the rowing machine engages your legs, core, and arms. Use all these muscle groups when rowing instead of just using your arms.Concentrate mostly on your legs when moving your body back and forth on the rowing machine. Again, about 60% of your body's movement should come from your legs.
Only about 20% of your body's movement comes from your arms. The other 20% should come from your core.

, Remember that there is a specific order that you should move your body on a rowing machine. You start with your legs, then move onto your core and hamstrings, and finish with your arms and back. Make sure to row in order instead of moving your legs, arms, and core at the same time., If you hunch while rowing, you'll end up with a sore back later. Be aware of your posture through the entire rowing process. Make sure to keep your back as straight as possible during every step of the rowing movement."

Do an upper-body exercise followed by a lower-body exercise.,
Take a brief rest between supersets.,
Try alternating sets if you're overloaded by supersets.,
Combine upper-body movements with lower-body movements.",How to Shorten Your Workouts Effectively1," A superset is based on the idea of working one group of muscles and then immediately working another group of muscles. You can cut your workout time in half if you successfully incorporate supersets.For example, you might start with push-ups and immediately do a set of squats. If you wanted to lead with lower-body exercises, you might start with lunges and move directly into shoulder presses.
Typically, you must rest between sets to give your muscles time to recover. However, rest between sets isn't necessary with supersets because you're working different muscle groups.
Try to combine exercises that overlap as little as possible. Standing exercises will work your legs and core as well as your upper body, so they are less effective in supersets.
You may benefit from the advice of a certified trainer when you're first developing a superset routine. They can make sure you're doing all the exercises with correct form and not unduly harming your performance or increasing your risk of injury.;
, While the point of supersets is that you don't rest between sets, you still should take a brief rest of between 30 and 45 seconds between supersets before moving on to the next one.During your rest period, try to stay moving – even if it's simply walking in place.

, Progressive overload is a problem with supersets, and can lead to reduced performance over the course of your workout. This is especially true if you're working your muscles to fatigue.Alternating sets work much like supersets, except that you do rest between sets. For example, you might do an upper-body exercise such as shoulder presses, take a brief 30-second rest, then move to lunges. Take another brief rest after that set, then move to a different upper-body exercise.
Alternating sets can help you shorten your workout in the same way supersets can. While you're still taking a brief rest between sets, your rest period doesn't have to be as long since the next exercise you're doing primarily works a different muscle group.
The addition of a brief rest between sets reduces the chance that you'll harm your performance, as you can with supersets, and also has a lower risk of injury.
As with supersets, if you design a routine using alternating sets you want to pair exercises together that have as little overlap as possible.

, Another alternative similar to supersets is doing whole-body exercises that work out multiple muscle groups at the same time, followed by brief rests in between.Exercise machines such as rowing machines can give you a whole-body workout in a shorter period of time, enabling you to shorten your workout without losing any benefits.
You also can do compound body-weight or hand-weight exercises without needing a specific exercise machine. For example, add an arm movement such as crunching or lifting barbells while you do lunges or squats to target several muscle groups at once and shorten your workout.
Using a stability ball is another way to combine muscle groups. Since your core and lower body are constantly engaged on most stability ball exercises, you can get a good whole-body work out in a much shorter time.

Avoid distractions.",How to Shorten Your Workouts Effectively2," The drop-set technique sounds easy, but it is a very intense workout method that not only helps you save time, but can put you past any plateau you've reached in your strength training.One way to do drop sets with strength training is to perform your first set normally, remove 5 to 10 pounds, and then immediately do a second set. Then remove more weight and do a third set.
Take a brief rest, then move on to your next exercise. Depending on how many exercises you normally do, you can shorten your workout tremendously with this technique. While it normally would take you between seven and eight minutes to complete three sets, with the drop-set technique you can complete three sets in two minutes or less.
For example, if you normally do shoulder presses with 30 pounds of weight, you would do your first set with 30 pounds. Do your second set immediately after your first set, but with 20 pounds of weight. Then you would do your third set with 10 pounds.

, Working out your whole body at once is perhaps the easiest way to shorten your workouts effectively. This method is particularly beneficial if you previously had longer routines that focused on isolated muscle groups.You may want to continue doing your more focused strength training, but leave it for a day when you have more time. For example, if you have plenty of time to workout on Saturdays, but have trouble fitting it in during the week, you might do a whole-body routine on weekdays and a longer strength-training session on the weekend.
Taking a class at a gym is another way to get a whole-body workout in a shorter period of time. Look for a 15- or 20-minute high intensity class.

, If you no longer have a solid block of time during your day to work out, you can still get similar effects by splitting up your exercise into a series of micro-workouts.For example, you can do a six-minute workout using body-weight exercises. The biggest benefit of this routine is that you can do it anywhere. Start with a high-knee exercise for 20 seconds, rest 10 seconds, then do bear crawls for 20 seconds followed by a 10-second rest. Repeat that circuit three times for a three-minute workout. Then do cross mountain climbers and crab crawls, repeating the same circuit format as before to get in your full six minutes.
Doing this or similar circuits several times a day enables you to shorten your workout by spacing the time out over the course of the day. This is assuming that you can more easily find five or six minutes in between tasks during your day than you can carve out a full half-hour or 45 minutes for a dedicated workout.
Keep in mind that while micro-workouts can be great for your cardiovascular health and help you maintain your strength, they aren't a complete substitute for more extended workout sessions, and may not really help you lose weight (if that's one of your exercise goals).

, Working out with intensity won't do much to shorten your workout if your attention is repeatedly pulled from your exercise toward something else. Exercising alone, or going to the gym during non-peak hours can help you shorten your workout effectively.Working out at home rather than going to the gym at all is one way to save time. Even if you don't have weights or equipment at home, you can still do body-weight exercises and get an effective workout if you up the intensity (for example, by doing them faster).
If you're working out at a gym or around other people, you may lose time waiting for machines, finding a good space to work out, talking to others, or even waiting for a shower when you're done for the day.
Build a playlist that's exactly 15 or 20 minutes long, and use it as a timer. Wear headphones and focus on your exercises rather than anything else. If you listen to music on your phone, you may want to turn your notifications off while you're exercising.

Combine intensity with cardio to drastically shorten your workouts.,
Jog or walk in place in between strength-training exercises.,
Rest no longer than 30 seconds between intervals.,
Stay off the machines.",How to Shorten Your Workouts Effectively3," Especially during the winter months, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) is a popular alternative that allows you to exercise for a much briefer period of time.While the typical HIIT routine will still take 20 or 30 minutes, this is a significantly shorter time if you're accustomed to doing 60- to 90-minute workouts.
If you've never done HIIT before, make sure you have good lung capacity and cardiovascular strength. High-intensity training is not a workout designed for beginners.
When in doubt, you may want to take a class led by a certified and experienced trainer who will be there to help you if you get overloaded.

, Whether you're doing HIIT specifically or simply adding cardio intervals to your regular strength-training regimen, try to avoid coming to a complete stand-still during your rest periods.Doing lower-intensity cardio during rest periods is part of what makes interval training more intense and allows you to decrease the total amount of time you work out.
For example, you might do a strength-training exercise such as power squats or mountain climbers for 45 seconds, then jog or walk for a 30-second rest period. Then you would move immediately into another strength-training exercise.

, The secret to high-intensity interval training is to have very limited rests between exercises. Each set of exercises is brief, and your rest in between should also be brief.This will dramatically shorten your workout, especially if you're accustomed to doing two or three sets over 10 minutes or so, and then resting for five or six minutes between exercises.
Even if you're not doing HIIT, you can still shorten your workout by decreasing the rest period between sets.
You also can use this technique to combine several methods. For example, you might do alternating sets with a cardio interval of moderate intensity between those sets.

, One benefit of HIIT that can save you significant time is that you do body-weight exercises that you can do anywhere. This means you don't have to go to the gym, and you don't have to mess with complicated machines that can take time to set up.You can design a 20-minute body-weight workout that you can do anywhere, without having to make a trip to the gym or use any equipment.
With a 20-minute HIIT workout, you may burn anywhere from 300 to 600 calories and feel like you've been working out for over an hour.
If you decide to switch to HIIT workouts, focus on doing at least two sessions each week. Leave at least one day of rest in between sessions.

There's a difference between sanitizing and disinfecting. Wet wipes are designed to disinfect which means the chemicals used will kill germs and bacteria. This is important because you want to use a disinfectant when you may come into contact with bodily fluids like sweat or saliva.To use a wet wipe properly, make sure to wipe down the entire surface of the machine or equipment you plan to use. Let the surface dry completely before using. This will help ensure the disinfectant has proper time to work.
If your gym doesn't offer wet wipes, consider bringing your own. You can purchase a small portable and resealable pouch that's easy to carry around with you during your workout.
Do not use disinfecting wipes on your body. Rubbing these on your face, neck or arms can cause you to break out into a serious rash.;
, Some gyms offer spray bottles filled with a disinfectant solution (usually ammonia based) that you can use before and after you use equipment. However, if they do not, consider making and bringing your own.


Ammonia mixtures are usually quaternary ammonia mixed with water. This is safe to use and does a good job at getting rid of the germs on equipment.However, like wet wipes, you'll need to allow the solution to sit on the equipment for a few moments prior to wiping it down. This ensures all the germs are removed.
Be mindful when you spray down equipment. Do not spray it near outlets, plugs or machines with electric panels. Also make sure to be mindful if spraying near other members.
If your gym doesn't offer a spray solution, consider making your own. You can either purchase an ammonia cleaner at the store or make your own. Mix a 1/2 cup of ammonia to 1/2 gallon of water.
Fill a small hair spray bottle with the ammonia cleaner and toss it in your gym bag to bring with you.

, An all natural way to clean and sanitize gym equipment is a mixture of vinegar, dish soap and water. It's super easy to make (and cost effective) and is safe for you and on gym equipment.Gyms will generally not offer this vinegar and soap mixture to their clients. You'll need to make your own and fill a small spray bottle. Bring with you to the gym so you can sanitize equipment that you use.
Mix together one part of dish soap to 2 parts vinegar. You can try mixing 1 cup of soap to 2 cups of white vinegar. Any type of dish soap works. Use a scented one for a refreshing smell after cleaning.
The vinegar and soap mixture is great to use on equipment like dumbbells and resistance balls since it doesn't break down the neoprene coatings (like more industrialized cleaners and disinfectants).
This mixture is also good at deodorizing equipment too. If your yoga mat has gotten a little too much use, this is a great solution to clean and deodorize your mat.

, In addition to using cleaners that will do a good job at disinfecting gym equipment, there are some cleaners you shouldn't use. Whether they're unsafe to use or just don't work, try to avoid using:


Bleach. This is a strong disinfectant and does kill germs. However, it can be unsafe if not prepared or used properly. Plus it can ruin your clothes (or other's clothes) and can be dangerous if inhaled or allowed to sit on your skin.
Borax solution. This is a more natural cleaner, but doesn't disinfect. It can clean, but the germs will be not be killed with borax.
Baking soda. Again, a more natural form of cleaner, baking soda does not disinfect and kill germs.
Hydrogen peroxide. Straight hydrogen peroxide can cause a rash and irritation on your skin.

, Even though there is a low risk that you'll get an infection or cold from sharing the equipment at the gym, it's good manners to wipe off equipment after you use it.Before using any gym equipment (yoga mat, dumbbell or machine), thoroughly wipe down whatever part you'll come into contact with.
Spray or wipe down the equipment with your chosen disinfectant. Also wipe down the equipment after you use it as well. This isn't necessary, but just good manners and proper gym etiquette.
Items to sanitize include: yoga mats, dumbbells, kettle bells, exercise balls, cardio equipment and weight machines.

, Whenever you're cleaning gym equipment with the intent of sanitizing it, you need to make sure that you use the correct cleaning technique to kill all the germs and bacteria.


Most sanitizers and disinfectants require you to follow specific instructions in order for the bacteria to be killed and removed from your equipment.
Try to allow the sanitizer to sit on the equipment for at least 2-3 minutes. However, if you're cleaning your own personal items or home gym equipment, allow the sanitizer to sit on items for 10-30 minutes at a time. This is the best method for killing the most bacteria.
Always use the manufacturers instructions when cleaning equipment - both for the gym equipment and the sanitizer you're using.

, If you have cardio and other gym equipment at home, you'll be required to make sure you clean the entire machine yourself. This will help maintain the integrity of your equipment and make sure it continues to function as normal.


Take time on a weekly basis to clean your home gym. Dust off all weights, machines and cardio equipment that you have. Also keep wires, plugs and outlets free of dust.
Also vacuum around your equipment as well. This can help make sure there isn't any dust or debris in the surrounding areas.
You may want to clean your gym equipment a little more thoroughly than a wipe down as well. You probably need to do more thorough cleaning about once a week.

, One of the dirtiest places for germs to hide is on a yoga or fitness mat. These are usually porous and soft and can harbor a lot of bacteria. Make sure you clean these thoroughly.Consider throwing your yoga mat into the bathtub. This gives you a lot of room to clean your mat. Fill your tub up with water and soap or disinfectant. Scrub it down, rinse it and let it dry.
If it isn't too cold outside, you may want to consider spraying it down with your garden hose and a cleaner as well. You can let it air dry in the sun.
Some yoga enthusiasts wash their mat in the washing machine. Make sure you check the manufacturers instructions. This can be OK for some brands, but not all.

, There's no better defense against germs and bacteria than regular hand washing. Make sure to thoroughly wash up before you head out for home to avoid brining those germs back home with you.After you've completed your work out and you're just about to leave, stop by the bathroom to wash your hands. You want this to be the last thing you do before you leave. Don't wash your hands and then recontaminate them by touching items in the locker room, water fountain or other surface.
Make sure to follow proper hand washing techniques. Wet your hands thoroughly and then use soap to lather up. Scrub under your nails, on the tops and bottoms of your hands and your wrists for at least 20 seconds. Rinse your hands off and then dry with a paper towel or air dryer.
You may also use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Rub thoroughly on all parts of your hands for 10-20 seconds or until hands are dry.

, Another important piece to avoiding contact with germs is avoiding contact of your face. Whether it's your mouth, nose or eyes, these are openings to your body where germs can get in and make you sick.


While you're working out, try to be mindful of how often you're touching your face. You may not realize how often you're touching your face during your workout.
Spend a day really paying attention to how often you wipe sweat off your face, rub your eyes during your morning workout, or scratch your nose. Each time you do this, you're increasing the chance you contaminate yourself with germs.
It will take some time to get used to your new routine of ""no face touching."" However, you'll be better off in the long-run.

, In addition to your eyes, nose and mouth, germs can also make their way in through cuts and scrapes. Make sure that you take care of these before heading out to the gym.


If you get a cut or scrape while you're at the gym, make sure you clean and sanitize the area. Beware of blisters or friction burns that you may also get while at the gym. There's a good chance it will get contaminated with germs in a gym environment.
Thoroughly wash the cut or scrape with warm water and soap. You can also ask a staff member if they have a first aid kit with disinfectant cream as well.
Use a band-aid or bandage to completely cover the cut or scrape. No open part should be exposed. Keep the area covered until the cut is completely healed.

, Don't get fooled that the only source of germs are from other people at the gym. You also need to take care of your own personal gym items as well.


Even if you take great care in washing your hands, wiping down equipment and not touching your face you can still carry and transfer germs on your own personal items.
Items to take the time to clean regularly include: your gym towel, gym clothes, water bottle, yoga mat and sweat bands.

This will get the blood flowing and activate the muscle fibers, making them better able to handle the strain of training and recovery. Following your workout, decrease your intensity and give your body a chance to cool down and re-regulate itself.Warm muscles aren’t as easily damaged by vigorous activity. If you give your body a chance to get acclimated, you’ll never get as sore as if you skip the warm up phase.
A proper warm up will also help you avoid straining or tearing muscles during exercise.;
, Perform some basic stretches before you really begin pushing yourself. Stretching prepares the body for difficult physical tasks by lengthening muscle fibers and increasing range of motion. It may not prevent soreness entirely, but it can cut down on pain and stiffness considerably by keeping you mobile.Increased range of motion is an advantage because it makes each part of an exercise easier. If you’re not forced to struggle through the movement, you won’t accumulate as much soreness.

, Know your limits when exercising or completing difficult physical tasks. Keep high intensity movements limited to short bursts, maintain a manageable pace and take rest breaks whenever you need them. If you try to do more than you can handle, the result will invariably be severe soreness and increased risk of injury.It’s normal to think of soreness as an indicator for performance—the more sore you are the next day, the harder you must have worked. This isn’t always the case, however. If you continue to push yourself too hard, you become prone to getting hurt or burning out.
You don’t need to leave sore every time you go to the gym. In fact, this can hurt your performance over time, because you’ll be less likely to go back regularly and make consistent progress if you’re always in pain., The more you use a muscle, the better adapted to exertion it will become. Try working out the same muscle group at a moderate intensity a couple times a week. Keep the sore muscles active as you recover, even if they ache. As your level of fitness improves, so too will your ability to cope with the onset of muscle soreness caused by lactic acid.If you tend to get very sore, it probably means that your muscles aren’t yet suited for the type or intensity of work that they’re doing.
Lower the intensity of your next couple workouts as you work through lactic acid soreness., Set aside half an hour 2-3 times a week to stretch all the major muscle groups. Stretching sore muscles can be uncomfortable, but it’s a surefire way to promote blood flow. Proper circulation is essential to recovery because waste products like lactic acid are carried away and disposed of through the bloodstream.Stretching can be done from a static position (holding still) or dynamically (in motion). Both are effective at combating soreness, but dynamic stretching is better for increasing circulation.There’s no need to force a stretch, since you’ll already be in pain. Simply settle as deeply into the stretch as you comfortably can and hold it until the muscle begins to relax.

, Press delicately on tender muscles and joints to work out tension. Don’t dig in too hard, or it can really hurt. Massage works in much the same way that stretching does to speed up the recovery process by getting the blood flowing and increasing mobility in the muscle fibers. It’s also a pleasurable reward for your efforts at work or in the gym.Have a friend, coach or professional massage the sore spots that you can’t get to yourself.
Foam rollers and other self-massaging devices also work well for breaking up muscular tension., Soak for 15-30 minutes in a hot bath at the peak of lactic acid soreness. As with stretching and massaging, heat serves to improve circulation, loosen stiffness and temporarily ease the dull ache of overworked muscles. You can even try alternating hot and cold baths, as cooler temperatures help reduce inflammation and act as a natural painkiller.Baths are a better remedy for soreness than showers because the heat (or cold) is able to surround and penetrate the muscles when you’re submerged.

, Slather a menthol-based topical pain ointment, like Icy Hot, Bengay or Tiger Balm, onto the places where it hurts the most. As the menthol takes effect, it creates a cool, tingling sensation on the skin that distracts the nerves from pain and provides welcome relief. The tingling also stimulates blood flow, which you know by now is a good thing.Topical ointments offer the greatest relief when applied at the joints where the muscles connect, and where soreness is usually worst.
Just because you’re experiencing less pain doesn’t mean you’re fully recovered. Be careful not to overexert yourself while treating soreness with a topical ointment.

, It’s important to feed yourself well after any kind of intense physical exertion. Consume a diet rich in all the major macronutrients, such as fats, proteins and carbohydrates. These nutrients are used to repair damaged muscle tissues and keep your metabolism running efficiently. Think of food as the payment your body receives in return for its hard work.Foods that are high in antioxidants, such as leafy green vegetables, nuts and berries, have been shown to stave off lactic acid.Try to eat more on the days that you exercise, because that’s when your body needs the most fuel.

, Make sure that you’re fully hydrated before you begin working out, and keep drinking plenty of water during and after. Since water makes up a big percentage of the body’s tissues, all your cells need the element to function correctly. A good rule of thumb is to try to drink around 20 ounces of water for every hour of exercise you perform.If your urine is light yellow in color or clear throughout the day, it means you’re getting enough water. Dark yellow urine is a sign of dehydration., If the pain of lactic acid buildup is unbearable, swallow a couple of NSAID pain relievers (such as ibuprofen or aspirin) with a full glass of water. Pain relievers target inflammation at the source and can play a role in getting you back on your feet. Taking an aspirin won’t cure soreness itself, but soothing the pain allows you to resume movement of the sore muscles, which is good for speeding lactic acid out of your system.In general, it’s preferable to only take pain relievers as a last resort. Opt for the lowest dose you can to help with your symptoms. Using NSAIDs too frequently can cause nasty side effects like gradual muscle breakdown and intestinal bleeding, and may actually make inflammation worse.Make sure you’re not allergic to any painkillers before using them to treat muscle soreness.

, In addition to eating nourishing whole foods and drinking lots of water, you may benefit from taking certain supplements that ease soreness. Protein feeds the muscles and aids them in growth and repair. Organic extracts like curcumin have an anti-inflammatory effect that reduce swelling and sensitivity naturally.Multivitamins fortify the body and keep you healthy. Taking these supplements after a difficult workout can prevent you from getting as sore, and keep soreness from lasting as long.


Severe muscular soreness is sometimes your body’s way of telling you that it is lacking a particular nutrient.
Supplements get your body the nutrients it needs that it may not be getting enough of from food alone.

When it gets closer to summer, you'll have a few really hot days pop up all of a sudden. Instead of going for a long run or doing speed work on these days, do an easier workout.
When you start noticing it's getting hot on a regular basis, start planning to get yourself acclimated to the new temperatures. This means you'll need to plan some shorter or easier workouts.It usually takes just two to three weeks for your body to get acclimated to this warmer weather. During those weeks, take time off from overly long runs, speed work or interval training.
Instead, focus on doing shorter runs, slower runs and even tempo runs. That way you're not pushing your maximum effort.;
, Plan your runs during cooler parts of the day. This will help you enjoy your daily run outdoors but keep you a little safer by avoiding the hottest parts of the day.


In general, the hottest part of the day is from about 10 am to 3 pm. During the summer months, avoid running during this time frame.The cooler parts of the day are generally early in the morning or after the sun sets in the evening. The heat of the sun's rays aren't as strong during this time.
If you normally run in the middle of the day, consider switching your routine so you can run either earlier in the morning or later in the evening. Try getting up earlier or saving your run for after dinner.
Also try to find a path that's shaded and out of the sun. Even if you do run in the mornings or evenings, shade keeps the air around you a little cooler.

, Another option to keep you safe during the summer is running inside. Although it might not be as enjoyable stuck on a treadmill or indoor track, its a bit safer on summer's hottest days.


If you run indoors, you can be almost guaranteed that the temperature will be cooler and much safer for you.
If you are training for a race or cannot miss your run for another reason, consider exercising indoors. You'll be able to keep up with you training schedule without running the risk of heat related illnesses.
Try to find a local gym with treadmills or a school or sports facility that has an indoor track. You can use either option to train and run indoors on days that are just too hot.

, Another item to keep in mind when running in the summer months is your pace. Don't be surprised if you find your normal runs are taking you a little longer than normal.


It's normal that as the temperature rises, your pace naturally slows down. When the temperature is above 55°F (13°C), your pace slows about 1-3% for every 10 degrees it rises.On a day when the temperature is in the 80s or higher (or high 20s or 30s if you go by Celsius), you might notice a significant difference in your time and pace.
Don't sweat that your runs are taking longer. And don't try to push yourself to go faster or farther. This is a natural compensation by your body and you should abide by its needs to take it a little slower.

, Hydration is of course imperative when you're running outdoors in the summer heat; however, it's not only about drinking water during your run. Keep hydrated all day for safe runs.


Before you even go out on your run during the summer months, you need to check your hydration status. It's not recommended to go out on a hot day for a run if you're already dehydrated.
If your urine is light to pale yellow, that means you're well hydrated. If it's dark yellow or tea colored, you're dehydrated.During your run, even short runs, you should carry a water bottle with you. The extra heat will require you to drink even during shorter runs.
On longer runs or runs where you're doing speed work, you may need to bring a sports drink or electrolyte beverage to stay hydrated.
After your run, you also need to refuel with liquids. Most health professionals say to let thirst guide you at this point. Drink until you feel satisfied.

, Even if you're a great athlete, you should still talk to your doctor about running during the summer months if you experience trouble breathing or other health conditions. Your doctor can can advise you as to what you should and shouldn't be doing.If you have a trainer or physical therapist, he will be well-versed in how to stay safe and hydrated during the summer months.


Talk to your doctor or trainer about your normal running schedule and routine. Ask how the heat might affect your personal health and ability to run.
Talk to your trainer about any advice she may have regarding how you should properly hydrate before, during and after your runs.
If you have a medical condition, your doctor may advise running indoors until the air quality or temperature are more appropriate for your health and body.

, Although many of summer's days can be pretty hot and/or humid, there is some variability to the weather. Keep an eye out for cooler and hotter days and plan your exercise accordingly.If you enjoy running outside, it's imperative that you pay attention to the weather forecast during the summer months (and even in very cold temperatures).
Some days it's extremely hot and there are advisories to stay indoors and not exercise outside. Other days are unusually cool and are great days to run outside.
Watch the news regularly, download a weather app, or check online to see what the next few days will be like. Plan rest days or indoor activities on days that will be overly hot and try to plan longer or harder runs on cooler days during the week.
Keep an eye on smog as well. In some cities, there are days in which smog can be an issue when it comes to the breathability of the air.

, Whether you're running, walking or biking outside, wearing the appropriate clothing can help keep you comfortable and safe.


Most health professionals will recommend that you wear light-colored clothing. White, pastels and neon colors reflect the sunlight that hits your body. Darker colors like black, brown or navy blue absorb the sun's rays and may make you feel hotter.Also, wear lightweight clothing. Heavy clothing like sweat pants, sweat shirts (even cut offs) may be too heavy and cause your body to overheat at the core.
Many athletic brands sell clothes that are specifically designed for hot weather. They're lightweight, light-colored and wick sweat away from your body.

, Regardless of how careful you are, there's always a risk for heat injury if you're exercising out in the summer heat. To make sure you address any issues quickly, listen and pay attention to your body.


There are a variety of side effects that can crop up when you overdo it on exercise in the heat. You can experience heat cramps, heat exhaustion, heat stroke and heat related fainting.
Signs and symptoms that you need to slow down and cool off include: cramps, nausea, vomiting, weakness, increased fatigue, headache, dizziness, confusion, irritability, low blood pressure, vision problems and elevated heart rate.Signs of heat stroke: feeling cool, clammy, or chilled; plus any or all of the symptoms above; and a higher-than-normal body temperature.
If you notice any of these symptoms, stop exercising immediately and seek medical attention. Drink cold fluids and get out of the heat. You may need to have someone with you to monitor your symptoms.

, Although running is a great cardiovascular exercise, incorporating some other exercises can help keep you in shape and keep you cool. Swimming is a great exercise to try during the summer as many pools are open.


You can either use an outdoor pool or go to a fitness center to use an indoor pool.
The water in the pool will help keep your body at a cooler temperature, while still allowing you to get in a good workout.You can try a variety of exercises in the pool. These include: water aerobics, swimming laps, water walking and even aqua Zumba.

, Just like the pool, the beach also offers a huge variety of exercises you can do. You'll be able to enjoy a cool beach breeze, great scenery and keep yourself in shape.


The beach offers you both the water and the sand as options for exercise. However, regardless of what choice you make, the breeze or water can keep your body a little cooler.
If you want to jump in the water, you can do laps, go surfing, or even use a skim board to work up a sweat.
If you want to skip the water, go for a walk, a slow jog or a bike ride on the sand.

, Another option for a cooler outdoor workout is going for a bike ride. Even in hotter temperatures, you can ride your bike and get a little breeze, keeping your body cooler.


Bike riding is a great aerobic exercise. It's easy on your joints and muscles, but still allows you to work up a sweat.Plus, as you bike and move, air rushes past your body and feels like a breeze. This can keep you a little cooler and more comfortable as you exercise.
Stick to a shady path without hills if you can. This will make biking a little easier and prevent you from overheating.

Recognize the characteristics of food high in trans fat.,
Understand the difference between synthetic and natural trans fat.,
Know the foods that contain natural trans fat.,
Know the foods that contain synthetic trans fat.,
Read the nutrition label and ingredient statement.",How to Recognize Trans Fats,"


Trans fat is a semi-solid or soft solid fat at room temperature. This differs from unsaturated fat, which is a liquid at room temperature, and saturated fat, which is a hard solid at room temperature. Trans fat makes fats and oils pliable. Many foods containing trans fat will be soft and pliable, giving a creamy mouth feel and smooth consistency.
Trans fat gives a crispy, more shelf-stable fried food. Many commercial fried foods are fried in oil that is high in trans fat because it is easier to work with commercially than saturated fats. It is a way to obtain the properties of saturated fat without using saturated fat. The oil will be less prone to oxidation and maintain its liquid state during storage and processing. It has a low melting point and high smoke point, which makes it ideal for frying at very high temperatures. It is a good idea to check the label of fried foods for the following to confirm trans fat in the food: trans fat content, the words partially hydrogenated, or the words fully hydrogenated.;
,


There is a chemical difference between natural and synthetic trans fats. Natural trans fats are shown to cause fewer health problems as a result. They can be processed by the body while synthetic trans fats cannot. As a result, synthetic trans fats slow metabolism and increase the risk of heart disease.

,


Foods that contain natural trans fat do so in small amounts. These foods also contain other vital nutrients and should not be cut out of the diet because they contain trans fat. It is important to recognize though in order to understand how much trans fat is actually being consumed.
The foods that naturally contain trans fat are butter, milk, cheese, beef, lamb and pork. These foods contain small amounts of trans fat and consumption should be limited, but not excluded.

,


There are many more foods containing synthetic trans fat than natural trans fat. This is because partially hydrogenated oil is a commonly used ingredient in food processing. Partially hydrogenated oil is created by adding hydrogen to oil high in unsaturated fat. It will convert the fats to trans fat and some saturated fats. This gives the oil more desirable properties, such as creamy texture and semi-solid state at room temperature while still retaining unsaturated fats. It wasn’t until the last ten years that studies began consistently confirming the negative effects of trans fat, so, for many years it was considered the healthy alternative to saturated fat.
Foods high in synthetic trans fat are partially hydrogenated oils, fried foods, cakes, icings, sweet goods, baked goods, shortening and margarine. This may not be the case for all foods of those types. Many companies are working to eliminate synthetic trans fat and reading the labels will help identify which companies have done so.

,


Trans fat is required to be labeled in many countries, including the United States and Canada. However, it is only required to be labeled if the food contains more than 0.5 g per serving; this is where trans fat labeling is tricky. Many companies will reduce the serving size to claim 0 g trans fat on the label, but there is still trans fat in the product and if more than a serving size is consumed, the consumer could be taking in quite a bit of trans fat.
Read the ingredient statement to verify trans fat. If the ingredient statement contains partially hydrogenated oil, fully hydrogenated oil, beef, butter, milk fat, high fat cheese, goat, pork or lamb then there is trans fat in the product regardless of what the nutrition facts panel states. Fully hydrogenated oil only contributes minimal trans fat. Unlike partially hydrogenated oil where trans fat is mostly yielded, fully hydrogenated oil yields mostly saturated fats.

Sit down and write out your schedule for a week at a time. Look through it and see when you could set aside some time to fit in a few runs during the week.
You might want to consider picking days when you can spend more time on your runs (like fitting in a warm-up, cool down and stretching routine) instead of squeezing it in before work.
You might want to consider using a training plan or schedule as well. You can find these from running coaches, athletic/personal trainers or from running resources like magazines or books.A training schedule will give you several weeks of runs at one time in addition to telling you how long to run, how often to run and what cross training exercises you should be doing as well.;
, Another important thing to do when restarting your runs is to go on a trial run. See how it goes and how you feel. This will determine what you can and cannot start doing.After you've set up a week or two of your running schedule, head out on your first run. This should be your trial run.
During this run, really pay extra attention to how you're feeling. How's your pace? Your do your legs feel? How is your breathing and heart rate?
If your run goes OK, that's great. You can continue with your training schedule. This doesn't mean you should advance to a faster pace or longer mileage.
However, if this run feels overly difficult or if you're overly sore afterwards, you may need to cut back on the total mileage or slow down your pace. You may have overestimated how well you would do. Cut back a little and give yourself more time to get back into the swing of things.

, Regardless of how long you're planning on running or what pace you're going to aim for, you should always start slow. It's better to be safe with a slower, shorter run, than come up with an injury after your first run back.


If you've just been released to restart running or you've found your motivation to hit the pavement, its important to harness that excitement a bit. Jumping right back into wherever you left off could cause an injury or a lot of muscle soreness.Start with just a few days a week. Also choose a shorter distance and run slower than normal. If this ends up being too easy, that's OK. You can also increase the time or length on your next run.
In general, most fitness professionals (especially running coaches) will recommend that you only increase your run length by about 1 mile (1.6 km) per week. So even if that first run is easy, don't increase by more than 1 mile in total.

, The first six to eight weeks of your new running program are key. Although you may want to run every day or run several days in a row, this isn't recommended.In general, most fitness professionals will advise you to plan to have a rest day in between days that you're running.
Rest allows your body to recover and your muscles to regenerate. This, in the long-term, will support better performance and progress.
You don't have to avoid all activity on your rest days. You can do lighter, lower impact activity like using the elliptical, swimming or cycling.

, When you restart your running program, its not only important to focus on your actual runs. You also need to build back strength in certain muscle groups to help you run more efficiently.Although total body strength training is important, focusing on working your lower body and core is essential for runners.
Having a strong core and strong leg muscles help keep you stable as you run and provide the strength you need to propel your body off the ground.
Include one to two days of strength training during the week. Focus on your core, back, quadriceps, hamstrings and glutes.

, Going slow, taking your time and scheduling in adequate rest is essential. In addition, you also need to focus on being patient and positive as you get back into running.It can be hard to restart your runs. You may find it frustrating that your pace is slower, you need to take more walking breaks or you can't run as long as you used to.
However, feeling a little setback is normal. Don't expect your body to perform exactly how it did a few weeks, months, or years ago. Be patient as your body gets used to running again and you rebuild your endurance.
Also stay positive. Your first run may go great, but your second run not so much. That's OK. Not every run (especially when you're restarting) will go well. Focus on your overall progress and performance. The occasional difficult run is normal and OK.

, When you plan your first run, run for a short distance. This may differ for everyone, but aim for the lower end of your experience.


Taking it slow overall is important. But distance is key. If you run too long, you're more likely to cause an overuse injury. Don't set yourself back with an injury right off the bat.Choose a short distance to begin with. For example, if the last run you did was 7 miles (11.2 km), aim for a 3 to 4 mile (4.8 to 6.4 km) run. If the last runs you were doing were 3 or 4 miles, aim for 1 to 2 miles (1.6 to 3.2 km).
In addition, increase your mileage slowly over the first six to eight weeks. Consider following the 10% rule. This is where you increase your total weekly mileage by 10% every week.For example, if you run 10 miles (16 km) the first week, aim for a total of 11 miles (17.7 km) the next week. This slow increase helps your body adapt to longer distances with a lower risk of injury.

, Even though you've done a lot of running the past, if you've been off for a while, pay extra attention to your form. Poor running form and posture can cause injuries.


Although there is no perfect running form that will fit everyone, there are some basics to follow and to note.For starters, make sure your body, in general, is relaxed. You don't want your neck, shoulders or arms tense. This should all be lose and relaxed.
Also focus on using a smaller stride. Over-striding and overextending your legs can cause injury and unnecessary soreness.

, Another option you can consider is joining a running group. There a variety of benefits to these groups that might help you get back into the routine of running.When you have to meet others for a workout, you're less likely to cancel your workout. This can help keep you consistent as you push through those initial stages of restarting your running routine.
Also, running with someone who is just a touch faster than you can help encourage you to work a littler harder and improve your performance faster.
Many running groups offer members a variety of options. They might meet for shorter runs during the week, longer runs on the weekends and training session or speed work as well.

, Stretching, like strength training, is essential to proper running form and recovery. Include a stretching session after every run to help prevent injury and keep your body limber.


Performing stretches after you run helps your body cool down, but also maintain or even improve on flexibility. This is essential as when you first start running again, you might feel a little tight or sore.Perform your stretches after your run and not before. Your muscles are warmed after your running and are more flexible at this time.
Aim to stretch to the point of just mild discomfort. It shouldn't be painful. Hold the stretch for at least 30 seconds and make sure not to bounce while you're stretching.
Stretches to try include: hip flexor stretch, calf stretch, quad stretch, hamstring stretch, inner thigh/grin stretch, and IT band stretch.

, When you just restart your running routine, it's important to choose different terrains — especially softer terrains. This helps lessen impact and can reduce your chance of injury.If you've taken time off due to an injury, it's a good idea to choose a softer terrain. It absorbs more of the shock of your feet hitting the pavement and makes it easier on your joints.
Also, coming back to running after a break sets you up for some initial soreness. Decrease your post-run discomfort with softer terrains.
Best options for a softer surface include: grass, dirt, a treadmill or a track. If you can, run on these for the first few weeks and then transition to asphalt if you'd like.

, Before you start back with running, make sure you check your shoes as well. If you've been off from running for a while, or just have some old shoes, you may need to replace them.


Old shoes that are worn out or don't fit well are one of the leading causes of injuries in runners.Take a look at your shoes to see if they have a lot of wear and tear. Also try to think of how long you've had them and how much use they've gotten.
It's better to be safe than sorry — you don't want to start off with any injuries. If you think it may be time for a new set of shoes, head out to a local running store and get fitted for a new shoe.

, In this careful time of restarted running, you need to take extra care to pay attention to your body and how it responds to your newly added activity. Look out for signs that tell you to slow down.


Depending on how long you took off from running, there may be some initial aches and pains from restarting activity. A little soreness or tightness is normal and to be expected when you restart exercise after a break.
However, some aches and pains may signal an injury, a need for a break or a doctor's trip.
Watch out for symptoms like: chronic, lasting ache in your joints or muscles; swelling in a joint or muscle; increase pain with continued running; and decreased strength or speed.

, If you've taken a break from your running due to an injury, your integration of a new running routine needs to be done carefully.


Your doctor or physical therapist should be dictating when you can restart running, how long you can run for, how fast you can run and how often you can run.
Follow the directions of your physicians exactly. Doing a little too much too quickly can cause you to re-injure yourself or slow down your healing process.
Also, continue with cross training and physical therapy if it has been prescribed. Just because you're allowed to run, doesn't mean you shouldn't als0 focus on exercises that are meant to help rebuild your strength.

",How to Recover from Workout Soreness,"


By working out your muscles every other day, you're giving them a chance to recover. Strength workouts daily will just continue to fatigue your muscles without any of the benefits that come from allowing muscles to heal. Either workout every other day, or do strength exercises on 1 day and aerobic exercise the next. Staggering your workouts like that will help you recover faster.;
,


Eating a snack that is high in lean protein after a workout will help give your muscles the fuel they need to recover more quickly. Egg whites, lean chicken or turkey and low-fat or skimmed milk are all high protein choices that are low in fat. Better yet, grab an ounce of raw nuts or add some beans to your salad.

,


Taking 10 minutes at the end of your workout to cool down will help your muscles recover faster. A cool down should include some walking or slow jogging, plus plenty of stretching to relax your muscles.

,


Heated wraps and pads have proven effective in reducing the pain from workout soreness, especially if it is localized. Heat wraps won't help you much if every muscle is aching. Heat has been proven to reduce inflammation and reduce the soreness.

, Taking an anti-inflammatory medicine as prescribed can aid in reducing muscle soreness. If using an over the counter product, be sure to follow the dosing guidelines.

,


A study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine reported that drinking cherry juice before and after a workout could reduce muscle soreness. Cherries have long been rumored to have beneficial effects on muscles, but this study was the first of its kind.

,


The best way to avoid intense muscle soreness after a workout is to not overdo the workout. Listen to your body; if you begin to feel soreness and muscle fatigue, then stop. The more you push your muscles, the more they will be sore and the greater the risk of causing real damage to your muscles.

Drink water regularly to replace the water lost during exercise.,

Other symptoms of dehydration include dry mouth, sticky mouth, thirst, decreased urine output, muscle weakness, dizziness and headaches.
Stay hydrated by drinking at least 2 cups (473 ml) of water 1 to 2 hours before working out. Drink 2 more cups (473 ml) 20 to 30 minutes before you start exercising. During your workout, drink 1/2 cup (118 ml) of water for every 15 minutes you exercise.;
, Gulping down large quantities of water can give you a relieved feeling; however, your body has a defense mechanism of causing vomiting if your stomach is too full. Drink water in steady sips during your workout.

, One of the largest causes of workout sickness is low blood sugar. If your body has already used up its stores of calories you may start to sweat more than usual, feel dizzy, nauseated, and pass out. The best prevention is to ensure that you eat a meal of at least 300 calories, which includes protein and carbohydrates, before your workout.


If it is not possible for you to eat a meal a few hours before you workout, then eat a small carbohydrate-based snack, such as a banana, and drink a protein shake after your workout. Carbohydrates are the fuel that is used during aerobic activity. Protein helps to rebuild the muscles after your workout.

, It is important to give your digestive system the time and energy to devote to digestion. If you do not, necessary fluids will be pulled away from your muscles and into your digestive tract.

, Although fruit and sweet drinks have high levels of sugar, they can help to raise your blood sugar to safe levels and hydrate you.

, Carbonation or even excessive shaking of a water bottle can increase the amount of gas in your stomach after you drink. Drinking from a glass produces less gas than drinking from a water bottle.

, When you do abdominal crunches, floor exercise, yoga, pilates and weightlifting it is common for people to close their eyes and focus on the movement. Open your eyes and focus on the horizon so your body can better understand the movement, just as if you were motion sick in a car.

, Controlling your breathing can help to lower your blood pressure. A sharp rise in blood pressure can create the feeling of nausea and induce vomiting.


High blood pressure is especially a problem among weight lifters. Lifting heavy weights can cause an extreme hike in blood pressure. It is important to breathe as you lift and avoid doing too much at once.

, If you draw in a big breath and bend over, your stomach can get the feeling of being too full and induce vomiting. Squat instead of bending, if you are breathing heavily.

, Overexertion often leads to exercise-induced vomiting. Prevent this by increasing your workouts incrementally, so that you stay between 70 and 85 percent of maximum heart rate.

Determine exactly what exercises will be on the test and the minimum passing requirements.


If your upcoming test is a yearly exam in school, ask the teacher for details.
If you are applying for the police department or military, ask a recruiter or look online for test specifics. All branches of the US military and many local police and fire departments list requirements for physical fitness tests online. Most fire departments in the US use the Candidate Physical Ability Test (CPAT), which includes a stair climb, hose drag, ladder raise, rescue drag, forcible entry, and a maze crawl.If your test is through your employer, see if your prospective employer contracts testing through the National Testing Network, and visit their website for information on testing and preparation.If you cannot find out what will be on the test, create a routine testing the main components of most physical fitness tests: pushups, sit-ups, pull-ups, and running.;
, In order to know if you can pass your test, you need to know what you can currently do in each of the categories that will be tested. Pretend you are taking the test today and perform each exercise. Note how close you came to the goal and how much further you need to go.


If you are not currently physically active, make sure you are healthy enough to take the test before trying to complete it. Both the American Heart Association and the American College of Sports Medicine have information online to determine if you are healthy enough.Basically, you should not have any pain in your chest, shoulder, or neck while you are exercising or immediately afterwards. If you do, talk to a doctor first. You should also talk to a doctor if you have a heart condition, get dizzy enough to lose consciousness, or get extremely out of breath after exercising only a little bit., You will need adequate time to prepare for the test. In fact, if you are going from not exercising much to a very hard physical tests, such as those for the military branches or police academies, you will likely need months to prepare. In fact, one police department recommends a 3 month training program before you take the test.Make sure your schedule and expectations are realistic and healthy. If you cannot safely meet the goals in the amount of time you have left, you may want to discuss the problem with your teacher or recruiter and ask to take the test at a later time.

, You need a day in between similar activities to let the body rest and allow muscles to rebuild.Plan to exercise six days a week, alternating between cardio on even-numbered days and strength exercises on odd-numbered days, or vice versa. Rest on day seven.If you're new to exercising regularly, you may want to start smaller. Start with four days a week and work up to more.Always consult your doctor before starting a new fitness routine.
Include time in your daily schedule for warm-up and cool-down exercises. Taking five minutes before beginning to warm up and five minutes after completing training to cool down is usually sufficient. Also, put stretching into your routine. You don't necessarily need to stretch before you exercise. You can actually do it afterwards. The point is to increase flexibility by moving through all muscle groups.Check online for available guidelines for preparing for your particular physical fitness test. The US Army, for example, publishes a pamphlet with general guidelines, nutritional information, and specific training activities.Practice types of exercises in the same order as on the test, if possible., If you work too fast at the beginning of the exercise, you may become fatigued quickly. It is more effective to maintain a steady pace throughout., While training for an upcoming test, it is extremely important to monitor what you put in your body. Avoid processed foods, especially fast foods and deep-fried items. Your daily diet should consist of 2/3 grains (mostly whole grains) and produce and 1/3 lean protein from dairy or meat.Limit fatty foods, sugar, alcohol, and caffeine.

, Workout routines are usually more effective if you have obtained the right fitness gear in preparation for improving your muscle tone and cardio. Without the right clothes, you could hinder your performance, or worse, injure yourself.Shoes are extremely important for running or any other similar aerobic exercise. Make sure to get shoes made for the specific activity you will be concentrating on. Running shoes, for example, are made differently than cross-trainers in ways that could affect your performance.
Get clothes that are comfortable, but not overly baggy or loose, since these can get caught in fitness machines or otherwise hamper your fitness regimen. Choose moisture-wicking fabrics like Coolmax, Dri-Fit, and Supplex. Don’t forget to look for socks that will keep your feet dry.

, You don’t want to push your body right before the test. Working out heavily during the three days prior to a strenuous test may reduce your performance significantly. Three days ahead of time, take a day off. The next day, do a workout, but don't make it too strenuous. For instance, take a 1 to 2 mile run instead of a full workout., You mostly need to let your muscles rest from your training the day before to avoid overexertion or muscle fatigue. However, you should do some light exercising, such as biking or walking for about 20 minutes.Instead of your regular workout, spend that time mentally preparing for your test by visualizing yourself passing with flying colors.

, Get into bed 45-60 minutes before you plan to fall asleep to decompress, especially the night before the test. Make sure to eat dinner at least two hours before bedtime every night since eating too late can disrupt sleep., Your body cannot perform its best if you are dehydrated, so drink extra fluids the week before your test. Aim for ten glasses or more of water daily. Drink 16-24 ounces with your breakfast the day of the test, and another 8 ounces 15 minutes prior., You don't want anything too heavy the night before your test, but a good meal with vegetables and lean protein will help prepare you. You should also include a complex carbohydrate.For example, eat a salad with lots of fruits and vegetables, tuna, a whole grain (like quinoa), and a light dressing the night before.
Avoid fatty foods the night before your test, especially.

, You should wake up at least 3 hours before your test begins to give yourself time to wake up and eat breakfast. You don't want to eat right before your test.Plus, you'll need time to warm up and travel to your test site. You certainly don't want to be late or rushed on the day of your test. Consider the extra time you'll need when planning the day before so you can get to bed early enough to get 8 hours of sleep.

, Include fruit and cereal or oatmeal for carbohydrates. Stick to complex carbohydrates, so that you will sustain the energy throughout the test. Also, eat a protein like egg whites or Greek yogurt. If necessary, you may also eat a small snack an hour before your test, like a handful of raisins or a few saltines.Aim for 20% or less fat, 30% protein, and 50% carbohydrates. Avoid foods high in fiber, though.
The added carbohydrates will add glycogen to your muscles to help you push yourself a little more.Stick to things you know your stomach can handle. You don't want to try new foods the morning of the test.

, Don’t drink more caffeine than you normally do, as it could just make you jittery and nauseated. Energy drinks containing lots of sugar and caffeine could cause you to crash in the middle of your test, as they contain simple sugars rather than complex carbohydrates., Warming up before a physical test is essential because it gets your blood flowing. A warmup's purpose is what it sounds like. The task is to literally move your muscles from being ""cold"" to being warmer. If you try to go from standing to hard exertion without warming up, you could seriously injure yourself.The best warmups are light exercises that don't cause you to exert yourself too much. For example, walking, swimming, or biking for about 5 minutes is all you need to warm up.

, Warming up is very different from stretching. If you've been stretching throughout your preparation for your test, you should skip the stretching before your test. Even though it's counter-intuitive, stretching can actually decrease your performance if you do it right before a major event like a physical fitness test., With your adrenaline pumping, you may be tempted to take off much faster than you normally do. Check yourself, and make sure you set a steady pace so you don't tire yourself out halfway through the test."

If you find that you are chronically tired and exhausted--physically or mentally--the problem may be that you are burning more calories than you are taking in.;
, Over exercising quickly depletes many of your body's nutrients and replenishing them becomes difficult. Without the proper nutrients fueling your body, you may end up feeling overly anxious, irritable and depressed.

, Your muscles need time to repair themselves after a workout session. If you are working yourself too hard, you aren't giving your muscles the necessary time for regeneration. As a result, your muscles will actually grow weaker, resulting in decreased performance. This will be more noticeable in endurance-based activities, such as running and swimming.

, Muscle soreness is an indicator that your muscles are repairing themselves. If you're experience muscle soreness that lasts for days after your exercise session, your body may be telling you that you need less exercise and more rest.

, When your body is in a state of overload, your sleeping patterns and rhythms are thrown off. This has the potential to be very dangerous, as you need sleep in order for your body to repair itself after exercising. If you are experiencing exercise-related insomnia, take a break from exercising until you return to a normal sleeping rhythm.

, There's nothing wrong with planning an exercise session or reading up on the subject for the future. However, if you find yourself obsessing over exercise to the point where you can't stop thinking about it, then you may be exercising too much.

, Exercise should be something that bolsters your social life by improving your physical and mental health. If you find yourself sacrificing elements of your life--e.g., avoiding plans with friends in order to exercise a little more--then you may be working yourself too hard.

Walk on the treadmill slowly for 5 to 10 minutes to get your heart rate up enough to stretch your muscles.;
,


Try walking briskly for 10 minutes on a treadmill after you've finished you regular routine. A cool-down exercise will loosen the muscles you've tightened throughout your exercise and lower your blood pressure.

,


Focus on your major muscle groups when stretching prior to exercising. Stretching should be a slow process; don't rush through it. When you get to the gym or before you start your main exercise, your muscles are not ready to go full force. Stretching readies your muscles. It also can prevent muscle strains or pulls.
Take the time to stretch again after your cool-down session post-workout.

,


Make an exercise blueprint that is in keeping with how in shape you are at the start. Beginning an intense workout regimen when you've been leading a sedentary lifestyle prior is not the best idea. You will experience more muscle soreness and achiness than you should and it could prevent you from continuing your plan. Create a program for yourself that increases in intensity over time.

To start, stand in waist to chest high water. The lower the water level, the less assistance you're getting from the pool and the more difficult this pose is.
Inhale and stretch your arms up and over your head. Press your palms together over your head.
At the same time, lift your right foot up and rest it either on the inside of your left shin or the inside of your left thigh. Be careful not to rest your foot on your knee joint.
Press your left thigh together with the bottom of your right foot. Look up or straight ahead and hold this position for a few deep breaths. Release and switch sides.

, If you've practiced yoga before, you know that the cobra is a common yoga pose typically done on the floor. However, you can modify this pose so it works well in a pool.Stand about 2 feet from the wall of your pool. The water level should be about chest height - so don't get in the deep end of the pool.
Place your hands gently on the side of the pool wall. Press your forearms to the side of the pool - they will be underwater.
Arch your head backwards so that your back is curved and the top of your head comes into contact with the water.
Push yourself up onto your tip toes and press your lower back towards the pool wall. However, don't touch the pool wall with your stomach.
Hold this position for a few deep breaths. Then, slowly release and come back to the starting position.

, Triangle pose is another common yoga move that you may be surprised you can do in the water. Again, this is modified so your head doesn't go beneath the surface.Stand near the pool wall - about 3 feet away from the wall. Stand in water that is about waist deep. Do not do this pose in the deep end of the pool.
Stand with the pool wall to the right side of your body. Extend your right arm straight out and hold onto the side of the pool with your right hand. Your arm should be parallel to the water.
Position your legs so they are a little wider than shoulder width apart. Your right foot should be pointing out towards the wall and the left foot should be pointing forward.
Take a deep inhale breath and sweep your left arm up and over your head until the left side of your body is curving over towards the pool wall.
Keep your left foot firmly on the pool floor. You will feel a stretch along the left side of your body.
Hold this position for a few breaths and then release. Repeat this pose on the other side.

, Aqua yoga is great for savasana pose. This relaxing and ending pose works well when you have two pool noodles to help keep your body afloat and relaxed.To start, grab two to three pool noodles. Place one noodle under your knees and another noodle or two around your shoulders. Hold the ends of these pool noodles gently in your hands.
Recline backwards so you're almost floating on your back. Your buttocks should dip down a little lower than the rest of your body.
Let your head fall backwards and float in the water. Try to relax your whole body and float silently for a few minutes. You can stay in this position as long as you'd like or until you're ready to start your day.

Look for socks with full cushion sole support.,
Pick socks with advanced materials in them that wick moisture.,
Look for a high needle count (high density).,
Notice sock sizes.,
Feel the materials used for the socks.,
Look for arch supports and Y-heel pockets.,
Find socks that can resist abrasion, or they will wear out quickly.,
Get Antimicrobial socks if you can find them.",How to Pick the Right Socks for a Marathon," This is very important, as it provides cushion every time you step, softening impact and reducing stress on the heels. For prolonged run, full cushion sole support will reduce your time to recover after the marathon and reduce joint pains after the run.;
, During the run, your feel will sweat and you want a sock that wicks moisture fast and spread out the moisture to dry faster as well as improve cooling. A good material to look out for is Coolmax.

, Denser socks wick more moisture and provide cushion for a longer period of time. They support the feet better, and they often last longer and will not have holes after the marathon.

, Just like shirts, socks come in different sizes and shapes, and though they may stretch somewhat, one-size socks often fit poorly and are a common cause of blistering. If you can feel your sock move up and down your leg, it's causing abrasion. For a Marathon, a good fitting sock in your shoe will prevent blisters from forming.

, A good pair of socks should feel good when you touch it. Soft comfortable socks will also reduce the chance of blisters.

, These allow the sock to grab the arch of the foot, giving a snug feeling. The arch support also helps prevent the sock from bunching up.

, Look for socks with reinforced heels and toes, as these are the areas that wear out the fastest.

, Abrasion do occur during the run, and when you wear your favorite pair of sneakers, there may be existing bacteria and fungi inside. As the marathon is rough on your feet, you may inevitably burst blisters formed and having these socks can prevent an infection.

Arrive early to class.,
Wear the correct clothing.,
Bring the right gear.",How to Practice Aqua Yoga2," Anytime you're going to a new fitness class, consider getting there a little early. This can help you get acquainted and be more prepared for the class.


If you've never done aqua yoga before, get to your class about 10-15 minutes early.
Use that time to get acquainted with the instructor. Let them know this is your first class and ask where the best spot is in the pool and if she has any tips for beginners.
Also use that time to set up your station or area. You'll need to have your water bottle and towel close by.
Many aqua yoga classes also use some equipment - like pool noodles and kick boards. Getting there early allows you to get all the right equipment ready at your station.

, Aqua yoga does require some specific clothing. However, it's most likely things you already own and use on a regular basis.


In general, because this class is taught in a pool, a swimsuit is the best and most appropriate attire for this class.However, if you're very uncomfortable in a swimsuit, a fitted topped and shorts are also appropriate.
Remember, that during aqua yoga, the majority of your body (especially your lower half) will be completely submerged in the pool, so there's no need to feel overly self conscious.

, Fortunately, aqua yoga doesn't require a lot of specialty equipment or yoga gear. However, there are a few things you should bring with you.


For starters, you'll definitely want to bring a towel. A large beach or pool towel is best.
Also, consider bringing an extra set of clothing. That way, after class is over, you can head to the locker room and change out of your wet suit or clothing.
Even though aqua yoga is a low intensity and low impact exercise, you will be moving for 45-60 minutes. A water bottle to help re-hydrate you is essential as well.

"
"
Talk to your doctor.,
Locate an aqua yoga facility.,
Inquire about pricing and work aqua yoga into your budget.,
Ask a friend or family member to go with you.",How to Practice Aqua Yoga3," Even though yoga, especially aqua yoga, is a low impact and low intensity exercise, it's still important to talk with your doctor about participating in this form of exercise.


Aqua yoga is specifically designed for those that cannot do exercise with any impact or raise their heart rate. In addition, its recommended for those with joint issues or pain.
If you fall into this category, you always want to make sure that your exercise routine is appropriate and safe for you.
Talk to your doctor about any health issues you're experiencing and your desire to do aqua yoga. Since it's a newer form of exercise, you may need to explain how it's done so your doctor can be an informed decision whether or not it's appropriate for you.

, Aqua yoga is only done in the pool. In order to find a class, you'll need to locate a pool or fitness club with a pool that offers this class.


If it's during the summer months, look online or in the newspaper for pools - either outdoor or indoors - that offer exercise classes. Aqua yoga may be a class that is offered.
If it's during the colder months, look for gyms, fitness centers or recreation centers that have indoor pool classes and exercise classes. They may also offer aqua yoga.
If you have a pool at your home or have access to a pool, you can perform aqua yoga alone. There are online videos and DVD's that you can watch and copy those sequences on your own.

, Like any specialty fitness class, there will most likely be a cost associated with going to an aqua aerobic class. Make sure this fits into your budget.


When you're looking into locations that offer aqua aerobics, also look into the cost of the class.
If you find a class offered at your gym, the cost of the class may be included with the cost of your gym membership. Double check to make sure.
If you need to pay a separate cost, see if the cost fits into your weekly or monthly budget. You may only be able to afford one class a week instead of 2 or 3.
In addition, look to see if there are any discounts. You may get a better deal if you're a student, military personnel or if you buy a bundled or packaged set of classes.

, If you haven't ever been to an aqua yoga class, it might feel a little intimidating to go alone. To help boost your confidence, bring someone with you.


Going to any new aerobics class may be a little intimidating to start with. You may be unsure of how the class works, the level of difficulty or if you'll be able to follow along.
In addition, since aqua yoga is in the pool, you may be feeling a little self conscious about being in more fitting clothing or wearing a bathing suit.
To help mitigate this, bring someone with you. Ask a friend or family member to sign up with you. You're more likely to go and stay consistent if you bring someone along."

Stop smoking.,
Change your diet.,
Limit alcohol and caffeine consumption.,
Lose weight.,
Sleep well the night before.,
Do not exercise before the exam.,
Skip breakfast and coffee.,
Have a glass of water.,
Dress light.,
Stay calm while getting your blood pressure taken.,
Stand up straight when your height and weight are taken.",How to Prepare for a Health Insurance Physical," If you can go three months without tobacco, you will legally be considered a non-smoker. This can bump you into a lower premium rate. Work on quitting smoking in the months leading up to your health insurance exam.


Urine tests can detect tobacco in the system, so make sure you do not use chewing tobacco, a nicotine patch, or nicotine gum in the months leading up to the exam.Talk to your family and friends about wanting to quit. You can seek support online, through Narcotics Anonymous meetings, reading materials, and other outside resources. Quitting tobacco can be very difficult due to its highly addictive nature and strong physical withdrawal symptoms. You'll need a lot of support throughout the process.Do not lie about your nicotine habits. Many people feel they can simply lie about their smoking habits and downplay how much they use cigarettes. To do so constitutes fraud and can lead to you being bumped off an insurance plan.;
, Cutting back on certain foods while incorporating others into your diet can help with blood test results. Try to eat a healthier diet in the months leading up to your exam. This can result in better cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and heart rate which can all result in a lower premium for you.


Strive for a healthy diet high in fruits, vegetables, low fat dairy, whole grains, and lean meats. Avoid sugar, processed foods, and fast foods in preparation for your exam. You want your body as healthy as possible.Avocados can be particularly helpful in preparation for an exam. They're high in monounsaturated fat, which is a heart healthy fat your body needs, and can result in your HDL cholesterol levels going up. HDL is often referred to as ""good cholesterol"" because it promotes strong overall health.Limit salt intake, as this can cause weight retention and a spike in blood pressure., Coffee and alcohol can both affect your numbers during blood work. It's best to cut out alcohol and limit caffeine intake in the weeks leading up to your exam.


Alcohol can affect the liver, an important bodily organ. Liver function is generally tested during a health insurance exam. Binge drinking the days before tests are conducted can skew numbers. If your blood work shows no alcohol in your system, this is also a plus. Heavy drinkers are prone to a number of health problems so insurance companies are likely to offer lower rates to those who don't drink or who drink in moderation.While coffee and caffeine are unlikely to cause major health problems, caffeine intake can cause a temporary spike in blood pressure. Work on cutting back on caffeine in the months leading up to your exam so you have no problem forgoing the morning cup of joe before your appointment., Even a small weight loss of 5 or 10 pounds can put you in a lower insurance bracket. Strive to take off some weight. Aim for a loss of 1 or 2 pounds a week in the months leading up to your exam can help.


Healthy weight loss requires a combination of moderate physical activity and calorie restriction. Reduce your caloric intake by about 500 calories a day and aim to engage in moderate aerobic activities, like running or jogging, for 30 to 40 minutes a day at least 3 times a week.Do not opt for fasts or crash diets, as the weight you'll lose will be mostly water weight. It will come back on quickly and your metabolism can be affected by yo-yo dieting., A lack of sleep can cause excess stress, which can affect blood pressure levels during your exam. Aim to get at least 8 to 9 hours of healthy, restful sleep the night before your exam. Try to do something to relax before bed, like taking a warm bath. Avoid electronic screens in the hours leading up to bedtime, as the blue light can stimulate brain activity that makes sleeping difficult. If you're having trouble sleeping for more than 20 minutes, get up and read a book until you begin to feel sleepy., While regular physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle, exercising before your exam can actually lead to inaccurate cholesterol readings. Try to avoid working out within the 24 hours leading up to your exam., Avoiding food or caffeine in the morning of the exam can help. Your blood pressure and any other exams or blood work required can be negatively affected by food and stimulants.


As stated, coffee can skew blood pressure readings so do not indulge in any caffeine intake until after exams are complete.
Fasting at least four hours before blood tests can yield better results. Try to schedule an exam early in the morning and have a healthy meal the night before. Then, skip breakfast and go straight to your exam., If you're not eating or drinking coffee, producing a urine sample might prove difficult. Try having a glass of water before you leave for the exam. You'll likely end up needing to urinate around the time you arrive for the exam and a urine sample is usually requested early on.

, Heavier clothing can add a few pounds to the scale. While this might not seem like a big deal, a 2 or 3 pound difference could you put you in a higher health bracket and result in higher premiums. Wear lighter clothing, and make sure to wear garments with sleeves that can easily roll up. You'll have to do so to get your blood pressure taken and to get blood drawn., If you're nervous while getting blood pressure taken, this can affect results. Try to stay calm in the waiting room as your vitals are usually the first thing a nurse or doctor will take.


If the hospital allows, see if your blood pressure can be taken after the exam itself. You may be feeling calmer then, especially if you're afraid of needles or other aspects of a doctor's office.Find ways to relax in the exam room while waiting to have your blood pressure taken. Practice deep breathing exercises, call a friend, read a book, or do a relaxing activity like a crossword puzzle.Deep, soothing breaths can also help. Breathing in through your nose and taking air down into your abdomen can lower your heart rate and blood pressure., Weight/height charts often determine insurance premiums. Slouching can cause you to lose half an inch or more when your height is taken, affecting how much it's appropriate for you to weigh. Stand up as straight as possible when doctors take your height so you can get an accurate measurement."

Try some isometric exercises.",How to Prevent Runner's Knee," Everyone has a specific running style and gait. Getting these analyzed can help you understand what you need to change or monitor when you're running.You can see a running specialist or doctor to get your gait analyzed. They'll watch you run and use specialty video to analyze where your foot falls on the ground and how it falls in relationship to the rest of your body.
Depending on your gait, your doctor or specialist may recommend a certain pair of shoes or certain inserts to help your body conform to a more efficient form and reduce risk of injury.
Your running style is a little different from your gait. Proper running form and posture can also help prevent runner’s knee. Make sure your back is straight, but you're bent over at your hips so your torso is leaning forward just a touch. Also keep your knees bent.;
, In addition to your gait and form, where you run also has an impact on your knees. Since running is a high impact exercise, certain surfaces lend themselves better to injury prevention.


As you run, your joints, especially your knees, absorb the impact from your feet hitting the ground. The harder the surface, the greater the impact and stress on the joints.
The hardest surfaces to run on (and the most likely to aggravate an injury) are: concrete and asphalt.
The softest surfaces to run on (which are easier on your joints) are: grass, dirt, a track or treadmill.

, You may not realize, but certain strength training exercises can also help prevent runner’s knee. Strengthening your lower body in particular, can help keep your leg more stable and prevent injury.Although proper form and gait are essential to injury prevention, strength training is equally important.
If you have weak hamstring or quadriceps, this can change your gait and running form without you even realizing it. This can cause your knee cap to get out of alignment much easier while you run.
Include one to two days of strength training each week. Make sure to focus on strengthening both your quadriceps and hamstrings equally during these sessions.

, If you're training for a race or just want to increase the overall distance of your runs, you'll need to be careful on how much you advance. If you increase your mileage too quickly, you're more likely to suffer from runner's knee.There is a general ""rule"" or guideline for runners regarding their mileage. It's recommended to never increase mileage more than 10% over the previous week.
For example, if you ran 5 miles 3 times last week for a total of 15 miles, don't abruptly increase to 8 miles 3 times a week. Increase your run length by 10% so your total weekly mileage is about 16 1/2 miles.
Try to follow this rule as much as you can. Sports professionals note there is a significant increase in injury rate (even when runners are feeling good) when they abruptly increase their total mileage.

, Similar to strength training, it's also important to stretch regularly. This is something that can be easily forgotten or skipped, but may also be a cause of runner's knee.Although a total body stretch is advisable, you need to focus on stretching your calves, hamstrings and quadriceps specifically.
Try to take 5 minutes after your run is completed to do a few stretches. Hold stretches for about 30 seconds and make sure not to bounce during your stretch. When stretching problem areas, you can hold your stretches for about 45 seconds.
If you're unsure of how or what to stretch, ask your doctor, personal trainer, kinesiologist, or physiotherapist. They can show you specific stretching exercises to keep your muscles flexible and improve flexibility of your knee and surrounding tendons.

, Using a foam roller can help to keep your muscles from getting too tight. You can use a roller to help stretch out the connective tissues and muscles of the upper thigh such as the quads, IT band, and hamstrings.

To use a foam roller on your quads, place the roller on the ground and position your body over it so that your quads are resting on it. You should look as if you are going to do a plank.
Allow your full weight to be on the roller and try to relax. Do not try to hold yourself up off of the roller.Then, slowly begin to roll your body forward and backwards over the roller using your arms.

, Certain terrains and specific routes may provide a good challenge and a good workout, they may also cause or aggravate a knee injury.


Consistently running hills, running up steps or on uneven terrain (like trail running), can cause unnecessary amount of stress on your knee joints (and feet and hip joints).If you find yourself going towards these types of runs, consider limiting how often you choose that route during the week. Maybe do these runs one to two days a week only.
Mix up these harder or more challenging runs with a few runs on a treadmill or on a flat surface like a track. This can help alternate days of high and low joint stress.

, Your gait can affect whether or not you're more prone to injury. It can be very difficult to change your gait, however wearing the right type of supportive shoes can help.After you have your gait analyzed, it might be recommended for you to get a new running shoe. Certain shoes can help add more arch support, provide more ankle stability or even help your foot land correctly on the ground.
If a certain type of shoe has been recommended, consider purchasing it to help prevent further injuries. All of these supports can help stabilize your knee and prevent runner's knee from occurring.
If new shoes don't totally fix your knee problems, ask your doctor about possibly getting orthotic inserts to help provide additional support.

, If you think you've injured your knee or are experiencing runner’s knee, it is important to go see the doctor. Although runner’s knee is a fairly benign issue, knee pain could signal a more serious injury.


If you're feeling a dull, chronic pain or a sharp pain that won't go away, make an appointment to go see your doctor.
Let the doctor know your training schedule. You'll need to review how often you run, how many miles and the terrain type.
In addition, it is a good idea to track your symptoms and let your doctor know when they started, the intensity and whether or not it worsens with activity.

, As much as you may not like having to stop your normal running routine, it might be in your best interest to take a break. Resting your knee from a high impact sport like running can help it make a full recovery.If you're experiencing any type of pain, it is typically recommended to take a few days off from exercising - especially high impact exercise. If your doctor has diagnosed you with runner’s knee, this will most likely be part of the treatment plan as well.
If you don't want to completely stop running, consider cutting your days back to one to two days a week. Also keep runs short and on a flat, soft terrain.
Although you may be taking a short break from your runs, this doesn't mean you can't exercise at all. Stick to low impact exercises like yoga, swimming, or water aerobics and cycling.

, If you've been experiencing knee pain, the quicker you treat it, the quicker it can resolve. One of the first things you want to do if you suspect you have runner's knee is to ice it.Icing your knee or any joint helps reduce any swelling or inflammation in that area. It can also help dull the pain in your knee.
When you're icing your knee, keep the ice wrapped in a cloth towel and apply for about 10 to 20 minutes at a time. Ice your knee until it feels numb and then take away the ice until your skin returns to its normal temperature.
Avoid heat packs or heating devices at this time.
You can use a pack of frozen peas, a gel ice pack or a bag of ice cubes. Again, make sure to wrap in a towel.

, After you've iced your knee, consider wrapping it and keeping it elevated. This also helps reduce swelling and can help improve recovery.Wrap your knee with an elastic cloth bandage, tape or compression stocking. Make sure the wrap is not too tight - you still want blood to flow evenly to this area.
When you can, also keep your wrapped knee elevated (you can ice it at this time as well). This helps prevent swelling.
Lay your lower leg on a comfortable pillow so that it's slightly elevated above heart-level while you're sitting. You may need to be in a reclined position to make this doable.

, One common symptom of runner's knee is pain. It can range from mild to severe and can also continue as a dull, chronic pain. Manage this symptom with over-the-counter (OTC) medications if needed.


Most OTC pain medications are mild and will take care of the pain associated with runner's knee.
You can take any NSAID medication like aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen. You may also want to take acetaminophen if you'd like.
Always talk to your doctor before taking OTC pain medications. Some do have interactions with certain chronic conditions and prescription medications.
If the pain is not well managed with OTC medications, call your physician right away to get your knee evaluated further.

, If you're currently dealing with runner's knee or another knee injury, it might have been recommended to take a break from running. However, you can still engage in other exercises like:


Swimming. Whether you do water walking, swim laps or take a water aerobics class, the buoyancy provided by the water makes this exercise easy on your knee.Using the elliptical. This machine is low impact as well. Make sure your knee feels comfortable while using this machine. If it still hurts, discontinue this exercise.
Cycling. Try either a recumbent bike or a stationary bike to keep up with cardio. Be careful in spin class as these are higher intensity and still may aggravate your knee.

, If you still want to run, even while having runner's knee, be smart about how much you run and where. If you overdo it, you'll most likely experience a much longer recovery time.


Many health professionals say that is OK to run even when you have an injury like runner's knee. That being said, you need to cut down on your total mileage significantly.Consider running just a few miles (3-4 or less) just a few times a week. The sooner you cut your mileage down, the sooner your knee can heal and the sooner you can get back on track.
Also consider running on a soft surface like a treadmill. This can help lessen the impact of these shorter runs.

, Although strength training exercises are great to help prevent runner’s knee, be careful with these exercises if you already have runner's knee.


Some leg exercises - like leg raises, squats or lunges - put excessive stress on your knee joint. These could aggravate a knee injury like runner's knee.
Try to do lower body strength training exercises that do not hurt your knee. If you notice pain with any type of exercise, discontinue and wait a few days.
Instead of trying lower body exercises, focus on strengthening your core and upper body as you let your knee heal.

, Isometrics are a type of static strength training exercise. You hold poses that cause your muscles to contract and this builds strength while also promoting flexibility. These exercises can improve your running and may even help to prevent running injuries.Try doing a static squat, where you squat down and hold the position for a minute or more.

Do a wall sit, where you lean against a wall and get into a sitting position. Hold the position for a minute or longer if you can.

Perform a plank, where you position your body in a straight line parallel to the ground and hold up your body weight using your forearms and toes. Hold yourself up for one minute or more and then release.

Join The National Weight Control Registry.",How to Overcome Obesity," The majority of cases of obesity are caused by diet and lifestyle choices. You gain weight when you take in more calories than you burn through daily activities – either due to having a sedentary lifestyle, eating an unhealthy diet, or both.Your doctor can help you to overcome obesity by educating you about diet and lifestyle changes, helping you to make a meal plan or exercise regimen that’s right for you, and referring you to other helpful professionals. You and your doctor can work to overcome your obesity as a team.


It’s also important to see your doctor regularly to monitor for and treat other health conditions affected by obesity, such as diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure.
Ask your doctor if any medications you take may make it harder to lose weight. Some medicines like antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, steroids, and beta-blockers (a type of heart medicine) can cause weight gain.
Consult with your doctor before starting any big changes in your diet or exercise regimen. Discuss any health conditions you have, and any medications you take, so you can approach your goals safely and effectively.;
, Nutritionists and dietitians are professionals trained to help you eat healthy in the way that’s best for you. Work with one to create a meal plan, and to ensure you get all the vitamins and minerals you need while eating to lose weight.


Often, your doctor can refer you to a nutritionist or dietitian. Tell your doctor something like, “I’d like extra help creating a healthy diet. Can you suggest someone to help me?”

, Consider hiring a personal trainer if you have the means to do so. Personal trainers can teach you how to exercise properly and safely, and can be very motivational. They can teach you appropriate form for exercises and help you to develop a consistent plan with gradually increasing levels of difficulty.


If a personal trainer is out of your price range, try joining a class at the gym or YMCA. You won’t get as much individualized attention, but you’ll still have camaraderie and support from others.

, Sometimes the best way to overcome obesity is to work with a care team. Depending on your needs and circumstances, your doctor may have you work with a mental health professional or an obesity specialist.Remember that obesity is a disorder that can be treated and conquered with the right help.

, Weight-loss medications do not replace a healthy diet and exercise, but in some situations they can be a helpful addition. You may qualify for weight-loss medications if your BMI is over 30, or is over 27 but you have related health issues. These medications don’t work for everyone, and there’s a risk you will regain some of the weight when you stop the medications – but your doctor will help you know if a medication is right for you.Some common weight-loss medications include:


Orlistat (Xenical), phentermine and topiramate (Qsymia), lorcaserin (Belviq), liraglutide (Saxenda), and buproprion/naltrexone (Contrave).

Take all medications as directed by your doctor.



, Weight-loss surgery, or bariatric surgery, limits how much food you can eat and/or how you digest and absorb food. You can have good results, but there are also risks. Surgeries can have consequences in how you absorb some vitamins and minerals that you need, so always continue to work with your healthcare provider after your surgery. There are several kinds of surgery to consider, and your doctor can help you choose one that’s right for you. You’re only eligible for surgery if you meet all of these criteria:You’ve unsuccessfully tried other methods to lose weight
You have a BMI of 40 or higher or 35-39.9 with other related health problems
You’re committed to also making diet and lifestyle changes during and after your use of medicine

, Rarely, obesity is caused by genetic or medical conditions. Discuss your health history and family history with your doctor to rule out any medical causes for your weight concerns. Talk to your doctor about getting tested if you have a family history of any of these conditions, or if you have other signs or symptoms of these conditions (though this is not a comprehensive list):Hypothyroidism (low thyroid function): some common symptoms include fatigue, feeling cold a lot, dry skin, weight gain, changes in your menstrual cycle, thin/fine hair, and depression.Cushing’s syndrome (too much cortisol in your body): symptoms include a fatty hump between your shoulder blades, changes in your menstrual cycle, a wide, round face, and purplish stretch marks.Prader-Willi syndrome: those born with this disorder feel hunger and a need to eat constantly., You and your doctor should discuss how many calories per day you should try to eat. The average goal is 1,200 to 1,500 calories per day for women, and 1,500 to 1,800 calories per day for men.Your goal is to burn more calories than you eat – that’s the only way to safely and effectively lose weight naturally.


It may help to keep a food journal. Record what you eat, how many calories you’re getting from your foods, and how many servings you’re eating. Remember that if the food label lists an item as 100 calories but you’re eating three times the serving size, that’s 300 calories.

, When possible, try to eat five to six small, healthy meals a day instead of the conventional three larger meals a day. You may feel more satiated, and you’ll be less likely to overeat.If this doesn’t fit with your schedule, focus on limiting your portion sizes during meals. Use a smaller plate, and try to fill 2/3 of your plate with vegetables, fruits, or whole grains.

, Limit calories without losing nutritional value by choosing the right foods to feel full while eating less.Some foods, like sweets and junk food, have high energy density, i.e. they contain a lot of calories in a small portion. You can eat larger servings of foods with lower energy density, like fruits and vegetables, and still limit your calories., Fresh fruits and vegetables are low in fat and calories, and contain lots of nutrients. Opt for fresh or frozen over canned – canned fruits and veggies can contain lots of salt and additives.Make the bulk of your meals with whole grains – choose whole wheat bread, rice, pasta, oats, and quinoa.


Avoid white bread and other refined sugars.
Eat a variety of vegetables – dark leafy greens, red and yellow veggies, peas and beans, and starches.Aim to eat 5-9 servings of fruits and vegetables daily.

, Bad fats are saturated fats. These are found in red meat, butter, lard, shortening, and bacon. They are solid at room temperature, and they can raise your cholesterol in your blood. Limit these in your diet as much as possible.


Cook with olive oil instead of butter; olive oil contains good fats that are better for you.
Switch red meat like beef and pork with poultry and fish; fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, and herring are good healthy options.
Choose low-fat or fat-free dairy.
Get protein from unsalted nuts, seeds, soy, and beans.

, Junk food like chips, cookies, soda, and other prepackaged items from the snack aisle contain lots of fat and sugar and quickly add to your calorie count. Limit these items in your diet as much as possible. Try to replace sugary, high-fat desserts with fresh fruit or popsicles; snack on vegetables, hummus, or nuts rather than salty snack foods.Limit eating takeout or fast food to once a week at most., Sugars add lots of calories to your daily diet, and can contribute to health problems like diabetes. Try not to eat many sweets, candies, or baked desserts. Avoid sugary drinks like soda, energy drinks, sweetened coffee and tea, and flavored water.Invigorate regular water with natural flavors like citrus slices, mint, or cucumber.

, Alcohol contains a lot of sugar and extra calories. Other than the health effects of alcohol, consuming it regularly can make it more difficult to lose weight.Limit yourself to “moderate” alcohol intake – one glass a day for women, and two for men.


If you don’t drink alcohol, don’t start.

, Any diet that promises immediate or drastic weight loss is probably either unhealthy, unrealistic, or both. Most fad or crash diets might help you lose weight quickly, but you’re almost guaranteed to put the weight back on – and in the mean time, you might be doing your body harm. The best way to lose weight is gradually and consistently to improve your health and keep the weight off., Even a 10 minute walk every day can improve your health.If you’ve been sedentary or overweight for a while, you may have to start slowly. Set small goals for yourself and build on them, such as, “I will take a 15 minute walk every day this week,” and, “I will increase my activity to 30 minutes, 5 days per week starting by the end of the month.” Once you start to consistently get exercise it will become a habit, making it easier to accomplish.

, In order to lose weight when you’re obese, you need to partake in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise each week. Try to create a workout schedule that gets you moving for 30 minutes a day, at least 5 days a week.It’s okay to start smaller and gradually work up to this goal.


For more extreme results, aim for 300 minutes per week of exercise.What counts as a “moderate-intensity aerobic workout” varies and can be quite creative: Walk briskly (fast enough to break a sweat), bike, swim, play tennis, dance, do workout videos at home – anything that gets your heart rate and breathing rate up and makes you sweat.Consult your healthcare professional about an appropriate exercise regime, especially if you have medical conditions or are over age 40 (for women) or 50 (for men).

, Other than setting aside specific time to exercise, there are easy ways to burn calories throughout your day. Walk somewhere instead of driving, park far away from your destination, work in the garden, take your dog or a neighbor’s dog for frequent walks, play music and get energetic when you’re cleaning the house, or take the stairs instead of the elevator.Turn off the TV! People who watch fewer than 2 hours of TV a day tend to gain less weight than those who watch more.Take a walk outside after dinner instead of sitting in front of the TV. If you can’t miss your favorite program, do light to moderate exercises while you watch such as squats, crunches, or jogging in place.

, A great thing about weight loss is that even small changes can improve your overall health. A normal initial goal for treating obesity is a “modest weight loss” – usually 3-5% of your total weight.For instance, if you weigh 250 lbs (114kg), you can set an initial goal of losing 7.5-12.5 lbs (3.5-5.7 kg) to start improving your health.


Losing even 5% of your body weight can reduce your risk for developing diabetes, and it may even help improve liver function.
The more weight you lose, the bigger the health benefits – but set small, attainable goals in order to stay positive and dedicated.

, You don’t have to be perfect – it’s okay to treat yourself occasionally. If you meet a weight-loss or exercise goal, reward yourself. Ideally, do something fun such as seeing that movie that’s in theatres or taking a weekend trip; but if it’s a food treat you’re craving, go for it. One fattening meal won’t impede your success, and it’s important to appreciate your hard work.

, Body mass index, or BMI, is defined by comparing your body weight in kgs to your height in meters. It’s usually a good measure of your amount of body fat. A BMI of 18-25 is considered normal, and obesity is classified into ranges of severity. Keep track of your BMI with your doctor to monitor your progress, and set health-conscious goals. BMI is categorized as follows:40 and higher: Extreme/morbid obesity (class III obesity)
35-39.9: Class II obesity
30-34.9: Class I obesity
25-29.9: Overweight
18.5-24.9: Normal/healthy

, When you don’t sleep enough or sleep too much, your body releases a hormone that can affect your appetite and make you crave carbohydrates.Maintain a healthy and consistent sleep schedule and get as close to 7-9 hours of sleep as you can.Try the following:Set regular times to go to bed and wake up.
Avoid napping during the day.
Leave your bedroom for sleeping – don’t watch TV or do other activities in bed.
Sleep in a cool, dark space.
Avoid caffeine after 4pm, or earlier if you’re sensitive to caffeine.
Create a relaxing ritual before bed, like taking a hot bath or having a cup of (decaffeinated) tea.

, Surround yourself with friends and family who encourage your goal of overcoming obesity and maintaining a healthy weight.Invite others to cook healthy meals with you. Find a “workout buddy,” and encourage each other to exercise regularly.

, The National Weight Control Registry (NWCR) is an ongoing database and investigation of people who have successfully lost weight and who are continuing to do so. This program will ask you to record your eating, health, and exercise habits by occasionally sending you questionnaires. This is a great way to help researchers understand weight loss while helping you keep track of your own habits.


To join, you must be 18 years old. You need to have lost at least 30 pounds and to have kept 30 pounds off for at least a year.
Questionnaires are sent out every two months.

Place candles inside a cupcake tin.,
Melt the wax in the oven.,
Move the wicks.,
Place a pinecone in each opening.,
Let the wax set.",How to Make Firelighters1," Place a tealight candle in each compartment of a cupcake tin.To make the firelighters easier to remove, line each compartment of the tin with a cupcake wrapper.
If the candle has any metal cases or similar pieces, remove those pieces before placing them in the tin. Leave the wick intact, but make sure that each wick stands upright.
You could use pieces of broken candle instead of tea lights, if desired. Only fill the cupcake compartment about halfway; do not fill it to the very top.;
, Place the tin of candles in your oven. Set the oven to bake at a temperature between 300 and 350 degrees Fahrenheit (150 to 180 degrees Celsius). Keep the candles inside until the wax completely melts.


The exact temperature doesn't matter, but it should be within a moderate range to help the wax melt slowly, safely, and thoroughly.

, Carefully remove the pan from the oven. Use tweezers to fish out the wicks and move them to one side of the compartment.


By moving the wicks, you will make it easier to prevent them from getting lost under the pinecones.
If you used pieces of candle that did not have a wick, add a wick to the melted wax now. Use a small piece of rope or small tube of rolled paper.

, Slowly press one pinecone into each compartment of melted wax. The wax should rise up around it, but stop pressing down before the wax overflows.


The best pinecones are those that are already open, but size does not make much difference. It is also advisable to lightly dust off as much dirt and debris as possible before using them in your firelighters.

, Once the wax cools and hardens, you should be able to remove the firelighters from the tin. Peel away the liners from the wax before using.


Keep the firelighters in sealed plastic containers until ready to use.

Place pieces of cork inside a mold.,
Add a wick to each mold.,
Pour melted wax inside.,
Allow the wax to set.",How to Make Firelighters2," Break apart a few corks and arrange the pieces inside a paper cup. The cup should only be about half full.The cork can be broken, crushed, or cut, but smaller pieces are more ideal than whole corks.
Cork is a very dry and absorbent material, which allows them to act as very effective firelighters.
If you do not want to use a paper cup, you could also use something like an ice cube tray. Just make sure that the mold is fairly small and durable enough to withstand the heat of the melted wax.

, Cut a small strip of rope and place it in the cup, wedging it in between pieces of cork. The rope should be upright.


If you don't have rope, you could make a wick by rolling a strip of flammable fabric, cardboard, or paper into a thin tube.

, Slowly pour enough melted wax into the cup to completely cover the cork. Make sure that the wick is partially submerged and partially exposed.


Candle wax works notably well.
Work carefully when handling melted wax. Liquified wax is very hot and can easily cause burns if brought into contact with the skin.

, Set the cup aside and allow the wax to completely cool. Once the wax has hardened, you should be able to peel off the paper cup.


Store the firelighters in resealable plastic bags until ready to use.

Close one end of a roll.,
Stuff the rest of the role with a flammable material.,
Pour melted wax inside the cardboard.,
Let it harden.,
Staple the other end closed.,
Consider soaking the finished product in paraffin.,
Store in an airtight container.",How to Make Firelighters3," Press one open end of a cardboard toilet paper tube closed, keeping the edge closed with one or two staples.


The cardboard should catch fire and burn well enough, so you do not need to insert a separate wick into this firelighter.
If you do not have a toilet paper tube, you could cut a cardboard paper towel core into two or three pieces and use that, instead.

, Stuff dryer lint or a similar material into the remaining opening of the tub. Fill most of the tube, leaving only 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of empty space at the top of the tube.


Dryer lint works very well as kindling because it is dry and light. It is not your only option, though. You could use sawdust, wood shavings, shredded paper, or bits of crushed and broken cork, instead.

, Slowly pour melted candle wax into the tube, using just enough to cover the contents inside.


Note that it may be easier and safer if you prop the tube upright in between two cement blocks or similarly heavy, non-flammable objects as you pour the wax.. You could even use a vice to hold the tube in place. Do not hold the tube with your hands.

, Keep the tube standing upright and undisturbed for 30 minutes or so, or until the wax completely cools and sets in place.


You should be able to tell when the wax is ready simply by peeking inside the tube. The wax should appear completely solid. If you want to double check, gently squeeze the sides of the cardboard tube. They should feel cool and solid.

, Press the remaining open end of the tube together. Keep the end sealed by stapling it in place.

, The firelighter should work well enough as it is, but if you want to cardboard to burn for a longer period of time, soak entire thing in a bit of liquid paraffin for 30 seconds.


Remove the firelighter from the paraffin and let it dry.

, Keep the cardboard firelighter in an airtight plastic container until you are ready to use it.

Dip cotton balls into petroleum jelly.,
Alternatively, dip the cotton into melted wax.,
Store the firelighters in a sealed container or bag.",How to Make Firelighters4," Rub a cotton ball into a bit of petroleum jelly. Use your fingers to work the petroleum jelly into the fibers of the cotton, thoroughly coating the entire piece.You could use a cotton makeup pad instead of a cotton ball, if desired. Either option should work well.

, Grab the cotton ball or cotton pad with a pair of tweezers and slowly lower it into a pot of melted candle wax.


Work carefully to avoid accidentally burning yourself on the wax.
Coat the majority of the cotton, leaving only a small patch uncovered.
Place the coated cotton on a sheet of wax paper and let the wax on the cotton cool and harden.

, Place the coated cotton in a plastic bag or plastic container. Keep them there until you are ready to use them.


Make sure that no moisture can get inside the container as you store it.

"
Place the teabags in a pan.,
Pour melted wax over them.,
Let the leaves absorb the wax.,
Store until needed.",How to Make Firelighters5," Spread the bags out evenly in the bottom of a shallow baking tray or similar container.This is a great way to recycle teabags already used to brew tea.
If you use loose tea leaves instead of teabags, place the leaves into the bottom of a paper cup, ice cube tray compartment, or similar mold.

, Carefully pour a small amount of melted candle wax over each tea bag, using just enough wax to cover the bag or the leaves.


You could pour liquid paraffin over the teabags instead of using melted candle wax, if desired. Either option should work just as well.

, Allow the coated teabags to sit out, undisturbed, until the bags and leaves absorb the melted wax.


This means that the wax will also cool and harden. When ready, the teabags will feel stiff and cool to the touch.

, Place the teabag firelighters in resealable plastic bags or containers. Store them away from any excess moisture until ready to use.

Grasp the match firmly at its midpoint.,
Press the match head into the striker.,
Quickly drag the match head along the striker.,
If needed, try again.,
Hold the lit match away from the matchbook.,
Tear a single match from the booklet.,
Hold the match flat against the striker.,
Fold the paper flap over to cover the match.,
Squeeze and pull!,
Alternatively, try lighting the match without folding the book.",How to Light a Match1," Use your your pointer (index) finger and your thumb to hold the match about halfway down the wooden stick. You can gently wrap your other fingers around the base of the stick for support if needed.


If this is the first time you've ever tried to light a match, stick with wooden ""strike on box"" matches for now — these are generally the easiest to light for beginners. Once you get confident with these, you can move onto paper matches and ""strike anywhere"" matches.;
, Look for a rough red or brownish strip on the side of the box. This is called the ""striker."" Hold the box in the hand you're not using to hold the match and press the match head (the round, colored part at the end) into the striker without moving it to either side yet.

, Without letting up the pressure, quickly slide the match head from one end of the striker to the other. This motion should be quite quick and hard. It's almost as if you're trying to rub the match head material off in a single rough motion. If you do this right, the match head will immediately catch fire, so don't be alarmed when this happens!









The exact amount of pressure you'll need to light the match here will vary from match to match and striker to striker. There's a ""happy medium"" between pressing so hard that the match breaks and pressing so gently that the match doesn't light. Within a few tries, you should get the hang of it.

, Matches don't always light on the first try. Don't worry if you don't get a flame immediately: simply repeat the striking motion again until you get a result. You may want to use a little extra pressure if you're worried that you were too gentle the first time.









After a few unsuccessful attempts, the flammable material in the match head (usually a mixture of potassium chloride and red phosphorus) will rub off.If this happens, try striking with the other side of the match head.

, You will know as soon as you light your match successfully. It will smoke and burst into flame almost instantly. At this point, grip the match near its base to protect your fingers from the flame and use the match to do whatever you need to do. Set the matchbook aside somewhere safe so that you don't accidentally catch it on fire. Congratulations — you've just lit your first match!

, Paper matches almost always come in small cardboard fold-over ""book"" — slip the flat piece of cardboard up to reveal a handful of small paper matches joined to the booklet at their bases. To get a match ready to light, grab one of the matches, fold it so it points away from the others, and tear it out at its base.









Paper matches are a little harder to light than wooden matches, but with a little practice, they're easily mastered. Don't worry if you have to try the tricks in this section several times until you find a method that's right for you.

, There are a few different ways to light paper matches, but the easiest is a little different than the way you'd light a wooden match. Start by laying the match down over the the striker (which is usually a small colored strip on the back of the matchbook). The head of the match should be in about the middle of the striker and the base of the match should stick out a little past the edge of the booklet.

, Without moving the match, bend the ""cover"" of the matchbook backward and fold it over the match. You should only be able to see the base of the matchstick poking out of the side of the matchbook. Feel for the round match head underneath the cardboard. Grab the matchbook here, putting gentle pressure on the match head through the cardboard with your thumb.









Try to keep the match head well-covered by the cardboard cover. If the edge of the match head is exposed when you strike the match, you can burn your thumb.

, Grab the base of the match that is sticking out of the folded matchbook with your dominant hand. Use your other hand to hold the booklet, pressing down on the match head. In one quick motion, squeeze down on the match head as you pull the match out of the booklet to the side. If done correctly, the friction between the striker and the match head should ignite the match head as you yank it out.









As with wooden matches, the match can sometimes fail to light even if you do everything. Be ready to try repeating the steps above a few times. If you don't get any results, flip the match over to expose the other side of the match head to the striker.
Be careful — if you squeeze the matchbook too hard, you can tear off the match head when you try to light the match. This wastes the match, so try to avoid it if you're running low.

, You can also light a paper match without squeezing it between the matchbook cover and the striker. This is a little trickier for beginners because it's easier to burn your fingers this way, but it is slightly quicker. To try this method, use these steps:









Hold the match in your dominant hand right with your thumb and middle finger. Put your index finger behind the match head. Hold the matchbook in your non-dominant hand.
Press down with your index finger and drag the match across the striker strip in a single quick motion — roughly like how you'd light a wooden match.
As soon as you notice the match light, move your index finger away from the flame or transfer the match to your other hand. You have to do this quick to avoid burning yourself.

Find a suitable fire area.,
Find suitable tinder.,
Don't use paper matches (the ones that look like thin cardboard).,
Light the match firmly but carefully and cup your hand around it.

,
Light the tinder in more than one place.,
If it does not burst in to flame but smolders, blow gently but consistently until it does.

,
Put bigger and bigger sticks or leaves on until you have a raging fire with little or no smoke.",How to Light a Fire With One Match," If you do not have a man-made fire pit, clear an area of all flammable material 3 feet (0.9 m) in diameter. Then dig a hole 10–12 inches (25.4–30.5 cm) wide by 6 inches (15.2 cm) deep. This is your fire pit.;
, (Charred cloth, birch bark, dried leaves/grasses, or other airy and fine materials are great. If you can find nothing dry, use bits of your own clothing, the contents of your wallet or purse, or anything which you may have on you which will take fire.)


Other tinder materials:
Dry milkweed fluff (found in the fall)
Paper gum wrappers
Frayed wooden stick
Dried moss or lichen (found on the ground or on rocks)
Pine bark or pine needles (very flammable)
Pine cones
Cotton ball, may have Vaseline, chapstick (it's mostly wax), or alcohol on it to help it burn
Dried leaves or grasses
Waxed paper from food or candy bars
Birthday candles, especially joke candles that don't blow out

, They burn out very easily. Use wooden ones. But if all you have is paper, don't give up; use them but remember they burn out more easily.

,, (3 or 4 corners usually work).

,, But be careful to not smother the fire. Add sticks slowly making sure the flame does not get smaller.

Check its Weight.,
Touch them.,
Knock on the wood.,
Listen for a Dull Thud.,
Look for cracks in the grain.,
Check the Bark condition.,
Use a Moisture metre.,
Buy in the summer.,
Buy from reputable suppliers who have an interest in supplying quality materials, cheap wood which sits smouldering on the fire or does not light is not good value.

",How to Choose Firewood Logs," Seasoned wood should feel light in weight, particularly softwoods. Hardwoods generally weight heavier than softwood, however you should never buy wood by weight as wet wood weighs a lot heavier than dry wood.;
, It should be hard and dry to the touch.

, When you knock two pieces together there should be a hard crisp knock, well seasoned softwoods can sound hollow when knocked.

, A dull thud usually indicates wet unseasoned wood.

, Well seasoned wood shrinks, causing cracks across the tree rings, particularly in hardwoods like Oak. Cracks will not always be present in dry wood but are usually a good sign.

, The bark should be hard and crisp. Often it will have shrunk and split from the wood underneath. If the bark is pliable then the wood has not been seasoned.

, The best and easiest way to test if wood is seasoned is to use a wood type moisture metre, these can be obtained quite cheaply at builders yards or online, e.g on ebay.

, As winter proceeds there is less and less quality seasoned firewood available as suppliers run out of the seasoned wood they have stored. This is particularly a problem this year as the very cold December used up supplies quicker than usual.

For best results, use ""strike anywhere"" matches for these tricks.,
Try striking on a rock.,
Try striking on rough building materials.,
Sandpaper.,
Try cautiously striking on your zipper.,
Try striking on a window.,
For an extreme challenge, try striking on your teeth.",How to Light a Match2," You don't have to use the included striker to light most matches — as long as you build up enough friction to heat up the match head, you can strike many matches almost anywhere that's dry. However, this is usually easiest if you use strike anywhere matches. As their name suggests, these matches are designed to light well on various surfaces.


Strike anywhere matches are usually wood matches identified as such on the packaging. They are not especially expensive: a 250-match box may cost as little as $2.Strike anywhere matches only work on dry surfaces.


, This trick is a must for campers, hikers, and anyone else who might want to improve their wilderness survival skills. For best results, you'll want to find a flat dry rock with a slightly ""rough"" or abrasive surface. The texture should be similar to sidewalk concrete. As noted above, the rock also must be dry. If you can't find a dry rock, find a suitable wet rock, wipe it on your clothing, and carry it in your pocket for a few hours or set it somewhere dry.


Hold the match between your middle finger and thumb and use your index finger to press the head into the rock. This is the same technique you'd use to light a paper match without folding the cover over. The rougher the rock's surface is, the lighter you'll want to press to hit the friction ""sweet spot"" for lighting a flame.

, If you're still in civilization but stuck without access to a match striker, you can usually use the materials around you in a pinch. Simply strike the match the same way you would if you were using a normal striker or a stone, using less pressure for rougher materials. For this to work, however, the material you use must be completely dry. Just a few possibilities for materials to use include:


Concrete
Grout (between tiles, etc.)
Brick
Ceramic
Keep in mind that striking matches can leave small marks on whatever material you're using, so you may not want to do it on other people's possessions.

, This trick is handy when you're caught without a matchbook in the garage or workshop. Very fine finishing sand papers work best for this — rougher Sandpaper can rub the match head off without lighting it. Simply lay a small patch of the sandpaper on a flat surface, then press the match head into it and drag it across just like you'd use a normal striker.


Never light matches around dry wood shavings (which are common in many places sandpaper can be found). This highly flammable material can easily start fires.

, This is great as a party trick, but it's something you'll want to attempt carefully to avoid hurting yourself or others. Open the front fold of your pants to expose the zipper. Use one hand to stretch the fabric of your pants so that the zipper is as straight and flat as possible. Hold the match in your other hand, press it into the top of your zipper, and strike downward with light pressure. This can be very tricky to get right, so don't be surprised if it takes many tries.



Always strike down towards the floor, not up towards your body. This way, if you lose control of the match, it will fall to the floor, rather than flying into your shirt.
Only attempt this if you are wearing pants made from a sturdy, thick material like denim that is unlikely to catch fire. Do not try this when you are wearing shorts or open-toed shoes.

, Believe it or not, even perfectly-smooth glass windows can light matches. You need to use a good amount of pressure for this method, so try putting your index finger right behind the match head so you can squeeze it into the surface of the glass with a little extra force. Press the match head into the glass, then draw it quickly downward in a single quick motion, keeping strong pressure behind it. Move your index finger away from the match head as soon as it lights to keep from burning yourself.


This can leave streaks on the window, so you may not want to do this on a window where people are likely to notice it. However, the streaks can usually be washed off without problems.

, This trick is sure to get the attention of people around you, but only attempt it if you're willing to protect yourself and others with plenty of common sense. First, get the fronts of your teeth as dry as possible with a clean rag or paper towel. Then, holding the tip of the match head against your teeth, whip it across them while applying firm pressure. Hold the match away from your mouth immediately, even if you don't think you've lit it successfully. Wash your mouth out with water when you're done.


Another variation on this trick involves holding the match behind your front two teeth and pulling it down and out.It should go without saying, but this trick requires lots of caution to pull off safely. It is very possible that you may burn your mouth and lips with this trick. Repeated attempts are not recommended, as the effects of the chemicals in match heads on the teeth are not well known.

Hold the match at a slight downwards angle to keep the flame burning.,
Hold the match at a very low angle to get a big flame.,
Hold the match straight up for a small flame that fades.,
Be aware of the wind.",How to Light a Match3," As a general rule, fire burns best when it can travel uphill.This is true even on a very small scale. Holding a lit match so that it points very slightly towards the floor will give it a gentle uphill path to travel as it consumes the matchstick.


This keeps the flame burning bright without having it travel towards your fingers too fast. You can always adjust the angle of the match upward to slow down the flame if you need more time.

, If you want to get a big flame on your match as quickly as possible, try dipping the matchstick downward for just a second or two. The flame should travel up the stick fairly quickly, giving you a larger flame. However, this flame will also be hotter and closer to your fingers, so be very careful with it.


Try to avoid pointing the matchstick directly downward. This will make the flame jump up the stick toward your fingers and is a great way to get burnt.

, Holding the matchstick upwards will make it hard for it to consume the fuel in the matchstick. The flame will shrink and burn more slowly. Over time, it will either travel gradually down toward your fingers or go out on its own.

, Be careful for breezes if you are lighting your match outdoors. These can blow your match out after it's lit, wasting your match. You may want to move to a place with no breeze or wait for the wind to die down before you attempt to light the match.









If you have to light a match in the wind, a good trick is to shield the flame by putting your body and hands between it and the wind."

Take apart a flashlight.,
Use one match.,
Insert the match into the disassembled flashlight.,
Hold the match steady.,
Remove the match quickly.",How to Light Wet Matches1," Unscrew the face-cap or tail-cap, depending on which type of flashlight you have. Remove any o-rings or lenses from the face-cap area. Remove the bulb and springs. Take the reflector - the bowled shaped piece - out of the upper part. The reflector is what you'll be using to light the match.


Most flashlights have a piece of glass or clear plastic inside the face-cap, which is just in front of the versatile concave reflective surface.
Keep track of the order in which the pieces fit together. You may even want to draw a quick diagram or make notes about how to put it back together.;
, Using more than one match will not be easy since the heat needs to be focused in one location, and the neck of the reflector is narrow. If you use multiple matches it may be difficult to put through the neck area, and will take longer to heat. Take out a single match from the box/pack of matches.


Ensure nothing is obstructing the pathway to insert a match into the flashlight. The springs, heads, and other pieces attached to the reflector should be removed as well. You should be holding the backside of the reflector without the rest of the flashlight.

, Stick the match through the hole in the reflective part you took from the flashlight. It's in the spot where the bulb would normally have been.


Make sure the head of the match is in the right way, with the head pointing outward towards the flashlight's end.

, Use your thumb and pointer-finger to hold the end of the match, the side with the wood. Hold it up directly facing the sun with it being held as far as possible away from you.


You'll need to angle it correctly to maximize exposure to the sun.
Hold it in this position long enough for it to be dried and to light.
Be patient. It could take several minutes for the drying process to work.

, Once the fire starts you'll need to remove the match. Be very careful doing this, so as to not burn yourself or brush it against the inside of the flashlight. You don't want to apply the heat to the inside of the reflector too long, especially if the face-cap has a piece of plastic inside. You also don't want the match to go out once it's on fire.


Be sure to have your kindling or fire-starting material close enough to quickly start your fire.
Put your flashlight back together after your fire has been started.

Consider that exercise can promote self-esteem.",How to Motivate an Autistic Teen or Adult to Exercise," During exercise, the surrounding environment should be calm and devoid of noise or distractions. There should be no disturbances and the environment should be pleasant.


Also, there should be no crowds nearby, because this can make autistic individuals confused and worried.
A natural environment with plants, greenery and fresh air works best.;
, Instead of giving verbal instructions, it is better to give visual guidelines like pictures, videos, or images. Some autistic people get confused by spoken directions. However, they can easily understand instructions if provided with pictorial aids.


For example, if you're going to play basketball with your loved one, show her TV programs or videos of people playing the game.

, Providing encouragement may be the most important aspect of your efforts. Get excited about exercise together. The best way you can encourage them is leading by example, getting involved in exercise and making it clear how much you enjoy it.


It may not seem fair to push your autistic family member to exercise, if you don't.
Demonstrate the activity, showing how fun it is, and then let them try.
Feeling encouraged yourself is a great start.

, Find out what kind of physical activity interests them. Many autistic people will be very open and enthusiastic about their specific interests, so maybe you can find a way to encourage them through their main interest.


Perhaps they enjoy watching sports on television, and you can get them involved in a safe, no-contact version in a sports program.
Certain exercise programs or sports may build on their interests, and lead to the development of other exercise and fitness goals.

, If you have fun with them and congratulate them on doing something good for their health, they'll feel positively about the experience, and want to do it again.


Similarly, if the exercise is done incorrectly, gently show them the correct way to perform the exercise.
If they didn't like it, tell them that it's okay, and you can try a different type of exercise the next time.

, Many caretakers have introduce their loved ones to the Special Olympics, which can be another way to encourage them. If they find a sport they love, they could even work towards a goal of competing in the Special Olympics.


Exposing autistic individuals to the Special Olympics shows them that there are successful athletes who are like them.
If they look up to a particular athlete, they may be more likely to give a specific sport a try.
Networking with other autistic/disabled people may also be encouraging to them.

, This exercise needs to be fun and exciting for it to really catch on.


Perhaps you can involve the whole family, taking a nice hike.
This could be incorporated into a science lesson, exploring nature while you hike as a family.

, Plenty of autistic people love music, so try dancing to some of their favorite songs to encourage exercise. There are are a variety of ways you can introduce dancing into the life of your loved one.


Wii Fit provides various games that can be played in the home. This provides a comfortable, familiar environment where sensory stimuli can be safely limited.
'Just Dance' is a popular dance game, providing a fun exercise option.
Check out Dance Dance Revolution games for a popular interactive dance experience.

, If you can make exercise seem like something that is a blast to do, your autistic friend will be far less reluctant to participate. There are many ways to make exercise fun.


Turn exercise into a game, once again making sure it's something they're passionate about.
Perhaps put an exercise video on and get involved. It may have fun music involved, making it seem less forceful.
For anxious or sensitive autistic people, stick with collaborative activities, because competition may make them nervous.

, Martial arts requires individuals to follow clear rules, be consistent, and display discipline. This ties into the natural strengths that accompany autism, and the mastery may build their self-esteem.


They also tend to do quite well based on the environment and rules.

, For example, after taking a half-hour walk with the autistic person, turn on the TV until suppertime. This will give them something to look forward to once it's done.

, This is a step-learning method in which you teach a physical activity by fully assisting the movement at first, and gradually reducing your assistance until independence is achieved.


For example, to help someone learn to catch a ball, hold their hands in your hands and help him catch the ball/racket. Then, hold the wrist, then the arm, then just the shoulder. Fading will occur when you don't hold anything anymore.

, Autistic individuals display remarkable focus in their passions, and frequently less focus on things that don't interest them. If an activity falls outside of their interests, it may be hard to get them involved. It's important to understand their hesitation before you try to motivate them.


Don't push too hard, or you can seem overbearing and turn off the person.
This is why it helps to incorporate their interest.
If they're disinterested, try unofficially designating exercise time as time for them to tell you about their interests. This gives you the opportunity to connect with them, and makes them more interested.

, It is not uncommon for autistic people to struggle with certain motor skills. For instance, problems with motor development can prevent an individual from throwing a ball or balancing on a bike.


Your loved one may be self-conscious about their ability to participate in certain exercise activities.
Not being able to successfully participate in activities can be very discouraging, so make sure you give your autistic loved one plenty of different options for exercise.

, Autistic individuals can be highly sensitive to certain stimuli. These sensory sensitivities may hinder their ability to take part in certain activities, even making them unbearable.


The bright light of a gym or sports field may be distracting or painful.
Consider sensory sensitivities that may not be readily apparent when motivating your loved one to exercise.
If you notice them getting uncomfortable, stop and ask what's wrong.

, Autistic individuals may struggle in terms of forming an exercise program. Unless assisted, it may be difficult for them to plan and monitor their exercise regime. Help them out by sitting down together and working it out, or by incorporating it into their daily routine.


Recording different milestones and accomplishments within the workout program can be a great way to increase motivation and continue building confidence regarding exercise.

, Many exercise activities involve teams, meaning that some level of social interaction is generally included. Because many autistic individuals struggle with social interaction, this may result in fear of team sports.


Try pursuing more individual forms of exercise, such as running, cycling, yoga, or swimming.
If they're close with a few particular people, e.g. their parents and siblings, then they may want to stick to backyard sports.

, Stomach issues are common with autistic people, who may have problems recognizing when they're hungry. This can lead to overeating or undereating, and can put their health at risk.

, Sports and exercise provide autistic individuals with an opportunity to work on social skills. There are numerous sports that are based on teamwork, but focus on independent achievements as well. These types of sports and teams will open up social opportunities, while focusing on personal achievement.


There will be social interaction, without so much emphasis on verbal communication.
This is seen in track, swimming, etc.
A basketball team may be too much to begin with, because the autistic individual may not be prepared for that social of an environment.
Social environments can be stressful for autistic people, so don't push them to do it if they don't feel ready!

, While there is nothing wrong with stimming, excessive stimming could present a problem (e.g. difficulty focusing in class, or bouncing so much during mealtimes that there is a choking hazard). This will help autistic people feel balanced without stimming constantly.


For example, swimming incorporates repetitive behaviors which may decrease repetitive behaviors outside of the pool environment.
Never try to stop someone from stimming; this is damaging.

, If an autistic individual is on medication, they may experience a number of side-effects. For instance, antipsychotics are commonly used to treat self-injury, and there can be significant side effects.

, Self-esteem is crucial to each person's sense of well-being. Getting involved in exercise can improve the way an autistic person views him or herself. You may find an activity that the individual excels at.


This can have positive effects on their self-esteem.

Choose a place where you will air-dry the wood.,
Assess the prevailing wind direction when you are choosing your spot.,
Avoid moisture by providing drainage and vapor barriers.,
Create a raised platform.,
Process your wood soon after the tree is felled.,
Cut your pieces slightly larger than you want the finished product.,
Seal the ends.,
Cut enough stickers to lay every 2 feet across your stack of wood.,
Create your base layer.,
Finish the stack.,
Weigh down the top of the stack.,
Purchase a moisture meter.,
Plan to dry fresh wood for at least one year.,
Bring wood inside in humid regions.",How to Dry Wood," You will need a place in the open-air that is large enough to house stacks of lumber. Don’t fall into the temptation of stacking your lumber in the sunniest spot on your land. Drying the wood too quickly will be detrimental to the quality and strength of the finished product. You want an open, yet shaded area.You can build a cover to create shade if you do not have a shady area.;
, Ideally, you want the wind blowing through the sides of the wood rather than the ends. Find a place where the wind usually blows in a direction which would cut through the side of your stack., You want a level surface to be able to stack your wood and have it safely balance, but choosing an area with a slight slope will allow for drainage in bad weather. If the ground is damp in this area, lay a vapor barrier, like a tarp, on the ground., You don’t want your wood to sit directly on the earth. Make a buffer between the ground and the wood stack using railroad ties, a concrete pad or a sturdy raised palette. Be sure the base is level.

, Once the tree has been cut or blown down, you want to cut the wood into your desired pieces as soon as possible. This will help you avoid damage from the elements.Leaving the wood where it fell makes it susceptible to rot, stains, mold and fungus.

, As wood loses moisture, it shrinks. Your green wood, or newly cut wood, should be large enough to allow for some shrinkage. This is especially important to keep in mind if you are drying planks of wood for carpentry.Wood shrinks an average of at least 5% in the drying process.It is likely the shape will also distort in the drying process. There is no need to plane the wood until it has reached EMC, equilibrium moisture content, meaning its moisture level is in balance with the surrounding atmosphere.

, Moisture is released 10-12 times faster from the ends of the wood. Seal the ends to moderate moisture loss and balance the rate of drying the entire piece of wood.Ends can be sealed using something as simple as latex paint, or an end grain sealer specially created for this purpose. Other options are paraffin wax, polyurethane and shellac.
Wood drying too quickly from the ends will result in cracks in the ends of the wood, known as end checks.You can cut the painted ends from your wood once it is done drying. In that case, leave some extra length on each end to compensate for the cut.

, Stickers are long, flat pieces of wood used to create space between each layer of wood in your stack. This allows air to flow between the layers. Stickers should be about 1 inch thick and 2 inches wide, and the length of the width of your stack.It is important to keep the width of the stickers uniform to keep your boards straight.
It does’t matter what type of wood you use for stickers, but walnut should be avoided since it can stain your lumber.

, Place a layer of lumber on your raised pad or palette. Leave an inch of space between each board. Place a sticker every 2 feet along the width of the first layer.

, Set a new layer of lumber atop the stickers running in the same direction as the first layer of lumber. Place stickers in exactly the same position as you did with the first layer. This will keep your stack balanced and your wood weighted evenly to avoid warping. Repeat until you have stacked all your wood., The wood on the bottom layers is weighted by the rest of the stack, but you will need to add weight to the top in order to keep the upper layers flat while they dry.


Place another layer of stickers on top of the final layer of wood.
Lay a large, flat surface like a piece of plywood on top of the stickers.
Set several cinder blocks on top of the plywood to apply weight to the stack.

, This is the best way to read exactly how much moisture is left in your wood. You can find moisture meters at woodworking supply stores. They run about $100 each.You can check the wood every few weeks to assess its progress.
Once the wood matches the moisture content of the air, it is ready to use.
Lumber sellers often kiln dry the wood at this point to bring the wood to an even lower moisture content. For small operations, this may not be necessary.
Aim for a moisture content between 6 and 12 percent MC, or moisture content.

, The standard guideline for drying wood used in woodworking is allowing one year for each inch of thickness. Measure your wood and decide how many years it will need to be set aside in your air-drying apparatus.


This is a good guideline for commonly used wood like walnut, cherry and oaks.
Poplar dries more quickly and can be ready in 6 months.

, Wood will only dry to EMC, meeting the level of moisture in the air surrounding it. People who live in damp or humid regions may need to bring the wood inside to finish drying it to a usable percentage between 6 and twelve percent MC, or moisture content.Move the wood into a contained and temperature and humidity controlled space like a shed, garage or heated basement.

Gather wood early.,
Choose a safe work area.,
Cut whole logs into uniform “rounds.” First, measure the dimensions of your fireplace, furnace, or any other area where you will burn wood.,
Split the wood.,
Choose an area ideal for stacking.,
Map out your row(s).,
Create a raised bed.,
Build bookends.,
Stack your wood in layers.,
Cover if desired.,
Inspect the color.,
Smell for sap.,
Test the bark.,
Judge by density.,
Build a fire.",How to Dry Firewood," Purchase or cut down your firewood no less than six months before you plan to burn it. For best results, do so even earlier to give it that much more time to air-dry. If possible, collect wood a year in advance in order to ensure thorough seasoning.Climate can affect drying times. Allow for more time if you live in a particularly wet region.
More time is also required for denser species of wood, like elm and oak.;
, Unless you purchased firewood that has already been split, pick an open area outside to cut and split the wood yourself. Make sure the area is open enough for you to handle a saw and/or ax without interference from any obstructions. Favor level ground over uneven ground to ensure good footing as you work.Keep people and pets well away from the work area. Once you begin cutting and splitting, check behind you frequently to make sure no one is approaching.

, Then subtract three inches (7.6 cm) from either its length or width, based on how the wood needs to be inserted into that space. Use this figure to measure and mark where to cut each whole log. Divide them into rounds of equal length with a saw or ax.Since wood shrinks as it dries, some people prefer to cut larger-than-needed rounds.As a beginner, err on the side of caution and cut smaller pieces until you grow familiar with how much shrinkage to expect.
If you live in a wet climate, cut even smaller rounds, since these will dry faster.Cutting uniform lengths of wood will make stacking them easier.

, Place your chopping block on level ground. Set a round on top with a cut side facing up. Saw or chop the round into halves from the top down.Repeat as needed with each subsequent half to create splits of wood that will fit into your fireplace, furnace, or other wood-burner.Split the wood at least once even if your wood burner will fit a whole round. Since the wood’s bark seals in moisture, it is critical to expose as much of the inner wood as possible.
For a quicker drying time, split the wood into smaller pieces than needed.
Additionally, split the wood into a variety of sizes. Create small pieces for kindling as well as larger pieces that will burn longer.

, Pick an outdoor space that receives little to no shade in order to maximize solar drying. Utilize the air by selecting an area that is open to prevailing winds or other air currents.Avoid areas prone to flooding, runoff, and/or standing water.


Refer to almanacs or weather stations to determine the direction of your region’s prevailing winds.
If your land is especially hilly, expect air currents to move up and down the face of hills.

, If possible, plan to stack your wood in a single row, with the cut ends receiving the strongest air currents head-on.Favor this method over multiple rows. Enable all of your wood to receive equal air circulation.


If space does not permit one long row of wood, space your row as far apart from each other as possible to allow the most airflow between them.

, Keep your firewood off bare ground. Avoid rot from moisture that collects below. Use material that won’t absorb water, such as concrete or a grid made of poles laid horizontally.In a pinch, use wooden materials like pallets or lumber that you have no other use for.Make the bed as level as possible for safer stacking.


If you use wood, line the top of the bed with tarps, plastic sheeting, or similar materials to block the transfer of moisture from the wood underneath to the wood on top. At the same time, create drainage holes in the materials so water doesn't pool on top.

, First, begin your row by placing the bottom layer of split wood along the length of the raised bed. Arrange each piece so that all of the cut ends face the same direction. Then, at either end of your row, create a second layer with the cut ends facing the opposite direction. Continue building up both ends of your row by alternating the direction that each layer faces in order to create stable bookends.You can either build the ends all at once or build them as you go. If you build them all at once, stop once they are approximately four feet (1.2 m) high.This way, the top of the pile will still be below head-level for most adults in the event of collapse.
Use your “best” pieces for the bookends. With each piece of wood, check all sides for evenness. Discard any that noticeably tapers from one end to the other. Such pieces may result in a less stable structure.
Keep the bark of each piece facing up. Since bark resists moisture, this will help shelter the exposed wood from rainfall., Begin your second layer in between the bookends. Arrange the cut ends so they face the same direction as the bottom layer’s. Set each piece so that it covers two pieces in the bottom layer by straddling where the two bottom pieces meet.Repeat until the pile reaches four feet (1.2 m) high.Place each piece with the bark facing up to shelter the exposed wood from rain.
Use smaller pieces to fill gaps, when needed, for stability.
Leave gaps as they are for better airflow if the layer is strong enough to support the next.

, Decide whether you are fine with leaving the pile as is or if you want to protect if from rainfall. If you decide to cover it, use black or clear plastic sheeting.For best results, support the sheeting with materials other than the pile itself (such as stakes or poles) so they don’t come into contact.Direct contact between the sheeting and wood allows the wood to absorb condensation from the plastic. It also reduces airflow and could result in tears in the plastic due to friction.
Black materials absorb heat and accelerate evaporation. Clear materials allow direct sunlight.
Unless you have a lot of rainfall and/or a very short drying season, leaving your pile uncovered should still result in dry firewood by the time you need it., Although the exact shade of wood’s color varies from species to species, expect your wood to grow darker as it dries. When you first split the wood, note how bright it is on the inside. Wait for the relatively white wood to fade into a yellow or grayish color before burning., When you first split your wood, hold a piece up to your nose and breathe in deep. Familiarize yourself with the smell of its sap. Then, when you’re ready to burn wood, select a test piece from your pile. Split it open and take a whiff. If you still detect sap, place it back in the pile for further drying., If most or all of the bark has fallen off on its own, consider the wood safe for burning. If not, slice the bark off with a knife. Inspect the wood immediately underneath. Allow any pieces that appear greenish more time to dry before using., When you first split the wood, note how heavy each piece feels. Expect the same piece to weigh considerably less once it loses its water weight. To double-check that it is has dried, knock two pieces together. If they sound hollow, consider them dried., If you are still unsure, assemble a few pieces for a test fire. If either the kindling or the larger pieces refuse to catch fire, give them more time to dry, since they are obviously still too wet. If they do catch, listen for hissing, which indicates the presence of water."

Get yourself ready.,
Find and position your chopping block.,
Position your wood.,
Face the wood and your chopping block.,
Grip your axe correctly.,
Observe the grain of the wood.,
Prepare your swing.,
Swing the axe.",How to Chop Wood1," Not only will you need some ready-to-split logs of appropriate length, which is approximately the length of your forearm, and your trusty axe, but you should also ensure your safety by equipping yourself with:


Work gloves
Work boots
Safety glasses (optional, but recommended);
, If you don't have a chopping block already, your most likely choice will be a large, thick piece of un-split wood. A flared stump also makes an excellent chopping block.


If you choose a thick piece of wood, look for one that is knotty, as these will be more resistant to the force of your axe and last longest as a chopping block.
Elm wood has a grain to it that makes it naturally split resistant. If an elm wood chopping block is available to you, you should take advantage of it.A recycled tire around the top of your chopping block can stabilize pieces of wood that don't balance well on your chopping block.A chopping block should always have yield; chopping on a hard surface can do damage to your axe or, in the case of a dangerous deflection, yourself.

, Take the piece of wood you want to split and balance it on your chopping block. You may have to adjust your wood to get it to stand correctly due to natural irregularities, like splits or knots, in the wood growth. Your log should be as stable as possible, with the area you are striking pointing toward the position where you will be chopping wood.

, Make sure there are no twigs, loose stones, slick mud, or anything else underfoot that might cause you to slip. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart and address your wood and chopping block head on.It is important that you keep your legs spread shoulder width apart. Poorly balanced wood or irregular grain/knots in the wood can cause your axe to hit a glancing blow. Keeping your legs shoulder width apart keeps you safest from landing your axe on your foot or toes.

, Take your axe in both hands with your dominant hand near the head of the axe and your non-dominant hand toward the end of the handle. A proper swing is executed by allowing your dominant hand to slide down the axe handle toward your other hand, which should remain stationary. This will give you greater control and delivers a more powerful blow., Note any knots or limbs. These will make your wood much harder to split. To split a knotted piece of wood, your best approach is going to be the most smooth grained part of the wood between knots/limbs.Checks, or small cracks already in your wood, are ideal places for you to land an axe blow.
The easiest wood to split will be smooth grained, with the lines of the wood looking consistent and regular

, Focus on your target. Bring your axe up on your dominant side, arcing it up over your shoulder in a smooth and steady motion.Grip the axe firmly in preparation for the swing, and make sure your stance is stable and your legs shoulder width apart.


Another acceptable technique is to bring your axe straight overhead and down on your piece of wood.

, Bring the axe quickly and firmly down, allowing your dominant hand to slide down the axe handle toward your other hand. Keep your focus stead on the spat at which you are aiming until your axe has struck.Depending on the thickness and knottiness of your wood, you may have to repeat your strike one or more times before the wood is split.

Use a magnifying glass.,
Take off your glasses.,
Use a clear plastic bag.",How to Light Wet Matches2," Hold the magnifying glass as still as possible, ensuring the focus of the sun is pointed directly at the match-head, and you’ll be able to take advantage of a process called solar thermal conversion.Try to ensure the dot of the magnification is as small as possible, to minimize the amount of time needed to dry out the match.
The smaller the dot of light, the more intense the heat is, and the quicker this will work.
Do not move the dot of light around. Keep it in the exact same location.

, Your glasses can concentrate the sun’s rays perfectly. Hold your glasses very still and create a small focal point focused on the head of the match. After a bit of time the match head will dry and ignite.


Because of the angle of glasses, there may be a need to rotate the glasses a bit to get the right angle.
Be sure to use just a single lens. Do not try to use both lenses to focus the sun's heat.

, Fill a clear, smooth plastic bag with water and form a sphere. With this balloon, you can focus the power of the sun onto a direct spot just like a magnifying glass.


Rotate the globe to find the right spot that maximizes the heat.If there are wrinkles in the bag, it may not work as well.
Plastic bags that are not clear will not magnify the heat as intensely or as specifically in one area.

Rub them in your hair.,
Use HotHands Hand Warmers (HHHW).,
Dry them out with wood.,
Rub your hands together.,
Put the matches in the oven.",How to Light Wet Matches3," Outdoorsmen of many cultures have rubbed matches in their hair to dry them out. A few minutes of rubbing leaves wet matches dry and able to light.


Sometimes they even store the matches in their hair to keep them dry for emergency purposes., The HHHW radiates dry heat. The dry heat should sufficiently dry out the matches so you can light them.Put the wet matches with HHHW inside your pocket and let it sit for 45 minutes.
The process could take longer if your have larger pockets or if the matches are especially wet.

, The matchbook may not be long enough to spark a damp match. Rub the match along the length of the wood, utilizing the full amount of possible friction. Repeat this process until the match lights., This method may take a while, but rubbing your hands together creates friction, and friction produces heat. By putting one match in your hands and rubbing together for long enough, you should be dry out the match enough to strike. , With the oven or toaster oven you can dry out the match after a certain amount of time and heat. Some studies have shown that wood exposed to a minimum 170ºF (76ºC) for a specific amount of time.


The greater the heat the better, and temperatures nearer 500ºF (260ºC) are better for quick ignition."
"
Evaluate your need.,
Collect your supplemental wood-splitting tools.,
Identify a central crack or promising cut.,
Insert your wedge.,
Prepare your hammer swing.,
Swing your sledgehammer.,
Separate the wood, if necessary.",How to Chop Wood2," If you are splitting normal sized wood, unless it is unnaturally knotty or a kind of wood resistant to chopping (like elm), you likely won't need to use a wedge. If the wood is tough and several axe swings leave cuts, cracks, but no clean split, it's time for you to get some more tools.

, When an axe alone simple can't do the job, it's time for you to get a long metal wedge and a sledgehammer. You can purchase these from your local hardware store or perhaps even borrow these from a neighbor.

, Even if your axe didn't pass all the way through your piece of wood, chopping it cleanly, if you landed a few hits, there will probably be at least some deep cuts in the wood, or maybe even a crack. Look for the deepest cut or crack in your wood; this is where you will split the wood.


Some especially large or difficult pieces of wood may require more than one wedge.

, As the wood will be softer than your wedge, you probably won't have a problem jamming the wedge into the cut or crack that you've chosen for your split. If you're attempting to cut an especially hard kind of wood, you may need to tap your wedge into place with your sledgehammer., Using the same form as you did with your axe, keep your legs shoulder width apart, your dominant hand close to the head of the sledgehammer, your eye focused on the wedge, and bring the hammer into position above your shoulder., Allow your dominant hand to slide down the handle of your hammer toward your stationary non-dominant hand, and bring the hammer quickly and firmly down on the wedge.This should drive the wedge more deeply into the piece of wood, causing the cut to turn into a crack or the crack that was already there to deepen.
You may need to swing your hammer multiple times to drive the wedge deeper into the wood.

, Sometimes, the wedge will cause the knot to break apart in a clean split, other times you may have to apply some muscle to pull the mostly split piece apart. In some cases, you may need to use your axe to carefully sever any connecting pieces that remain.

Read the manual.,
Check safety procedures.,
Fuel or power the machine.,
Gather your wood.,
Power on your splitter.,
Feed wood into the firewood processor.",How to Chop Wood3," Each firewood cutting machine will be a little different, and knowing its features and proper operation procedure will ensure safe use. Always operate these machines with care, as a mistake can result in serious injury., Before starting the machine, you should make sure its track is clear of objects, that cover panels are in place, and that you are wearing the right safety equipment to be operating the machine.These machines often require:


Non-loose clothing
Safety glasses
Work Gloves

, Some firewood splitters will be powered as attachments to a tractor, others might be powered by electric or gas power sources. Do not leave fuel or a power line anywhere that you might trip over it, or anywhere it might become tangled in the components of the machine., Once you have read the manual, you'll know the loading procedure of the machine. This will give you a better idea of where to best position the wood for loading it into the hydraulic splitter. Accumulate your wood where most convenient for your machine.

, Start the machine and observe its normal running procedure, without adding any wood. Make sure it appears to be running smoothly and check operations against the manual., Follow the instructions in your manual for loading uncut and removing cut firewood from your machine. No matter what kind of machine you are using, once it is powered on, always exercise caution around the splitter of the machine."

",How to Split Gnarly Firewood," For normal wood splitting, an axe might be all you need, but for gnarly wood, if you don't have access to a hydraulic log splitter, you will need the following:


Axe
Maul (aka: splitting maul, busting maul, etc)
Sledgehammer
Steel wedge (preferably more than one).;
, Because the crooked, irregular grain, (and likely knots) will make the splitting job more difficult, start out with the shortest cut you can use.

, This will save a lot of bending over, and make the use of the Sledgehammer and maul much easier.

, These indicate weak grains, which may be easier to begin a split in.

, Even if the wood looks gnarly, it may not be as bad as it appears. If you see a large check crack on one end, this is what you will want to aim for.

,,,, Set the wedge in any crack that you can see, then tap it into the wood like you would begin driving a nail.

, Use a good, solid blow, taking care to place it accurately. The wedge should begin to split the block by forcing the grain to separate where the wedge penetrates the wood.

, If your wedge is thick and wide enough, eventually, the wood will split. If you end up burying the wedge completely and the wood still hasn't split, you may have to drive a second wedge in further along the crack.

, You may find you have to chop apart some splintered wood grain around large knots to completely split the block.

, As the blocks become narrower, they should split much more easily.

Use a maul or splitting wedges to split hardwood.,
Cut your wood to length.,
Set up a chopping block.,
Set up in a safe location.,
Always wear the appropriate protective gear.",How to Split Hardwood Firewood1," A splitting maul is essentially a thicker, more wedge-shaped axe made for splitting hardwood along the grain, with a blunt sledge-hammer edge on the back of the splitting blade. These are typically somewhat heavier than an axe, usually by several pounds, and the weight of the maul makes the job easier.


Splitting wedges are basically metal wedges that you drive into the wood with a sledge. The benefit of the wedge is that you can place it along the grain to split the wood, then drive it into the exact same place until it splits.
Axes are used to chop wood, not to split it. It's best to use a maul or splitting wedges if you want to split hardwood.

, Normal wood stoves and smaller fireplaces usually take a 16 to 20 inch (40 to 50 cm) log, and the shorter the log is, the more easily it will split. You should cut your wood to the most efficient length for your purpose, in terms of both handling and storing it, as well as making it a suitable length for your application.


Try to cut the ends of each piece of firewood square and flat, as you will need to stand them on end to split them, and crooked cuts will make this difficult to do.

, Usually a large section of the tree's trunk, this will be the surface you place individual logs on to split them, making it easier to swing your axe, and causing less strain on your back. A wood surface about 6 inches off the ground is appropriate for any splitting job.


The block should be neither too high nor too short, to avoid dangerous ricochets if you should strike a glancing blow.
Always split on some kind of block, never the ground and never concrete. The ground will do in a pinch, but you'll tire more easily if you have to lift the heavy maul that much higher. Save your strength and split on a block, especially if you've got a lot of wood to split.

, Allow for good footing and make sure there is no debris or overhanging limbs around where you will be working.


Splitting hardwood is especially efficient on cold days, if the wood has been properly aged before splitting. Pieces of hardwood will pop right apart with the proper technique during cold weather, making your job much easier.

, For a day of splitting hardwood, outfit yourself properly. You should wear good-quality gloves to save your hands from splinters that will make the work much more uncomfortable, safety glasses, and solid work boots, preferably with a steel-toe. Never split wood by yourself, make sure someone else is at least around who'll be able to aid if you should have an accident."

Gather/maintain a supply of empty toilet paper or paper towel rolls/tubes.,
Maintain a supply of electric clothes dryer lint.,
Gather a fistful of dryer lint.,
Push lint into the roll.,
Get your fire ready.,
Place your fire starter next to a log in the middle of your kindling pile.,
Finished.

",How to Make Fire Starters with Paper Rolls and Dryer Lint," Make sure they are still in decent condition and are not torn or haven’t been damaged in any way and make sure it is extremely dry for maximum flammability. If it is damaged you can use some superglue since it is a flammable material (the fire may smell different).;
, Whenever you clean out the lint trap, keep a small bucket or container near the dryer. Instead of tossing into the garbage, throw the lint into your container and keep in a safe, dry spot for future use.

, Size up the empty roll/tube you plan to use. Obviously the larger the roll, the more lint you will need. You want to stuff enough lint into the roll to fill it, but not overstuff it.

, Stand the roll on its end and push lint downward until it touches the other surface. Add more lint until fire starter is completely full.

, Whether you are creating an outdoor bonfire or something cozy in the fireplace, make sure you have ample wood and matches/lighter for the job. To make sure that your fire has a larger chance of actually working you will need to make a pyramid shape with the wood.

, That way the fire can move evenly throughout the log/wood area.

"
Place your first log on the chopping block.,
Examine the wood before splitting it.,
Aim.,
Bring the maul up and down.,
Pull the axe bit out of the log if the wood fails to split on the first swing.,
Repeat your swing into the wood until the wood splits.,
Split and stack.",How to Split Hardwood Firewood2," Make sure it is stable, and near the center of the block, if possible.


Swinging a heavy maul at an unsteady block is extremely dangerous. A glancing blow could strike your leg, or send the wood flying off like a dangerous projectile. Set yourself up for success by placing the wood securely.;
, Look for hairline cracks in the log. You should aim so that the blade of you the maul runs in the same direction as the crack.


Different woods split in different ways, so plan accordingly. Oak splits somewhat easily through the center, even large-diameter portions. Maple, on the other hand, is split more easily toward the edges of the end-grain.
Look for large knots or places where a limb was removed when the wood was cut and avoid them. These places will likely have very crooked, gnarly grain, which should be avoided if possible. You could spend all day hacking away at knots.

, Choose the location you want to split the log, stand with your maul resting on that location, and set your feet square. You might tap a little indentation into the wood so you'll have a good visual cue at which to guide the maul, if the grain isn't obvious from where you're placed.

, You don't really ""swing"" a maul, and you don't need to put the end behind your head at any point to split wood properly. Hold the maul firmly with your non-writing hand at the end of the handle, and cradle the maul with your dominant hand, just below the head of the maul. Flex your knees slightly, then lift the maul head straight up above your head, extending your arms straight.


Slide your strong hand down until both of your hands are close, gripping the end of the handle, then bring your hands down and flick your wrists, letting gravity do much of the work for you.
Splitting has much less to do with strength and more to do with using the correct technique. Swinging the maul wildly is both dangerous and exhausting.

, You may have to pull and twist it hard to remove it, if the bit is sunk deeply and stuck in the wood. Rock the axe bit up and down to work it out of the wood.


Alternatively, you can treat the planted maul like a splitting wedge and hit the blunt metal end of the maul with a sledge. This is a popular and common technique for splitting logs. If you've placed the maul accurately, or it's quite stuck, don't waste energy pulling it out.

, Try to strike in exactly the same place as the first time, or along the length of any crack which appeared when you hit it.

, Split each block of wood into progressively smaller pieces, until they are the desired size. Normally, you will split the block in half, then each half will be split again, until the pieces are about 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) at the largest cross section.


Stack split wood so that air can circulate around it to allow it to season thoroughly before it is burned in a wood stove or fireplace. Cover it to prevent rain from repeatedly wetting it, which will cause it to rot, but do so in a manner which still allows good air circulation.

"
"
Have several wedges on hand.,
Tap the wedge into the grain with a sledge.,
Hammer with the sledge.,
Finish the job.",How to Split Hardwood Firewood3," Wedges work best for knotty pieces of wood or especially hard or large-diameter pieces of wood. Because it's possible to drive a wedge deep into a thick log without necessarily splitting it, it's good to have back-up wedges available to save your initial wedge and complete the job, if it should get in over it's ""head"".


If you're commonly splitting with wedges, a good combination would be a sharp starter wedge that you can use to really bite into the wood and get it started, and another blunter but wider wedge that you can use to continue splitting once you've gotten it started.

, A short-handled sledge should work just fine for the job, depending on the size of the log and what's available. Holding the wedge like you would a very-large nail, tap it in until it can stand on its own.

, Using solid and straight blows, hammer the wedge into the log along the grain until it splits. If you hammer it all the way in and the log still hasn't split, start your other wedge along the same crack, but closer to the edge of the wood so the force will make the split longer, freeing both wedges and splitting the log.


Be sure to stand clear of the line of the cracking, so the wedge won't pop out at your feet, dangerously. As you hammer, stand perpendicular to the splitting of the log and the wedge itself.

, There might be some remaining connected wood fiber that you can finish with an axe, and you can likely use a maul or an axe to split the sections into smaller, more manageable pieces. Don't use wedges to split smaller sections of wood, as the likelihood of them popping through and flailing loose is more probable.

"
Before drying, know the properties of your wood.,
Gather and stack wood at the right time of year.,
Chop the wood in readiness for storage.,
Store the wood outdoors.,
Stack the wood so it isn't sitting directly on the ground or right up against a wall.,
Allow space between the stack and a wall to allow air to move.,
Ensure that the top of the wood is covered to allow rain (or snow) to run off without soaking the wood.,
Check for wood dryness.",How to Season Firewood," The duration of seasoning depends on the wood and for deciduous trees, when the tree was felled. The sap of deciduous trees moves to the roots in the winter, so such trees felled in winter have a much lower moisture content to begin with, and so will be seasoned more quickly. In general, pine and other softwoods require around 6 to 12 months to season, while hardwoods such as oak require a year to 2 years.However, this rule of thumb has exceptions, so knowing the tree type and its water content is important.


Surface water will usually evaporate quickly; the concern is the moisture content within the wood.
Wood such as shagbark hickory, cherry and black locust will gain little benefit from air drying, as they have low moisture content. On the other hand, wood from such trees as hemlock, cottonwood, American elm and sycamore will benefit from long drying times. Many other tree types are variable.Importantly, there isn't any point seasoning wood longer than it needs to be. Over-dried wood will have less energy as volatile esters in the wood evaporate. These waxy substances contain a great deal of heat energy, so it is a mistake to think that longer is necessarily better.
A special instrument can be hired or purchased that tests the moisture content of wood (usually known as a ""wood moisture test meter"" or similar).;
, With the exception of wanting to gather deciduous trees when their sap is lowest during winter, gathering and seasoning wood during the summer season makes good sense because you can take advantage of the warm weather to start drying out the wood. In areas with little rainfall during summer, open air storage is also a viable option; any rain that does fall will usually replace sap and as the water evaporates faster in the heat, the fuel will dry faster., It's best to get the pieces down to no more than 6-8 inches (15cm-20cm) in diameter. Eighteen inches (45cm) long is a common size, though 16 inches (40cm) is the correct length for a face cord and will fit better in smaller stoves.

, Do not store wood inside; if there are termites, you don't want them getting at your house!

, If you don't have a woodshed, cut two saplings to use as a base to keep the firewood from contact with the ground. Pallets are also a great alternative.


If you don't have or don't want to make side supports, you can stack the ends by turning the direction of wood 90 degrees with each layer and the end stacks will be self supporting.

, Air circulation is an essential part of the seasoning process, to ensure that the wood dries. Ideally, you would have a moisture barrier such as a tarp below the wood, and/or have it spaced up off the ground to allow air flow.

, However, keep the ends of the stack uncovered to allow air to circulate and moisture to escape.


Bark acts like a lid on firewood, offering natural protection.On split wood, stack the wood with the bark on the bottom to allow the wood to dry faster. If you are storing the wood without cover, stacking with the bark on top will prevent some of the rain from soaking into the wood.
There are two theories on the covering of wood during the seasoning process and you must decide for yourself which theory you wish to follow. One theory is that already stated––cover the wood to prevent the rain and snow from entering the center of the stack and gathering there. However, within the firewood community, another theory holds that you do not have to cover your wood at all, ever. Just leave it out there in the weather and it will season just as well as if you covered it. This theory has its supporters and the they are quite sure it works just as well as covering your pile. Perhaps divide your wood and try an experiment with both ways.

, You can use the wood moisture test meter as mentioned earlier, if you have access to one. Alternatively, try these simple test:1. Pick two pieces of wood that you think is dry. Knock the two pieces together. If you hear more of a ""ring"" than a ""thud"", then it's probably dry.
2. Also, check for radial cracks at the ends of the wood, which indicate dryness.
3. Burn a piece on a roaring fire base. If three of the sides begin to burn within 15 minutes, the fuel is dry.

Design your sawbuck/sawhorse by considering various methods shown in the illustrations.,
Use suitable boards for your project.,
Consider starting with one (the first) ""X"" temporarily attached together with two nails/screws to see how tall and wide that you want to make it.,
Use this as your pattern for the rest.,
Design a lower sawbuck if you would like to use the ""X"" sawbuck with a hand ""bow-saw"".,
Design a wide, heavily braced base to give you more stability while handling a chainsaw.,
To build a non-folding sawbuck, simply connect the ""X"" forms together, using 4 to 6 nails/screws driven permanently into the near-center of each ""X"".








",How to Build a Sawbuck for Cutting Firewood1," Design the permanent sawbuck to be 6 vertical 2x4's (38 mm x 89 mm) or 2x6s (38 mm x 140mm) of about 4 feet (1.22 meters) long and 4 horizontal 2x6's 5 feet (1.52 meters) long using 3.5 inch (8.89 cm) wood screws or nails. (See ""Tips"" for information on making a demo/prototype version instead.)









Cutting the top ""V"" form portion at an angle and with a shorter top would make it lighter and more open. Adding a trough or floor, as a retainer like feature, into the top ""V"" allows for a lower chance of shorter pieces of firewood unexpectedly falling from the inner part of the sawbuck to the ground.

,, Tailor the design as you desire or require.








, Nominal 2X6s or 2X4s of pine (southern yellow or lodgepole or white), or spruce will be fine.

Adjust the height according to what feels right to you.

,









Take it apart and angle-cut and trim the angle of the ""V"" as shown in the photo above. Angled cutting of the ""V"" and making the upper ""arms"" shorter than the ""legs"" will make it less top-heavy. The arms help to hold poles and limbs to be cut on the sawbuck.

,









Feature: the upper ""V"" part being deep allows you to nestle and cut two or more narrow poles or tree limbs (around 3 to 8 feet (91.44 cm x 44 meters) in length) for cutting with a chainsaw to chop your firewood at a faster rate.

, Make the sawbuck about only 20-24"" (50.8 cm x 60.9 cm) high to the center. This will allow the user to put a foot on top of the poles or resulting in the split wood being cut when it is that low (as illustrated).

, Mix the cotton fibers with Vaseline (or any petroleum jelly). Push as much of this mixture as possible into the straw. For quick mincing, use scissors to get the process started.


Place a small amount of the cotton-Vaseline mixture at the top of the straw (the un-fused end) and then use your stick to push it down inside the straw. Make sure it reaches the end of the straw.







, Just be sure to leave enough room at the top of the straw so that you can fuse it together.

Plan an aerobic maintenance schedule within 25 to 30 days of the end of intense physical training.,
Measure your current aerobic endurance to find the level you want to maintain.,
Reduce your current aerobic training sessions but keep the same workout intensity.,
Aim to workout at least 45 minutes at 60 to 70 percent of your maximum heart rate.,
Wear a heart rate monitor while you exercise to measure your aerobic levels.,
Rotate your intense workouts with interval, such as fartlek, training.,
Test your aerobic endurance with your personal trainer every 2 to 3 months, to make sure you are maintaining your endurance.",How to Maintain Aerobic Endurance," Studies have shown that aerobic endurance can remain for as much as 30 days; however, at that point it will be difficult to maintain without another intense training course.;
, Most personal trainers in gyms have access to fairly adept computer systems that can give an accurate estimate of your body's oxygen use. The trainer will ask you to jog on a treadmill or use a stationary bike or treadmill to see how much moderate aerobic exercise you can do before reaching an anaerobic level.


You can also opt to find a health care professional who can conduct a VO2 test. This directly measures the volume of oxygen that you use while engaging in aerobic exercise. This can only be conducted using specialized equipment, often in a clinical research facility, under the supervision of a doctor or nurse. You may be able to find a training center that can conduct this test, but it is likely to be more expensive than an estimate done by a personal trainer.

, Studies have shown that if you cut your number of weekly aerobic workouts by 50 to 70 percent, you can maintain aerobic endurance. However, you must be sure to keep the same level of intensity during your maintenance workouts.


For example, if you used to jog for 60 minutes 5 times per week, you can cut your 60-minute workouts to 2 times per week and still maintain aerobic endurance.
If you cut the intensity of your workouts, but do them more often, you will not maintain your endurance. For example, if you jogged for 30 minutes 5 times per week, you will reduce your aerobic endurance.

, Maximum heart rate is estimated as 220 minus your age. For example, if you were 43, then your maximum heart rate would be 177 and you would want to stay between 106 to 124.

, These can be purchased on the Internet or in sports stores. Measure your heart rate while you work out, in order to make sure you are staying at the proper heart rate.

, ""Fartlek"" is Swedish for ""speedy-play,"" and it was developed by a coach to train a cross-country racer. In this training, you can tailor the training to your sport or preferences, while basing your training on the following guidelines:


Warm up before starting the intervals. Jog at an easy pace for 5 to 10 minutes.
Choose a city block or long path with landmarks to serve as your ""track."" Start slowly for half a block. Increase your pace for the other block and then race for 1 block.
Walk for 1 or 2 minutes. Repeat the previous segment 2 to 6 times.
You can also use a stationary machine and increase your intensity according to the same benchmarks as the example fartlek running training. You can choose the intensity of your workout, but most fartlek workouts last for 45 minutes.

, If your endurance has decreased, you may need to return to endurance training to return to your original level.

Correct your body alignment.,
Practice.",How to Kick Higher," Wear athletic shoes and flexible clothing. Start each exercise session with these stretches.


Even if you are not working out, try doing these stretches twice each day to improve your flexibility.Try to make them part of your morning and evening routine.;
, Reach your right arm straight out in front of you, parallel with the ground. Your hand should be flat with your palm facing the ground. Step forward to put your weight on your left foot and kick your right foot up towards your hand with your toes flexed. You should work towards touching your toes to your palm.


Repeat while alternating legs.
Go back and forth over the 10 yards (9.1 m) 4 times while repeating the exercise.

, Place a sturdy chair before you. Step back and lean forward onto the chair.


Start with your feet slightly turned out.
Place your right foot straight out behind you with the toe touching the ground.
Kick up as high as you can, while making sure your lower back stays stable. Look straight ahead to keep your spine in alignment.
Repeat, kicking up 20 to 30 times.
Switch legs. Aim to stretch your leg as far as you can backward while you kick.
Always kick with control., Extend your arms in front of you and hold your hands at waist height. Run in place while lifting your quads high enough to touch your hands with every step. Continue alternating your knees as many times as possible for 30 to 60 seconds.


High knee exercises are also good for the core and for cardio training. Repeat during high-intensity intervals.

, Run in place, but keep your thighs straight beneath your body and kick your lower legs back on each step. Bring the heel of your foot up as high as possible with each step. The goal is to kick your glutes with your heels. Run in place for 30 seconds. This exercise will target your glutes which are important in increasing the flexibility and extension of your hips., You should be doing basic hamstring, quadricep and hip flexor stretches before you take these on. Make sure you warm up with at least 5 minutes of cardio before doing them.

, Sit on the ground with your legs outstretched as wide as they can go. Place your hands firmly in front, just above your groin.


Transfer your weight slowly to your arms.
Rotate forward until you start to feel a stretch in your groin. Stop rotating when the stretch becomes too painful.
Hold the stretch for 90 seconds to 3 minutes.

, Get into a hurdle position, with the right leg outstretched and the left leg stretched in the opposite direction. Keep a knee bend in your left leg until you are set up for the stretch.Place your arms on either side of your legs.
Transfer the weight into your arms. Lift your body up and try to unbend your back knee from the hurdle position.
Aim to keep both legs outstretched in opposite directions, with the weight concentrated on your center.
Hold the stretch in a position that isn’t too painful. Stay in the position for 30 to 60 seconds. Switch sides.
Do this stretch every day for maximum benefit.

, Once you have mastered center splits and side splits, you are prepared to increase your groin and leg flexibility for even higher kicks. When you get in the full split position, place a rolled up towel below your front foot.

, Enroll in basic pilates classes, which are known for both core strengthening and flexibility. You can also rent pilates DVDs from your local library.

, Lay down with your back flat. Bring your knees up to tabletop position while you flex your core in and up.


Lift your shoulders, neck and head up from the ground.
Straighten both legs. Move your right leg to a 45-degree angle.
Reach and grasp the back of your left leg.
Kick the right leg toward you while you lower your left leg to 45 degrees. Grasp your right leg.
Kick up twice and switch your legs.
Repeat for 30 seconds to 1 minute.
Once you improve your core strength, try to do this exercise without your arms.
The scissor kicks will improve flexibility and ab strength.

, Get onto all fours with your wrists directly below your shoulders.Stretch one leg back until it is fully extended, then the other. This will transfer your body weight onto your toes and hands. Be sure your body is in a long line.


Hold the position for 30 seconds. Work up to 2 minutes with good form.
The plank exercise will strengthen your entire body. Do it on an exercise mat to increase stability. , Lay on your stomach. Reach your arms and legs straight out.


Lift your right arm and your left leg. Hold them for 3 seconds.
Lower those limbs and lift your left arm and right leg.
Repeat the swimming motion slowly for 1 minute.
Then, kick your arms and legs in a swimming motion quickly for 1 minute.
This exercise will improve your back strength.

, Increasing your balance will greatly improve your ability to maintain control while kicking. You can work on your balance daily with simple exercises such as standing on one foot for 30 seconds each, or walking heel-to-toe in a straight line.If you workout at a gym you can try balancing yourself on the wobble board as well.

, To perform various kicks as high as you can, be sure that you are using the proper techniques by studying your body alignment. If your body is not in the correct position to execute kicks you may not be able to kick very high, and you may increase your chance of injury.


When doing a side kick raise your right arm to the side with your palm down. Lean forward slightly so that your pelvis tilts. Raise your right leg, keeping it bent slightly and kick the palm of your hand with the side of your foot. Increase the height of your hand as it becomes easier to perform the kicks., It doesn't matter if you want to kick higher for dance, martial arts or cheerleading, you need to practice. Regular practice with build the muscles you use to kick while improving your balance and form. Learning to kick higher won't happen overnight, but if you stick with your training you will improve over time.

Hold the salt.,
Drink.,
Get lots of rest and sleep.",How to Lose Weight in 3 Days2," Sodium helps to store water in the body, and limiting your intake of salt and other foods high in sodium can help you get rid of extra girth-widening water weight.Limit your daily sodium intake to 1-1.5 grams (.04-.05 oz) a day. (Less than 2.3 grams, or .09 oz, is the medically recommended amount for those under 50).Avoid canned and prepackaged foods, including sauces and dressings. These types of preserved foods often rely on salt as a preservative and are thus packed full of sodium.
Drop deli meats and cold cuts. These are also packed with sodium.Skimp on the salt when cooking.
Cut down on cheese. Cheese is high in salt.

, It's important to stay hydrated.


Get lots of water. It might seem counter-intuitive, but drinking a lot of water is quite important when you're trying to lose water weight. Drinking about a gallon (3.8 liters) of water throughout the day will help to normalize your hydration levels and keep you fluids in balance.Add some lemon to your water. Lemon can act as a digestive aid and diuretic, which can help with both water retention and bloat.
Go for that second cup of coffee or tea. These drinks can act as diuretics, which means they stimulate your body to release more water.

, Besides sodium, the levels of cortisol in the body also affect water retention.Make sure your cortisol levels are in check by getting at least 7-9 hours of sleep a night.
Try scaling back on your exercise activities for 3 days. Exercise can actually elevate cortisol.Relax and de-stress with calming tea, soothing music, meditation, and breathing exercises. These can all help chill you out and bring down your cortisol levels.

Take an anti-gas pill.,
Try a magnesium supplement.,
Do some stomach-specific stretches.,
Make some dietary changes.",How to Lose Weight in 3 Days3," While it is not recommended to turn to water shedding or ""diet"" pills, you can safely try taking one over-the-counter anti-gas pill to reduce excess air, gas, or other forms of intestinal bloat for a quick slimming effect.

, If you don't have gastrointestinal issues, try taking a magnesium supplement to help clear out your gut., This will help to elongate and relax your stomach muscles.Try bending both of your knees into your stomach while lying on the floor. In some cases, this posture can temporarily improve your bowel function.
Focus on your posture, too. Try to sit and stand up straight and don't hunch over or collapse your stomach. This can cause your stomach to seize and cramp up.

, Changing what and when you eat can help you banish the bloat.Avoid beans, the notoriously gassy musical fruit.
Eat smaller meals, slowly, and more frequently throughout the day to avoid bloating up when you eat.
Go for protein smoothies, yogurt, and low sodium soups instead of solid food. Liquids are easier to digest and don't pouch out your stomach as much as solid meals. Throw some fiber-rich fruit into your smoothies and yogurt to help move things along in (and out of) your intestines.Avoid carbonated beverages and chewing gum. The bubbles in these drinks can bloat you up, and you ingest a lot of extra air when you chew gum."

Don’t skip breakfast.,
Veg out on veggies.,
Drink lots of water.,
Avoid liquid calories.,
Cut back on “problem foods.” The biggest “problem foods” are solid fats, added sugars, salts, and starches.,
Control your portions.,
Eat smaller meals more often.",How to Lose Weight in 3 Days4," This really is the most important meal of the day, even when you’re trying to lose weight. Focus on eating lean protein (eggs or low-fat Greek yogurt) for breakfast as a way to jump-start your metabolism, stay fuller longer, and help you burn calories throughout the day.

, Eating fiber-rich fresh vegetables as part of your meals and as snacks will help you curb hunger and eat less throughout the day.

, Skip sugary types of drinks and stick to pure, simple water.Drink 8 ounces (.25 liters) of water before every meal to help you feel full even before you start eating. Water also helps boost your metabolism and aid in digestion.
Be sure to drink at least 64 ounces (1.9 liters) of water every day.
Try infusing your water with non-sugary flavor sources, like fresh mint, basil, or cucumber slices to make hydration more palatable.

, High calorie drinks can be dangerous in that you end up consuming more calories that you notice. Try to limit drinks like sugary juices, sweetened coffee or tea, and alcoholic beverages., These count for more than 800 of our daily calories, and we often consume them without even noticing!Pay attention to food labels and avoid products with solid, trans, and saturated fats as well as added sugars.
Eliminate fast foods and refined grains (white bread, for example) which are loaded with fats and often pumped full of extra, unnecessary sugars.
Limiting salt and starches will help you reduce fluid retention and shed water weight, which is great for a quick slim-down fix., It's just as important to consider how much food you’re eating, in addition to what kinds of foods you’re eating.Try to cut back on your portions to save calories, and follow these basic guidelines for portion control:Eat 5-6.5 ounces (142-184 grams) of lean (not fatty) proteins like chicken, beans, and fish.
Eat 5-8 ounces (142-227 grams) of grains, with 1/2 from whole grains.
Eat 1.5-2 cups (.35-.5 liters) of fruits.
Eat 2.5-3.5 cups (.6-.8 liters) of vegetables.
Consume 3 cups (.7 liters) of nonfat or low-fat diary.
Eat no more than 5-7 teaspoons (25-35 ml) of oils (try to get these from plant and protein sources).
Eat no more than 121 calories from solid fats and added sugars.

, Instead of having just a few big meals in a day, spread out your food into several smaller sized meals. This will help keep your blood sugars and metabolism up, and reduce the temptation for snacking in between meals."

Focus on cardio.,
Work in weight-lifting.,
Go for max calorie burn.",How to Lose Weight in 3 Days5," Cardiovascular exercises, like running, swimming, or aerobics, burns more calories which is ideal for quick weight loss..


Always consult your doctor before you begin a new exercise (or diet) routine.
Be sure to break a sweat after you finish warming up, and keep the intensity up for an hour of cardio work.
Try including intervals, which are short bursts of high-intensity, in your workout.
Aim for 70 minutes of cardio exercise a day for 3 days to melt away fat., Engaging in light weightlifting and strength training will help you build muscle and burn fat.


Muscles eat up fat and calories, even when your’re at rest.Don’t go crazy when you first start to lift weights. You don’t want to injure yourself. Instead, start with some basic weight lifting techniques., If you burn 500 calories more than you eat every day for week, you can expect to lose around 1-2 pounds. If you’re eating between 1,000-1,200 calories a day and exercise for one hour per day, you can lose between 3-5 pounds."
"
Eat 5 meals a day is crucial, spaced out every 2.5 to 3 hours.,
Eat complete protein in all your meals.,
Drink at least 2L of water a day.,
Increase your calorie intake.,
Lift Heavy Weights and Do Compound exercises.,
Go slow on the negative rep.,
Get 8 hours of sleep.",How to Increase Muscle Growth," This keeps your metabolism working and to maintain a nitrogen positive balance for muscle growth.;
, Muscle growth occurs when your nitrogen consumption level is greater than nitrogen output. The greater the nitrogen balance, the faster your workout recovery will be. This is the body's anabolic state. The opposite is true when you're in a negative nitrogen balance.

, A major part of building muscle is helping your body to eliminate waste, so it can focus on growth (like building new muscles). Water helps to get rid of fat (a form of waste), so drink up. The best form of water to drink is alkaline water, also known as Kangen water. It is the best source of water for fast recovery after an intense work out.

, You have to eat more whole organic food to build muscle. The average male needs to consume 2200 calories a day, female is roughly 1300. The closer you are to these numbers, you're maintaining your body weight. To increase muscle growth, you will need to add a minimum of 1000 calories, so 3200 calories for males (it may be more calories, depending on your size and how big you want to get).

, Weightlifting is the best way to build fast muscle. You should strive to do compound exercises like pull ups, dead lifts, squats, walking lunges etc. These types of exercises encourage your body to build your primary muscle groups, (lats for pull ups), but it also help to build the secondary muscle groups (biceps) as well as your core. What ever exercise you're performing, you should strive to do 8-12 reps max, meaning that you should not be able to lift more than 12 reps on each exercise.

, Muscle growth occurs on the negative rep (also known as the ""down phase""). For example, when doing the Bicep curl, it's lowering the weight down that it's building the muscle. Take 3 seconds to lower the weight for beginners, 5 seconds for advance trainers. You should experience Delay Onset of Muscle Soreness happening in 2 days (which is the norm for muscle growth). This type of training will force your muscle to get torn down, then your body will repair it and grow new tissue to support the work load.

, There is no question about this, sleep is essential for recovery, repair and growth. 7 to 8 hours of sleep is optimal for muscle growth.

Visit your doctor.,
See a physical therapist.,
Focus on strengthening uninjured areas.,
Try low-impact exercises for aerobic fitness.,
Stretch.,
Stay motivated.,
Rest!,
Eat well.",How to Keep in Shape With an Injury," He or she will probably have suggestions for a fitness program, as well as specific things you can and cannot do. Always listen to your doctor.;
, If your doctor recommends physical therapy, it's a great way to safely maintain fitness. Most physical therapists use a combination of stretching and strengthening in their programs.

, Even if you never bothered to strengthen these areas before, full-body fitness will improve your performance in almost any sport. Some easy exercises that don't require a gym membership are: push-ups, crunches, calf-raises, bridges, bicep curls, and squats.

, Even if you've injured your lower body, it may still be possible to bike or swim. Ask your doctor. If this isn't possible, many repetitions of an exercise can get your heart pumping. For example, try holding a 5lb weight in each hand and move your arms back and forth as if you were jogging.

, Many athletes don't realize that flexibility is an important component of fitness. Flexibility reduces the risk of injury and allows your body to perform better. Start stretching now so you can return to your sport without stiffness, soreness, or worse, re-injury.

, It can be hard to stick to an exercise regimen when you're injured. Especially if you're watching your teammates having a blast, it can be tempting to give up entirely. Keep trying! Find a friend to work out with or write down an exercising schedule. Above all, remember that you WILL recover someday.

, If you tend to push yourself too hard, an injury can be your body's way of forcing you to take a break. With some injuries, it is best to forget about fitness for a while and give your body a chance to rest and rebuild.

, Without your usual training regimen, your metabolism will slow down and you won't need as much food. Make sure the food you do eat is healthy. Even if you're depressed about your injury and want to stuff your face with doughnuts, remember that those extra pounds will only make returning to your sport that much harder.

Plan ahead.,
During layover or on a short break off the road, make a space and a time for physical exertion.,
Once settled, take advantage of any amenities your hotel offers.,
Choose to walk.,
Do compact exercises.,
Once home, pick up your old routine.",How to Maintain an Exercise Regimen While Traveling," Pack exercise clothing, including shoes and cold or wet weather outer garments. Review your route for parks, open space greens on airport grounds, and rest stops.;
, Walk briskly for a few minutes to warm cramped and cold muscles, then open up and jog for as long as your itinerary will allow. And besides, who would think you odd for running through an airport? Stretch before reembarking.

, Most hotels house at least small fitness rooms equipped with weights and machines in addition to pools and greens. As travelers often find after a long day in the air or on the road, exhaustion may limit the amount of exercise you can comfortably manage, at least without being off your game the next day.   

, If you find yourself within walking distance of your intended destination (coffee shop, conference center, etc.), do so instead of taking a taxi. Walk briskly but avoid running with a ""face forward"" destination, especially in any clothing other than jogging apparel, as this can cause unrest in those around you.

, If your space is severely limited such as a cramped hotel room, try space conserving exercises. Sit-ups, flutter-kicks, push-ups, bracing in half-squat, and lifting improvised weights (luggage, wet towels, etc.) can burn some big calories and keep you fit. Be mindful of your neighbors--above, below, and to the sides--as many of these exercises are loud and repetitive. 

, Allow for several days of reconditioning if you've lost some ground.

Do at least one exercise for each of the main muscle groups.,
Aim to weight train two to three times per week.,
If you are new to strength training, or returning after a long lay off, begin with one set of each exercise, and increase the number of sets only when you begin to feel comfortable.,In general, I would recommended doing 8 to 12 repetitions per exercise

,
Progressively increase the amount of resistance you use.,
Try not to rush your movement when performing the exercises.,
Do a full range of exercises.,
Maintain proper technique.",How to Keep Fit in Your 50s," (i.e chest, back, and legs). There is no need to worry too much about shoulders, biceps and triceps, as you can't do an upper body pushing or pulling exercise without using them.;
, Recent studies haves shown two times per week to be at least as productive as three times per week.

,


The training resistance or weight load should be between 60 to 90 percent of maximum to increase muscle size and strength.

,, As soon as you can do 12 to 15 repetitions, with the proper form, raise the weight by five to ten percent. (which for most seniors translates into one to three pounds or one and a half kilos).

, try to use a pace of two seconds up (concentric phase) and four seconds down (eccentric phase).

, Full range exercise is necessary for building full range muscle strength. So always try to perform each exercise through the complete range of joint movement, taking your muscles from their fully extended position to their fully contracted position and back.

, In addition to controlled movement speed and full movement range, exercise technique is critical when training older adults. Seniors should always practice proper posture when performing strength exercises with particular emphasis on body stability and back support.

Get plenty of sleep.",How to Improve Your Reflexes," They may be purchased at most sporting goods stores. Take one of these, or a simple quarter-machine bouncy ball, and toss it against an outdoor wall. Focus on catching the ball as it bounces back in your direction. Once your reflex time improves, throw the ball harder, challenging yourself to leap and dive to catch it.;
, For the days when you’re feeling more low key, grab a set of jacks. This classic children’s game comes with a small ball and twelve metal pieces. Start by lightly bouncing the ball and picking up as many jacks as possible. As you get better at the game, challenge yourself by bouncing the ball with greater speed. You may also spread the jacks farther apart to increase the game’s difficulty.

, For this exercise, you need a large rubber or foam ball and a friend. Stand in front of a wall, either in a gym or outside in front of a building. Have your partner pitch the ball at you from a distance of ten or so feet away while you practice dodging it. As you get better at dodging the ball, ask your partner to throw it faster and from a closer distance.


To make this exercise more difficult, recruit a second pitcher to throw another ball quickly after you have dodged the first one.
Ask the pitchers to increase unpredictability by faking throws, throwing from different angles, and so on.
Playing dodgeball as a team sport is also a great way to improve reflexes. Practice fielding balls and kicking those that are pitched to you.

, Table tennis, or ping pong, is a great sport to help you improve your reflexes and hand-eye coordination. You can find tables or tabletop setups relatively affordably online or at many sporting goods stores. Alternatively, you can join a local table tennis group or club, which will allow you to face off with different partners and take on greater challenges as you work to improve your reflexes.If you have never played table tennis before, a local club or group might be beneficial, as they can help you understand the basics of the game including form and skill-building.

, Many sports including hockey, tennis, badminton, racquetball, and lacrosse are great activities to help you build your reflexes. Look for an athletic activity where you have to manipulate an object such as a ball using a tool such as a racket or stick. These sports generally require quick reaction, and can help you build both reflexes and situational awareness., Since it requires no special equipment or exercise partners, running in the woods may be the easiest way to begin improving your reflexes. Simply find the closest nature trail - preferably one with varied terrain, rather than a wide path - and start running. The uneven footing and unpredictable roots and rocks you’ll dodge will create a variety of stimuli to which your body will have to quickly react. The more often you hit the trail, the quicker your reflexes will get.


Begin by running at a slow speed. As you feel your reflexes improve over time, push yourself to run faster. Nature trails have a generally higher risk of injury, so it's important to start slow.
Mix things up by choosing a different trail whenever possible. If you get too used to one particular trail, your brain will remember obstacles, and you won’t be improving your reflexes.
Run the same trail in the other direction if you don’t live close to many nature trails.

, Having a quick reaction time is dependent on being keenly aware of what’s coming. You can strengthen your ability to perceive obstacles and flying objects by paying more attention to your peripheral vision during everyday activities.


Look out a window that has a good view and focus your vision on a distant object. Keep looking at this object while you slowly let yourself become more aware of the objects that surround it on either side. Do this exercise once a day, widening your field of vision a little more each time. Gradually, you’ll get in the habit of noticing more objects in your peripheral vision.
While taking a walk or riding in a car, make a point of noticing objects that pop up in your peripheral vision. Practice naming the color of people's hair and the make and model of passing cars as fast as you can.
Check out the video below for martial arts techniques used to improve peripheral vision.

, Playing video games well requires good hand-eye coordination. You must be able to move from thought to action without pause or you’ll quickly lose the game. Studies show that playing video games for a few minutes each day can help improve reflexes. First person shooters and role-playing games often require the most coordination, but any video game will do the trick., Some people have found that a hypnosis technique called neuro-linguistic programming helps increase their awareness of a particular object, giving them the sensation that time has slowed down and they have more than enough time to react. Picture a sports movie that shows a quarterback watching a football arc toward him in slow motion. The football is not actually moving more slowly, of course, but according to its practitioners, neuro-linguistic programming can make it seem that way.

, Cultivate mindfulness through regular meditation or by focusing on the present moment. Clear your head and try to focus all of your attention on what is happening directly around you. Dismiss thoughts of the past or future and instead focus directly on the sights, sounds, and sensations in the current moment.This will help you build awareness of surroundings that will allow you to notice more and potentially react more readily in situations.

, Keeping your body and brain in optimal shape is imperative if you want quick reflexes. Foods high in refined sugars and trans fats can make you feel sluggish. Make sure you are getting enough protein, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats.


Whole foods like nuts, fish, berries, greens, and garlic increase cognitive function.Make sure to drink plenty of water as well, since dehydration can also lead to lethargy and decreased reflex times.

, Certain nutritional supplements are said to lead to improved reflexes. Ginseng, Gingko, Vitamin B12, Vitamin C, and Omega 3’s have all been cited as dietary supplements that may be worth taking for better cognitive function and reaction times.

, According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), sleep helps you have quicker reflexes and perform on a higher level than you otherwise would.Both your body and brain slow down when you’re sleepy, resulting in impaired reflex reactions. Your reflexes will be quickest when you’re well-rested after seven to nine hours of sleep.


A good night's sleep is made up of four or five sleep cycles, each of which consist of a period of deep sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. This adds up to seven to nine hours per night.
If you didn't sleep well the night before an important race or game, taking a nap a few hours before the event will help you be more alert when it's time to perform.

Allow recovery time.",How to Increase the Number of Sit Ups You Can Do," The reverse crunch is the opposite of a traditional crunch, and it can help not only strengthen the abs but may also work to improve posture. Include reverse crunches in your ab workouts to help strengthen your core. To do a reverse crunch:Start by lying on the ground with your back flat, arms straight by your sides with your knees bent at 90 degrees and held close together. Place the soles of your feet flat to the mat.
Press your back into the floor and pull in from the area around your belly button to lift your feet up off the floor. Keep your knees together.
Use your core muscles to pull your knees toward your chest, maintaining the 90 degree bend in your knees and keeping the heels of your feet away from your butt and your shins parallel to the ceiling. This should raise your tailbone off the ground. Bring your knees in as close to your chest as possible, using your core to control your motion.
Do not push up on your arms. Only use them for balance.
Hold the pose for a second before bringing your legs back down to the start position in a controlled motion. Repeat for the recommended amount of reps, typically eight to ten per set.;
, Side planks are a great exercise for strengthening the core. They target some of the smaller core muscles that are easy to neglect, and thus help you build more complete strength in this part of your body. Side planks are more difficult than regular planks, so you won’t be able to hold them as long. Instead, aim for short holds starting at around 10 seconds and work your way up.Start by lying on your side with your feet together and one forearm directly below your shoulder.
Contract your core and raise your torso up off the ground until your body forms a straight diagonal line from your head to your feet.
Hold this position for your set interval of time. Avoid letting the hips drop or sag while you hold.
Once time is up, allow your body to come back to the ground. Then, repeat the motion on your other side.

, Windshield wipers help to strengthen the external obliques, a set of muscles that run from your hips down to your pelvis. They also add a bit of lower back strengthening to help keep you in good form during your sit-ups.Lie on your back with your arms out to your sides. Lift your legs straight up into the air.
Slowly lower your legs to your left, being careful not to let your upper body twist from it center position. Bring your legs over as far as they will go and hold for a second.
Slowly bring your legs back to center.
From center, lower your legs as far as they will go down to your right side. Hold for a second before returning to center.
Use a bent leg if necessary to make the exercise more achievable, and work toward a straight leg as you progress.

, Cobra is a yoga pose, or asana, that can help stretch out and lengthen the core muscles. It can be practiced on its own as a stretch during core workouts, or can be incorporated into a regular yoga flow.Start by lying face down on the mat with your arms bent so that your palms are flat on the ground near your chest.
Breathe in and lift your head, shoulders, and chest up and away from the mat, pulling your shoulder blades together and toward your heels.
Hold for two to three deep breaths, then let your body slowly return to its starting position.
Repeat eight to ten times if performing the movement as a stretch.

, When you start a sit-up, you should be lying face-up on the ground with your knees bent and your feet flat. Arms should be bent with the fingers just touching the side of the head.Remember to keep your feet flat throughout the exercise. If you notice your feet coming off the ground, it might be necessary to adjust their position.
Your hands should not be holding your head, as they could be used to exert force on the neck, which can lead to injury. Instead of placing the full hand under your head, place just your fingers to give some support to the neck without pulling on your head.

, It is easy to recreate the look of a sit-up by lifting with your shoulders and legs, but a true sit-up should come predominantly from your abdominal muscles. As you sit up, take note of where in your body the lift is coming from. If you feel greater strain in your neck, shoulders, or legs than you do in your core, focus on engaging your abs.As you sit up, focus on contracting your core. Check core contractions by placing a hand just below your belly button. When you come up, you should feel a gentle tightening in the area. Pull your body weight up from this area as you sit up., Just as it was necessary to engage your core to bring your body up, you need to use your core to lower your body down to the start position again. Coming down too fast or too hard may force you to work harder to get back up, thereby exhausting you sooner.Lower yourself back down to the starting position, instead of letting gravity simply pull you down. Keep your lower back relaxed, and slowly release your contracted core muscles to lower yourself.

, If you want to do more sit-ups overall, it is first important to make sure you can do sit-ups well. Without proper form, you may not get all the benefits of the exercise, and could increase your risk of injury. Dedicate time during your weekly workout routine to focus on doing multiple sets of sit-ups slowly to improve form.Take ten or so minutes one or two times a week and use that time to do three or four sets of sit-ups slowly. Focus on your form, making sure your body is in the correct position and that you are engaging your abs.Taking time to focus on form can help build muscle memory, which will aid you in being able to do more sit-ups in a beneficial way later on.

, Building the strong core muscles necessary to increase your sit-up count requires both exercise and nutrition. While it is not necessary to eat extra protein to build muscle, getting adequate protein is very important. Generally speaking, to build muscle, you need around 0.8g of protein per pound of body weight.As a general rule of thumb, around 15 to 20 percent of the calories you eat daily should come from protein.
Try to incorporate lean protein foods such as chicken, turkey, fish, legumes, and quinoa into your daily diet., Even if your goal is to be able to do more sit-ups, you will get more out of a holistic exercise routine than you will focusing on a single exercise. Develop a routine that incorporates strengthening your core, strength training other parts of your body, and building up endurance through activities such as sports or cardio.Try to not focus everyday on building up your core. When you build up your core, your exercises exhaust the muscles, and they require time to rebuild. Give yourself two to three days in between major core workouts to allow your muscles to recover.When you are not focusing on building your core, turn your attention to building endurance through a sport or cardio exercise, or improve strength in other areas that help support your abs, such as your back and chest.

, In addition to diversifying your workout, allow one or two days a week for your body to completely rest and recover. These days serve an important role in allowing the entirety of your body to recover. Build rest days into your workout schedule and stick to them.Rest days don’t mean no activity at all. Instead, try a fun activity like a bike ride through town or an easy hike, or work on stretching and recovering your muscles."

Drink 9-13 cups of fluids daily.,
Stay hydrated when you’re sick.,
Don't rely on sports drinks alone to boost electrolytes.,
Go to the hospital for an IV if you get really dehydrated.,
Avoid over-hydrating.",How to Increase Electrolytes1," Salt and water stay in and leave your body together, so keeping a balanced fluid level is important. In general, men should drink around 13 cups of water and other fluids daily (about 3 liters), and women should aim for 9 cups (2.2 liters).Water, juice, and tea count towards your fluids. Stay hydrated every day – it’ll help keep your electrolytes in balance during and after a workout.Try to drink about 500ml (17 ounces) of fluid about two hours before you exercise.;
, Vomiting, diarrhea, and high fevers can cause dehydration and lower your electrolytes. The best way to prevent this is to stay hydrated with water, broth, tea, and sports drinks. Including soup and beverages that contain salt will help keep your electrolytes and fluid levels balanced while you’re sick., Sports drinks like Gatorade are marketed towards athletes, but they’re not necessarily the best choice to replenish the electrolytes you lose from sweating. Many sports drinks contain a lot of sugar in addition to the salt your body needs. Some sugar is good after exercise, but possibly not as much as these drinks contain. Try to replenish your electrolytes naturally with healthy food options.


Coconut water is a good way to rehydrate more naturally than with sports drinks, and coconut water contains many needed electrolytes., Signs of dangerous dehydration in adults include extreme thirst, urinating little or not at all (or very dark urine), fatigue, dizziness, and confusion.If you have these symptoms, you may need an IV of water and salt to replenish your fluids and electrolytes. Call your doctor right away or go to the hospital.


Children may demonstrate dehydration differently. Look for crying without tears, a dry mouth or tongue, no wet diapers over 3 hours, sunken eyes, cheeks, or soft spot on top of their skull, irritability, or listlessness.

, It is possible to drink too much water. When you drink more than your kidneys can filter, you retain water and can throw off your electrolyte balance.It’s important to stay hydrated while exercising, but if you’re drinking a lot of water and start to feel nauseated, confused, disoriented, or get a headache, you may be over-hydrating.


Don’t drink more than a liter of fluid every hour.
When sweating a lot, drink half water and half sports drinks that contain electrolytes.

Learn to recognize good posture.",How to Improve Your Posture at Work1," The first step in improving your posture is learning what good posture feels like. Many people have formed bad posture habits over years or decades, so what feels comfortable may not be good posture.


Stand in front of a mirror facing sideways for the first portion of the test. Put on a belt if you do not already have 1 on already, as it will help you diagnose problems. Stand up as you normally would, so you can accurately assess your posture. Look at your belt to see if it is level all the way around your body. If the back of your belt is higher, then your pelvis is likely tilted forward from sitting regularly. This creates a swayback position that hyper extends your knees and over arches your lower back. To correct this, tilt your pelvis backwards. This is called ""tucking your pelvis"" and requires you to flex your lower abdominal muscles as you tip your pelvis until your belt is even. Then, bend your knees very slightly.
Test your shoulder posture. Stand with your back to a flat wall. When your back touches the wall, if only your lower shoulder blades touch the wall, you have slumped shoulders, a condition with computer workers that often results in breathing problems and chronic back and neck pain. To fix this, squeeze your shoulder blades together and drop them down away from your ears. Check that your pelvis and knees are still in the correct position.
Check your head and neck posture. If the back of your head does not automatically touch the wall as you stand against it, you probably suffer from forward head posture from leaning toward your computer. To correct this, tuck your chin and touch the back of your head to the wall. Pay attention that you do not arch your neck. Tucking your chin should lengthen the back of your neck and force your eyes to automatically look straight across from you.
Repeat this test 3 to 4 times per day, correcting your posture. Once you know what good posture feels like, you can create a better work environment that will foster better posture.;

, On Mondays, all 'a' exercises will be performed. All 'b' exercises will be performed on Wednesdays, and 'c' exercises will be performed on Fridays. Low to medium intensity cardio is optional on non-weightlifting days.

, Before exercising, you should always perform a warm-up. This usually consists on 5-15 minutes of light cardio like jogging or stationary bike, and light stretching (nothing intense!).

, You should perform 2 to 4 sets that should last 40-120 seconds each. Research has shown that the length of time the muscle is under tension is what increases endurance, rather than a number of repetitions.

, Part of what makes lifting for endurance different from lifting to build muscle is the shorter rest periods between sets. You should be working more than you are resting.

,
Correct form should be used at all times. No cheating!
Try some advanced techniques such as “running the rack.”

, Write down the weight used for each exercise every time you go to the gym. If possible, also write down the approximate amount of time performing each set.

, Your muscles improve by adapting, so every workout must put a little more strain on your muscles for continual improvement. If you cannot increase the weight safely, add one more set than last week.

, As a beginner, you should take a 9-12 day rest period of no weightlifting after four to five weeks of training to allow your body to recover fully. When you begin working out again, you may not want to start with the same weight you previously ended with; depending on how much you have improved, you will probably want to decrease the weight from your last workout.

, Your body will need proper nutrition for your muscles to recover optimally. A balanced diet containing carbohydrates, fats, and protein is recommended, but in general you will need to increase the total amount of food you eat to compensate for the increased demands you are placing on your body.


There are countless resources concerned with nutrition.

, Supplements are never necessary as long as you are eating a balanced diet. However, there are some supplements which may help your muscles to improve quicker and recover faster. Do your research before trying any supplements. There are many sites, but examine.com is among the most accessible and reliable for supplement information. Some common supplements are:


Whey Protein Powder
Multivitamins
Creatine
Caffeine

, After some time, your body will have adapted too well to this program to make optimal gains, so it is important to change things up every now and then. Try changing some of the exercises, and try grouping the exercises differently (for example, try doing the chest, back, and triceps exercises on Monday and Thursday, and perform the legs, shoulders, and biceps exercises on Tuesday and Friday).

Eat something salty after you sweat.,
Replace chloride with a snack.,
Eat foods rich in potassium.,
Eat calcium-rich foods.,
Munch on magnesium-rich foods.,
Include other electrolyte-rich foods in your diet.",How to Increase Electrolytes2," You lose a lot of sodium from your body when you sweat heavily – that’s why sweat is salty! After your workout, sit down and have a salty snack like a bagel with peanut butter or a handful of peanuts.Nuts are a healthy high-sodium food, unlike other salty items from the snack-food aisle.

, Chloride gets lost in sweat alongside sodium. Snack on a healthy chloride-rich food after exercising such as olives, rye bread, seaweed, tomatoes, lettuce, or celery., After a heavy workout, it’s good to include some potassium-rich foods in your meal to increase your body’s potassium supply. You should also eat lots of foods high in potassium if you take a diuretic medication. Some good examples include avocadoes, bananas, baked potatoes, bran, carrots, lean beef, milk, oranges, peanut butter, legumes (beans and peas), salmon, spinach, tomatoes, and wheat germ., Naturally increase your calcium level by eating foods that contain good amounts of calcium, like dairy. Milk, yogurt, cheese, and cereals can be included in every meal. Other good foods for calcium include green leafy vegetables, oranges, canned salmon, shrimp, and peanuts.Most athletes need at least three servings of dairy every day to get enough calcium, and teenagers should get at least four servings. A serving may be a 250ml glass of milk, a 200g tub of yogurt, or two slices (about 40g) of cheese., Your body needs magnesium for muscles and nerves to function properly, so include some foods that contain magnesium in your diet. Good options are green leafy vegetables, whole grains, nuts, beans, and lentils., Some foods contain a number of electrolytes that you can nibble on after a workout, or just include in your daily diet to keep electrolyte levels balanced. Snack on chia seeds, kale, apples, beets, oranges, and sweet potatoes."

Increase your vitamin D. Having low vitamin D can decrease your phosphate and calcium levels, so try to increase your vitamin D by getting some daily sun.,
Quit smoking.,
Stop drinking alcohol.,
Don’t starve yourself.",How to Increase Electrolytes3," Spend about 20 minutes in the sun with exposed skin each day – though don’t stay out unprotected long enough to get sunburned. Try to eat foods high in vitamin D, such as mushrooms, oily fish like mackerel or salmon, fortified grains, tofu, eggs, dairy, and lean pork.Your doctor can diagnose low vitamin D with a blood test. Ask whether you should take a vitamin D supplement.

, Smoking and using tobacco products can lower your body’s calcium level. Quit smoking to improve your health and help regulate your body’s calcium, an important electrolyte., Alcoholism is a common cause of low electrolytes. If you’re struggling with drinking too much alcohol, work with your doctor to quit. You can try to quit on your own, but professional help will keep you safer – it’s important for a doctor to monitor your liver, kidney, pancreas, and electrolyte levels if you’ve been drinking a lot and need to stop., Starvation diets are dangerous for many reasons, including the havoc they wreak on your electrolyte levels.Stay away from diets promising you will lose a large amount of weight in a short time, and diets that suggest eating all or mostly one food type. Even the raw food diet and juice cleanses can throw off your electrolyte balance.If you’re trying to lose weight, eat a healthy and balanced diet. Consider working with your doctor or a dietitian to create meal plans.

Talk to your doctor about your medications.,
Manage medical causes of water retention.,
Manage medical conditions that lower electrolytes.,
Get help for dangerously low electrolytes.",How to Increase Electrolytes4," Some medications are notorious for decreasing your electrolytes, especially diuretics like hydrochlorothiazide or Furosemide.Speak with your doctor about your medications and whether you should work together to switch to a different medicine, especially if you’re very active and sweat a lot. Never stop taking your medication without your doctor’s approval. Other medications that may lower electrolyte levels include:


Some antibioticsLaxatives
SteroidsBicarbonate
Proton pump inhibitorsCyclosporine
Amphotericin B
AntacidsAcetazolamide
Foscarnet
Imatinib
Pentamidine
Sorafenib

, Your electrolytes can be low if you’re retaining water due to a medical condition. This can occur because of heart failure, kidney problems, or liver disease, and pregnancy. Medical conditions should be managed with medications under your doctor’s supervision to prevent lowering your electrolytes to dangerous levels. Your OB/GYN can help you regulate your fluid levels while you’re pregnant.


Other signs that your body is retaining too much water is swelling in your legs, or difficulty breathing when you’re lying down.You might also experience changes in heart rate or blood pressure, shortness of breath, or a wet cough with frothy spit up.The condition SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone) is less common, but can also lower electrolytes., Many medical conditions can directly or indirectly decrease your electrolytes. Work with your doctor to medically manage conditions to avoid having dangerously low electrolyte levels. Be aware that the following conditions can lower various electrolytes:


Celiac diseasePancreatitis
Parathyroid problems (your parathyroid working too much or too little)
Diabetes - you might feel thirsty all the time and therefore over-hydrate if you have uncontrolled diabetes

, You can usually manage your electrolyte levels at home with proper hydration and diet, but if your levels get too low it can cause dangerous physical problems. If this occurs, you will likely have symptoms ranging from weakness to heart palpitations. Get medical treatment at the hospital if you feel unwell, which will vary depending on the severity of your symptoms and how low your electrolyte levels are:


Oral medications like pills are available for low potassium, magnesium, and calcium.
IV medications are available at the hospital for dangerously low potassium,calcium,magnesium,and phosphate."

Do your research.,
Keep to a routine.,Be sure to stretch after completing workout.,
Have a healthy diet.,
Exercise.,
Do Circuit training.,
Don't put too much faith in commercials.,
Focus on other things as well.,
Stay motivated.,
Know how well you are doing.",How to Improve Your Fitness," If you are seriously wanting to improve your fitness, then you have to do research on your goal. You might want to try to find out what are good fats and bad fats, what exercises to do for what part of the body and how long you need to exercise for. This can greatly help you to make a better fitness routine and also know in detail what to do to improve your fitness.;
, Organize a routine for yourself according to your research. Consult a fitness expert if you know where to get one. He or she can make a plan for individual needs. This is important that once you made a routine, you follow it properly never letting up. An example routine could be:


Monday- sit ups or core exercises and leg exercise
Tuesday- Cardio workout and arm and back exercise
Wednesday- Rest
Thursday- Working all muscle groups
Friday- Cardio
Saturday- Rest
Sunday- Weight and free-weight exercises

,, Your calorie intake is the foundation of improving fitness. Do not eat when you are emotional, eat when you are hungry and then burn those extra calories so there is not any excess fat in your body. Small changes such as eating an apple in place of saturated fats, drinking water instead of soda, cutting out one less tablespoon in your diet, etc. can make a huge difference. Drink at least 10-16 ounces of water about 30 minutes before a meal or a snack. This makes you feel full, meaning you won't eat as much. A balanced diet is very important to improving your fitness and maintaining it. Exercising without food is bad as the body will hold onto any bad fats in your body meaning the fat stays there, same goes with when you enter starvation phase. Try to follow the south beach diet, it may help you lose fat and improve your fitness. Have proteins daily in your lifestyle.

, To really improve your fitness or maintain it, do various types of exercises. For weight training, hit each muscle group as you want the main muscle groups of the body to break its fibers during exercise and then strengthen themselves while in the rest phase. The key to strengthening your muscles is doing an exercise at high intensity and either increase sets or reps (repetitions) over time. So say you did 50 sit ups yesterday, maybe increase the number to 55 today. But increase in moderation; you will not get a body builder physique overnight. If you're able to watch television while doing your exercise, basically you're not working hard enough and not challenging your muscles. Here are some exercises you might want to try: squats for the thighs and legs, rear leg lifts, push ups, pull ups, bicep curls, sprinting, sit ups and other types of stomach exercises. Make sure you do exercises so your whole body is strengthened. Remember not to overwork yourself. You will not let your muscles rest and strengthen themselves and it will cause fatigue in your muscles so exercising will become difficult. It can also cause cramps as well.



Participate in sports. This will not only teach the sport skills but it will improve your fitness so next time there's a school football team, or a gym wants more boxers, don't miss the chance, grab it.

, If you want to improve your fitness, try to do circuit training. Circuit training is doing different exercises for different parts of your body in rotation. This is not only to have a balanced body for looks, but also to prevent injury. For example, if you are doing 80lb bicep curls, but have a weak lower back, you could sprain your back! For circuit training you can try to do: pull ups-arms, sit ups-stomach, squats-thighs, rear leg lifts-legs, sprinting-endurance, push up-arms, crunches-stomach and an exercise to strengthen your back.

, The truth is that you have to ignore all those commercials when they advertise foods that are useless for your body, fitness machines and supplements. It is hard, you are wanting to improve your fitness real bad so you want all those machines to gain that extra edge. But that draw is exactly why so many people make these kind of products - they know the products will sell. Stick to tried and true methods and products instead. For example a treadmill, jump rope, step board, bench, dumbbells. Instead of buying expensive supplements, cut out the excess fat and eat food that is useful to speed up your metabolism.

, If your exams are coming up, focus on that, and reduce the time you spend on fitness. However, don't put it off completely, otherwise you will suffer a setback!

, Sometimes you are tired of working out too much, the reason might be you're not motivated. Look at how your sports role models never give up and train beyond their comfort zone. Or listen to your favorite music as it might get motivate you to go beyond your comfort zone. Post success stories and quotes on the wall so when your training you can see them. Another tip to get motivated is to join a group exercise class. You will meet a lot of people there, and the group environment greatly helps motivation. (""If the 40 year old pregnant lady can get up at 5am and come to class, I can too!"")

, Periodically measure your fitness. You can use a physical measurement such as bicep size, or a time such as how fast you can run a mile. Record these measurements. This will keep you motivated to see your improvements or to see how much you need to improve. Remember though, that these are long-term goals and your body doesn't necessarily improve every single day; have patience!

Adjust your office chair so your knees are at a 90 degree angle.,
Find a lumbar support.,
Trade your desk chair for an exercise ball for increments of 10 to 20 minutes.,
Adjust your computer screen.,
Ensure your hands rest on your keyboard at a 90 degree angle.,
Get up and walk around every 20 to 30 minutes.",How to Improve Your Posture at Work2," Your feet should be planted firmly on the ground at a hip's width apart. Your butt should be at the back edge of the cushion.


If you are short, you may want to invest in a small foot rest on which you can place your feet to create the 90 degree angle.

, Ideally, all office chairs should have a small curve that fits into the curve on your lower back. If your chair does not include lumbar support, buy a lumbar support cushion to place behind your lower back.

, Find an exercise ball that allows you to keep the 90 degree angle in your legs and reach your keyboard. 2 or 3 times per day, replace your chair with the ball and sit up straight.


One of the main elements of good posture is core strength. Exercise balls create an instability that forces your abs and back muscles to work. However, you can overuse a ball very easily, causing muscle fatigue. Start out small with merely 10 minutes of use and work your way up to more minutes and periods on the ball every week. Return to sitting in your normal chair after no more than 20 minutes.

, The top third of your computer screen should be at the same level as your eyes, although most people have it much lower. Prop it up on books or reams of paper and make sure it is between 18 and 24 inches (46 to 61 cm) from your face.

, Your hands should rest on the keyboard or desk, so if you find yourself holding them up, buy a wrist rest to place in front of your keyboard.

, Probably the most overlooked element of office ergonomics and posture, is the necessity of moving around regularly to avoid the shortening of muscle fibers and increase in muscle tension. Walk around the office for a few minutes after 30 minutes of sitting to avoid bad posture.


Download a timer application, such as TimeMe Timer Stopwatch. Some computer timers can be set to sound an alarm after 30 minutes, while others may momentarily shut down your computer or monitor. Reset the timer each time you return to ensure you get up and walk around regularly.

, Recently, researchers have found that there is less stress on the back when you are reclining. If your chair adjusts, move it slightly backward to a 100 degree angle instead of a 90 degree angle.

, Frequently imagine pulling that string straight up toward the ceiling. You should aim to move your entire body upward through your center, instead of arching your back.

, Studies have shown that people's risk of death increases in the next 3 years if they sit over 11 hours. It is drastically reduced if a person sits for 4 hours or less per day. You can improve your odds by doing active things after and before work, instead of sitting while watching TV.

, These desks rely on hydraulics to allow them to move up and down vertically. After 20 minutes of sitting, you can move it to a standing position, where you will improve your posture and your overall health, while working.

, The best way to improve your posture is to exercise and stretch your core muscles regularly. Pilates classes can teach you how to flex your muscles in a way that will support your spine.

If you're always hungry after you exercise, and therefore eat more: This most likely has more to do with your choice of diet rather than your actual workout.,
If you've started a workout regime but gained weight: There are two reasons that may be causing this;


When you first start regular exercise it's likely that your body is building up muscle more quickly than it's burning fat.,
If you have a friend who's thinner than you, but who always seems to be snacking: Metabolism, height and age all play a role in this, but remember that snacking can actually be good if you do it right.,
If you've been exercising lots, lost weight, but still can't get rid of your cellulite: Less fat does not equal less cellulite.,
If your exercise routine is boring you and making you loose motivation:


Try adding a new class such as Zumba or Pilates to your routine to add variety.,
If you don't like going to the gym but still want to work out: Workout DVDs will give you the same results as going to the gym, but only if you stick to it and really push yourself.,
If you've managed to lose weight, but still aren't happy with your stomach: Make sure you're not overdoing your workout as this can cause your body to panic and cling onto a bit too much fat.",How to Improve Your Workout Regimen," By eating foods such as fruit, vegetables, yoghurt and lean meat, you should feel less hungry than if your diet consists of foods such as cheese, bread, pasta and biscuits. This is because the fiber in fruit and vegetables helps to fill you up.;
, However this is OK because muscle burns 9x as many calories.






There is a danger that you might eat more if you think that you have ""earned it"" by doing exercise. There's no point in piling the calories straight back on if you've just spent time and energy trying to burn them off. Also, you probably presume you've burnt more calories than you actually have, and this can lead to overeating because you think it doesn't matter.







, By spreading your intake of food over the whole day, instead of in three big meals, you prevent your body from getting too hungry, which can cause it to cling onto calories, and you are less likely to eat too much in one sitting which result in the excess being stored as fat. Choose your snacks carefully though, go for fruit, smoothies, cereal bars or low fat yogurts rather than sweets and crisps.

, Try adding more strength exercises which target your problem area to your routine, this creates a foundation of muscle which allows the fat to lie flat on top rather than being lumpy.

, As well as this, joining a class will provide you with support and guidance from the leader and other members.






Mix your workout in with your social life. Try to get a friend involved and either go to classes together or go jogging together. You'll be able to gossip as well as helping each other out to get fit.






Don't always work out in the same place, try going running around different areas of country side or along a canal. If you constantly do the same thing in the same place, you'll get bored and switch off from it.







, Get rid of any distractions such as your phone or the TV for the duration of the time which you want to spend exercising, and when you're doing it, push yourself as far as you can. DVDs should be done about three times a week in order to use them effectively. Also, you'll need to make sure that the exercises which they are providing actually help you to work out your whole body, especially your specific problem areas. Running, swimming, and simply doing your own choice of exercises to some music are all other options if you're not a fan of the gym.

, Or you might not be focusing on your core enough during your workouts. Try adding exercise balls to your exercises, and try pilates to really strengthen your core and firm up your stomach. Also, avoid stress, eating too much salt, chewing gum and caffeine which can all add to a flabby belly.

Set goals.,
Track your progress.,
Start small.,
Include 30 minutes of cardiovascular activity most days.,
Add strength training.,
Take a class.,
Find little ways to move more.,
Consider working with a personal trainer.",How to Improve Physical Fitness1," Having a fitness goal or a series of little goals that you are working towards will help you to stay focused and may even help to keep you motivated. Make sure that you set goals that are SMART (specific, measurable, action-oriented, realistic, and time-based).For example, if you want to exercise every day, you might set your goal as something like, “I will go for a brisk 30 minute walk every morning this week.”;
, Keeping track of your fitness progress is a great way to stay motivated. Tracking your progress can also make it easier to see when you reach a fitness goal. You can track your progress in lots of different ways. Some tracking methods for physical fitness include:


Weight and/or body measurements
Mile time
How much weight you can lift
Number of sit-ups/push-ups you can do
Your ability to hold a difficult pose, such as a plank, for a certain amount of time

, Although it is rare, jumping right into vigorous exercise after being sedentary for a long time can increase your risk of having a heart attack; therefore, it is best to go slow and start with something less intense, such as walking, swimming, or biking.Starting slow will also help to reduce your chances of getting injured, which can put a hold on your fitness efforts.
After a while, you can increase your activity intensity and duration, such as from walking to jogging, or biking on a flat surface to biking on a somewhat hilly surface, or swimming for 45 minutes instead of 30 minutes.
Starting with small, more easily-achieved goals helps people stick with their plans. Drastic changes are harder to stick with — find something that you enjoy and seems doable.

, Cardiovascular activity is an essential part of any plan to improve physical fitness. Exercising for 150 minutes per week (or 30 minutes on five days per week) is recommended, so try to make this amount of activity part of your schedule.As an alternative, you may do 75 minutes of vigorous cardiovascular activity. For example, you could do 15 minutes of kickboxing, stair climbing, or running on five days out of every week.
Keep in mind that exercising for longer is better. If you can fit in 300 minutes of moderate aerobic activity each week, then you will gain more health benefits than if you exercise for 150 minutes per week.

, Strength training is also essential for physical fitness, but you only need to do two strength training workouts each week. Just make sure that these two workouts target all of your major muscle groups. Make sure that you train your arms, legs, abs, back, chest, hips, and shoulders., Exercise classes provide a good workout and a social outlet as well. Group exercise classes may also help you to stay motivated more than working out on your own.Try taking an exercise class such as:


Spinning
Zumba
Step
Yoga
Tai chi
Pilates

, Adding more small bursts of physical activity into your day may also help to improve your physical fitness levels. Even if you only have a few minutes, you can take advantage of this time and get a little extra physical activity into your day.


For example, you could do some sit-ups during a commercial break, park your car further away from the entrance at the grocery store, or take the stairs instead of the elevator. All of these little changes will help to improve your cardiovascular health and build your strength.

, If you have a hard time staying motivated or if you just are not sure where to start, a trainer can help you. Working with a trainer can give your fitness efforts a good jump start and working with a trainer may also make it easier to stick with your program.


A personal trainer can also teach you some effective workout strategies to keep you interested and seeing results. Some personal trainers will also provide you with meal plan ideas and advice about how to maximize your results.

Determine how many calories you need to eat per day.,
Follow a balanced diet.,
Eliminate unhealthy choices.,
Drink lots of water.",How to Improve Physical Fitness2," To improve your physical fitness, you will also need to pay careful attention to your diet. If you are trying to lose weight, then you will need to eat fewer calories than you burn. If you are trying to gain weight, then you will need to eat more.


Keep track of everything you eat. Whether you need to lose weight or gain weight, you will need to keep careful track of how much food you take in every day. Try starting a food diary to keep track of your caloric intake.
Measure your food. Measuring your food is important to ensure that you are not overestimating or underestimating how much food you are taking in on a daily basis. Read the labels on everything you eat and measure out appropriate portions to ensure that you are getting the right amount of calories every day.

, What you put into your body can make a big difference in your results and how you feel. That is why it is important to follow a balanced diet as you work towards your fitness goals. Some things that you should include in your diet are:


Fruits and vegetables, such as bananas, apples, oranges, broccoli, spinach, carrots, and peppers.
Lean protein, such as skinless chicken, wild sockeye salmon, and lean cuts of grass fed beef.
Complex carbohydrates, such a brown rice, whole wheat pasta, whole wheat bread, and quinoa., As you work to include healthier foods in your diet, you should also do what you can to eliminate unhealthy choices. Try to reduce your intake of foods that:Contain high levels of saturated fats, such as butter, cheese, and red meat
Are high in sugar, such as sugary cereals, candy, and baked goods.
Are greasy or fried, such as onion rings, French fries, and deep fried fish
Are highly processed, such as canned soups, crackers, and frozen dinners

, Drinking water will help you stay hydrated and it can also help you to eat less by filling up your stomach temporarily.Try to drink eight 8-ounce (250-ml) glasses of water every day to stay hydrated.


If you have been exercising, then you will need to drink more water to replace the water that your body has lost.
Try swapping water for the beverages that you normally drink, such as juice, soda, and coffee.

See your doctor.,
Lose weight if you are overweight.,
Quit smoking.,
Cut down on alcohol.",How to Improve Physical Fitness3," Before you make any major changes to your activity level or diet, you may want to schedule an appointment with your doctor. Some people have restrictions on diet and exercise levels based on medical conditions, so it is best to check with your doctor before you make major changes to your diet or activity levels.

, Being overweight puts you at a higher risk of developing chronic diseases, such as diabetes, and it may also be preventing you from being as physically fit as you could be. If you are carrying extra weight, then you may want to consider starting a weight loss program.


Keep in mind that you don’t need to lose a ton of weight to see health benefits. Even losing 5% to 10% of your total body weight can help to reduce your blood pressure, lower cholesterol, and improve your blood sugar levels., Smoking can interfere with your fitness goals and it can also lead to life-threatening diseases such as cancer, emphysema, and COPD. If you smoke, then talk to your doctor about treatment options that might make it easier for you to quit. There are prescription medications and smoking cessation programs that may help you to stop smoking.

, Drinking large amounts of alcohol can also make it hard for you to improve your physical fitness. Alcohol adds empty calories to your diet and it can also cause dehydration, fatigue, and other health problems. Do not consume more than one drink per day if you are a woman and no more than two drinks per day if you are a man.If you often binge drink and/or find it hard to moderate your alcohol intake, then you may want to talk to your doctor. You may need to seek treatment to help you stop drinking.

Consult with your physician or physical therapist before starting a new exercise routine.,
Assess your fitness abilities.This allows you to measure your progress and calculates how much you can do incrementally.,
Design a fitness plan.,
Begin with low to moderate-impact activities like walking and running. ,
Warm up with a light stretch routine.,
Set yourself a big goal and everyday work towards that big idea but setting smaller personal goals.,
Complete your workout with a cool down and a longer stretch.

,
Maintain your fitness plan and adjust your workout as needed.

",How to Have More Endurance,";
, Consider recording:


Your pulse rate before and after you walk/run 1 mile (1.6 kilometers)
The length of time it takes you to walk/run 1 mile
How many push-ups and sit-ups you can do
Your body mass index

, Anyone can say they’ll stick to exercising daily but a solid plan will keep you motivated and mindful of your personal targets. Consider the following:


Establish clear goals. Be specific and reasonable. Are you trying to lose weight? If so, how much? Are you training for a marathon? If so, when is it and how much time do you have to train?
Follow a routine. Maintaining aerobic activity for 30 minutes a day, 5 times a week is recommended by most healthcare guidelines.Pace Yourself. Start slow and gradually progress into more intensive workouts. Building endurance is not something which occurs overnight, but over a period of months. Therefore, small steps should be taken.
Recovery. Let your body heal. At least 48 hours is needed in between workouts for your body to heal and for maximum benefit.Do different exercises. Keep it new and exciting to stay motivated. Varied activities also strengthen differed parts of your body. With two types of physical endurance, cardio-respiratory and muscular, you can try bicycling, jogging, walking, swimming, dancing etc.
Write out your plan. Try keeping a journal or a list of your daily routine. Use a whiteboard or chalkboard so it’s larger and easier to remember. Writing it out will keep you on track and driven.

,, Stretch your whole body to avoid the risk of pulled muscles. Stretching also helps to increase your success in a certain time.

, For example, for the first session walk for 5 minutes, then run for 1 minute. For the next session, walk for 10 minutes, and then run for 2 minutes. This may not be the approach everybody takes, but the main part is to be committed, positive, and hard working.


Try walking 100 meters (328.1 ft) then running 100 meters (328.1 ft). Increase the run by 50 meters (164.0 ft) and decrease the walk in the same manner.
Continue to increase tolerance in this way until you are running the entire time.

Determine your budget for the retreat.,

Choose a retreat that fits your fitness goals.,
Learn about scheduling and activities.,

Find out if the retreat allows electronics.,

Focus on your health and wellness while on the retreat.",How to Go on a Fitness Retreat," Start by deciding how much you can afford to spend on the fitness retreat. There are fitness retreats that are more high end and will be fairly expensive, around $3,000 – $5,000 or more per week, not including travel costs. There are also fitness retreats that are more affordable, less than $2,000, not including travel costs. Do your research and compare several fitness retreats to find one that will fit your budget.Make sure you save a decent amount of money to then pay for the retreat. Having savings set aside for the retreat will give you more options and put less stress on you when you go on the retreat.;
, Consider if you want to travel to a new place as part of the fitness retreat. This may depend on your budget and time constraints, as you may or may not have the time off required to travel somewhere for the retreat. Often, finding a fitness retreat that is in your local area will be cheaper than a retreat that you have to pay to travel to, whether you fly or drive.For example, you may find a fitness retreat that is in your hometown or city. You may then be able to afford the cost of the fitness retreat because you do not have to worry about paying for travel costs.
You may also find a retreat that is less expensive but still fits your fitness needs, even with travel costs factored in. For example, a yoga retreat that is two days long in your hometown will be cheaper than a yoga retreat that is two weeks long and out of the country.
You may go for a retreat that you travel to if you are looking for a chance to explore a new country or place and also get fit. Doing a fitness retreat in another country could allow you to do both of these things.

, Go for a fitness retreat that will help you get one step closer to your fitness goals. For example, you may have a fitness goal to lose 10 pounds. Look for a retreat that is more like a bootcamp, with intense workouts and structured meals. Or you may have the fitness goal of improving your yoga practice. You may then opt for a retreat that focuses on yoga.If you have any limitations or injuries, find out if there is a physiotherapist onsite who can assist you with these issues. Ask if they are able to accommodate any special needs due to your injury. For instance, will you be able to modify activities? Will someone be able to work with you on safely exercising your problem area?
Find out if the retreat includes one-on-one time with a trainer who can help you meet your goals, or if this is something you need to pay extra for.

, You will also want to consider whether or not you want a retreat that is structured, with required classes and activities, or more flexible, allowing you to do your own thing, or choose which classes or activities you want to attend and when. Think about what you want to get out of the experience and find a retreat that fits.

Look for a fitness retreat that includes activities and exercises that you enjoy doing. This way, you will get the most out of the retreat fitness-wise. If you are really into Ashtanga yoga, for example, you may go on an Ashtanga yoga retreat. Or if you are really into CrossFit, you may opt for a CrossFit retreat.
Read over the activities offered at the retreat and compare several retreats to find the right one for you. Some retreats combine several different exercises to help you get fit. This may be a good option if you’re open to trying new exercises and want to work out in different ways on the retreat.
Find out how many people are usually in each class or activity, as this can make a big difference in terms of how much personal attention you receive. Will your class have 20 people or five?
If there are required activities or classes, be sure you check the time of day. If you're not a morning person, and the first required class starts at 5am, then that might not be the retreat for you.

, Depending on the retreat, your accommodations may be similar to a four-star hotel, or they may be more rustic or austere. This will certainly influence the price, so see what options there are within your budget.

Find out if you will have your own room, or if you will be sharing with a friend (or stranger if you go alone).
Inquire about the bathrooms. Will your room have its own bathroom or is there a communal set up? On a fitness retreat it is likely you will want to shower multiple times a day, so you'll want to know if you will potentially have to wait in line to use the facilities. In addition, you might want to find out if they only have showers or if there are also bathtubs, as you may wish to soak your sore muscles at the end of the day.
Ask about laundry. Since you're working out all day, you will want to know what to do with those sweaty gym clothes. Is there a laundry facility on-site where you can wash your clothes? Are they complimentary or coin-operated (so you know if you need to bring quarters)? Do you need to send laundry out, and is there an additional fee for this service?
Ask about any ""house rules."" Are there quiet hours or a set time for lights out? Is there a ration on towels? An emphasis on conserving water?

, Fitness retreats can vary widely when it comes to meal options. Your meals may be included in the package cost and prepared for you, or you may be given space to prepare your own meals and have to bring your own food. You may also want to know how much flexibility there is with the meal plan. Are mealtimes set, or can you eat whenever you want? Is it cafeteria-style? A dining room?

You may also want to find out of there is a dietitian on-site to help you plan meals and meet any weight-loss or health goals.
Find out if there is food available to purchase at the retreat, or nearby, or if all food is already provided for you.
Ask about special accommodations if you require them, such as vegetarian food options or allergy-free meals.

, Maybe you want to embark on the fitness retreat solo or perhaps you’d have more fun going with a few friends. Often, fitness retreats will offer discounts or special deals for participants who sign up in pairs or in a group. If you are trying to save money on the retreat, going with someone else may be the way to go.If you are going on the fitness retreat alone, make sure you feel comfortable and safe signing up for the retreat. Going alone can be a good way to stay focused on your fitness goals and give you the opportunity to meet new people at the retreat.

, To help you find the right retreat for you, ask your fitness trainer or people you work out with at the gym. Speak to friends who are fit and ask them if they have gone to a fitness retreat before. Reach out to people in your network who can help you find a good fitness retreat for your budget and your fitness goals.

You can also contact several fitness retreats and ask them questions about the retreat before you sign up. Request a copy of the activities schedule at the retreat.

, To prepare for the fitness retreat, set aside the time required for the retreat. If you have a job, take time off to ensure you can go on the retreat. You may pick a fitness retreat that falls on a holiday weekend so you do not have to take extra time off of work. Or you may use your vacation days at work to go on the retreat.

If you are in school, you may pick a fitness retreat that falls on a holiday weekend or during a school break. This way, you will have the time off necessary to participate in the retreat.
If you have other life commitments, like children or pets, you will need to arrange for someone to care for them while you are on the retreat.

, For instance, if it is a snorkeling retreat, do you need to be a skilled swimmer? If it's a scuba diving retreat, do you need to be certified already? If you need to develop your skills or fitness a little before you are ready for the retreat, make sure you put in the time so you can make the most out of your retreat.

Find out if various skill levels will be accommodated at the retreat or if everyone will be expected to be at the same level. You don't want to go on a retreat that is too advanced for you, nor do you want to be an advanced athlete at a retreat meant for beginners.

, To ensure you have a good time at the fitness retreat, make sure you pack workout clothing that is comfortable. Go for workout clothing made of wicking material so you stay dry while you sweat. Bring comfortable running shoes so you can work out safely during the retreat.You may also pack warmer clothing or clothing you can layer over if the retreat is in a location that is temperate. Going to a retreat in the desert, for example, means you will have cooler nights and warmer afternoons. Pack according to the weather at the fitness retreat.

, If you are going on a retreat for a specific sport, like tennis, you will probably want to bring your own racquet. If the retreat involves equipment-heavy activities like skiing, snorkeling, or golfing, ask if you should bring your own gear or if you can rent or borrow while you are there., Some fitness retreats take the idea of disconnecting literally. You may not be allowed to use electronics like your cellphone, your computer, or other devices. If this is the case, make sure you let others know that you will not be reachable by phone for the duration of the retreat.Some fitness retreats will encourage you to write your thoughts and reflections down in a journal over the course of the retreat rather than online or on your phone. If this is the case, make sure you pack a journal.

, Throw yourself into the planned activities at the retreat so you get the most out of your experience. Some fitness retreats will be more structured and have a list of activities planned for each day. Some fitness retreats will be more loose and give you more time to relax and unwind on your own, in addition to exercising.You may go into the fitness retreat with a fitness goal, such as losing 10 pounds or toning up different parts of your body. Focus on activities at the retreat that will help you to achieve your fitness goal.

, Another key element of the fitness retreat is the chance to bond with others in a relaxing setting. Take the time to get to know the other participants at the retreat. Strike up conversations at meals. Support others during workouts. Exchange personal stories with the other participants.While you are at the retreat, you may try to split your time between a few hours alone with yourself and a few hours around others.

, Some people find it difficult to relax and disconnect at a retreat, especially if they are used to a busy schedule in their daily life. Be open to focusing on your health and wellness while you are at the retreat. Try to stay in tune with your body and workout hard during the fitness classes.Depending on the fitness retreat, you may be able to work closely with the fitness instructors at the retreat to achieve your fitness goals.

Have a Good Night Sleep.",How to Go Beyond Your Lifestyle Potential to Build a Great Physique," While there is no reason for you to spend fortune on supplements, health club memberships, different workouts, special equipment or even steroids, there is some financial investment needed for you to get in shape. However, it’s much lower than you think. One of the excuses people have for not even trying to get in shape is that they don't have enough money. Let’s look at this from the fat loss point of view. You don’t need to buy anything. Because fat loss is a matter of calories, you need to eat less, which means buying less food, which means spending less money. If you are little bit tied on money then the amount you save on food can be invested in a workout program and gym membership. And you don't really need to spend much on things like personal trainers and supplements. Just take a look at this. 12-20 week workout program that is designed to help you build the body shape you desire usually costs around $40 - $80, Gym Membership for 4 weeks usually costs from $30 to $60, Creatine monohydrate for 12 weeks costs around $19. Can you afford this? Besides it’s your body we are talking about. Usually you can find a way to make these investments possible. Unsubscribe from unnecessary TV programs. Save some money on food. There are many ways. Good looking body doesn't take a lot of money, it takes lot of focus and determination among other things.;
, Do you have a problem concentrating on what you want? Do you often multitask? Are you easily distracted? Train yourself to be laser focused on one thing at a time and preferably not the one you don’t want, but the one you desire instead. You may have heard: “You get what you focus on”. Whether it is what you want or not. So, make sure you are focusing on something you truly want. It’s not some positive thinking BS, this is real. Your mind is searching for what it is focused on, it tries to find a way to make it happen. You can imagine that you have a wide database of actions in your head and in the middle of it there is a big search engine, something like your own version of Google. And when you consciously focus on something, your subconscious mind types this term or phrase into your own Google search engine and starts searching for the right answer, action that it should take. You see it doesn’t care if it’s what you want or not if it’s bad for you or not, because it’s what you are focusing on. Look in the past, did you get more things you wanted or more things you focused on? You may be really focused on your goal and trying to do whatever you can, but no matter what your goal is you will face challenges and obstacles. If you are not ready to face them and determined to overcome them you will have a hard time achieving your goal. This is why mastering the skill of being able to focus on what you want is so important. If you give up once there is a little problem on your way, then why have you even started? Remember no matter what you want, you will be tested along the way. By others and mostly by yourself.

, If you go to the gym twice a month then you can stop paying for the membership, because going there is pointless, unless you go there just for fun. For big muscle growth you need to fulfill your lifestyle potential. You don’t have to become a gym rat or some weightlifting freak or even acquire the fitness lifestyle that professional bodybuilders have, but you have to go to the gym regularly. No excuse, unless you got a date with a supermodel or somebody close to you died. This is just another variable in the lifestyle potential equation. You may also see the consistency as your time. Which means that more time you have for the gym, more intensively you can train and more frequently you can go there. There is a difference between a guy who goes to the gym three times a week and between a guy who goes there six times a week. Which one do you think will develop his muscles more? Assuming other variables are the same. And which one are you? So, how much time are you willing and actually can dedicate to working out per session and how many sessions can you do per week?

, Many guys especially the young ones who want to lift as heavy as possible and as soon as possible, don't really care about their health and things like injury prevention. Well, guess what, if you injure yourself, you will be put off the gym for weeks or months, and sometimes even years. And from some injuries you may never recover. So, it’s really important to watch yourself. Master your weightlifting technique. Lift only what you can handle. Focus on the lift and not allow yourself any distraction. Lift heavy and push hard, but remember that strict form comes first. This will allow you to progress more, build more muscle, not feel tired after your workouts and prevent injuries.

, Not only you have to show up in the gym regularly, but you also have to do some hard work there. Developing muscles is a long run commitment, it takes dedication and effort. You cannot expect to get masculine by doing few light curls and presses per week. You have to challenge yourself, stimulate new levels of muscles growth and force your muscles to grow whenever possible. Just hanging around and doing whatever comes to the mind or doing what you feel like doing today is not an answer. Get a proper workout, follow it as it’s written and hit the gym hard. Lifting weights should be slightly uncomfortable and challenging. Get used to hard work. There is a great quote by Paula Abdul that sums it perfectly, “You have to become comfortable in the uncomfortable.”

, Stress has a significant impact on your health, happiness, energy and it even has a direct impact on your fat loss and muscle growth. Less stress is always better. Learn new ways of relaxing, try yoga or Thai chi. If you have a problematic job, try to find a new one, look for new opportunities. If you have troubles in your relationships and social life, find out how can you improve this area of your life. More stress free you will be the more energetic you will be. More energetic you will be the better body you can build.

, Pick a gym that is closest to your home, so you don't have to spend more time driving than you do weightlifting in a gym. Also it should be a place where you are interested in coming back, if there is unfriendly staff you may want to look somewhere else. You need to enjoy your workouts, so make sure you have chosen a gym you will like coming back to.

, For the best muscle growth you should preferably only eat, sleep and train. This is the ideal fitness lifestyle. However, this is not possible and it would also be pretty boring if you had this kind of fitness lifestyle. Not only that, but there is really no point in building a great looking body, if you can't even enjoy it. However, you still need to create good conditions for building a great looking body. Diet is a part of that. If your goal is to lose fat you need to eat below your energy expenditure levels (Basal Metabolic Rate + Daily activities). If you want to maintain your leanness you can eat little bit higher, but no beyond your energy expenditure level. It doesn't matter if you want to lose fat or build muscle, you need to have a balance diet. Get all the macro nutrients and micro nutrients your body needs. You don't need to be obsessed with it, just make sure you provide what your body requires on weekly basis.

, There are so many supplements out there nowadays. And most of them are just junk. Supplements are a billion dollar industry and supplement companies don't need to prove that what they claim their product does is actually true. In other words, the supplement might have a same effect on you as a placebo and they can still sell it and say it will help you put on 20 pounds of muscle. That is exactly how it is, most supplements do not work. However, there are few you can take. These are Creatine monohydrate, Omega 3P Fish oils, BCAA or protein. Protein intake should be around 80-100 grams a day and this need can be met by eating more protein rich food or supplementing with protein or BCAA supplements. If you don’t have enough money for testing supplements then buy only creatine monohydrate, which is so far the only supplement that has been scientifically proven to help with muscle building.Fish oil is great, because most of the people do not eat enough fish, especially if you don't live in seaside resort. But that's it, just creatine, protein and fish oil. Nothing special in here.

, Everybody can respond to training and you can always look better than you do now, no matter how old are you. If you are 50 and you are starting working out, it will be harder and you will never look like somebody your age who was working out since he was 15. But what is important is that you can still look better than you do now, so don't compare yourself to other people and start training and focusing on your transformation. You are neither too young neither too old to start lifting weights and improving your physique. Start today, because there is never a better day. It is just going to be worse. The longer you wait, the harder it will be to get yourself to the gym and get in shape.

, A good night sleep is a must, both in quality and length. You should sleep for about 8-9 hours if you are serious about building some significant muscle mass. Go to sleep before 11pm and try to wake the same time every day. You need to have a proper sleep in order to be productive, energetic during the day and not dizzy and tired. The most successful people on earth are those who have the most energy, so become one of them.

Focus on weight loss and fitness.,
Let someone know where you’re going.,
Stay hydrated on the fitpacking trip.",How to Go Fitpacking," Since you’ll be in natural terrain for a long period of time, it would be wise to use lightweight gear. Visit your local outdoor supply store—such as REI—and peruse their backpacking section. You’ll want a backpack with a lightweight, sturdy frame and hiking boots that offer a firm tread and solid ankle support.


Avoid buying backpacking gear online, since it’s important to feel the gear on your body. You should wear everything before purchasing, and make sure that the backpack, hiking boots, and other outdoor clothes are comfortable and won’t rub or cause painful blisters.
Also, purchase a lightweight sleeping bag that will suit the climate that you’ll be backpacking in.;
, When packing for the fitpacking trip, bring only what you’ll need. Plan to bring a few pairs of hiking socks, a windbreaker or other light jacket, a heavier jacket (depending on the season and location), and wool or synthetic hiking pants (no jeans). Bring a first aid kit as well, in case of emergency, unless the fitpacking group leader has clarified that they’ll bring one.The recommended total weight of your pack should come to about 40 pounds. More weight than this would be exhausting to carry for an entire day.The cost of the fitpacking trip does include two nights spent in a hotel, so you’ll be able to wash your dirty clothes at those locations., Official Fitpacking trips regulate that participants carry their own food, as there are no restaurants or grocery stores in the backwoods.(Keep in mind when you’re packing clothing that you’ll need to leave room for the food.) Plan to bring foods that are high in proteins, as these will give your body the most energy during physical exertion. Also, bring fibrous foods (such as high-fiber energy bars) and portable fruits and vegetables, such as apples.


Outdoor supply stores will sell dehydrated food that is lightweight and takes up very little space in your pack. Avoid packing any food that contains liquid or heavy packaging (cans, for example), as these will add substantial weight., The Fitpacking site allows you to book a reservation on a fitpacking trip, and specifies the dates, location, and fee in advance.Outdoor-oriented retail stores such as REI will also put together fitpacking trips in their local area. If you have a few friends who are interested in trying fitpacking with you, bring them with and you can all sign up together.The REI website does not offer any fitpacking information or a signup page, so you’ll need to visit a brick and mortar store to find out what fitpacking opportunities they offer.

, Official Fitpacking excursions are conducted in many scenic places throughout the United States; most are located in well-known National Parks and Forests including the Grand Canyon, Los Padres National Forest, and Acadia National Park.Other organizations (such as REI) may book more Fitpacking trips in the backcountry.


Finally, if you have a group of friends that you’d like to try fitpacking with (at least 7–10 people), you can do your own research into an affordable destination and put together your own unofficial fitpacking-type backpacking trip.

, Since fitpacking excursions are booked months in advance, you’ll need to be mindful of the season during which you’ll be fitpacking. Summer trips are advisable for beginners, as you’ll be dealing with fewer extreme weather conditions, and travel fees (including plane tickets) will likely be cheaper.Avoid fitpacking in winter unless you already have substantial winter wilderness experience. Fitpacking trips last for one or two weeks (depending on the duration of the trip you booked), which can be a dangerous duration of time for a novice to spend in nature in the winter., Official Fitpacking trips are designed to encourage weight loss through hiking, avoiding sedentary activities, and spending time outdoors. That said, it’s important to not starve yourself while hiking; your body will need plenty of calories and protein to keep up energy levels and be able to perform physically. Your physical fitness will improve as you build muscle and shed fat.Don’t bring junk food with you; as tempting as it may be to sneak in a few candy bars for when you’re hungry, avoid this impulse. Instead, snack on an apple or a bag of beef jerky.

, Although you’ll be backpacking and camping with a group, it’s always good practice to let a family member or a friend know where you’ll be backpacking and how long you’ll be gone. This way, if they haven’t heard from you by the time you’re supposed to be back, the individual can notify authorities that the group may be lost or may have experienced a backwoods emergency.To be truly prepared, provide the family member or friend with a map of the area you’ll be backpacking in. If the route has been determined in advance, mark the path you’ll be taking onto the map.

, A common—and potentially serious—mistake among first-time backpackers is not thinking to bring sufficient water for the trip, and also neglecting to bring a water purification system. Water is a heavy substance to bring in your pack, so before you start buying bottled water, research the area you’ll be backpacking. If there are plenty of streams and lakes, you may only need a single water bottle and an efficient means of purifying stream water. However, if you’re trip takes you through dry areas, you’ll need to pack all the water in.


When bringing water with you, plan to have at least four liters of water for a day of hiking. While backpacking, water is commonly carried in a sturdy 1-liter bottle (such as a Nalgene), in a water bladder (like a Camelback) or in a large, collapsible plastic jug.If you’ll have access to water in nature, bring a water filter that will allow you to strain harmful bacteria out of the water. Alternately, purchase bacteria-killing tablets to dissolve in your water containers.
Both water-cleansing methods will be available at outdoor retail stores.

Get a pedometer.,
Try running up and down some stadium stairs.,
Try interval training.,
Do jumping jacks.,
Target your inner thighs and abdominals with scissor kicks.,
Dance along to music you like or join a dance class.,
Do an organized sport.,
Do lunges, if you want to build toned muscle.,
Understand that you can't just lose weight in one area of your body.",How to Get Thinner Thighs1," A pedometer is a counter that keeps track of how many steps you've taken each day. You can usually fit it on your hip, and nowadays, you can get pedometers that no one can even see, so there's no excuse not to get one.


Shoot to take between 5,000 and 10,000 steps each day.That may seem like a lot, but it's less than you think. (5,000 steps are a little more than 2 miles (3.2 km).) Find excuses to walk places. Take the stairs instead of the elevator or escalator. Walk to the grocery store instead of driving. Getting to 10,000 steps takes a little practice, but once you get there, it's worth it.;
, Motivate your inner Rocky and bust up and down those stairs. If you feel your muscles burning, it is a sign that they are getting a good work out. Also, try using the stairs instead of the elevator in a building!

, Interval training is when you exercise really hard for a short amount of time, followed by longer periods of light intensity training. For example, if you're running around a track, you could jog for three laps and then go as fast as you can for the last lap. It'll kick your butt, but that's kinda the point. Right?


Interval training has been scientifically shown to burn more calories and improve aerobic capacity.Start by replacing a couple of your regular workouts with interval training, ramping up from there. You'll see results faster if you stick with it.

, Instead of jumping jacks alone, which can be a little boring and not feel very effective, try doing jumping jacks after you're totally tuckered out from another workout. After you've run a mile, swum 20 laps, or biked your heart through your chest, get up and do 20 jumping jacks at full intensity. It's a nice way to really put your workout regimen over the top, and you'll feel it in your thighs.

, This is a great exercise that you can do practically anywhere, without needing any special equipment. Lay on your back with your hands underneath your glutes, raise your feet into the air, and start kicking back and forth with short controlled movements. Remember to point your toes out and move one leg back as you move the other forward. For a more intense workout, leave your hands out to the side instead of underneath your glutes.


To target the thighs specifically, extend the legs wide and quickly pull them back together. This is similar to a jumping jack movement while lying on your back.

, This is DIY fun, and it can be a really effective way to work out because you're having so much fun. A dance class has the added benefit of working you for a set amount of time, not just until you don't feel like it anymore.

, You may not be much of a ""sporty"" person, but there are hundreds of sports to suit all different kinds of people. So you don't like basketball; engage in tennis. You don't like tennis; engage in soccer. Competition can break up the monotony of a workout and make it into something really fun.


It's also possible to burn more calories during an organized or intramural sport than it is working out alone. If you're playing soccer for an hour, you're likely to burn around 730 calories. If you're doing Hatha yoga by yourself for an hour, you're likely to burn only about 200 calories. That's a big difference.

, With a dumbbell in either hand, lunge forward with one leg while simultaneously lowering the opposite knee until it's about an inch above the ground. Step back and continue with the opposite leg.


Bodyweight exercises like lunges are ideal if you want to avoid bulking up but still want to build healthy and lean muscle.

, The myth that you can just lose weight in your thighs, or in another part of your body, is called ""spot training.""In other words, you have to lose weight from all over in order to lose weight in your thighs.

Take in fewer calories than you burn during the day.,
Eat more food in the morning and afternoon than at night.,
Eat the right kinds of foods.,
Stay away from the wrong kinds of food.,
Drink lots of water.",How to Get Thinner Thighs2," Want to lose weight? This is the only reliable way to do it. Since one pound contains about 3,500 calories, you'll need to burn approximately 3,500 more calories than you eat as food in order to burn one pound of weight.


Don't get daunted by these numbers. 3,500 calories is a lot to lose in a single day. Shoot at first to lose around an extra 250 to 500 calories a day.
Get in the habit of counting the calories you eat. A lot of people don't know how many calories they consume until they actually start writing them down. Carefully measure your portion sizes, and make a list or a calorie counter journal to keep track of all the food you eat during a given day. Like a budget, this list will help guide and inform your weight loss program.

, Eating a balanced meal in the morning to start off the day is important. It gives your body the energy it needs to perform essential tasks. But eating a whole lot of food right before you go to sleep isn't good for you, not because your metabolism slows down, but because the types of foods you are likely to eat right before bed are often bad snack foods.Studies have shown that animals that eat exclusively during their ""right"" cycles — that is, when they are most active — do better at weight loss than animals that eat during their ""wrong"" cycles — the night for humans, or daytime for mice.Eat late, risk putting on weight.

, In order to get extra weight off your whole body generally, and your thighs specifically, it's essential to eat the right kinds of food. Scientists and doctors routinely recommend going with a combination of:


Lean protein: white poultry meat, soy and dairy products, fish, etc.
Vegetables and legumes: spinach, kale, broccoli, carrots, peas, lentils, beans, etc.
Fruits: citrus fruit, bananas, apples, kiwi, pears, etc.
Whole grains: whole grain pasta, whole grain bread, etc.
Nuts and seeds: pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, flax seeds, almonds, walnuts, etc.

, Overly processed foods, foods with the saturated or trans fats, and foods that fit into a high-glycemic diet are ones that doctors recommend staying away from. These foods include:


Refined sugars: candy, cakes, sugary drinks (sodas), etc.
Simple carbohydrates: normal pasta, white bread, etc.
Saturated and trans fats: butter, solid shortening, lard, margarine, etc.

, Drink water to keep your body hydrated, your organs happy, and to partially help trick your body into thinking that it's fuller than it is. If you're really hungry, drink an 8 oz. glass of water before you start your meal. You will feel fuller, and you won't end up eating as much. This is because people often confuse hunger and thirst signals from their body.

Reduce stress.,
Get plenty of sleep.,
Don't starve yourself for a quick fix.",How to Get Thinner Thighs3," When you are stressed, a hormone called cortisol is released. Cortisol can increase your blood sugar and cause you to gain more weight. If you have an extremely busy lifestyle, you might try to find ways to cut out stressors from your daily life.

""Mindful"" exercise such as Tai Chi or yoga can help release stress while letting you exercise at the same time., Aim for seven or eight hours of sleep a night. The amount of sleep that you get can affect how much hunger hormones are released into your body. Getting less than six or more than nine hours a night can cause you to eat more., Starving yourself actually has a negative effect on weight loss, funny enough. When you deprive your body of essential energy, it believes that it needs to start saving up energy to prepare for a period where it might not be getting as much food. In other words, your body prepares for hibernation. Instead of losing fat, you're likely to lose muscle and other lean tissue. That's not a good recipe for real weight loss.

Keep the fat off.",How to Get Rid of Flabby Arms," In order to get the most out of your work-outs and maximize muscle tone, it is important to set up a routine and stick to it. Choose 3 to 4 different exercises that you feel comfortable with and can perform correctly. You should also make sure to choose a selection of exercises that target different arm muscles, so as not to be working the same muscles all the time.


To begin with, you should aim to perform 3-4 sets of each exercise, with 8-12 repetitions each. You can increase both the number of sets and the number of repetitions as you begin to build tone and muscle in your arms.
Be aware that how you exercise will differ depending on whether you want to bulk up with added muscle or simply tone your arms without adding too much muscle mass. To simply tone up without bulking up - an option many women go for - you should use lighter weights with more repetitions. To increase muscle mass, you should aim to do fewer repetitions using increasingly heavier weights.;
, The push up is a pretty basic exercise, and one that most people have attempted at some point in their lives. It's an exercise that has stuck around for a reason - it works. Push ups target the tricep muscle in your arm, although they also strengthen your pectorals, abdominals, quads and lower back, making it a great overall exercise. To perform a basic push-up:









Lie face-down on a solid floor, keep your legs together and prop your feet up on your toes and the balls of your feet.
Place your hands palms-down on the floor, approximately a shoulder width apart.
Raise yourself up, using just the strength in your arms, until both arms are fully extended. Your body should be in a straight line from your head to your heels. This is the start and end position for the push up.
Slowly lower your body to the ground until your elbows form a 90-degree angle. Inhale as go down.
Slowly raise yourself back up into the extended arm position, exhaling as you do. You have now completed one repetition.

Variations: You can vary the basic push up exercise in a number of ways. If you're just starting to build up strength in your arms, you can make the exercise slightly easier by keeping your knees on the ground throughout the exercise. You can also try a triangle push up, where your hands form a triangle with your forefingers and thumbs, directly below the breastbone.

, Bench dips are another common exercise that help develop the triceps, while also working the pectorals and major shoulder muscles.All you need to perform this exercise is an exercise bench or step, though a kitchen chair will also work just fine. To perform a basic bench dip:









Sit up straight on the edge of the bench or chair, extending your legs in front of you and planting your feet firmly on the ground.
Firmly grip the edge of the bench or chair, with your fingers facing downwards. Slowly slide your body off the bench, without moving your legs.
Slowly lower your body towards the floor, keeping your back straight, until your arms form a 90-degree angle.
Straighten the arms again, and push your body back to the original starting position. You have now completed one repetition.

Variations: To increase the difficulty of the bench dip, try propping your feet up on a second exercise bench or chair.

, Bicep curls are one of the most basic weightlifting exercises, which help you to build arm strength and look good in short sleeves. Bicep curls target the two bicep muscles which control the flexing of your elbow.To do bicep curls, you will need a set of dumbbells, that weigh between 5 and 15 pounds each.









Hold a dumbbell in each hand and stand up straight with your feet hip-width apart.
Let your arms hang relaxed at your side, with your palms facing forward.
With your elbows held at your hip bones, slowly raise both weights until your forearms almost touch your chest.
Slowly lower the weights back into the starting position, maintaining tension in your biceps. Make an effort to maintain good posture at all times, with your back straight and stomach pulled in.

Variations: If you are performing this exercise at your local gym, look for an arm-curl machine which will target the exact same muscles as the dumbbells.If you're doing the exercises at home for the first time, you can also use a standard 15 oz can of beans or peas to perform this exercise.

, Pull ups are a very challenging exercise that target a whole range of muscles groups, including muscles in the back, chest, shoulders and abdominals, as well as the biceps and lower arms. To perform a pull up you will need an exercise bar, and if you're new to pull-ups, an assisted band.


Grasp the overhead bar with your palms facing forward and your hands a little wider than your shoulders. Let your body hang.
Pull your body up towards the bar, until your chin is slightly above it. Hold for one to two seconds, if you can.
Lower yourself down again but avoid extending your arms completely as this will keep your muscles engaged. You have now completed one repetition.

Variations: Pull-ups are quite a complex exercise, but with practice they can be successfully completed regardless of age or gender. To help you get started, you can use an assisted band which is attached to the overhead bar. You then slip your foot into the bottom of the band, which helps by taking some of your body weight.

, The bench press is an exercise designed to increase upper body strength, and targets the chest and shoulder muscles, in addition to the triceps.To perform the bench press, you will need a barbell and an exercise bench.









Place the barbell on the bench rack and add your chosen weights. The weight should be challenging, but light enough that you can do about 8 repetitions without resting. For beginners, the bar itself (with no additional weight) may be challenging enough.Lie down flat on the exercise bench in a natural position, with your feet on the floor and your shoulders touching the bench.
Reach up and grasp the bar with an overhand grip, with your hands spaced about a shoulder-width apart. Some body-builders prefer a wider grip, but keeping your hands a shoulder-width apart places more emphasis on the triceps.
Engage your abdominal muscles and slowly lift the bar off the rack. Position the bar directly above the middle of your chest and extend your arms.
Slowly lower the bar down to your chest, bending your elbows out to the sides. Inhale as you lower the bar.
Press the bar back up to the starting position, while exhaling. You have now completed one repetition.

Note: With this exercise, it may be necessary to have another person present to act as a ""spotter"", particularly if you are working with very heavy weights. The spotter will help you lift the weight into position, return it to the rack afterwards and generally keep on eye on things to ensure you don't drop a heavy bar on yourself.

, This is a great exercise for building overall upper body strength. Although it doesn't target the arms specifically, it will help build the necessary strength to do other arm-specific exercises. It is also fantastic for the oblique muscles along your side.To perform the side plank reverse fly:


Lie down on your side on the floor and prop yourself up with either your hand or elbow. The elbow is an easier option for beginners.
Stack your feet one on top of the other and lift your hips off the floor so that your body forms a diagonal line.
With your free hand, grab a dumbbell and extend your arm straight up, keeping it in line with your shoulder.
Slowly lower the dumbbell in front of you, until your arm is perpendicular to your body.
Slowly raise the dumbbell back up, forming a ""T"" shape with your arm and the dumbbell. You have now completed one repetition.

Variations: Instead of stopping when the dumbbell is perpendicular with your body, you can keep going, rotating your body and twisting the dumbbell underneath, before returning to the starting position.

, The shoulder press is a great exercise to incorporate into your arm-toning routine. While it is primarily used for strengthening the shoulders, it also engages both the biceps and the triceps, making it a good overall arm work-out.To do a shoulder press:









Start from a seated or standing position with a dumbbell in each hand and your back straight.
Lift the weights so they are at shoulder-level. Your elbows should be lower than your wrists and your palms facing away from your body.
Slowly straighten your arms, lifting the dumbbells above your head. Try not to lock your elbows.
Hold the dumbbells above your head for a second or two, then slowly lower them back to the starting position. You have now completed one repetition.

Variations: You can also perform this exercise using a barbell or on a weight machine specifically designed for shoulder presses. This exercise is also easily combined with the bicep curl and triceps French press.

, Fast, repetitive punches are a great way to shape your arms. This exercise will work your shoulders and build strength. You can punch without any equipment, although you may use weights or a punching bag as well.


Stand straight. Your legs should be hip-width apart with your knees slightly bent.
Bend your arms 90-degrees at the elbow, and hold them up in front of your face.
Punch your right arm forward until your arm is straight. Your palm should face the floor.
Bend the right arm back to starting position, and repeat with the left arm.

Variations: Hold a dumbbell in either hand, or use a punching bag.

, Arm circles are a great, easy exercise that can be performed anytime, anywhere, making them a great exercise option for beginners. Arm circles help to tone both your biceps and triceps, while also strengthening the back and shoulders.To do arm circles:









Stand with your feet about a shoulder-width apart and extend your arms straight out to the sides, so they're in line with your shoulders.
Begin rotating your arms forward in small, circular motions, without moving your wrists or elbows.
After about 20 circles, change direction and begin rotating your arms backwards.

Variations: To increase the intensity of the arm circles, you can rotate your arms faster or use hand weights that are light enough to allow you to do 8-10 rotations.

, It is important to understand that it is not possible to target weight loss on a specific area of your body, such as your arms. If you lose weight, you may lose it off your waist or tummy before you see any difference in your arms. However, if you maintain a healthy diet and a well-structured exercise routine, you will certainly begin to see results all over your body - sooner rather than later.Understand that it is not enough to just do arm toning and muscle building exercises. Yes, you will improve muscle tone, but if the muscle is covered in a layer of fat the outward appearance of your arms will not change all that much. Once you shed the extra layer of fat, however, the fabulously firm muscles underneath will be revealed.Equally, it is not enough to just lose weight either. As mentioned above, there is no way to specifically target arm fat, so it may be a while before a healthy diet and aerobic exercise noticeably impacts the size of your arms. Even if your arms do become thinner, they can still look flabby if you have no muscle tone beneath the fat.
This is why balancing specific arm toning exercises with overall weight loss is the key to getting rid of flabby arms. It's all about balance.

, People sometimes want to lose arm fat for cosmetic reasons, but flabby arms are often a sign of being overweight in general. The action you should take depends on your current health, and how much weight you stand to lose.


Check your BMI. To get a quick handle on your health as it pertains to weight, you can perform a body mass index (BMI) test. Taking the test at the site provided will return a number that depicts your level of body fat.
In general, a BMI score between 19 and 26 is healthy. A BMI score above 26 signifies the need to lose weight, and a BMI score over 30 indicates more serious obesity.Decide whether or not to talk to a doctor. If your BMI index number is above 30, you may want to consider talking to a doctor about how to proceed. If you are healthy and simply carry fat in your arms, simple dietary changes and exercise will likely do the trick.

, There are many diet options and techniques out there, but they all have the same basic ground rules - you need to reduce your calorie intake and aim to eat healthier foods. The following are tips on how to eat if you want to lose fat from all over your body, including your arms.


Avoid fatty or greasy foods. Ingesting fatty or greasy foods like fried food, cheese, and hamburgers is just asking to gain weight.
It may not be necessary to significantly reduce your portion sizes to lose weight. Instead try to switch to lean meats like chicken or turkey, and eat lots of fruit and vegetables. That said, if you have a healthy diet already, decreasing your portions may help.
Always eat breakfast. Research shows that people who eat breakfast - especially filling, protein-rich breakfasts - lose more weight and find it easier to keep it off. Drink plenty of water. Drinking at least 8 glasses of water each day will support metabolism, help you feel less hungry, and burn fat.
Avoid sports nutrition bars. These products may give you energy, but they often include fattening ingredients.

, Exercising is one of the best ways to burn fat - not just in the arms but all over the body. It is very important that you incorporate a substantial amount of aerobic exercise into your workout routine.


You can do as many muscle building and toning exercises for your arms as you like, but unless you burn off the fat covering your muscles, your arms will continue to look flabby.
Running, swimming, dancing or even walking are all effective forms of aerobic exercise, and will burn fat from all over your body, including your arms.
Healthy adults should aim to do 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise a week, or 75 minutes of intense exercise., If you take the above advice and see results, congratulations! But know that in order to keep the fat off, you must maintain a healthy lifestyle. This means continuing to eat healthy.


Lean proteins, high-fiber carbs, and a wide variety of vegetables are the best bet. Try to stick to three good meals each day, with limited snacking.
Keep exercising. One great way to ensure continued health is by committing to an established routine. Get yourself a gym membership or set aside some time a few days each week to get your exercises done.
If you keep up with your diet and exercise, you will remain healthy, and will most likely see additional benefits such as loss of other body fat, higher energy levels, and improvements in mood.

They can help you develop a workout plan that lets you make the most of your weekly gym time by practicing functional exercises that mimic daily activities.You may have to experiment to find the right weight for you. Remember that good form is critical to building strength and keeping yourself safe, so it's better to start light and develop your form than to go too heavy to fast.
Increase the weight every few weeks as you build strength and your muscles become used to the load.;
, While once-weekly workouts can help build muscle strength, once a week really isn't sufficient for cardio exercise.You don't necessarily need to go to the gym to get a healthy amount of cardio into your day. A 10- to 15-minute walk in the morning or evening is sufficient.
You also can add cardio into your regular day, for example by taking the stairs instead of the elevator, or by parking further away from your destination.

, If your aim is significant strength gains, or if you're trying to build muscle endurance for other activities, you may benefit more from working out twice a week than only once.Researchers differ on whether twice weekly sessions are better, but evidence has shown that athletes who did strength training twice a week rather than once a week added more than twice as much lean muscle than those who worked out only once a week.
Twice-weekly workouts also are less shocking to your muscles and your body, allowing you to adapt and build muscle more quickly.

, If you're only working out once a week, you need to choose weight-lifting exercises that engage multiple muscle groups, such as dead lifts, squats, and military presses. Compound lifts work both major and minor muscle groups.Doing compound lifts also means that you can do fewer exercises, which will make your once-weekly workout shorter than if you were doing exercises that isolated or targeted only a single muscle group.
Keep your resistance low to moderate to help avoid injury.

, When you're choosing the exercises to include in a once-weekly workout, include exercises that engage both the pushing and pulling muscles, the positive and negative movements.Uneven muscle development can put you at risk for injury. You'll get the most out of your workout if you evenly build the counterpart to each muscle group. For example, if you do a biceps exercise, you should also do a triceps exercise.

, While weight training can quickly build muscle mass, bodyweight exercises also are important for strength training, particularly in once-weekly workouts.The other benefit of bodyweight exercises is that you can do them anywhere, without needing a gym or any bulky equipment.
For this reason, a full bodyweight exercise routine is ideal if you're traveling and need to workout away from home.
Just 15 to 20 minutes of basic squats, push-ups, planks, and lunges can be of maximum benefit once a week.

, Planks are essential to build and strengthen your core. In a once-weekly workout, you can build a dynamic series with a breath for each movement to increase the intensity of the basic plank.Start the series in a full plank with your feet about hip-width apart and your wrists directly under your shoulders. On an exhale, lower your hips to the floor, rolling onto the tops of your feet.
On an inhale, lift and open your chest, bending your back deeply and raising your hips off the floor.
As you exhale, roll onto your toes and lift your hips to the ceiling so that you are in an upside-down V-shape. Drop to a plank on your next inhale. Repeat the series 5 to 10 times.

, Before you engage in high-intensity exercise, warming up your muscles and getting your heart rate up is essential. A dynamic warm-up will get your blood pumping and get your muscles ready for more intense exercise.You can exercise by jogging in place and doing some quick lunges. You also want to include some upper-body movement, such as circling your arms backwards and forwards.
Move fairly quickly, and include a warm-up of five minutes or more before you get into your workout.

, When designing a once-weekly workout routine, you'll get more benefit in the shortest amount of time if you line up your exercises so that you are working opposing muscle groups sequentially. Alternatively, you may get even greater benefit and more functional muscle memory from combining upper and lower body exercises.For example, you would follow an upper-body exercise with a lower-body exercise. This allows your upper body to recover while you work out your lower body, enabling you to take fewer rest breaks in between exercises.
Because you don't allow your muscles to recover fully by taking extended rest periods, you keep your heart rate elevated, naturally upping the intensity of your workout.

, Plyometric exercises are jumping exercises such as jumping jacks, mountain climbers, or burpees. These exercises build explosive power in your muscles and also give you a whole-body workout.Plyometric exercises also engage your cardiovascular system, keeping your heart rate elevated and upping the intensity of your workout.

, Stretching is essential to increase flexibility, but you should stretch warm muscles. Dynamic stretching for two to three minutes at the end of your workout is sufficient and will allow your heart rate to slow and your core temperature to lower after high-intensity exercise.Start with an overhead stretch, then fold forward into a full forward bend. You also might add quad and glute stretches. Hold each stretch for 30 seconds, and don't bounce or pulse the stretch.
Lunges also are good stretches for the quads.

Use household items for gym equipment.",How to Have a Green Workout," Skipping the drive to the gym is a good way to make your workout environmentally friendly and get some more exercise in the process. Leave your car at home and head outside for a walk or run.If you can, consider ditching your gym workout (at least a few days a week) in favor of outdoor cardio activities.
Without needing to drive anywhere, even if it is a short distance, you will be saving the fuel you would use to drive and reducing the amount of fumes released from your car.
Try going for a walk or run around your neighborhood or local park. You can head out before your go to work, or go for a quick jog when you get home.
If you feel uncomfortable walking or running alone or going when it's dark, consider taking a friend or family member with you.;
, Similar to walking or running, another great idea to reduce your environmental footprint is by staying home and doing an exercise DVD or other home-based workout.


Again, if you can skip the gym you won't have to drive to the gym and waste gas and fuel.
Using an exercise DVD, video or doing a workout at home is a great alternative. It's also a good way to work out if it's raining, too cold or hot, or if you don’t have a safe place to work out outside.
Purchase a few exercise DVDs, look for online exercise videos or make up your own exercise routine to do at home.

, Another way to help the environment is to make your commute to work your workout for the day. Skip driving or taking the train and walk, bike or run to work.Skipping the gym in favor of a home workout is a great start to having a more green and environmentally friendly exercise routine. However, if you get right back in the car to head to work, you're still using excess gas and fuel.
If you can, try making your usual work commute your exercise for the day. Try walking, biking or evening running to work if you're able.
This will not only cut down on the gas spent going to the gym, but also cut down on the gas used to get you to work.
If you don't want to run, walk or bike to work daily, just pick a few days out of the week. Or if you work too far away, consider walking or biking to the grocery store, pharmacy or other local places.

, If you enjoy playing sports - like soccer or basketball - you may want to consider doing a team sport. Playing a team sport does not consume as much energy as using an exercise machine, and it is also a great social way to stay active.One of the best aspects about team sports, is the use of shared equipment. You probably won't have to go out and buy brand new gear. Much of the gear is shared between the whole team.
If you can, consider carpooling to practices and games. This way, you don't have 10 cars on the road, you'll only have one or two instead. This cuts down on the gas use.
In addition, team sports are a great way to stay accountable. You can't skip practices or games often, otherwise you'd be letting the team down.

, A very easy way to make your workout greener, is by using a reusable water bottle. Since over 50 billion plastic water bottles are used yearly, much of that excess plastic ends up in landfills.If you typically grab a bottle of water or a sports drink when you work out, consider ditching those plastic bottles in favor of a reusable bottle.
Many reusable bottles are made out of stainless steel or BPA-free plastic. They come in a variety of sizes to fit your needs.
Make sure to fill up your water bottle before you hit the gym or before you work out at home. That way, you'll have ice cold water ready to go when you need it.

, Many types of exercises require the use of either a yoga or fitness mat. To keep your workout green, look to purchase a mat that's eco-friendly and green.


More traditional yoga mats, those that aren't considered eco-friendly, are typically made with PVC plastic which could contain heavy metals and phthalates.Instead, consider purchasing an all-natural rubber yoga mat. These are made from an all-natural source - the rubber tree - and it's considered a renewable resource and it's biodegradable.
You can also consider purchasing a plant fiber mat, such as Barefoot Yoga’s Natural Jute and Per Eco Friendly Yoga Mat.These mats are made from either jute, hemp, cotton or a combination and are also considered renewable and biodegradable.

, Another important aspect to consider is your exercise clothing. Not all clothing is considered green, so be careful with what you buy and try choose more sustainable clothing companies.Many brands of exercise clothing are very specialized. They're designed to wick sweat away from your body, be more breathable or be more durable.
You can also try to find clothing that is made from eco-friendly fabric, such as bamboo, organic cotton, hemp, or recycled polyester.Check the labels on the clothing you buy to check for these eco-friendly materials.
Review different companies websites and manufacturing processes so you feel comfortable with what you're buying.

, Similar to specific clothing and fitness mats, try to choose an environmentally friendly pair of shoes. There are a host of options to fit your athletic needs.


Look for shoes that are made from organic cotton or upcycled materials, such as brands like the People’s Movement, Veja, and Bourgeois Bohème.If you really want to get a pair of super eco-friendly shoes, consider purchasing a pair of barefoot running shoes. These minimalist shoes only use a little material so they're naturally more eco-friendly.
You can also donate your old sneakers when you are ready for a new pair. There are organizations that will give gently used shoes to people in need, grind up well-worn shoes into playground material, or even remake old shoes into a new pair of shoes.Check out organizations such as Soles4Souls, Nike Reuse-a-Shoe, Share Your Soles, Shoes4Africa, and Give Your Sole., If you do go to the gym, there are still ways to be a little more environmentally friendly. Start with those towels you pick up.


Most gyms offer their clients free hand towels to use during their workouts. Instead of grabbing two or more towels, just grab one.
Remember, the gym needs to wash and clean all of these towels. If everyone is grabbing two or more towels, they'll need to spend more water and energy to clean all of those towels.
Try to stick to only one towel per day or per gym trip instead of multiple towels. Or, consider bringing your own towel instead.

, Did you know you can actually harness all that energy you spend on fitness equipment at home? Consider using that energy to help power up your home.If you want to get a little crafty at home, you can actually attach a generator or battery to some common cardio machines - like a stationary bike.
As you bike, the energy generated by the bike will get saved into the battery. You can then use this energy later to power up simple household appliances.
You can use this energy to power up: an iPod, computer, the toaster or even a TV.
Some gyms have machines that generate energy while you use them.Look for a gym that offers these types of machines or ask the manager at your gym if this is something they might consider.

, If you have gym equipment at home or are using equipment at the gym, there are still ways to save energy and make your workout green.


For example, instead of watching the TV while you run or use the elliptical at the gym, keep the TV turned off to minimize how much energy you use. Also, turn off the TVs on treadmills or ellipticals that aren't being used.
Setting your treadmill to a higher incline level also helps cut down on the energy needed to power the machine.
Also, if you do happen to grab a bottle of water or a sports drink, make sure to avoid throwing it away in the regular trash. Recycle all plastic bottles you use.

, If you want to spend more time at home working out so you can save gas and energy, consider using some household items for your workouts.


Purchasing brand new gym equipment so you can workout at home can be expensive. Instead, try using some common household items that you can use for your workouts.
For example, you can use canned soup or gallon water jugs for weights. Instead of buying a new yoga mat, consider doing floor exercises on carpet. You can even use a crate or chair to help increase your elevation for certain exercises.

Overall, try to eat a balanced diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables and whole grains. Consume moderate amounts of proteins (like meat, fish, eggs, and beans) and milk products, and keep high-fat and sugary foods to a minimum.Don't obsess over caloric intake - just try to eat fresh foods instead of processed ones to feel light and energetic throughout the day.;
, It's important to create a routine so you don't skip out. Try to incorporate your exercise regime as a habit (i.e. every morning after you brush your teeth).


Many people find a bit of free time in the morning is best; you'll also be energized for the rest of the day.

, An environment in which you are comfortable and can move about freely should do the trick. Avoid places with a lot of distractions.


If your surroundings permit, consider expanding your workout space beyond the home. The yard, streets and/or parks in your neighborhood are all potential places to get fit. Plus, a little change in the environment can really help break the monotony of any workout.

, Think of what parts of the body you want to get stronger, and which ones you want to stretch.

, Have a notebook on hand and write down your workout. This will help you keep track of things and make sure you do the proper amount.

, While it's possible to get fit without any special equipment at all, having some basics will help things go smoothly.


Clothes: Wear soft, comfortable clothing. You don't need anything fancy, just what feels good and allows you a full range of movement. Don't forget supportive footwear for walks, jogs, and aerobic exercises.
Equipment: If you have the space and budget, you can opt for a treadmill, stationary bicycle, or elliptical machine. If not, look for a few basics like hand weights, a jump rope, and a yoga mat.

, Whether it's losing a certain amount of weight or training for a marathon, having a goal helps keep you motivated. Be realistic, however: any fitness plan needs to be gradual.


Remember: slow and steady wins the race. Don't push yourself too far, but stick to your plan. It's better to exercise a little bit each day than a lot once.

, Warming up increases the blood flow to your muscles, improving mobility and reducing the risk of injury.A light walk or cycle will do.

, As opposed to static stretching, where you hold a stretch for several seconds, dynamic stretching is done through slow, controlled movements. Studies suggest dynamic movement is best to do after your warm-up and before the main part of your workout. Aim for several repetitions of 30 seconds each.


Lift your knees high or kick them out straight in front as you walk. For a spine stretch, twist your upper body in the direction of the leg (i.e., right leg up, twist to the right).For neck motility, lift and lower your chin, then lower your left ear to your left shoulder and right ear to right shoulder.
Swing your arms up over your shoulders and then down and back, then swing them out to the side and crossing in front of your chest.
Do circles with your hips clockwise and counterclockwise.
Stretch to the side slowly in a standing position., This is also known as the aerobic part of your workout, during which your heart rate should increase. Beginners should try for 30 minutes of cardiovascular workout for a minimum of three times a week.You can increase the intensity of your warm-up activity: walk, cycle or jog faster.
Do a short aerobics video.
Jump rope., These exercises build strength. Aim to do resistance exercises 20 to 30 minutes three times a week; a good goal is to do three sets of 10-15 repetitions of each exercise. Try to include strengthening for all the muscle groups. There are hundreds of exercises out there, but here are a few to get you started.For upper body, try push-ups, overhead dumbbell press, and many other dumbbell exercises.
For abdominals and core, you can do planks or sit-ups. It's important to always keep your lower back rounded (not arched) while doing abdominal exercises, so you target the right muscles and avoid hurting your back.
Build lower-body strength with squats and lunges.Work your hip and back muscles with hip bridges. Lie on your back with your feet flat on the ground, hip-width apart. Squeeze your buttocks and lift your hips up so that there is a straight line between the knees and shoulders. Hold for 2 seconds, slowly lower, and repeat., Now's the moment for static stretching. Try to do at least three 15-minute sessions per week. Stretching is a great stress reliever. Remember, though: breathe, don't bounce, as you hold a stretch. Try to hold positions for 30 seconds. Stretching should never hurt! Go gently.


Hamstring stretch: Sit on the floor with your legs out in front of you, feet up. Reach forward toward your toes and hold.
Calf stretch: Stand and extend one leg behind you with the foot on the floor. Bend the front leg slowly, keeping the hips and shoulders square. Repeat with the other leg.Quadriceps stretch: Stand on one leg and grasp the ankle of the other. Pull your heel up and in towards your buttocks. Keep your knees close together.Hip flexor stretch: Kneel on your right knee and put your left leg out in front, knee bent. Put your right hand on your right hip and shift your weight onto your left leg, leaning forward but keeping your back straight.Shoulder stretch: Bring your left arm across your body and hold it with your right arm, above or below the elbow., Your cool-down segment should be similar to the warm-up - a short, easy walk, jog or cycle that lowers the heart rate.

, If you find yourself with very little time on your hands, try working out as you do your chores. Focus on calorie-burning activities like raking leaves, mopping, scrubbing the tub or vacuuming.


Listen to some upbeat music and do squats, push-ups or jumping jacks every time a new song starts.

, Two or three 10-minute walks around the neighborhood per day adds up!

, Gardening is good exercise, and if you grow some vegetables, you have healthy food for free!

, If you live in an apartment building, climb up and down a few flights every day - even if you live on the first floor. Stair climbing is a great strength-building aerobic exercise.

, Keep a small weight near your phone so you can pump your arms as you talk."

Take supplement.",How to Get Fit Fast," Try to do exercises which work multiple muscle groups at once and provide superior results for the amount of time which you need to put in to doing them, as exercises like these are more efficient. Such exercises are usually very tiring and hard on the body, but they will get you the furthest the fastest.;
, Planks are one of the most efficient exercises.You can greatly improve your core, leg, and arm strength with just a few minutes of this exercise every day. Planks are done by holding a position similar to a push up, but supporting the upper half of your body on your forearms. Hold this for as long as possible. Do 5-10 minutes of this a day, broken into sets, for visible results.

, Burpees are done by starting in a standing position. Drop to a crouch, go into a push-up form, go back to the crouch position, and then jump upwards with hands raised to return to the standing position. These are considered a very effective exercise, as they work all areas of the body.

, Step forward with your right leg, and lower your body until both legs are bent at 90-degree angles. Keep your back straight, and do not let your front knee bend over your toes. Push back up to starting position, and repeat with the left leg.

You can easily add weight to this move by doing bicep curls with dumbbells.

, Squats are done by standing with your feet a hip's distance apart, your back straight, arms crossed in front of you, and slowly lowering yourself down as if to sit in a chair. After you are in the sitting position, raise yourself back up. These are a great exercise for your core and leg muscles. You can add hand-held weights to the routine to work the arms as well.


To work out your lower and upper body at the same time, try adding an overhead press to your squat. Hold dumbbells in each hand at hip or shoulder level. Squat down, and as you rise up out of the squat, press the dumbbells overhead.

, Push-ups are a great exercise that will work out your triceps, shoulders, glutes, and core. To start, get into a plank pose with your hands flat on the ground below your shoulders. Lower your body until you are just above the ground. As you do so, tuck your elbows close to your body, keeping your core engaged. Push back up, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions., Most experts will agree that walking is probably one of the best ways to get fit. If you are completely out of shape, you can just walk. If you are decently in shape, you can walk quickly. For those that are further along, you can hike, jog or run. Walking is a great way to work many muscle groups and improve heart strength and blood flow.

, Interval training is any exercise repeated at a very high intensity for only a few minutes (2-3 at most) and alternated with a slow paced activity or rest. Continue high intensity and low intensity intervals for about twenty minutes. Interval training is regarded as one of the most effective exercise regimens. It is less time consuming but appears to produce identical effects., The most basic interval training routine is to run as fast as you can for 2-3 blocks (or roughly 400 meters) and then walk back to the starting point, beginning the process over again.


Alternatively, warm up by walking slowly for five minutes and quickly for ten minutes. You can then sprint for three blocks, walk back two blocks, sprint for three blocks, walk back two blocks (and so on, lasting 15 minutes). When that time has passed, walk back quickly to your origin point to cool down.

, You can apply interval training to almost any exercise activity, as long as it has the potential to be very intense. You can try cycling, swimming, as well as many core exercises. Alternate between exercise activities on different days if you can to ensure that all of your muscle groups get worked evenly.

, You can exercise all you want but if you live off of McDonald’s cheeseburgers, you’re going to have an awfully difficult time getting fit. It’s important to eat a balanced diet so that your body gets all of the essential fuel it needs to run. Eat a balance of lean meats, legumes, fruits, vegetables, and carbohydrates to get your body what it needs.


You will want to be sure to get lots of lean protein, as this is necessary for building muscle. Good sources of protein include seafood, lean meats, eggs, milk, beans, soy and nuts.
Carbohydrates from whole grains, vegetables, fruit, and dairy will provide you with energy.
Avoid foods with a high amount of trans fats. This typically includes processed foods, microwavable meals, pastries, and fried foods.

, Your body is made mostly of water, so you better believe you need it! Try to drink straight water, or water flavored with a little natural lemon juice or other natural flavoring. Drinking soda will add way too much sugar to your diet (fake sugar is not good for you either), as will juice. Tea and coffee dehydrate your body and should also be avoided.


Milk is actually a great and inexpensive source of both calcium and protein.
It is recommended that adults drink eight 8oz glasses of water every day. This number will be different for everybody, so pay attention to what your body needs, but 8 is an excellent starting point. Don’t forget that this number can be split between different types of liquid.
Do not wait until you are thirsty to drink water. If you feel thirsty, you are probably already dehydrated. Furthermore, being thirsty can sometimes cause you to overeat.

, While science still has a lot of unknowns regarding the benefits of vitamins, they generally are understood to probably be helpful (so long as you take the right ones in the right amounts). Consult with your doctor, a nutritionist, or a registered dietitian about the supplements that they would recommend.


Vitamins can be dangerous too. Certain combinations can make you sick or complicate any existing health conditions. You can also overdose on many vitamins. Treat them like medicine and talk to your doctor before starting any supplement regimen.

, You can also rest your legs up on the seat of a chair. If you have hurt your upper back or neck, find a pillow that supports the curve of your neck.

, Cover the ice pack with a towel to avoid ice burns.

, Doctors do not prescribe bed rest for more than 24 to 76 hours.

, Breathe in through the nose for 7 seconds, hold the breath in for 4 seconds and breathe out through the mouth for 8 seconds. This can reduce anxiety and muscle tension in the back.

,, It's good to pick one that has a lot of dandelions to start with, so you can get a good idea of what the finished product will look like, quicker.

, You will be moving your legs back and forth looking for new dandelions to kill and this is part of the exercising.

, You may need to move it around until you find the root that you are trying to cut in half.

, If it resists, take the tool to it again, until you find the root that needs to be cut.

, Turn from left to right, alternating your hands while using the tool.

, Stretching is very good for you.

,, Once you have done that, grab a handful of dandelions and see what comes up. If nothing does, do it some more. Once you have cleared away the main ones, the others will be easier to get out. Tugging on the dandelions is also a good strength and arm builder.

Eating fresh produce can help you stay fit and healthy.Make sure you have at least five servings of fruits and vegetables a day, scattered throughout your meals. This may mean that you have one to two servings of fruits and vegetables at breakfast, a serving of fruit and/or veggies at lunch, another serving as a snack, and a final serving at dinner. One serving of fruits could be an apple or a banana. One serving of vegetables could be 1/2 cup of raw, chopped vegetables or 1 cup of leafy green vegetables like spinach or kale.;
, Grains and proteins help give you enough energy to stay upbeat and have energy through your day. Having healthy grains, which do not include very much fat, starch, or sugar, will help your metabolism stay healthy and keep your immune system strong.Go for healthy grains like brown rice or quinoa instead of pasta and white rice. Opt for lean sources of protein like baked chicken or baked fish, rather than lots of red meat and salty lunch meats.

, To kickstart your healthy eating, you should sit down with your parents or guardians and make a meal plan. Collaborate with them to choose healthy meals that cover the five major food groups, as eating a variety of foods will ensure you maintain a healthy diet.Look up healthy recipes online and choose four to five of them to prepare for the week. Write out the ingredients for the recipes and make a shopping list so when you go with your parents to the grocery store, you know exactly what you are getting.
Sticking to a meal plan will also ensure you do not buy junk food or unhealthy food on a whim. Even if your parents do not want to do a meal plan with you, you can make your own meal plan and ask them if you can buy your own groceries when you all go to the supermarket.

, Get involved in meal making and preparing food, as this will allow you to choose healthy ingredients and know exactly what is in your food. Offer to do small things in the kitchen to help out your parents while they cook. They will likely appreciate the help and this way you have direct contact with your food before you eat it.


You may not feel comfortable using a knife, and your parents may not want you to use one either. Think of other things you can do to help out in the kitchen and get involved, like peeling vegetables or washing and cleaning fruit. You could also do the dishes or keep the counter clean for your parents while they cook.

, Maybe you have a weakness for chips and candy or you can’t get enough of cookies and cake. You may need to get rid of junk food in your home or ask your parents to keep junk food somewhere you cannot get to. This way, you are less tempted to snack on junk food when you are at home.


Try to replace junk food with healthy alternatives, like unbuttered popcorn, nuts, or sliced fruits and vegetables. Dark chocolate, in moderation, can also be a good alternative to sugary treats.

, Your school cafeteria likely offers you a carton of milk at lunch and drinking milk as a kid can help to build strong bones and give your body much needed minerals. Try to drink water when you are thirsty to stay hydrated and make sure you are having around two cups of milk a day to keep your calcium levels up.You can also have other sources of dairy, like a slice of cheddar cheese or a small container of yogurt. Having dairy in your diet will keep you healthy, especially as you grow.
It’s fine to have juice occasionally, but make sure it is 100% juice. Avoid sugary drinks like sodas and fruit punches as they contain a lot of sugar, which will translate to lots of calories.

, To maintain a healthy diet at school, try to plan out your meals at home so you have leftovers to bring to school as lunch. Pack your lunch the night before school or help your parents do this. Make sure your lunch will be filling but also nutritious, with enough fruits, vegetables, and healthy sources of protein, as well as dairy options.Sometimes having a cool lunch box can be a good motivator to bringing lunch to school everyday. If you do not already have a lunch box, you may want to ask your parents if you can go shopping for one together. You can then bring your lunch to school with you with pride.

, If you do not have the time or means to pack your lunches for school, you should try to always choose the healthier lunch options offered by your school cafeteria.Most school cafeterias will offer vegetable options, like leafy green vegetables, as well as sliced fruit or fruit cups. There may also be beans and peas as a vegetarian option, which could be a good choice if you are trying to maintain a healthy diet.
Avoid the quick, easy meals that are full of fat, sugar, and salt. Look for options that have been baked or broiled, with no added salt, as well as fresh options, if available.

, To satisfy any food cravings you may have at the midpoint of the day or after school on your way home, you should pack healthy snacks so they are easy to access. Keep a few bags of nuts or dried fruit in your locker and pack tuna and crackers in your backpack. This way, you will not be stuck getting something from the vending machine when you are looking for a snack.


Only pack non-perishable items in your locker and your backpack, as you do not want to reach for your snack to find that it has gone bad.

, Try to make your household chores more physical by offering to do labor intensive, outdoor chores like raking leaves, shovelling snow, or tidying up the yard. This way, you can burn calories and follow through on your responsibilities at home.


You can also make a game out of your chores by challenging yourself to get them all done within a certain time period or as a race against a parent or a sibling. This will encourage you to move fast and burn some calories while you do your chores.

, Opt out of the bus or a ride home and walk or bike instead. This is a good option if you do not live too far away and have the advantage of a warm climate where you live.Alternatively, you may decide to take the bus to school in the morning and walk home after school to add some exercise to your day. You may also challenge yourself to bike around on the weekends to visit your friends, as this will allow you to do something physical.

, To stay in shape, you should try to add small workouts to your day. This could mean doing a few push ups or sit ups between commercial breaks from your favorite television show, or doing 30 minutes of running between doing your homework and playing a video game. Try to integrate small workouts into your day so it feels less daunting and overwhelming to do them.Once you get more comfortable with mini-workouts, you can gradually add on more exercise to your routine. This may mean going for a jog or a run after you have done a few push ups or making a routine where you do push ups, sit ups, and chin ups at home.

, One of the best ways to add physical activity to your daily routine is to join a sports team. Ask your parents if you can try out for a sport you enjoy or want to try. If you have an existing athletic skill, talk to your parents about getting better at it with coaching or training. Starting a sport or athletic hobby early can be a good way to stay fit as you get older., Enlist the support of your family by rallying everyone to exercise together. This could mean going for a family walk before dinner or on the weekends. Maybe you can help your parents plan a biking trip or a kayaking trip. Get your family to sign up together for a charity run or walk and train together. This will allow you to feel motivated to get fit and supported by your family to do so."

Sign up for Pilates classes.",How to Get Rid of Back Pain2," Do 6 5-minute sessions of walking. Then, begin increasing the time you walk and reducing the number of walking sessions.


For example, the first week, do 6 5-minute sessions. Then, do 4 8-minute sessions the next week. Do 2 15-minute sessions the third week, and work up to at least 1 30-minute session per day. This resembles the recovery therapy for modern back surgeries.

Push-ups, a classic for a reason.,
Squats.,
Walk.",How to Get in Shape without Hitting the Gym," Flex your arms, butt, or legs, now hold it for about thirty seconds to one minute. This is a great, and subtle, exercise, especially for desk jockeys, as you can do it even while sitting down. It promotes leanness and toning of muscle.;
, First step: Buy a set of dumbbells. I recommend starting at ten/fifteen pounds for men, and five/ten for women. Once or twice a week, weight lift for about twenty minutes, or until your muscle fails and you can't lift the weights anymore. Why do this? Studies show that when your muscles are stressed to the point of failure, they add mass*(see tips)*, and therefore strength. How to do it: Count 2 on the way up, and count 4 on the way down. Any faster than that and you are cheating with momentum.

, You'll work your chest, shoulders, triceps, back and abs.


Position yourself face down on the floor, balancing on your toes/knees and hands. Your hands should be wider than shoulders, body in a straight line from head to toe.
Don't sag in the middle and don't stick your butt up in the air.
Slowly bend your arms and lower your body to the floor, stopping when your elbows are at 90 degrees.
Exhale and push back up. Variations include incline, decline, wall pushups or, for masochists, one-armed pushups.

, Squats can be done before dinner, right before work, whenever! They work your glutes, quads, hamstrings and calves all at once. How to Do it: Stand with feet hip-width apart, toes facing straight ahead or angled slightly outward. Slowly bend the knees and lower hips towards the floor, keeping your torso straight and abs pulled in tight. Keep your knees behind your toes; make sure everything's pointing in the same direction. Do not go lower than 90 degrees.

, A brisk twenty minute walk every night doesn't necessarily stress your muscles, but it will help keep your heart healthy. The human body was meant to move, to stretch, to bend, and by staying still we're not helping ourselves. So don't feel silly jogging in place for a minute, or squeezing your butt until your muscle trembles. It's good for us .

Add short bursts of intense activity.,
Do hard circuit training intervals for a short period.,
Increase the difficulty of the exercise.,
Perform an aerobic exercise at your max level for a short period of time.,
Do interval training.,
Try Tabata-timing HIIT.",How to Get More from a Short Workout1," One way to increase the effectiveness of a short workout is to push yourself by adding short bursts of intense activity. Choose a time length, and then give the activity everything you have for that short duration. Then, recover by doing the activity at a more moderate pace for a few minutes.For example, if you are walking, add in 20 to 30 second sprint runs. After a two minute warm up, sprint as fast as you can for 30 seconds. Then, recover by walking at a moderate pace for two minutes. Repeat as many times as you can.
You can do this with any aerobic activity, such as walking, dancing, cycling, swimming, rowing, stair climbing, or anything else.;
, If you have seven to 10 minutes, you can get an overall workout that pushes you and is effective. For the duration of the workout, you should push yourself during each burst of activity. You should feel around an eight on the one to 10 toughness scale. It may be uncomfortable and hard, but it’s over quickly.The way you should approach this workout is with 30 seconds of hard, as much as you can activity, followed by 10 seconds of rest.
You can choose a different exercise for each 30 second interval, or you can choose few and go through two or three rounds.
Examples of exercises to do during this workout include jumping jacks, burpees, pushups, mountain climbers, crunches, step ups, squats, dips, plank, high knees, and lunges.

, Another way to get more from shorter workouts is to increase the intensity of whatever exercise you are doing. You can do this by performing the exercise at a faster pace or doing a harder variation.For example, instead of doing regular squats, do jump squats or tuck jumps. Try walking lunges or jump lunges.
Instead of regular jogging, try running with high knees or butt-kickers.

, Another way to get results from a short workout is to push yourself to your max effort level for a time. This means you are doing the activity the fastest you possibly can for the duration of the workout. You should not be able to push yourself any harder, and by the end you should be completely out of energy and breath.Four to five minutes is a good length of time for this workout.
Choose an activity, like running, swimming, biking, stair climbing, or other aerobic activity. Do this activity as hard as you possibly can for four or five minutes. You should not pace yourself or be able to talk during the workout.

, You can get a lot from a short workout if you vary the intensity of your effort throughout the workout. You break the effort into an easy pace, a moderate pace, and a hard pace. You can decide how many effort levels you want, as long as you are varying the intensity of the intervals as you work out.A common way to do this is to follow the 10-20-30 method. You do an activity, like cycling or rowing, at an easy pace for 30 seconds. Then, increase to a moderate pace for 20 seconds. For 10 seconds, do the exercise as fast and hard as you possibly can. Keep repeating over the length of your workout.
If you are using a treadmill, it can be hard to get the treadmill up to speed fast enough to do very short intervals. You'll want your intervals to be more like 90 seconds of jogging followed by one minute of sprinting. Do this for about 15 to 20 minutes (remembering to warm up with five minutes of walking beforehand and cool down with five minutes of walking afterwards).

, Tabata is a style of workout in which you spend 20 seconds doing high-intensity activity then 10 seconds rest. You repeat this for four minutes, or eight rounds. Putting together two Tabata-timed moves can give you an effective and short workout.For example, you may start with eight rounds of high knees for 20 seconds, with 10 seconds rest. Then, you may go to eight rounds of 20-second intervals of burpees, followed by eight rounds of squats. Just about any cardio or bodyweight exercise can work for tabata training.
You can vary the exercise by doing a different exercise for each 20 seconds, going back and forth.
The key to Tabata is to push yourself as hard as you can for those 20 seconds.

Commit to the workouts each week.,
Find ways to rearrange your schedule to fit in the workouts.,
Vary your workout.,
Create a high-energy playlist.",How to Get More from a Short Workout3," Short workouts are more convenient than longer workouts because you only need 10 to 20 minutes. Many workouts don’t even require a gym, so you can do them in your home. You need to find time for these workouts in your week because if you are not consistent, you are not going to see any results.You should do the workouts at least three days a week. Three to six days will help you see results.

, Since the workouts are so short, you can fit them in to almost any time of your day. No matter how busy you are, you can find 10 minutes to do an intense routine. Look at your daily schedule and figure out when you would like to incorporate the workout.For example, you can do the workout right before you shower or right after you get home from work.

Depending on the workout, you may listen to a song or two and be done. Put together a playlist of songs that make you want to get up, move, and push yourself to your limit.


For example, you may choose music with fast tempos, songs that make you happy or excited, or songs that make you feel like you are strong and invincible.

Eat a nutritious diet high in whole grains.,
Consume lean proteins.,
Get plenty of fruits and vegetables.,
Focus on healthy oils and fats.,
Skip the sugar and alcohol.,
Eat less.",How to Get a Sexy Bikini Body1," Whole grains are those that include all of the original kernel, foods like oatmeal, quinoa, barley, and farro. They are naturally low in fat and an excellent source of fiber. Try cooking a new kind of whole grain for yourself, topped with some steamed vegetables and some baked meat for a nutritious and satisfying meal.The United Stated Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommends that women 19- to 50-years-old eat 6 ""ounce equivalents"" of grains a day, with at least half of those being whole grains. If you're over 50, the recommendation is 5 ounce equivalents.
An ""ounce equivalent"" means 1 miniature bagel, 1 small biscuit, 1 piece of bread or toast, 1/2 cup of cooked oatmeal, cooked brown rice, or other grain, or 1 small tortilla.;
, Lean meats are low in fat, and they provide a good source of protein. Some lean meats are fish, white meat chicken or turkey (without the skin), loin cuts of beef and pork, and game such as venison, rabbit, or elk. However, not all lean proteins are meat. Other lean proteins include beans, tofu, and egg whites.The USDA recommends that women 19- to 30-years old eat 5 1/2 ounce equivalents every day, while those over 30 eat 5 ounce equivalents.
An ounce equivalent is 1 ounce of meat, 1 egg, 1/2 an ounce of seeds or nuts, 1 tablespoon of a nut butter, 1/4 cup of cooked beans, or a 1/4 cup of tofu., If you’re trying to lose weight, focusing on fruits and vegetables is a great way to go, since they fill you up on fewer calories. Look in particular for dark leafy greens (kale, spinach), broccoli, beets, berries, apples, and citrus. All of these are full of vitamins and nutrients.Women 19- to 50-years old should eat 2 1/2 cups of vegetables every day, while women over 50 should eat 2 cups.Of course, these vegetables are mostly measured in cups, with some exceptions. For instance, when eating raw, leafy greens, 2 cups count as 1 cup. Also, you can count 1 large tomato as a cup, as well as 1 large sweet potato. You can also count 2 stalks of celery as 1 cup. However, if you're going to overindulge in any category, choosing non-starchy vegetables is a good idea. Starchy vegetables include things like carrots, potatoes, peas, and corn.
Women 19- to 30-years old should eat 2 cups of fruit each day, and women over 30-years old should eat 1 1/2 cups of fruit each day.Often, 1 piece of fruit equals a cup, such as a small apple, a medium grapefruit, a large orange, a large peach, or a large banana. When eating dried fruit, half a cup counts as a cup serving., You don't want to cut fat out of your diet completely. However, you do want to limit fats and focus in on healthy ones. Vegetable-based oils and fats are generally healthier for you, such as canola oil, olive oil, nuts, avocados, and olives, though oily fish is relatively healthy, too.If you're a women, you're allowed 6 tablespoons of oils in the 19- to 30-year-old range, and 5 tablespoons in the 30 and over range. If you're trying to lose weight, you may want to cut back by a tablespoon or two.
Remember, you'll be getting some fat from your diet. Fat is in meat, butter, milk, and other dairy, as well as mayonnaise and salad dressings. For instance, here are some equivalents of 1 tablespoon of oil: 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise, 2 tablespoons of peanut butter, 1/2 avocado (medium), 2 ounces of Italian dressing, 1 ounce of nuts, and 1 ounce of sunflower seeds.

, Both sugar and alcohol add empty calories to your diet, and you don’t need that. Be careful when figuring out what in your diet might have sugar. Corn syrup appears in many common processed foods, so check what you’re eating thoroughly. Drink water, not fruit juice or soda, which cuts a large amount of sugar from your diet, if you drink these beverages often.

, If you’re eating right and you're still not getting to the weight you want, eat smaller meals. By consuming fewer calories, your body will typically start shedding the pounds. Be sure to eat enough that you are not feeling faint or unwell. Do not starve yourself because you think it will get you the body size you’re looking for. It’s not worth it.


Try a weight loss calculator to figure out what how many calories you should be eating to lose weight. You input information such as your weight, height, and activity level, as well as the goal you want to reach, and it tells you how many calories you should eat a day to reach your goal in a specified amount of time.
Make sure you don't consume less than 1200 calories a day, as that can be unhealthy."

Others include wax that you heat, apply, and then attach with a fabric piece.

, If you’ve never done it before, it might be a good time to go to a professional. It’s also difficult to see some of the parts of your own body you’re trying to wax, and another person can do it more easily.

, Exfoliating just means getting rid of dead skin through either chemical or physical abrasion. One easy way to exfoliate is to use a washcloth or exfoliating glove in the shower. You can also try a body scrub that has a physical exfoliant added. Just rub it in, using circular motions, and then wash it off., Since many of us don’t regularly remove the hair in our bikini region, the skin can become sensitive or rough. If you’re waxing, chances are you'll find some oils or lotions in an at-home wax kit that you can use after you wax. Similarly, a professional will work to moisturize your skin at the salon. If you’re shaving yourself, be sure to use lotion to soothe your skin. As the hair starts to grow back in, keep using lotion to help your skin., Many people want to have tan arms and legs when they're in a bikini. If you're one of them, consider choosing an option that doesn't expose you to skin cancer. One of the best options if you're going to be in the water is an extender, also called a sunless tanner. These products work with the proteins in your skin, producing a darker layer of skin, rather than simply staining it.The best tanners of this type to use are ones with dihydroxyacetone (DHA). This additive has been given a thumbs up by the FDA.
You can apply this tanner at home yourself, or go to a salon that uses a full-body spray. The full-body spray will be more expensive, but it will give you a more even tan.
This type of tan, like the kind you get from the sun, will wear off in a few days.

Act confident.,
Practice ahead of time.,
Don't just stick to one style.,
Swear off the haters.",How to Get a Sexy Bikini Body4," Confidence is a sexy trait, so one of the easiest ways to get a sexy bikini body is to simply act confident. It doesn't matter if you feel the confidence, as long as you're showing it through your body language, though showing confidence often leads to you feeling more confident, too.For instance, make sure to stand up straight with your shoulders back. Don't slouch over. Also, put on your best, flashy smile.

, If you're not used to being in a bikini, it can help to try it on a couple of times before you go out in public. If you're comfortable wearing it around your own place, you'll be more comfortable going out in public.While you've got your bikini on, spend some time in front of the mirror, and force yourself to give yourself a compliment. Find something good to focus on, such as saying, ""Look at those amazing hips!"" If you can't find something good to say about the way you look, say something about what your body does for you, such as, ""I may not like the way my thighs look, but they've always gotten me where I need to go. Thanks, thighs!""

, You may think there's only one type of bikini, and if you don't look perfect in it, you can't wear it. However, you'll find there's a wide variety of bikini types, and you may find one that you love and feel comfortable wearing just as you are.For instance, you may prefer a halter top or a bikini with tiny shorts instead of a typical bikini.

, Some people may tell you your body doesn't belong in a bikini, no matter what your size. It's not their place to tell you what you can and can't put on your body. Let any comments roll off your back, or tell them, ""Only I get to decide what I think looks good on my body, and I think I look amazing in this bikini. So go away."""

Buy some at-home equipment.,
Do exercise videos at home.,
Perform small workouts throughout the day.",How to Find Time to Exercise As a New Mom1," If you are unable to leave the house to exercise away from home, buy some equipment to use at home. When your baby is napping or playing, you can take some time to work out while watching your baby.Buy some hand weights, a jump rope, or a small step for a variety of workouts.

Circuit.",How to Get Exercise Outdoors," Hiking is a great exercise that works your legs and stimulates your body. You can go at whatever pace you feel comfortable. You're in a different environment, so your body doesn't recognize it as the usual day-to-day kill-yourself exercise. Hike at a nature center or a local park.;
, Whether you're mountain biking (which doesn't have to be on a mountain) or just biking in your neighborhood or to work, biking is a fabulous cardiovascular exercise.

, Do not go for a leisurely walk, but a real fast-paced sweat-provoking walk. Make sure you keep your legs moving enough to break a sweat! It may be beneficial going with one or two companions. However, you should work up to a rigorous walk, beginning with a ten-minute session, if necessary, and then expanding your route.

, If you're not sure where to find a tennis court, try out your local high school or park. Get one or a couple of friends and attempt to play tennis! Even if you're completely inexperienced, it's fun to try. It may make your arms and back sore the next day, so break in easy.

, Not just the normal, every-day running. Most people when they hear the word ""running"" they think of Olympians or Prefontaine. Running does not have to be long distance. You can do hill sprints, sprints on the track, ladders, etc. Mix it up!

, It's a great mode of transportation and is capable of doing tricks (if you can handle that!). Try to use both legs so that you aren't working only one calf muscle. Always remember to stretch afterwards and maybe go for a jog because your muscles tense up.

, This is a fantastically fun sport. Make sure you go with someone experienced. Be prepared to have sore back, shoulder, forearm, and hand muscles!

, Yoga is a miracle-worker. Some people shudder at the word ""yoga"" thinking that it is some idol-worshipping sport. Have no fear, for yoga can be done without doing any meditation or mantras. Practice the yoga poses and stretches for an unbelievable lactic/toxin-releasing muscle-building exercise! You can go to a local park or just out on your lawn; either way, you will feel rejuvenated after yoga (the ""during"" part may be unbearable!)

, Find a field or track and do circuits! Lunges, jump-roping, push-ups, abs, squats, and various other exercises are great!

Suggest a weekly walk-and-talk session, form a friendly fitness club, or try a new class at the gym together.;
, As you go about your day, imagine there's a magnet pulling your belly button back toward your spine. Practice the tuck until it becomes comfortable, and soon this easy ab-engaging move will become like second nature.

, If you want to burn the most belly fat, a Duke University study confirms that aerobic exercise is the most effective in burning that deep, visceral belly fat.In fact, aerobic training burns 67 percent more calories than resistance training or a combination of the two, according to the study.

, One more reason to go after those dust bunnies: vacuuming is a great ab workout. Tighten your abdominal muscles while you push back and forth for a tighter tummy while you clean.

, While you're driving, sitting, or just waiting at the doctor's office, imagine there's gum or wet paint on the back of your chair so you have to hold yourself up instead of leaning back. Keep shoulder blades down and back, abdominals lifted, and picture yourself knitting your rib cage together and in.

, Kayaking is an exhilarating, ab-crunching workout. Constant paddling requires lots of twisting and tightness from your abs for long periods of time.

, Swing a few backhands and forehands and you'll feel your abs getting tighter after just a few sets. You'll strengthen your obliques with every stroke.

, Hold a resistance band taut between your hands and lie on the floor face up, with legs extended and arms overhead. Pull abs in, tuck your chin, lift your arms toward the ceiling, and roll head, shoulders, and torso up and over your legs as far as you can. Keep heels firmly on the floor and reach hands towards your feet. Pause, then slowly roll back down.


Do 5 to 8 reps with 30 minutes of cardio 5 to 6 times a week.

, Get into plank position with arms and legs extended, hands beneath shoulders, and feet flexed. Keeping your abs tight, bend your left leg out to the side and bring the knee toward the left elbow. Pause, then return to start. Switch sides.


Do 20 reps, alternating sides, with 30 minutes of cardio 5 to 6 times a week.

, Target your deepest ab muscles with boat pose: Lie face up on a mat with arms straight up over chest. Lift your upper body off the ground by rolling through the spine. At the same time, raise your legs so that you're balancing on your butt, knees bent and shins parallel to the ground. Slowly roll back down onto the mat, lowering legs. That's one rep.


Do 5 reps per set, resting 30 to 60 seconds between sets.

, Lie face up with arms out to your sides, palms down, and legs bent at 90 degrees so feet are off the floor. Keep abs tight and slowly lower legs to the left as far as possible, keeping shoulders on the floor. Pause, then return to start. Repeat to the right.


Do 20 reps, alternating sides.

, Get into a crunch position—lie on your back, knees bent, feet flat on the floor, shoulders and head off the floor with your abs contracted. Then have someone throw an exercise ball (or basketball) to you—first to your left side so you have to twist and reach to catch it, and then to your right. Do this as many times as is comfortable, and try to increase the number each week.

, Take your workout indoors with boxing. Aerobic kickboxing is more than just a great belly fat-burning, cardio workout. All those arm thrusts and high kicks firm abs, too.

, Stand as much as possible when doing strength training exercises. That way your abs will naturally help to balance and stabilize your body.

, For every 10 grams of fiber you eat daily, your belly will carry almost 4 percent less fat.Enjoyable ways to increase your fiber consumption: two apples, ½ cup of pinto beans, one artichoke, or two cups of broccoli will all give you 10 grams of belly-flattening fibre., Too much salt will make you retain more fluid, which contributes to a puffy appearance and extra water weight.

, Just half an avocado contains 10 grams of MUFAs (monounsaturated fatty acids), which halt blood sugar spikes that tell your body to store fat around your belly.Eat these in ¼ cup servings to ward off belly fat without overdoing it.

, Salmon and other fatty fish are rich in the same omega-3 fatty acids as many belly-fat-busting foods.Try poaching your fish for a low-calorie way to enjoy this lean protein.

, Sunflower seeds are packed with tons of MUFAs and B vitamins, which play an important role in protecting against inflammation.Sprinkle two tablespoons on top of your salad and stir-fries.

, One serving of peanut butter has 2 g of fiber and 8 g of protein, on top of belly-busting MUFAs.Try this easy recipe to add a flat belly punch to dinner: Toss a half-cup of whole grain noodles with 3 ounces cooked shrimp, minced scallions, and ¼ cup sliced red bell pepper. Dress with a mixture of 2 tablespoons peanut butter, 2 tablespoons warm water, and a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes.

, Forget water weight: Drinking lots of water helps flush bloat that your body might be holding onto.

, Where do you think all those bubbles from carbonated drinks end up? Swap soda, diet soda, and seltzer for water, a natural, zero calorie, lifesaver.

Look for Feedback.",How to Find Treadmills for Home," Depending on which area of your body you would like to work on, you can choose different types of fitness equipment. Treadmills are great to work out the whole body, but if you do have specific areas, you might be looking for different fitness equipment. There are new and improved models coming out every year, so you will surely find a suitable one for your abs, legs and even arm. There are different products developed for men and women, and you will have to consider your workout preferences, too.;
, The price of fitness equipment– even for home use – is extremely high these days. That is why you will need to determine the functionality and the price you are looking for. If you do only have one night every month when you would like to set up the gym, or call your mates over for exercise, it is not worth to spend thousands of dollars on treadmills. But if you want to call your mates over couple of times a week after work, you might need professional equipment.

, Space is important. You should make sure that the fitness equipment can either be folded or fits comfortably in your separate room or folder. Many marriages have been broken up because of unused treadmills in the middle of the living room. If you are really short of space, look for a flexible option that is easy to put away and set up. But you don’t want to exercise in a stuffed room, for sure.

, It is important to know that the same models and functionalities are offered with a huge price difference by various retailers online and offline. If you want to buy fitness equipment over the Internet, you need to use a price comparison site. But the delivery charge should also be taken into account, when you buy the product. Some manufacturers’ outlets offer lower prices on top quality products, but you will have to

, And it will not be cheap for heavy fitness equipment.

, Before you buy fitness equipment, you should also check out forums and blogs, to see how it works and if people can achieve results by using them. There are different directories as well where you can see customer ratings, as well as the feedback score of the shop. You will need to ensure you are getting all the instructions for care and assembly, as well as a full warranty. It is not easy to put treadmills together, and a good users’ manual can save you from loads of hassle.

, Whatever your favorite type of exercise may be, you're more likely to do it if you make it a regular habit. If running is your thing, start running on a schedule. You can begin by just running a short distance once or twice a week. Over time, run longer distances more frequently. This is a great way to get in shape, because you set your own pace, and you control your own progress.

, Go on a hike with a friend, or take a walk in the park. Find a nearby fitness trail. You'll probably be too distracted by how good it feels to be outside to even realize that you're exercising.

Schedule exercise time into your work day.,
Set realistic goals.",How to Find Time to Exercise As a New Mom3," Your life may feel hectic, but one good way to get active and exercise with a newborn is to schedule it. By making fitness a priority in your life, you will be more likely to stick with it. Figure out when you can schedule 10 to 30 minutes of exercise in your day and stick to it.For example, you may be able to do a 30 minute workout in the morning or be able to schedule 15 minute HIIT cardio and strength training sessions in the morning and afternoon.

, Get your partner, family, or friend to watch the baby for 30 to 60 minutes so you can exercise. This gives you some time for yourself and also some time to exercise. You can exercise in the house, go to the gym, or work out outside.You can do a workout video, go for a walk or run around the neighborhood, or do some strength training or a class at the gym.
You can get up early and work out before you partner goes to work.

Instead, you may set a goal of walking or jogging for half an hour four times a week.

Make sure your hands and feet are clean.,
Plot your path.,
Check to see if there are grooves on the tree.,
Wrap your hands around the base of the tree.,
Walk up the tree trunk.,
Climb down carefully.",How to Climb a Palm Tree1," Before you get started, wipe off any dirt or sand residue that might be on the palms of your hands or the soles of your feet. Make sure your hands and feet are completely dry if you’ve recently been in the water. Moisture and grit can cause you to slip on the way up, making your climb more difficult.Climbing smooth, branchless trees like palms is all about getting sufficient traction against the trunk.;
, Look straight up at the tree trunk and examine its features from all angles. Observing how the trunk curves, where it narrows or gets thicker, and whether or not there are leaves or other protrusions sticking out can help you decide on the best route and technique. Try to find a path that is straight, free of obstacles and doesn’t require you to overcome an inclined curve.


Most palms and similar trees won’t have any sizable obstructions in the way, but you may encounter knotholes, loose bark and other potential dangers. Always scout the tree out before climbing. It will give you a better sense of where exactly you’ll need to place your hands and feet, as well as any unusual angles you might have to negotiate., There are many different varieties of palms and similar trees. On some palms, the fibrous bark grows in scale-like circular ridges around the length of the trunk. These types of palms will be much easier to climb, as the grooves will act as small hand and footholds. If the tree you’re climbing does not have grooves, you’ll need to be much more confident in your grip and technique.Grooved palm trees provide just enough of a ledge to hook your fingertips and toes on.
Smooth trees can still be climbed with ease; you’ll just have slightly less margin of error.

, Stand at arm’s length from the tree. Reach both hands around the base, one higher and one lower, and cup them around the trunk’s backside. Press your fingers firmly into the tree’s surface to get a solid grip. Lean your upper body back so that both arms are straight and pulling against the tree.In order to effectively walk up the trunk, you need to create and maintain a counterbalance each time you move a hand or foot.
You can bend your arms a little once you get moving, as long as they don’t lose tension.

, With your arms outstretched and your body leaning away, you should have enough space between yourself and the tree to get your first foot up on it. Place the foot around hip height. Then, push with your leg as you pull toward the tree with your arms. Lift your opposite foot and position it on the trunk above your first foot. At the same time, move your lower hand up and grip the tree above your other hand. Repeat this action, using the balance created by pushing and pulling simultaneously to stabilize yourself, until you reach the top of the tree.Take small steps. Don’t try to overreach. Placing your foot too high or pushing too forcefully against the trunk can make it hard to hold on with your hands.
To maximize your grip and agility, only the ball of the foot and toes should be in contact with the tree.

, When you’re ready to come down, reverse the walking motion and work your way down the tree slowly. Be careful—you’ll be in a less stable position while you’re descending. Alternate the placement of your hands and feet as you lower yourself, keep your arms taut and pushing against the trunk with your legs the whole time.Go slowly. Getting down is usually trickier than going up.
There may be times when you’re forced to slide your feet rather than taking individual steps. If this happens, keep your muscles tight and your hands moving so you don’t lose control.

Make a small circle with a rope.,
Loop the rope over your feet.,
Get into position on the tree.,
Pull with the arms while pushing against the tree.,
Shimmy your way up the tree slowly.,
Return to the ground safely.",How to Climb a Palm Tree2," A more expedient method of climbing involves using a rope, sarong (a length of fabric typically worn as a sash) or strand of natural plant fiber. The rope or other material should be between 3-5 feet long, depending on the girth of the tree. Fashion a circle out of the rope and tie it securely. You will be using the rope as a brace for your legs, which will enable you to scale the tree quickly and easily.Using a rope or another similar device increases surface area contact with the tree, which means you can use the strength of the tree to support much more weight with minimal effort.Test the knot you tied in the rope and confirm that it will hold before using it to climb.

, Twist the rope over in a Figure 8 configuration. This will ensure that the two sides of the rope stay together, and that it is strong enough in the center to hold your full body weight. Drape each looped end of the rope over the outer edge of your foot, near the ankle. Try not to let the rope drift out of place as you climb.Doubling the rope over in a Figure 8 shape also neatly creates two little stirrups, one for each foot.Once you’ve begun climbing, the rope loops should rest directly under the midpoints of your feet.

, Move in close to the tree and grip the back of the trunk with both hands. Hop up quickly and place both feet on either side of the trunk so that the rope is stretched tight across the front. With the high amount of tension on rope, you can now “stand” on the trunk as you climb. This will be even easier if the tree you’re climbing has grooves.Practice jumping onto the trunk and “standing” on the rope a few times near the bottom of the tree before going any higher.
The further your upper body is from the tree trunk, the more weight you’ll be able to rest on the rope. If you were to stand completely vertical, you would simply slide down the tree.

, Gain elevation by using little hops to bring your legs higher up on the trunk, then extend your body and reach to take a new grip. It’s important that you hold on tight and push into the tree with the rope in order to steady yourself. Time your movements so that your feet are in a stable position when you reach, and you’ve got a decent handhold before you bring your legs up.Your feet should be pointed at a downward angle so that you can grip and press into the trunk with your toes.
Just like the walking method, the key is finding the right balance in tension. The legs push away from the trunk and give you room to move, while the arms pull you towards it and upwards, keeping you on the right track.

, Continue hopping and pulling to climb to the top of the tree. Take your time and be certain that the rope is anchored before reaching for your next handhold—rushing might cause you to slip. If at any point you start to get tired, you can rest by crouching with your weight over the rope and hugging the tree tight with one or both arms.


Make each hop controlled and concise. Only try to move 1-2 feet each time.
Think of the climbing motion as two repeated steps: hop, reach, hop, reach.

, Getting down from the top of the tree is as easy as sliding down. Let your hands grip the sides of the trunk loosely to help you control your weight on the weight down. Don’t let your knees or forearms rub up against the trunk as you slide, or you might scrape them. You may have to use a combination of sliding and scooting motions to descend quickly if the tree is grooved.It’s a little easier to slide down if you’re climbing with the aid of a rope or sarong, as there is less risk of scraping up your feet.
Never drop from so high that you can’t make a safe landing."

Go for a walk or a jog.,
Play a game of tennis.,
Play soccer.,
Take a dance or aerobics class.,
Go hiking and enjoy nature.",How to Exercise With a Broken Wrist1," Walking and jogging have many health benefits and can be easily done with a broken wrist. Depending on your exercise goal, you can adjust your distance and intensity to make the exercise harder.Be sure to keep your wrist in a neutral position while walking.
Slightly tighten your stomach muscles and keep your back straight to engage your core muscles.
Regular walking and jogging have many health benefits, including strengthening your bones and muscles, helping to maintain healthy weight, and improving coordination and balance.;
, Tennis is one of those sports you can do one-handed. It also gives nice variability to walking and jogging. As with walking, keep your broken wrist in a sling in a neutral position at all times while using your uninjured hand for playing.Besides burning fat and improving your cardiovascular fitness, tennis also helps build muscles in your legs and especially in the arm and shoulder you are playing with.
Jumping and running will also help improve bone density and bone strength.

, Soccer involves a lot of running and is a great way to improve your cardiovascular fitness, while having fun with your friends. Secure your broken wrist in a sling and get your feet kicking., Besides offering the same health benefits as the exercises above, dancing/aerobics does it with style. And if you get tired of one type of class, switch it up and try the different choices available, such as jazzercise, Zumba or step aerobic class.Be sure to have your wrist positioned neutrally and avoid all moves that engage it (perform these with one hand only).

, Hiking is an excellent workout that can be very strenuous depending on the route you take. Climb up those hills carefully, as you do not want to fall and further injure the wrist. Walking uphill will increase your cardiac output and burn some extra calories. Don’t forget to enjoy the scenery. Besides improving your fitness, this can be very relaxing and stress-relieving as well."

Strengthen the muscles in your legs.,
Strengthen the muscles in your back.,
Strengthen your abdominal muscles.",How to Exercise With a Broken Wrist2," You can engage the different muscles in your body without using or disturbing your broken wrist. To strengthen the muscles in your legs, do simple squats and lunges and keep your arms neutral on the sides of your body.


Do squats by standing in a wide stance, facing forward and keeping your back straight. While pushing your hips and butt back and knees slightly forward, squat down until your thighs are slightly past parallel to the floor. Remember to keep feet and knees pointed in the same direction. Your knees should never extend beyond your toes. Straighten and repeat.Do alternate lunges by stepping forward with one leg. Then, lower your body by flexing the hip and knee of the front leg until your rear knee almost touches the floor. Return up and lunge forward using the opposite leg., Although many back exercises require the use of dumbbells and weights, you can do bodyweight exercises that can be done with a broken wrist.


Do bridges by laying on the floor on your back with your arms resting next to your body. Keep your feet flat on the floor and knees bent. Slowly raise your bottom up until your knees and shoulders form a straight line. Remain in this position for 10 – 15 seconds, then lower and repeat.The dart is another exercise you can do with a broken wrist. Lie down on your stomach and keep your arms extended toward your feet next to your body. Lift your upper body and legs off the floor at the same time using your back muscles. Count to 10 – 15, relax, and repeat., Abs are easily worked with a broken wrist when you choose exercises such as twists and crunches.


To begin with crunches, lie flat on the floor with your lower legs on a bench. Keep your arm with your broken wrist on your side at all times, and bring your other arm up behind your neck. Raise your upper body from the mat by contracting your abdominal muscles. Raise your torso as high as you can while keeping your lower back on the floor. Bring your torso back down, and repeat.With twists, both your arms are extended out to each side while you lie on your back. Slightly bend your knees and raise your legs off the floor with your knees bent on a 90 degree angle. Next, lower your legs on one side until the side of your thigh hits the floor. Return to the middle and go to the other side. Repeat from side to side."

Do wrist flexion and extension exercises.,
Do hand flips.,
Try radial and ulnar deviation exercises.,
Stretch your wrist extensors.,
Stretch your wrist flexors.,
Do intrinsic flexion.,
Do MP extension exercise.,
Do finger and thumb exercises.",How to Exercise With a Broken Wrist3," Wrist flexion and extension are one of several exercises that are important to get your wrist back to the condition it was prior to the injury. However, do not start any of these exercises until your doctor tells you that you can. Start slowly and stop of if you experience any pain.


Place your forearm with the bad wrist on the table.
Have your hand face palm down and extend your wrist and hand past the table edge.
Move your hand up by bending your wrist and close your hand into a fist.
Next, lower the hand and relax your fingers.
Each position should be held for six seconds.

, This exercise should only be done after your doctor or physiotherapist gives you the go ahead. Do the exercise eight to 12 times but only if it is pain free.


Sit down and place the affected wrist and forearm on your thigh with your palm facing down.
Flip your hand, so that your hand is now facing palm up and resting on the thigh.
Repeat flips to alternate between palm down and palm up.

, Wrist radial and ulnar deviation is the motion of moving your wrist from side to side. Start slowly and if no pain is present, repeat 8-12 times.


Hold the hand with the broken wrist in front of you, palm facing down.
Bend your wrist slowly as far as possible, from one side to the other.
Each position should be held for six seconds.

, Wrist extensor stretch can be an effective exercise to get your wrist back in shape. When no pain is present, repeat this move two to four times.


Extend your arm with the broken wrist.
Point the fingers toward the ground.
Use your other hand and bend your wrist until you feel a stretch that is mild to moderate in the forearm.
Hold for 15 to 30 seconds.

, Wrist flexor stretch can be difficult with a broken wrist at first. Start slowly and do not overdo it if you feel pain.


Extend your arm with the broken wrist in front of you, palm facing away from the body.
Point your fingers toward the ceiling by bending your wrist back.
Use your other hand to bend the wrist gently toward you or press it against a wall.
When you feel a stretch in the forearm, stop.

, This is an exercise that will help to get your grip back after the injury.


Rest your broken wrist on the table one side against the surface, holding your fingers straight.
Bend your fingers toward you from the joint that connects your fingers to your palm but keep the fingers otherwise straight so that you form a 90 degree angle.
Return to the starting position and repeat.

, This is another exercise to help get your grip back and ideally should be done eight to 12 times per session.


With your palm up, have the good hand placed on a table.
Take your injured hand and enfolded the fingers around the thumb of the hand that is good.
Uncurl the joints slowly on the injured hand.
Have only two of the top joints bent from your fingers so that your fingers look like a hook.
Return to the position you started at and repeat.

, To get as much as possible out of these exercises, they need to be done as quickly as possible.Use the thumb on your injured hand and touch the tip of every finger with it. Do this as quickly as you can.
Have your injured hand face palm upward and bend your thumb to the little fingers base. Then, stretch it out as far as you can to the side.

Get a large triangular bandage to make a sling with.,
Take the triangular bandage and slide it under the injured arm.,
Pull the tip of the bandage.,
Pull the opposite side upward.,
Ask someone to assist you in tying a knot.,
Adjust the sling.",How to Exercise With a Broken Wrist4," When exercising with a broken wrist, it is recommended you use a sling to maintain the writs in a neutral position. Besides providing protection, the sling prevents the wrist from excess movement that could worsen the injury., The tip of the bandage should stick out farther than your elbow.

, Do this gently so that the tip is pulled toward the shoulder opposite of the affected arm and around your neck.

, Take the part that is hanging down and pull it over the injured arm. The tips should meet behind the neck.

, This step might be impossible for you do to on your own.


Above the collarbone, have your assistant tie the ends to a knot.

, Ask your assistant to adjust the sling so that it supports the arm all the way to your little finger.


Fit the sling around your elbow by twisting the tip with a safety pin or tucking it in.

Find your perfect climbing tree.,

Get a firm grasp on the tree.,

Don't use spiked shoes on the tree.,

Jump up and plant both feet on the tree.,

Practice just holding this position.,

Move higher.,

Keep safe.",How to Climb a Tree With No Branches," The tree should not have rotted or look dead as it could collapse or make you fall. Once you have found your tree with no branches, you need to adopt a good mindset to help you climb it. View the challenge of climbing the tree as meeting an adversary you need to overcome. This will put you in the right frame of mind.
, If you can interlock your hands behind the tree's trunk, you can get a nice grip. Otherwise, try to get your fingers into the bark. The goal of using your fingers is not to pull/hold yourself up, but to pull your body closer to the tree., This will cause damage to the soft plant tissue just under the bark. Use shoes with good, strong-gripping rubber or synthetic soles on the bottom., Quickly push out and up. Do this diagonally towards your face. In terms of physics, you must overcome gravity with your force pushing upwards while your outwards force will be met with the opposing force of your hands., If you can't stay there for close to a minute, you need more practice., To move up, push up with your feet, slide your hands up the tree and continue pulling. Then slide or shimmy your feet up to establish the position from step 4., Only go as high as you feel comfortable. Don't take unnecessary risks and keep a buddy on the ground in case you get into any difficulties. Then, come back down again as carefully and slowly as possible. Don't challenge yourself to climb a tree too big for you."

Repeat this series of motions to ascend.",How to Free Climb a Tree," Choose clothes that allow maximum flexibility. Avoid baggy clothing or accessories that can get caught on branches.


Necklaces are especially dangerous, as they can snag on a branch and choke you.
If you're wearing hard-soled boots, take them off and climb barefoot. More flexible shoes with good traction are fine.;
, Find a tree with large, sturdy branches, preferably ones you can reach from the ground. Avoid any trees with obvious signs of damage, including large cracks or cavities; swollen or odd-shaped trunks; mushrooms near the base; or more than a few dead branches.Not all signs of decay are obvious. If you haven't climbed the tree before, go slow and be prepared to return to the ground. Loose bark, soft wood, or unusually weak branches are all signs that the tree is not as healthy as it looks.

, Trees are much more dangerous to climb when they're wet and slippery, or when visibly swaying in the wind. Cold weather makes wood more brittle, so we do not recommend free climbing in winter. If you do climb in cold weather, stick to the lowest, largest branches.


Never climb during a thunderstorm, as trees are a prime target for lightning strikes.
Even mist or morning dew can make a tree dangerous to climb. Wait until the sun comes out and the tree has a chance to dry.

, In a perfect world, every tree has a large, horizontal branch at head level or below. You can usually reach this easily by jumping or pulling yourself up. If you need more leverage, brace one foot against a rough area of the trunk. Push into the tree, not down, or your foot is likely to slip.


After reaching the first branch using any method in this section, skip down to instructions on climbing higher.

, If the lowest branch is higher than your head, you'll need good upper body and core strength to pull yourself to the top. Bring your biceps and forearms up to the top of the branch first. Swing slightly to propel your elbows onto the branch, then your legs.If the branch is so high you have to fully extend your arms, this will be much more difficult. Try swinging back and forth until you have enough momentum to pull yourself up with your arms. Bring your stomach up to meet the branch, then bend forward and pull up the rest of your body. Try to do this in one motion to keep momentum.

, This more advanced technique can take some practice to achieve. It requires less upper body strength than the pull up, but more coordination and flexibility. Here's how to do it:Hand from the branch with both hands.
Swing one leg up and over the branch.
Pull yourself up until your biceps rest on top of the branch.
Lift your free leg up close to your face, then swing it backward while pressing down on the branch. This should swing the rest of your body up onto the branch.

, If the branch is too high to reach even when jumping, you'll need to gain leverage from the trunk. This is very difficult, so practice the other techniques first. When you're ready, try this for the difficult challenge:Run at the tree with moderate speed.
Plant your foot against the trunk, ideally against a gnarl or other stable area.
Push inward and upward with your foot. (Pushing down is a common mistake that causes your foot to slip.)
Jump with your other foot at the same time, and reach up to grab the branch with both hands.
Get to the top of the branch using one of the earlier steps.

, When free climbing, you should always have your weight on three different parts of the tree. In other words, of your four hands and feet, move only one of them at a time. This ""three point rule"" is the best way to reduce your chance of falling if you slip or if a branch breaks.Placing both feet or hands on the same branch only counts as one point of support.
Sitting on a branch does not give you any support, since it will not help you catch yourself if you're falling.

, Your best choice of foothold or handhold is always a sturdy, living branch. These are most stable directly next to the trunk.

, Dead wood is much weaker than living wood. Avoid areas with missing bark, obvious damage, or a different color than the rest of the tree. Do not use the broken-off stump of a branch as a handhold or foothold.

, When climbing upward, keep your body as close to the trunk as possible. Stay in the most vertical position you can to improve your balance. If you try to swing your leg to the side or lean to catch a branch, you're much more like to fall.

, When two branches grow close together, bark can grow out from the trunk and fill the gap between them. This bark is much weaker than the rest of the tree, and will likely break if you grab onto it. It can also form a wedge between the two branches, forcing them outward and making them more likely to snap.Use caution when climbing past these areas.


If the trunk itself splits, this can be a sign of major damage. Do not climb to this point or beyond, and return to the ground if you notice any weak branches or other damage. A U-shaped fork is typically more stable than a V-shaped fork, but there is no guarantee without a professional inspection., The USDA Forest Service limits free climbing to areas where the trunk is more than 4 inches (10 centimeters) in diameter.If trained professionals won't climb past that point, you should definitely stop there or well before it.

, If you're up for a challenge, you can use the techniques below to climb a palm tree or other tree without branches.This is easiest if the trunk is leaning slightly, and is thin enough to reach the left and right sides at the same time.


A steep angle could mean the tree is weak or in danger of uprooting. Avoid these trees unless an experienced climber tells you it's safe.

, Tie a strip of strong cloth into a loop. Insert both feet into the loop, stepping on it with your soles. When gripping the sides of the trunk with your feet, as described below, this cloth will press against the front face of the trunk, improving your grip.

, Grip with the whole length of your arm for greater leverage.

, Bring your knees up above your hips, placing your thighs against the side of the tree.

, Grip with your thighs, calves, and the soles of your feet. If this is painful, you may need to stop and train your hip flexibility before trying again.


Some experienced climbers grip the sides of the trunk with extended arms, and place both feet against the nearest face of the tree, ""walking"" up the tree. This is very risky for a beginning climber, or anyone without significant limb strength.

, Bring your thighs upward to raise yourself and straighten your legs. Keep gripping with your calves and feet during this motion.

, Make sure you have a firm grip on the tree with both arms. Quickly bring both knees up at the same time, then grip with your thighs, calves, and feet again. Move both legs at the same time.

, Now it's time for your legs to keep you on the tree, while your arms move higher. Pull them up at the same time, while still wrapped loosely around the trunk. Move them quickly and grip again after a short distance.

, Straighten your legs, move your knees up, and move your arms. Repeat these three motions to gradually move up the trunk. As a beginner, move slowly and pause after each motion to judge your stability. Loose bark or a swollen area of the trunk could be fatal if you're moving too fast.

Grip the tree between your hands.,
Place your feet against the sides of the tree.,
Push yourself up with your feet.,
Bring your feet up.,
Repeat.,
Pick the coconuts.,
Descend.",How to Climb a Coconut Tree1," The first coconut tree you climb should be small, ideally low enough that you can grab onto the base of the fronds while standing on the ground. At minimum, pick a tree that you can wrap your arms around. A tree leaning at an angle will also be easier to climb.;
, Choose a strong material, such as coir, jute, or burlap, or a coil of strong, thin rope. Tie each end of the strip into a loop, just big enough to wrap around the soles of your feet.When complete, you should be able to flatten the strip against the coconut palm, with your feet on opposite sides of the trunk.


While you can climb a tree without any gear at all, this loop will make the task much easier.

, Place each foot through a loop on either side of the strap, and tighten securely with a strong knot. Now, when the base of your feet grip the sides of the tree, the cloth will press against the tree as well. This helps keep your feet stable, and gives you more leverage to push yourself up the tree.


Take off your shoes and socks before doing this. Climbing can hurt if you're not used to going barefoot, but your skin will toughen up with practice. If you really want shoes, try a special pair of climbing shoes with plenty of traction and flexible soles.

, Press one hand against the trunk in front of you, at chest level. Press the other hand on the opposite side of the tree. Your arms must be strong enough to hold your weight, so you are leaning into the tree instead of dangling away from it.


Some people feel more secure placing both hands at the back of the tree. If you do this, place your hands near the sides, where the trunk is curving round to the back. Your hands need to be at least partly opposite each other, so you can squeeze the trunk.
For trees too thick to wrap your arms around, find a second strip of strong cloth, leather, or rubber. Loop it around the trunk, and either grip it in your hands or tie yourself securely inside it. Start on a small tree before trying this.

, Hop onto the base of the tree, gripping it with your legs. Turn your feet inward, so the undersides of your feet press against the left and right sides of the trunk. Your legs will be bent and splayed outward, like a frog's.Make sure the loop around your feet is stretched taut against the tree.


Grip the tree with your thighs as well, if you are flexible enough to do so.

, Extend your legs without moving your feet or hands. This will bring you up straight, a little higher than before.

, Quickly bring both feet up at the same time, gripping a spot higher up the tree. To keep yourself stable, press hard with both hands. If your arms are strong, you can lift your feet completely off the trunk and position them again at a higher point.Otherwise, slide your feet up the side of the trunk, or push them up one at a time in small steps. This requires less muscle, but can be painful on soft feet.


Keep your foot on opposite sides of the tree, so the loop doesn't fall off your feet.
This is the most difficult part. Practice going up and down at the lowest levels of the tree, until you are confident that you have a firm grip.

, Now you're back in your starting position. Extend your legs to lift yourself higher, and rest here if you need to. When you're ready, bring your feet up another step, squeezing the tree between your hands.


Practice this near the base of the tree before aiming to go higher. Don't climb high enough to risk serious injury until you have had some practice. You should have enough arm strength and leg strength to climb without feeling tired or shaky, and enough flexibility to easily grip the tree between your feet.

, Once you are ready to climb to the top, pick a coconut by twisting it repeatedly until the stem breaks. Drop it on the ground, making sure there is no one nearby. Only pick coconuts easily within arm's reach, and never lean out away from the tree.


The fronds on the second or third level up are usually strong enough to hold onto, or even sit on. Do not grab the fronds on the lowest level, which are often weak.If you are skilled at using a machete, you can chop off coconuts with the blade. Tie the machete to a rope at your belt, so it dangles well below your feet as you climb.

, You can descend in steps just as you descended. Most people just move their hands lower one by one, while their feet slide down the palm. This can scrape or cut soft feet, but once you've toughened up this is the fastest way to get down."

Find a comfortable harness.,
Choose your rope.,
Use a palm climbing machine.,
Try a stick ladder.,
Climb with rope loops.",How to Climb a Coconut Tree2," The harness should be wide and padded, not a thin rock-climbing harness.Rope belts are used in some parts of the world, but these won't secure you nearly as well.


Read the instructions below first, to decide on a method of climbing the tree. You might be able to buy all your gear as part of a kit, to save money.

, Find a strong rope or webbing, with no significant stretch (or labeled ""static""). The rope should be braided, not twisted, so it won't send you spinning, although this is a little less important since you won't be dangling from the rope. Tree-climbing or ""arborist"" rope is the best choice., These devices attach to the tree and provide loops for your hands and feet. To ascend, all you need to do is alternate lifting your hands and feet, and the machine will do most of the work for you.It is still a good idea to secure yourself to the tree trunk using a length of rope and a harness, using the equipment described above.


There are several designs of climbing machines. Refer to the instructions specific to your model before you try to ascend.

, This is an easy, safe way to climb straight palm trees shorter than the stick ladder. Look for this equipment in hunting goods stores, since the ladders are often used to make hunting platforms. Follow these instructions to stay safe during your ascent:Assemble your stick ladder and lean it against the tree. Push it into the ground and clip it to a strap or length of rope tied around the tree.
Loop another strap or rope around the tree, and clip both ends onto your harness. Adjust until the strap is taut when you stand on the ladder.
Climb the ladder, periodically tying additional straps around the tree and onto the rungs.

, It is possible to make climbing easier and more secure even if you don't have any special equipment. Because your knots must be precise and high-quality, it's best to learn directly from an experienced professional. Here is the basic idea:Wrap rope around the tree, and fasten both ends to your harness.
With another length of rope, make a loop for one of your feet to stand in.
Attach the other end of this loop to the trunk by looping it around and tying a prusik knot.Repeat with a second loop for your other foot, and a third loop for your hands.
To climb the tree, lift one foot while pulling its rope higher with your hand. When you let go and put weight on that foot, the knot should hold the rope steady again. Alternate lifting each loop. Stay near the ground for your first several sessions, until you are confident you have the technique down and your knots are steady.

It's a low intensity activity that keeps your heart rate lower and doesn't cause deep or labored breathing.One study in particular showed that adults who walked three times a week showed improved fitness levels and had better control over their asthma after 12 weeks.Health and asthma professionals recommend doing a moderate to brisk walk a few times per week. However, you'll need to gauge how well you do with a moderate walk before advancing to more brisk or face paced walk.
Always warm-up before your walk and make sure to have your emergency inhaler handy just in case you need it. Aim for a 20–30 minute walk to start with if you're able. Work yourself up to longer times or a faster pace overtime.;
, You may think that swimming is a harder exercise to do aerobically; however, swimming is actually a recommended cardio activity for those suffering with asthma.Check to see if there's a pool in your area that you can use.


The reason that swimming is frequently recommended for asthmatics is because you're breathing in air that is highly humidified and warm. This is helps your lungs function better.
Try any type of water exercise that you have available. You can try water yoga, water aerobics, water walking or just swimming laps.
Aim for a 20–30 minute exercise session in the pool. If you notice your lungs do well and you can breathe well, you can consider increasing the length or intensity of your water exercises.

, Another great exercise for asthmatics is yoga. Its low-intensity and keeps your breathing and heart rate even. In fact, some yoga poses can help decrease some symptoms of asthma.A recent study showed that a beginner yoga class helped improve the quality of life of women who had asthma. Their symptoms were more manageable when they practiced yoga more regularly.If you currently do not exercise or haven't done yoga before, start with a beginners class or intro class. They're designed to fit all fitness levels.

, Like walking or yoga, leisurely biking is a low-intensity activity. It does not cause overly deep or heavy breathing and is easier on your cardiovascular system.Try to go for leisurely bike rides during the week. If you're physically fit enough you can aim for 45–60 minutes. If you haven't been exercising regularly, you may want to start out with 20–30 minutes of biking.
Competitive cycling or spin classes may trigger asthma symptoms. Make sure you are cleared by your doctor and have your emergency inhaler available if you try higher intensity cycling.

, Although long distance running or jogging can cause a flare in asthma symptoms, short jogs should be OK for most. Always talk to your doctor prior to beginning a jogging routine.


Health professionals agree that the types of exercises that can induce an asthma attack are high-intensity exercises, interval exercises or those activities that are done for a long period of time at a higher intensity.
Short bursts of moderate-intensity activities should be OK and are tolerated by most people with asthma.A short jog — about 20 or 30 minutes — can usually be tolerated well by someone who has asthma. If you are already active or can do 20–30 minutes of activity, a jog might be OK for you to try.
However, if your asthma frequently acts up with higher intensity exercises or is not well controlled, talk to your doctor before you start jogging.

, Whenever you have a chronic condition, it's important to speak to your doctor regularly and follow-up. With asthma, it's important to talk to your doctor about incorporating physical activity in a safe manner.


If you are not currently active, talk to your doctor about the appropriate way to include exercise in your weekly routine. Ask if there are activities you should avoid or if you should stick to any time limits.
Many doctors will also give you some tips on how to exercise safely and comfortably. For example, they may suggest swimming as a good exercise for you due to the humidity of the air.

, Asthma generally requires that you take medications regularly. Although there are no medications or procedures that can cure asthma, consistent medication use can prevent symptoms and provide a better quality of life.Many asthma medications work as you build up the medication in your body over time. Missing doses or being inconsistent can increase your risk of having symptoms or having an asthma attack. It is important that you follow the instructions and take your long-acting medications regularly to help prevent exacerbations, in addition to using your rescue inhaler for attacks.
Also make sure that you take your medications before doing any sort of exercise. This helps prevent symptoms from flaring during an aerobic activity.
If you're having regular symptoms but feel that you're taking your medication consistently and correctly, call your doctor immediately for follow-up.

, Asthma comes with very distinct signs and symptoms. When you suffer from asthma, it's essential that you know exactly how your body responds to medications and how it responds to triggers or allergens.Exercise can induce asthma symptoms in some people (generally referred to as exercise-induced asthma). Other people may respond to allergens like pollen or animal dander. Be aware of how much exercise or what activities typically set you off.
Also be aware of the signs of an asthma attack. Treating an attack quickly is imperative. Signs generally include: coughing, wheezing, tightness in the chest, difficulty breathing (both inhaling and exhaling) and shortness of breath.
If you are consistently experiencing these symptoms when exercising, you need to see your doctor to talk about starting asthma medications or changing medications.

, If you're looking to add in exercise or increase your exercise, try to do activities that are either lower in intensity or ones you do in short bursts. These types of activities are better tolerated by those with asthma.Asthma typically flares up during more high-intensity exercise or exercises that you do for a longer period of time.
If you want to do more moderate-intensity exercises, like jogging, only do them for short periods of time. This may vary for everyone depending on their fitness level and how well controlled their asthma is.

, If you have asthma, you know it's important to have a rescue inhaler nearby. Symptoms can come at any time and you need to be prepared. Since exercise can trigger symptoms, bring your emergency medication with you.


Even if you've never experienced symptoms during exercise, it's essential that you keep your emergency inhaler available just in case you need it.
Keep an emergency inhaler in your gym bag or purse so that you can access it at the gym. If you're going for a jog, stick your emergency inhaler into a running pack to keep it on you.
Keep track of the expiration dates on all of your emergency medication. If you don't use these inhalers often, it might be easy to forget that they've expired. Check them regularly to make sure you have an up-to-date inhaler with you.

, Warm-up exercises are recommended before any type of physical activity. They get your body ready for a more intense session. This is especially important if you have asthma.


Warm-ups are intended to get your lungs, heart and muscles primed for exercise. With asthma, it's important to focus on warming up your lungs. You do not want to instantly increase your breathing rate as this could spark an asthma attack.
Warm-ups need to be for at least five to 10 minutes. It's best to do a slower or lower intensity version of the exercise you're planning on doing.
For example, walk for 10 minutes before doing a 20 minute jog. Or do water walking before starting to do laps.

, An interesting issue with many asthmatics is cold air. Although not an allergen per se, cold and dry air can trigger asthma symptoms. This is especially true when you're exercising.Cold, dry air can trigger the bronchioles in your lungs to contract making it difficult to breath.
Rapid and quick inhalation or sudden exposure to cold air can trigger symptoms. When you're exercising, this increases your risk of experiencing symptoms due to the cold air.
It's important to keep warmer air flowing into your lungs until they are warmed up for exercise. When it's cold outside, wear a scarf over your mouth, breathe into your shirt or wear a face mask that covers your mouth. These items help warm the air before your breathe it into your lungs.

, Everyone with asthma has some sort of trigger. This is something that causes you to have symptoms or to have an asthma attack.If exercise causes you to have symptoms of asthma or to have an asthma attack make sure you monitor your overall intensity.
If pollen triggers symptoms of asthma, consider exercising indoors at home or at the gym. Exercising in a high pollen season can more quickly trigger an asthma attack.
Also be mindful if your triggers are animal dander, dust, mold or other household allergens. Doing a workout at home may be triggered by these allergens as well.

Wear safe climbing clothing.,
Attach a rope harness (recommended).,
Rule out trees with signs of damage.,
Pull yourself up to the lowest branch.,
Run and jump instead.,
Hold on to three points at all times.,
Start out slow before picking up speed.,
Hug the tree while climbing.,
Climb with your legs as well as your arms.,
React to signs of danger.,
Descend with caution.",How to Climb a Tree Quickly," Your clothing should allow for flexibility, but it can't be so baggy or loose that twigs can catch it. Also remove any dangling accessories; a necklace could easily catch onto a branch and choke you. Wearing a helmet is strongly recommended for fast climb attempts.;
, Climbing quickly increases the risk of a serious accident. A secure climbing rope and harness takes a little time to set up, but will allow you to ascend with greater speed and safety. If you're not willing to buy the equipment, consider these homemade safety features instead:


Throw a rope over a sturdy branch. Retrieve the end and secure it to the base of a tree with a high quality knot. This should be a static climbing rope, ideally protected against friction with a branch protector.Tie your own harness out of rope and attach it to the main rope with carabiners.
Once you're higher in the tree, swing a safety lanyard around another strong branch. Clip both sides to your harness., Search the ground for piles of dead branches, mushrooms, or raised areas where unstable roots are being pulled out of the soil. Circle the tree from a distance to inspect the trunk for missing or sunken bark, cracks, strange shapes, or swollen areas.Do not try to climb a tree with one of these symptoms.


A forked trunk can be a bad sign, especially if it's a sharp ""V"" or if you cracks spread from the joint. It's best to avoid these trees for fast climbing, since they require extra caution.

, Pick the lowest live branch that looks large enough to support your weight. If it's too high to pull yourself up easily, use the following technique:


Hang from the branch with both hands.
Pull yourself up so your biceps and forearms are on the branch.
Swing slightly to get the momentum to pull up the rest of your body.

Note — to get up there faster, get enough momentum to swing from a hanging position to placing your abs on the branch. You'll need good upper body strength.

, This difficult technique lets you rush up the trunk of a tree, jumping off to catch a branch out of reach from the ground. The key is to place the ball of your foot against the trunk and push up into the tree, not down. This will transfer your forward momentum upward, adding height to your jump. Grab the branch with both arms at the peak of your jump.

, Your hands and feet are your four attachment points to the tree. At all times, three of these should be anchored to different parts of the tree. Move one hand or foot at a time, and grip securely before moving the next one.

, Anyone can increase their speed by jumping at high branches or grabbing handholds without testing them. The hard part is to increase your speed while staying relatively safe. If you've only climbed trees for fun in the past, start taking it seriously now. Test each branch before you put your weight on it.


Get a sense for how big a branch needs to be to support your weight. This size varies by species and health of the tree, so practice with one type of tree

, Leaning out from the trunk or far to one side are big mistakes. You are in the most stable position when you are vertical, using the strong attachment points where branches meet the trunk.


Move out from the trunk only on the widest branches. Do not transfer from one end of a branch to another. Return to the trunk when you want to climb higher or lower.

, Many novice climbers use their arms much more than their legs, which is exhausting and slow. Look for footholds that require you to bend your knee up to hip level or above. Push into these footholds for extra leverage.


If the trunk is fairly thin, grip the sides with your thighs, calves, and the soles of your feet. This requires flexible hips, but can let you move faster past areas with few footholds.

, Soft, powdery wood or loose bark are signs of extensive damage, so return to the ground if you see them. Dead branches and broken off branch stumps will not support your weight. Move slowly past areas with moss or lichen, which can make the tree slippery.Stop climbing once the trunk has narrowed to 4 in. (10 cm) in diameter, if the trunk above you is swaying in the wind, or if it shows signs of damage., It's more difficult to test your footholds on the way down, so take it slow. Try to keep a mental map of your route on the way up, so you can use the same footholds on the way down.

For legs.,
For stomach.",How to Exercise Without Expensive Equipment2," There are many ways to lose weight on your legs. In fact, it's very easy to lose weight, you just have to be committed. Here are some ways to burn the fat on your legs.


Ride a bike. Riding a bike will actually burn fat all over but because you are using your legs a lot, it will focus on them. Ride to the park, ride to school, ride to work, ride across the country, ride to your mum's house, anywhere you can ride and not drive, ride there.
Walk. If you don't have a bike, do the second best thing, walking! But don't just walk, speed walk. Walking faster will force you to use more muscles and energy, burning more fat. You could even jog or run to your destination but if you feel awkward, walking is fine.
Stretches. That's right, stretches. Not only will stretches burn some fat, they will also make you more flexible and build muscle. You should always stretch before an activity anyway. Here are some stretches.

Bend over and touch your toes.
Place your leg on a higher object like a bed. Now bend forward and touch your toes.
Pull your leg back so the heel of your foot touches your waist. Hold your leg here.

;
, A lot of people want to burn stomach fat, here's how.


Focus on calorie burning exercise rather than sit-ups or crunches.
Add resistance training. A 2006 study published in the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism suggests that combining cardiovascular (aerobic) exercise with resistance training is more effective than cardiovascular training alone in getting rid of abdominal fat. You can do resistance training with free weights, exercise machines, or resistance bands. To get access to this equipment, you could join a gym.
Reduce your calorie consumption. Unless you restrict your calorie intake, you're not going to lose belly fat. There are some tactics that might help do away with belly fat faster (discussed below) but they are only effective when you've already consistently restricted your calorie intake. Keep a food diary for a week to see how much you normally eat per day. Once you have a baseline, a good starting point is to reduce that daily amount by 300 calories per day. Measure your waistline before you start cutting calories, and measure again a month later.
Switch out refined grains for whole grains. In a scientific study, people who ate all whole grains (in addition to five servings of fruits and vegetables, three servings of low-fat dairy, and two servings of lean meat, fish, or poultry) lost more belly fat than another group that ate the same diet, but with all refined grains. A diet rich in whole grains changes the glucose and insulin response in your body, which hastens the melting of fat, and visceral fat, that deep layer of fat, is easier for your body to burn than the subcutaneous fat under your skin (the fat that you can see and grab).
Walk as much as possible. Buy a pedometer and aim to walk about 10 000 steps a day. This ties in to losing overall weight too as you can't spot belly fat.

Join a gym.,
Make changes to your lifestyle to effectively build muscle.,
Bicep Curls.",How to Exercise Without Expensive Equipment3," You will need to join a gym to get access to all this equipment. If you really don't want to pay the price, skip the section about curls. In fact, just use something heavy in place of weights such as a shopping bag full of potatoes, make sure it's not too heavy though.

, This means drinking more water, eating more lean protein and fiber, and making more time to engage in vigorous, fat-burning exercise. Sleeping well is also important, because it keeps your body healthy and facilitates muscle growth. With that, read on for specific exercises that target your biceps.

, These are the best exercises for biceps. There are hundreds of different kinds of curls, each used to help work out a specific part of the body. Curls are done with dumbbells and barbells. Some of these are listed below:


Basic Biceps Curl. The standard biceps curl targets the whole muscle. Start by holding the barbell or dumbbell in your hands with your arms facing down. Keep your elbows straight and held in tight to your sides. Exhale as you bring the bar to the chest until your biceps are fully contracted. Then inhale as you lower it (don't drop it, do it slowly.) Repeat.
Concentration Curl. This curl targets the upper biceps. Sit down on a chair or bench with a dumbbell in one of your hands. Lean forward slightly and place your triceps (back of the arm) on the inside of your thigh. Inhale as your lower, and exhale as your bring it up to your shoulder. Switch to other arm.
Hammer Curl. The hammer curl targets the lower bicep. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing your leg. Exhale as your bring your forearm up until it touches your biceps. Inhale as you lower, keeping the elbows close to the body.
Body Drag Curls. In a standing barbell curl position, slide the bar upward against your body until it reaches your mid-chest level - about as high as you'll be able to move it without cheating it up - then lower the bar the same way, making sure it does not lose contact with your torso. Your elbows will move backward and your shoulders cannot assist in the movement.
Reverse Curls. Start by holding a dumbbell in each hand with your palm facing behind you, the top of your hand facing forward. In one swift movement, bring the dumbbell up at the same time as turning it. You should end up with your arm in the basic bicep curl position. Lower and repeat. This is a great exercise for both biceps and forearms.
Preacher curls. Preacher curls target most of bicep and help in increasing strength. Start by taking a barbell or a pair of dumbbells and rest your arms on the pad and press your chest against it. Curl the weight slowly and bring it back down. The preacher pad isolates your biceps as well. When doing these curls keep the bar right at the middle, not at the bottom or top. Then you will get really strong.

Start the first week by doing as many push-ups as you can COMFORTABLY DO.,
Repeat your set of pushups as many times a day as you can comfortably do.,
Make sure your push-up form is correct.,
Make sure that you get a lot of water to stay hydrated.,
Once you can do your normal number several times a day, add a few more push-ups to your routine.,
If you do this for at least a week or two you will see results and will be stronger.,
Do pushups nearly anywhere.",How to Exercise Without Expensive Equipment4," When you feel some meaningful strain, stop. This might be as few as 5 or 10, perhaps even less. You need to start small in order to get best results.

, You will want to work up to doing 10 sets a day, but, for starters, 3 is probably a good number to shoot for. If you punish yourself now, you will not keep up your program for very long.

, It is easy to put your butt up in the air and/or not go all the way down to the floor, or otherwise ""cheat"" on your form. But, if you do this, you will not be getting the value of your exercising. Your knees should be nearly locked, and your arms will be carrying the full load of your push-up. Your chest should nearly (but not quite) brush against the floor. With each push-up, your arms will be completely extended when you raise yourself up fully.

, Do the number you are comfortable with every day or day and a half, as this leaves time for your muscles to rebuild, strengthen and get bigger. You can take one day a week off, if you are feeling the effects of your routine too much.

, Be sure to tighten all of your muscles and they will build. You will need to be able to push yourself to get to your set goal for that week.

, Be sure to tie in push ups with other exercises too.

, During a TV commercial, before your shower, in a vacant room at work. It will only take a few seconds for each set.

Buy a bike, and bike to work every day.,
Walk to work 2 to 3 days a week.,
Park farther away from the building.,
Stand for half or all of your bus or train commute.,
Take the stairs when possible.,
Implement exercises while you wait for your ride or bus.",How to Exercise While Commuting1," This is best if your commute is 30 minutes or less and you have somewhere to store the bike at work. Judge if this is a good change for you based on how safe the route would be.


Remember that you don't need an expensive bike, but you should invest in a helmet and reflective tape. Buy a cyclist's hand-signal guide and follow these directions carefully. You may want to buy a backpack or messenger bag that is easy to carry, and bring a change of shoes for work.;
, Map out your route to work, and if it is 3 miles (4.8 km) or less, experiment with walking to work in shoes with good arch supports. You may find this is a great stress reliever after work, giving you time to breathe and exercise after a stressful day.


Make sure you have sidewalks or parks along the way that you can use. Never walk on highways, lawns or unsafe roads.

, Although this is usually seen as a bad thing, if you park a half a mile away from your office, you will get an extra mile of walking into your schedule each day.

, If you sit all day in a chair, choose to stand on the bus, even if there are seats. Hold on to a handrail and flex your deep stomach muscles to gain stability through braking or turning.

, Never ride the elevator for one floor. If you suffer from knee pain, always take the stairs up but take the elevator down.

, Do calf raises, where you lift yourself onto your toes and hold the position for 10 seconds. You can also balance on 1 foot (0.3 m) or the other for 30 seconds, and raise yourself up on your toes for the last 10 seconds.


An alternate exercise is marching. Instead of walking in place, engage your lower abdominal (ab) muscles and march, raising each thigh until it is parallel with the ground. Do this for 1 minute sets or until you feel muscle fatigue.

"
"
Begin with deep breathing exercises for 2 minutes.,
Exercise your eyes for 1 minute.,
Do the ""commuter crunch."",
Rock your oblique stomach muscles.,
Reach your hands upward toward the roof of the car or bus.,
Do isometric exercises.,
Do steering wheel isometrics, while stopped at a red light.,
Do steering wheel push ups.",How to Exercise While Commuting2," Inhale as big as you can so that your chest and diaphragm get very large. Exhale slowly letting out all the air in your lungs. Repeat for 2 minutes or the duration of 1 song on the radio.


The goal of this exercise is stress-reduction. It is important to exaggerate the breath and stop before you get too relaxed. Deep breathing for a long period of time can lead to deep relaxation and sleepiness.

, Allow your eyes to dart back and forth between your mirrors, or from side to side and up and down if you are on a bus. This will help you to be alert and avoid eye strain.

, Tuck in your pelvis and engage your lower abdominal muscles. Then, engage your upper abs and move your ribcage slightly toward your hips.


Hold for 10 seconds and rest for 3 seconds, but breathe through the entire exercise. Repeat 8 to 12 times or until your muscles start to become tired. Car commuters can do this when they are stopped in traffic or at a long light, while train, bus or airplane commuters can do this whenever it is comfortable.

, Flex your lower and upper abdominal muscles and then raise your right hip as high as it will go. Hold for 3 seconds and then lower and repeat on the left side.


Repeat 10 times on each side or until you feel muscle fatigue.

, Meanwhile, engage your abs and back muscles. Hold for 10 seconds while stopped at a long light.


Repeat 3 to 10 times, or throughout your commute. Do not do this exercise while driving and in motion.

, Imagine you need to flex every single muscle in your body. Begin by wiggling your toes and then flex each muscle 1 at a time for 3 seconds, until you reach your arms, neck and top of your head.

, Grip the wheel at opposite ends, and try to push your hands toward each other for 3 seconds, as if you are crushing the wheel. Rest and then grip the wheel and try to pull your hands away from each other for 3 seconds.


Repeat 10 times, or until you are no longer stopped. You can repeat the exercise at each stoplight, or until your muscles are tired.

, Place your hands at 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock on the steering wheel. Flex the entire length of your arms. Pull yourself toward the wheel for 3 seconds, and push yourself away from the wheel for 3 seconds.


Rest after 1 repetition and then repeat 10 times, till the light changes or until you have muscle fatigue.

Remove all loose jewelry and accessories, especially from around your neck, as these may snag during the climb.If possible, wear flexible shoes with good traction. If your shoes have hard soles or poor traction, climbing barefoot might be easier.;
, Find a tree with large, strong branches that can support your weight, at least 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter.Before you start the climb, step back far enough to inspect the whole tree. Avoid trees with any of the following signs of danger:Strange shapes or turns in the trunk. Leaning trees are risky but sometimes safe.
Deep cracks.
Large areas of sunken or missing bark.
A forked top is a sign of decay in conifers. Other types of tree might still be safe, but do not try to reach the fork.

, Approach the tree and inspect the lower trunk and the circle of ground 3 feet (0.9 meters) around it. These are all signs of a damaged or dying tree that is unsafe to climb:Mushrooms or other fungus growing on the tree or around the base.
Many dead branches on the ground. (A few dead branches attached to the lower trunk is common, but if they're falling from higher up, there's a more serious problem.)
A large hole or several small ones in the base.
Severed roots, or a raised or cracked area of soil next to the trunk (a sign of uprooting).

, Even if the tree is sturdy, weather conditions could make the climb more dangerous. Understand how the following affect your climb:


Never climb during a thunderstorm, or in strong wind.
Wet conditions can make the tree slippery and very dangerous to climb.
Cold temperatures make wood brittle. Plan on climbing slowly and testing every branch before you use it as support.

, There's one last safety step before you can get started. Look closely for the following dangers. These can be difficult to spot from the ground, so keep an eye out while climbing as well.


Never climb if there is a power line within 10 feet (3 meters) of the tree's branches.
Do not climb below large branches that have broken off and snagged in the tree. Climbers call these ""widow makers"" for a reason.Check the tree and nearby trees for bee and wasp colonies, or large bird or mammal nests. Avoid the trees immediately around these animals.

, If you can reach the lowest branch, grip it with one hand and wrap the other arm around the trunk. Place your feet on a sturdy gnarl, or grip the sides of the trunk with your thighs and calves. If the branch is too high to reach easily, try these advanced techniques instead:If you need to jump to grab the branch, do so right next to the trunk. See the next step for advice on how to get on top of the branch.
If you have strong legs, you can climb trees with a higher lowest branch. Run with moderate speed at the trunk. Plant the ball of your dominant foot on the tree and push upward against the tree while jumping with the other foot. Throw your arms up to catch the branch, or use one arm to grab the trunk and one to grab the branch.

, Now you're holding the branch from underneath. Depending on the height of the branch and the number of nearby footholds, you may be able to get on top of it just by pulling yourself up. Here are a couple techniques that help with more challenging trees:Pull Up: Pull yourself up so both biceps and forearms are resting on the branch. Swing and lift to get your elbows up on the branch, or all the way to your lower stomach if you have enough upper body strength. Swing your legs up to straddle the branch.
Leg Swing: Grip the branch with both hands. Swing one leg up and over the branch. Wrap your arms around the branch so your biceps are on top. Swing your free leg backwards while pressing down with your biceps to swing yourself on top of the branch.
If you can't reach any branches at all, try the coconut palm techniques until you reach the lowest branch.

, Once you're on top of a large branch, look for a secure route to the next one. Grip branches as close to the trunk as possible. If a branch is less than 3 inches (7.5 cm) in diameter, do not use it for more than one limb. When placing your foot on a small branch like this, wedge it perpendicular to the branch, where it meets the trunk.


Avoid broken branch stubs and dead branches. Dead wood may break without warning.
If the bark is loose and peels off when grabbed, the tree might be weak and dying. Return to the ground.

, When climbing without ropes, three of your four limbs should be anchored securely at all times. Each of these should be supported by a different part of the tree. Placing two feet on a branch counts as one point of support. Sitting or leaning counts as zero, since it won't help you catch yourself if your other holds break.The swinging and running techniques mentioned above for reaching the lowest branch are not safe for the rest of the climb. Only a very experienced climber should attempt to pull himself up onto a higher branch without footholds.

, Stay upright, with your hips directly below your shoulders whenever possible. Hug the tree as close as you can to increase stability. If the trunk is small, wrapping your arms or thighs around the side can improve your grip and slow your descent if you fall.

, These are areas where two branches have grown close enough together for bark to grow between them. The bark in between is not solid wood, and the branches are often weaker than they look., Looks can deceive when it comes to branch strength. Don't put your weight on anything you haven't tested.


If an area of the tree falls off in soft chunks, the wood is rotten. Trees rot from the inside out, so the tree could be very damaged even if most of the bark feels solid. Return to the ground right away.

, When climbing without ropes, always stop before the trunk narrows below 4 in. (10 cm) in diameter.You may need to stop well below this area if you notice weak branches or moderate winds.

, Don't lose your sense of caution when it's time to come down. Try to stick to the same path you used on the way up, assuming it felt safe.


Dead branches and other hazards are more difficult to see on the way down. Test footholds carefully before lowering yourself.

, If you're looking to climb trees for sport (or even for pay, working for a forest service or disaster relief), you'll need the right equipment to keep you safe. Here's what you'll need:Throw line. This is a brightly-colored, thin rope that gets literally thrown over the branch. It is attached to a weight, called a ""throw bag.""

Static rope. This type of rope lacks the stretchiness of ""dynamic"" rope using in rock climbing.

Harness and helmet. You can use a helmet like those designed for rock climbing. However, you want a harness specifically designed for climbing trees. A rock-climbing harness would cut off the circulation to your legs.

A Prusik cord. This helps you ascend. It's attached to your climbing rope and your harness with a carabiner. Alternatively, you can use a foot ascender.

Branch protector. Alternatively known as a cambium protector. These protect tree branches from friction, while helping your climbing rope last longer. Metal ones, which look like conduits, are more convenient than leather ones.

, You're looking to throw your rope over a branch that is, at the very least, 6 inches (15 centimeters) in diameter. Any smaller than that and it could snap. The bigger it is, the better. Here are a few other things to consider:Make sure it's healthy. If the tree is old, diseased, or dying, leave it alone.
The tree needs to be away from hazards, like power lines, animals, and nests.
Make sure it's big enough for your party. A spreading tree, like a hardwood, is best for large groups. Conifers are only suitable for one or two people.
Are you allowed to climb it? The last thing you want is to get into legal trouble for being on someone's property illegally.
Finally, consider its location in general. Is it easy to get to? Will it be scenic at the top? What will the wildlife be like?

, Just because a tree is big, sturdy, and in the right location doesn't necessarily mean it's fit for climbing. There are four zones you should consider in your inspection:The wide angle view. Often trees are better viewed from far away. That way it's easier to see an odd lean or an unstable branch, in addition to the commonly obscured power line.

The ground. Where you put your feet matters, too. You don't want to pick a tree that has too many knots at its base, a nest of hornets, root decay, or poison ivy.

The trunk. Missing bark on a trunk may indicate decay or recent attack, both of which weaken the tree. And as for trees with two or three trunks, inspect where they branch off from at the base. Weakness should be avoided here.

The crown. Dead branches at the bottom of a tree are normal (they haven't gotten enough sunlight); however, dead branches at the top mean the tree is dying. Any tree with plenty of dead branches (especially near the top) should be avoided.

, In the following steps, we will describe the double-rope technique, which is safer and easier for beginners. This method is especially common with oaks, poplars, maples, and pines (trees that grow around 100 feet tall).Here's how to start:


Toss your throw line over the sturdy branch you selected. You can do this by tying the throw line to a weight, or firing it in a specialized sling shot.
Place your branch protector on the rope.
Tie the static rope to the throw line. Pull on the other end of the throw line to drag the rope fully over the branch. The branch protector should end up over the branch.

, Tie a series of knots with the two ends of the rope, with a Blake's hitch as the main knot. The Blake's hitch should go slack when you take your weight off the rope, then hold you in place when you stop moving.


Tie a double fisherman's knot your carabiner.Warning: If you're not familiar with these knots, now is not the time to try them for the first time. Have an experienced climber tie these for you.)

, Make sure your harness is strapped on correctly and is snug. Once snug, attach yourself to the system with sturdy knots.

, If you have strong upper body strength for your weight, you may be able to climb with your arms alone. Most climbers will need a Prusik cord or a ""foot assist"" as well. The Prusik cord attaches to the main rope and provides an anchor for your foot. As you climb, you periodically tug the Prusik cord higher up., Typically, you'll be climbing the rope, using the tree as your guide or occasional foot support. When you're tired, just rest your feet on the trunk and continue when ready.

, If you're not quite ready to come down and feel up to a bit of a challenge, you can secure yourself to the branch and prepare to go higher. This will require placing new rope settings (called ""pitches"") over above branches. This is not recommended for beginning climbers., This is the simplest part: all you have to do is grab the main knot (the Blake's hitch) and gently pull down. Don't go too quickly! A safe descent is a slow descent.


Many seasoned climbers often place safety (slip) knots in their ropes to keep themselves from descending too quickly. But remember: if you let go, you'll stop. The Blake's hitch prevents you from falling..

, Once you're more experienced, you can try this approach instead. It's not hard to decipher from the name: instead of grabbing both sides of a rope, you climb just one strand, anchoring the other to a branch or the base of the tree.

Avoid over-the-counter pain relievers or decongestants before exercising.,
Eat yogurt as a snack before you work out.,
Bring along an ample supply of water.,
Cover your head and eyes.,
Jog in place or jump rope to warm up.,
Get in at least a half-hour of aerobic activity.,
Try yoga to improve your breathing.,
Move your workout to the pool.,
End your workout with steam.,
Stretch targeted muscle groups.,
Identify your allergy triggers.,
Check the weather forecast.,
Change the time of day when you exercise.,
Avoid open fields and bodies of water when exercising outside.,
Make sure the air is filtered in indoor environments.",How to Exercise when Dealing with Allergies," While decongestants can relieve your sinus congestion, they also increase your heart rate and can elevate your blood pressure.Decongestants also interfere with your body's ability to regulate its own temperature, while over-the-counter pain relievers can thin your blood.
Particularly if you're engaging in aerobic exercise, this can be a potentially dangerous combination because it may cause palpitations and/or symptoms of a heart attack or ischemia.
If you're taking a prescription allergy medication, you should continue taking it as prescribed. However, make sure at least an hour passes between the time you take your allergy medication and the time you exercise.If you're starting a new exercise program, talk to your doctor first to make sure it's okay.
Never take products that contain ephedra or ephedrine while exercising.;
, Greek yogurt contains probiotics that lower histamines in your body that cause the itchy, watery eyes, runny nose, and sneezing you experience during an allergy attack.Eating yogurt regularly may actually help your immune system function more normally, rather than over-reacting to allergens and making you feel sick.
Yogurt is a simple food that is easy to digest, and also includes protein and other nutrients that make it a good pre-exercise snack. Include fruit such as bananas in your yogurt to get a good blast of potassium, which can help prevent muscle cramps.Yogurt recommendations include those with at least 15 grams of protein per serving. These include products from Dannon, Oikos, and Chobani, like Chobani Simply 100 and Oikos Triple Zero.

, Whether you're exercising inside or out, staying well hydrated is important if you want to keep your allergy symptoms at bay. This is especially important if you're taking an allergy medication, which often dries you out.Drink water regularly throughout the day to make sure you're well-hydrated before you begin exercising.
Sip water while you work out, rather than guzzling – the liquid sloshing around in your belly could make you nauseous, especially if you are also dealing with allergies.
Keep in mind that if you're breathing through your mouth due to a stuffed-up nose, your mouth and throat may be dry even through you're not dehydrated. You may want to use a spray for dry throat and mouth, or suck on a lozenge. Just make sure you don't have a lozenge in your mouth while exercising – you could choke.
Take a 32 oz water bottle with you when you work out so that you have it by your side at all times.

, Wearing a hat and sunglasses can reduce your direct impact with pollen if you're exercising outdoors. This can significantly decrease your allergy symptoms, particularly itchy, watery eyes.Sunglasses will keep the pollen out of your eyes, while a hat will keep it out of your hair. Since pollen does rest in your hair, a hat is helpful for keeping long hair out of your face and eyes while you're moving.
You also may want to consider wearing a particle mask when exercising outdoors, particularly if pollen counts are high.
Put your hat in a plastic bag before you enter your home to keep from bringing all that pollen inside with you.

, Warming up your cardiovascular system for between 5 and 10 minutes not only helps you avoid injury, but also can help decrease your allergy symptoms during your workout.An effective warm-up will get your heart rate up and improve your circulation, which helps move all that mucus and congestion out.
Your warm-up doesn't have to be complex. Five minutes of jumping jacks followed by five minutes of leg stretches, for example, is sufficient if you're going for a run.

, Doctors recommend allergy sufferers fit at least 30 minutes of cardio into their daily routines. Strengthening your cardiovascular system is especially important if you experience significant allergy problems, since you face an increased risk of heart disease.Jogging is an obvious way to get your cardio workout. If the idea of running outside during peak allergy season gets you skittish, consider using a treadmill.
When the treadmill gets boring, there are other options for a good cardio workout, including step machines or bikes.
Aerobics classes also can offer you a good variety to your workout as well as a chance to meet and socialize with like-minded people.
Try not to overdo it, though. Keep in mind that an extreme routine could exacerbate your symptoms or result in exercise-induced breathing problems.
Don’t forget brisk walking as means to rehabilitate the heart while dealing with allergies and exercise routines.

, Strong, deep breath is fundamental to yoga and pilates practice. Even though some poses may be difficult to get through if you have sinus pressure or a runny nose, the breath can ultimately decrease your symptoms.If you do decide to take a yoga or pilates class, focus on the breath above all else. Breathing in through your nose decreases the amount of pollen coming into your body compared to breathing through your mouth.
Do standing poses or sitting poses that keep your head above your heart. Choose a resting pose, such as the lotus pose, that allows you to remain upright.
However, maintaining good breathing may be difficult if your nose is clogged. In these situations, you may want to consider taking an allergy medication an hour to 30 minutes before your class starts.

, Particularly if your symptoms are severe, an aquatic environment may be the ideal workout environment for you. At an indoor pool, the air is humid and warm, which is easier to breathe.If your local gym or fitness center has water aerobics or similar classes at an indoor pool, take advantage of those.
You also can go to a local pool and simply swim laps without having to go to a class or engage in any specific training.
Another way to use the pool is to walk the lanes. You may want to buy aqua shoes and ankle weights, and walk the lanes of the pool. This will lessen the strain on your joints and help you exercise easier. This is a great way for elderly people and people who are obese/overweight to fit in their exercise.

, The steam from a hot shower will help loosen the mucus that's clogging up your sinuses, giving you further relief from your allergy symptoms. If you work out in a gym, take advantage of the steam room.After a hot shower or time in the steam room, stand under cooler water for a few minutes. The temperature change will loosen the mucus in your air ways further and allow you to take some clean, clear breaths.
Showering immediately after exercise also cleanses all the pollen off of your body, especially if you were exercising outside.
Don't skip washing your hair, since pollen can collect there – especially if you use sticky hair products.

, Stretching is important regardless of whether you have allergies, but it's especially important if you want to exercise when dealing with allergies and reduce your most problematic symptoms.Dealing with allergies can leave you fatigued, and feeling stiffer than you normally do. Stretching can help you avoid injury as well as make you feel less achy.
Make sure you're thoroughly warmed up before you do any stretching to avoid potential injury.

, If you don't yet know for sure what's causing your symptoms, you need to find out. An allergist can help find exactly what pollens or other substances cause you problems.When you go to the allergist, ask for a skin-prick test. It will show whether you're allergic to various common allergens.
The allergist may prescribe you a medication to control your symptoms. Even while on medication, you still should take care to assess the environment where you're exercising and limit exposure to triggers.
If you are prescribed an allergy medication, talk to your doctor about your exercise routine. They may prescribe something different based on your activities, or advise you on how long you should wait to exercise after taking your medication.

, Especially if you plan to exercise outside, you can minimize your exposure to allergens by following the weather regularly in the hours leading up to your planned workout. You want to know temperature and humidity, as well as pollen counts.You typically can get accurate, up-to-the-minute forecasts for your general location by checking online at a website such as weather.com.
Generally it's good to exercise outside right after a rain, which tends to decrease the pollen in the air. However, avoid exercising after thunderstorms, which can have the opposite effect.
Humidity between 40 and 60 percent generally is ideal. For outdoor exercise, you'll do best when the humidity is as close to 40 percent as possible.You also want to stay indoors on hot, dry, windy days, when countless pollen is blown through the air and is virtually unavoidable.
Cold weather is a trigger for asthma, so you have to be careful during the winter if you suffer from this condition. If cold weather is a trigger for your asthma, then always cover your face with a scarf or mask.Also, you may want to keep your albuterol handy!

, If you're accustomed to a morning run, you're exercising when pollen counts typically are at their highest, which can exacerbate your symptoms.Mid-afternoons tend to have the lowest pollen counts, so that can be the best time to fit in an outdoor run.
Evenings tend to have lower pollen counts than morning hours, but check the levels locally before heading out.
If your work schedule prevents you from exercising when pollen counts are lowest, you may want to move your workouts indoors during peak allergy season. This is generally during the spring, but will vary depending on where you live and which particular pollens trigger your allergic reaction., Pollen is highest in open fields, especially if it's a windy day. If you're allergic to mold, you'll have more problems near lakes and other bodies of water.If you live near the coast, take your exercise to the beach where pollen counts will be at their lowest.
Other good outdoor spaces include paved tracks, such as the one surrounding the football field at your local high school.

, Even if you're working out at a gym, you can still experience severe allergy symptoms if the air isn't filtered properly or there are a lot of dust mites or other indoor allergens.A controlled environment can enable you to complete your exercise program without suffering significant allergy symptoms. Come early and allow your system to adjust before you warm up and start your routine.
Avoid gyms that have a front door that opens directly outside, as allergens can easily make their way inside.
Make sure that you wipe down the gym equipment before and after you use it to make sure that it is free of germ and allergens.

Get up and move around.,
Exercise your feet and ankles while seated.,
Stretch and move your legs frequently.,
Stop at least once an hour if you're driving.,
Identify factors that put you at increased risk for blood clots.,
Recognize the symptoms of clotting.",How to Exercise to Prevent Blood Clots1," Whether you're traveling by train, plane, or automobile, long-distance travel involves a lot of sitting. When you sit, you decrease circulation in your legs — especially if you sit with your legs crossed or with one foot under you.If you're on a plane, try to get an aisle seat so you can get up and move around more easily.
Ideally, you want to get up and stretch your legs or walk up and down the aisle once every hour or so.
While sitting, keep your feet directly in front of you or stretch them under the seat or into the aisle when you can, rather than crossing your legs.;
, In addition to walking the aisle occasionally, there are exercises you can do to improve circulation in your legs and keep your feet and ankles active without moving around too much or disturbing other passengers.Clinching and widening your toes increases blood flow to your feet, as does circling each foot clockwise and counterclockwise at the ankle.
Press hard on the floor with the balls of your feet, keeping your leg muscles active. This increases blood circulation throughout your leg.
Wear loose-fitting clothing and shoes you can slip on and off while traveling. This will enable you to stretch and move more easily.

, Particularly if you're traveling a long distance, make sure you take breaks to stretch your legs and keep the blood flowing. You can do stretches while seated or by standing in place beside your seat.One exercise you can do in the aisle or while seated is to extend one leg straight out in front of you. Flex your ankle, pulling your toes towards you. Hold this position for a few seconds, then release. Repeat several times, then do the same thing with your other leg.
Pull one knee up towards your chest while seated. Hold it for 15 seconds, then release. Do the same thing with your other leg. Do up to 10 reps at a time to increase circulation to your legs.
Stretch the top of your foot and shin while standing. Cross your left ankle over your right ankle, pointing the toes on your left foot to the right. Bend your right knee and hold for 15 to 30 seconds, then switch.
Open your hips (if you have room) from a seated position. Take your legs wide and place your elbows on your thighs, leaning forward. Gently press forward until you feel the stretch in your thighs. Hold for 10 to 30 seconds.On a plane, check the seat-back magazines and brochures for exercises recommended by the airline.

, You may not think of the potential to get a blood clot while you're in a car, because you have more power over the situation than you do if you're in a plane or other public transportation. But the risk is similar if you're seated for a long period of time.On long-distance road trips, you may feel the pressure to ""make good time"" and reach your destination as quickly as possible.
To prevent blood clots, however, it's important to stop frequently so you can stretch your legs and walk around for a bit to bring the circulation back.
You don't have to make an extended stop. Five minutes at a rest area is sufficient to get the blood flowing again.
Combine your exercise stops with regular road-trip stops to be more efficient. For example, if you have to stop to fuel up, walk around your car while the gas is pumping.

, While anyone can get a blood clot, there are particular factors that increase this risk. People who get blood clots while traveling typically have one or more of these risk factors present:Surgery or injury in the past three months, especially if it results in limited mobility (such as a cast on your leg)
A personal or family history of blood clots
Obesity
Smoking
Over 40 years of age
Hormonal variations, including use of contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, or pregnancy

, Especially if you have an increased risk of developing a blood clot, you need to know what to look for so you can seek treatment immediately before the situation becomes life-threatening.If you notice swelling in a leg or arm, this could indicate you have a blood clot, particularly if only one leg or arm is swollen, but the other appears fine.
Skin around the blood clot may be red, warm to the touch and painful or tender.
Even if there isn't any swelling or redness, if you feel pain in your leg or arm that you can't explain, you might have a blood clot.
If you notice a fast or irregular heartbeat, chest pain, difficulty breathing, or lightheadedness, you may have a pulmonary embolism. Seek medical treatment immediately.

Walk every day to keep active.",How to Exercise to Prevent Blood Clots2," Before your surgery, talk to a fitness professional who has experience working with people recovering from the same type of surgery. They can help you come up with an exercise plan that will best suit your body and your needs.For example, if you've been diagnosed with breast cancer and are having a mastectomy, speak to a physical therapist or certified personal trainer who has worked with breast cancer survivors.
Your doctor should be able to provide a recommendation of experienced and reputable professionals who can help you get your exercise program on the right track after your surgery.
If you already have an exercise routine that you enjoy, feel free to continue it up to the day of your surgery — provided you have the energy to do so.
Have the physical therapist or personal trainer evaluate your existing exercise routine. They can give you advice and show you modifications that will allow you to work the exercises you enjoy into your post-surgery routine.

, The length of time your body will need to heal after surgery will vary depending on the type of surgery you've had. Any average healing time also varies according to your age, overall health, and other personal factors.Maintaining good circulation is essential to preventing blood clots after surgery; however, you typically need at least three or four weeks to recover from any major surgery before you can begin a whole body exercise program.
If your surgery is local to a particular part of your body, you may be able to start exercises that work out other parts of your body while healing.
For example, if you had surgery on one of your legs, you may be able to do upper body strength training exercises.

, After surgery, talk to your doctor or surgeon before you start any exercise program. Even light or moderate exercise can result in complications that interrupt your healing process or put you at even greater risk for blood clots.Describe in detail the exercises you want to do and make sure they won't impede your healing after surgery.
Your doctor also will give you a list of any limitations on your movement following surgery. Some limitations, such as limitations on the amount of weight you can lift, would affect your ability to do strength-training exercises.
Tell your doctor that your goal is to do exercises that will prevent blood clots. They may have additional exercises they can recommend that will help you.

, Stretching exercises often can begin within days after surgery. These exercises are designed to improve circulation, particularly in the area around the surgery, and decrease scar tissue.These stretching exercises typically are centered around the area of your surgery. For example, if you had a mastectomy for breast cancer, you can begin exercising by raising the arm on the same side as your surgery above your head. Open and close your hand 15 to 20 times with your hand over your head. Then bend and straighten your elbow for the same number of repetitions.
This and other exercises are designed to drain lymph fluid, reduce swelling, and increase circulation to the areas of your body affected by the surgery.
Your physical therapist may have a list of daily stretching exercises you're expected to do.
Often physical therapy exercises are boring and repetitive. If you have the ok from your physical therapist, feel free to augment the prescribed stretches with other activities that exercise the same range of motion and you enjoy doing.

, Within a few weeks following your surgery, you should be able to take short, brisk walks. This allows you to return to physical activity gradually and get some cardiovascular exercise that can improve circulation and prevent blood clots.Don't expect to be able to quickly return to the same level of activity you could do before surgery. You're in recovery, and your body is using its energy to heal.
Start with the lowest intensity possible, and gradually work your way up. For example, on your first day walking, you may want to walk for five minutes.
Stay at five minutes until you feel comfortable increasing the duration to six minutes. Increase duration slowly and stay at the same level for several days before increasing the duration or intensity again.
If you have difficulty breathing or feel pain or tightness in your chest, stop immediately.

Perform leg lifts.,
Give yourself time to recover.,
Work with a physical therapist.,
Try swimming.,
Stand at least once an hour and walk at least once every two hours.",How to Exercise to Prevent Blood Clots3," Even when you're recovering from surgery or other treatment for a DVT, it's possible to do leg lifts while lying in bed. Leg lifts will improve the circulation in your leg and help prevent further blood clots.To perform leg lifts in bed, lay on your back with your legs straight out in front of you. Raise your leg a few inches off the bed, breathing deeply as you hold it for a few seconds.
Then lower your leg in a controlled movement — don't simply drop your leg to the bed, but lower it at roughly the same speed as you raised it. Or, if you feel strong enough, lower the leg very very slowly. Just remember to keep breathing — do not hold your breath.
Repeat this exercise 10 to 20 times with each leg. Try to do this exercise three or four times a day.

, Particularly if you've had surgery for your DVT, it's important to give your body adequate time to heal. Even if your DVT was treated without surgery, recognize that you are now at increased risk for another blood clot.If you had surgery, you typically will need several weeks to recover before you can start doing more vigorous exercising.
However, your doctor usually will advise you to do what you can to start being active again as soon as possible.
This typically includes bed rest for about an hour, and then brief walking for a few minutes before returning to bed rest.
Your doctor may give you additional exercises to improve the circulation in your legs.

, If you had surgery for a DVT, a physical therapist will provide you a list of exercises you can safely do that will improve your circulation and help restore your strength and range of motion.Get the physical therapist's approval before you deviate from these exercises.
Keep in mind that exercising too strenuously following a DVT puts you at risk for another blood clot.

, Swimming is a low-impact way to get a full-body workout that improves circulation while also giving you a cardiovascular workout. Even if you don't think you're a strong enough swimmer to swim laps, hanging off the side of the pool and kicking can help improve circulation in your legs.Be careful not to overdo it. The low-impact nature of swimming means you may not realize you're going too hard until the soreness hits the next day.
Get permission from your doctor or physical therapist before you begin a swimming program, even if you only anticipate being in the water for a few minutes a day.

, Even once you're out of the recovery period following a DVT, you're still at increased risk for developing another blood clot. If you are going to be traveling or have a sedentary job, it's important to stay as active as possible.If you're at work, set an alarm or timer to go off each hour. When the alarm goes off, stand up and move around for a few minutes to get the blood moving in your legs.
Every other hour, take a brisk walk around the office or outside. You can also do jumping jacks or jog in place. This will get your heart rate up and improve circulation to prevent blood clots.
Try to stay active throughout the day. This can be difficult if you have a sedentary job, but focus on standing as much as possible.
For example, you might stand or pace while you're talking on the phone, rather than sitting at your desk.

It doesn’t need to be anything substantial – just enough so your stomach doesn’t rumble.A piece of fruit is a great option for a snack after a light workout.;
, Sixty to ninety minutes of working out greatly depletes your energy stores. The most important thing you can do to refill those stores and get your energy back is to eat a snack high in carbs.A piece of toast with nut butter and some fruit or a bowl of cereal with low-fat milk are good options for this type of post-workout snack.

, If your workout focuses on circuit training or includes a lot of weight lifting, you should eat a snack that has equal parts carbs and protein. Because high-intensity training really works your muscles, having carbs and protein will help your muscles recover, which can leave you feeling more energized.Apples with nut butter, chocolate milk, almonds, cottage cheese and fruit, or a hard-boiled egg or two with whole wheat toast are all great ways to make sure you get carbs and protein after your workout.

Rehydrate.,
Stretch as soon as you finish your workout.,
Take a cool shower.",How to Energize Yourself After a Morning Workout2," You should drink water during and as you finish your workout. If your body gets dehydrated, you can start to feel tired. Drinking a bottle of water or some water with lemon in it after your workout gives your body the hydration it needs and can help you feel more energized., Stretching your muscles after your workout prevents them from freezing up or cramping. If your muscles feel tight after your workout, it’s definitely going to decrease your energy. Stretch as soon as your workout is over, while your muscles are still warm.A good basic arm stretch is to place your right arm across your chest, place your left wrist in front of your right wrist and press back. Then swap sides and stretch your left arm the same way.
A good basic leg stretch is to sit with your legs out straight in front of you and stretch forward as far as you can while trying to touch your toes.
You can also sit with your right leg out straight, while bending your left leg at the knee, placing your foot flat on the floor. Twist at the waist until your right elbow is behind your left knee and hold the position for a few seconds. Then repeat the same move on the right side.

, A cool shower after a workout decreases inflammation in muscles. That kind of inflammation can cause pain and discomfort later, and a cool shower can prevent that pain while waking you up.You don’t have to make the water in your shower freezing cold, but it should be considerably cooler than your normal shower.

Eat before your workout.,
Get enough rest the night before.,
Warm up for longer than usual.",How to Energize Yourself After a Morning Workout3," It might seem odd to eat before a workout to feel energized after, but it can work. You know your body best, but some people who eat before a morning workout discover they have more energy during and after the workout.A small shake with some whey protein or a piece of fruit is a great option for a small, pre-workout meal.

, On the nights before you plan to work out in the morning, go to bed earlier than usual. How early you go to bed should correspond to how early you're waking up for your workout. If you stick to this schedule for the days you want to work out in the morning, your body will get used to it and it can become easier.For example, if you normally go to bed at 10 pm and wake up at 7 am but want to fit in a 30-minute work out in the morning, go to bed at 9:30 pm and wake up at 6:30 am instead.

, Your body needs to be warmed up properly before you begin any intense workout. Because your body's temperature is lowest right when you wake up first thing in the morning, you need to make sure you perform a longer warm up than you would if you were working out in the afternoon. You should warm up for about 10 minutes before a morning workout.You can warm up by stretching, walking, and doing jumping jacks without injuring your body.

Start a walking regimen.,
Go swimming.,
Try cycling.,
Leave a day or two between exercise sessions.,
Incorporate aerobic exercise into your daily life.",How to Exercise when You Have Fibromyalgia1," Walking is a simple, low-impact activity that anyone can start doing anywhere. Start slow and stick to a moderate pace – one in which your breathing is slightly heavier but you're still capable of carrying on a conversation.If you've been entirely inactive, try to start walking 10 minutes a day – preferably at an hour when the sun isn't directly overhead and it isn't too hot or too cold out. Treadmills also are a good option because you can control the environment as well as the incline.
Gradually increase the time and distance of your walks. For example, after walking 10 minutes a day for a week, you might start walking 15 minutes a day. The week after that, walk for 20 minutes.
Once you get to the point where you're walking for a half hour or longer, you may want to take a day off between walking days to give your body a chance to recover.;
, If you have access to an indoor pool, swimming can be a great low-impact way for you to exercise when you have fibromyalgia. The water also has a calming effect which may help ease your symptoms.If you don't enjoy swimming laps, you might be able to find a gentle water aerobics class that you can take. Check your local swimming facility to see if they offer water exercise classes to learn safe and effective water exercises.Even if you're not a skilled swimmer, you can get some exercise by holding onto the side of the pool at the shallow end and kicking.
As long as you remain within your comfortable range of motion, you can do many exercises in the water. Try arm or leg circles, or walk across the pool while sweeping your arms.

, Cycling – whether outdoors or inside on a stationary bike – is another low-impact exercise you can enjoy if you have fibromyalgia. Stationary bikes may be better because you can control the resistance more easily than you can on a road or bike trail.If you're starting a cycling regimen for the first time, treat it the same as walking. Only bike for 10 or 15 minutes a day at a low resistance to start. Gradually up the length of time you bike but keep the resistance low. Keep your pace moderate.
Be cautious about adding resistance because you don't want to over-exert yourself, which could lead to flare-ups.

, With the exception of a brief 10- to 15-minute walk, you generally don't want to exercise every day when you have fibromyalgia. Exercising two or three times a week with a day or two in between gives your body adequate time to recover.If you're starting a new program, wait until you're at your baseline – don't start when you're in the middle of a flare-up.
Give yourself as much time as you need to adjust to your new exercise regimen, keeping in mind that during and after exercise you may notice increased discomfort. However, if the pain becomes unbearable you should stop immediately and allow your body to rest.

, One of the nice things about aerobic exercise is that it's fairly easy to build brief spurts of it into your everyday routine without going out of your way to go to the gym or hit the treadmill.For example, when you're out running errands you might park in a spot further away from the entrance so you can walk across the parking lot. You might also consider taking the stairs instead of the elevator if you're only going to the second or third floor.
Modify activities when you need to do so to accommodate chronic pain. For example, instead of chasing or lifting children, you might play with children on the floor or at a table.
Being more active in your daily life will, over time, help reduce your pain and fatigue, enabling you to do more. Just remember to take a rest when you feel you need one and don't overdo it.

Stretch to cool down.,
Practice gentle yoga.,
Learn modifications.,
Try tai chi.,
Take a pilates class.",How to Exercise when You Have Fibromyalgia2," If you have fibromyalgia and want to increase your flexibility, it's better to stretch after you've exercised, when your muscles are fully warmed up. Trying to stretch before exercise can lead to additional pain as well as possibly damaging your muscles.Be gentle with your stretching and don't force the stretch any further than you comfortably can. You want to feel the stretch, but the stretch itself shouldn't hurt.

, Gentle yoga is not as strenuous as other types of yoga, moves more slowly, and ensures that your body is well-supported in every pose. The restorative qualities of gentle yoga as well as its focus on deep breathing and meditation can help ease chronic pain.Many yoga poses also have an energizing effect which can decrease your feelings of fatigue brought on by fibromyalgia.
You should be able to find a gentle yoga class in your area, particularly if you live in a large- to medium-sized city or town. Do a quick internet search with ""gentle yoga"" and the name of the place where you live, or ask at your favorite gym or fitness club.

, Some yoga poses can be difficult for any beginner, but especially for those suffering from a chronic pain condition such as fibromyalgia. However, all poses have modifications that allow you to safely perform the pose without additional pain or difficulty.Props such as yoga blocks, straps, and bolsters can help support you in positions and keep you from having to lean or stretch as far.
Work with a yoga instructor who has experience assisting people with fibromyalgia or other chronic pain conditions, and take it slow. Don't push yourself further than you are comfortable and don't be ashamed to need to use a modification.

, Studies have shown the slow, gentle movements of tai chi can help relieve pain and other symptoms of fibromyalgia. For some, it's even better for increasing flexibility and easing symptoms than stretching or yoga.Look for a tai chi class near you with an instructor who has experience working with people who have fibromyalgia or other chronic pain conditions.
Watch a class before you sign up, so you can get an idea of the movements involved and evaluate whether it's something you think would benefit you. This also gives you an opportunity to talk to the instructor and other class members.

, Like tai chi, studies have shown that pilates can decrease the symptoms of fibromyalgia better than a regimen of relaxation and simple stretches. The practice is designed primarily to build core strength, while also increasing balance and flexibility.Pilates classes can get expensive, so try to find a community class rather than going to a studio, and interview instructors before signing up for a lot of classes. Choose an instructor who has experience working with people who have fibromyalgia or another chronic pain condition.
You also could talk to your health care provider and see if they know of any pilates instructors they would recommend. This can be an easy way to find someone who understands the difficulties you might have with the program.
Don't try to do pilates at home on your own. The program requires a little guidance, especially when you're just starting out, and if you're not using correct form you may end up doing more harm than good.

Use lighter weights.,
Lift slowly.,
Decrease the range of motion in your exercises.,
Pay attention to technique.,
Try fewer repetitions with a heavier weight.,
Pace yourself.,
Stay positive.",How to Exercise when You Have Fibromyalgia3," You can still get a good workout and increase the strength in your muscles, which can help reduce the symptoms of fibromyalgia, if you use lighter weights between one and three pounds.If a one- or two-pound dumbbell is too much for you, start with objects around the house, such as a can of vegetables.
Over time, you can gradually increase the weight, but be careful not to overdo it.
Even with light weights, remember to rest a day or two in between workout sessions, especially if you're strength training.
You can work out different parts of your body on different days to ensure your muscles are getting the rest that they need. For example, you could work on your legs on Monday, your arms on Wednesday, and your core and back on Friday.

, If you're lifting weights, keep your movements slow and precise. This ensures that you're carefully targeting the right muscles to increase strength without over-taxing your cardiovascular system, which can lead to fatigue.Stay in control of both the lifting and lowering of the weight, trying to do both with the same control and at the same speed. Don't simply drop the weight.

, If at all possible, you should try to do strength-training exercises with your full range of motion, as this will build the whole muscle more efficiently. However, if you can't do that without pain, you can always shorten the movement.Make sure the movement you're doing is one you can control. Don't push yourself further if the exercise is causing you excessive pain. Learn to distinguish between fibromyalgia pain and pain coming from the exercise itself.

, For strength-training exercises, using proper form is essential to ensure that you're building muscle properly and not causing undo stress to your joints or surrounding muscles.If you have pain in particular places more than others, you may have the tendency to ""guard"" the muscles where the pain resides by cheating the form on an exercise. In the long run, this will do you more harm than good.
You may want to work out with a trainer, at least at first, to ensure you've got the form down correctly. Once you have muscle memory and know proper technique, you can continue exercising on your own.

, If you do a lot of repetitions with lower weights, your workout will take longer to complete and could result in over-fatigue or flare-up of symptoms. If you're able to lift heavier weights, you can strength train more efficiently.For example, instead of doing two or three sets of 10 to 15 repetitions with a two-pound dumbbell, you might try doing two or three sets of 5 repetitions with a six-pound dumbbell.
Keep in mind that being sore the day after a good workout is normal, and may have nothing to do with your fibromyalgia. You'll have less soreness when your muscles are better conditioned.

, When you have fibromyalgia, the most important thing about any kind of exercise, but particularly strength training, is to ensure that you're allowing your body adequate time to rest and recover after each exercise session.Over-exerting yourself can make your symptoms worse or cause a flare-up.
During your workout, pay attention to your body. If you feel the need to rest, do so. Don't try to push yourself to exercise more when you're feeling fatigued. Even if you need to take a brief rest after every repetition, the exercise you get will still be beneficial.

, Exercising when you have fibromyalgia is making a commitment to your health. While you may have a few flare-ups at first, keep going. Understand that you have made a choice to help yourself. Remind yourself to listen to your body's needs. Stop if you feel too much pain, and avoid comparing yourself to others. You're doing the right thing for you!

Even just one set of a resistance exercise is helpful. Don't be afraid to only take on what you can handle.

Consult your physician.,
Opt for a less vigorous workout.,
Include higher intensity exercises after eating.,
Eat protein on non-fasting days.,
Drink water.,
Have a realistic exercise plan.",How to Exercise During a Fast," You should see your doctor before beginning any exercise routine, but even more so when fasting. Your doctor knows your medical history and can provide guidelines specific to you.


Talk to your doctor about your desire to fast and your exercise plan. They will be able to tell you if this combination is safe and appropriate for you.
If you have any pain or discomfort while exercising or side effects of fasting, discontinue the fast and exercise and call your doctor immediately.
Your doctor's major concern will likely be whether or not your heart is healthy enough for exercise while fasting.
Nutritionist’s recommend not going below 1,200 calories a day when dieting/fasting, especially if you are active.;
, A low-intensity exercise may be more beneficial if you're fasting. This may help ensure that your body doesn't use protein for fuel.During a fast, your body relies on stored energy in the form of glycogen (your body's storage form of glucose). If you haven't eaten in awhile, you may be running low on glycogen which will force your body to use protein as fuel.Choose exercises like walking instead of running. Moderate walking is a low-intensity way to stimulate your heart rate.
Do light yoga or Tai Chi. Slow, deliberate movements not only balance and stimulate the body, these ancient practices have been known to calm and clear the mind.
Garden or do light yard work. They require bending, stretching and lifting, among other body movements. Both are basically exercise disguised as a hobby or a fun chore.
If at any point, even during low-intensity physical activity, you feel lightheaded or dizzy, discontinue the exercise immediately. You may need to drink water and eat a small meal to help you feel better.

, If you're following an intermittent fasting program or a fasting diet for weight loss, you can still include more vigorous intensity exercise.


Ramping up in the intensity or frequency of your exercise program is possible, but it's best to to do this on the days you've eaten.After meals or snacks your body has had the chance to replace its primary fuel of glycogen. You'll also have a more steady supply of glucose in your body from your recently eaten meals or snacks.Some experts recommend only doing your higher intensity workouts immediately after meals to help ensure you have enough fuel (carbohydrates) to last you throughout your workout., If you're following an alternating fasting plan or are trying to lose weight by fasting, it's recommended to eat a higher amount of protein on your non-fasting days.Higher amounts of protein is especially important if you're attempting to build muscle mass. Health experts recommend consuming multiple small, high protein meals every three to four hours.According to the Institute of Medicine, the recommended daily intake of protein should be 46 grams and 56 grams for men and women, respectively. Try and boost your protein intake to the max.
Consuming about 3 – 4 ounces of lean protein will provide you with about 20 – 25 grams of protein., Unless your fast includes abstaining from water, it's essential to avoid dehydration when exercising.


Adequate hydration is important for your body's normal, daily functioning. Generally, most health professionals will recommend you consume anywhere from eight to 13 8-oz glasses (2 to 3 liters) of water daily.Most fasts will allow you to have water (even fasts for medical exams or tests). Make sure to ask or review your fasting plan to see what you can and cannot have as far as hydrating fluids.

, You may want to run instead of walk, or think you can handle heavy weight-lifting, but fasting changes the limits of what your body can normally do.


If you need to fast for a medical exam or a religious observance, plan to include regular low-intensity exercise as you feel able. Once your fast ends, you'll be able to return to your normal activity routine.
If you are fasting from sun-up to sundown, you may want to avoid exercise during those hours. Instead, exercise close to when you can eat in the early morning or in the evening.
If you're fasting for weight loss or other nutrition related goals, you'll need to carefully plan in physical activity. This means understanding you'll need to do more low-intensity exercise on your fasting days and only commit to doing higher intensity exercise on days that you consume more calories.

Try water-based exercises.,
Go for a leisurely bike ride.,
Take a walk.,
Plan to do household chores on your rest days.,
Try a restorative yoga class.,
Sign up for a tai chi class.,
Do simple stretching exercises at home.,
Work on balance and range of motion exercises.,
Write out your exercise schedule.,
Plan low-intensity, low-impact exercises for a short time period.,
Alternate days of high- and low-intensity exercises.,
Pay attention to your body.",How to Exercise Gently on Your Recovery Day," One of the best exercises you can do on your day of rest or recovery are water-based exercises (like water aerobics or swimming). The water of the pool helps alleviate weight from all the joints in your body.


Water exercises are great for recovery due to the buoyancy provided by the water. Studies have shown this can make you feel 90% lighter when you're in water up to your neck.When you're in the pool you can do water walking, swim a few laps or do a intro to water aerobics class. These are all low-impact and also low-intensity. Stick to an activity for about 30 minutes. You don't want to overdo it.
Note that some forms of water exercise are still difficult and shouldn't necessarily be done on your day of recovery. Don't use water weights or paddles that would increase resistance or the difficulty of the exercise.;
, Although cycling in the form of a spin class or intense road biking isn't recommended for a day of recovery, a leisurely and enjoyable ride is. Hop on your bike with friends or family and enjoy a day of recovery on your bike.


Similar to swimming, biking is considered a low-impact exercise. It's very easy on your knees, feet and hips. You're also able to control how fast or slow you go. This makes it a great recovery exercise.Choose a route that's not overly long and doesn't have many hills. This helps keep your bike ride low-intensity while allowing your body to be active.
Also, make sure you're not doing a fast ride. This needs to be slow and leisurely. The goal is to not work up a big sweat or spike your heart rate. Find a route that will take about 30 minutes to do.

, A commonly recommended exercise for recovery is walking. It's a great exercise that's easy to perform, it's fairly low-impact and its very low-intensity.Studies have shown that one of the benefits of walking is that it helps support and strengthen joints (great for recovery). It's through movement that your body circulates joint fluid around your cartilage which brings more oxygen and nutrients to these areas.
To make sure that your walk is comfortable and low-impact, wear supportive walking shoes. Flip flops or slip ons aren't supportive enough. Walking or running sneakers are your best bet.
Choose a route that won't take you a long time and doesn't include a lot of hills. Again, 30 minutes is a great time for recovery days. Take it at a slow pace (instead of power walking) to make sure your exercise stays at a lower intensity.

, Although not an exercise per se, household chores are a great way to stay active. Plan to do housework or chores on your recovery day to keep your body active.


You may not think that household chores are a way to stay active. However, many studies have shown that activities like household chores (called lifestyle activities) have similar benefits to more structured aerobic exercise (like a 30 minute jog).Some lifestyle activities are great for keeping your body moving and active on your rest day. Save some of these common household chores for your rest day to help you stay active.
Chores you can do include: sweeping the floor, mopping, vacuuming, gardening, cleaning the bathroom or mowing the lawn with a push mower.
All of these activities keep you walking and moving but aren't done for long periods of time and do not spike your heart rate very high.

, If you want to follow a more structured class or routine on your recovery day, consider taking a restorative yoga class. This helps your body recovery but also helps relax you mentally.Restorative yoga is similar to a more traditional yoga routine; however, the poses use more supports — like blankets or blocks. In addition, the poses performed are generally designed to bring comfort to the practitioner, not to be difficult.
Studies have shown that restorative yoga provides similar recovery benefits to the body as sleep does.
If you follow a difficult exercise routine during the week, a regular restorative yoga class may beneficial to you long-term. It's truly one of the best recovery day exercises to do.

, Tai chi is another great exercise to include on your weekly recovery day. Like yoga, it's designed to be restorative, but at the same time an active exercise to keep your body moving.

Tai chi is a unique exercise. During class, you move fluidly throughout different poses. It doesn't require a lot of work in regards to straining your muscles or your heart rate.
Studies have shown that there are a variety of recovery benefits to tai chi. Some have shown that practitioners could walk farther and aerobic endurance improved with regular tai chi practice.
Consider including one tai chi session weekly. You can do this on your recovery day to stay active but also to help improve your overall fitness ability.

, Consistent stretching is something you may overlook during your normal weekly exercise routine; however, it's an essential part of a well-balanced exercise plan. Remember that our bodies need to be warmed up, fluids circulating before we stretch. The connective tissues need lubrication and synovial fluid supply to prevent overstretching and tearing.


Take advantage on your rest day to include more stretching. You can spend time thoroughly stretching every muscle group for a little bit longer than what you do during the week.
Stretching is low-impact and low-intensity. You're not really working your body, but you are staying active and moving through different poses. In addition, fitness professionals recommend regular stretching to help prevent injury.Stretching is great to do on your recovery day because it can help relieve muscles soreness and has been shown to improve overall athletic performance.
Work through every muscle group carefully. Do not bounce while stretching — hold the stretch steady. Spend about two to three minutes stretching every major muscle group.

, Another group of exercises that can get overlooked during your regular exercise routine are balance or range of motion exercises. These are also very important to include for a well-balanced weekly routine.With consistent weight training and aerobic exercise, your muscles can become tightened. Without focusing on flexibility and other range of motion exercises, you may become overly tight during the week.
Try including a mix of some balancing and range of motion exercises on your recovery day. Try: arm circles, shoulder rolls, neck rolls and ankle rolls to keep your joints mobile. Also try basic balancing exercises like: standing on one foot or standing on your tiptoes.
Both yoga and tai chi can be considered range of motion and balance exercises as well.

, Including a recovery day in your weekly exercise routine is important. To help you plan the best day to use as a rest day, try writing out and keeping an exercise schedule.


To start keeping an exercise schedule, purchase a journal or a journaling app for your smartphone. You need to be able to take notes and write out your schedule in your journal.
Every week sit down and write up your planned exercise schedule. Write in each exercise you plan on doing, how long it should take and on what day you think you'll do it.
Then, pick out one or two days during your week where you think you'll need a rest and recovery day.
Keep your schedule flexible. You may want to change when your rest day is depending on how you're feeling throughout the week.

, One important concept to keep in mind when planning your rest day is how long you'll be exercising on your days off.


When taking a rest day, it's not only important to choose low-impact and low-intensity exercises, it's also important to focus on how long you're doing these exercises.
Even if you choose an exercise like a leisurely bike ride or walk, if you end up walking or biking for one or two hours, that length of time may not allow your body to truly recover.
Keep recovery exercises short. A 30 minute walk, bike ride or swim is enough time to keep you active, but also allow your body to recover appropriately.

, When you're planning to fit your rest day in your exercise schedule, look for the best days for rest and recovery.


Take a look back over your proposed exercise schedule. Note what days you're planning on doing longer bouts of exercise or more intense or heavy exercises.
It's typically recommended to alternate days of rest after one or two days of more intense or longer exercise sessions.For example, you may want to include a rest day after two days of 4 or 5 mile runs. That way your body, especially your legs, can get a chance to recover after two days of longer runs.

, When planning your rest days and which activities you're going to do, make sure to listen and pay attention to your body's signals. This can help you figure out what you should or shouldn't do.


Without adequate rest, your body will have a hard time continuing to perform well. You may feel more tired, fatigued, have slow recovery of previous injuries or you may notice your overall performance declines over time.These are signals that you need a rest day. If you these symptoms continue or do not improve, this is a sign that you need additional rest.
Whenever you're feeling any of these symptoms, include a rest day immediately. It's not wise to try to push through these symptoms. You'll actually see better results by including a rest day instead of pushing through.

Get a chlorine resistant bathing suit.,
Purchase a cover up.,
Use water shoes.",How to Do Water Aerobics1," Water aerobic classes are usually about an hour, so you want to make sure you have a suit that can deal with hour long classes a few times a week.You can wear a one or a two-piece suit, but a one piece is probably more comfortable. Some gyms might require that you wear a one piece. If you’re taking water aerobic classes at a gym, make sure you find out.;
, You’ll need to walk from where you changed to the pool and back again. A cover up can help you feel a little more comfortable if you’re not used to making that walk in just your bathing suit., A lot of water aerobics courses require you to walk in the pool, or lift your legs, or move in some fashion. Wearing water shoes that grip the bottom of the pool not only prevent you from slipping, they also protect your feet."

Talk to your doctor.,
Sign up for the right class.,
Shower before entering the pool.,
Get ready to move.",How to Do Water Aerobics2," If you have any medical issues, make sure you check with your doctor before you sign up for a water aerobics class.

If you’re unsure which course you should sign up for, ask one of the gym attendants or speak to the instructor., Most gyms require that you shower before you enter the pool. This doesn’t have to mean a full shower, but it you should at least rinse off. This way dirt and body oils don’t get into the pool water.

, Water aerobics instructors will lead you through the moves you need to perform. You should be prepared to move for the entire hour, including a warm up and cool down.You'll be:
Walking and bouncing.

Work your legs.",How to Do Water Aerobics3," Most water aerobic moves use only the resistance of the water to give your body a good workout. For most water aerobic workouts, you'll also need a pool noodle or kick board and some light hand weights., You can work your core in the water by performing underwater lunges. You can hold light weights loosely in your hands when you perform this move to make it a little bit harder.To perform a lunge, stand in waist deep water, with your right foot forward and your thigh parallel to the pool floor. Your left knee should be slightly bent, and your hands should be at your waist. Jump up and switch feet so that your left leg is forward and your right knee is slightly bent.

, Stand with your body underwater up to your shoulders. Let your arms rest at your sides with your hands facing up. Then curl your arms up toward your shoulders in an even motion. It should feel like you're trying to scoop water up and out of the pool.To add extra resistance, you can hold a pool noodle or kick board in your hands as you perform the move. The water will push against the noodle or board, making it harder to lift.

, Being in the pool automatically adds resistance to anything you’ll do with your legs. You can walk or jog the length of the pool, do jumping jacks, or kick underwater.To kick underwater, stand with your legs shoulder-width apart in waist deep water. Kick your right leg up as far as is comfortable and then lower it smoothly back down. Then repeat with the other leg.
You might want to hold on to the side of the pool to keep your balance while you're walking or jogging.

If you don't belong to a gym or don't have a lot of home equipment, the Metaconda workout is great to include in your weekly exercise routine.
You'll need: a yoga mat or a carpeted floor, a stopwatch or timer and one dumbbell.
You might want to have a few sets of different weights so that as you increase your strength, you'll have some heavier dumbbells available.
When you're ready to start the Metaconda workout, set up your dumbbells, timer and mat so that you'll have everything ready and nearby for your workout.;
, If you search for the Metaconda workout online, you'll see there are written versions of it and video versions. You might want to review both so you know exactly how to do this routine.


The Metaconda workout isn't all that hard to follow. However, if you're not familiar with some of the exercises or are a visual learner, you might want to consider watching a video.
There are a variety of videos online of this workout. Some are tutorials that will explain how to do the exercises, while others are just videos of other people performing the workout.Consider watching the entire workout first, so that you're aware of how to do each exercise.
You may also want to have the video play along with you the first few times you do this workout. You can watch it being performed and have the timer on the video help you stick to the timeline.

, If you do some research on the Metaconda workout, you will see that one of the things listed about this routine is that it can be very difficult to perform.


The theory behind the high level of difficulty is that you need to push your limits in order to see serious results.
Many people who start the Metaconda workout will notice that the first few times completing the entire routine will be very difficult.
The creator of this workout urges you not to get discouraged. This routine is meant to be tough. However, after a few times, your body will get more used to this intense routine and you'll notice improvements soon.
Also, after the first time or two, you may be sore afterwards. This is OK and no reason to give up. Stretch, do foam rolling and include rest days to allow your body to cope with this workout.

, To start out with the Metaconda workout, do dumbbell swings. This is a good exercise to start with since it uses many muscles in your body and can help loosen up your muscles and joints.To start this exercise, stand with your feet just slightly wider than hip width apart. Hold a heavy dumbbell in both of your hands.
While keeping your arms straight, squat slightly and swing the dumbbell down in between your legs.
Powerfully push your body up to standing and swing the dumbbell up so that your arms are parallel to the floor. Do not swing the dumbbell all the way up to the ceiling.
Keep your back, shoulders, arms and abs tight and strong. You want to use your muscles to perform this exercise not momentum.
Repeat this exercise as fast as you can for 30 seconds. Rest for a few seconds and then start the next move.

, The blast-off push-up is a variation of a traditional push-up that puts additional stress on your legs, shoulder and abs. It's a great full body move that's specifically great for a strong core.Get down on your hands and knees and move into a standard or traditional push-up position. Your palms should be flat on the floor just a little wider than shoulder width apart.
Perform one push-up by bending your elbows out to the side and lower your body down towards the floor.
Instead of pushing straight back up, push yourself backwards so that your knees bend and your arms are straight and fully extended in front of you.
Then, using your legs, push yourself back into a straight push-up position and lower down again for another push-up.
Repeat this push-up as many times as you can for 30 seconds. Rest for a few seconds and then start the next move.

, After you complete the blast-off push-ups, move onto bodyweight squats. These may feel a bit easier, but when you perform them as fast as you can, they will work your legs at a high intensity.Start these squats by positioning your feet slightly wider than hip width apart. Your toes should be angled away from your body at a 45 degree angle.
Squat down - almost as if you were sitting down in a chair - with your butt pointing backwards.
Squat down until your thighs are parallel to the floor. As you're squatting down, lift your arms straight out in front of you.
Forcefully push yourself back up to standing and drop your arms back down to your sides.
Do as many squats as you can as fast as you can for 30 seconds. Rest for a few seconds and then start the next move.

, For this next exercise, you'll need to grab your dumbbell or kettle bell again. This particular exercise will really focus on your back, shoulders and arms.To start, position your body as if you were going to do squats. Your feet should be slightly farther than shoulder width apart. Hold a dumbbell with both hands in between your legs.
Bend your knees slightly and lean your upper body forward at the hips. Allow the dumbbell to fall in between your legs in front of you.
Pull the dumbbell towards your chest as forcefully as you can. Stop when the dumbbell meets your chest.
Push the dumbbell back out in front of you until your arms are completely straight again.
Repeat this exercise as fast as you can for 30 seconds. Rest for a few seconds and then start the next move.

, Mountain climbers are a great exercise since they strengthen your muscles but also increase your heart rate.Get down on the floor almost as if you were going to do a push-up. Your palms should be flat on the floor about shoulder width apart. Your legs should be extended back behind you.
As quickly as you can while keep your upper body and arms stationary, pull your knees up to your chest.
Alternate between both of your legs. It should almost look like you're running in place.
Repeat this exercise as fast as you can for 30 seconds. Rest for a few seconds and then start the next move.

, Although the hollow body hold specifically targets your abs, this exercise will strengthen your entire core including your back, abs and glutes.To start this exercise, lay on the floor with the front of your body facing upwards towards the ceiling.
Lift your head and shoulders off the floor and swing your arms above your head and keep them straight.
Squeezing your abs, lift your legs off the ground so your feet are about a foot off the ground. Press your legs together. Your body should form a ""U"" shape.
Hold steady in this position for 30 seconds. Rest for a few seconds and then start the next move.

, Although there are only 6 exercises included in the Metaconda workout, the routine is repeated 8 times. In addition, the period of rest in between these exercises changes with each round.In order to complete the entire Metaconda workout completely, you need to complete each round (a total of 6 exercises) 8 times.
If you can't complete the full 8 rounds initially that's OK. Try to complete each round as many times as you can. Over time, you'll be able to do the full 8 rounds.
In between each exercise there is a period of rest. During round 1, you can rest for 30 seconds between each exercise and in-between the first and second round.
However, with each completed round you need to decrease the amount of rest between exercises by 5 seconds.
For example, since the first round allows for a 30 second rest, the second round will only have a 25 second rest between exercises and the third round will only have 20 seconds of rest between exercise. The last set will have no rest between exercises.

, When you're starting the Metaconda workout, you'll need to figure out when you're going to do it during the week. Schedule this into your weekly exercise routine so you'll stay on track.The Metaconda workout is both cardio and strength training, however most heavy on the strength training component. When you're scheduling this into your routine, count this as a resistance or strength training workout.
Write out your exercise schedule each week or for the entire month. Write in which days you're doing cardio, strength or which days you'll be doing the Metaconda workout.

, Since the Metaconda workout focuses primarily on strength training, it'd be a good idea to also include some steady-state cardiovascular exercise as well.


Health professionals recommend that you include about 150 minutes of steady-state cardio or aerobic exercise each week.Steady-state exercises are aerobic activities that keep your heart rate elevated and you do the exercises for at least 10 minutes at a steady state or intensity. However, you need to work out for at least 30 minutes at a moderate intensity to burn fat.
Try to work out at an intensity that is equal to about 70 or 75% or your heart rate maximum. A sustained 60 to 80% heart rate maximum is considered the cardio training zone.
Exercises you can do include: walking, jogging, cycling, swimming, taking an aerobics class or using the elliptical.

, The Metaconda workout is a great routine to include to help change up your typical strength training routine. However, if you want to, you can also include other forms of strength training as well.


Health professionals recommend that you include one to two days of strength training exercises each week.These exercises need to be done for at least 20 minutes and focus on every major muscle group in your body. The Metaconda workout meets all of these guidelines.
In addition to the Metaconda workout, you can also use weight machines, lift free weights, do other body weight exercises or try out a yoga or pilates class. These all count as strength training exercises.

, The Metaconda workout will really help build muscle mass, decrease body fat and strengthen your entire body. However, without adequate rest, you will not see these results.


Every fitness and health professional recommend that you include at least one rest day each week.It's during rest that your muscles perform a significant amount of recovery and repair activities. They will heal and grow in size and strength during rest.
Since the Metaconda workout is high intensity and high impact, you should include a rest day after performing this routine.
You can do something gentle or easy like walking or an easy swim class, but try to keep it low intensity and low impact for the best benefit.

Let your palms sit flat on the mat, putting equal weight into your palms and your forearms.You can also interlace your fingers when you are on your forearms if this feels more stable and comfortable for you.
Beginning on your forearms can give you more stability and control in plank position and when doing spiderman planks. This may be a good option if you are new to plank position or have a shoulder injury you do not want to irritate.

, Inhale as you lift your knees up and extend your legs back behind you. Place your toes on the mat and make sure you have equal weight in your hands or forearms and in your legs. Activate your core by tightening your abdominal and gluteal muscles, as well as your lower back.Keep your body in a straight line from head to toe, making sure your hips are level with your shoulders and your head facing forward.

Meet with your doctor during a regular check up or give them a call. Talk to them about your arthritis and desire to take a Zumba class.
If you haven't seen your physician in a while, talk about how well managed your arthritis symptoms are, when and where you have pain and how long it lasts. This may help your doctor determine whether or not Zumba is appropriate for you.
When you first start with an exercise routine like Zumba, you may notice some initial pain, stiffness or achiness during or after a class.Talk to your doctor about how to manage these temporary symptoms.;
, Since Zumba has gotten so popular, there are now a variety of types and styles of Zumba classes. Taking ones that are designed for your specific needs can help you enjoy the class and prevent injury or pain.


If you are not currently active or have more joint pain, consider trying Zumba Gold. This is a specialty Zumba class that is geared towards older adults, those with joint pain or limited range of motion and those who need a low impact and low intensity class.Aqua Zumba is another great version of this exciting exercise. Done in the pool, this low impact exercise can help work up a sweat but without all the pain in your joints.However, a general Zumba class will fit a variety of fitness needs. If you are already slightly active or don't have a lot of joint pain, you should consider trying this regular Zumba class.
Whether you choose regular Zumba or Zumba Gold, you can bring up or take down the intensity of the class by doing alternative moves and exercises.

, Zumba is a great class for exercise. It's fun and exciting and can keep you motivated to continue being active. However, it can be a little intimidating to start out, so take time to chat with the instructor.


If you've signed up for a Zumba class, get to class about 10 to 15 minutes early. This will give you time to chat with the instructor, get the layout of the room and choose a spot to do your exercise.
If you're taking a regular Zumba class, talk to the instructor about modifying certain poses to accommodate your joint pain and stiffness.
Even if you do take the Zumba Gold class, still talk to the instructor about the level of exercise of the class. You may be able to follow along without a problem or even be able to modify exercises to make them a little more difficult.

, Like all types of exercise, it's important to wear the appropriate type of clothing. It'll help you feel comfortable in the class and allow you to perform exercises easily.


First, find exercise clothes that are movable and not restrictive in any way. Zumba classes do a lot of movements and to do them correctly, they should be done in a fluid motion. This also helps prevent joint pain.In addition, find clothes that are breathable and wick sweat away from your body. Even if you're taking the Zumba Gold class, you'll still work up a sweat.
You'll also need to wear a pair of supportive exercise sneakers or cross trainers. A correct shoe does a lot to help prevent excessive joint pain or stiffness.

, Like many types of exercise, Zumba classes will help you work up a sweat. Make sure you bring the appropriate items with you (like a water bottle).


Make sure to bring at least a 16 oz water bottle filled with cold water or a low calorie sports drink. Zumba classes are generally 45 to 60 minutes long, so you'll need to refresh with a beverage.Also consider bringing an exercise towel. You might work up a good sweat and need to towel off a bit in between songs.
If you need a knee or ankle brace or wrap, make sure to bring those items with you. You'll need to put those on right before you start your class.

, When you're starting a new fitness routine with a condition like arthritis, it's important to ease into it. If you overdo it, you can injure yourself or cause more pain.


Health professionals recommend only doing Zumba one to two times a week to start with.
If you have difficulty getting down the steps and rhythm, you might consider going twice a week to help you learn the choreography.Also, if you feel like you cannot do the whole 45 or 60 minutes, let the instructor know ahead of time that you'll be slipping out after 30 minutes or whatever amount you can do.

, Strength training exercises are especially important for those dealing with arthritis. Make sure to include a few days weekly of these exercises in addition to your Zumba classes.


Strength training helps build and maintain lean muscle mass. Muscles help absorb the shock of certain movements - like walking - and can help alleviate the associated pain.Health professionals recommend that adults, even those with arthritis, aim for one to two days of strength training exercises each week. You should exercise for about 20 minutes and work each major muscle group.Most strength training exercises are appropriate for those with arthritis. However, ask your physician before doing above the shoulder exercises or using the leg press machine., In addition to strength and Zumba classes, health professionals also recommend those with arthritis include a few days of balance training.Those with arthritis may be at increased risk of falling due to the stiffness and pain in their joints. Improving your balance can help prevent this.
Tai chi or yoga are exercises that can be adapted easily for those suffering with arthritis. They help improve strength, flexibility and improve balance.
In addition, you can try standing on one leg for a few seconds and then alternating sides. Do this daily to help improve your balance.

, Flexibility, stretching and range of motion exercises are also very important to include for those with arthritis. If you don't work on improving your range of motion, you may experience increased pain and other symptoms.Loss of range of motion is associated with increased pain and loss of joint function, physical limitations and increased risk of injuries and falls.
Regular stretching and range of motion exercises is generally recommended. You can do these most days of the week without increasing injury risk.
Do not simply stretch without guidance. Joints that are affected by arthritis are easily overstretched and vulnerable to injury. Always talk to your doctor about what stretches are appropriate for you.

, Zumba is a great cardiovascular class to take. However, if you can't get to a Zumba class regularly or want to incorporate other types of aerobic activities, you can try:


Water aerobics. This water and swimming based class is a great exercise for those suffering from arthritis. It's low impact and the water helps prevent excess pounding on your joints.Using a stationary or recumbent bike. Both a stationary and recumbent bike are good for those with arthritis - especially in your knees. It's a low impact exercise that can help strengthen your knees and give you a great cardio workout.Walking more regularly. Walking is a great exercise for those with arthritis. Overtime it can actually improve and lessen joint pain and improve other symptoms., Arthritis can make following an exercise routine more difficult. When you first start, you may notice more pain.However, be patient with yourself as you embark on improving your health and fitness.


When you have arthritis, being more active can help to reduce the amount of pain you have. It can also improve your range of motion and balance.Give your body time to get used to Zumba. You may be moving and activating muscles that you haven't used in a while. Being a little sore is normal.
Don't give up after one class. Even if your joints were a little achy or sore, that's OK. Keep trying - the more you do it, the easier it gets.

, Pain is common and to be expected in your joints when you have arthritis. Some days, your pain level will determine how much exercise you do or the intensity.Change the part of the body you're working. Switch exercises based on what part of your body is aching or in pain. For example, if your knees are sore and achy, consider doing water aerobics instead of walking.
Change the intensity of the exercise if you're feeling some pain or fatigue. If you normally do Zumba at a regular intensity, consider taking it down a notch or modifying moves to help reduce pain.

, If you have arthritis, wearing some supports around certain joints can help alleviate pain. In addition, these supports may help you be able to participate in more activity.Consider wearing a supportive brace. You'll most likely need either an ankle or knee brace for Zumba classes.
If you just need a little support, consider using a wrap or bandage around your knees or ankles.

, With any type of exercise, it's important to know when your body has had enough. Make sure to stop exercising when you're at risk for injuring yourself.


Some exercises, including Zumba, may cause you too much pain or discomfort. If this is the case, you'll need to stop or give yourself a break for a few days.
If you consistently need to take pain relievers to deal with the pain felt during or after exercise, that's a sign you need to take it down a notch.If you have injured yourself or had a flare up in a joint, make sure to give yourself adequate time to recover before starting back with your Zumba class.

, Wear comfortable shoes, but nothing special. Get your entire system pumping and blood rushing, but not to much. (Upgrades: speed walk, or jog, or jog in place)

, (Upgrade: wear heavy boots or use ankle weights.)

, Keep your back straight, place your palms on the wall, slowly lean in and count to three, push back, count to three. (Upgrade: slightly farther from the wall, feet spaced wider, or closer.)

, Stand with the chair securely behind you, perhaps against a desk so it will not roll-out from under you, feet shoulder-width apart. Have arms straight out in front of yourself. Slowly lower yourself into a seated position, sit for a count of three, then stand up slowly. Repeat. (Upgrade: Rise onto tiptoes for a variation!)

, Bend and turn at the waist while reaching one hand toward the opposite foot and the other toward the ceiling. Return to your standing position -- alternate from side to side; repeat. (Upgrade: Mix squat chair with touch toe; so sit, rise then touch toe; then repeat...)

Public lakes, rivers, and ponds are usually your best bet. Talk to other fishermen at your local sporting goods store to get some tips on locations for fishing.


Many local municipal parks stock fish in ponds that are available for anyone to fish, and the fishing is usually pretty easy and quick for the beginner, though these are often crowded and somewhat dirty. Never crowd other fishermen and encroach on ""their spot.""
Secluded spots around ponds or levees outside of town are good bets. If you're wandering in the woods looking for a place to fish privately, make sure you're not tramping onto someone's private property, or that you're fishing in a place that doesn't allow it.
If you live on the coast, ocean fishing is an available option. You'll need a separate license for ocean fishing, and gear specific to the kinds of fish you'll be catching in the ocean. The techniques are largely the same.;
, Many newspapers have local fishing reports that will list locations and tell you what fish, if any, are biting and what they’re biting on. You can also ask around at angling shops, marinas and camping supply stores in the area for tips.


Catfish are common river and lake fish all over the United States. Channel catfish, blue catfish, and flathead catfish are all commonly caught for eating. Look for deep water at the mouth of large creeks and rivers, and keep an eye out for sudden cut banks or drops. Catfish love these spots, but will head out to deeper water when it warms., Want to catch alligator gar but you live in New York? It's going to be tough going if you're casting into the East River. If you want to be ambitious and plan a fishing trip to net a particular variety of fish, you'll have to make a trip to the region and the particular type of water that fish inhabits.


In the Great Lakes region, walleye are quite popular, as well as Northern Pikes. Lake Huron is a popular spot for fishing these often-large catches.






In the South, gar and bowfins are common in swampy regions. Flounder and perch are also commonly fished. The Henderson swamp in Baton Rouge is a great spot for Gar, and Lake Pontchartrain is a fishing destination for all sorts of varieties.
In the Northwest, rainbow trout are well stocked and common, distinctive for their reddish or pinkish stripe from the gill to the tail.Crappie, walleye, and bass are also common in this region.






If you've picked a body of water you like and want to find out what kind of fish are around, throw in some food scraps and wait a few minutes.

, Most fish big enough to catch will spend most of the day in deeper water and come into the shallows to feed. They won't spend much time swimming around shallow water, however, so you'll want to find the places they'll come up for quick food sorties before darting away.


Look for reedy and log-filled beds in lakes that are close to sudden drop offs. Bugs generally congregate in cutbanks and tiny inlets, as well, making them popular feeding grounds for fish. Mussel beds are popular catfish hangouts.

, Most freshwater fish are crepuscular feeders, which means they come out to eat at dawn and at dusk, making sunrise and sunset the most effective fishing hours.


If you're an early riser, get out there before the sun's up to enjoy a morning fishing session. If the thought of setting your alarm clock for 4:30 gives you the willies, aim for an early evening fishing plan.

, Check your State's Department of Natural Resources website, or call and talk to someone at the park office for information about the cleanliness of the water and whether or not its safe to eat the fish you're planning on catching. If you don't want to eat them, simply release them back into the water.

, Visit the website of the state's Department of Fish and Wildlife or the Department of Natural Resources in which you're planning to fish and obtain a fishing license for information. Typically, there's a fee in the neighborhood of $40 for a resident and twice as much for a non-resident of the state. You'll need to get a license for each state in which you catch fish and can typically do this online, though you might need to visit the office in person in some states.


Usually, you can obtain a short-term permit to fish if you don't want one for a whole season and want to save a little bit of money. If you live in the area, though, it's usually more cost-effective to buy the full season license.
In many states, kids under the age of 16 don't need a license to fish. Check the laws in your area to be sure.
Most states will designate a handful of free fishing days on which anyone can fish, with or without a license. Typically, though, you'll still need to get a note of permission from the DNR.

, Going to the sporting goods store can be an intimidating experience, but you don't need to break the bank to pick an appropriate rod and reel to get started with. Talk to the guy behind the counter for advice on a rod and pick something in your price range.


Typically, a medium-length pole will be appropriate for most beginners. Pick a rod that's roughly as long as you are tall and that's a comfortable weight for your casting arm. In terms of flexibility, you'll probably want a fairly ""loose"" (that is, not rigid) rod to get started with. These rods are less likely to break line and--while not strong enough to fish for big game fish--are plenty strong for the average fish a beginner catches.
The two basic kinds of reels are baitcast reels, which spool vertically when you're holding the rod, and spinning reels, which spool perpendicular to the rod. Spinning reels are more common for the beginner, and are available in open and closed varieties. Closed varieties are generally operated with a push-button and are great for the beginner.







, The smaller the hook and line, the better the chance of a bite. You want to match the kind of line to the type of pole you've got--if you've got a particularly rigid pole, you'll want fairly strong test line. If you've got a looser pole, get the lightest gauge you can. Smaller line means more fish.


You need hooks that will fit the kind of fish you're planning to catch. Number 1 hooks work well for many things, but size 8 to 5/0 are more appropriate for some fish. Ask your local tackle shop about the hook sizing system (i.e. 6,4,2,1,1/0, 2/0) and the best tools for the job.
Making a hook knot is difficult with small hooks and line and can be tricky to get the hang of. Ask a tackle shop owner or your fishing buddy to teach you.

, Synthetic baits like Power Bait are made to resemble and smell like live bait, and pro shops are filled with all manner of elaborate and iridescent plastic lures. But because fish eat insects and aquatic life, there are also lots of effective live baits to choose from if you want a more authentic fishing experience.


You can either purchase live bait at the local angling shop, or you can gather your own. Many anglers gather worms in a lawn after a rain or late at night with a flashlight. You can find grasshoppers along the banks of a stream, or try catching minnows with a net and bread crumbs or a minnow trap. Keep them in a bucket full of water and keep them alive for as long as possible.
Each fisherman has a favorite bait, but the old standard are tough to beat. Consider using:
worms
salmon eggs
grasshoppers
shrimp
liver
bacon
cheese

, If you're planning on keeping your fish, you'll want to get a fish cage to keep the fish trapped in water, or a simple bucket to throw them in while you continue fishing. A net is also useful for getting the fish wrangled before you try to grab it off the line.


If you're going fishing in a boat, bring the necessary gear to be on the water. Life vests and a boating license are required. If you're going to be on shore, you might want to bring a lawn chair and some waders to keep your feed dry.

, In fly fishing, tying the right knot is half of the sport. For the beginner, however, learning a simple clinch knot is the best way to get started. To do a clinch knot:


Thread the end of the line through your hook, then wrap it 4-6 times around itself, going back toward the reel.






Feed the end of the line back through the loop and pull it tight. You might need to use a little spit on the line to lubricate it and make sure it pulls tight.







, If the water is quite swift, as in a river or stream, it is probably best to attach weights (sinkers) to your line about 12"" above your bait. By weighting down your line you will keep your bait in place an inch or a few inches above the floor of the water—right where fish are likely to be hunting.


For beginners, using a larger bobber that you can see from the bank makes catching fish much easier. With a bobber, the angler will be able to see a strike from a fish when the bobber starts to jerk and disappear below the surface of the water. Put on just enough shot (sinkers), however, to compensate for the larger bobber to prevent being too hard to see the action of the biting fish.

, While it depends on the kind of bait you're using, in general, you'll want to work the hook through your bait as many times as possible to keep it securely on the hook. Holding the hook securely in one hand, start 1/3 of the way from the bottom of the bait, and push it straight through. Bend the bait back toward the hook and pierce the bait again about halfway. At least two or three secured piercings should be fine.


There's no denying its kind of gross to jam a hook through a worm three times, but you want to make sure the worm stays on and can't wriggle free when you cast.

, Most beginners will cast side arm, using the same motion used to skip a stone across the water. Bring the rod back to your side and bring it smoothly in the direction you'd like to cast, releasing the line as you point in the right direction.


Releasing the line depends somewhat on the type of reel you're using, but if you've got a closed push-button spinner reel, the job is fairly straight forward. Pushing the button releases the line and letting go stops it. When you cock the rod back, push the button, and when you point it, release it.

, Some fishermen will start reeling in very slowly, lightly jerking the bait to give fish the impression that it is alive. Depending on your experience and your bait, you might do this, or you might just sit back and wait. Experiment with different methods until you get a bite. Do not immediately start reeling back in as soon as you've cast, however.


Fish are startled by loud noises and thrashing, so turn down the radio and keep the chatter to a low rumble. You'll anger other fishermen who might be nearby trying to catch fish, and you'll ruin your progress.
You can tell if a fish is biting by touch, by watching a loose line or a bobber, or by attaching a bell to the end of your rod. Make sure with a slow movement of the rod that there is no more slack in the line when you try to hook the fish.
If you wait for 10-15 minutes and you still haven’t gotten a bite, try casting somewhere else and wait again.

, Once you feel a tug on the line or feel the line start to be taken, you will want to ""set"" your hook. To do this, simply give your fishing rod (and consequently the fishing line) a quick and firm jerk backward and up. If you have a fish on line, it will fight back immediately and your line will follow the movements of the fish.


It can sometimes be difficult to tell if you have a bite or if you’re just feeling the current or a fish bumping into the bait. Only practice can help you get a feel for it.

, Don't use the reel to pull in the fish, except for very small fish. Keep the line tight and use your arms to pull it toward you, then reel in the slack line.


More fish are lost to loose lines than anything else. A loose line provides an opportunity for your fish to ""throw the hook"" right out of it's mouth. By keeping tension on the line you will ensure that the hook remains in the mouth of the fish.
All modern reels have an adjustable drag but nylon lines drag can be adjusted by pulling with the hand. If you feel the nylon stretching, the drag should begin to work. Even very big fish get tired when pulling against a constant line pressure. Try to use the rod to steer the fish to open water.

, When you've got the fish tired out and reeled in, bring it out of the water and have a partner catch it in your fishing net, or carefully catch it yourself. Be wary of the fish's sharp spines and the hook, which might be sticking out through the fish's mouth.

, If you're considering keeping the fish for eating, you'll need to make sure it's big enough to be taken and that it's not a protected species of fish. Get hold of the fish by moving your hand from head toward the tail without getting lanced by its fins. If you move your hand against the grain, you'll get speared.


You might consider bringing along an identification guide if you're planning on keeping any fish, as well as checking with the DNR regarding particular size limitations for the variety.

, Regardless of keeping or releasing the fish, gently back the hook out, so that it comes out the way it came in. There are special tools designed for taking hooks out, although needle nosed pliers work quite effectively.


You can also use the needle nosed pliers to crush the barb on your hook, to make it easier to remove. Some professionals recommend doing this before casting your line out (especially when fishing for catfish), to make it easier to release your catch. It truly works best with circle/octopus circle type hooks. These hooks make it easier to set the hook in the lip/corner of the fish's mouth; without much effort on your part.







, If the fish is too small, or you're just catching for fun, take a quick picture to commemorate your catch and toss it back gently into the water. If you are going to cook the fish, you may want to consider cleaning the fish at this point, or keeping it alive in an underwater cage for the purpose and cleaning it later.

Look for reinforced patches.,
Make sure the gaiters are on the right foot.,
Wrap and zip up the gaiters.,
Tighten the gaiters.,
Slide on the bottom strap.",How to Wear Gaiters," Gaiters usually come in either an ankle or full length style. Ankle gaiters will cover your shoe and the bottom of your pants. They are usually best for keeping grit and debris out of your shoes. Full length gaiters are the most common. They keep snow, water, and debris out of your shoes and protect you from things like thorns and snake bites.Ankle gaiters are good for off road and fell runners because they are closer fitting than full length gaiters and protect you from water ingress.;
, Gaiters come in many sizes. Usually, you will need a pair of gaiters that correspond with your shoe size. Along with shoe size, they should also fit snugly around your calf. If possible, it’s best to try on gaiters at a store to make sure they fit you properly., The cheapest gaiters will usually come with Velcro as a fastener. A majority of gaiters have lace hooks that can adjusted to fit your leg and shoe. Higher end gaiters often have waterproof zips or click-lock buckles. Costly brands are usually more reliable, but you don’t have to buy the most expensive brand of gaiters to get the protection you need. , Your gaiters will come with one way to attach the bottom of the hooks to your boots or shoelaces. Hooks are very common. Slide the hook under the lace of the boot. Try to get the hook to catch as far down as possible.Mid-length hooks that face out are the easiest to use.

, Your gaiters may not come with a hook. If that’s the case, look for straps the ends of your gaiters. The straps should be in a “U” shape. Buckle the straps on the outsides of your feet., Don’t stress if you don’t see hooks or straps. That means your gaiters probably have reinforced patches—like Velcro. The patches will usually be located on the shins or insteps. There should be two patches that need to be attached to each other to secure the gaiters., There should be a gaiter specifically for the right and left foot. You should be able to tell by the design of the gaiters, or there may be a marking. You will know the gaiters are on the right foot if the underfoot straps are on the outsides of your feet., If you have full length gaiters, wrap them around your ankles and calves. Wrap them around your ankle if they are shorter than full length. Hook the gaiters all the way down your leg if you have hooks. Zip the gaiters if you have zippers., There should be a strap at the bottom of your gaiters. Tighten the straps as much as you can. To secure the strap, you will most likely need to pull the strap through a buckle. Make the gaiters tight enough so that snow or debris doesn’t have a way to fall in. Don’t make them too tight, however, or you could cut off your circulation.You will also have to tighten the calf enclosure if you have full length gaiters. The enclosure may be a string you have to pull on or straps you have to buckle.

, You should have a strap left undone on each gaiter. Put the straps under the bottom of each foot. The straps should be under the middle of your shoes. Thread the straps through the buckles, tighten the buckles, and then you’re good to go.Make sure there aren’t any gaps left in your gaiters before going outside.

Choose the exercises you want to incorporate.HICT can encompass a variety of exercises.,
Select the intensity of the workout.HICT workouts, by definition, are high-intensity.,
Think about how long you want to do each exercise.You can do a given exercise between 30 and 60 seconds.,
Decide how many times you want to repeat the circuit.A circuit is usually quite brief, lasting five to 10 minutes.,
Decide how often you want to try the circuit.Most people add one HICT workout to their routine per week.",How to Do High Intensity Circuit Training1," The important thing to consider is how quickly you can move from one exercise to the other. If you’re at home, you probably can’t quickly move from lifting weights to swimming or riding a bike (unless you have a stationary bike). If you’re at a gym, your options are more diverse. You should choose a balance of resistance training and aerobic exercise.


Resistance training includes lifting weights, squats, arm raises, pull-ups, and other exercises that primarily burn fat and strengthen bones.
Aerobic (or cardio) exercises primarily gets the heart pumping. These exercises include running, biking, and swimming, among others.
Your exercises should also work a variety of muscle groups.Choose exercises that work your lower body, upper body, core, and total body in equal amounts.
Make sure that when you organize your circuit you are alternating between major muscle groups. If you do pushups, for instance, your next exercise should not engage the same muscles — try doing squats instead to engage your lower body.;
, But how intense do you want to get? Do you want to operate at 70%, 80%, or 90% of your maximum ability? While these values are subjective, it is important to be aware of and think about your own physical limitations, and select an intensity level that pushes you to work hard, but within your range of capabilities.


One way to estimate your own intensity levels is the “talk test.” To perform the talk test, try holding a conversation while performing an exercise on your circuit. If you’re performing at about 80% of your heart rate’s maximum, you should find it hard or very hard to hold a conversation and you should notice shortness of breath or heavy breathing. You should be perspiring.
Avoid operating at 100% of your physical ability. You shouldn’t risk collapse and/or injury due to the intensity of your exercise.

, With some exercises (pull-ups, for example), it’s best to just do as many reps as possible, since the number of each exercise you’re able to do changes as you move through the circuit.


For instance, the first time you do your circuit, you might have no problem doing 15 or 16 pull-ups at a high intensity. By the time you’ve cycled through all your exercises and arrived at the pull-up bar again, however, you might only have the stamina for 10 or 12 pull-ups.
After choosing how long to perform each exercise, choose how long you want to rest.
The typical HICT workout recommends 30 seconds to two minutes per exercise (some exercises, like burpees, take longer to execute), followed by 10 seconds of rest or stretching before heading into the next exercise.

, In order to get a full workout, you’ll need to repeat the circuit at least once. A circuit that is well thought-out should get repeated three or four times.

, As you become more capable of enduring HICT workouts, you might add a second or third.


Do not do more than two HICT workouts each week. That way, you’ll have time to recover between HICT sessions. Remember, the heart is a muscle too, and needs time to recover. Any high-intensity workout should be performed only twice a week unless you are an athlete.

Establish your base fitness level.Your base fitness level is the level of physical fitness you achieve after several weeks of exercising at a normal rate in 20- to 60-minute intervals, three to five times per week.,
Assume proper form.Some people have a hard time doing their exercises properly when pushed to do them at high-intensity.,
Consult a physician.,
Do a warmup and cooldown.A warm-up should work your legs, arms, shoulders, back, and neck.,
Consult a trainer.Trainers — also known as personal trainers or fitness trainers — are professionals with an in-depth understanding of exercise routines.",How to Do High Intensity Circuit Training2," If you're new to high-intensity exercise, you’ll need to exercise for several weeks so that your muscles can develop and your body can begin to transport oxygen to the muscles more efficiently. Once you’ve achieved this, you’ll be able to exercise more comfortably over longer periods of time. At this point, HICT can be used to add variety and fun to your routine.

, But it’s important not to get sloppy during your HICT exercises. Never sacrifice proper form to achieve greater speed. Doing so will increase your risk of injury.


Use exercises you have already mastered. For instance, if you really struggle with regular lunges, don't put them on the HICT slate. Choose exercises that you normally find easy. It is the rapid cycling through a variety of exercises that should be the challenge, not the performance of any one of the exercises in the sequence.

, HICT is not appropriate for everyone, and you should talk with your doctor before you begin. If you have an injury or an advanced illness, HICT may not be right for you. Certain medications may affect your physical performance or the level of intensity you are able to achieve. Remember to exercise in a way that works for you and is safe.

, An easy way to warm up the legs is to simply walk for five minutes or so. Move the neck by looking up and down five times. Work your arms by waving them clockwise in concentric circles five times, then waving them counterclockwise five times.


After your exercise is completed, do a cooldown. Keep moving around to allow your heart rate to lower gradually and prevent blood from pooling.

, They can explain how each machine or station in the gym works, and will help you get the most out of your workout routine. Most importantly, fitness trainers can help you correct your form and look for other ways to improve your safety during HICT.


Personal trainers are available at almost every gym.
You will probably need to pay a small fee to receive lessons and assistance from a trainer.

A simple online search will help. Just enter a word string like “HICT routine” into your search engine of choice.


Remember, you don’t need to strictly follow the pre-written workouts. Use them for inspiration. Extend or shorten the duration and intensity of each exercise to suit your needs.

, Since it’s important to time yourself during the workout, you should definitely have a clock visible nearby. You could also choose to use a stopwatch programmed to beep in alternating 30-second and 10-second intervals. This way, you’ll know exactly when to end one part of the exercise and move on to the next.

, Each exercise in this sample HICT workout lasts for 30 seconds. Rest after completing one full circuit.


Start with 30 seconds of jumping jacks.
Do a held wall sit (an exercise in which you lean back against a wall and slide down to achieve a 90-degree angle at your knees before rising again).
Next, do a rapid series of pushups.
Finish with 30 seconds of crunches.
Rest, then repeat the circuit one to three more times.

, Another HICT workout might look something like:


Do a simple step-up (an exercise where you step up onto a chair, then off again).
Next, try a tricep dip. Lean your hands against a chair positioned behind you and let your fingers hang over the edge of the seat. (You could use a coffee table or low stool if you don’t have a sturdy chair.)
After resting, head into a series of squats, an exercise in which you bend your knees from a standing position as if you’re sitting down, but remain standing. Lower your butt to a place just slightly lower than your knees.
End the circuit with a plank. This exercise will work your core. Assume a pushup position, but lean against your forearm rather than your hands. Keep your neck and spine straight. Rest.
Rest and then repeat the circuit one to three more times.

, Another possible HICT workout could be as follows:Do high-knee exercises for 30 seconds by bringing your knees up to your chest.
Next try some rapid pushups.
Stand up and do lunges, making sure your knees never go past your toes.
Finally, do an alternating side plank on both sides as many times as possible for 30 seconds.
Rest. Then, repeat the circuit one to three more times.
If you want, you could add a rotation to the pushups by leaning your weight on one hand, then the other, while holding the opposite hand up in the air directly away from the ground. This can make it more challenging.
If you need to make the circuit a little easier, try doing exercises with a reduced range of motion — such as pushups from the knees. Injury usually occurs when you are fatigued, so take extra care if you feel yourself reaching this point.

Consider the time of day.,
Consider the season.,
Consider the tides.",How to Find the Best Time for Fishing1," Fish are coldblooded, so their activity depends on the temperature of the water around them.They are inactive when it is cold, and when it is very hot they retreat to deeper waters to stay cool. Because fish eat bugs and/or little fish that eat bugs, they are most active when bugs are most active. When the air is warm and thick with mosquitos, fishing will be good.;
, Like all animals, fish come out in greater numbers during particular times of year. This will of course vary based on where you live and what sort of fish you hope to catch, but there are some general guidelines to keep in mind.Spring – Fish bite on and off during this season. You will have better luck later in the season, and later in the day, when things get a little warmer. Fish can’t do much eating on spring mornings, because the bugs aren’t out much yet, so your best bet is to take advantage of their feeding time at dusk. At this time of year winds will push the warmer, food-filled surface water toward the shore, so try to position yourself downwind along the shoreline.Summer – This is a good season for fishing if you avoid the hottest times of day. The fish will be biting well just before sunup and just after sundown, when food is abundant. Mid-day, when the sun is at its zenith, the fish will retreat to cooler, deeper water.Fall – This can be an inconsistent time, but when the fishing is good, it is really good. They will likely not bite much in the morning and early afternoon. Toward the end of the day, however, the water will be warm from hours of sunlight, and the fish will be driven to eat more than usual because of the impending food shortage that winter brings. Dusk is therefore an excellent time for fishing.Winter – For obvious reasons, not the best time for fishing. Unless you are ice fishing, which is a different thing entirely, you should leave your fishing rod in storage during this season.

, It is best to fish when the tide is rising or falling, as this change causes prey to move en-mass, and thus makes a great time for coastal fish to feed. Fishing will be much harder during low or high tide, when there is less water movement.To find out what time high and low tides are in your area, just Google ""tide chart"" and the name of the town you're in.
If you are fishing during a high tide, look for a shallow area.
If you are fishing during a low tide, look for a mud bank near a slough (an area with a depression in the bottom).

"
"
Keep an eye out for warm and cold fronts.,
Keep an eye on the wind.,
Keep an eye out for clouds.,
Keep an eye out for rain.",How to Find the Best Time for Fishing2," Because fish are coldblooded, they are deeply impacted by water temperature. This means their behavior can change quite a bit before and after cold or warm fronts.Many fish increase their feeding in the hours before a cold front hits, and slow in its aftermath. Thus, fishing after a cold front will rarely be a successful venture.
Warm fronts warm the surface water, and increase the amount of feeding fish can do. The difference is most noticeable in cold weather, when fish are usually not out much, and will not be of much use if it is summer, and the temperature was already quite high to begin with.

, Wind pushes surface water toward the far shore, and small prey fish with it, luring game fish. This makes windy days a good time for fishing.If you are fishing from shore on a windy day, cast into the wind. This will make your lure move in the same direction as the rest of the food, which will make it easier to attract game fish.
If fishing from a boat, cast toward shore in the same direction as the wind.

, Overcast days make fish bolder. They tend to swim further from safe structures when it is a little dim out. These are good fishing days., Rain can be your friend or your enemy, depending on how hard it is. Light rain is excellent fishing weather, especially in warm weather. It blurs the waters surface, making it harder for the fish to see you. It also washes lots of insects into the water, making it a prime time for fish to eat. Hard rain stirs up mud, and makes it harder for fish to hunt, breathe, and navigate. The fish don’t want to be out in that weather any more than you do, which is good because hard rains also create unsafe fishing conditions."
"
Pay attention to bugs.,
Make the moon your friend.,
Know your fish.,
Go fishing when you have the time.",How to Find the Best Time for Fishing3," Fish feeding activity is, of course, directly tied to insect activity. Smaller fish eat the insects, and game fish eat the smaller fish. As such, a hatch of flies or mosquitos is sure to create excellent fishing conditions. Just make sure you wear plenty of insect repellent., The moon controls the tides, which play a big role in fishing conditions. It is fairly easy to keep track of the tides by simply observing, but it can pay off to pay closer attention to the movements of the moon. Full moons, and times when the moon is close to the earth, tend to make for especially good fishing.There are lots of free online lunar calendars designed to help you find peak fishing hours., Different types of fish prefer different water temperatures, times of day, and food. If you are fishing for a particular species, do your research. If you want to catch catfish, it won’t matter when you go out if you never venture from shallow waters.

, It’s all well and good to know when the fish will be out in force, but the truth is that most of us simply go fishing when we have the time for it. You can enjoy a lovely afternoon of fishing with some beers and a friend without ever catching a thing. Don’t get so wrapped up in finding the right time that you forget to have a good time.

Start with the basic leg lift.,
Try lying straight leg lifts.,
Do extension lifts.,
Add resistance.",How to Do Static Leg Lifts1," When you raise your legs from the hips, you can strengthen your hips, which will result in increased mobility and less lower back pain. To perform the basic static leg lift, lie on your back on the floor.You can place your hands under your buttocks or lower back to help support your pelvis. You also can do this exercise with your arms along your sides, palms on the floor.
Start with your legs flat out on the floor. As you exhale, lift your legs off the floor from the hips and bend your knees towards your chest. Keep your back straight and flat against the floor.
Hold the pose for at least ten seconds before lowering your legs. If you can, you can hold the position twenty or thirty seconds.;
, Straight leg lifts are a little more difficult than the basic leg lift with bent knees. This exercise will help you further strengthen your hips as well as the muscles in your thighs.Do this exercise from the same position as you were in to perform the basic leg lift. However, instead of bending your knees, you will lift an extended leg up until your thighs are completely flexed. Your leg should be straight, but a slight bend in your knee is acceptable when you first begin. Keep your abs braced and your pelvis neutral throughout.
Make sure you are lifting from your hips, and try to go as far as you can without pain. Think of bringing your thighs to your chest rather than raising your foot straight up toward the ceiling.
Hold the pose for at least ten seconds. As you practice this exercise, you can extend the length of time that you hold it by ten seconds each time.

, Isometric hip extensions will help strengthen your hips as well as improving your balance. To do this exercise, you'll need a sturdy chair or table that you can hold onto for support.Stand to the side of your chair or table, supporting yourself for balance with your nearest arm.
Slowly raise your leg forward. If it helps, you can imagine that you are closing a door with your foot. Hold the position for 10 to 30 seconds, then lower it to the floor in a slow and controlled movement. Repeat two or three times, then change legs.
As you lift your leg, make sure you're not leaning too much and keeping your torso as straight as possible.

, Once you can hold the various leg lifts for one to two minutes without shaking or struggling, you might consider adding some weight to your leg or ankle to make the exercise more difficult.When using cuff weights to increase resistance, start with half a pound of weight and gradually add weigh in one-pound increments.
You typically can find cuff weights with slots that allow you to add weight to the cuffs in small, half-pound increments.

"
"
Try leg lifts from the side plank position.,
Try clams.,
Do a bridge series.,
Add leg lifts to planks.",How to Do Static Leg Lifts2," Leg lifts from the lower side plank position help strengthen your core as well as your hips, and also will increase the mobility in your hips and relieve tightness.Get into lower side plank position, resting on your elbow and forearm with your legs extended, ankles stacked. Make sure your elbow is directly under your shoulder.
Lift the top leg, being careful to keep your body in a straight line and not roll your hips forward or back with the movement. Hold this position for between ten and thirty seconds.
Once you've mastered leg lifts from the elbow side plank position, you can progress to leg lifts from raised side plank. This is a challenging exercise that also improves your balance and overall core stability.

, Clams will strengthen your hips, glutes, and thighs. This exercise is done lying on your side with your knees bent so that your ankles are aligned with your glutes.Lie on your side, bending your bottom arm at the elbow so you can rest your head in your palm. Bend the knee of your top leg 90 degrees, flexing your foot. Your bottom leg should be extended out, also with your foot flexed.
Raise your top leg up until you feel the muscles in your hips and thighs contracting. Hold for ten seconds, maintaining the 90-degree bend in your knee. Then lower until your leg is parallel to the floor. Make sure you aren't rolling your torso or hips back when you move your leg.

, Bridges themselves are static exercises that will greatly assist in stabilizing your pelvis. You also can do double-leg bridges or single-leg bridges in a dynamic series as a strength-building exercise.To do a double-leg bridge, lie on the floor on your back with your knees bent so that the soles of your feet are resting on the floor. Your arms should be by your sides, palms flat on the floor. On an exhale, engage your abs and lift your hips to create a bridge. Hold for a few breaths and then release.
A single-leg bridge uses the same movement as a double-leg bridge, except that you lift one leg straight towards the ceiling while the other remains flat on the floor. Make sure you do both sides.
Hold each bridge exercise for between ten and thirty seconds. Make sure to do it on each leg for single-leg exercises.

, The plank is a standard exercise for building core strength. If you combine leg lifts with planks, it will make the plank itself more challenging, but it also will help build strength in your hips and stabilize your pelvis.When lifting your legs while doing planks, make sure that your hips are not turning with the movement and that your body weight isn't shifting.

Try seated leg lifts.,
Isolate the muscles in your legs.,
Contract each individual muscle to maximum exertion.",How to Do Static Leg Lifts3," You may think seated leg lifts look pretty easy, but appearances can be deceiving. Even small movements will give you a serious workout.Sit up straight with your legs extended in front of you. Make sure your back is neutral and your shoulders are rolled back, not crunched forward. You may want to place a rolled towel or blanket behind your lower back to help your posture.
Lift one leg up and out to the side in a slow, controlled movement. Hold the lift for ten seconds, then slowly return it to center and lower. Do the other leg to complete one rep. Your range of motion may be small at first, but you can build up gradually as your muscles get stronger.

, If you learn how to isolate each of the muscles in your legs and contract them without moving, you can do isometric contractions. These static exercises will help tone your muscles, giving you a tighter and more fit appearance.If you've never done isometric contractions before, it may be easiest to start with large muscles such as quads or calves. You can work on contracting smaller muscles as you develop better body awareness.

, For isometric contractions to work, you need to be squeezing the muscle as tightly as you possibly can. With each repetition, try to squeeze the muscle a little more tightly.Hold the contraction for five seconds. Breathe deeply as you do so.As you practice, work your way to contracting the muscles for 60 seconds at a time.

Start by jumping rope.,
Include basics such as skipping and bunny hops.,
Try squat jumps.,
Add burpees or clapping push-ups.,
Do tuck jumps.,
Work your way up to box jumps and broad jumps.,
Plan your warm-up.,
Set up your circuit.,
Do cluster sets.,
Follow each session with a cool down.,
Consult your doctor.,
Identify your goals.,
Work with a certified trainer.,
Spend several months in strength training.",How to Do Plyometrics Workouts," Jumping rope is a basic plyometric exercise that nearly anyone can do, regardless of your athletic background. For this reason, it's a good place to start if you want to incorporate plyometrics into your workout routine.You can buy an adult workout-quality jump rope at any sporting goods store. Don't use a child's or recreation jump rope, as they will easily break with repeated intense use.
Instead of jumping rope, you can fake jumping rope or run in place.
If you're building circuits, you should jump rope for about 45 seconds, then rest for 15 seconds before moving on to the next exercise.;
, Especially if you're a beginner with limited athletic background, these simple exercises are a way to work plyometrics into your regular exercise regimen.Keep in mind you want to do these movements quickly and with high intensity.
Skipping and bunny hops can be a good interval to add to your circuit between exercises that target your upper body, to give those muscles time to rest.
The moderate intensity also makes these good exercises to do for a warm-up or cool-down.

, Squat jumps are powerful exercises that works your core and lower body, particularly your quads and glutes. Form is extremely important to avoid excessive pressure on your knees, so don't include squat jumps unless you can do multiple squats repeatedly with perfect form.To do squat jumps, you'll need a low step, box, or bench to jump on. It should be lower than your knees. Stand in front of the bench or step with your feet about hip-width apart.
Bend your knees to go into a full squat, being careful to maintain correct form with a neutral back. Don't let your knees move forward over your toes – your shins should be a relatively straight line perpendicular to the floor.
Pushing from the balls of your feet, jump onto the step or bench, landing in squat position. Then step back down and repeat the movement. Do these as quickly as you can with good form for about 45 seconds, or perform a fixed number of repetitions, such as ten jumps.
You can make squat jumps more challenging by starting on a very low step or curb and gradually moving up to a higher bench or box

, These are classic plyometric exercises that often are incorporated into regular exercise routines, especially high-intensity interval training. Burpees and clapping push-ups primarily target your core and upper body, but ultimately are whole-body exercises that can be integrated anywhere in your plyometric routine.To do a burpee, stand with your feet about hip-width apart, arms by your side. Lower into a squat and put your hands on the floor in front of you. Then jump your legs backwards so you're in a push-up or plank position. Push your chest back up and thrust your feet forward back into a squat position, then jump up, extending your hands over your head.
A clapping push-up is just like a regular push-up, except that when you raise up, push yourself up and lift your hands to clap in front of your chest. Then, put your hands back on the floor where they were, maintaining good position as your body lowers.
Do as many of these as you can do in 45 seconds with good form. Keep in mind that cheating on your form on these exercises can increase your risk of injury. You also should be careful of the impact on your wrists. Choose different exercises if you have an acute or chronic wrist injury such as carpal tunnel syndrome.
If you decide to include both of these exercises in your full routine, include an interval of a lower body exercise such as squat jumps in between so you don't overly fatigue your upper body.

, Tuck jumps are a powerful plyometric exercise that primarily works your hip flexors, although the rest of your lower body gets a good workout as well. While tuck jumps are a relatively easy exercise, only include them in your plyometrics workout if you can do them consistently with good form.Start your tuck jump standing with your knees slightly bent. Extend your arms in front of you at roughly chest height with your palms down.
Lower to about a quarter-squat then jump, raising your knees. Jump as high as you can, and try to hit your palms with your knees.
Extend your legs as your body lowers, keeping your knees slightly bent to help absorb the shock. Do as many of these as you can do with good form in 45 seconds, or perform a set number of repetitions. Start with 5 or 8 and try to work up the number of repetitions, until you can repeat the exercise for up to a minute.

, Even if you are relatively athletic, box jumps and broad jumps are advanced plyometric exercises. Get your body used to plyometrics workouts, then add these movements into your routine to challenge yourself.Box jumps are one of the most effective plyometric exercises to increase your vertical jump. To start, you'll need a box to jump on – the higher the box, the more challenging the exercise.
Get into a squat position with the box about 6 inches in front of you. From the squat, jump up to the box, landing softly on the balls of your feet. Use your entire body, including your arms, to make your jump as powerful as possible. Step off the box, get back into the squat position, and repeat the exercise as many times as you can in 45 seconds.
You can also do lateral box jumps, in which you place the box to your side rather than in front of you.
With broad jumps, use the squat position to propel yourself, thrusting forward to land on the balls of your feet. Focus on jumping as far as possible with consistently good form. Immediately transition into the next repetition, doing as many jumps as possible during the 45-second interval.

, Plyometrics are high-intensity exercises, so a 5 to 10 minute warm-up is essential to help prepare your muscles and reduce the risk of injury. Your warm-up should mimic the exercises you'll be doing during your plyometric workout.For example, if your workout includes squat jumps, include squats in your warm-up to get your body used to the proper form and technique and get blood flowing to the muscles you'll be using.
Include a cardiovascular element, such as jumping jacks or running in place, as well as dynamic stretches that will prep your muscles for the workout. Jogging adds general mobility and prepare your joints.

, Most plyometrics workouts are a series of exercises performed in a circuit. Arrange the movements you've chosen so that different body parts are being trained. If you put two exercises that work the same muscle group back-to-back, the consecutive fatigue will damage your form, decrease your level of performance, and increase your risk of injury.You should work with a certified trainer to build a circuit that will best meet your goals while remaining within your skill level.
Generally, arrange your circuits according to contacts. Each contact with the ground is additional stress and impact on your joints and your entire musculoskeletal system.
Decide on the number of sets to do based on the number of contacts. Beginners should have no more than 40 contacts per session, which typically equates to about a 10-minute plyometric workout. Experienced athletes, such as professional football players, may build plyometric workouts with as many as 200 contacts per session.
Keep in mind that you're focusing on the quality of your movements and doing them with speed. A plyometrics workout is not intended to be an endurance exercise, so your circuits likely will be very brief.

, Particularly if you're doing plyometrics exercises, cluster sets can improve your performance. Cluster sets involve doing a larger number of sets with fewer repetitions – typically between three and five – in each set.Cluster sets may benefit you if you have a specific goal, such as increasing your vertical jump height. Fewer repetitions means you can reach and maintain your maximum, whereas with more repetitions your maximum height would decrease due to muscle fatigue.
If you're doing cluster sets, you'll want to allow a longer rest period between sets, unless you're also doing supersets in which you follow an upper-body exercise immediately with a lower-body exercise.

, The shock of a plyometrics workout demands a five to ten minute cool-down to help your body readjust. Include cardiovascular cool-down as well as stretching within your normal range of movement.Walking or light jogging for 5 to10 minutes will slow your heart rate and decrease your body temperature.
Static stretches are more appropriate for cool-down than for warm-up, as they help your muscles relax.
An effective cool-down can help prevent lactic acid build-up and reduce the risk of muscle strain or injury, as well as allowing your heart rate to return to its normal resting rate.

, Plyometrics are advanced exercises commonly used by professional athletes interested in taking their power and speed to the next level. If you don't have an extensive sports and strength-training background, you risk serious injury.When you add plyometrics to your exercise regimen, you are drastically increasing the intensity of your workouts.
Plyometrics workouts can put intense stress on your joints, particularly your knees or ankles – especially if you don't have significant strength in the muscles and tendons surrounding those joints to absorb the shock. An orthopedic screening will ensure your body structure and posture are strong enough to do plyometrics.
You also may want to have a physical therapist evaluate you before you start a plyometrics workout, particularly if you have joint weakness or have previously had an injury to your knees or ankles.
Keep in mind that if you're not ready to do a full plyometrics workout, you still can integrate occasional plyometrics exercises into your regular workout routine for variety.

, While plyometrics can help you increase your coordination and agility as well as build your reactive strength, these aren't really general conditioning or strength-training exercises. Typically plyometrics are added to a workout program for a specific reason, such as to improve performance in a particular sport.For example, if you're a member of a community basketball team and want to increase your vertical jump height, you can design a plyometrics workout that focuses primarily on exercises that will increase your upward explosive power.
If you want to improve your performance in a particular sport, choose movements in your plyometrics workout that closely mimic the same movements you make while playing that sport.
For example, if you're a baseball player and want more explosive throwing power, you want to focus on upper-body plyometrics. However, tennis players may use plyometrics exercises to improve their ability to move side to side and make quick changes of direction.

, While you may be able to find simple plyometrics workouts to do online, the best plyometrics workout will be individually tailored to your skill level and fitness goals. A certified trainer with experience in plyometrics can help you achieve this.If you're already a member of a gym, find out which trainers working there have experience in plyometrics and would be willing to work with you.
Be prepared to explain your goals and describe your overall fitness level so the trainer can recommend movements that match your strength and skill.
The trainer may want to give you a reactive strength test, which will measure your current reactive strength so the trainer can help you design a program that will increase it.

, The creator of plyometrics recommends that anyone beginning this regimen should be able to squat at least 1.5 times their bodyweight. While there are lighter workouts without these requirements, strong muscles are essential to absorb the shock of jumps and cushion your joints.Focus your strength-training on your core and your lower body, as your knees and ankles will get most of the impact from any jumping exercises.
Even though plyometrics is not an endurance exercise, you still need general endurance. In just a few minutes, you'll be pushing muscle groups repeatedly into fatigue. Cardiovascular endurance is essential to avoid over-stressing your body.

Select your Florida fishing charter, and have an unforgettable fishing trip!

",How to Find a Fishing Charter Guide in Florida," Consider what kind of fish you're targeting - is it a freshwater or saltwater variety? Many charter captains specialize in particular styles of fishing, or particular areas in the Florida waters. You may want to choose your charter by one of the following specialties: flats and/or backcountry fishing; reef and wreck fishing; inshore and near shore fishing; or deep sea fishing. Some fishing charters specialize even by species, such as large mouth bass, tarpon, bill fish, etc.;
, When booking a fishing charter in Florida, you pay for the use of the boat for your entire fishing party, and the services of the captain and crew. (Only party boats charge a flat fee per person). Smaller boats hold 2-4 anglers; while bigger boats can hold up to six persons. Prices start at around $200-$400 to hire the smaller flats fishing boats for a 4-hour fishing trip. For bigger boats - ones that are used for deep sea fishing - and longer fishing trips, you can expect to pay between $900-$1200 for an 8-hour fishing day.

Check with local marinas, bait shops, or even just go down to the docks and hang out awhile, to observe charters in action as they depart and arrive. If you're still in the planning stage of your fishing trip, ask your travel agent to recommend a hotel or resort that offers a fishing charter as part of their package. Many hotels and some fish camps offer fishing charters as part of their packages. Not using a travel agent? The internet is a great way to narrow your search; just type your fishing preference in your preferred search engine (example: ""tarpon fishing charters Marathon Florida"") and you'll find a few to choose from.

, It's crucial to know specific information before you commit your money to book a fishing charter. The interview process is where the shady characters are usually revealed. Why? It doesn't take long to spot the genuine captain who loves what they do for a living, compared to the ones that aren't absolutely committed to their paying customer - YOU! Below are a few tips and questions to ask potential fishing charter captains, and things to consider as you narrow your list of charter candidates down to that perfect charter.

Locate a clam.",How to Dig Pacific Razor Clams1," Clams reside just under the surface of the sand. They can be deep, as much as a couple feet; or very shallow. To locate a razor clam, while slowly walking along tap the ground in front of you with your shovel blade, clam gun or simply stomp your feet, the vibration will cause the clam to dig itself deeper to escape an assumed threat. As the clam retreats the suction causes a hole or depression to appear on the surface of the sand, this is called a clam show. Depending on the depth of the clam, the water content of the sand, and other factors, show can manifest itself in different ways. These are typically known as a dimple, a doughnut, or a keyhole clam show.



Dimple; a depression with distinct edges and a bottom but no other deformations of the sand.

Doughnut; a depression with a bottom and raised edges resembling a doughnut.

Keyhole; a hole with no discernible bottom and distinct edges with no other deformations of the sand.

Position your shovel.,
Begin digging.,
Pull the handle back just enough to break the suction.,
Remove sand by lifting the shovel up and landward.,
Scoop sand in this way 2 - 4 times.",How to Dig Pacific Razor Clams2," Place the blade of the shovel from 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) from the show with the back of the shovel toward the surf. The handle of your shovel should be pointing landward.;
, Position your body weight over the shovel and push straight down while dropping to one knee. While keeping the blade as vertical as possible gently rock the shovel from side to side to make it easier to push into the hard sand. It is very important to keep the shovel as vertical as possible to avoid breaking the clam.

, Cracks will appear in the sand.

, Pulling the sand out of the hole, be very careful to avoid breaking the clam.

, Reaching into the hole you made with your hand, you should feel the clam. You may need to scoop out a little more sand by hand. Retrieve your razor clam.

Work the clam gun in a twisting motion to assist in plunging the gun into the sand.

,
Push the gun into the sand.,
Place your thumb over the air vent and pull upward keeping your back straight while using your legs to pull the gun up and out.

Check for your clam.,
If the clam didn't come up with the gun, reach into the hole and retrieve your clam.

",How to Dig Pacific Razor Clams3," Facing the Ocean, place the clam gun directly over the clam show. Quickly remove it to ensure that you are indeed centered over the clam show.

,,, Plunge the clam gun 6 to 10 inches (15.2 to 25.4 cm) below the surface. Repeat 2 to 3 times. If you are stronger you should be able to push the gun into the sand 12 to 18 inches (30.5 to 45.7 cm) and only need one plunge.

, Standing timber can produce bass, but fishing timber can be a tad tricky, so make sure you have spare lures and time to re-tie.

, The last place they hide is in shallow reeds, near spawning flats.

,, These fish love rocky ""humps"", or areas that are shallow but surrounded by deep open water.

, Mud bottoms are also places these fish will be found, feeding on crawdads.

Remove the head of the trout.,
Cut the first fillet along the top of the backbone.,
Flip the trout over and cut the second fillet.,
Remove the pin bones.,
Get rid of the skin.",How to Debone a Trout1," Filleting should be done when you wish to serve only the finest cut of the fish, rather than cooking it whole. Start by cutting through the neck of the trout at the groove of the gills. Angle the blade of your knife so that you’re cutting toward the head rather than the body to preserve the meat.Always use a filleting knife or other sharp blade when preparing fish. This results in much neater, more economical cuts.;
, Place the trout on its side with the belly facing away from you. Start a small cut on the top side of the backbone at the opening where you removed the head. Insert your filleting knife into this groove and run the knife down the length of the fish, staying just above the backbone. Finish by slicing through the section at the base of the tail. You now have a clean, meaty fillet.


If you’re staying close enough to the backbone, you should be able to hear an audible clicking as you slice through the rib bones.

, Turn the trout over on its opposite side and repeat the filleting process. Start the cut at the head and slice smoothly along the upper edge of the backbone until the entire fillet has been cut away., Place each fillet skin side down and pick out each and every pin bone you find. Scrape along the flesh with your knife or pick up each fillet and flex it to expose bones that are lodged deep. Nothing ruins a fresh fish dinner like a mouthful of crunchy bones!It’s alright if you don’t get every last tiny bone—even professional chefs sometimes miss a few.

, Now that the trout has been filleted and deboned, you only need to make one more cut to remove the skin. Take hold of the fillet on the tail end and use your filleting knife to cut into the flesh at an angle until you reach the outer layer of skin. Run the knife edge along the bottom of the fillet while tugging the skin lightly in the opposite direction. The skin should come away clean. Repeat with the second fillet and you’re ready to grill, bake or fry!Again, while it is not necessary to remove the skin prior to cooking, it is commonly done when filleting fish and makes it easier to eat.

Snip away the outer anatomy of the trout.,
Cut along the length of the belly.,
Loosen the backbone.,
Remove the backbone and ribcage.,
Pull out any remaining bones.",How to Debone a Trout2," If you intend to serve the trout whole, deboning it with scissors will allow you to keep the fish intact. Start by using the scissors to cut away the fins, the tail and any loose flaps of skin that might get in your way while you’re cutting. If the head has not already been removed, use a sharp knife to cut into the upper area of the gills just below the trout’s head; there are natural grooves here that serve as vents to the gills and make the perfect place to cut to remove the head.It’s not necessary to remove the skin prior to cooking.
When removing the head, bear down on the knife and use a quick chopping strike on the back of the blade to sever the backbone without making a mess., Make a small incision in the uppermost part of the trout’s belly where you removed the head. Slowly cut down the length of the belly. Use long, smooth motions with the scissors to keep the cut neat and prevent mangling the fish. Keep cutting until you’ve covered the length of the belly, ending where the tail was.


Raw fish sometimes contains small parasites and harmful bacteria. Remember to wash the scissors after using them.

, Open up the body of the trout by separating the fish at the cut you just made. Place the trout flesh side down against the cutting board. Run a narrow, blunt surface, such as the knife’s handle or the tip of your finger, along the backside of the trout where the backbone sits. Apply a moderate amount of pressure and make a few quick passes. This will help loosen the backbone so that it can be extracted with less difficulty.Be careful not to apply so much pressure that you damage the meat. The idea is just to start coaxing the backbone and ribcage away from the body of the fish.

, Turn the trout back over, skin side down. Take hold of the backbone nearest the tail section and pull it up and away from the flesh to remove it. Pull slowly and gradually, taking care not to tear away flesh or break any bones. When done correctly, the ribcage should come away effortlessly with the backbone.

You can also score alongside the edges of the backbone with your filleting knife if you’re having a hard time getting it out in one piece.
Don’t worry if the ribcage doesn’t come out as smoothly as you’d life. You’ll be picking out leftover bones anyway.

, With the backbone and ribcage gone, you’re left with a nice piece of fish that has been cut down the center and opened up; this is what’s known as “butterflying.” Keep the trout skin side down and run the blade of the knife along the length of the fish at an angle. This will dislodge any of the small, delicate rib bones (also called “pin bones”) remaining in the flesh so that they can be removed by hand or with tweezers.

Most of the remaining pin bones will be found in the darker meat around the center of the trout.
Remove as many of the pin bones as you can to avoid any unpleasant surprises while eating.

"
"
Cook the trout.,
Make a small cut at the base of the tail.,
Lift the tail portion while pulling down on the flesh.,
Turn the fish over and strip the other side.",How to Debone a Trout3," For this method, you’ll start by cooking the trout completely before removing the bones. The heat from the cooking process will loosen up the connective tissues around the backbone, making it easy to simply peel away. Cooking the fish before deboning allows it to retain more of its natural flavor; the bones can then be quickly and effortlessly discarded.Whatever method you prefer should work just fine for cooking a whole fish, as long as the heat is not so intense that it causes it to fall apart (be careful with deep frying, for instance).

, If you’ve cooked the fish whole, lift the tail and find the place just below it where the fillet begins—otherwise, start at the already cut tail section of the trout. Make a cut here with a knife, or by inserting a fork. This will create a path to pull the bones away from the meat.


You should be able to locate the best place begin separating the backbone by following the cut used to gut the trout to where it ends at the tail section.

, Using the knife or fork to anchor the trout, lift the tail or tail flap up and away from the meat. By doing this, you should be able to strip the bones away in one clean movement., Still holding the tail, turn the piece of fish over. Cut into the meat on the opposite side and peel the tail away to extract the backbone. You’re now left with all of the meat to enjoy and none of the bones.


While it shouldn’t be difficult to remove the backbone and ribcage intact after cooking, make sure to keep an eye out for stray pin bones while eating.

Buy a heavy-duty fishing rod.,
Use a sturdy fishing line.,
Choose realistic-looking jigs.",How to Do Jig Fishing1," For jig fishing, purchase a heavy action or extra-heavy action rod. A stronger rod will handle large fish better and hold up if your line gets caught in the heavy cover (e.g. seaweed) that they often hide in. Shop for a fishing rod at your local sporting goods store to properly gauge the feel and sturdiness of different models. , Purchase a heavy braided fishing line of 50 pounds or more for jig fishing to avoid breaking. Heavier lines will not stretch, allowing you to pull in bigger fish more efficiently. A sturdier line will also stand up to thick cover like heavy vegetation and be easier to free if it gets stuck., If possible, try to use jigs that resemble the prey of the fish you are trying to catch (e.g. smaller fish local to the body of water). Jigs come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors. To start, buy an assortment of jigs to experiment with, and to use in different water temperatures and with different types of cover."

Know what type of stream you are walking.,
Find a location.,
Wearing waders and boots, enter the stream near the mouth.,
Continue walking up stream watching step for salmon redds.,
Walk the stream until you have reached a predetermined stopping point or a blockage that would not allow salmon the pass.,
While conducting this survey exercise environmental protection methods.,Make sure that you return any carcasses found back to the river to ensure the transfer of marine derived nurturance.,
Do not break up beaver dams or log jams as they are an important part of the habitat as well.,
Follow these steps in the event you see a live salmon:

Slowly move around it (on the bank if possibly) so you do not disturb it.,
Follow these steps in the event you see a dead salmon:

Use the gaff to retrieve the carcass and take to and nearby area to take samples.",How to Do a Salmon Spawning Survey," Must surveys are done on tributaries. These can be very different depending on the area you are surveying. Water clarity is very important to complete a proper survey. Substrate is another key factor. A muddy sediment substrate can cause visibility issues while walking. With this in mind always try to walk up stream so the sediment cloud does not impede your visibility as well.
, In general the best areas to conduct your survey will be located in portions of tributaries off the main stem of a river. (note1. do not trespass on private property), Slowly begin walking up stream looking under logs, large rocks, and undercut banks for live or dead salmon., (do not step in redds)., These could be log jams, beaver dams, or culverts.,

Do not step in Redds. Salmon redds are the area where salmon move substrate creating a divot in the steam bed, to lay their eggs. Redds typically consist of small to medium sized gravel around the outer edge with larger gravel at the base of the divot.

,,

When crossing over a logjam use extreme caution. Try to walk around it if possible. If not, make sure you have a stable footing with each step. Do not break up logs no matter what the size is.

,
Keep a live count on your paper noting sex, and specie if possible.
Mark a way point in the general area that saw the salmon.

,
Turn the coded wire tag (CWT) wand on and scan the top of the head for a tag. If the wands beeps, make a note of it.
Using the cloth tape, measure from the front (mouth) the end of the tail. record.
Using the forceps, remove three scales and place them on the scale card.
Using the hole punch, punch a whole in the cuddle (tail) fin and place the sample in the contain with a label.
If your test for a coded CWT was positive, you will now remove the head.
Make a downward cut behind the eyes of the fish to the corner of its mouth. At this point the top portion should be free.
Place it in a new contain with a the same label number as the genetic sample.
Finally, you will cut off the tail and place the carcass back in the water. This is done so that fish can not be recounted at a later date.
Record all data taken and the date as well as the name of the body of water you are surveying.

Set up your fishing rod.,
Cast out your line.,
Wait for your jig hook to hit the bottom of the body of water.,
Snap and pop the line.,
Use the “swimming” technique.",How to Do Jig Fishing2," Hold the fishing rod with your casting hand at the base of the reel. Leave about 12 inches (approximately 30 cm) of line hanging between your bait hook and the tip of the rod. Grab the line with your index finger and keep it taut., Make sure that there is nothing behind you for the line to catch onto (e.g., a tree or other person). Aim the line at the line towards the spot in the water you want it to land in, then pull it backwards. Cast it out and release your index finger from the line., After casting your rod, wait several seconds for the jig hook to reach the bottom. If the bait is heavy enough you may feel the spoon hit the bottom. Note that lightweight jig hooks will take longer to sink., Make boisterous vertical motions with your rod by flicking your wrist and popping your fishing rod tip up a short distance. Allow the jig hook to sink back to the bottom. Repeat this process to get the attention of larger fish looking for food.Vary your movements by jigging the rod up and down and side-to-side.

, Cast your line out into the water. Hold your fishing rod at a 60 degree angle and slowly reel the line in. This motion will cause the jig to flow through the water smoothly, appearing to swim."
"
Pay close attention to your line.,
Hold onto the rod tightly.,
Engage your reel to pull in the fish.",How to Do Jig Fishing3," Be sure to keep a close eye on your fishing line while it is in the water. When you have a bite, your line will usually jolt at the surface of the water. Watch for this sort of movement, as it may not be jarring enough for you to feel it all the way through your line and fishing rod., Big fish will put a lot of pressure on the line as they try to swim away. Once a fish has gone for your bait, lower your fishing rod to a 45 degree angle and hold on tightly. Stay in this position until the fish stops pulling on the line., Holding the line steady, pull the fishing rod upwards as if you want to form a 90 degree angle. Lower the rod back to a 45 degree angle, engage your reel and begin to pull in your catch. Repeat this raising/lowering/and reeling-in pattern until you bring in your catch."

Find the right salmon.,
Remove the head by taking a knife and slicing down on the 'neck area' behind the eyes and above the gills.,
Move your knife to the base of the tail where the fish's ""vent"" is.,
Remove everything within the belly (depending on the sex of the fish there may be eggs or a sperm sack).,
Rinse the fish in fresh water.

,
Cut a line down the base of the back.,
Cut through the meat toward the stomach.,
Remove a 'fillet' from the meat, but do not remove it from the tail.,
Starting on the other side, once again cut a strip of meat from the base of the spine, filleting all the way to the stomach, removing the rib cage.,
Remove the rib cage (body).,
Cut slices In each fillet.,
Cut one vertical slice down the stomach side: To prevent your fish from curling while drying, cut one vertical slit (again not going through the skin but only the meat) down the stomach of the fish and through the cartilage of the mouth.

,
Repeat the previous two steps on the other side.,
Hang the fish outside in the sun and wind for one day, skin facing out.,
Flip the fish and continue drying.,
Smoke the fish for two weeks.",How to Cut Dryfish," Different salmon species have different features and invite different methods of cooking. To make dry fish you will want to avoid King Salmon and Coho Salmon. Opt for ""Chums"" (also known as Arctic Kita) or Humpy's (also known as pinks). Red Salmon can also be used. The fish must be as fresh as possible, and never frozen.

, Keep the bottom lip on the fish, but remove the cheeks and gills along with the head.;
, Starting at this hole, insert your knife and slice the fish upwards towards the head. Slice the fish entirely up the belly until it can be spread open.

, Once all of the guts have been removed, take the knife and cut the 'blood line' (which can be found at the base of the spine within the open belly; it will look like a dark red strip). Remove all of the blood from within the blood line.

,, Turn the fish to one side. On the back of the fish, an inch beyond the spine, cut the meat and continue to slice the meat all the way to the base of the tail.

, Avoid the rib cage. Use your knife and cut down toward the stomach of the fish, tracing the rib cage as you cut.

, Follow the meat cut up to the base of the tail and then stop.

, Keep the meat on at the base of the tail.

, Once you have cut the fillets on each side of the fish, you should have three strips connected together at the base of the tail. Keep both of your fillets attached to the tail, but remove the body, by cutting through the spinal cord at the base of the tail.

, Starting on one fillet, lay it flat on the cutting board. Hold the knife at an angle, and slice the fish's meat approximately 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the base of the tail. Do not cut through the skin of the fish. Cut only the meat. Continue making slits in the fish every 2 inches (5.1 cm) until you reach the bottom.

,, With your other fillet, repeat this process of cutting slices into the fish and one vertical strip down.

, Hang the fish only on sunny, windy days when the flies are not active. Hang the fish off the ground (typically on a pole with one fillet on each side). The skin should be facing outwards, the fillets inwards. Allow them to sun-dry for 24 hours.

, Flip the fish so that the fillets are facing outwards and let them dry again for another 24 hours in the sun and wind.

, Hang the fish in a smokehouse and keep smoke on the fillets for two to four weeks. Alder smoke works best, and alder chips are typically quite affordable.

Take It Easy - The first thing to do is relax.,
Steady As She Goes - When the fish slows down and stops taking more line, it’s time to go to work.,
Close The Deal - When the fish gets close, this is a critical time in the fight because often it will panic when it sees the boat.,
Catch And Release - Use a net to land the fish.",How to Fight a Fish," New anglers tend to panic when a fish is taking out line and reel furiously, which puts a twist in the line for each time they crank it if they are using a spinning rod. Let the drag and rod do the work. Before the fight, you should have set your drag — using a hand scale — at around 25 percent of the line’s breaking strength, so if you are using 12-pound test, you should be using about 4 pounds of drag. Unless you have hooked Moby Dick, this should slow the fish down. If it looks like it’s not stopping, pull up the anchor and idle after the fish. But don’t apply more drag, just make sure to keep the rod at about a 45-degree angle to the water, and point it in the direction to where the line enters the water.;
, The best technique for the catch is to gently pull the rod up and then reel down as you lower it, using a pumping motion. Do it in small, smooth strokes rather than large abrupt sweeps because it will help keep both the line tight and the fish much calmer. If the fish runs again, let it go and you will probably notice that this run is shorter. That’s a good sign — it means you are wearing the fish down. While you don’t want to horse a fish, you don’t want to let it rest during the fight either, so when the reel isn’t singing, you should be trying to regain line ... even if it is only a few inches at a time.

, If the fish is directly below the boat, make sure you don’t hold the rod too high, or it can break. If the fish suddenly goes under the boat, jam the rod tip straight down in the water so it won’t snag the bottom of the boat or foul on the engine’s lower unit. If you need a little extra pressure when pumping the fish, use the palm of your hand on the spool, but be ready to take it off if the fish runs. When a really big fish gets close to the boat, use side pressure to try to turn the fish’s head by smoothly pulling the rod toward the fish’s tail. This often causes the fish to give up the fight, which makes the next part easier.

, If you are releasing the fish, make sure the net is wet, so it will be less abrasive to the fish’s protective slime. If you have a helper, place them between you and the fish and lead the fish toward the net by walking backwards when you can’t reel any more. Never try to sweep the net at the fish from behind, always net toward the fish’s head, because it can’t swim backwards. If you are keeping the fish for dinner, get it on ice. If you are releasing it, take a picture and get it back in the water, taking time to resuscitate it by grabbing it by the tail and moving it back and forth in the water until it swims off. Like the back of the shampoo bottle reads under its instructions: “Repeat.”

Teach solid recall.,
Teach your dog to ""leave it"" and/or ""drop it"".,
Build up your dog's endurance.",How to Teach Your Dog Hiking Skills," If your dog will be off-leash in the woods, he should come when called, every time (or close to it). Practice off-leash with your dog at home, then in a yard, then in a dog park where your dog can roam off-leash.


Choose a calling word. It doesn't have to be his name, and it probably shouldn't be if you (or anyone in the house) has ever used his name to scold him. Some people use a whistle instead of a calling word.
Reward your dog every time he looks at you or comes to you. The reward doesn't have to be a treat, though if you have low-calorie, high-value treats, it's always a good default. If your dog loves playing tug or fetch, reward him with that.
Never call a dog to you so you can punish him or put a leash on him. Lure him with something else, like a toy, or chase him if you have to, but just make sure that you avoid any chance for him to associate coming to you when called with being punished (or anything negative, for that matter). Responding to your call should be something he loves to do because good things happen every time he does it.;
, If the dog is chewing on something he shouldn't, or is about to roll around in poop, it's useful to be able to tell him to stop (and have him listen to you).

, This isn't so much a skill, but is developed in the same way. Before taking your dog on a 10 mile (16 km) hike, take him one several smaller hikes once or twice a week, gradually adding distance. His paws will need time to toughen and his heart and lungs will need a bit of preparation as well.

Know your water needs.,
Bring along plenty of water.,
Drink in swallows, not sips.,
Do not ration your water.,
Include salt in your diet.,
Stay covered.,
Seek shade in the hottest part of the day.,
Eat less if you're running out of water.",How to Stay Hydrated in a Desert1," Due to differences in climates and individuals, it's difficult to predict your exact needs. As a starting estimate, expect to sweat out 500–700 mL (17–24 oz) every hour while walking at 35ºC (95ºF), or 700–900 mL per hour of walking at 40ºC (104ºF).Drink enough water to make up for this amount, and pay attention to your urine. If your urine is mostly clear, you are well hydrated. If it is dark or has a strong smell, you need more water.


Aim for the lower range of this estimate if you are in the shade, and the higher range when walking in the sun. You will not need as much water while sitting.
Most people underestimate the amount of water they need. Rely on solid measurements or urine color, not on how thirsty you feel.;
, Bring more water than you need, in several containers. Store the excess back in your vehicle or shelter. If possible, store it somewhere away from direct sunlight, which can make water unpleasantly hot, and eventually wear down plastic containers.

, Sipping water may prevent the water from reaching your vital organs. Drink at least a few swallows at a time to ensure effective hydration.Drinking too much water on an empty stomach can lead to vomiting. If you think this may happen, start with a swallow or two. Wait a few minutes for your stomach to settle, then drink some more.

, Trying to save your water will just make the symptoms of dehydration set in sooner. Even in an emergency situation, drink enough water to stay hydrated whenever possible. Although drinking will trigger your body to urinate, most of it is water you would have lost anyway., You will also lose sodium and potassium as you sweat, which can decrease water retention and eventually cause serious health problems.Snack occasionally on food that contains salt, as well as potassium-rich foods such as bananas, dried apricots, or nuts.If your sweat does not taste salty, or does not sting when it falls into your eye, you need more salt.
Salt only helps water retention if you are hydrated enough to take advantage of this effect. If you are dehydrated, large amounts of salt can make the problem worse., Any exposed skin encourages perspiration due to rapid evaporation. Wear a hat and lightweight, long-sleeved shirt and trousers., In most deserts, especially in summer, conditions are brutally hot from about 10 am to 4 pm. One of the most effective ways to conserve water is to stay in shade during this time, away from wind. Do not exert yourself during this time.In an emergency situation, walk during the night instead of the day.

, In an emergency, conserve water by eating as little as possible. You can survive much longer without food than water, and digestion takes water out of your system."

Look for wildlife.,
Dig near vegetation.,
Dig in drainages.,
Dig at runoff points.,
Look for water pockets after a rain.,
Purify the water.",How to Stay Hydrated in a Desert2," Birds circling or making noise are often visiting a waterhole, or at least damp ground where you could dig for water. Flying insects are another promising sign, as are animal tracks heading downhill.Bees in particular often fly directly between water sources and the hive.

, In general, the greener the plant, and the wider its leaves, the more it needs a permanent water source. Digging near a promising tree or dense vegetation can sometimes lead to water.


When digging, choose a low spot where water would naturally drain. Dig about 30 cm (1 ft) deep. If you notice damp soil, make the hole wider and wait a few hours for water to seep in.

, These are dry most of the year, but water may linger underground. The best option is a canyon with the mouth facing away from the sun (north in the Northern Hemisphere, or south in the Southern). Walk upstream and dig at the base of the wall, or anywhere that feels damp.


In dry riverbeds, the force of the water may have eroded the outside bend of a river during a tight turn. The last flow of water may get trapped in an eroded depression here, so this is a good place to dig., These are sometimes difficult to identify without experience, but they're worth a try if you don't see anything else. The most promising features are slopes of hard, impenetrable rock, disappearing under the sand or soil., Water and wind can wear holes into stone, which then fill with water after a rain. Isolated rock outcrops and level surfaces are the best places to look for these.


In shady canyons or valleys, these pockets can stay full for days after a rainstorm, sometimes for weeks in a cool, sheltered area.

, Whenever possible, pour the water through a microfilter, or drop in purification tablets (such as iodine). That said, in an emergency, go ahead and drink it. Dehydration is more dangerous than waterborne disease, especially in a desert.


Boiling water is even more effective, if you have access to a fire. All pathogens should be killed by the time the water reaches a boil, so no significant amount of water will be lost to steam."

See a doctor first about any foot issues you know might become worse on the trail.,
Get fitted for the proper type of boot.,
Stock your first-aid kit with a special kit dedicated to foot care.,
Bring correct socks and plenty of them.,
Take the opportunity to soak aching feet in streams as you can.,
Take off boots and change into camp shoes when you finish hiking for the day.

",How to Prepare Your Feet for Hiking,";
, Keep in mind your foot type as well as the length and type of trail you will be hiking.

, Include moleskin, Vaseline, tincture of Benzoin, band aids, antibiotic cream, needles, scissors, and antiseptic.

, One of the worst things for feet is moisture. You should use liner socks and be prepared to change them as your feet sweat.

, This will bring down swelling and reduce pain.

Scout yourself an Alice Pack.,
Prepare physically.,
Select your load.,
Spend time under the ruck.",How to Start Rucking (Military)," Alice packs are the number one pack used for training; their most notable features are the external frame for high loads. Most can be found at your local military surplus store. Be sure it is in moderate to good condition with little to no tears or abrasions at the bottom.


Take special notice of your load-lifter straps and belt stabilizer straps, which easily break from a more strenuously used pack.
;
, This will take a few months if you are not usually active to prepare for high mileage rucks. Take special consideration into weight training your lower body.

With a stationary bike, aim for at least 3 x 5-10 minute sessions at high-resistance intermixed with your daily weight training routine (squat - bike - lunge - bike). You will also notice it can simulate walking (with proper seat adjustment and wheel-resistance) with a loaded pack.
Do lunges (dumbbell overhead and one-legged split lunge) and squats (front-load and back-load) to develop leg strength. Aim for both high rep (20) and also high load (squats: 240 at 7 reps). Calf raises, preferably standing-dumbbell calf raises, also develop the proper leg strength needed.
Running is also a must; aim for varied hill/flat sprints intermixed with long distance running - for example, run 3 miles (4.8 km) 3 days a week and do hill sprints (at 80-90% effort) 2 times a week.

, You'll need to make your pack heavy. Some of the cheapest options include bird seed (pre-weighed), which can be dumped safely if needed, rock salt, or gravel/sand. You can also use dumbbell weights wrapped/taped in towels. Gatorade bottles filled with rocks is an effective way to fill your outer pockets and add a little extra weight when needed.

, Now that you've got the basics, get out there and ruck. Keep your head up, eyes scanning your surrounding and 20 feet (6.1 m) ahead of your path. Resist the habit to stare at your feet, which is less tactical. Keep your legs straight, back tight - concentrate on your posture, which will inevitable round out the further you go.

Set yourself up with the right equipment when hiking with a baby.,
Build your and your child's tolerance for hiking by starting off on shorter distances.,
Take safety precautions when hiking with a young child.,
Be prepared before heading out on a hike with baby so that you have everything you need and are able to deal with any issues or hazards that may arise.,
Dress yourself and your baby appropriately.,
Be patient when hiking with a baby and don't have any preconceived expectations about how the trip is going to be.",How to Take a Baby on a Hike," For a baby aged between 1 and 5 months old, select a front carrier for his head and neck support. When your child is able to sit independently, choose a secure back carrier. A hiking stroller is another option, but it may be restrictive with some terrain. Test your equipment before using it on the hike to be sure you and your child are both comfortable.;
, This way you don't head out on a long hike and find that your baby has had enough before you have even hit the midway point. Select a baby friendly hiking trail with a terrain that is not difficult to walk. You can research the best trails by calling state park informational services. The length of the trail that you can hike with baby is subjective and usually dependent on the age of the child. Again, this is a guessing game, so start out on a short trail and see how your baby deals with it.

, Make sure you are hiking on a clearly distinguished trail and that you are equipped with a map and GPS. Remain on the trail and organize your hike with another adult so that you have support when dealing with the baby.

, Always have a good supply of water for you, and milk or drinks and snacks for the little one. Pack food in convenient Ziploc bags and make sure it is easily accessible. Carry a first-aid kit, sunscreen, and bug spray; just make sure that you use the appropriate screen and bug spray for your child.

, Wear layers that can be shed easily and comfortable hiking shoes. If your child can walk, dress him in the same manner, but if he is a baby, make sure to dress him so he doesn't get too hot or cold, but protected from the sun. Select an outfit that allows for easy diaper changes. Your child should also have a hat, even if you choose not to wear one yourself.

, A baby usually has his own plan and often that plan does not meet your perfect view of how things will go. Expect that there will be crying, whining, and a lot of stops. The journey may be slow going with a young child who wants to pick up every leaf and throw every rock, but take it as it is, and remember that this is all new to your child. Promise yourself that you will enjoy the experience no matter what. You also want to learn from it so that you can modify certain aspects of your next hiking trip.

Consider trail runners.,
Get to know the dimensions of your feet.,
Research brands and models that favor your foot type.,
Buy boots from a store with a flexible return policy.,
Get the right size.,
Break in your hiking boots.,
Use a surgeon's knot to isolate the lacing tension in various parts of your shoes.,
Use the heel lock technique to, well, lock your heel down.,
Look for insoles that will help low-volume feet ""fill out"" the boot so that your heel doesn't lift.,
Buy or make a tongue depressor.,
Employ the tried and true blister prevention strategies:


Apply an anti-chafing substance to the areas that are prone to blisters before putting on your socks.,
When you take breaks from hiking, take off your shoes and let your feet breathe.",How to Prevent Heel Lift in Hiking Boots," The ""right boots"" might not be boots at all. Many people who've suffered through heel blisters have found sweet relief by hiking in lighter shoes that don't wrap around the ankle. The common reaction to this suggestion is ""but I need the ankle support!"" Consider that maybe, with the right conditioning, you can strengthen your ankles and feet, and do not need heavy boots.If you'd rather wear boots, however...;
, There's a lot more to your feet than the size, and normally the other stuff doesn't matter...But when you're racking up miles upon miles walking on uneven terrain, it becomes painfully obvious when your footwear does not conform to your unique foot. If you go to a good shoe store, you can get your feet measured accurately for all of the following:


How wide are your feet? Width comes into play around the balls of your feet. If your boots are too narrow, you've probably suffered the dreaded black pinky toenail.
How narrow is your heel? Many people who get heel blisters have narrow heels, and this contributes to heel lift because the heel area of the boot is too big to snugly hold the heel in place.
Do you have a low, medium, or high volume foot? In rough terms, this describes how ""bulky"" or ""skinny"" your feet are. Two people can have the same exact shoe size and width and still have a totally different fit in the same pair of boots.If you tend to get irritation or blisters on the top of your foot (rubbing up against the tongue of a shoe) you probably have high volume feet. Having low volume feet can contribute to heel blisters because your foot will slide up into the extra room in your boot and let your heel lift from the sole.
Note that each factor can vary from one of your feet to the other. It's not uncommon for people to have feet in two different sizes.

, Some manufacturers tend to favor boots that fit certain criteria.


La Sportiva boots are reputed to have a good fit for people with narrow, low-volume feet.Vasque and Asolo boots tend to run narrow.Search the web for the specifics of your feet, such as:

hiking boot brands narrow heel wide toes
best hiking boots low volume feet
finding hiking boots narrow feet heels



, The REI store chain is best known for its generous return policy; you can buy boots, try them out on several hikes, and if they are not a good fit, you can return them within a year of the purchase date., You might think sizing is pretty straightforward, but it's not...


People are at least twice as likely to buy shoes that are too small rather than too big.Feet swell throughout the day, and more so during a hike. Try on shoes at night.
Bring the hiking socks that you actually wear when you go hiking. Wear them as you try on shoes.

, Don't get too ambitious and go on a 15 mile (24 km) hike with your new boots! Give them a chance to conform to your feet (and give your feet a chance to conform to the boots). Be patient and hike in small increments, gradually increasing distance and elevation gain, for the first 15–30 miles (24–48 km) you spend in your new boots.

, For example, if you want to keep the toe box loose and wide but you want to tighten the boot around your ankle, you would lace loosely around the top of your foot, use a surgeon's knot, then lace more tightly the rest of the way. To make a surgeon's knot:


Cross the laces.
Bring one lace over and under the ""bridge"" you just created. This is the simple knot everyone makes when tying their shoes.
Bring that same lace over and under the ""bridge"" again. This extra loop creates extra friction that locks in the tension.
Tighten by pulling the laces apart.

,


Lace your shoes normally through the lacing holes. Stop before you get to the hooks (there are usually two on each side of a hiking boot, at the ankle portion).
Instead of diagonally crossing the laces, have them go straight up to the hooks.
From the hooks, cross the laces and bring them underneath the section that went straight from the lacing hole to the lacing hook.
Bring the laces back together and tie them tightly. Pull and you will feel the pulley system you just created locking your heel into place.

, Many people have reported success in addressing heel blisters with Superfeet insoles (the green version)., This is a piece of foam that goes either between your foot and the tongue of your boot, or between the tongue and the laces, to fill out the extra space if you have low volume feet which push up into the tongue area (and let the heel come up) as you climb.

,
Wear a liner sock under your hiking socks to wick moisture away and provide a barrier for friction.
Use wool hiking socks, which manage moisture better instead of holding it in like cotton socks do.
Apply duct tape, moleskin, or leukotapeon hot spots as soon as you feel them forming.

, Better yet, switch out your socks for something drier.

Put the backpack on and adjust the straps.,
Measure each side of the straps to ensure an equal distribution.,
Fold the remaining material.,
Tuck the material under the mechanism.",How to Shorten Backpack Straps1," The cushion on the top of the strap should rest evenly and comfortably on top of your shoulders. The backpack should not sag below your behind. Instead, it should run parallel to your back when you are walking.If you notice the backpack sagging below your behind, there may be too much weight in the backpack or you may need to get a backpack that has a reinforced bottom so it does not sag.;
, You can measure each strap by taking off the backpack and holding each strap taunt next to each other. Make sure both straps are the same length as uneven straps may strain your body, especially your neck and shoulders. As well, even straps will ensure there is an equal distribution of weight when you wear your backpack.

, You may need to make one to two folds to tuck the straps under the tightening mechanism. You may also cut the remaining material if the straps are too long and you have no future use for them. Leave 2-4 inches for room to adjust.


If you cut the material, melt the folded area with a lighter., Feel free to reinforce the fold with some twine or rubber bands to help the straps to stay in place. You can tie the twine around the fold and secure it with a knot or wrap rubber bands around the fold to secure it in place.

Hike with a partner.,
Choose a hike that is right for you.,
Go for a hike with elevation gain.,
Aim for at 45-60 minutes of hiking.,
Don’t start too late in the day.,
Check the weather forecast.,
Make sure you are properly equipped.",How to Turn a Hike Into a Workout1," While hiking alone can be wonderful, it’s important to take someone along with you if you can. This is especially important if you are new to hiking, or if you are visiting a new trail for the first time. Having a partner hiking alongside you means that you have a safety net should you get injured or lost.;
, Hiking is a fantastic way to work out. But before you head out on the trails, it is important that you choose a hike that fits your experience and fitness level. If you’ve never been hiking before, start small. For example, you could choose an easier, two-mile hike on a local trail. If you can’t run or walk a mile, have asthma, or suffer from joint or heart problems, you should consult your doctor before hiking., You will burn more calories and get a more comprehensive workout if you choose a trail that isn’t completely flat. Instead, aim for a trail with some gain in elevation such as hilly terrain or even a mountain. Hiking uphill is one of the best ways to turn your outdoor adventure into a regular workout., If you want to turn your hike into a workout, you should make sure you’re out hiking for at least 45-60 minutes at a time. This means you can get into a groove at a pace that will allow you to burn some calories while enjoying nature. Depending on the hike you choose and your fitness level, 45-60 minutes of hiking is equivalent to about 2 to 2.5 miles on the trail.

, A surefire way to turn your hiking workout into a search and rescue nightmare is to start out too late in the day. Once the sun goes down, it is easy to get lost. To avoid mishaps that might result in local law enforcement trying to locate you on a rocky hillside, be sure you give yourself plenty of time to complete your hike. A good rule of thumb is to estimate you will cover between one and two miles per hour., Before you decide to turn your hike into a workout, it is critical that you check the weather forecast. If it is forecasted to rain or snow, or if other potentially hazardous weather like high winds is predicted, you should reschedule your hike for another day and head to the gym instead. If you encounter bad weather on your hike, turn around immediately., You don’t need a lot of special gear to go on a hike, but it is important that you are dressed appropriately. Make sure you have comfortable hiking boots or sneakers, clothing appropriate for the weather, and a raincoat in case of inclement weather. You should also take plenty of water and make sure you are wearing sunscreen.

Adjust your bag straps to a comfortable length.,
Cut the nylon straps.,
Fold over the extra inch into a half-inch square.,
Melt the folded area slowly with a cigarette lighter.,
Remove the staples after the nylon has cooled.",How to Shorten Backpack Straps2," The top of the straps should rest comfortably on your shoulders. You should put the backpack on and adjust the straps until the bag fits well, with no sagging below your behind.

, You will need to cut them so there is 1 inch (2.5 cm) of extra nylon sticking out past the plastic adjustment mechanism. Use fabric scissors or kitchen shears to get a clean cut on both straps., Then, staple over the fold about three times. Be careful, as this will leave no room for adjustment in the future! You may want to leave 3-4 inches of strap for future serious backpacking trips.

, Make sure to do this outside as it will result in some smelly fumes that may not be ideal indoors or in an enclosed space.Hold the lighter under the straps and slowly move it back and forth over the straps several times.


The frays of the strap will melt into a single, thicker layer, which is too big to fit through the plastic adjustment mechanism. This will keep the rest of the strap from pulling through the adjustment mechanism.

, Use a staple remover to avoid finger pricks or accidents. Make sure to throw out the staples afterwards.

Put on the backpack and adjust the straps to a comfortable length.,
Place velcro or fastening tape on one end of the strap.,
Fold and secure the straps.",How to Shorten Backpack Straps3," Make sure the backpack is flush to your back and is not sagging past your behind.If you notice there are other straps on your backpack that are unnecessarily long, you can use this method to fold the straps.

, You will need 5-6 inches of fastening tape per strap to ensure it can wrap around the folded strap. Fastening tape is the best option for this method, but you can also use rubber bands, zip ties, or twine., Begin at the end of the straps and roll the straps so they lie flat and even in a bundle. Once the straps have been folded up, secure them with the fastening tape by wrapping the tape around the straps."

Hike at a moderate pace for long period of time.,
Keep your head up and your spine straight.,
Make sure your arms are relaxed.,
Challenge your previous hiking times.,
Consider hiking poles.,
Avoid racing down hills.,
Don’t get distracted by the view.",How to Turn a Hike Into a Workout2," Instead of aiming for a quick, fast-paced hike, you should strive to hike for a longer period of time at a more moderate pace. Hiking at a slower pace means you will be able to stay out longer, and in turn get a longer workout. You should be able to comfortably speak in sentences while hiking. If you can’t carry on a conversation with a friend, your pace might be a little too fast and you should slow down a bit., This is especially important when you are hiking up hill. If you lean forward when you are on an incline, you can add unnecessary stress to your spine. This, in turn, can cause you to tire more quickly. Instead opt to keep your head facing forward and in line with a straight neck and spine., You can keep a slight bend at your elbows while you hike. You should also feel free to swing your arms slightly. Beware, however, of swinging them excessively across your midline as this can lead to wasting energy., A great way to turn your hike into a workout is to challenge yourself to beat your old records. For example, if you hiked your favorite trail in 60 minutes last week, try challenging yourself to complete the hike in 55 minutes. However, you should always pay attention to your body and not overdo it if you start feeling pain or fatigue.

, Hiking poles, also called trekking poles, can help you make the most of your hike. The poles help distribute your weight evenly and give your arms an added workout. They also add the benefit of taking some of the pressure off your knees and hips., It’s easy to want to race down a hill after a steep, laborious climb to the top of a mountain or vista. You should, however, resist this temptation. If you give into the momentum, you could end up crashing down the hill. Instead, try to keep a pace similar to the one you rocked moving up the incline., When you’re working out in nature, it is easy to get swept away by the beauty of it all. If you’re trying to turn your workout into a hike, this could deter you from reaching your fitness goals. While it’s okay to stop and soak in the scenery occasionally during your workout, try to limit these detours and stay focused on your pace and end goal.

Lunge up slight inclines.,
Sink into a squat.,
Stop and do a set of jumping jacks.,
Try a hill repeat.",How to Turn a Hike Into a Workout3," When you are walking up slight to moderate inclines, consider lunging instead of taking regular steps. Slow, controlled lunges can help power up the muscles in your legs. This, in turn, can help you burn more calories and really boost the workout benefits of a hike., Chances are you will encounter trees during your hike. You can use a tree to help balance yourself as you sink into a squat. Grab the tree trunk, and bend your knees until you are squatting. Pulse in the squat for 60 seconds, and then rise. Repeat several times and then continue on your hike., Adding exercises to your hike can boost your workout potential, and doing some jumping jacks is a great way to keep your heart rate up. After you make it to the top of an incline, try doing a set of 10-20 jumping jacks before continuing on your journey.

, If you want to burn more calories on your hike, you can challenge yourself to repeat an incline. Hiking up a hill twice, instead of once, will up the ante on your hiking workout. When you reach the top of an incline, try turning around, going back down the hill, and then hiking up a second time.

Gather tips on the Trail.,
Decide on a hike length.,
Map your route.,
Have a contingency plan.,
Arrange transportation.,
Invest in good backpack.,
Get pack accessories.,
Pack food and drink.,
Include cooking gear.,
Assemble your clothing.,
Gather sleeping gear.,
Carry a first aid kit.,
Consider additional gear.",How to Prepare for Hiking the Appalachian Trail," This may be the first time you’re hiking or doing part of the Appalachian Trail. Gathering tips from friends or others who have hiked the path or parts of it can help you plot an optimal route for your needs and wishes. For example, it may allow you to make a detour to a cool site or great restaurant or know the best places to venture off the trail for lodging or food.


Get yourself an official guide to the Appalachian Trail. It’s always a good idea to have a trail-specific guide with you in book form. They often contain maps and tips and can be very useful if you have questions or need something and don’t have access to a computer or cell phone data.Look at online guides from different sites including the Appalachian Trail Conservancy and Trip Advisor. These sites often offer great additional tips that may not be in a book. You can also take copies of these tips with you or even photograph them with a tablet or smartphone for lighter bulk in your gear.
Ask any friends or family members who have hiked the Trail for tips. They may also have friends who can offer advice on having the best experience.;
, Before you can map your course, you’ll need to decide on how long you want to hike the Appalachian Trail. Not everyone has the time or conditioning to do the whole trail and these factors should help you decide on the appropriate length.


Do the entire length of the trail if you have 5-7 months free. In addition, you should also be in excellent physical and mental condition as a hike of this length can test the reserves of even the strongest people.Try a shorter hike if you don’t have as much time or aren’t in optimal condition. One of the great things about the Appalachian Trail is that you can do easy section hikes that range anywhere from two days to two weeks.Go for a day hike if you just want to get out an enjoy nature, don’t have a lot of time, or aren’t in the best condition. Remember, even though the Appalachian Trail isn’t Mt. Everest, a day hike will still require that you walk at a higher elevation for more than a few hours.

, Once you’ve decided on the length of your hike, you’ll need a general idea of the route you want to follow. The Appalachian Trail is a great option because it is a marked path for the entire distance and won’t require a lot of navigation skills.However, you should always have an idea of where your going and what amenities you may need on your path.


Look at the map of the trail to get a good idea of the different sections. Consulting the Appalachian Trail Conservancy and other guides can give you a good idea of the length of each section. Depending on your conditioning and experience, you can figure 7-12 miles a day. Less experienced and well-conditioned hikers should plan to hike no more than 7-8 miles per day, which will allow for time to rest and take in nature.Consider factors such as overnight stays, buying supplies, and potential emergencies when mapping your route. If you are doing a longer hike that requires overnights, plan to stay at campsites, shelters, or in bigger towns that have hotels. You’ll also need make sure you map places with water sources as well as where you can buy food and other supplies.

, Weather and other emergencies can force you to alter your plans to hike on the Appalachian Trail. Having an alternative plan for your hike can prevent mishaps and injuries as well as allow you to enjoy the trail even if conditions are optimal.


Think about the time of year you are planning to hike. The East Coast is prone to extreme changes in weather and your hike may encounter floods, mud, snow, or even insect plagues.You might consider changing the section you hike or direction of your route depending on the time of year.
Make sure your contingency plan includes what to do in case of a physical emergency such as a leg or arm break or a serious case of the flu.

, You’ll need to arrive at and depart from the Appalachian Trail. Day-hikers may arrive by car and park in a designed trail lot. But thru-hikers or multi-day hikers will need transportation to and from the trail. Arranging transportation with friends or family or even local infrastructure can help you have a more enjoyable hike.


Consult the Appalachian Trail’s interactive map to locate parking options and their proximity to trailheads.Schedule an A.T. Shuttle one to two weeks in advance of your arrival. Each section has different shuttle providers, the information for which is available at http://www.appalachiantrail.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/at-shuttlesb175de6668ce6efcb07bff000057c13a.pdf?sfvrsn=0. Consider scheduling a shuttle at the beginning of your walk so that you can walk back to your car without being set on a rigid schedule.
Consider accessing the Appalachian Trail by rail, bus, and air services, especially if you’re going on a longer hike. You may need to schedule a shuttle in conjunction with these types of transport, but it will spare you leaving your car in one spot for a longer period of time., A good-quality backpack that is not damaged is key to having a good hike. If you have a pack or need one, it’s important to make sure that it has a volume that can fit your gear and provide you comfort.Make sure your pack size is right for your expected travel time. You can easily carry a pack of less than 40 liters (2400 cubic inches) for a day hike, one of 40-70 liters for a 2-4 day trip (2400-4200 cubic inches), and at least 70 liters (4200 cubic inches) for journeys of 5 days or longer.
Recognize that style is less important than fit when it comes to comfort. You want about 80% of your pack weight carried by your hips. Your pack should have chest and hip straps to help offset the strain of pack weight on your shoulders. Ask a professional at an outdoor store if you have questions about the best pack and fits for your body.

, Different types of pack accessories can help you organize your gear and keep it dry. Consider getting the following accessories to help you have a more comfortable hike:


Pack cover to keep your pack and gear dry if it is raining
Pack liners to keep liquids in your pack from seeping
Packing cells to let you separate and organize your gear inside the pack
Waterproof bags or containers to keep electronics and/ or clothing dry, No matter how long you plan to hike the Appalachian Trail, you’ll need to pack some food and water. You’ll be burning about 5,000 calories a day. Having even a small supply on hand can ensure that you keep your blood sugar at a stable rate and your body hydrated. In addition, it can help you survive accidents or other emergencies.Invest in a water bladder. This is the easiest and most environmentally friendly way to carry and drink water. You can get a bladder, which comes in various sizes and will fit in your pack, at an outdoor store.Get water treatment tabs to make water safe for drinking. The Appalachian Trail has different water sources along the entire path, including springs and streams. However, these are often rife with pathogens that can cause serious illness. You can get different types and flavors of water treatment tabs at outdoor stores.Pack enough food for at least two days if you are doing a day hike; a supply of 4-7 days for multi-day hikes; and more for longer sections. Aim to pack lightweight and non-bulky foods that offer high amounts of energy such as dehydrated refried beans, rice, and noodles. Include snacks that you can munch on throughout the day such as energy bars, jerky, or candy bars. You can also get powdered beverages including coffee and sports drinks.
Make sure your route plan includes stop to refuel at restaurants or local grocery stores. This will also give you a chance to get fresh fruits and vegetables, even if just for a daily treat.
Get some garbage bags in which to throw away packaging, food or other items. The Appalachian Trail has a Leave No Trace policy, which includes not leaving any trash. You can get rid of trash at designated sites or when you buy supplies.

, If you plan to cook on multi-day or thru hikes, you’ll need gear with which to cook your meals. You may have cooking gear or may need to buy some, which you can get at a local outdoor store. You should have the following items to cook any food on the Appalachian Trail:


Multi-fuel camping stove
Fuel
Matches or a lighter
Cookware including a lightweight pot, pan, and lid
Plate, mug, bowl; remember that you can always use a mug as a bowl to cut down on weight
Utensils
Dish soap and sponge, though many people just use water, The best principle for packing clothing that will keep you warm and comfortable is layering. Having clothing that you can layer will keep you warm or cool and dry. Avoid cotton items, which don’t wick moisture. Instead, try synthetic or merino wool materials. The following clothing items can help keep you comfy as you journey along the Appalachian Trail:


Base layer to wick moisture from your body or insulate you even when it’s wet outside
Middle layer like a fleece or down jacket/ sweater; sometimes called the “soft shell”
Third layer that is weather and windproof; often called the “hard shell”
Hat
Gloves
Hiking pants or shorts; legs that zip off are an excellent option
Underwear

Learn the basics.,
Look for a fish 30–60 centimeters (11.8–23.6 in) in length.,
Learn the difference between silver, white, and common bream.,
Familiarize yourself with the American species of bream.,
Check for local varieties of bream.",How to Fish For Bream1," The common bream is a deep-bodied, medium-sized fish, that is bronze in color. The fins of the common bream are dark brown, with a tail that's deeply forked. Younger fish are a silvery color that deepens with age.The common bream is a member of the same family as carp, so if you know how to identify a carp you'll be looking for a similar fish. It's a bottom-feeder, preying primarily on worms, snails and pea mussels throughout ponds, lakes and slow-moving rivers.;
, Between spawning and maturity, the bream will grow to a size of between 30 and 60 centimeters (1-2 feet long), though it can become quite larger on occasion. Bream are extremely common, putting them in the lowest-priority of conservation risk, though bream need to be large enough to catch legally.


European guidelines and American guidelines will vary widely by region and season, so it's important that you find out the local guidelines in your area to determine size-minimums for the fish you catch. In general, if it's 30 centimeter (11.8 in) long, you'll be fine.

, Bream frequently breed with other species of fish, making the identification somewhat difficult on occasion. If you're on the lookout for a specific species of fish, for some reason, you'll want to be able to quickly identify the common bream or the American bream, and distinguish it from the other varieties.


Silver and white bream are somewhat smaller than the common bream, featuring an iridescent effect in the scales that isn't found in the common bream. If the fish is glistening below the water line, it's likely that you've got the silver or the white bream.
It's not critically important to determine the difference between all the sub-species and the cross-species of bream to catch some good panfish, as long as you're sure you're in the general neighborhood. Count the scales from the dorsal to the lateral line to get a quick check on the bream. There should be 11 or more scales in the line. Fewer, and it's another variety of bream., Again, to clarify, American bream aren’t technically bream, but some species of sunfish are locally and colloquially referred to as “bream.” The word identifies several distinct species of fish.The members of the sunfish family most commonly identified as bream include:


Bluegill, which are named for their gill coloring, bluegills can be found in most parts of the United States, except Alaska. The 1950 world record bluegill weighed 4 pounds, 12 ounces (2.15 kg).
Redear sunfish are similar to bluegill in appearance, except that their gills are red instead of blue. They are found primarily in the southeast, but have been introduced elsewhere in the country, although not as widely as the bluegill. The world record for redear sunfish is 5 pounds, 7.5 ounces (2.48 kg).
Redbreast sunfish. Redbreast sunfish bear their red coloring on their breasts and bellies instead of their ears, although some members of this species substitute rust or yellow coloring for the bright red. Alternate names for this species include ""longear,"" ""red perch,"" ""robin,"" ""tobacco box,"" ""yellowbelly,"" and ""yellowbreast."" They can be found in brackish marshes, warm ponds, and cold creeks, but they are not as widely distributed as bluegill or redear sunfish.

, Other species of bream include banded sunfish, green sunfish, orange spotted sunfish, Ozark bass, rock bass, and warmouth. Check with your state's Department of Natural Resources or Fish and Game Commission to see which species of bream inhabit the waters of your state.

"
"
Head inland.,
Try your luck at sunrise or sunset.,
Look for areas warmed by sunlight.,
Avoid the current.,
Seek out appropriate cover.,
Fish between April and June.,
Learn the specifics of the species.",How to Fish For Bream2," In both Europe and the United States, where different species of bream are found, fishing for freshwater bream will be a very similar process. You'll want to head inland to find relatively shallow and still lake, river, or pond waters where bream are common. In the US, species of bream are common through the south and the Midwest, while European bream are most common in England, Wales, and Scotland.


Look for rivers with plenty of switch-backs and coves that are good for feeding. Very weedy or reeded lakes and ponds are also common habitats for bream of all varieties. Anywhere with shallow, sun-filled water and plenty of cover is a likely home for bream.

, Bream and most other freshwater fish are crepuscular feeders, meaning that they become active in the hours during the sun coming up and going down. Mornings and evenings can often be the best times to catch bream, when they'll be out and hungry. Try to get out on the water before the sun starts its movement, so you'll be set up and in place for the feeding that will happen.

, Sunfish are so named because they seek areas of lakes, ponds, and streams that have been warmed by the rays of the sun. Sunny banks with deep water nearby are great places to look for bream.


European bream are bottom-feeders, less likely to be easily identifiable from above, though they still favor the same kinds of environments that American bream favor. Look for calm areas of water with favorable cover from above.

, Although bream like to have wind and water currents sweep their food to them, they like to position themselves just outside those currents when feeding and shallow coves protected from wind and wave when spawning. Look for still places and little coves where freshwater fish feed.

, As with many other species, bream like to have some form of cover nearby, either to hide from predators or prey or to shade themselves from the sun's light. What type of cover you should look for depends on what kind of water you are fishing for bream in.


In lakes and ponds, look for weeds, lily pads, brush, timber, rip-rap (gravel), or rocks. If the lake has a boat dock, try it as well.In streams, look for any of the same cover as in lakes or ponds, as well as undercut banks, particularly those that offer deep pools just outside the flow of the current.

, Bream spawn during the late spring, which makes the months April, May, and June make excellent months for bagging bream. When spawning, bream prefer gravel or sandy bottoms, although they will spawn on silt-covered muddy bottoms if sand or gravel is not available. Sand tends to collect where water flows into or out of a lake or where the current slows to a stop.


When bream spawn, they sometimes give off an odor something like a mixture of watermelon (or other fruit) and fresh fish. This smell can help you narrow down where to fish once you have established the right water warmth, current, and cover conditions.

, Some species prefer one kind of cover over another. For instance, redear sunfish and redbreast sunfish normally prefer to hug the bottom, although redbreasts can sometimes be taken on the surface or halfway to the bottom.


Take advantage of the expertise available at the local bait shop. Whether you're in your hometown or fishing far from home, talk to those who are most familiar with the fishing in the area. Fish change their habits depending on the season and the area, and it's the locals who know best. A good angler might want to keep the best spots sacred, but might be willing to share some info on good bait for the season, or for the area.

Use a light spinning or spincast rod and matching reel.,
Use small bait.,
Use a bobber or a spinner.",How to Fish For Bream3," Although bream can approach 6 pounds (2.72 kg) in size, most bream are less than 1 pound (0.45 kg), which means you can get away with a relatively light set-up. You can best enjoy fishing for bream with light or ultralight tackle, with a spinning or spincast rod from 5 to 6 feet (1.5 to 1.8 m) in length and a reel designed to handle from 2 to 8 pound test (1 to 4 kg class) line.


You can also do a decent job with a cane pole of 4 to 6 feet (1.2 to 1.8 m) in length with an 8- foot (2.4 m) or longer line tied to its tip. Fly fishermen can also fish for bream using a 3- or 4-weight rod and matching line.

, While large baits and lures are appropriate for large fish such as bass, walleye, and pike, small baits and lures are appropriate for panfish such as common bream, bluegill, redbreast, and redear sunfish. Fishing for bream with corn and maggots is also common.If you prefer live bait, crickets and grasshoppers work best, but where they're not available, try red worms or pieces of nightcrawlers in warmer weather and wax worms or grubs in colder weather. Use long-shanked size 8 or size 10 hooks and weight the bait with a light sinker. Attach a small slip bobber to your line.If you prefer artificial bait and fish with a spinning or spincast rod, try tiny jigs such as the Lindy Little Nipper or the Bass Buster Beetle in weights from 1/32 to 1/16 ounce (0.89 to 1.78 g). If you fly-fish for bream, try small poppers, rubber-legged nymphs, or foam-bodied spiders.

, Lure-fishing for bream is commonly done with the use of a bobber, as well. You can fish leisurely and slowly by using a small slip bobber, or more quickly with an attached safety-pin spinner, such as the Bass Buster Beetle Spin. Experiment with several colors to find which one works for you on a given day, in the environment in which you're fishing.

Choose a date, time, entry fee, and location.,
Decide on a tournament format.,
Canvass businesses for prizes.,
Create and distribute flyers advertising the tournament.",How to Run a Fishing Tournament1," Early Saturdays or Sundays are the best times to start a fishing tournament, since you’ll have the largest number of entrants available. Additionally, the right location can make the difference between non-stop action and a boring day. Talking to local fishermen can help determine the best location for a fishing tournament, though there’s no foolproof way to ensure the fish will be biting on competition day.;
, Here, you can be as creative as you like:


Some tournaments reward anglers for catching the biggest fish of the day. This would be easy enough to track, as it would only require a quick weigh at the end of the competition. Prizes could be awarded for the three biggest entries, or could be divided into fish types (bass, trout, sunfish or others).
Other competitions measure success by the number of fish caught, or the total weight of the daily catch. Traditional bass tournaments operate this way. The tournament is timed, and entrants may bring back whatever they catch in the allotted time. Another more fish-friendly way would be to limit to a fixed number of fish, so that when an angler reaches the maximum he is forced to release a fish the moment he catches another.
There is also the option of “tagging” fish by catching ones yourself, then tagging them before releasing them back into the lake. Anyone catching a “tagged” fish would then earn a special prize.

, Only the largest tournaments can secure sponsors willing to load up the prize table for free. Running a smaller fishing tournament requires some legwork, though you can always put some of the entry fee toward cash or other prizes. But since no entry fee has been collected yet, the best way to secure prizes is to visit as many businesses as possible and ask for giveaways.

, Make sure you include as many details as possible, including the date, time, entry fee, location and format. Making the flyer as colorful as possible will draw attention to it. Scan the flyer into your computer and provide links to it through whichever social media sites you frequent. Post the event on message boards. The more time you spend promoting your event, the greater the turnout will be.

Thread your line through your lure.,
Wind the line back around itself.,
Tuck the free-end of the line back through.,
Fasten the knot.",How to Set Up a Fishing Pole," A fishing rod can be a complex piece of equipment so it is wise to learn the terminology before assembling your own. If your rod breaks into 2 parts or more, the joint where the sections fit together is called the ferrule. The male ferrule inserts into a female ferrule.The handle is also called a grip and is where you hold the rod.
The butt it the thick part of your rod closest to the handle. The tip is the most flexible part of the rod and is located at the very top of the rod.
Guides are the rings that go all along the rod that guide your fishing line.;
, Wipe both pieces down with a cloth to remove any dirt or debris that could scratch it. Use necessary, use a cotton swab to clean the female ferrule.By keeping the rod clean, you’ll extend the life of it. Dirt can scratch and destroy the pieces that hold the rod together.








, Align the female and male pieces on a flat service. Holding the female ferrule securely, anchor the male ferrule around it. Always ensure that if necessary, any guides to help secure the ferrules are properly aligned.








If your rod is not coming together, stop immediately. Look at the instructions. Is there a locking mechanism of any sort you’re missing? If you force the rod together, you risk damaging it permanently.
On most rods you will need to rotate the pieces together. Do this by holding the female ferrule and rotating the male piece while they are adjoined.This will lock in your rod.

, While looking at the bottom of your rod, you should see a female opening to insert your reel. This is called the reel seat. Insert your reel.Now put the reel seat, which acts like a smooth handle, over the butt end of the reel. It will thread onto the reel. Rotate until the pieces all feel secure.









Be cautious not to over tighten the reel. If you force the threading to turn past what it is built for, it can crack and ruin the rod.Remember with threading that right is tight and left is loose. When looking at your rod from the back end, threading right will tighten it. In other words, rotating clockwise will tighten the thread, while rotating counter-clockwise will loosen it.

, The bale arm is the silver overhead piece on the reel. When applying a small amount of pressure, you will be able to flip it up to the other side of the reel. After lifting the bale arm, you will be able to pull the edge of the thread and the reel will unravel it.








Use caution here. If the bale does not lift easily, you may be looking at the wrong piece. You should never have to strong-arm your bale up.
Check that the spool of line unwinds the same direction as the reel turns. If they do not match, you’ll have unnecessary twists and knots. If they are not the same direction, simple flip the spool to have the directions match., Most rods have four to five guides, or eyelets, attached to the rod. Starting at the eyelet closest to the reel, thread it with the line starting at the bottom and coming out of the top. Work your way up to the top of the rod.








, To close the arm, simply flip it the opposite direction as you previously moved it.To test that it is closed, gently pull the line. No more line should come out.









Test the direction of the spool again by reeling in a small amount of line. If the reel does not rotate the same direction as the spool you’ll need to start over after fixing the direction of the spool., Depending on the sun and cloud cover, you may want to pick a different lure. On sunny days, try using a silver lure. The silver will help reflect light and attracts attention.Contrastingly, use a gold lure on a cloudy day. Gold has high reflective properties and will help give off light on an overcast or stormy day., Pick your lure style based off what kind of fish you are aiming to catch and where. If you’re fishing in freshwater, try a jig. A jig will work well in fresh water by using feathers and a metal head to attract fish.A spoon lure will work well for fish that prey on small fish. The spoon will wave back and forth to mimic the movement of a fleeing fish, attracting the bigger predators.If you’re looking for an all-purpose lure, try a spinner. A spinner is a metal piece that will spin in the water as it moves. This attracts a lot of attention and should be used in a particularly difficult-to-catch location., If your water is muddy or dirty, you’ll need a lure that makes a lot of moment, such as a spinner or a spoon.These lures create vibrations, so even if the fish cannot see the lure, they can feel it. Comparatively, if the water is clear, an overwhelming amount of vibration and movement may scare off a fish.







, Once you’ve threaded the lure onto your line, leave approximately ten inches, or twenty centimetres, of line on the other side of the lure.








Since fishing line is so difficult to see, it is often recommend that you practice knot tying with string or shoelaces.

, While your line and lure and laying on the ground, pull the free end of the line back up towards the rest of the line. Loosely wrap the end of the line around the line on the other side of the lure, similar to how a candy cane would have two colors wrapped around another.Stop once you have wound the lines together approximately five times.








, Taking the end of your line, pull it back towards the lure. Next, loop it through the first, big loop, that contains the line. After you loop it through, tuck it once more within itself, so it is coming underneath the line. 







, Hold the line, as well as the end of the line. Pull them slowly together. This should make the line coil tightly where it has been wrapped, and create a tight knot at the lure.You may need to help the process along by using your fingernails to shuffle the twists down towards the lure. Once the knot is wrapped tightly, clip the excess off the end.









To correctly wind the knot down, you may find you need to moisten the line. This can be done by moistening your fingertips with saliva and running the line over your finger."

Choose your lure.,
Add a lure.,
Bait a fishing line.,
Cast out.,
Reel in your fish.",How to Use a Fishing Rod1," Lures are great for beginners because they are less messy than live bait. They also cover a lot of water and are more efficient when targeting specific types of fish. While lures can get caught on debris and be relatively expensive but should be used depending on the type of fish and water conditions. Choose the type of lure based on these basic principles:


Jigs are the most versatile lures. They require the most skill as you must cast it out and wait until it falls to the bottom of the water before retrieve it to induce a strike with its movement. Feeling the strike can be difficult as jigs may get caught on debris or just feel like their moving along with the current.
Spinners are also great for beginners because you simply have to cast and retrieve. They are designed to create a spinning action that can vibrate through murky water and entice a bite.
Spoons are designed so that they create a side-to-side wobble upon retrieval that mimics injured prey fish. You can vary the speed of the wobble by slowing down your retrieval.
Soft plastic baits are meant to mimic live bait. They will resemble critters like worms, crawfish, or frogs. Depending on the type of plastic bait, simply mimic the movement of the critter that it resembles.
Flies are exactly as they sound. They are meant to mimic insect hovering at the surface of the water. They require quite a lot of skill to produce a natural movement that fish will be attracted to.;
, Tie your line to your reel using an Arbor knot. Tie your lure, hook, or fly using either a Unit knot, Improved clinch knot, or Palomar knot. You may also try a Surgeon’s knot to tie two lines together or a Surgeon’s End Loop to add a pre-made snelled hook.Tie an Arbor knot by using the tag end of your line to wrap around the arbor end of your spool. Then take the standing part with the tag end and tie an overhand knot, much like you would when starting to tie a shoelace. Move a couple inches and tie another overhand knot from the tag end. You want the first knot to slide down to the spool as you pull the standing part of the line to butt the second knot against it. Close the tag end by trimming the line.The Uni knot is the easiest tackle knot. Thread your line through your hook and make sure it is parallel to the standing line as you double back. Lay the tag end over the double line to create a loop. Take the tag end around the double line six time and through the loop. Pull the tag end to ensure the turns are snug. Push the knot down towards the eye to finish.The Improved clinch knot is the most popular knot used to fish. Place the line through your hook and create 5 or more turns as you double back around the standing line. Take the end of the line and thread it back through the first loop behind the eye of the hook and thread it through the large loop you just created. Tighten the coils by pulling on the tag end. Push the knot tight against the eye and snip the tag end closed.The Palomar knot is considered to be the strongest knot. Fold 6 inches of line to create double the thickness and thread the loop end through your hook. Tie an overhand knot loosely keeping the hook at the bottom, letting it hang. Use your thumb and forefinger to hold the knot as you pass the loop over your hook. Move the loop so that it is above the eye of the hook. Simultaneously pull both the tag end and the standing line to tighten the knot onto the eye of your hook. Trip the tag end closed., Choosing live bait will depend on the type of fish. The size of your hook will also be determined by the size of the fish that you’re to catch. Basically, thread your hook through your bait at 2 points to secure it from falling off or at the thick portion closest to its head. You want to place your hook at the head and through a thick portion of the body. For example, if you are using a worm thread your hook close to the head and tail.


If you are using fish as bait, make sure that the hook goes through the head and jaw because that will be the primary strike point of your fish.
Choosing a good bait depends on the type of fish and type of water. For example, if you’re fishing for freshwater fish in rivers, crawfish and worms may be a good choice for bait.

, Casting can be done depending on the weather conditions and the location. While there are a variety of techniques, it will take practice to get your cast efficient and consistent. Choose these methods based on the distance you’re hoping to achieve:


An overhead cast is best used when you want a lot of distance. Hold down the button for the casting reel with your thumb as you bring the rod back. In a single motion propel the rod forward and release your thumb. Push the button again to prevent your line from tangling by slowing down your spool.
Pitching should be employed when you are trying to cast close at about the 10 yard range. Let out some slack line by holding your rod up and making the lure move down to meet the reel. Using your non-dominant hand, grab the lure. Use your dominant hand to press the button on your reel. Keep your line taut as you bring the lure back and drop the tip of the rod. In a single swooping motion, raise the tip of the rod to pull the lure from your non-dominant hand. Use your thumb to slow down the line to ensure you don’t go past your short distance.

, There are a variety of different reels that you can purchase but the 3 basics are the spincaster, baitcaster, and spinning reel.Most people start with the spincaster. It is a push-button reel that is simple enough to let you focus on casting technique.Baitcaster is also a push-button reel but gives you more control as the button locks in place once pushed down. It requires you to use your thumb on the spool to control the speed of the lure. This reel works well when trying to get fish out of thick water.Spinning reels have an open-face and the rod will be parallel to their spools of line. These work well when casting light crankbaits, drop-shot rigs, jerkbaits, and weightless soft plastics."

Pick the area that you want to fish.,
Slow to a trolling speed.,
Grab the line (beyond the tip) in one hand, and grab the line release clip in the other.",How to Use a Downrigger Setup1," Around 80 feet (24.4 m) deep is a good place to start. It is a smart idea to fish an area with a fairly flat bottom with no obstructions (such as trees, rocks).

, Switch your reel to “free-spin” (allows to reel to spin freely, releasing line) by releasing the drag clicker. Put your lure into the water and allow it to feed out about twenty feet. Lock the drag clicker to stop your line and put your rod in the holder.

, Clip the line release clip onto the line (there should be a mark on the clip to show where to clip it on) then lower the cannonball into the water.

Research the species of stonefly found where you plan to go fly fishing.,
Choose flies that mimic the appearance of the stoneflies active in the area.,
Fish nymph flies just after the stoneflies they imitate hatch.,
Fish dry fly stonefly imitations while stoneflies are laying their eggs.",How to Use a Stonefly When Fly Fishing," The order Plecoptera is divided into 7 families, with the families Perlidae and Perlodidae being the 2 most common across North America. The stonefly species of these families, such as the golden stonefly, medium brown stonefly, and yellow stonefly, as well as those of the family Chloroperlidae measure as large as 1 1/2 inches (40 mm). In contrast, the stoneflies of the families Capniidae (the snowfly), Leuctridae (the needlefly), Nemouridae (the forestfly), and Taeniopterygidae (the black stonefly) measure from 0.15 to 1/2 inch (4 to 12 mm). Stoneflies of the smaller families tend to hatch in early spring, while the larger species hatch later in the year.


You can find out which species of stonefly are found in the area you're going to fish from its state or provincial game or fish division, the entomology department of a university in the area, or their respective websites.;
, Many flies tied for fly fishing for trout are designed to ""match the hatch"" of whatever insect the fish happen to be feeding on. Dry and wet flies designed to mimic stoneflies include the Black King Stone Nymph, the Brown Montana Stone, the Golden Ugly Bug, and the Little King Stone Nymph. In most, but not all, cases, the wet fly nymph will be smaller than the dry fly representing the adult, with sizes ranging from as small as #16 and #18 for little green stoneflies to as large as #2 for American salmonflies.

, Stonefly nymphs are equipped with gills to extract oxygen from water and remain underwater until the time they mature into adults, when the nymphs crawl out of the water onto shoreline objects they cling to them using the double claws on their feet. Just as most adult stoneflies are awkward fliers, stonefly nymphs are generally poor swimmers. While most stoneflies hatch in the spring, some of the larger species have 2- or even 3-year life cycles, allowing you to fish stonefly nymphs almost year-round with success.


In most cases, artificial stonefly nymphs should be fished close to the bottom, with 4 inches (10 cm), ideally on the edge of where the current changes. Have several weights of stonefly nymphs with you to allow for variations in current strength. If you add weight to the line, add it 4 to 5 inches (10 to 12.5 cm) ahead of the fly so that it tumbles more naturally in the current.
You can fish some artificial nymphs on droppers behind egg patterns; the eggs attract the fish's attention, but once it sees the fly, it attacks that instead of the ""egg.""
You can detect when stoneflies have molted by the presence of ""shucks"" (shed skins) on rocks, weeds, bushes, and tree trunks on the shore near the water. During molting is another good time to fish artificial stonefly nymphs, particularly around sundown.
When fishing a stonefly nymph, cast upstream, let the fly sink, and then retrieve it slowly by hand, allowing the current to push it around.

, Female stoneflies, which are larger than the males, typically lay their small, black eggs by hovering over the water in a near-vertical position and dropping (ovipositing) them into the nesting site, although some species land on or dive into the water to lay their eggs. Ovipositing is a strenuous activity, often leaving the females drained and drifting on the surface.


Two places to fish dry flies are in faster water during the commotion created by the act of many female stoneflies laying their eggs and in the slack water that females spent from laying their eggs drift into, particularly during early summer months.

Choose the right length.,
Decide on the right material.,
Match your line with your rod and spool.,
Use tip-ups instead of a rod.,
Use both tip-ups and a spinning rod to increase your chances.,
Settle on the correct bait.",How to Use a Fishing Rod2," Ice fishing rods are typically shorter than freshwater or saltwater rods. They vary in length from 24 - 36 inches. You will need to choose the size of your rod based on the thickness of the ice and type of fish that you are fishing for., Ice fishing requires a very sensitive rod. Fish are not very active in cold water so you need a rod that is both able to withstand the harsh weather conditions and be flexible and sensitive enough to indicate when you have a bite. Look for graphite or fiberglass rods.The type of fish that you are planning to catch will also determine how sensitive and flexible you want your rod. For example, panfish require a rod that is very light whereas game fish, like Northern pike, need a heavier rod.

, Choose a spinning reel or a spring tension spool with a line to match your rod. For example, if you are using a lightweight rod, use a lightweight line. You may also use a fly reel instead of a spinning reel.A fly reel has less line to twist relative to the spinning reel.

, A tip-up is a device that dangles bait beneath the ice. It lets you know when a bite happens with a flag set above the ice. The device is similar to a rod in that it uses a reel that is submerged under water. A fish takes the bait and turns the reel which releases the flag to signal that you have a strike.Tip-ups are usually made of wood and some are circular to fit over your hole and prevent it from freezing over. Use a heavy line when using a tip-up with braided line for larger fish like walleye.

, Setup two holes at different locations. Make sure the locations are close enough for you to react in case you have two bites but far enough that they give more opportunities for multiple strikes. Use your spinning rod to jig in one hole as your monitor your tip up.Jigging means that use a special device -- a jig -- to produce a jerking up and down motion as it moves through the water. The jerking motion is meant to illicit the strike reflex of certain types of fish.

, Both live and artificial baits will work for ice fishing. For artificial baits you may choose banana jigs, and teardrop jigs. For live bait you may try worms, bee mother larva, maggots, fly larvae, mayfly larvae, or minnows. Slowly jig the bait for whichever bait you choose."
"
Choose a rod based on what you’re fishing and the location.,
Employ spinning rods for still fishing with live bait or for trolling.,
Work bait-casting and closed-spin casting rods.,
Fish with telescopic fishing rods for larger fish.",How to Use a Fishing Rod3," Rods vary in width, flexibility, and length. Flexibility is known as action and rods must have enough to absorb the tension of the type of fish that you are catching once it strikes. If you’re fishing at a location with a lot of debris than you must choose a rod able to withstand movement through the debris.Fiberglass fishing rods are best paired with crank baits, jerk baits, reaction baits, and treble hooks.
Carbon-fiber fishing rods are great if you are a professional level fisherman as they work best with precision casting.
To get more fight out of bigger fish or when casting for smaller ones, use an ultra-light fishing rod for more flex. These rods usually range from 4 - 5.5 feet in length and are paired best with casting lures and flies to catch crappie, trout, bass, bluegill, and other panfish.

, Choose spinning rods made from graphite or fiberglass with a cork or PVC foam handle. Choose a length between 5 - 8.5 feet when fishing bass, trout, pike and walleye. Longer spinning rods should be used when casting with two hands for fish including steelhead and salmon.The spinning reel hangs under the rod unlike bait casting or spin casting rods.

, These rods work best when using fishing reels that are mounted above the handle. Made of graphite or fiberglass with a cork or pvc foam handle, these rods are very similar to spinning rods. They can be anywhere from 5 - 8.5 feet in length. Use longer rods with a longer grip for two-handed casting when fishing steelhead or salmon.


Use larger rods when fishing with larger bait and for larger fish.

, Designed to either shorten or expand, telescopic rods range anywhere from 20 - 30 feet in length but can be collapsed down to as short as 1.5 feet. Choose telescopic rods made out of graphite, fiberglass, or composite material to ensure both durability and flexibility. Each section is designed to fit into another section while keeping the structural integrity of the rod.Telescopic rods are meant for easy transport. Make sure you follow proper maintenance procedures including using tip covers for each section of the rod when transporting. The sections should close easier if they are shorter in length. More sections translate into better weight and stress distribution that can create a farther cast and less breakage when you are involved with a stronger fish.

"
"
Consider the length, power and action of your rod.,
Utilize a spinning rod and reel when casting lighter lures and baits.,
Employ baitcasting rods and reels.,
Work a saltwater trolling rod for larger fish.,
Use saltwater jigging rods and reels.",How to Use a Fishing Rod4," These factors will be based on the type of fish that you want to catch. Short rods provide power for fish that give more fight while longer rods cast further. The power of a rod is how much weight in can lift, from light to extra heavy. Rods can also be chosen based on the weight of the lure or the pound-test line that they are designed to be paired with.


Choose a graphite rod if you want a stiff yet sensitive experience and a fiberglass rod for a tough and powerful one.Reels are classified as high or low speed where the latter is used when needing more power to fight large fish. Some reels allow you to push a button to switch between high and low speed.

, Spinning rod and reels work well with top-water poppers and high-speed plugs. Use your dominant hand to hold the rod as you use your other hand to crank the handle.Make sure you change the handle of your rod depending on which is your dominant hand.
Spool the line by laying the rod on the floor and ensure that the line is going onto the reel at the same direction that the line is leaving the spool. Pinch the line and crank the reel handle a dozen times. With a slack line, drop the tip of the rod to check if the line starts to twist and spin. If it does, you have spooled the line in the wrong direction. Flip the spool over and continue in the right direction as you fill the reel.

, These rods work best when bottom fishing, jigging, long casting, or when using big baits. Use an open-face reel for casing or jigging to let out and retrieve the line quickly. Use a closed face reel when using lighter lures and baits. Make sure to use your thumb to control the speed of the spool and keep it slow.Baitcasting rods easily get tangled because the spool turns faster than the line as it leaves the rod. If the tangle isn’t too bad you may be able to untangle it by pulling more line off the reel. However, most baitcasting reel have either a centrifugal, magnetic, or electronic cast control to keep your line from getting tangled.

, Saltwater trolling rods carry a lot of line and their large bodies allow them to take extreme pressure for fighting large fish. These rods are shorter and stronger than casting rods. They may also come with a notched butt for a fighting belt or chair. Rods that are longer with a short butt are meant for use with a fighting belt or chair.Pair the rod with an appropriate line-test where a 20 pound rod and line combo works for sailfish, dolphin and marlin. Use 130 pound rod and line combo for billfish and bluefin tuna.

, These rods work best for either hovering over a target or to retrieve your line at high speeds. Use specialized tackle to work your lure at the correct speed, either very quickly or slowly depending on the fish. Use vertical jigging with high-speed rods and metal lures for fast retrieval. In contrast, use rubber jigs to hover over the target or for slow, deliberate retrieval."

Create a budget.,
Choose a rod based on your experience.,
Learn proper technique.,
Select the length of the rod based on your location.,
Use a larger line and rod for larger fish.,
Ensure that the fly fishing line is designed for your rod.,
Choose the right bait.",How to Use a Fishing Rod5," Fly fishing rods are as good as you pay for so it’s important to know how often you will be using your rod and what skill level you are at before purchasing a fly fishing rod. While high-performance rods can help you, it may be helpful to wait until your casting skills have improved in order to reap the full benefits of an expensive rod.

, Beginners can choose inexpensive rods made of graphite, fiberglass, or bamboo. Price will reflect better materials and high-performance rods are better suited for experienced fisherman or people who plan to fly fish often.High quality rods can make casting easier which is imperative when fly fishing.
Fly rods may come in 2, 3, or 4 pieces. Most beginners use a 2 piece while more seasoned fisherman use a 4 piece as it can be broken down and easily carried on airplanes.

, Cast the line to mimic the movement of live prey. The presentation of your lure will depend on the type of fish with the rod and line working seamlessly to create specific movements.Movements can range from mimicking insects to frogs.

, Use 6 - 8 foot fly rods for fishing in smaller streams with a lot of brush. Move up to 9 foot rods when fishing in big rivers. The longer the rod, the more control you have over your line., The larger the fly, the heavier it is and the heavier the line you will need in order to deliver it. A larger rod ensures a smooth cast with heavier lures.Beginners should use 1 - 8 weight for trout, 6-10 weight for bass, and 5 weight for panfish.

, Fly rods are designed to only cast a certain weight of line. For example, only use a 6-weight line with a 6-weight rod. Check the rod information that’s printed above the cork grip to choose the corresponding weighted line.Different manufacturers will place the weight information on different locations on the rod and may have unique codes. Make sure to consult the manufacturer if you cannot find the pertinent information.

, The bait you choose will depend on the location and type of fish. Find the closest fly shop to the location that you will be fishing at and ask the sales staff what they would recommend.

Read the Manual!,
Mount your fish finder.,
Turn on your fish finder.,
Now start adjusting one feature at a time and become familiar with that feature.,
The next setting to visit in manual mode, is the Fish ID setting.,
Another feature, Auto Depth, is best used at its pre-programmed setting as you begin using your fish finder.,
As you are becoming more and more familiar with your fish finder, you will notice a horizontal line across the screen.,
One last feature to touch on in this article is the suppressor setting.",How to Use a Fish Finder," The manual may not be exciting or may have more technical information than you are interested in reading, but it cannot be stressed enough how important it is to read the manual in order to familiarize yourself with the unit you purchased.;
, Whether you are using a transom mount, trolling motor mount, hull mount or a portable mount, your manual will be able to walk you through the steps to properly mount your model. If in doubt, consult a professional or have a professional mount it for you.

, When you first turn the unit on, it will be in automatic mode, meaning that the pre-programmed settings will be in use. As you become more familiar with your model, you will be able to switch to manual mode and customize the settings to the fishing conditions you experience. To begin, leave the fish finder on automatic and take a five minute spin around the lake, bay or ocean that you fish in. Watch the display constantly to get a feel for what you see. Don’t worry about catching fish or understanding everything on the display yet. That will come with experience.

, One of the key settings to play around with is the Sensitivity setting. When you adjust the unit’s sensitivity you are adjusting the power of the fish finder. The simple rule of thumb is, the lower the power (sensitivity) the lower the quality of the view on the display. Start by setting the sensitivity to between 75 and 100%. Trial and error will be the best way to determine the optimal setting for your model.

, Once you have a feel for your unit, turn off the Fish ID feature and try to get used to reading the fish arches that you will see naturally on the screen. The fish icons displayed by the Fish ID are useful for true beginners, but once you begin to familiarize yourself with the display it is better to learn how to read the natural fish arches. The fish arches will give you a more accurate view of what is under water.

, Using the pre-programmed setting will tell the unit to automatically track the bottom and is best used when you are new to using sonar. As you become more of an expert, you can manually set the upper and lower limits of the display window. The smaller the display window you set the better the resolution will be. In general, expert anglers eliminate the top few feet of water and stop the scan about ten feet below the true bottom. The display window size will of course vary depending on how deep the water is and what type of fish you are looking to catch. Experiment with the display window size until you are comfortable with both the amount of water you can view and the picture resolution.

, This line is the Depth Cursor and can be moved up or down on the display. When you find some fish, adjust the depth cursor to cut through the fish arches and the unit will tell you exactly how deep those fish are. Now you know exactly how deep to drop your bait.

, This setting tells the unit how much “back ground” noise to filter out. Eliminating the back ground noise may be helpful, but if your transducer is mounted properly it is generally unnecessary. If you find you have to use the suppressor to locate fish, then you should check that your transducer is mounted correctly. In general you want to have the suppressor off as having the suppressor setting too high can block the sonar signal entirely and you won’t find fish that way!

Know how fishes' eyes are structured.,
Understand how water depth affects light penetration.",How to Use Color When Fly Fishing1," Human retinas contain two kinds of receptor cells, rods, and cones. Rods enable us to distinguish light from darkness and to see at lower levels of light, while cones function in brighter light and enable us to see colors. Fish eyes also contain both rods and cones, allowing them to see in color, with the proportion of rods to cones dependent on whether the fish inhabits relatively shallow or deep water.;
, Light is divided into various wavelengths. Longer wavelengths of light, such as red and orange, are absorbed quickly in water and therefore penetrate to a shallow depth. At a depth of 10 feet (3 m), red lights is almost completely absorbed, and at 30 feet (9.1 m), orange and yellow light is mostly absorbed. Shorter wavelengths of light, such as green and blue penetrate to a much greater depth, and scatter more, explaining why bodies of water appear blue or greenish from above.


How colors appear underwater is affected by how far away the object appears. Red objects turn gray and then black, while blue objects turn white before turning gray and finally black.

Choose fly color according to how bright the sky is.,
Choose fly colors according to how clear the water is.,
Choose fly color according to the season.,
Choose colors that match those of foods fish feed on.",How to Use Color When Fly Fishing2," The maxim for freshwater fishing lures is ""light day, light color; dark day, dark color."" This is more commonly applied to jigs, plastic worms, and crankbaits than to artificial flies, but it can be a factor with them, as well.

, Subtle color shades, such as maroon, indigo, and purple can be effective when fly-fishing in clear water. Fluorescent orange, yellow, and chartreuse flies can be effective when fished in muddy water or other conditions when fish having a harder time seeing the fly, as can black and red.


Fluorescent colors are more effective in muddy water and on cloudy days because they are made brightly visible by very short ultraviolet wavelengths of light. They are visible for greater distances than non-fluorescent colors, but are not as effective when fish show a preference for the natural color of specific bait.
Black and red can provide better contrast in both dirty water and low light conditions than can lighter non-fluorescent colors. Black, in fact, provides the best silhouette against a dark sky.

, Fly colors in nature vary according to the time of year. In the early spring, late fall, and winter, flies are usually darker in color, while from mid-spring to mid-autumn, they tend to be lighter in color. The color variations match those of their environment.

, Although they are called flies, dry and wet flies may also imitate minnows and crustaceans that fish feed on.


Pink is a good color to use when fly fishing for smallmouth bass, because it is found on creek chubs, minnows, and trout, and earthworms. This color also works on trout because larger trout will eat smaller trout, including their own young. For salmon, orange, yellow, and green often work better in the spring because they match colors found in the foods those fish feed on then.
Green chartreuse works for both fresh and saltwater fishing because of baitfish such as emerald shiners and ladyfish, while yellow chartreuse is effective because jackfish, shad, and herring all feature the color yellow.
One small freshwater crustacean, the scud, appears brown, olive, or tan; flies in these colors work well to imitate the scud when fished in slow, slight movements. When the scud dies, it may change to a brighter color such as pink, orange, or yellow; flies in these colors may work better when fished to simulate a dying scud.
Multi-colored flies should have the darker color on top of the lighter color, because this is the way the baitfish or insect the fly is imitating is usually colored.

Know the law.,
Catch and release.,
Handle the fish as little as possible.,
Pacify the fish to make the hook easier to remove.,
Slip the fish into the water; do not throw it.",How to Unhook a Fish," Keep the fish in the water as long as possible—do not bring it onto land, where it can flop about wildly, until you are close enough to grab it. Land the fish quickly. Don’t let it fight and jump until it’s exhausted. Increase the drag on your reel, and make sure that your fishing line is in good condition., Use one hand to grasp the fish around its pectoral fins (the fins below the gills). Place your index finger under the fish's chin to keep it from flopping around. This is a solid position, and it will be much more difficult for your catch to escape before you have removed the hook.


Avoid dangling your catch by the jaw—it will flop around in the air trying to return to the water, and it will be difficult to grab it again.
Consider placing the fish into a fine-meshed net that retains a bit of water. The fish will be less likely to flop around if it can lay in a bit of water. It can be much easier to remove the hook if the fish is relatively calm and you don't need to hold it in the air. You can find fine-meshed nets in fishing supply stores.

, A fish that's been reeled in slowly and pushed to exhaustion is much less likely to survive after it's released. If you catch and release a fish without subjecting it to undue stress, it can recover within 24 hours, to the extent that it will show no measurable effects from the experience., If you plan to release the fish, it's important to use a humane hook that is less likely to fatally injure your catch. A J-shaped hook is much more liable to snag in a fish's guts and gill, making it difficult to humanely remove. The pointed end of the circle hook is turned perpendicular to the shank to form a loop-like shape. In general, long-shanked hooks (with a longer bit to grab above the actual hook) are much easier to remove than short-shanked hooks, although the latter may present bait better.One study showed that striped bass hooked with a circle hook were 11 times as likely to survive than those that were caught with ""J"" hooks.Also avoid using treble hooks—the type with three points. These hooks are much more likely to strike a blood vessel and fatally harm the fish.Consider buying soft-wire hooks that naturally unbend as you pull them from a fish. These hooks are less sturdy than traditional hooks, and thus perhaps less efficient when it comes to actually catching fish. They may be worth the lower catch count, however, if you value a humane and low-effort catch-and-release method., If the hook is caught along the edge of your catch's mouth, you can slide it out. Try not to tear the fish's lip when you pull the hook out. Take your time, and pull the hook out the same way it went in.

, The way that you handle this situation depends on what you intend to do with the fish. If you plan to release the fish or keep it alive for another reason, you will need to be very careful not to harm the fish any further. If you plan to kill the fish anyway, you do not need to be as careful when you remove it.


If you are going to eat the fish, remove the hook when you gut it. It's very important to remove the hook before cooking and eating the fish. You don't want to bite down on the hook yourself. If you cook the hook, the layer of lead that coats the hook will melt into the fish, and anyone that eats the fish will run the risk of lead poisoning.
If you are throwing the fish back or otherwise keeping it alive, try to cut away a small piece of flesh and remove the hook. If you cannot remove the hook without killing your catch, cut the line as close as possible to the fish's mouth. Slide your bait over the shaft of the hook so that the fish will be able to feed regularly. Then, let the fish go. The fish will have a better chance of survival if you leave the hook in than if you rip it out., This tool may give you a more precise grip on the hook, and it removes any danger of the fish biting your finger. Slowly rotate the hook out the way it came. If the fish doesn't have sharp teeth, and hook is shallow enough, you can take the hook out with your fingers.


Try using the pliers to bend the hook away from the entry point. If you straighten the hook, it may be easier to pull it out without harming the fish.
You can also use pliers to dull the barb on your hook. This makes it easier for you to get the hook out, and catch-and-release fishing is much more humane if you don't mangle the fish.

, A disgorger is used in coarse fishing to remove a fishhook from deep inside the mouth of a fish—a hook that you cannot reach using fingers alone. The tool is typically made of plastic or metal, and it's typically used on smaller fish. To use the disgorger, slip the end over a tight line and slide it down to the bend of the hook. Push down on the tool to remove the hook. Under the pressure of the line, the hook will tighten against the end of the disgorger, allowing you to remove it from the mouth.

, If you are strictly fishing for fun, you can practice catch-and-release and throw the fish back into the water. You can choose to keep the fish for cooking, trophy stuffing, or keeping in an aquarium. Ultimately, you are making one choice: keep the fish, or release the fish.

, In the U.S., you must immediately return a fish to the water if it is too small, if it is caught out of season, or if catching it puts you over the daily catch limit.Before you go fishing, research the size and quantity limits for your area. If the Department of Fish and Game has placed restrictions upon fishing in a certain area, it has done so for a reason. If you don't abide by these limits, you run the risk of depleting local fish populations, destabilizing an ecosystem, and ruining the area for future fishermen.

, If you have an aversion to killing the fish (or simply don't want to go through the hassle of gutting it), you can remove the hook and release your catch back into the water from whence it came. This is the most humane choice. Be extra-careful when removing the hook—if you tear the fish's mouth or gills, it may bleed out in the water, and it may be vulnerable to attack from other fish.


If you throw the fish back, release it where you caught it, and give it a chance to swim away before you cast again. Make sure to put the fish into a safe spot where it can quickly reorient itself.
Never try to pull on the line to free the hook. This can severely damage the fish. Jerking the line may tug the hook through the flesh of the fish, creating deeper lacerations and making the animal more likely to bleed out in the water., If you must touch the fish, make sure that your hands are wet.The fish's scales and protective slime may stick to dry hands, making your catch much less equipped to survive in the water.

, Hold the fish belly up in the water to disorient the fish for a few seconds. This should briefly pacify the fish, giving you enough time to remove the hook and return it to its habitat., If you throw the fish at the surface of the water, it may be stunned or killed by the impact. Hold the fish firmly, in two hands, and bring it as close as possible to the water's edge before letting it wriggle free. If the fish doesn’t swim away, gently move it back and forth in the water. This helps it get a fresh dose of oxygen by moving water over its gills.

Keeping the lead line in between your pinky and ring finger, grab the half of the net that was resting over your thumb.,
Twist your body at the waist, keeping your toes pointing to the front, and unload to throw the cast net.,
Watch the net as it fans out clockwise and lays upon the water.",How to Throw a Cast Net," Most cast nets should come with a hand loop that's adjustable. You'll want this to be cinched down fairly tight and secured. The last thing you want to do is launch your expensive cast right into the lake. You might be successful at getting it back, but that's a lot of unproductive time on the water.






;
, The only thing attached to the net at this point, should be the loop of the hand line that is attached to your left wrist.








, Your coils will depend on the size of cast net that you are using; smaller lines require fewer coils. Generally, the smaller the cast net, the easier it is to handle and throw.








, The horn of the net is the top of the net, where the top cylinder of string is bunched up neatly, forming a neat end piece.








, First, bunch the net up. Then, coil one circle that's a little larger than the coils you made with the hand line. The coiled net








, Untwisting it as you pass it into your right hand, grab a hold of the net halfway between the leaded weights (skirt bottom) and the end of the coil (upper net).









If you've done this step correctly, one-half of the leaded weights should now be resting at the end of the net you have in your right hand.

, Be sure to keep a hold of the coils while you do this, and to roll your wrist down when transferring, so that the two piles of net don't really intersect.









If you've done this step correctly, the skirt bottom, where the leaded weights are attached, should have two distinct piles, one at a different height from one another.

Specifically, the pile that you just rolled over your left thumb should be higher than the other pile.



, It's not the most pleasant step, but it's not unpleasant either. If you don't want to do this step, you have an alternative, however:









Throw it over your left shoulder. You're going to need to use a little more of the skirt bottom in order to do this; it shouldn't make a difference. It should be comfortably resting behind your left shoulder and not slip off.

, Grab it with your right palm positioned upward, in between your pinky and ring finger.








, You'll be grabbing the top pile that you rested on your left thumb during Step 7.








, Unleash like a coil, spinning back to the right and when your whole mass is facing the same direction as your toes, let go of everything (especially with your teeth).









Let the net unfurl by using centrifugal force. Don't try to use a lot of power to cast your net. Like a golf swing, the easier and more natural your motion, the better the final outcome.
Remember to keep your arm outstretched as you uncoil the net. You don't want to extend your arm like you're throwing a frisbee; you want your arm to already be extended, and then simply release the cast net at the proper position.

, Let it sink to the bottom and then pull it in by the hand line and reap the rewards of a whole mess of baitfish.

Start from the middle of your 8 or 9 inch (20.3 or 22.9 cm) overlap, take one leader and wrap it around the other 4 to 5 times (6 for small diameter fluorocarbon) making sure that you have enough leader left to run it back through the center of the overlap.

,
Similarly wrap the other the leader 3 to 5 times at the opposite end of the overlap.

,
Know that when both lines have been wrapped around each other on each side of the overlap, feed the ends of both lines back through the center hole from opposite directions.

,
Grab a hold of the tips of each line you just ran through the center hole and pull them until each end of the knot ""folds"" and the tips won't pull out.,
Trim the excess line remaining from the knot and get ready to go fishing!

",How to Tie a Blood Knot for Fly Fishing,";
,,,,, Then slowly begin to pull the main stretches of line away from each other. Thoroughly wet the knot with saliva. During this process it's important to tighten it slowly so the wraps tighten uniformly, don't overlap each other, and the knot does not get hot during the tightening, which will weaken it.

Get the right type of trolling gear.,
Make sure your boat can travel slowly.,
Get a reliable color sonar unit and GPS system for identifying structure and areas holding striped bass.,
Choose your technique.,
When trolling, be sure to set your drag tight enough to secure a firm hook set, yet loose enough to prevent breaking off a big fish.",How to Troll for Striped Bass," Conventional reels spooled with lead core line, wire and braid work well. Keep in mind that wire can be difficult to use for novices, and that weight will have to be added in order to get most braid offerings down into the strike zone.;
, Depending on the trolling method, speeds as slow as 2 mph (3.2 km/h) may be necessary. If your boat does not idle that low, consider dragging buckets or a drift sock to slow your speed down.

, There's a lot of empty water out there-having good electronics will help you locate the hot spots.

, One of the most popular trolling methods is the tube and worm. Other techniques that consistently catch big bass on the troll include bunker spoons, jigs, live eels, rigged dead eels, swimming plugs, umbrella rigs and live mackerel and porgies to name just a few.

, Typically a drag pressure of 9-10 pounds is sufficient for the initial strike.

Crappie aren't called ""paper mouths"" for nothing.,
If you aren't catching fish, you are probably fishing too deep.,
In-line planer boards like Offshore Tackle's OR-34 Mini Board can be a great way to target open water Crappie.",How to Troll for Crappie," You can do this by looking at your depth finder as you zig-zag slowly along. Crappie hang out in schools and will appear as Christmas Tree shapes or lots of streaks.;
, They are cheap and easy to rig up, and the tails make good swimming movements in the water. Start by tying two 1/16-ounce jigs to your line, about eighteen inches apart.

, Good colors to start with include chartreuse, green, black/green/blue, and yellow.

,,,, If the tip starts to twitch hard or the rod bends, pick up the rod and start reeling.

, Don't horse the fish and use a net if it's a big one.

, Crappie feed up, so it's better to be too shallow than too deep.

, They attach directly to the line and can be used with any style rod. The are basically ""directional bobbers"" which can be used with any rod type. They are especially good when you need to cover a lot of water and when fish are spooky and shy away from the boat.

Learn the live bait fishing regulations in your area.,
Select a variety of live bait, or choose from what's available.,
Keep your bait alive.,
Wait to rig your bait until you are about to cast.,
Remove your bait from the habitat securely.,
Hook bait-fish through the body behind the dorsal fin.,
Hook crayfish, salamanders, and frogs through the tail or through the head.,
Hook worms, caterpillars, and grubs by bunching them up.,
Hold the bait firmly while preparing to cast.,
Use a split-shot rig with a sinker.,
Keep a light touch on your line.",How to Rig Live Bait," In some areas, especially in the Northwest, fishing with live bait is restricted to particular varieties of bait and particular waters. Bait fish, for instance, are often illegal in rivers in Washington and Oregon. Double-check to make sure it's legal to fish with the kind of bait you intend to use by checking with the state department of Fishing and Wildlife in your area.;
, The right kind of live bait depends completely on where you fish, what you're fishing for, and what's available. If you've got an infestation of grasshoppers, don't waste time trying to catch up a bunch of minnows to go fishing. Get rid of your pests and find some bait at the same time.Common live baits include:


fathead minnows
goldfish
loach
nightcrawlers
rat-tailed maggots
corn borers
grasshoppers
crayfish
small salamanders or frogs

, Find a small habitat for your live bait to keep them alive until you're ready to set out fishing. Make sure there's enough moisture and air circulation, and any leaves or bits of grass for them to feed on until you're ready to fish. Try not to keep them in there for more than a day or two, or they may die. Worms will be fine in some fine moist earth for a longer period.








, The whole point of using live bait is to keep it alive as long as possible into the fishing process, so the wriggling attracts fish. If you rig your hook too early, your bait will be dead by the time you get it in the water. Keep it close by and get your hook on the line, get set up, and get ready to fish.

, This is easier said than done with bait fish. If you're fishing with minnows, getting a hold of one is more than half the battle. Pull bait-fish from the bait tank by grasping it firmly and preventing it from squirming. Get a good grip on it with one hand and bring your hook in with the other.








, You can often insert your fish hook in one smooth motion either just behind the dorsal fin, then cast immediately and gently, letting the bait fall into the water as easily as possible to keep it alive.Alternatively, hook bait-fish through the lips and jaw so they'll live longer. The position behind the dorsal fin is often most secure, but causes the bait to tire out quickly and die fast. Inserting the fish hook through the lips makes it more likely that the fish will not drown quickly, but will cause it to move more awkwardly through the water. Inserting the hook through the nostrils will keep the bait alive as long as possible, but is riskier, as the fish may escape.

, Like bait-fish, crayfish give you a number of options for hooking them. Make sure you go deep enough into the tail and close enough to the torso to get a good grip on the crayfish, to avoid losing the bait to wriggling. If you go through the head, you'll get a secure grip but the bait won't last as long.


For salamanders and frogs, go through the torso near one of the back legs. They'll still put up a good amount of wriggling, but it'll be difficult for them to wriggle off the hook.

, Start close to one end of the worm, folding it back over on itself multiple times--at least 3--to secure the worm or other wriggler snugly on the hook.








, Make sure you don't lose your bait before you get it in the water. Hold onto it gently as you prepare to cast, and cast gently into the water where you want it to go. Do it quickly, but gently.

, To keep the live bait at an appropriate depth and control the line for the kind of fish you want to catch, it's usually common to rig your line up with a split-shot sinker to weight things down.


Alternatively, grasshoppers and other lighter insects might be more appropriate to let float on the surface, depending on what it is you're fishing for. If you want it to float, leave the sinker off.

, Remember not to tug too strongly on the fish hook. Proper rigging requires you to keep the bait as healthy as possible before casting it in the water. Happy hunting!


Remove dead bait if you are not successful and rig again. Try to troubleshoot any problems you may have had with the last bait and adjust hook position accordingly.

Start with shallow water spearfishing.,
Go free dive spearfishing.,
Follow safety guidelines.,
Target your prey.,
Spear your prey.,
Hook the fish.",How to Spear a Fish1," To get comfortable with spearfishing, start out in shallow water and fish above the water line. This does not require total body submersion.There are different ways to perform shallow water spearfishing. It can be as easy as standing onshore and spearing fish with a sharpened stick. You can also stand in the water, stand on rocks, or use a kayak as a spearfishing platform.
In shallow water you can use a technique known as ""stalking"" where you hunt fish that are just below the surface, on the surface, or near rocks and ridges. Different types of fish have different behaviors that you will learn to recognize over time.
While in shallow water, you can spearfish just below the surface using a snorkel to enter the water for a short period of time.
Above the water line spearfishing may be the safest method because it avoids the dangers of underwater diving.;
, Free dive spearfishing is an underwater method of spearfishing that requires a breathing apparatus. To achieve great diving technique, breathe deeply, arch your back as you would diving into a swimming pool, and enter the water head first with your fins in the air allowing your weight to push you towards the bottom. Quietly glide through the water to observe the ocean life and locate your desired fish.


Use a dive mask for longer dives and a snorkel for shorter dives.
If you are wearing a wetsuit, you will need a weight belt.
Be sure not to kick your legs for momentum until you are completely submerged into the water, and then only make slight movements so that you do not frighten your prey.
Once you reach your desired location in the water, creep slowly towards the fish using your free hand to navigate yourself. Gently kick your legs and hide or camouflage yourself from your prey wherever possible.

, Spearfishing presents more challenges than the standard rod and line fishing because you are in the water as a predator hunting prey. Some of the dangers include sharks, anglers (individuals fishing with a rod and line), and those spearfishing who may mistake you for prey or accidentally hit you with a spear.Always have a partner when spearfishing so that you can look out for each other, especially if you are deep dive spearfishing.

, When using a pole spear, extend your arm halfway out so that there is room to lengthen your reach at the final moment of attack. Once you've established that the fish is within range of the fully released spear, extend your arm and release the spear in one smooth movement, aiming for the head of the fish.


If using a speargun while shallow water or deep dive spearfishing, you do not have to extend your arm to release a spear, simply release the safety and point the speargun at your target.

, Aim for the base of the skull where the spine connects because it immediately kills the fish and prevents suffering. After hitting your target, grab either the fish or the protruding point of the spear to control the flapping fish.Be sure that you are close enough to the fish and have a good aim so that you have a greater likelihood of killing the fish as opposed to just harming it.
Consider carrying a knife during your dive to ensure a humane process. You may need to use your knife to kill the fish so that it does not suffer.
Be sure that your spear is prepared and ready to go prior to entering the water. You will not be able to prepare the spear while in the water because your hands should be free whenever possible.
Whether spearfishing for sport or hunting for food to eat, be sure to know what type of fish that you wish to harvest. The focus on trophy hunting is size, but when hunting for edible fish, parrotfish, lionfish, triggerfish, and small Snapper are all good targets because they are generally safe and many people enjoy the taste. Always avoid large and dangerous ocean life, including the poisonous weever fish., After spearing your prey, hook it to your fish carrier or place it in a designated location if you plan to continue spearfishing.


Wearing gloves will prevent you from harming your hands when you are handling fish with sharp spines.
Be aware that the blood from the fish speared may attract other ocean life.

Choose a pole spear.,
Choose a speargun.,
Bring an extra spear.",How to Spear a Fish2," Often, those that are new to spearfishing start with pole spears because they are lightweight, cost effective, and easy to use. It is believed that longer pole spears are more effective. Pole spears made of aluminum work well on larger fish., Spearguns are generally used by more advanced fishers and which speargun you decide to use depends on the type of fish that you want to hunt. Each type of speargun, regardless of the manufacturer, feels different in different environments, so it can be very difficult to choose.While you can decide between pneumatic guns, wood guns, and euro guns, you may not know which type of of gun is best until you have had practice with various types of guns. Beginners should start with a small speargun. It is best to start with the less expensive model.

, Consider placing an extra pole spear or speargun in your kayak or boat so that you do not get all of the way to your destination and have to turn around because of a problem with the equipment.

"
"
Choose clean and clear water locations.,
Spearfish in remote locations.,
Set diving boundaries.",How to Spear a Fish3," Look for clear water where there are plenty of meandering fish. Poor water quality can result in illness. Popular spearfishing destinations are Wisconsin, Panama, Puerto Rico, and Nicaragua.Get an understanding of the type of fish that you want to find so that you know what you are looking for.

, You can locate a remote beach and rent a kayak to find healthy, great tasting fish.If you are deep dive spearfishing, try to find a location where there are no other people spearfishing to reduce the risk of your dive.

, Prior to your dive, establish with your dive partner the radius for the dive and the overall timeframe so that you are aware of each other’s location at all times. This will also serve as a precaution should one of you get lost or experience problems, particularly during a deep dive.

Choose the right rod for the technique and you.,
Choose a good quality reel.,
Choose the right weight of line.,
Choose a plastic bubble to thread onto the line.,
Choose the right leader length.,
Choose a selection of flies to cover most of your fishing needs.,
Nymphs: Beadhead Prince, Beadhead Flashback Pheasant Tail, Beadhead Hare's Ear, Beadhead Zug Bug, and Copper John (in red and copper).",How to Set Up a Fishing Pole for Fly and Bubble Fishing1," Most anglers use the fly and bubble technique with an ultralight spinning rod, as spinning tackle is best suited to the light lines used for fly and bubble fishing. Some anglers favor rods as short as 5 feet (1.5 m) when fishing streams whose banks are overgrown with weeds and brush and as long as 8 feet (2.4 m) (2.4 m) in wider rivers and in lakes, while other anglers favor lengths from 6 to 7 feet (1.8 to 2.1 m). The rod should have a fast action tip.


Longer rods allow for more distance when casting and can better simulate the action of a fly rod; however, shorter rods can be packed and carried more easily when fishing in remote areas.;
, As noted above, a spinning reel is the preferred reel for fly and bubble fishing. The reel should have a smooth-functioning bail and retrieving action and a good quality drag to handle the light lines the fly and bubble technique calls for.

, Fly and bubble fishing calls for light lines of from 4 to 6 pound test (2 to 3 kg class). Many anglers like to go even lighter with the leader the fly is attached to, choosing 2 to 4-pound test (1 to 2 kg class) line.

, The most common shape for plastic bubbles used in fly and bubble fishing is a teardrop-shape, with the thicker end facing the rod and the narrower end facing the lure. Some anglers prefer a more tapered bubble that is at its thickest in the center and equally narrow on either end, while others prefer spherical bubbles. Bubbles can be held in place with built-in clips, although some anglers favor bubbles that use rubber or plastic tubing to keep them in place.


Most bubbles feature a stopper you can push in to fill the bubble with as much water as necessary to provide casting weight without hampering the flies action. Generally, for fishing dry flies, which are designed to fish on the surface, you should fill the bubble about half-full so that it will still float on the water after being cast, while for wet flies, which are designed to be fished underwater, you should fill the bubble completely. (Some anglers even add a couple of small split shot to the line to increase the flies running depth.)

, Some anglers favor a length of 6 feet (1.8 m) for wet flies and 9 feet (2.7 m) (2.7 m) for dry flies, while others prefer a length of 5 to 7 feet (1.5 to 2.1 m) (1.5 to 2.1 m) regardless of the type of fly being fished. You may want to experiment with varying lengths according to weather and water conditions and your own preferences. After threading the plastic bubble onto your line, you attach the leader to a small swivel, which you tie onto your line to keep the bubble from sliding down to the fly.


Some anglers prefer using the same kind of tapered leader that fly fishermen use, while others prefer to use ordinary monofilament.

, Fly and bubble fishing works with most kinds of flies, but you only need a modest selection. While fishing for trout often requires you to ""match the hatch"" with the kind of fly the trout are feeding on, panfish and bass are much less finicky about the type of fly they'll hit. A suggested selection of flies is given below:


Dry flies: Adams Irresistible, Black Gnat, California Mosquito, El Capitan, Ginger Quill, Gray Wulff, Red Ant, Renegade, Royal Coachman. Some dry flies can be fished wet to simulate a drowning insect.
Wet flies: Adams Wet, Muddler Minnow, Wooly Bugger (in black, brown, olive, or black and olive combination), Wooly Worm (in brown or olive).

, (Beadhead streamers have lightly weighted heads to help them sink.) When fishing for trout, you may want to include nymphs that match the kinds of flies the trout are feeding on.

"
"
Cast sidearm.,
Count down the fly if fishing it underwater.,
Retrieve slowly.,
Watch the bubble.,
Set the hook with a short, sharp motion.",How to Set Up a Fishing Pole for Fly and Bubble Fishing2," In addition to preventing your leader from casting on overhead branches or otherwise snapping, casting sidearm will permit the bubble to lead the fly during the cast (much like weighted lines lead the leader in fly casting) and let the fly land naturally.

, Submerged flies should be let fall to a depth of 5 to 10 feet (1.5 to 3 m) before you begin your retrieve.


You can test the rate of fall by dropping the fly and bubble in the water and note how long it takes to fall to a particular depth. When you cast the fly, you can count down to this same depth before starting your retrieve.

, Flies fished on or near the surface should be presented as though they're drifting with the current toward shore, with occasional twitches to mimic struggling. Submerged flies should be fished with a stop-and-go action or with slow pulls to simulate a swimming minnow or crustacean. Your bubble should cause a slight wake in calm water to provide sufficient resistance to the line to help you distinguish between when a fish hits the fly and when the fly hits something else.

, As with the more familiar, colored, clip-on bobbers, if the bubble suddenly dips or bobs sharply, a fish has taken the fly.

, This will help drive the hook home. If you fail to set the hook, return to the same slow retrieve you were using. The fish may think it only injured the fly and want to move in for the kill.

"
"
Tie on a caddis imitation.,
Position yourself slightly upstream and to the right or left of where you believe the trout are holding in the river or stream.,
Make a cast across the creek or stream and allow the fly to float downstream on the opposite side of the stream from where you are standing.,As the fly reaches the end of its drift and your line straightens out, you will want to raise the rod tip to upward toward the sky - but still pointing in the general direction of the fish, or where you think the fish may be holding.,
As soon as the fly starts to move across the surface of the creek, you should gently shake the rod tip and try to put uniform ""waves"" into your fly-line.,
As the fly dances across the creek, you should be ready for a trout to launch itself toward the fly.,
If you do not connect with a trout, repeat the steps a few times from the same location.,
If a trout does connect with the fly, there is usually no need to forcefully set the hook - the trout normally hook themselves.",How to Skate an Artificial Caddis Fly," This may be an ""Elk Hair Caddis"" which more precisely imitates the caddisfly natural, or a ""Stimulator"" type fly which is a general attractor pattern that is high-floating and easy to skitter across the water.
, You'll want to be no more than a short cast's length from the spot you think will produce a fish, because the more line you have out the harder the fly is to control when skittering., You want the fly to reach the end of the cast at a point where the fish are between you and the fly at a downstream angle across the creek.,, This will translate into the fly skipping and skittering across the surface if done properly. You may have to adjust your movements of the rod tip to match the speed of the current in the water, or the wind or several other factors. Practice will help you master the proper amount of pressure and movement needed in any given situation., You are not trying to skitter the fly all the way back to your position - but only to skitter it across the creek over waiting fish. Often, the ""takes"" are violent and occasionally the fish will come completely out of the water chasing the skittered caddis imitation. Skittering imitates a female caddis laying her eggs on the stream. The caddis dips down and does ""touch and go"" landings, each time depositing eggs into the water. The fish see these caddis as an easy meal about to escape, and will often chase the skittered fly because of instinct, when they are not actively feeding otherwise., If no trout chase or hit the fly after a few attempts, move downstream by taking two or three steps and repeating the process over a slightly new section of water., So, most of the time you only need to be concerned with being ready for the trout to hit the fly. Then, hold on and play the fish normally until it tires and is ready to be landed."
"
Choose a durable tip-up.,
Choose a tip-up you can see from a distance.,
Look for helpful features.",How to Set Up an Ice Fishing Tip Up1," While some tip-ups offer fancy looks and features, you want to look at the materials the tip-up is made of. Although plastics are lighter in weight, they usually do not handle exposure to sunlight and cold weather as well as either wood or metal.


Most tip-ups are designed so that the line spool is underwater when the tip-up is set up. The water protects the spool and line from freezing in the cold air. Some tip-ups, however, use a windlass design that keeps the line spool and most of the tip-up above the water.





;
, Your tip-up should have a large enough flag on a long enough pole that you can see it from a distance of 100 yards (91.4 m) (90 m) in most weather conditions. Choose an orange flag over a yellow one, as a yellow flag will appear white as you get further away from it.


Having the rest of the rig be brightly colored as well can be helpful as well to keep you from accidentally stepping on it as you check all your rigs. If your tip-up isn't brightly colored but is made of wood or metal, you can paint it so you can see it better.







, In addition to their cross pieces, line spool, and flag, some tip-ups offer special features to assist ice fishermen in recognizing when a fish is on the line and helping to keep the hole being fished open.

Some tip-ups supplement the flag with an ""action indicator"" that shows the line movement when a fish has taken the bait and is swimming away with it.






Some tip-ups feature a round cover that fits over the hole being fished to keep it from being exposed to the air and thus freezing over.







"
"
Fill the line spool with a braided or Dacron line.,
Attach a swivel to the end of the line.,
Attach a hook to the other end of the leader.,
Bait your hook with the right live bait for the species you're after.,
Use enough split shot to keep your bait down, but no more.",How to Set Up an Ice Fishing Tip Up2," While monofilament line is appropriate for the reel on an ice fishing rod, a braided or Dacron line of 30 to 40 pound test (15 to 20 kg class) is a better choice for a tip-up, as you can see it more easily against the snow than a (usually) clear monofilament line. You will need a short length of monofilament �- from at least 6 inches (15 cm) to as much as 3 to 4 feet (0.91 to 1.2 m) (0.9 to 1.2 m) of 8 to 10 pound test (4 to 5 kg class) -- for a leader, but only for that purpose.


If ice fishing for pike, substitute a braided steel leader for the monofilament.

, Your monofilament leader is attached to the other end of the swivel.

, The size and type of hook depends on the type of fish you're after.


For bluegill, crappie, perch, or other panfish, use a size 6 or size 8 single hook.
For walleye, use a size 4 or size 6 single hook.
For pike, use a size 2/0 to 6/0 single hook or a treble hook. Some hook rigs for pike feature a pair of treble hooks.

, In most cases, you'll use minnows, shad, or suckers; however, grubs, mealworms, or waxworms can be effective for panfish. Pieces of nightcrawlers work well for bluegill, crappie, and perch, while whole nightcrawlers are good bait for catfish or largemouth bass.

, Attach your split shot to the leader, far enough from the bait to sink it, but not enough to impair its swimming ability; about 4 to 5 inches (10 to 12.5 cm) is about the right distance.


Using split shot with little projections at the end opposite the mouth of the split shot will let you change split shot weights as necessary without having to cut the leader to change the shot.

"
"
Choose a rod shorter than you use for open water fishing.,
Choose a sensitive rod.,
Choose the right rod action for your presentation.",How to Rig an Ice Fishing Rod1," While you can ice fish with a rod the same length as you normally use for open water fishing, most fishermen prefer to use a shorter rod; since baits are dropped through holes bored in the ice rather than cast, the extra length isn't necessary. A shorter rod is also an advantage in the tight quarters of most ice fishing shacks. A typical ice fishing rod is 3 to 4 feet (0.9 to 1.2 m) in length and thinner overall than a rod used for open water fishing.;
, Because fish move more slowly in cold water, they usually do not hit baits or artificial lures as aggressively as they do in warmer water. You'll want a rod made from graphite or boron fiber to better help you sense the light taps you're likely to feel when a fish takes your bait.

, The right rod action can help you present your bait or lure more effectively when ice fishing. A fast tip will impart more action to your lure when vertical jigging, which can be helpful on days when fish are more aggressive, typically toward the end of winter as fish forage more to prepare for spring spawning. A light or slow action will produce a subtler, more fluid action better suited to more lethargic fish. It can be helpful to use both kinds of rods and switch between them as necessary.

"
"
Choose a reel suited for ultralight fishing.,
Choose a light test or class line.",How to Rig an Ice Fishing Rod2," Because fish are cold-blooded, they are usually less active during the winter months than in summer and therefore do not put up as much of a fight as in warmer weather, so it usually isn't necessary to use heavy lines when ice fishing. A spinning or spincast reel with a good quality gear system and drag will work well when ice fishing.


You may need to use a thinner reel lubricant for ice fishing than for warm water fishing, as thicker lubricants tend to gel in colder weather. (This is the same reason you use a thinner or multi-viscosity oil in your car during the winter.)

, Lines of 2 to 6 pound test (1 to 3 kg class) are usually the best choice for ice fishing. Most ice fishermen spool their reels regular nylon monofilament line, although some favor lines specially designed for ice fishing.

"
"
Use tiny jigs for panfish.,
Use tiny spoons for larger game fish species.,
Try swimming lures for a different presentation.,
Consider sweetening your lure with some live bait.,
Add a spring bobber for a more fluid lure or bait action.",How to Rig an Ice Fishing Rod3," Bluegill, crappie, and other panfish eat tiny insects and plankton during the winter months. Jigs of 1/16 ounce (1.77 g) or less simulate these tiny food items.


Some ice fishing jigs more closely resemble the flies used in fly fishing and are called ice flies.

, Spoons wobble and flash their way through the water as they are retrieved, attracting bass, walleye, trout, and pike. Like jigs, they are typically fished in an up-and-down motion when ice fishing.


Some fishermen take the treble hook off the spoon and attach a short leader in its place, to which they attach a jig. This setup attracts perch and other panfish.

, Made of metal, swimming lures for ice fishing are thin and flat, with a fluke at one end to give them a swimming motion. The eye of the lure, however, is typically opposite a treble hook in the center of the lure body, with single hooks projecting from the front and rear.

, Although ice fishermen more commonly use live bait when fishing with tip-ups, some add tiny minnows to swimming lures or small pieces of fish underbelly meat to a spoon. The fish meat adds a natural smell and taste that the artificial lure alone can't provide and makes finicky fish more likely to take the bait.

, A spring bobber is a small bobber that attaches to the line by means of a spring wound around one of its projections. The bobber's buoyancy helps to smooth out the jerkiness of jigging small jigs, spoons, and swimming lures up and down and also helps detect when fish take the bait. This aspect can be useful when wearing gloves while fishing or in other situations where it's necessary to rely on sight instead of touch to detect when you have a bite.

Select the right kind of rod for bass fishing.,
Pick a reel based on your skill level.,
Choose the right fishing line for bass.,
Thread the line through the ceramic guides on the pole.,
Tie a hook or lure at the end of the line.",How to Set up a Fishing Pole for Bass Fishing," Think of your fishing pole as a tool. Like any tool, it's designed to perform a specific function. Many factors must be considered in choosing a fishing rod that will help you catch bass. Some of the basic features include:


Action: The rod's primary function is to take strain off the line when you're fighting a fish. The type of action, or flexibility, you need in your rod depends on the fish you're targeting. Most fishermen find that medium-action rods are ideal for bass. The action level is printed on the rod handle.
Type: The type of rod you choose has to be compatible with the reel you're using. A casting rod is compatible with either a spincast or baitcast reel. An open-faced spinning reel only works on a spinning rod.
Assembly: Most fishing rods are made from graphite or fiberglass and can be disassembled for easy storage. Two-piece rods connect at the ferrule, which is usually marked. Slide the pieces together and twist to secure the connection. After assembly, make sure the small circular guides that run along the length of the rod line up.;
, Some reels offer significant advantages over others but are difficult to operate. The 3 type most popular types among bass anglers are:


Spincast: This type of reel is easy to use, making it ideal for beginners. But it's best suited for pan fish, like bluegill and crappie. A Spincast reel can be easily attached to the top of a casting rod. Slide the reel mount into the reel seat at the top of the handle on the rod. Tighten the connection mechanism by hand.
Baitcast: Baitcast reels are ideal for bass fishing. They provide the angler with pinpoint casting accuracy and have the torque to pull heavy lures and large fish out of dense underwater vegetation. Like spincast types, they mount on the top of the rod.
Spinning: Spinning reels set on the underside or the pole. The low friction of the system enables fishermen to cast lightweight lures considerable distances.

, When you buy a new reel, the store will spool it with whatever kind of fishing line you choose. There are 3 primary types of line: nylon monofilament, fusion/braided and fluorocarbon. Comparisons between the types are based on several factors.


Test: The breaking point of the line is its test strength, which is measured in pounds. Fusion and braided lines may be listed with a 12-lb. diameter, but can withstand 24 lbs. of force.
Abrasion resistance: Spool your reel with a line that is rated for high abrasion resistance. This allows you to fish the heavy cover where bass lurk without damaging the line.
Knot strength: Fishermen tie knots in fishing lines and leaders to secure rigs, lures, hooks and jogs. Knots weaken lines. Sections that have been knotted several times should be cut after a period of time.

, Release the drag on your reel and slip the line through the circular ceramic guides that run the length of the rod. With a spinning set-up, make sure you run the line under the bail before threading the guides.

, Decide whether you want to use live bait or artificial lures to catch bass in your area. Through experience, you'll learn what baits are most effective at certain times of the day and with specific kinds of bass. Lures and hooks can be tied using any number of techniques, but the fisherman's knot is among the strongest.


Push the line through the eye of the lure.
Pull the line back over itself and wrap it around the section leading to the lure 5 times.
Holding the wrapped section in place, slip the end of the line through the loop under the eye.
Drop the end of the line through the large loop that remains.
Hold the main section of line and the end of the line. Pull the coils together until they spiral. Make sure they don't bunch up and overlap each other.
Clip the end with pliers. With the lure on the end of the line, you're ready to fish.

Attach the newly formed loop of mono to the muzzle clip.",How to Rig a Speargun," Use scissors to cut mono of the previous rig that is to be replaced. Discard the previous rig.;
, Acquire a 1.8 mm (.07 inch) diameter mono, which is available at most dive shops. Use scissors to cut off an initial length of 5 m (4.58 yards) to begin the rigging process.

,


Slide a 2.2 mm (0.09 inch) double barrel copper crimp over 1 end of the mono. These crimps are available at most dive shops.
Pass the end of the mono that the crimp slid over through the attachment hole in the back end of the spear. Pass the mono through from the right side of the spear to the left side. Determine left and right using the single barb on the front of the spear, which should be held facing up.
Pass the end of the mono back through the crimp. Leave only a short length of mono extending past the crimp. Use a cigarette lighter to melt a small blob on to the end of the mono. This will prevent the mono from pulling back out of the crimp while you are working.
Adjust the mono and the crimp by pulling the long end of the mono back through the crimp until the crimp sits against the flat surface on the back of the spear.
Use a double actuated crimping tool to secure the crimp. Leave about 1.5 mm (0.06 inch) on either end of the crimp uncrimped. This will avoid metal edges applying strain directly against the mono. Crimping tools are available at most dive shops.

, The spear should slide in with ease. Make sure that the mono is laying on the right of the spear, to the right side of the speargun muzzle.

, Loop the mono over the clip, which is just in front of the speargun trigger, and run it back up the barrel to the muzzle clip.

,


Slide the mono into 1 side of a double barrel crimp and back through the other side to form a loop of mono on 1 end of the crimp.
Judge the spacing of the attachment loop of the mono. The newly formed loop must attach to the muzzle clip creating enough tension to keep the mono engaged over the line release clip. Do not pull this mono line too taut as mono will shrink slightly in water.
Finish the mounting loop of the mono. Cut off excess mono using scissors. Use the cigarette lighter to melt a small ball on to the end of the mono. Use the crimping tool to secure the crimp.

, The speargun is now rigged and ready for spearfishing use.

Very carefully inspect the injury.,
Clean the area around the hook with an antiseptic if you have one available.,
Decide which direction will cause more damage removing the hook.,
Apply a topical antiseptic to the wound when the hook is removed, and bandage it.

,
Have a medical provider examine any wound caused by the hook even if you successfully extract it yourself, as infection may occur, including tetanus.",How to Remove a Fishing Hook from Your Finger," If it is just through the epidermis, you may be lucky enough to pull it back out the way it went in, but if it has a barb on it, and the barb is through the skin, you have to address that issue before removing it, as the barb will rip more tissue out with it as it comes.;
, This will decrease the likelihood of infection.

, Shallowly embedded hooks may be pulled out even if the barb is beneath the skin, but only if the hook is small, and has a thin barb, or it is just beneath the skin itself, and isn't deep enough to be in the muscles, tendons, or cartilage beneath the skin.


For subcutaneously embedded hooks, grasp the shank with a pair of pliers, and pull it the opposite direction it went in.
For shallow muscular puncture, you may be able to cut the shank of the hook with pliers or diagonal cutters (assuming you have them in your tackle box), and push the hook in a curving direction back through the skin adjacent to the original penetration. Leave as much shank as possible so you can grip it while you push the hook through, then grip the point and remove the hook where it emerges through the skin.
For very deep puncture, you will probably need to wrap the hook to keep it from moving, and seek medical attention, since you may cause serious tissue damage no matter which way you remove it yourself.

,, Be sure that your tetanus shot is effective.

Find a tide table.,
Locate the relevant date.,
Understand Chart Datum.,

Find low tide information.,
Read the time.,
Understand swell direction.,
Read height and interval.,
Learn tide patterns.,
Take advantage of high tide.,
Venture out mid-tide.,
Enjoy low tide.,
Factor in the weather.",How to Read Tide Tables," You should use one specific to the area you plan to visit, as beaches, harbors and fishing sites that are near each other can have dramatically different tides.


Local newspapers typically print tide tables near weather information.
Marinas are likely to have tide tables specific to the area.
Reference stations constantly collect data to provide detailed tide information. Their findings are available online and can be found through a simple search.;
, Tidal information may be printed for a week or more in advance. If you are planning an outing for tomorrow, use tomorrow’s date. If your plans are flexible, look instead for the data that is most important to you, such as finding a low tide at a convenient time. This may mean waiting several days for the best opportunity.


Remember that high and low tide times will be different every day, so do not make plans for the future based on a chart for the present.

, This term refers to a plane of reference against which tidal heights are measured. It is an average of low tide heights. This number is set low so that most low tides will not fall below it. It is also the reference point that nautical charts use to measure depth., High tide will be expressed as a positive number, sometimes with a plus (+) sign before it. This number indicates how high above Chart Datum the tide will be at its greatest swell.


A high tide indicated as an 8 tells you that at its highest, the water will be 8 feet above the average low water mark.
Remember that outside the United States the metric system prevails and measurements will be in meters, not feet.

, Low tide will be expressed as a small number, or possibly a negative number. This number indicates the relationship between the water depth at its lowest ebb and Chart Datum. Because Chart Datum is an average, not the absolute lowest the tide could ever be, sometimes low tide will fall below the average low water mark.When low tide is expressed as a negative (-), it means the tide will fall below Chart Datum. -1 means the low tide will be one foot below the average low water mark.
The low tide may also be a positive number. The number 1.5 indicates that the lowest tide will be 1.5 feet above Chart Datum.
Remember that outside the United States these units will be in metric.

, Depending on location, high and low tides may occur twice in a day or only once. The time may be listed using a 24 hour clock, also known as military time. Be certain that you have distinguished properly between morning and evening tide times.


To read a military clock, remember that the numbers continue onward from noon. So 1:00 could also be written as 13:00 because it is noon (12) plus one hour (13).
If the number is large and you don't want to count up, simply subtract twelve to get the number in the a.m./p.m. system. 23:00-12:00 will be 11 pm.

, This information, often indicated by a letter, tells you from what direction the waves will be coming. For instance, the letter W tells you that the waves will be coming from due west. This information is particularly important for surfers.


If the beach faces north, but the waves are coming from the northwest, the waves will break differently as they hit the beach or point break.

, Some tide tables include predictions about wave height, also referred to as the swell, and wave interval. Wave height is the distance between the crest of the the wave and the trough, or the lowest point in a wave. The interval indicates the average number of seconds that elapse between waves as they hit an offshore buoy.For surfing purposes, a longer interval makes for a larger wave.
Shorter intervals make for gentler waves, which are safer for swimming.
Large swells and long intervals make for massive surf.

, Understanding the local pattern can help you predict whether you will have two daily opportunities to navigate or beachcomb, or only one. In general, it takes around six hours for a tide to fully recede and hit the lowest point, then another six hours for it to come back in to the highest point.


In many coastal regions, tides rise and fall twice every day. These tides are called semidiurnal tides and are common on the east coast of the United States.
In some places one of the high tides is dramatically higher than the other, a pattern called mixed tides. This occurs in many places on the west coast of the United States.
In some places there is only one tidal cycle per lunar day, with one high and one low tide in a 24 hour period. This is common in many places along the Gulf of Mexico., When the water is at its highest, boats can safely pass over obstacles that might otherwise cause problems, such as reefs or sand bars. This is often the best time to go in or out of harbor.


Use a nautical chart to help you navigate safely.
If you are going out in a boat, whether it is a kayak or a large vessel, you need to know the channel depth, which a tide table cannot tell you.

, Surfers often find the best waves when the water is between high and low tide, though it varies by location. When the tide is low rocks may be exposed, or kelp may interfere with the board. When the tide is highest waves may not break until they are too close to shore to surf.If you are estuary fishing, larger fish will move toward deeper water as the outgoing tide exposes shallow areas. This is a good time to fish in estuaries., When the tide is out, beachcombers and tide pool enthusiasts have the best opportunity to see marine life exposed. Rocky shores such as those along the Washington and Oregon coast offer the best chance to see marine life in tide pools.


Lower tide may also be preferable for tall boats that need to pass under bridges. Knowing the clearance of the bridge and the height of your boat can help you choose the best time to navigate in and out of a harbor.
Low tide exposes mud where you can dig for clams. You can begin digging one or two hours before the expected low tide and continue your search one or two hours after the tide begins to come in again. Look for small holes in the sand that squirt juice when you stamp next to them., Tides are not the only consideration when fishing or playing near the ocean. Strong winds can change predicted tide depths by a foot or more. Storms can be dangerous for ships or beach goers. The season can also play a role in what fish are present.If you are unfamiliar with the coastal region you’re visiting, consult with locals about what to expect.
Pay attention to weather forecasts and be cautious in venturing out.
Rip tides can form on any beach with surf, including the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico. They are often found near jetties or between sand bars. If you are caught in a current that pulls you quickly from shore, swim parallel to the beach to break out of it."

Let the rod do the work once you know you have solidly hooked the fish.,
Work the fish closer and closer to you by pulling the rod tip up, then reeling rapidly as you drop the tip down.,
Use the space around you if you are fishing from shore.,
Wear out big fish before landing them on the boat.,
Use the boat to your advantage.,
Use a harness.,
Let the fish run when it is to your advantage.,
For any type of fish or tackle, the line must be always tight so the fish will not throw the hook.,
Stop a running fish when necessary.",How to Reel in a Large Fish," Let the guides, water resistance of the line, line elasticity and drag work together to tire the fish.

Fight the fish with smooth, nonstop pressure, assuming that your reel drag was set correctly.



 


Then start to reel the fish in. Be careful because, depending on the size of the fish, it could snap your line. That's how you reel in a large fish.






The drag if your reel should be set as a percentage of the breaking strength of your main line. For example, if your main line is 50lb test, your drag could be set with a 12lb weight.





;
,

Do not pump the rod too far back, which can cause your rod to break.






Avoid creating slack in the line at any time – this can enable the fish to spit out the hook or break your line.







, When fighting big fish from shore, an alternate technique if the ground is flat, is to walk backwards and to quick reel in the slack when walking forward.

Additionally, you can use this walking method when the fish is big and your rod will break if you pump it back with just your arms.






Generally, when fishing from shore you want to reel the fish in as quickly as possible because there are many objects that can break your line such as rocks, reefs, pilings, drop-offs, caves etc.







, Big game fish can be dangerous; it's better to tire the fish out and avoid bringing it to the boat ""green"".


Do not ""horse"" a big fish in; it will be dangerous to gaff. A marlin is a bit flexible and a green marlin thrashing about when gaffing it is dangerous because of the marlin's bill and the double hook set up that marlin lures have.

, With many big fish, it is best to keep the boat moving forward to keep the fish from heading down. Keep big fish close to the surface.

Marlin will practically die down at the depths and bringing a marlin up from the depths is a terrible experience. Sharks are also a problem when it takes too long to bring in a marlin. A half dead marlin is dead weight, with 300 yards (274.3 m) of line out of the reel, the line elasticity even with a braided line, is enormous. Hauling in a half dead marlin from the depths is like carrying an unconscious person up a ladder; avoid letting marlins go deep at all costs.






Tuna when caught trolling, should also be fought with the boat going forward to avoid having the tuna head for the bottom. A tuna is much stronger than a marlin and fighting a tuna down in the depths, will be exceedingly difficult. Big sharks may also eat the tuna if the fight is too long.







, Fighting big fish from a boat with a harness lets you use the strong muscles of your back, instead of your arms, to pump the rod back. Even without a harness, use your back and body sway to pump the rod backwards, do not use your arm strength to manhandle the heavy trolling tackle.

, Inshore, when you have a big fish on, if the inside has many obstacles to cut the line, let the fish run outside in deep water, before bringing it in for landing.

With the fish exhausted, when you bring it to the landing, crank the reel continuously whether the rod is in the upstroke or down stroke.






The additional advantage of continuous maximum pressure, just before a hairy landing, is to not allow the fish to breathe with its gill flaps.







, Additionally, your motions should be smooth so the hole in the fish's mouth, from the hook, will not get bigger, thus making the hook easier to dislodge.

, In certain do or die situations, it is correct to take a stand and stop a running fish.

When the spool is almost empty, apply pressure on the spinning reel spool with your fingertips. On a big game reel, with your gloved hand, you can thumb the spool sides for extra resistance.






A spool that is almost empty of line has a lot of resistance compared to when the spool is full of line. In this case, you could either chase the fish by turning the boat around and following it, or skipper could put the motor in reverse and go slowly in that direction. With the latter, the fish could go down to the depths and some water could splash into the boat and have to be bailed out.






When the fish is headed for an object, that will almost certainly cut the line, when inshore fishing, is another do or die case. For example, your fish is headed for the reef and your taut line will cut in an instant when it touches the reef, then you should raise the rod high and either tighten the drag or apply pressure to the line in your spinning reel with your forefinger.






In fresh water, the tree stump is the absolute line breaker and you must do everything to stop the fish from going there. Make the fish stop or break the line trying. Lift the rod as much vertically without breaking it at its lower back, put manual pressure on the spool and take few steps backward. Note: the rod as it bends more and more, eventually will bend to above the reel - this is the lower back of the rod.






In brackish water, mangrove roots are as troublesome as tree stumps, so when a fish is headed for mangrove roots, put yourself in the make or break mode. In many cases, there will not be enough time to tighten the drag, adjust the resistance by applying pressure to the spool with your hand.

Find topographic maps that will show contour lines. Also satellite image maps help tremendously with learning the lake; you can even buy maps that download right to you GPS on your boat!
, Don't be afraid to ask other fishermen what they use and where they like to go (preferably not someone you will be fishing against). If you take a map into a bait shop, the people there are often willing to show you on the map where and how they had caught fish in the past. These areas will be great starting points for practice., Just take your maps and the information you have collected from other fishermen from the area and put it all together on the lake. During this time don't forget to make way points and follow your sonar to look for structure, road beds, creek channels, humps, and ledges. Even if these were not mentioned by others, they are still key places to find bass., As any bass angler knows getting on a pattern early in the tournament is key. That's why you are here practicing, to see if we can figure out what the fish want and where they are located. If you can put it all together, you will be a top competitor!"

Mount the reel onto the rod's reel seat.,

Lay out your line spool so the line comes off in the same direction as the reel's bail assembly turns.

,
Thread the line through the rod guides.,

,

,
Reel the line onto the reel spool.",How to Put Fishing String on a Microspin Fishing Pole," While you can load the reel with line off the rod, you'll find it easier to have it mounted on the rod when you crank.


If you'll be using the reel on a longer rod of 6 feet (1.8 m) or more, and the rod is a 2-piece rod, you can leave the upper piece on the rod as long as the section with the reel seat has 1 or more guides. If your rod is a 1-piece rod, or if it's constructed so that the lower section doesn't have any guides, you'll need someone to hold the spool up.;
, Because a Microspin reel is an ultralight reel, you'll want to use line ranging from 2 to 8-pound test (1 to 4 kg class), depending on where you plan to fish.

, You'll want to have the line come off the spool in the same direction the bail assembly turns. If it turns clockwise, the line should feed off the line spool clockwise; if it turns counterclockwise, the line should feel off the line spool counterclockwise. This will prevent the line from twisting on the reel as you fill it.

,, If there are no guides on the rod section your reel is attached to, skip this step.

, This gets it out of the way so you can access the reel spool.

, You can tie the line with an improved clinch, Palomar, or uni-knot, in other words, the same knot you use to tie a hook, swivel, or leader to the other end. Trim the tag end of the line as closely as you can without cutting your knot.

,,, Maintain tension in the line by holding the line between your fingers or against the rod as you reel. This will prevent the line from coiling or knotting as it fills the reel.


Even if the rod or rod section has enough guides, you may find it helpful to have someone hold the line spool up to the same height as the reel. You can run a pencil or thin dowel through the hole in the center of the line spool to make it easier to hold in the correct position and for your assistant to maintain a light tension on the line spool with his or her fingers.

, Continually turn your head and look in all directions because a mask has limited peripheral vision.

, When jabbing at the shark, do not hurt it. Make your fish, appear to be, a part of you by holding them close to your body when the shark swims close.

, The shark just wants your catch and if you get bitten it will be because you were in the shark's way. Sharks do not normally feed on humans.

, Each person keeps an eye out in his area and they stay in the same area (they do not go in separate ways). Two or three people can defend against small sharks but barely so against big sharks. Big sharks, in the Pacific Ocean, are usually tiger sharks.

, Designate the least experienced spear fisherman to be the lookout for sharks, boats and other hazards. The lookout does not spearfish, stays on the surface and continually looks for any potential dangers.

, When a shark gets too aggressive, get out of the water and on the boat.

License your boat.,
Purchase all necessary safety equipment.,
Get an anchor and supporting equipment.,
Carry items to cope with weather conditions.,
Consider other items to help you organize your gear.",How to Prepare a Boat for Fishing1," Most jurisdictions require boats of at least a certain length to be licensed in order to be used on their waters. Licensed boats typically display a sticker identifying the licensing jurisdiction, followed by a series of letters and numbers. In the United States, most states have reciprocal arrangements where a boat licensed in one state may be used in the waters of another state by a visiting boater.


Some states stipulate the appearance of the letter and number stickers that may be used, such as yellow characters on a black background. Check the regulations for your jurisdiction.
If you transport your boat on a trailer, your trailer will need to be licensed as well. While your boat is usually licensed through a state's game and fish commission or department of natural resources, the trailer is typically licensed through the state's department of motor vehicles.;
, To operate a fishing boat, or any other kind of boat, on the water requires having certain pieces of safety equipment on board. Some of it is required by law; other items are just a good idea to have with you. A partial list of items to enhance your safety is given below.


Life jackets/personal flotation devices. Most jurisdictions require a life jacket or other PFD for each passenger aboard and for children below a certain age to be wearing theirs. It's a good idea to wear your life jacket at all times on the water even if the law doesn't require it, which means selecting a comfortable life jacket you will want to wear. (You'll want a life jacket slightly larger than your jacket size so that you can wear it over a jacket; you can adjust it to fit more snugly when not wearing it over a jacket.)
Kill switch. If your boat has an outboard or inboard-outboard motor, a kill switch clipped to your belt and to the engine will shut it off if you're thrown from the boat. Many jurisdictions require a kill switch for boats with motors above a certain horsepower.
Fire extinguisher. Having a fire extinguisher near the motor will help to quickly put out an engine fire if it occurs. Check the laws for your jurisdiction as to whether an extinguisher is required and what type.
Rope. You'll need rope to tie your boat to the dock as well as for your anchor. You should also have a tow rope in case you get stranded in the middle of the lake or to help someone who does.
Signaling devices. Such things as an air horn, whistle, flags, or flares can alert others to your predicament when in distress or sound a warning in foggy conditions. Check the laws for your jurisdiction as to what devices are required.
Weather radio. This can alert you to upcoming changes in the weather before you note the changes in the sky, wind, and water choppiness.
You may also want to buy a cell phone if you don't already have one, as you can use it to call for help while out on the water.
If you plan to fish from your boat at night, you'll need to have night-time running lights, which typically include red and green lights for the bow and a white light for the stern. Check with your jurisdiction as to the type of lights required for your size of boat.

, You'll need to have an anchor for those times when you want to keep your boat in the same place when fishing, and you'll also need equipment to support it.


The 3 main anchor types used for fishing are the plow-style and Danforth anchors, which feature blades or flukes that dig into the bottom, and the mushroom anchor, named for its shape, which holds primarily due to its weight. A good rule of thumb is to have 1 pound (2.2 kg) of anchor weight for every foot of boat length. You may have multiple anchors, with your bow anchor serving as the primary anchor and the heaviest anchor of the group.
You'll want to have enough nylon anchor rope to have from 5 to 7 times the distance from the anchor cleat to the bottom. As this can be a lot of rope, a windlass to keep the rope on will keep it from fouling around your feet when not paid out. You'll also need a cleat or housing for the anchor to rest on when not in the water.
Instead of tying the anchor line directly to your anchor, use a length of galvanized chain of 3 to 6 feet (0.9 to 1.8 m) to take the wear and tear caused by dragging the anchor over the bottom before it catches.

, The weather can change suddenly while you're out on the water. It helps to be prepared; the following items can help:


Polarized sunglasses can protect your eyes from glare on the water and help you see under the surface to avoid submerged stumps, brush, and rocks.
Sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or better, in conjunction with wearing long pants and long sleeves, will help protect you from sunburn.
Foul weather gear, such as a waterproof rain parka, will help keep you drier if it rains suddenly while you're out on the lake.

, Rod holders and tie-downs for other items, such as landing nets, will keep those items from shifting around as the boat moves, keeping you from losing them in a sudden turn or from accidental injury from a rod tip or fish hook.

Renew your boat and trailer licenses.,
Inspect the boat for signs of wear.,
Inspect your motor.,
Inspect the boat trailer.,
Inspect and replace any necessary safety equipment.,
Consider a professional inspection.",How to Prepare a Boat for Fishing2," These usually have to be renewed each year.

, Clean the inside and outside hull of any barnacles or debris, and look for dents or cracks in it, particularly on the bottom and around rivets. Also inspect the drain plug to make sure it still seals the drain hole properly and that any onboard lights and electronics work correctly.

, Test the engine to make sure it runs and there are no fluid leaks, replace any necessary parts, and in the case of inboard or larger outboard motors with 4-cycle engines, change the oil. Also, clean the propeller of any debris and make sure it turns freely. Inspect the crank battery for your main motor and the deep-cycle battery for your trolling motor for leaks and to make sure they hold a charge.

, Make sure the wheels and tires are in good shape, along with the winch and pads. Be sure the trailer taillights work as well.

, Check all life jackets for any tears and your children's to see that they still fit. Check the batteries in your weather radio and that your fire extinguishers are properly filled and in working order.

, If you don't have the time to inspect your boat yourself, or if you notice something you're not sure is a problem, you can have your boat inspected by a mechanic or outdoor retailer equipped to do inspections. Boats used for saltwater fishing can be inspected by marine surveyors accredited by either the National Association of Marine Surveyors or the Society of Accredited Marine Surveyors.

Be prepared to be netting for someone else.,

Reel your own line in as quickly as you can.,

Wait until you are asked before getting the net.,

Once the angler has requested the net, grab it and make sure it is ready.,

Once you have determined which side of the boat the fish will be coming to, get the net into the water.,

Do not jab at the fish with the net.,

Turn the net so that it offers the largest possible entry to the fish.
,

As soon as the fish is past the rim of the net, lift it out with a slight scooping motion.,

Bring the net into the boat.",How to Net a Fish," Most of the time when a net is required, you will be netting for someone else. When your partner gets a fish on, be ready to drop what you are doing and get the net.
, If you just set the rod down, you are going to lose it., If the angler just wants to swing the fish over the side, you'll be in the way if you are standing there with a big net., Some nets have collapsible handles, so make sure that the net is completely secure and ready for service., Submerge as much of the rim of the net as you can, but leave some of it out so that the angler can clearly see where he needs to get the fish., Simply leave the net in the water and allow the angler to lead it in.,, If the fish is large, do not scoop, rather hold the handle of the net in a vertical fashion and lift the net out of the water., Don't place it on the front or back deck where the fish could get back into the water with a single leap. The bottom of the boat is much safer."

, This means you need at least two special refrigerators. By special, this means that they shouldn't exceed 4 feet (1.2 m) tall, and will need to have a glass or see-through door.

, Tell them that you are going to open a shop and they can have a bit of money for finding worms. You will later go through these and sort them by size and fairly label them with a price tag. Keep this offer going for as long as you are open.

, Buy at least 30 packages of each type and size. If a bait type comes in multiple colors, buy only the practical ones. That means yellow, glow-in-the-dark, silver, red and green. Don't worry about cost; ask a bank for a loan to cover just this.

, This means that if you buy a 50 packs of yellow rubber worms for 20 dollars, you need to make at least 50 dollars return.

, This can be done before opening, using a survey. Hint: Most people will tell you what they like if you offer them a coupon.

, Just put all your rubber flies, jigs and baits in their respective containers, with a label for each individual price.

, Also, only buy specialty worms from the live bait section. Many people buy earthworms, only to have some kid ask if they can get paid for finding worms.

Find a suitable piece of bamboo cane.,
Trim and smooth the cane.,
Leave the cane to dry.,
Attach the fishing line.,
Attach the hook, bobber and sinker.",How to Make a Homemade Fishing Rod1," Find a piece of bamboo cane that’s between 8 and 10 feet long and 1 and 2 inches in diameter and cut it at the base.


When it comes to bamboo fishing pole, bigger is not necessarily better. Larger poles can be cumbersome to hold and awkward to transport.
It’s probably best to cut three or four pieces of bamboo at a time, in case your first piece breaks after you’ve dried it out and you have to begin the process again;
, Use a small sharp knife to trim away any leaves or nubs, as close to the main body of the cane as possible.


Find a joint at the thicker end of the cane and saw through it. This will ensure that the butt of your fishing pole has a closed end.
Take a piece of sandpaper and used it to smooth the body of the fishing pole as much as possible.

, The next step is to dry out the cane pole. Tie a piece of string around the narrow end of the pole and suspend it from the ceiling. This will ensure that the cane dries evenly and as straight as possible.


Dry the cane pole in a warm, dry place but do not exposed it to direct sunlight. Sunlight will dry out the cane too quickly, causing it to become brittle.
Depending on temperature and humidity levels, the cane will take a few weeks to several months to dry out fully. You will know it’s ready when it turns a tan color.
When the cane is dry pick it up and give it a few test swings through the air to make sure it doesn’t break or bend. If it does, try another piece.
You want your fishing pole to be as straight as possible, so if it dries with a slight curve you can straighten it out by weighting it with bricks.

, Take some 20 pound Dacron line and tie one end a couple of inches above the “handle” of the fishing pole.Run the line along the length of the pole until you get to the end. Then take some extra pieces of fishing line and use them to tie the running line to the fishing pole at two or three different points (including the tip).
Be careful when tying the running line to the pole -- if it’s tied too tightly you won’t be able to slide the line up and down, but if it’s tied too loosely the line will droop and get tangled. Use a whip-finish if possible.
The length of the fishing line (from the tip of the pole) should measure the total length of the pole, plus an extra two feet. If you prefer, the extra two feet can be monofilament leader instead of the Dacron line.

, Attach your preferred hook or lure to the end of the line along with a bobber and a split-shot sinker.


Now your homemade bamboo fishing pole is ready to use! To shorten the line, pull it back through the loops and wrap the excess around the handle."

Cut two PVC pipes.,
Attach the slip caps and threaded connectors.,
Drill holes into the smaller PVC pipe.,
Attach the eyelets.,
Attach a premade fishing reel to the larger pipe.,
Screw the PVC pipes together.",How to Make a Homemade Fishing Rod2," Take two pieces of PVC piping -- one ½ an inch in diameter and the other ¾ of an inch.


Use a saw to cut the PVC pipes to the desired length. Keep in mind that the combined length of the two PVC pipes will be the approximate length of your finished fishing rod.
For example, for a small child-size fishing rod you could cut each pipe to a length of 10 inches (25.4 cm).
Use some sandpaper to smooth the sawed edges and remove any markings from the body of the pipes.

, You will need two slip caps: one ¾ inch and one ½ inch fitting.


You will also need a ¾ inch to ½ inch threaded connector (female/male) and a ½ inch to ½ inch threaded connector (female/female).
These fittings are available very cheaply from the hardware store. Slip each fitting onto the corresponding piece of pipe, but do not glue in place.

, Take a power drill with a 3⁄32 inch (0.2 cm) drill bit and drill 3 to 5 holes all the way through the ½ inch PVC pipe.


The number of holes will depend on the length of the pipe you are using. No matter how many holes you make, ensure that they evenly spaced.

, Take a number of medium sized binder clips (to match the number of holes you drilled) and remove the silver wire from the clip.


Use a pliers to bend one leg of the silver wire across the other. When you’re done, there should be a closed loop on one end of the wire and on the other end the legs should point inwards towards each other. Repeat with the other wires.
Take a wire and clip the legs into the holes on either side of the ½ inch pipe. The loop at the end of the wire forms an eyelet for the fishing line. Repeat with the other wires.

, Buy a premade fishing reel and attach it to the side of the larger ¾ inch PVC pipe.


You can do this by using the same drill bit as before to make two holes in the side of the pipe, then screw the fishing reel into place

, The last step is to screw the two pieces of PVC pipe together to form your fishing rod and run the fishing line through the eyelets. Attach a hook, bobber and sinker to the end of the line.


The great thing about this fishing rod is that you can remove the slip caps from either end of the rod to store tackle or anything else you want!

, Take a piece of string that’s about 20 feet (6.1 m) long and tie it to the narrower end of the stick, about 4 inches (10.2 cm) from the end.


Make sure the knot is nice and tight. Wrap the remaining string around the end of the stick.
Tie two to three feet of thin fishing line to the end of the string, as this will make it easier to attach the hook.

, Thread a small fishing hook onto the end of the line. When it’s time to fish, unwind enough string from the end of the pole for the hook to reach the required depth."

Understand how environmental factors affect fish.,
Find ""Structure."",
Take Salinity and Oxygen measurements.,
Measure the water temperature.,
Use a boat.,
Choose the Methods that Suit You Best.,
Pick the best spot for you.,
Know the best time to fish.,
Pick the best season.,
Successful anglers know the habits and availability of the different species.",How to Locate Salt Water Fish," Not all fish can live in the same kinds of waters. Different species need different sets of environmental conditions, including:


Hiding areas, cover, structure, and the bottom
Salinity
Dissolved oxygen
Water temperature
Types and amounts of food
Tides and currents
Water depth;
, Many fish species such as striped bass and grouper live or hold near structure. Structure refers to changes in the shape of the bottom caused by rocks, reefs, man-made objects, humps, ledges, and drop-offs. Structure causes fish to concentrate in certain areas. Estuaries and river mouths may have shoreline structures such as docks, logs, stump fields, brush, rock piles, grass beds, and downed trees that provide shelter, shade, and protection for fish. Islands, sand bars, rock piles, and jetties are also good places to fish. Fish inhabit certain types of cover because it provides them with protection and puts them in the best possible position to catch a meal.

, Some fish species like brook trout cannot live with much salt in the water, other fish, such as tuna, need salt, and some, such as striped bass, can live in salt or freshwater. Fish also need a certain amount of oxygen in the water. Species such as carp can live on less oxygen than trout. Living plants add oxygen to the water as does moving water tumbling over rocks. Decomposing plants and animals use oxygen from the water and many kinds of pollution also reduce oxygen levels. Thermal pollution may also be a problem, as warmer water cannot hold as much oxygen as cold water.

, Each fish species has a specific range of water temperature that it enjoys. Tarpon can thrive in waters as warm as 85 °F (29 °C), while salmon and cod must have cooler 50s, 40s, and even 30s. Some fish tolerate a wide range of temperatures; others have very narrow requirements. Serious anglers find that a thermometer is a useful accessory for knowing when to try for specific kinds of fish.

, Fishing from a boat enables you to cover more water than fishing from shore. You can reach distant spots, frequently with deeper water, and use a range of techniques and tactics not available to the landlubbers. Different types of boats work best in different types of water and for performing different tasks. Canoes, skiffs, and johnboats can be ideal for casual fishing on quiet estuaries, back bays, and tidal creeks. Larger rivers, open water, and more extreme fishing demand more powerful V-hulls, ""cathedral"" hulls, or specialty sport fishing boats.

, Knowing which angling approach to use, and when to use it, is critical to having a successful day on the water. Locate a good tackle shop and ask a lot of questions. Buy a good chart of the area and study it for cuts and channels, holes or humps, all the good places that might hold fish. Maybe even hire a guide. A day spent fishing with a guide is one of the best ways to improve your technique.

, Once you find the fish, getting them to bite your hook becomes the challenge. Each of the various types of fishing lends itself to catching certain kinds of fish. Surf fishing usually lands a good variety of species, without the need for an ocean-going boat. Most any healthy beach can offer good surf fishing, but pay particular attention to rocky beaches, rock jetties, and fishing piers. A typical surf fishing setup matches an 8 or 9 foot (2.4 or 2.7 m) rod and reel with 14 to 20 pound test line, although longer rods make longer casts. For many anglers, however, pier fishing can be the best possible way to spend the best possible day. Some piers stand over or near reefs or underwater structures that shelter numerous residents and draw schools of migratory fish. Pier fishing is a relatively comfortable way to introduce children to marine angling as the piers attract many smaller fish for the kids as well as larger species for the adults. Many piers also have the amenities and facilities families enjoy.

, There is no single best time to fish. Like so much in this sport, different species are active at different times, and those active periods vary in response to a host of environmental factors. In general, marine fish seem to be more active shortly after dawn and at dusk, and least active around Noon and early afternoon. Nevertheless, you can still catch fish at Noon if you understand what the fish are doing and adjust your angling tactics

, Just like trying to determine the best time of day to fish, determining the best season requires that you understand what the fish are doing and adjust your tactics to respond. Fishing can be a year-round sport, but obviously, certain seasons will be more comfortable than others.

, A range of environmental variables determines which fish will be in an area at any given time. Temperature, amount of daylight, predation, and food availability are key factors. Striped bass storm the mid Atlantic flats in the warming spring; salmon invade the creeks of Alaska’s Kenai in the long days of summer and early fall; and false albacore storm the early winter surf off Cape Hatteras. Some species and some venues may also have times of the year when it is illegal to fish. Many states have closed seasons when various species are spawning. Successful anglers understand how all the factors affect their chances of catching a particular species.

Fish with the guides aligned to reduce wear on your line.,
Avoid banging your rod on the boat, rocks or other surfaces.,
Clean your rod with a cloth, lukewarm water and vinegar or mild detergent every time you finish fishing.,
Rub the rod's joints with candle wax or paraffin to prevent friction.,
Wear gloves while you fish if your rod has a cork handle.,
Fill small holes with a mixture of cork filings and wood glue or wood putty.

",How to Maintain a Fishing Rod1," The guides are the metal rings that hold the line to the rod.

Sand nicks in guide rings to prevent the line from breaking when you have a fish on. If you cannot get the nick out by sanding with fine sandpaper, replace the guide. Examine the guides with a magnifying glass and pass a cotton ball through the rings. Cotton will catch if there is a nick you cannot see with a magnifying glass.



 


Check for rust on the guide rings and the reel seat -- where the reel attaches. If there is rust, replace the guide ring. Sand rust off the reel seat with fine sandpaper and repaint.





;
, Rods are relatively fragile, and even small nicks or scratches can result in breakage.

, If your rod is soiled, remove the dirt with a soft-bristle brush or a toothbrush. Allow the rod to dry completely before putting it away.


Take extra care to clean your angling rod if you have been fishing in saltwater, as there is a higher chance of corrosion.

, The joints, also known as ferrules, are the places where the separate sections of the rod join.

, Oils in your skin may cause the cork to wear out sooner.


If your cork handle is already worn, wet the rod grip and sand the cork grip with fine, waterproof sandpaper. Then, put some soap on the sandpaper and gently rub the cork. Rinse off the soap and let the grip dry. Be careful not to rub the rod itself with the sandpaper.

,"
"
Store your rod on a rod rack that can be mounted vertically or horizontally.,
Loosen the drag before storing your rod and reel so the line does not break or pull on the rod.

,
Remove the fishing line from your rod and reel before storage if you have been fishing in saltwater.

",How to Maintain a Fishing Rod2," Storing a rod improperly may result in damage or curvature. If you do not have a rack, store the rod on a hanger or nail in a closet.

Keep your rod and reel away from salt, dirt and other substances that may harm the rod, both while fishing and while storing the rod.






It is better not to store your rod in a rod tube, as tubes trap moisture, which can corrode the guide rings, the reel or the reel seat.

, Successful fly fishermen learn to ""match the hatch."" Study a chart of what insects are hatching in your area at a certain time, and buy according to the schedule.

, These relatively new rods are easier to wield. The majority of your action should be confined to your dominant arm and shoulder.

, Hold it in the center of the grip with your thumb up.


Place your line between your first finger and the fly rod. Pull 8 to 10 yards (7.3 to 9.1 m) of extra line. Cast your line horizontally using your thumb and wrist to flick toward your target.

, Stiff muscles will lead to short, ineffective casting. Master forward casting in a relaxed way before attempting back casting.

, Reeling in a catch in fly fishing is very similar to spinning, but putting together a reel will help you to understand different line weights. Once you are very familiar with your reels you will be better at reeling in slowly, smoothly and successfully.

Avoid fishing in Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).,
Never “fin” sharks.,
Make sure you can identify the shark species you're likely to encounter.",How to Kill a Shark1," Just as you would for any kind of fishing, if you hope to go out fishing for sharks, you need to register with the Department of Wildlife or the Hunting and Fishing Service in your area to make it legal. In most places, there is no ""shark season,"" but other fishing guidelines and restrictions may apply in your area.


To catch sharks in the United States, you need to apply for a National Marine Fisheries Service license with the Department of Hunting and Wildlife, found here.;
, The regulations for hunting sharks vary widely depending on the region you’re in. In some areas, including the Bay off California, there is no “shark season,” while in Massachusetts, minimum weight requirements and seasons for blues, makos, and threshers are strictly enforced. It's critical that you get informed about the local regulations by getting information from the Department of Marine Wildlife in your area to make sure any fishing expedition you've got planned is legal.


In the US, blue sharks are the most frequently caught variety of shark, typically taken on deep-sea fishing expeditions off chartered boats. If you want to go shark fishing, this is typically the best way to do it. You'll be sure you're fishing for the right sharks and can quickly identify the legal species, with pros there to help you.
Look for shark fishing tournaments in your area. In some regions, marine biologists and fishermen have teamed up to experience the thrill of the hunt and the knowledge that can come from interacting with sharks up close and then releasing them safely back into the wild. These types of fishing tournaments are a healthy and legal coming-together of science and sport., Depending on where you’re fishing, certain shark species may be more present than others, while certain species are universally outlawed for harvesting.It is universally illegal to kill any of the following species of shark:


Tiger shark
Whale sharks
Great whites
Atlantic angel
Basking
Bigeye sand tiger, six- or seven gills, and threshers
Bignose
Caribbean reef
Dusky
Galapagos
Great, scalloped, or smooth hammerheads
Lemon shark
Longfin mako
Narrow tooth
Night
Sandbar
Sand tiger
Silky
Small tail

, In the United States, attempts are being made to coordinate areas identified locally as being target areas for conservation and research, to bring these areas under government oversight. Because maritime law is somewhat more complex than the law of the land, it's been a challenge to make shark-hunting or fishing laws applicable across a wide variety of locations and waters. The introduction of MPAs seeks to simplify that. You can keep up to date with fishing restricted national waters by clicking here.

, The most valuable part of the shark is usually the fins, which are used in many different cultural cuisines as the basis for a soup stock. Because of this, the practice of ""finning"" sharks–cutting off their fins and tossing the carcasses, often still alive, back into the water–is almost universally illegal, not to mention morally bankrupt.While the practice is done mostly on species that are already restricted, finning sharks is illegal, regardless of the species, and trading in shark fins is increasingly restricted and illegal all over the world. Even if you hope to use the fins for soup, you need to take the whole shark and dress it using a humane method.

, If you can't tell a tiger from a blue, you need to get your fishing line out of the water. Invest in a good shark field guide and mark the variety of legal sharks, so you can quickly reference them while you're out fishing and make sure any sharks that you see are legal, or quickly identify any sharks that you've brought on board.


Since sharks are usually underwater, obviously, giving a positive ID can be difficult. Mostly, identifying sharks is about examining the notches and coloring of the fins and looking at the distance between the dorsal fin and the tail, to get a sense of how long it is. Knowing the geography, the length of the shark, and seeing the dorsal is enough for experts to identify the shark correctly."

Get the right sea-fishing gear.,
Use the right bait.,
Find a good spot.,
Lay out a chum slick.,
Wait for a bite and get ready for the fight.,
Practice catch and release.,
Kill the shark humanely, if you must.",How to Kill a Shark2," Sharks need to be caught using heavy-duty deep sea poles and line with a high tensile strength. Try to keep it as light as possible, and try to use lightweight rod and reel combos specifically designed for braided monofilament. If you charter a fishing boat to go shark fishing, gear should be provided for you.Fishing harnesses to lock yourself in and secure you to the boat are also common in shark fishing. Worn like seat belts, these will lock you in place for the long-haul.
Use circle hooks instead of J-hooks. To make catch and release easier, use circle hooks, which tend to get caught nicely in the shark's jaw, making them easy to remove and relatively painless. J-hooks can get lodged in the shark's stomach, making releasing the shark extremely difficult., Sharks are predators, meaning that you've got to throw something tasty and bloody in the water to get them going. The most common bait used in fishing for sharks is usually jackfish, mackerel, mullet, whiting, sandtrout, or ladyfish, though different regions often will have specific bait fish local to the area that the sharks are used to hunting. Go out with experienced deep sea fishermen to get a sense of the best bait for the job.


Try to rig your bait live, through the lips. Sharks are attracted to the smell of blood and also to signs of struggle, making live bait ideal for attracting sharks.

, Sharks are commonly hunted from chartered fishing boats, off piers, and even off shore, depending on where you’re fishing. Talk to local anglers to find out where the best places to catch sharks are and post up with your gear.


Look for ledges and rip lines. Shipwrecks, deep underwater drop-offs, and other unusual underwater textures are great habitats for hunting sharks. If you want to attract sharks, look for places with dynamic underwater landscapes. Rip lines or little disturbances in the water can suggest underwater feeding frenzies, the presence of schools of baitfish, and generally just good underwater action. That means it's a good place to lay some chum.

, Most commercial fishermen will bring as much as 5 gallons (18.9 L) of bluefish or bunker to make ""chum,"" which is a crude slurry of stinky chopped up baitfish that sharks love. Typically placed in bags and hung off the bow and the stern of the boat, this chum attracts schools of sharks reliably and quickly. And they'll be hungry.

, Since you're boat fishing, most commercial boats will set up the rods and wait for signs of a bite. If you're out on a chartered boat, put your line in the water, crack open a cold one, and enjoy the sunshine until you see the line being taken out. You should notice and hear the line start to be taken out rapidly. Once you get a bite, clear all the other lines out of the water and cut the engines to get ready for the fight.


After the shark takes the line, wait about five or ten seconds before setting the line, pulling sharply on it with two quick pumps and reeling it until taut. This should set the hook in the thickest part of the shark's jaw, where it will be secure. Continue reeling in part way and letting it fight the line back out. Keep the engines on and stay ready for the endgame.
Bringing the shark into the shallows to ""ground it"" can be an effective way of tiring out the shark and giving it less opportunity to dive. Depending on where you are, this can be an effective technique.
If you've been wrestling with a shark for 20 or 30 minutes and intend to release it eventually, some fishermen prefer cutting the shark loose, as opposed to continuing to fight it and wear it out. Over-tiring the shark can endanger its health and its ability to recover from the fight. Consider cutting him loose.

, Remove the tackle in the water to decrease the stress on the shark as much as possible, holding the shark firmly by the dorsal fin and the mid-torso, and pulling the hook loose with pliers. Then let the shark go.


If you don't want to release, larger sharks need to be gaffed, and the whole group needs to coordinate to make the process as safe as possible. In this process, the shark needs to be brought up alongside the boat and allowed to calm down some. The first thing to bring out of the water is the tail, which is the part that can shoot the shark off in a new direction, and typically this is done using a winch and tail rope. Typically, the shark will be left to hang like that for as much as an hour, to avoid lots of threshing and moving around inside the boat, which can be extremely dangerous.There’s little reason to hunt sharks for keeps. There's little to no meat and the thrill can be gotten more from looking at them up close. Hunt something regulated and with a more secure population, like swordfish, marlin, or other deep-sea fish if you want to keep animals.
Most arguments that the culling of populations in Australia can help to keep swimmers safe have been debunked. Shark attacks, on an uptick in some areas, can be attributed to changing patterns in fish migrations moving closer to populated shores, which is in turn attributable to global climate change, not rising populations of hostile sharks.

, The quickest way to kill a shark is to use a sharp knife, at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) long, to stab the shark’s brain. To do this, stab through the back of the head, 2-3 in. behind the eyes, slicing forward. This is extremely difficult, since the shark’s brain is very small.


Stabbing the shark in the gills will kill the shark eventually, but although this is a mortal wound, it’s an inhumane method of killing the shark.
There's little reason to kill sharks, because the dwindling populations are already in constant threat from human intrusion. If you want to kill sharks, the best way to do it is to continue polluting the oceans. If you want to fish, practice catch and release.

Pay attention to beach closings and warnings.,
Stay out of the water during hunting times.,
If you see a shark, lock your eyes on it.,
Find a weapon.,
Hit the shark in its soft spots.,
Get out of the water and seek medical attention.",How to Kill a Shark3," Before you make a trip all the way to Cape Cod or Australia, make sure the beaches you hope to visit are open and shark-free. Typically, areas that experience a rise in shark sightings or attacks will close beaches nearby. If beaches are closed, avoid them. Check in with the board of tourism in the state with the beaches you hope to visit to find out about shark incidents and beach closings.

, Sharks are crepuscular hunters, which means that they get hungry at dawn and at dusk. If you're in the water just as the sun comes up, or right as it goes down, that's shark time. It's best to avoid waters that you suspect might be busy with hungry sharks early in the morning and just before dark.

, When you're out swimming, keep yourself focused on the shark at all times, whether you're just paddling around or underwater scuba diving. Stay calm and focused, and avoid making sudden jerks or movements, which will attract the shark in to your struggle.


If you're between the shark and open water, clear a space by moving out of the way. Most sharks don't want anything to do with you. Your best option, when you spot a shark, is to slowly start making your way toward the boat or the shore, whichever is closer. Make long, smooth strokes and keep your eyes on the shark.
If you can, look for some cover. Backing up against a rock ledge, coral reef, or some other outcropping with take away certain angles of attack. Keep yourself in a defensive position.

, A good quality stainless steel knife comes in handy if you're facing the prospect of a shark attack, but most of us don't carry around Bowie knives on our wetsuits. If not, you'll have to improvise. You can attempt to gouge out the shark's eyes, or punch it in the nose repeatedly. Something heavy can also help you stun the shark, if you use it in the right spots. Good improvised weapons might include:


A shoe
A rock
Cameras
Goggles or masks
Other scuba gear

, Though they make look scary, sharks have just as many vulnerabilities as any human. A properly timed and placed hit with the right pressure on one of those spots will send the shark away quickly, without having to kill it. Make short, quick jabs at the eyes and the gills of the shark to cause the most damage and make yourself seem less desirable as a snack.


The underside of the shark's jaw can also be a sensitive spot, and some trainers can even manipulate the shark to zonk it out by tickling the shark's ""chin.""
The very tip of the shark's nose is another sensitive spot. Throw a couple of hard, sharp jabs straight at it and don't stop hitting until it leaves you alone.

, Go to the water's surface and look around for a boat or shore. If you see a boat, call to it calmly. If you see shore, slowly swim there. The shark might come back, so swim quickly, but not too quickly as to alarm the shark. If you've been injured, seek medical attention immediately.

Decide whether this method is right for your worms.,
Place the worms in an opaque plastic or Styrofoam container.If you use a clear plastic container, light will filter through the soil and confuse the worms.,
Feed your worms about once a week.,
Store them in the refrigerator.",How to Keep Fishing Worms Alive for Fishing1," This technique works best for small amounts of worms that will be used within a month. For example, if you bought a small cup of worms for a fishing trip and didn’t use all of them, you can store them in the refrigerator until your next trip.


If you have a large box with over one thousand worms, you need to store your worms in a worm box instead.;
, Make sure you include any soil or newspaper shreds that came with your bait.


If the worms were purchased in a suitable container you don’t need to move them.

, Sprinkle two to three tablespoons of used, damp coffee grounds into their container. Try to evenly distribute the coffee grounds throughout the cup.You can also feed them powdered worm food by sprinkling a few teaspoons over the top layer of worms.


Powdered worm food can be purchased at most bait supply shops.
Wait until all of the food has been eaten before feeding the worms again. If you over-feed them, they will die.

, Close the container to retain moisture and place your worms in the refrigerator. Check on your stored worms every few days to make sure they’re well-fed and the bedding is moist. If needed, sprinkle a few drops of water into the container to hydrate the worm bedding.

"
"
Prepare a large plastic bin.,
Fill the box with soil.,
Dump the worms into the worm box.,
Store the worm box in a cool, shady place.",How to Keep Fishing Worms Alive for Fishing2," Choose a bin that’s large enough for all of your worms. You should provide at least one square foot of space for every 1,000 worms.Drill holes in the sides and bottom of the bin to allow water to drain well.Buy large plastic concrete mixing bins at your local hardware store or purchase a plastic storage bin at a container supply store.
You can also build your own wooden worm box.


, You can either purchase commercial worm bedding or use potting soil. The soil should be moist but not wet. If the soil is too wet, the worms will suffocate. To test the moisture of the soil, grab a handful of soil and squeeze it. Properly moist soil will only release a few drops of water.If too much water is released, let the soil dry some before adding the worms.
If the soil is too dry, spray on some water and mix it in with your hands.

, The worms will find their own way into the dirt. This process may take an hour or so. If a few hours pass and the worms are still on the surface of the worm box, your soil may be too wet or you may have put too many worms into your box.

, If possible, bury the worm box in a shady spot outside, leaving about two inches of the box above ground. If you can’t store the worms outside, keep them under your kitchen sink, in your basement, or in a closet."
"
Feed them about once a week.,
Harvest your worms at least once a month.To do so, simply reach into the worm box and gently scoop out a handful of worms.,
Change out the soil every 3-6 months.",How to Keep Fishing Worms Alive for Fishing3," You can purchase a powdered worm food from a bait supply store or make your own worm food by blending fruit and veggie scraps, coffee grounds, or eggshells. To feed the worms, sprinkle a light layer the worm food over the top of the worm box. Wait until all of the food has been eaten before feeding them again.Don’t mix the food into the soil. This can harm your worms.
Avoid feeding your worms citrus fruits, spicy food, meat and dairy products, bread, and oil.

, Place the worms in a covered container, taking care to keep the majority of the soil in the worm box. Either take the worms fishing immediately or store them in the refrigerator for up to a week.


Discard any leftover worms from your fishing trip by releasing them into a shady section of your garden.
Harvest worms before feeding them to avoid mixing the food into the soil., If you don’t, the worms will get sick and die. Remove all of the worms from the worm box into a bucket. Next, scoop out all of the old soil or bedding and replace it with new moist soil. Once you’ve finished, dump the worms back into the worm box.Wait for the worms to reintegrate into the soil before feeding them again.
The old dirt can be used as a fertilizer in your garden.

Submit your application before the deadline.",How to License Your Commercial Fishing Business with the NOAA Fisheries Service," NOAA has five regional offices that issue and administer permits to fish in those waters. Your regional office will have information on permit requirements and how to maintain your permit once it is issued.The five regional offices cover the Alaska, Greater Atlantic, Pacific Islands, Southeast, and West Coast regions.
If you're fishing on the high seas, you'll need a high seas permit in addition to permits for any regions where you plan to fish.
For example, if you're fishing in the Pacific Ocean, you potentially would need permits for the West Coast Region, the Alaska Region, and the Pacific Islands region as well as a High Seas permit.
Fishing in the Alaska Region also may require your vessel to be listed under other treaties or compacts to give you permission to fish in Canadian or Russian waters.
If you contact the nearest regional office and explain where you are fishing, they can let you know which permits you'll need.;
, NOAA offers web access for many of the forms and permit applications you will need to obtain and maintain your commercial fishing permit. In addition to national forms, there also are region-specific forms available.Some of these forms are fillable PDFs, while others are web-based forms that you can complete and transmit online.
Forms that are not conducive to online transmission may be available to download and print.
The forms portal also has contact emails for each of the regional offices and individuals within those offices who handle specific types of applications.

, The forms you need depend on where you intend to fish and the kinds of fish you intend to catch. If you're fishing on the high seas and crossing through several regions, you may need to get permits for each region.The best way to be sure you're getting all the permits you need is to talk to someone in your nearest regional office and tell them about your commercial fishing operation.
While permits are required to take some types of fish, this doesn't mean that if you don't get a permit for a type of fish you aren't allowed to take it. Fish other than those you're primarily targeting may end up in your nets, but your allowable catch numbers will be different.
Keep in mind that fishing in an area without the proper permits can result in stiff fines as well as possible jail time.

, All forms must be filled out completely with information about your fishing vessel, its ownership, the types of fish you're taking, and your fishing methods. Some sections may require you to submit additional documentation.The main form you'll need to fill out is an application for a Federal Fisheries Permit (FFP). Although each region has its own FFP application, the information you must provide is the same for all. However, the types of fish listed on each region's FFP will be different.
You must be a U.S. citizen to get an FFP in any region.
Include information about your vessel, including the complete name of the vessel and the name, address, and phone number of the owner. If there is more than one owner, list the principal owner first.
You also will need to include the home port of your vessel, its U.S. Coast Guard documentation number, and other registration numbers. Write the overall length and registered length in feet, and attach a color photograph of the vessel to your application.
The application also requires information about the types of gear you have on board your vessel and the fish you intend to take using that gear.

, Your permit application and supporting documentation must be sent to the NOAA regional office that administers permits for those waters, along with the required fees. Applications for multiple regions must be sent to each separate office.Typically you must either submit your application online or mail it using U.S. mail. Most regional offices permit the use of express mail if you want to get your application there sooner.
Your application must be accompanied by the appropriate fee, which will differ depending on the type of permit you seek. For example, the fee for a high seas permit is $129.
If you're mailing your application, pay your fee with a check or money order made payable to the U.S. Department of Commerce – NOAA. You can use a credit or debit card for online submissions.
Your permit will be active for between one and three years from the date of issuance, depending on the type of permit it is.

, The appropriate regional office will send you the official logbook for that year within two weeks after your permit is issued. If you don't receive the correct logbook within that period, you must contact the regional office responsible for issuing your permit.Logbooks for the upcoming year are sent out to permit holders each December.
If you have more than one permit, you may have several logbooks that must be used for each permit. Label your logbooks carefully and make sure you're entering the correct information in the correct logbook.
You also will receive supplies including envelopes for mailing logbook entries and reports back to the regional office.

, When you go on a fishing trip, use the logbook to promptly record the number of fish of each type that you catch and the gear used to catch those fish.You must log all species of fish that you catch. If a particular species of fish isn't listed, there are blank spaces towards the bottom of the logbook page and the report form that you can use to log and report those fish.

, Each time you go on a fishing trip, you must complete a trip report recording the fish you caught and sold, the price for which you sold those fish, and the gear you used to catch them..The top part of your trip report requires you to enter your vessel name, identifying numbers, and information about your trip, including when you started and finished, how many days you were at sea, and the number of people on your crew.
In addition to the basic trip reports, a percentage of permit holders are selected at random to report economic information regarding the trip expenses and payment. This information can be entered on the same form as your trip report.
The gear section includes information on each type of gear, including traps, longline, gill net, and reels. You must list the number of traps or lines used, the number of hooks per line (in the case of long lines or reels), and the total hours fished.

, Each trip report must be filed with the regional office within seven days. If you don't go on any fishing trips for an entire month, you must fill out and submit a ""no fishing"" activity form within seven days following the end of the month.All reports should be sent to the same address for your regional office. You may be provided with pre-addressed envelopes for this purpose.
You can contact the regional office's logbook program at any time to confirm that your logbooks and reports are up to date with the office.
If you need the catch history for your vessel, you can fill out a catch history request form and submit it to your regional office. You will receive a report that summarizes the catch history of your vessel under that permit.

, Since logbook entries and reports are the main reason renewal permits may be delayed, make sure you've submitted the required documentation and logbooks up to the month you file your renewal application.You can call the logbook program number at the appropriate office to verify your records.
If you're missing any reports or failed to submit logbook entries, take care of those deficiencies before you file your renewal application.

, The appropriate regional office typically will mail you a renewal package within two months of the date your permit is set to expire. If you don't receive a renewal package, you are responsible for getting the forms yourself from the regional office.Keep track of your permit expiration dates and contact the regional office if a permit is set to expire within a month and you've not yet received a renewal package.
Keep in mind that renewal packages are sent to the mailing address on your permit application. You need to keep this address up to date and can file an address change form if necessary. However, if that address is no longer valid, you may have to pick up a renewal application in person from the regional office.

, The renewal application must be completed in full, even though it typically asks for information that may be exactly the same as the information on your original application.The information you enter on your renewal application must be accurate as of the date on the renewal application.
In addition to the application with your complete signature, you must include a check or money order for the appropriate amount of fees and your vessel's U.S. Coast Guard Certificate of Documentation or state registration.
If the required fees aren't listed on your application, you can find out how much you must pay by contacting the appropriate regional office.

, While some types of permits can be renewed after they've expired, getting your permit renewed before the expiration date ensures you can continue your commercial fishing business without interruption.You may mail your renewal application or use overnight delivery services. You also can take it in personally. However, keep in mind that applications are processed in the order in which they are received, so getting it there more quickly doesn't necessarily guarantee that it will be processed immediately.
Keep in mind that even if you send in your renewal application before the date your old permit is set to expire, it may not be processed by that expiration date.
If your permit expires, you are not allowed to engage in commercial fishing until a renewal or new permit has been issued.
Letting your permit expire can result in a longer processing time for your application.

Decide when to purchase the minnows.,
Get a container to put the minnow in.,
Prepare the container for the minnow.,
Add some of your water to the water the minnows are held in.,
Put the closed plastic bag containing the minnows into your bait bucket.,
Add the minnows to your holding container.,
Don't overcrowd your minnow tank.,
Store the container in a dark, cool spot.,
Put an aerator in the container.,
Pour a small amount of hydrogen peroxide into the cooler if you do not have an aerator.,
Keep the water cool.,
Immerse the bait bucket into the lake or creek where you are fishing.,
Attach the minnow to the hook.,
Be prepared to replace minnows.",How to Keep Minnows Alive," Minnows do not usually live that long, especially when they are kept in less than optimal conditions. This means that you should purchase them close to the time you plan on going fishing.


This can be a problem, however, if you plan on going fishing in the early morning, as many bait shops are not open early enough to accommodate buying minnows on the day you want to go fishing.A bait fish that is kept in poor conditions, such as being overcrowded, can die in less than 24 hours. In order to have your fish last longer, you need to care for them properly.The lifespan of a minnow varies greatly depending on the type of minnow and the conditions it is living in. Fathead minnows and bluntnose minnows, for example, can live several years in a natural environment, such as a pond.There are some minnows that can live as long as seven to ten years.When using minnows for fishing, however, the conditions are less than ideal. This means they are likely to die much, much quicker.;
, Many people keep minnows in a foam camping cooler or some other disposable, insulated container. However, there are containers that you can buy that are made specifically to keep minnow in.Foam coolers should be available at most grocery stores. Containers made specifically to keep minnow in are usually available at sporting goods stores or specialty fishing stores.
Specialty containers can come with a variety of special features, such as the ability to float the container in a body of water and aerator attachments.

, Fill your container with distilled water or water from a lake or creek right before you buy the minnows or quickly after you do. The water should be cold, as the fish need a cool temperature to stay alive.The chemicals in tap water can kill your minnows, so don't use it to keep the minnows in.
The container you are using should maintain a constant temperature, helping keep your minnows alive longer.

, Gently pour some of the lake, creek, or distilled water you are using into the plastic bag the minnows came in. This will give them the ability to adjust to the water, and its temperature, gradually., You do not want to simply dump them into your container immediately. Instead, allow enough time for the minnows to adjust to the temperature of the water in your bait bucket.Keep the bag shut and place it into the cooler of water for about 15 minutes.

, After 15 minutes, allow the minnows to leave the bag and swim freely in the foam cooler or bait bucket. The period of acclimation they went through should allow them to quickly adapt to their new surroundings., Crowding too much bait into a container can cause the bait to die more quickly. Too many fish will deplete oxygen quickly and create too much heat.For example, only put about six dozen small minnows (3/4' to 1"" long) in an eight quart container.

, For example, you can store your bait container in a closet or a basement. Minnows are delicate and thrive better in cooler water. The water will warm up too quickly if you keep the cooler in a bright area.

, An aerator will add oxygen to the water, so that the minnows don't use it up and suffocate. This is especially important if you need to keep the fish for a day or two, and if you don't plan on switching out the bait container water often.


Those that sell minnows commercially usually use an aeration system that oxygenates their water in one of two ways: agitation or compressed oxygen.An aerator can help to increase the lifespan of your minnow. This is due to the fact that other ways of aerating the water, such as adding additional water or adding hydrogen peroxide, can stress the fish immensely. With an aerator, the minnows get to simply stay in the water that you have already acclimated them to.

, You only want to add one ounce of three percent hydrogen peroxide solution for every three gallons of water. The hydrogen peroxide assists in the formation of oxygen in the water, replacing oxygen that is used up by the fish.You can also add more distilled water as necessary to refresh the minnows' water.
Adding hydrogen peroxide to water is a controversial idea. Some people believe that it helps to oxygenate the water and won't hurt fish but others argue that it could kill fish easily.If you are unsure or apprehensive about adding it to your minnow's water, find an alternative, such as an aerator or changing water frequently.

, Place ice cubes in a jar in the water that's inside the bait bucket to keep it sufficiently cool for the minnows. Repeat this as often as necessary to keep the water cool.


Although minnows can survive in warm water, the rate of death increases dramatically once holding water is above 60 degrees fahrenheit.Try to keep your water below this temperature.
Don't add ice directly to the water the minnows are in. The ice may contain small amounts of chemicals or chlorine that will kill the fish.

, You can either do this by placing the container on the edge of the water, where it sits in the water but doesn't exchange water, or you can use a container that allows the water from the body of water to flow in and out of the container without losing fish. This will help the bait acclimate to the temperature of the body of water you are fishing in.Placing your bait bucket into the lake or creek, so that the water is replaced, oxygenates the water, which also helps keep the minnows alive.

, Pick a minnow to place on your hook and decide how you will attach it. There are several schools of thought about what way is best to connect the minnow. Make your decision based on what is the best combination of keeping the bait alive and how the attachment allows the bait to move in the water.Through the mouth: Push the hook through the fishes' bottom lip up through the nostrils.
Through the back: Hooking a minnow through the back allows the minnow to be in a more natural position in the water. This may be more effective for catching fish.

, Once you have put a minnow on a line, no matter what way you have done it, it will die relatively quickly. If it stops moving in the water, it is a much less effective bait than when it was alive. Because of this, it's best to replace minnows on your hook after they die.The rate at which minnows die varied dramatically depending on their health when you put them on the hook and the conditions in the water. Just be aware when you are recasting whether the minnow seems to be alive still or not.

Attend a kids' fishing event with your child.,
Go to a sports show.,
Tour an aquarium or fish hatchery.,
Take the child fishing yourself.",How to Introduce a Kid to the Joy of Fishing1," Many state departments of natural resources or conservation put on kids' fishing events to teach both children and their parents about fishing. These events are held at various locations around the state, feature trained instructors, and usually provide equipment for children to use during their outing. Some events are held in conjunction with free fishing days or weekends, when the state suspends its requirement that fishermen purchase licenses in order to fish. You can find out specific times and places of these events by visiting the website of your state department of conservation or natural resources; some may sponsor special websites devoted to fishing.


Kids' fishing events may also be sponsored by private outdoor organizations, youth groups, city police departments, or other organizations. In some cases, the purpose is more than simply introducing children to the joy of fishing, such as building goodwill in the community, but these events feature many of the same activities as fishing events sponsored by state conservation departments.;
, Many outdoor exhibition shows include either tanks that show fish in miniature representations of their aquatic environments or stocked artificial ponds at which the attendees can fish for a small fee in addition to the show's admission fee. These events provide each angler with his or her own rod, usually of the same type and usually all having the same bait or lure.

, Some state conservation departments maintain exhibit aquariums of some of their game fish species or offer tours of their hatcheries to show anglers and their families how those fish are raised. Although there are no actual fishing opportunities associated with these tours, they can provide opportunities for learning about fish habits and habitats � and the excitement of seeing fish boil the surface to compete for morsels of food thrown to them.

, If you regularly go fishing and have a child eager to tag along with you, this is an excellent opportunity to introduce that child to the joy of fishing. You'll want to take the child's age, ability, interests, and attention span into account in choosing an appropriate place to go fishing and the amount of time to spend. Generally, early trips should be fairly short and gradually get longer as the child's interest and abilities expand. You can also expect to handle such chores as baiting the hook and taking the fish off it when the child is particularly young.


Go fishing for species that will provide your child with sufficient excitement without being unduly challenging. Species such as bluegill, black or white crappie, sunfish, perch, and bullhead catfish will all provide a young child with an entertaining experience when they take the bait and the hook is set.
You may want to take your child to either a public or private lake that is regularly restocked with fish. Fishing at these lakes usually costs a daily-use fee in addition to the cost of your fishing license and any park fees, but the increased opportunity to catch that first fish may be worth the added cost.

"
"
Choose a suitable rod.,
Choose a suitable reel.,
Equip your child with sufficient tackle.",How to Introduce a Kid to the Joy of Fishing2," Freshwater fishing rods for adults typically run from 5 to 7 1/2 feet (1.5 to 2.45 m) in length. For a young child, however, a rod of 3 to 5 feet (0.9 to 1.5 m), or roughly the length that the child is tall, is a better choice. The rod should have the same type of metal line guides found on an adult rod, not wire loop or plastic guides, which can bend or break easily, and there should be enough guides so that the line follows the arc of the rod when it bends.


Be sure the rod matches the type of reel your child will use. Spincasting reels rest on top of the rod, whose reel seat is recessed and features a trigger-like rest for the index finger of the casting hand. Open- and closed-faced spinning reels rest below the rod, which features a straight seat with a retaining clamp; the guide nearest the seat is also larger than that for a spincasting rod.
Some anglers choose to start their children out with cane poles, which are usually equipped with only a short length of line. These may be suitable for very small children but may be frustrating for children who see that rods and reels can cast much longer distances.

, Although you may be proficient with either a baitcasting or fly reel, the best type of fishing reel for children and most other first-time anglers to learn to use is the spincasting reel. A spincasting reel is a fixed-spool reel covered by a housing. One or more pickup pins spool the line on the reel when retrieving, and the line is released whenever you push the thumb button on the back of the reel. A spincasting reel goes on top of the rod and is cast roughly the same way as a baitcasting reel, making it easier to transition to the more complex reel when your child is older.


If you primarily fish with spinning tackle, however, consider starting your child with a closed-face spinning reel. These reels rest below the rod as do open-faced spinning reels, but they release the line with a lever trigger above the reel instead of cocking back the bail as on an open-faced reel. Closed-face spinning reels are less common than either open-faced spinning reels or spincasting reels, but they are made by most major fishing reel manufacturers.
For a first-time fisherman, the reel should be equipped with 8 to 10 pound test (4 to 5 kg class) monofilament fishing line.

, Initially, you may want to let your child share your tackle box, although some anglers prefer to provide their children with their own tackle box before their first outing. A child's tackle box may include any or all of the following equipment, which may be purchased beforehand or as the child develops the skill to use it:


Hooks, in sizes 4 and 6. Include single hooks for fishing with worms or minnows and treble hooks for fishing with marshmallows.
A package of split-shot sinkers. (One form of package is a plastic ""wheel,"" with a cover that rotates to provide access to sinkers of different sizes. Look for split shot with little nibs at one end to allow for easy removal from the line with pliers when changing sinkers.)
A package of bell or Dipsey sinkers, in weights from 1/4 to 1/2 ounce (14.15 to 28.35 g).
2 to 3 small bobbers.
Stringer for keeping caught fish.
Needle-nose pliers, for removing hooks from the fish's mouth. (Some anglers keep 2 pairs, 1 to remove hooks and the other for holding onto the mouths of toothed fish such as pike or walleye or barbed fish such as catfish.)
Fingernail clippers, for clipping the end of the line.
Rag, for cleaning hands and for gripping fish with when removing hooks.
You may also want to include small artificial lures, such as jigs or grubs, with or without spinners.

Reel your fish in.",How to Ice Fish," Before you can go fishing you need to get a fishing license. Each state has its own set of requirements, but it is generally pretty easy to get one. Plus, the money for your license goes toward natural resource conservation and education.Some people prefer to take a fishing course before trying out ice fishing. Some of them are even free.Make sure you know your state’s regulations before any type of fishing to avoid a fine. Certain fish species are off limits, size limited, or catch-and-release only.;
, It is not a good idea to ice fish alone, for your safety. If you fall into the ice and there is nobody else there to pull you out or call for help, you are in a lot of danger. This is especially important if you are fishing somewhere remote. Ask a friend to go with you, or go with a group., Most state-owned lakes allow ice fishing. You may want to check before heading out to any county-owned bodies of water, as those are often ice fishing prohibited. Lakes, ponds, or any other large body of water should have enough fish under the ice.Popular species for ice fishing are Walleye, Trout, Crappie, Yellow Perch, Largemouth Bass, Pike, and Sunfish. Check around to see if anyone knows where these fish are swimming around. If you don’t know anyone, ask the local bait and tackle shop.Online forums are a great resource for finding good ice fishing locations.Once you have a location in mind, tell someone where you are going and when you expect to return. That way, if they do not hear from you when you expect to be back they can call for help., As ice fishing generally takes place in the winter, weather conditions can be variable or unpredictable. This is important if you are not used to cold temperatures, or spending long periods of time on ice.Make sure you know what time the sun goes down. Walking across the ice can be dangerous at night and it is easier to get caught in the dark during short winter days., As with any outdoor activity, make sure you know proper safety procedures. Bring a first-aid kit that includes hypothermia supplies, flotation devices, and rope. More importantly, know how to use everything in your kit.There are other things to consider beyond knowing how to use your first-aid kit. You should not fish alone. Be careful where you step on the ice, make sure the ice has a blue tint, is not cracked, and is very thick. The people in your party should spread out as you walk across the ice, rather than all walking together in the same spot. If you are going to be somewhere remote, you might consider investing in a GPS device.If you want to verse yourself in safety beyond the basics consider taking an outdoor safety course.

, The most effective way to shield yourself from the elements while you are out there will be to layer. You will want to bring a backpack or duffel to carry any layers you put on or take off. With the right layering, you should be able to stay warm throughout the day.Your first layer will be a thin moisture-wicking layer. Make sure your bottom layer is not made from cotton. Polypropylene, high-tech polyester, or wool materials work best. This is true for your shirt, pants, socks, and glove liners.Your second layer should be a thicker layer. A wool sweater or fleece would both work fine.Your top layer will be a waterproof or down jacket. It will protect you from the cold temperatures and any possible rain.Make sure your boots are warm and waterproof. If you plan on doing a lot of walking to get to your fishing spot, break your boots in before your trip.Bring a warm hat to wear (like a knit beanie), and gloves or mittens. You want to make sure your extremities are warm.A lot of people will bring a pair of goggles to protect their eyes in case there is a snow blizzard.Metal spikes that wrap onto the bottom of your shoes can make your trip along the ice a safer one. They help grip the ice better than just walking with the soles of the boots alone., Wearing weather appropriate clothing is just one category of gear you need for ice fishing. Depending on conditions, you may need more gear for your safety and comfort throughout the day. You need gear to drill your hole, ensure your comfort, and catch your fish.Many ice fishers bring an ice spud with them to check the ice as they walk along it. They use the rod to tap the ice in front of them, listening to make sure it is safe to take another step.Ice shanties can provide a lot of comfort while you are sitting out there for many hours. They are small shelters you can set up near your ice hole that help protect you from the wind. It is also nice to have a chair to sit on so you do not have to stand all day.Some ice fishers bring hand warmers just in case the temperatures dip. You can find hand warmers at most outdoor gear shops.You will need an auger (or ice chisel) to drill your ice hole once you find a good spot. This tool drills through the ice into the water below.An ice scoop is handy for removing excess ice from your hole once you have drilled through it. This is how you get a clean ice hole to fish in.You will need a rod and reel to catch your fish. Some rods and reels are better for ice fishing. Check your local outdoor store and ask someone if they have any special sets for ice fishing. If not, any rod and reel will work.Bring bait, tackle, and a tackle box. You will need this gear to lure your fish. If you are not sure how to use bait and tackle, most tackle shops will explain it to you., The bait and tackle you use will depend on which species you are trying to catch. Some fish species respond better to live bait, and some respond better to fake bait. Decide ahead of time which species you want to catch so you know what bait and tackle to bring with you.Most fish aren’t as aggressive in the winter, so use lighter tackle for ice fishing.Common tackle ice fishing are jigging rods, hooks, ice flies, jigs, and tip-ups.Common live bait in ice fishing are minnows, leeches, and night crawlers.If you aren’t sure what to use, ask someone at a local tackle shop.

, Since you will be ice fishing most of the day, bring enough food and water to keep you satiated and hydrated. It will behoove you to bring hot drinks as well, to help keep you warm. Bring extra since you burn more calories in cold temperatures.Bring a bucket in case you catch something! You can bring a bucket for yourself, or one big enough to share with your fishing party. A lot of people will carry their food out in the bucket and then carry the fish back in it., Every ice fisher has their own way of choosing where they want their spot.Many ice fishers will scout the lake in the fall to see where the fish are hanging out so they know where to go in the winter.Others will go back to their favorite fishing spots from before., The most important part of setting up your ice hole is making sure the ice is thick enough to hold your weight. Since you will be sitting there all day it is necessary that you make sure you will not fall through the ice.Four inches of ice thickness will support one ice fisher and their gear. Of course, you do not want to go fishing by yourself, so you should make sure your ice is at least five or six inches thick. You can measure the ice after cutting it, or check the ice fishing reports from your wildlife district office., Once you have selected your ice fishing spot you will need to drill your fishing hole. Using your auger, place it perpendicular to the ice so that the tip is touching the surface. Push the auger down onto the ice and turn it clockwise until the blade begins to cut into the surface. Keep turning until the chunk of ice releases and you see the water below.If you mess up your hole, just start over in another spot nearby. It is very common for an ice fisher to drill several holes in a day. You can spend a day practicing using your auger until you are comfortable using it., Use your ice scoop to remove any excess ice that remains. Place the scoop into your hole below the level of the ice so that it is in the water. Lift it back up, bringing with it any snow or ice that may have fallen into the hole when you drilled it. You can do this throughout the day if any ice or snow gets into the hole., If it is snowing hard, or you think you will leave your hole at any point in the day you can cover it with your bucket or a catch cover. This will prevent more snow or ice from getting in while you are away., First, you need to know how deep the water is, so you know how far to sink your line. You can do this by putting a sinker at the end of a hook and dropping it into the water. Let the reel unreel until the sinker reaches the bottom. Bring it back up a few feet from the bottom and place a bobber where the surface of the water is., Depending on what species you want to catch, select bait from your collection and place it at the end of your lure. Once your bait is on the lure you can put the line back into the hole., Now is your time to wait. If you are using a tip-up, you will place that over the hole so that it is resting on the edges. Otherwise, you can prop your rod up somewhere so that it is in a sturdy location should a fish bite your line.This is a good time to play games with your fishing pals, converse, or just enjoy yourself in the great outdoors.
If you do not get any bites on your line after a few hours, drill another hole. You can drill another hole in the location you are in, but you will fare better to move to another location at least few hundred feet over and drill a hole there.
If that does not work, try using live bait if you are not already.

, When the fish bites, reel your line in or lift your line out of the hole, lifting the fish along with it. Unhook the fish from the line. You can drop the fish into your bucket to clean later. Keep fishing!"
"
Put some attractor beads on your line.,
Attach a short monofilament leader.,
Add some weight to the line.,
Choose the right hook.,
Hook the sand flea lightly through the body.,
Go out to the beach at low tide.,
Look for V-shaped areas on the sand near tiny shells and rocks.,
Gather up a bunch of sand fleas.,
Keep the sand fleas in a bucket of moist sand.,
Drain out the fleas’ waste daily.,
Consider freezing sand fleas for later use.",How to Hook a Sand Flea," Sand flea eggs are orange in color; many fishermen believe these eggs are what attract fish to eat sand fleas. They therefore like to thread orange plastic beads on their line before attaching the hook.


Small fluorescent orange bobbers can serve the same purpose as the beads, with the added benefit of keeping the bait just off the bottom.;
, If you like to fish with light line (10 to 15 pound test/5 to 7 kg class), use a heavier monofilament leader (25 pound test/12 kg class) of about 18 inches (45 cm). You can attach a snap swivel to the line to make it easier to change hooks/lures.


You may also want to use a small split shot for added casting weight.

, Some fishermen use only a small split shot for added casting weight, while others use sinkers of up to 4 ounces (114 g), depending on where they’re fishing and what species they’re after.

, There are two styles of hook commonly used for hooking sand fleas:


Pompano fishermen favor the Kahle hook, which features a wide, round bend that aims the hook point back toward the middle of the hook shaft. Other circular style hooks can work equally well.Sheepshead fishermen prefer to use a long-shafted hook, typically about size 1.

, Thread the point up through the body above the telson (spade-like tail section) and belly sac toward the head, making sure the crustacean can disperse its eggs as you retrieve it.Ideally, the hook will be run through at enough of an angle so the crustacean will be pulled to the side when you retrieve the bait.


Some fishermen prefer to push the barb through the shell, while other fishermen prefer to poke only the hook point through the shell.Lightly hooking the sand flea this way makes it less likely to hang up on seaweed or rocks.
Some fishermen prefer to remove the sand flea’s hard outer shell altogether., This exposes the areas sand fleas inhabit.

, The V-marks are places where sand fleas have dug themselves in.You may also be able to see a few sand fleas in the process of burying themselves.

, The easiest way to do this is with your hands, a sand shovel, or a sand rake, but some fishermen instead put out a thin net where the sand fleas are, kick the sand to loosen it, then let the tide sweep the dislodged sand fleas into the net., Sand fleas need enough moisture to keep their gills wet, which is why you use moist sand. You do not want to submerge them in water, however, as they will drown.


If the weather is especially hot, cover the moist sand with a damp cloth. You may also want to cover the cloth with ice chips to keep the cloth and sand beneath cool.

, Sand fleas will keep 3 to 4 days in a bucket of moist sand, but during that time, they do produce a yellow-colored waste that must be removed to keep them from suffocating., If you can’t readily find sand fleas, or you find more than you can use during a single outing, you may want to freeze and store sand fleas for future use. To do this, first boil the fleas and then freeze them. Frozen sand fleas will keep 3 to 4 months.

Decide who's eligible to take part in the tournament.,
Determine which species of fish you're fishing for.,
Decide where you want to hold the tournament.,
Choose a date or dates for the tournament.,
Familiarize yourself with the fishing and boating regulations of the jurisdiction where you plan to hold the tournament.,
Establish the tournament rules.,
Set the entry fee.,
Promote the event.",How to Host a Fishing Tournament," This often depends on the organization putting on the event.


For a fishing tournament put on by a fishing club or professional fishing organization, entries are generally limited to members in good standing of the organization. Some organizations may allow prospective members to join the organization and enter their first tournament at the same time.
For a youth fishing tournament, entries are limited to children of a certain age, although younger children may be partnered with or assisted by an adult or older sibling.;
, Fishing tournaments can be held to fish for a single species of fish, a related group of species, or any legal game fish that can be caught at the site of the tournament.


Fishing tournaments organized by professional fishing associations typically restrict themselves to a single species or fish family. For instance, competitors in tournaments run by B.A.S.S. fish for largemouth and (sometimes) smallmouth bass. Competitors in tournaments run by the Walleye Federation (TWF) fish for walleye.
Fishing tournaments run by amateur fishing associations not associated with a particular fish species have a freer selection of species to fish for. In some cases, the best species to fish for can be determined by which species are most in need of being fished to maintain a proper predator/prey balance in the waters where the tournament will be held. In other cases, the maturity of the angler should play the dominant role; a tournament for pre-teen or special needs children should probably be for any legal fish in the waters being fished.

, Fishing tournaments can be held at lakes, reservoirs, streams, or in the ocean. Where you hold the tournament depends on several factors:


Availability of the fish species you're fishing for. Generally, the lakes where B.A.S.S. and TWF hold their tournaments are noted among anglers for their populations of bass and walleye.
Accessibility to the anglers who'll be competing. While many remote lakes in Canada are noted for their populations of walleye, a reservoir such as Lake Oahe in South Dakota is more accessible to the majority of walleye anglers and thus a better tournament site.
Venue size. Generally, lakes and artificial reservoirs that host fishing tournaments are medium-to larger-sized lakes to accommodate the number of anglers who may take part.
Association with the organizing group. In most cases, organizations with a state or other jurisdiction in their group's name will want to hold their fishing tournaments within that jurisdiction's borders, assuming the above criteria are met. The Nebraska Walleye Association holds its tournaments at sites within Nebraska that are known for walleye; such as Merritt Reservoir, Lewis and Clark Lake, and Lake McConaughy; however, the Nebraska B.A.S.S. Federation holds most of its tournaments outside Nebraska, as Nebraska has few bass hotspots large enough to host a tournament.

, Most fishing tournaments are held on weekends and may include both Saturday and Sunday. The best weekends are those where the body of water under consideration is not under peak use from non-tournament anglers and other outdoor enthusiasts.


Consider whether the species you plan to fish for in the tournament is spawning during that period. Some jurisdictions prohibit fishing for spawning fish in certain waters, and some organizations consider it unethical to fish for spawning fish.

, Regardless of what other rules you plan to have for your tournament, you must conform to the bag and possession limits and any other regulations for the state or other jurisdiction where the fishing tournament is held, as well as to the legal methods for catching fish. You can find this information on the jurisdiction's fish and wildlife department's website. (The actual name of the department may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction; it may be known as the Department of Natural Resources or the Game and Parks Commission, for example.)


Bag limits refer to the number of fish that may be caught per day. In many cases, tournaments restrict the number of fish caught per day on a multi-day tournament to fewer fish than the jurisdiction's limit.
Possession limits refer to how many fish an angler may have in his or her possession at any given time, whether on a stringer, in a cooler on site, or in a freezer at home. For tournaments where live fish are returned to the water after being weighed, possession limits are not a concern, but if the anglers competing are allowed to keep any or all of their catch, it may be.
Some species have minimum or maximum lengths or weights imposed by the state in order to ensure a suitable population for all anglers. In some cases, more stringent length and weight limits are imposed on a given lake or stream or during spawning season to ensure a sustainable fishery.
Boating regulations typically include such requirements as life jackets for each occupant of the boat, running lights for night use, and a kill switch for outboard motors of a certain horsepower or greater. Some jurisdictions in densely populated areas where the lake a tournament is to be held is used as a source of drinking water may require boats on that lake to be steam-cleaned and bear a sticker attesting to this.

, Rules for a fishing tournament may encompass any or all of the following:


Scoring. Tournaments generally determine a winner by total weight of fish caught during the tournament. In the event of ties, they may use the weight of the biggest fish caught as a tie-breaker.
What tackle may be used. Tackle is usually restricted to rods and reels and may be restricted by the type of rod and reel (as in fly-fishing tournaments) or even rod length. Participants may also be restricted as to how many rods they can have in use at a given time.
What fishing methods may be used. Depending on the tournament, this may mean disallowing trolling, snagging fish, or the use of live bait.
Whether participants fish alone or with a partner. Fishing tournaments where the participants fish from shore tend to allow their participants to fish alone, while tournaments where the participants fish from boats often pair anglers so that each can witness the other's actions.
Areas off-limits to fishing. Some tournaments have rules as to how close competitors may be to each other when fishing as well as a minimum distance from the host marina.
Participation/use of fishing guides. Some tournaments may allow guides to compete in tournaments on lakes and streams where they normally guide, provided they are not hired by any of the other participants during the tournament and for a period of time before it.
Allowing practice fishing prior to the tournament so participants may scout the lake for hot spots. Most tournaments allow this, although they may disallow it for a brief period before the event. (In its early years, the Bassmasters Classic kept the tournament site secret until just prior to the tournament, thus effectively prohibiting practice fishing.)
Handling/preservation of the fish. Many freshwater fishing tournaments require competitors to keep their fish alive until weighing, often with an in-boat live well or similar method, and many include either rewards or penalties related to the fish's condition at weigh-in. Live fish are usually returned to the water after weighing; dead fish may be donated to a charity such as a homeless shelter for feeding its residents.
Conduct of participants. This includes a stated expectation of good sportsmanship and may also include rules against seeding a spot with baitfish prior to the tournament, barring access to hot spots, and prohibition of alcohol or other drugs.
Legal issues and disputes. Tournaments may require competitors who use their own boats to have and carry proof of liability insurance for themselves and their passengers. They may also stipulate a time limit for submitting and a method for resolving disputes that arise.

, The entry fee should be based on the number of participants you expect to attract and allow you to recoup your administrative and promotional costs. You'll likely pay a fee to the hosting marina and possibly to a governmental agency; you may also want to have a post-tournament dinner.


You can defer some of the costs by seeking sponsors for the tournament, such as businesses local to the tournament site, major sporting goods stores, and fishing tackle manufacturers.

, To make your fishing tournament a success, you'll need to promote it effectively. Your marketing plan can include any or all of the following:


Cooperative advertising with the host marina, tournament sponsors, and charities benefiting from the event.
Contacting outdoor writers for local newspapers and fishing magazines and submitting press releases for those publications.
Social media such as Facebook and Twitter before the event and Pinterest to post photos after the event to build interest in subsequent events.
Posters and flyers in sporting goods stores and local businesses and at related events.

Use care not to damage the spine with larger fish.,
Urge the fish into the net, do not net it from the tail end.

,
After netting a fish, do not lift it out of the water unless you have a net that can support the entire body lengthwise.,
Use this same technique when fishing to keep your catch still while you are removing the hook.,
Use this technique for fish up to five pounds.

",How to Handle  Fish With Care," The spine is smaller and weaker close to the tail. Keep the body of your pet fish straight as possible after netting it.;
,, To keep the fish from thrashing too much, lift the it with the net and place your hand under the fish's belly. The fish will be completely still.

, Some fish are very active or have sharp spines that can impale you and cradling the fish will be a great help for both the ""catch and release"" and ""food on the table"" fisherman.

Stop seining when the catfish seine is full.

,
Zip a live car into the catfish seine.,
Pull the seine and live car to shore.,
Detach the live car from the seine.,

Separate the larger catfish from the smaller fish.,
Transport the harvested catfish to the processing plant.",How to Harvest Catfish," Although not done for all ponds, many fish farmers drain their ponds by 20 to 30 percent to get the catfish into a smaller area and make harvesting easier. Those catfish farmers who plan to harvest catfish of only a certain minimum size generally do not drain down the level of their ponds.;
, Seines are large nets used to scoop the catfish out of the ponds they were raised in. A standard seine to harvest catfish runs a length of 1,000 to 1,400 feet (300 to 420 meters) and has a depth of either 6, 9, or 12 feet (1.8, 2.7, or 3.6 m). The seine mesh size ranges from 3/4 to 2 inches (1.8 to 5 cm), which allows catfish weighing less than 1 to 2 pounds (2.2 to 4.4 kg) to slip through so they can grow to a harvestable size.


The seines are framed with half-inch (1.25-cm) rope at the top and bottom. The top rope is laced with floats at least 3 inches (7.5 cm) square spaced at every third tie. The bottom rope features 2-ounce (5.7 g) weights spaced at every second tie.
The mesh ropes are covered with plastic- or petroleum-based materials to prevent the spine in the catfish's dorsal fin from getting caught in the net.

, The catfish seine is wound onto a large hydraulic reel. The truck- or tractor-driven reel can reel the seine in or let it out as necessary when harvesting the catfish.


In smaller ponds, the seine can be pulled by hand, and so a seine reel is not needed.

, Starting at the deep end keeps the larger catfish from escaping into deep water as the seine is trawled through the pond. If the shallow end is deep enough to accommodate the seine, however, it can be drawn through the pond from the shallows to the deep end.


In larger ponds, the seine is drawn off the seine reel using another truck or tractor on the opposite side of the catfish pond from the tractor holding the seine reel. A boat with a push rack comes in behind the seine to keep it from bogging down in mud at the bottom of the pond.

, This will gather the larger catfish into the net while letting undersized fish slip through. The harvesting area is created when the 2 tractors reach the opposite end of the pond and start converging to close the net around the catfish, which may number from 50,000 to 100,000, depending on the pond's size and catfish population, and how large the mesh is.


In some ponds, a basin-like area is dug out specifically for harvesting the catfish.

,, The live car, or harvest sock, is a collecting mesh into which the catfish are shunted through a funnel in the seine. It measures 8 to 10 feet (2.4 to 3 m) wide by 50 to 100 feet (15 to 30 m) long and is designed to hold 50,000 to 100,000 pounds (22.7 to 45.4 tonnes) of fish at a density of 20 pounds per cubic foot (320.4 kg per cubic meter). As with the seine, the live car has floats along the top to keep it above the water and to keep fish from escaping into the water.


As with the seine, the live car's mesh size is designed to separate out larger from smaller fish. The mesh size used varies according to the minimum size of fish required by the processing plant to which the harvested catfish will be shipped.

, As the seine is pulled slowly and evenly on either side, the harvested catfish are drawn into the live car. Workers keep the top of the seine from going underwater, which would let fish escape.

, If the weather is hot or if the water has been muddied from the seining, the live car can be pulled into clear water and staked in place. An aerator is connected to the live car to keep the fish alive until they can be loaded onto a truck.

, Some catfish farmers repeat the seining process until about 80 percent of the fish have been seined. They then drain the pond and continue seining until all the fish are removed. Catfish farmers who harvest only catfish of a certain minimum size do not repeatedly drain and seine.

, Known as grading, this process segregates the larger, more profitable fish from the smaller, less profitable fish. Fish are herded into loading baskets with a dip net or another piece of mesh designed to separate fish by size.

, Catfish are transported in trucks equipped with live wells, where they are killed and skinned. Some are filleted, and some of the fillets are cut into nugget-sized pieces.

Set the hook in the trout by quickly jerking the rod tip up. Reel in slowly and keep the rod tip above your head.Scoop the fish up with your net once you’ve brought the fish to the shore.
Keep the trout that you want to eat. Release the other fish back into the river.

, Use the net to get the fish into the bucket.


Handle the fish as little as possible until you’re ready to gut it.
Add additional fish to the same bucket. Make sure that the trout all have room to swim.

, Cut off the trout’s head when you’re ready to gut the fish.Lay the trout flat on a cutting board or other flat surface. Hold the fish down on the cutting board with your left hand.
Get a sharp knife that can easily slice through the fish. Start slicing right behind the gills.Cut the head off in one swift motion with a sharp knife.
Throw the head away when you’re done.
Don’t hurt the trout any more than you need to. Torturing animals is needlessly cruel.

Don’t hurt the trout any more than you need to. Torturing animals is needlessly cruel.

, Continue to use the same cutting board.


Hold the tail with one hand. And start scraping the scales off with the backside of a knife. Start at the tail and end at the head. Keep scaling until most of the scales are gone. Rinse the scales off thoroughly in the sink.

, Try to cut in a straight line up along the underbelly.Lay the trout flat on a cutting board or other flat surface. Hold the fish down on the cutting board with your left hand.
Try to cut one clean line through the bottom of the fish. Don’t cut into the guts.

, Reach into the body cavity to remove the intestines, heart, and other organs. Scrape out the organs with a spoon or pull the organs out with your hand. Put your spoon or hand through the cut open fish.
Try not to let any organs break open as this can spread disease. Throw the organs away when you are done.

, Identify the spine as a blood red line that goes from head to tail on the uppermost part of the fish. Scrape out the spine with your thumb or a spoon. Scrape from the tail to the gills.
Take this opportunity to remove any guts that remain. Make sure to wash out all organs and blood. Scrape any organs out that you can’t wash away.

, Freeze the trout if you’re not going to cook it right away.Make sure all of the guts are gone before you freeze or cook the trout. Rinse the fish in clean water before cooking or freezing.
Check to make sure that waters where you fish are free of contaminants. Don’t eat the fish if you’re unsure.

Identify how far down the fish's throat the hook is.,
Wiggle the hook gently if the fish did not swallow it.,
Learn that if the fish has swallowed the hook, you will need pliers.,
Go into the fish's mouth and grab the sharp end of the hook with the pliers.,
Pull the hook outwards of the fish's mouth where the hook curves and try to get the hook out of the throat.,
Cut the line and pull the hook out, and set the fish free.",How to Get a Hook out of a Fish's Throat," Determine if you need pliers (preferably needle-nose) or just a steady hand.;
, Use caution in this method. Getting the barb of the hook stuck will make things a lot more difficult. Instead, ""snap"" the barb with a pair of pliers to allow smoother retrieval of the hook. Snapping the barb means to crush it down towards the main hook so it cannot get caught on the fish. if this does not work, do not leave the hook in and cut your line.

, Fish have a diaphragm in the back of their throat which opens briefly and closes immediately while eating.

, Make sure you have slack on the line, as the hook needs to move freely.

, This may be tricky and can take some time. You should end up with the hook out of the mouth, yet with fishing line almost weaved through the fishes throat.

, This way, you do not lose your hook, you just need to tie your line back with a Blood Knot.

See if you even need a fishing license.,
Decide whether you qualify for a free license.,
Print out your license application.,
Mail in your license application.",How to Get a Fishing License in Ohio2," Depending on who you are and where you are fishing, you might not even need a license.Decide whether you fit into one of the following categories:


Children under 16 don't need licenses.
If you are assisting a disabled fisherman who cannot cast their line or retrieve their line without assistance, you don't need a license. However, the person receiving assistance does need a license, and the two fishermen have to share a line.
Active duty military on leave or furlough don't need licenses to fish.
You also don't need a license to fish in a privately owned pond, a body of water which you or your parents own (as long as it doesn't border state owned land), or on a body of water where you reside if you derive your income from agricultural production.

, There are several categories of people who are eligible for a free license--but they still do need to get a license.These categories of people include:


Disabled veterans, former prisoners of war, residents of state or county institutions, or disabled individuals who need assistance casting and retrieving their lines.
People born before January 1st, 1938.

, While individuals born before January 1st, 1938 will obtain their free licenses exactly the same way a person would obtain a paid license ( by phone, mail, in person at any license outlet, or online at http://wildlife.ohiodnr.gov/), if you fall into one of the other categories, the procedure is a little different.


If you are eligible for a free license for any reason other than age, you'll need to submit a formal application.The application is available at http://wildlife.ohiodnr.gov/fishing/fishing-regulations/licenses. Simply expand the section at the bottom that says ""License Exemptions"" and click the links at the bottom of the expanded section.

Determine where the break occurred.,
Cut off the frayed ends of the break.,
Measure the diameter of each cut piece.,
Glue the male ferrule end to the end of the rod that includes the rod tip.,
Glue the female ferrule to the end of the rod that includes the rod handle.,
Cover the area where the ferrules meet the rod blank with epoxy.,
Lathe the splice to get it as close to the original diameter of the rod blank as you can.,
Wrap the ends of the ferrules, and the epoxy sleeve, to match the wrapping around the rod guides.",How to Fix a Broken Fishing Rod1," Where the rod broke determines what you'll do next.


If the rod broke near the tip, you'll either have to replace the tip top/tip ring or cut the broken tip and put a new, larger tip top on the rod. See ""Fixing a Broken Rod Tip"" for details.






If the rod broke somewhere else, you'll have to cut out the break and insert a ferrule.





;
, Trim the ends until each is neat and square.

, You'll need these diameters to find the right size of ferrule to buy.

, You can use an epoxy resin glue that sets as fast as 5 minutes, although some professional rod repairers prefer a 2-part epoxy that takes longer to cure to allow more time to position the ferrule correctly.


Don't separate the male and female ferrule until finished with this procedure.

, Allow the cement to dry thoroughly before continuing.


If the break occurred near a rod guide or the reel seat, the rod's action will be largely unaffected. If the break occurred elsewhere in the middle of the blank, the ferrule will dampen the action, particularly if it is a metal ferrule.

, You want to build up a ""sleeve"" that covers either side of the ferrules up to the point where you can no longer see any damage. Let the glue cure completely before continuing.

, This requires using a lathe specially designed for fishing rods; if you don't have such a lathe, you can use fine sandpaper instead. Whichever method you use, work slowly.


Do not bend the rod while doing this, as this will split the epoxy sleeve.

, Once the wrappings are in place, coat them with a thin epoxy resin or polymer.


If the rod broke near enough to a guide, you can move the guide over the splice before wrapping the ferrules.
You can also further disguise the break by adding decorative wrappings elsewhere on the rod.

Every state's requirements are different, and some wilderness areas have either more lax restrictions or even greater restrictions/prohibitions on fishing. Getting caught without a license or fishing in a body of water that doesn't allow fishing can land you in trouble with the law, so it's best to comply with your state's requirements and know the rules wherever you intend to fish.Search online to see what your state requires.
You can also find information online on where and how to acquire a fishing license.
Some locations may allow you to acquire a fishing license online, while others require you to visit a retail or licensing facility in person.;
, You'll need some specialized equipment in order to fly fish. If you're working within a budget or aren't sure yet that you'll want to stick with fly fishing, it's best to borrow gear or purchase low-cost equipment. The basics you will need at any price point include:


a fly rod (for most freshwater streams, lakes, and ponds, a six to eight foot rod is sufficient)a spool
flies
pliers
a hemostat (special clamps/forceps used to remove hooks from a trout's mouth)
a sharp pocket knife
a rod and reel case
a fly box to transport your gear
a landing net
a hat to block out the sun (anything with a brim will suffice)
sunglasses with polarized lenses (so you can see through the glare in the water)
waders
wading boots (for better grip on the slippery riverbed)
non-slip feet attachments (like sole spikes)
a fly fishing vest with pockets for your tools and flies

, There are many different types of flies, each one designed to mimic a different aquatic invertebrate. You can purchase pre-made flies at most fishing supply stores, or try making your own. Some of the most common types of flies are designed to look like the following aquatic invertebrates/insects:


mayfly hatch
Caddisfly hatch
stonefly hatch
terrestrial hatch (designed to look like and imitate a terrestrial insect)
midges
scuds
leeches
dragonfly/damselfly

, If you've been fly fishing for a while or simply like working with your hands, you may prefer to make your own fly. Be aware, however, that it can be very time consuming. You'll need various types of feathers and fur, good eyesight (or a lighted magnifying glass to see better), and skilled hands.








Pass the line just before the eye of the hook and wrap it around the shank of the hook to the mid point.
Place your fly materials on the shank of the hook and pinch them in place.
Wrap the line around the fly materials until they're firmly in place, then wrap back over the spot you just wrapped. This will help secure the hackles (or whatever materials you're using) in place.
If you add any additional materials, make sure they're approximately even/level with the materials already wrapped to your hook.
You can split hackles or other materials by separating them a tiny bit (just a half inch or so at the tips) and wrapping some of the line between them.
Apply some wax to the line just before the hook/fly.
Pinch and twist a tiny amount of dubbing fur to the wax. Keep twisting and wrapping it in one direction up and down the waxed portion of line until the fur is tightly around that section of line.
Wrap the waxed and fur-wrapped section of line around the hook shank towards the tail, then turn and wrap back over the shank.
Tie off the line, cut off any excess thread, and use a drop of liquid cement to secure the whole fly in place.

, Whether you're tying your own homemade fly or tying on a store-bought fly, it's important to know how to attach a fly to your line so that it will stay on. Don't tighten any knots until your fly is in position, and make sure you know how to properly secure a fly on your line before you cast into a river.








Always wet your knot with saliva or river water before tightening it. This allows you to slide the knot around on the line and get it into place.
Keep your knots tight once they're in position. Use a continuous and steady pull on the line, and check that your fly is secure before casting.
Trim any excess line off the end past the knot. Try to cut as close to the knot as possible without actually hitting the knot itself.

, Fishing is partly a game of chance, but where you choose to fish can make a big difference in the outcome of your expedition. It's best to choose a quiet, secluded place far from other people (including other fishers). You'll also have to read the water to find the best places to cast, as fish tend to gravitate towards certain underwater environments.Look for boulders and submerged trees/debris. Fish tend to use these underwater areas for shelter/protection, as well as for feeding.
Scan the water for any areas just downstream of rocks and trees. Fish commonly position themselves just past these refuge areas knowing that smaller fish and aquatic invertebrates will travel downstream.
In the early morning hours you might be able to find fish in unusually shallow water as they search for food. Stand on the bank and scan the shallows for signs of fish.
Try casting in undercut banks. If the water has worn out a channel under the bank of the river and created a hollowed-out space, it's a good bet that fish congregate there.
Look for pools where the stream/river widens to a gut. The head of the pool (where the pool first widens) is usually a good fishing spot, as well as the slower current just downstream of the head.
Avoid casting in the downstream end of a pool (called the tailout). That area tends to be more shallow and near rapids/riffles downstream, so most fish tend to avoid these areas.

, Almost as important as where you fish is when you fish. Fish tend to feed in the morning around sunrise, and again in the evening around sunset. However, if you're new to fishing, it may be easiest to learn how to fish in the midday sun.If you're just starting to learn how to fly fish, you may not know how to spot a fish on the bed or a river.
You'll be able to see a fish's shadows most clearly during midday due to the position of the sun and the reduction of glare on the water.
If you're just starting out, it may be best to practice spotting fish and casting during the midday sun. You can always stick around until fish become more active, or come back at a later time.

, Fish are incredibly sensitive to their environment. Any kind of noise can disturb fish, though other factors may also tip them off to your whereabouts.Fish can detect disturbances in the water. Some may even be able to detect disturbances along the shore.
Never stomp your feet or make a lot of noise on the banks.
Stay in the shade so you don't cast a shadow, or try crouching/squatting as you approach the water.
If you intend to wade into the water, move very, very slowly. Walking in too rapidly will create ripples and send the sound through the water column.

, If you're on a clear bank with no low-hanging trees, you should be able to use a two-stroke cast. This is a basic casting method, but it requires some clearance above and behind you. Make sure you have enough room before attempting this cast, as a low tree branch can easily snag your line and cost you your fly.








Lead out approximately three rod-lengths' worth of fishing line.
Hold the rod with your dominant hand.
Check the line for tangles. If there are any tangles present, you'll need to straighten them out before casting.
With your arm slightly extended, whip the tip of the rod up and back in a steady movement.
Don't whip the rod too far back; you'll want to stop when the tip of the rod is pointing up and just slightly behind you.
Watch as the line unfurls. The three rod-lengths' worth of line should be extended.
Immediately before the line completely straightens out above/behind you, flick the rod forward to send the line out onto the surface of the water.

, If there's not enough room above or behind you, you may want to try a roll cast. This is somewhat similar in action to the two-stroke cast, but it doesn't require as much room or as much loose line.








Hold the rod in your dominant hand slightly in front of you.
Check the line for tangles. Straighten out any tangles present before you attempt to cast.
Gently bring the rod back. The tip should be above your casting shoulder, and a small piece of line should be hanging behind you.
Move the rod forward. Start slow, then speed it up as your arm comes down.
Don't whip the rod too far ahead. Stop when the tip of the rod is still angled slightly upward.
The loop of line should unfurl and cast onto the surface of the water.

, Fish should see your fly as a real insect








There are two primary ways to imitate an actual insect: letting it drift without any movement on your part, or giving the line very slight, gentle twitches to imitate natural movement.
Move your rod to the right or left to change the angle at which the line lays on the water.
If you are upstream from a fish, keep the rod (and your rod arm) angled upstream. As the fly moves downstream with the current, slowly angle your rod and arm to face downstream at the same speed the fly is moving at to create a drag-free line.
If a fish is feeding near the surface, try to cast your fly so that it lands near the fish's head and floats towards it.

, Once you've gotten a bite (which you should be able to feel if the line is taut), you'll need to hook the fish. If you don't hook the fish, or if you don't hook it properly, it can easily get away off your line.








Keep the rod's tip low to the water. That way when a fish strikes, you can move the rod's tip in the direction of line curvature.
Keep the line as taut as possible. If you try to set the hook while there's excess slack in the line it will not move the hook whatsoever.
Set the hook securely in the fish's mouth. You'll do this by continuing to hold the rod with one hand and pulling down sharply on the line with the other hand.
Do not yank the rod tip upwards. Some fishers do this thinking it helps set the hook, but really it just complicates the process of reeling in your fish.
If the fish tries to bolt upstream, keep the rod tip close to the water and pointed in the direction of the line, not the fish.
Continue to strip away line until the fish tires itself out.
Palm the reel if you're pulling in a big fish. This simply means applying pressure with your palm to the reel to prevent the spool from running out., After you've hooked your fish, it will begin to fight. It may try to swim upstream or downstream, or it may just jerk the line around trying to get free. The key is to let the fish tire itself out (while moving your rod accordingly), then reel it in.








Do not lift your rod up. This could put too much pressure on the rod, causing it to break.
Try to keep the fish in the water as much as possible, especially if you plan on releasing it.
If you're working with a larger fish, it may be easier to ""beach"" the fish by leading it onto a bank where the water is shallowest.
Move the net into position and gently pull the line to guide the fish head-first over the net's rim.
Once the fish's body is past the rim of the net, flick the rim up (to ensure the fish doesn't jump out quickly) while simultaneously lifting the net out of the water. This should prevent escape and send the fish to the bottom of your net.
Carefully unhook your fly from the fish's mouth. Remember that it will most likely be thrashing and flailing, so be careful not to cut yourself or hurt the fish.

, Once you've netted your fish, you'll need to decide whether your fish is big enough to keep. If it's too small, you'll need to release it. Before you do anything, though, you should know the restrictions and requirements in the region where you're fishing.


Different regions have differing requirements on the minimum size of a fish. Those requirements may change within a single state if you're fishing in a wilderness area.
Some bodies of water (especially those in wilderness areas) may be catch-and-release only. In this case, you must unhook the fish and set it loose in the water.
Always check the laws and guidelines in any region you intend to fish. You can find these requirements by searching online, or by asking a park ranger (or the equivalent).

Inspect the rod to see exactly what's been broken.,
Remove the old tip top.,
Measure the tip of the rod for a new tip top.,
Glue the new tip top on.",How to Fix a Broken Fishing Rod2," If the damage is to the tip top alone (broken or grooved guide ring), you can simply replace the tip top with a new one. If the damage is to the rod blank at the tip, you'll have to cut the rod tip cleanly as close to the end as you can.

, If you didn't have to cut the rod to remove the old tip top, you can remove it by applying heat to the glue holding it onto the rod tip and twisting gently to remove it. If the tip won't come off, you'll have to cut the rod at the end of the tip top as though the rod itself had broken there.


Avoid using too much heat, or you might damage the rod tip itself.

, You'll need a tip gauge, which is a card or piece of metal with holes. Insert the rod through each hole until you get a tight fit; whichever gauge size that hole is will be the size of tip top you need.

, Apply the glue to the rod tip, then affix the new tip top, gently twisting it into place so that it lines up with the other rod guides.


As the tip top guide is more prone to wear than the other guides, if you have to replace the tip top, you should get a replacement with a guide ring of either tungsten carbide or aluminum oxide, both of which are more resistant to grooving than steel. They are more susceptible to side impact damage (crushing), however.

Measure the diameter of the broken guide.,
Heat the epoxy sealing the guide wrappings.

,
Cut the wrappings on either side of the guide with a razor blade.,
Remove the old guide and the rest of the guide wrappings.

,
Put the new guide in place.,
Wrap the feet of the new guide to secure it.",How to Fix a Broken Fishing Rod3," You want a new guide with the same diameter as the original guide. (This is particularly important if the guide is the guide nearest the rod on a spinning reel, which is particularly large to accommodate line coming off the reel during a cast.)

,, Cut the wrappings on top of or on the edges of the guide feet if you can. Avoid cutting into the rod blank.

,, Be sure to line it up with the other guides so that its bottom center aligns with the bottom centers of the guides on either side of it.

, Check the alignment of the new guide with the other guides a final time before coating the new wrappings with epoxy resin or polymer to seal them in place.

Select the type of fishing you want to do.,
Choose the area you want to fish.,
Buy a fishing license.,
Get your bait and tackle.,
Determine what method of fishing is best for you and the body of water you will fish.",How to Fish in Florida," You will need the correct tackle, in some cases fishing licenses, and maps or a guide to lead you to where the action is.;
, The Florida panhandle's gulf coast offers good fishing in the spring for cobia, red fish, Spanish and king mackerel, and pompano, while the flats near the Florida Keys offers year round fishing for bonefish, and nearby inshore waters offers great snook fishing. Other species and fishing opportunities are:


Catfish can be caught in freshwater canals, rivers, creeks, and lakes statewide, and year around.
Largemouth bass are usually sought in rivers and lakes in warm weather, so fish the southern part of the state year around, and the panhandle from spring through fall.
Bream and other panfish can be caught in almost any body of water where sufficient food and oxygen are present.

, Florida requires either a saltwater or freshwater fishing license for persons 16 years old or older. Exemptions are for those over age 65, military personnel on duty in Florida less than 6 months, and disabled individuals. These people should get a free fishing permit from an office of the local tax collector prior to going fishing. You also will not be required to have a fishing license if you are fishing from the bank on freshwater lakes and streams that are not in a state management area, using a cane pole.

, Once you have selected the type of fishing you plan on doing, get the bait and tackle you will need to go fishing. You can find out specific suggested methods from local bait and tackle shops, or look for advertisements from guide services in the area you are planning to visit.

, Some larger lakes and rivers are more easily fished using a boat. There are special regulations for operating a boat in Florida, including limits on where gasoline motors can be used and safety equipment requirements.

Strip off about 20 feet (6 meters) of line from the tip of the rod and lay it in front of you.,
Pinch the line ahead of the reel against the rod handle with your index and middle fingers.,
Raise the rod to eye level.,
Lift the rod tip quickly, flipping the line behind you.,
Hold the rod upright just long enough to let the line straighten out behind you.,
Sweep the rod forward while pulling your elbow downward.,
Stop the forward stroke with a snap of your wrist when the rod returns to the 10 o'clock position.,
Lower the rod tip as the line straightens out to lay the line, leader and fly on the water.

",How to Fly Cast," While in the other forms of casting, you're casting a bait or lure, in fly casting, you cast the line in a manner similar to cracking a whip with a weighted tip.;
, You should hold the rod straight in front of you as you do this, reel down, with your thumb resting along the top of the rod handle.

, This is about 30 degrees above horizontal, or the ""10 o'clock"" position.

, You should do this quickly enough so the line's weight and movement bend the rod. Stop the backstroke when your thumb points straight up.


To make the line move faster, pull downward on it above the reel with your other hand as you lift the rod tip.

, At first, you may want to look behind you to watch the line straighten out, but you can eventually feel a slight tug as the line straightens.

, This will make the rod move faster, giving your forward stroke more power.


You can again make the line move faster by pulling downward on it with your other hand.

, Your thumbnail should be even with your eye at this point; the snap should be sharp enough that you can feel the rod tip whip forward.

Learn to care for your lures.",How to Fish With Lures," The primary purpose of fishing with a lure is to imitate as best as possible the movements of a fish's natural prey. Consequently, there is an enormous variety in the materials, colors, and shapes of fishing lures, each suited for a particular scenario, or fish. There's no such thing as ""the best"" lure and colour combination to use, so it's good to get a variety and see what works best for you and the fish you're trying to catch.The type and size of lure is generally determined by the fish species that you're targeting. Although there is no defined role for the various lures, the idea is to match a lure as well as possible with a fish's natural prey. For example, a bass usually feeds on tiny crayfish, making it less likely to bite a large fish-shaped lure.;
, A spoon is a lure which resembles the head of a spoon without the handle. This shape causes the lure to flutter in the water as it sinks, which then creates the illusion of an injured bait fish. The red devil, a red and white spoon, is very popular. The red stripes look like blood to a hungry game fish.

, Jigs are probably the most common lure used in both fresh and saltwater fishing. They consist of a weighted head and a tail made of feathers or plastic, which is used to conceal a hook. Often a piece of live bait will be attached to the hook to make the lure even more enticing, though this isn't strictly necessary.

, One of the most recognisable of fishing lures, a crankbait is usually made of plastic or wood and used primarily to fish for bass. This lure often features a bill on the front that looks a lot like a duck. Generally, the bill on the crankbait lure allows it to die to a pre-defined depth, allowing anglers to work a particular column within the water. Many crankbaits come with additional features such as trailing hooks and rattlers.

, A spinner is a type of jib with a blade that turns, pulling the lure through the water. Spinners and spoons are usually made of metal and either wobble or spin through the water in the same way as real fish and a spinner is a bit of a hybrid between crankbaits and spoons. Often, these lures feature a large single hook which is covered by some form of trailing material as well as a metal blade which spins in the water as the lure is being retrieved. These lures generally cause ""noise"" which can induce a fish to strike.

, Plugs are made of wood or plastic and work in a number of ways, skimming along the surface of the water, trailing in mid-water, or by trolling deep along the bottom. It's a versatile and very useful variety of lure to add to any angler's collection.

, One of the most useful and effective lure techniques is called ""walking the dog,"" because it resembles the type of wrist motion you might have while taking Rover for a stroll. For this technique, you'll use a surface lure with a weighted rear end.


Cast your lure and point the rod tip toward the water at a 45 degree angle. Move the rod tip downward to a 90 degree angle in a jerking motion. Turn the reel handle 1 turn for every jerk.
Move the rod slowly at first, and then gradually increase the speed to copy the movement of a bait fish swimming away.

, Mimicry is one of the most advanced lure techniques for experienced fishermen to use. It's a subtle and sophisticated way of catching fish that requires the use of two pop lures or plugs for the best effect.


Tie one lure behind the other on a monofilament leader and cast your lure out deep. Move the tip of the rod in a twitching motion, varying the speed in multi-directions, attempting to mimic the behavior of live fish. Use your wrist to keep the line relatively taut, jerking the lure around and varying your movements.

, Use a surface or topwater lure to imitate the behaviors of an injured or otherwise vulnerable bit of prey. If fish are hesitant, using this technique can get even cautious fish to start biting.


After you cast, leave the lure still in the water until the ripples go away, pausing and counting to 10 before you make a movement.
Move the rod tip, causing the lure to move in place very gently, then remain still for another brief period. Repeat brief movement of the rod tip, moving the lure in place. The movements should look erratic and sinking, but easy to catch., Use a crank bait or a diving plug lure to learn to drop your lure deeper into the water if you want to get into the deep territory where the bigger fish usually remain.


Cast your lure and let it remain still while the line starts to sink. Do nothing for several seconds, then slowly start to work the lure beneath the surface by making short retrieval reels, then letting it sink back down.

, Use a surface lure to skip your lure across the surface to mimic the behavior of a flying insect or some other kind of prey. This can be especially useful in catching sunfish or other shallow-water freshwater fish.


After casting, keep your line still until the ripples in the water go away, then sweep your rod down to the surface of the water. Use the sweeping motion either slowly or quickly depending on the assertiveness of the fish.

, Nothing could be easier on a lazy fishing day than trolling behind your boat with a spoon, plug or spinner lure. It's also extremely effective, mimicking the behavior of a traveling bait fish, minding its own business and covering a great amount of ground.


All you've got to do to troll a lure is cast behind a moving boat and wind the line in slowly as you move. Generally, you'll want to use the trolling motor and go extremely slowly.

, Fishing is a lot like chess, a game of quiet movements and subtlety, not herky-jerky nonsense. Most beginners jerk the line around too much. It's important to reel in very slowly, using calm and gentle movements on the line. If you're not catching anything, slow your movements down and be gentler with your rod.


If you get a bite immediately stop reeling in and very slowly move the lure left and right until the bobber goes under the water. The second it does yank very hard and forcefully. You do this because when the fish bites it and you yank, the fish will get the hook caught in it's lip and you can then reel it in.

, Using the ""right"" color of lure is generally determined by water clarity. Murky water and dusk or night fishing requires bright-colored lures more easily seen by fishermen and fish alike. White and red lures are common in these conditions, while clear water conditions would call for more muted or naturally occurring colors, like brown, blue, black, and green.

, When you're lure fishing, it's very important to move around and avoid playing out a particular area. Fish aren't as stupid as you think, and they'll start recognizing the lure eventually, making it less effective. If you get a lure spit back, it's time to move elsewhere.


Work the whole body of water and the different depths until you find the fish. Also work the lure at different speeds and change up the action.

, When you're fishing, as you reel your lure back in, take a few seconds to check the status of the lure and clean it up if necessary. In certain fishing conditions, lures can get gunky with weeds, twigs, and other debris, making them less effective at attracting fish and less effective at looking real. Make sure your lures are clean and ready to go before you recast.

, Its important to keep the hooks of your lures as dry as possible when not in use to prevent rusting. Rusted hooks need to be replaced as soon as possible, as they become greatly weakened and break when you need them the most. You can buy replacement hooks at bait shops and most outdoor supply stores.

Take it home for a great meal, or just let it go into the water.",How to Fish in a River," A good fishing pole would be one that has a sturdy, fiberglass or graphite, a line that won't snap easily, and other features that actually work. Choose a good size for the fishing pole, such as is 8 feet (1.5 meters).;
, Fish that live in rivers, such as sturgeon, bass, carp, catfish, etc., need bait that would attract them to your hook. They prey on many types of other fish and sea creatures, so find a bait that your target fish would want. Take an assortment of bait since you might be fishing for many types of fish.


Use thawed frozen chunks of sardines secured to magic string (flexible clear rubber string) wrapped around the no.3 hook.
Use blood worms for your lure. Rip off their heads or they might snap and bite your fingers. Just be careful not to splash blood on yourself. Thus, they are named blood worms.

, These glasses will help you look for fish more easily. You will be able to see through the river and find fish with them. This can prevent wasting time, as well as catching more fish. , Check with local fish and game agencies for catch limits, rules and regulations; they change every year.
See if you are allowed to keep the fish you catch if you are planning to do so. Some places only allow catch and release.

,


Choose a river that has a curved edge. Rivers that are curved are better to fish on the edge since the faster water (this usually carries the food that fish eat in water) moves to the edge of the bend. This is where fish usually look for food, and you can easily fish in that part of a river. Look for rivers with merging currents. When two bodies of flowing water meet, there will be more fish food flowing in the river, which means more fish may go in that part of the river to find food. Catch fish in a part of a river with merging currents - that way, you will catch quite a few. Catfish are attracted to fresh water streams, you can find them where streams and creeks meet the river.
Choose a river with places that have weeds and islands on them. Places where there are weeds have lots of fish hanging in that area since they like to shelter there and surprise attack their prey.Islands also have some good fish to catch there.Find a river that is calm. Calm rivers with no fast moving currents are great for fishing. The fish can easily smell the scent of the bait that way instead of a rushing river, where they can just zoom past without smelling the bait.Find a river with currents, but not as fast as just zooming past. This is only if you can't find a calm river. Choose a river to fish in that has slow currents. Fish can still be moving, but not as fast and can still smell their prey more easier in there.

, Ask an owner of the place the river is in and tell them if you can keep the fish or not. If you can't keep the fish and you do, you may be fined as well as other problems happen, since this may be illegal.

, Consider visiting the river where the fish are most active so you can catch more. Check the weather and make sure it is a good condition for fishing. Consider fishing when it rains. Fish like cold, wet water, so they will be most active at this time.Another good time to fish in a river is at dawn. Fish do not like direct light, and they seem to be active at sundown and sunrise. , Good baits are lures that have strong smells that a fish would normally eat as prey, but live bait is also helpful. This is called bottom bounce live bait. Be sure to bounce your bait with the currents, and not against it. , When you set the lure, a triangular shaped sinker is tied to a slider on the line to anchor the bait to the bank (river bottom) and keep it from rolling down with the current.

, Be sure you don't let go of the fishing pole, as it could break or get washed away by the fast currents. Hold the fishing pole tightly - the fast currents of a river can wash it away from your hands.

,, Or you could balance a tin can to warn you when a fish bites.

, Keep an eye on your rod so you notice if you catch anything.

, Thus, only with practice and experience you'll master that. Hence, fish are pretty clever. You'll find out that your bait is gone and was eaten before you even know it.

, If you do, the fish can slam into you. Pull it upwards and wait until it lands on the ground. Hold it down quickly so it doesn't flap away, and wait until it stays motionless. Carefully take the hook out of wherever it is sticking in the fish.

, Be sure there is nothing wrong with the fish so it survives. Let it into the river in the least part with a lot of rocks and rushing water.


You can use a tie rope to hold the fish you've caught anchored to shore alive while you fish for more.

Get some fishing gear.,
Walk, run, bike, or drive to your nearest body of water that contains fish.,

Cast towards the area (first put your bait on)and be patient.

,
Move the bait around by jerking a few times on your rod.,
When you get a bite (because you will, following these great directions), reel in moderately fast, keeping the tip of your rod up and keeping the line taut.

,
Grab the fish by the lip and jiggle the hook around until it comes out (this will take some practice).

,Gently slide the fish into the water and let it go.,Keep on fishing, pardner.",How to Fish from the Banks," This includes a rod, a reel, and a variety of lures, or bait. It would also be helpful to get a tackle box to store all of this in.;
, This is crucial.

, This can be done by looking for areas where you can actually see fish, finding holes; or deep areas of water, finding rocks, or finding an area where fast moving water meets slow moving water.

,, This makes it seem more lifelike. Also, if the bait contains rattles, it will shake them, attracting fish as well.

Get the right tackle equipment.,
String the right hook on the end of your line.,
Add the right bait to your hook.,
Locate the right spot to fish.,
Identify the sturgeon’s bite on your line, which can vary according to the outdoor temperature.,
Pull up on your fishing rod so that you secure the catch.,
Reel in the sturgeon as quickly as possible.",How to Fish for Sturgeon,"


A sturgeon fishing rod should be 6 to 9 feet (1.8 to 2.7 m) in length and made of a single piece (rather than a rod that is assembled).
The reel should be outfitted with line that can hold at least 80 pounds and have enough line to run 250 yards (228.6 m).;
, Many sturgeon fishermen recommend a hook size of 5/0 to 9/0, depending on the species of sturgeon you are fishing for.

, The adage “fresh is best” applies to sturgeon fishing.


Types of recommended bait include crawfish, fresh water clams, salmon eggs or carcasses, shad and other small fish.
If fresh bait isn’t available, adding scents to the bait will catch the attention of the sturgeon. Shrimp oil, shad oil and sardine oil are just a few of the many fish oils on the market.

, Ledges, small channels, sand flats and other rocky points are recommended when you fish for Sturgeon. Sturgeon move with the tides as they search for food.


If the tide is out, look for deeper water.
If the tide has come in, fishing in small beds of 4 to 6 feet (1.2 to 1.8 m) may produce a good catch.

,


During colder weather, the bites are slow and repetitive. The repetitive action will help you differentiate between a bite and the tide moving your line.
During warmer weather, the bite tends to be more aggressive. This occurs because the fish are getting close to spawning season (typically in July and August) and are more active. Look for the rod tip to dip and line movements.

, Once you feel the bites, it is important to yank the rod so that the hook lodges securely into the sturgeon.

, Remember that sturgeon can be quite large. Plant both feet and ask for assistance if you feel that the fish is too powerful.

Employ a sensitive and lightweight graphite rod when using jigs or plastic/rubber lures.,
Pitch your bait into or near visible brush and underwater debris.,
Cast your line and bait parallel to the shore, treeline or brushline you are working and draw the bait back toward you.,
Mimic fleeing or helpless prey with erratic movements when using topwater lures to activate the feeding and agitation response from bass.Create a back-and-forth or zig zag pattern on the surface of the water when you employ a walker lure.,
Cast out a jig lure and give the line plenty of time to hit the bottom.,
Don’t reel Plastic or Rubber lures in but rather retrieve it with purpose by lifting and dropping the rod as you take up the slack of the line.",How to Fish for Bass," During Winter and lower temperatures, bass will not expend much effort and will only bite when your lure is immediately within their strike zone.Bass are erratic during Fall but will feed closer to shore as the temperature drops. Spring and Summer provides ideal fishing conditions as Bass will feed closer to shore early in the morning and move out into open water around creek channels and structures later in the day.


Divide Spring into 4 segments to optimize the spawning behavior. Pre-spawn, spawn, post-spawn, and late Spring require different approaches.Pre-spawn has you fishing at around 8 - 15 feet in depth, spawn moves you up to a shallower depth towards their spawning beds, post-spawn moves you back down to 8-15 feet, and late spring is the optimum time to fish around structures and the shore.;
, Bass like to stay close to certain areas or hide within debris depending on the weather, time of day and which phase of their spawning cycle they are in. Vegetation, rocky bottoms, shallow flats, fallen trees, structures, bushes and grass are all great places to set your cast.

, Bass like to feed closer to shore in the morning and move out into open water later in the day. Fish off structures in late afternoon as Bass will look for shade and deeper water.

, These lures are quite versatile.Crankbaits come either lipless or with a lip and each is effective dependant on depth and the speed at which you reel.Use lipless crankbaits if you’re fishing in 1 foot of water or if you’re fishing as deep as 50 feet. You will have to reel faster or use a lighter lure in shallow water, whereas you will reel slower or use a heavier lure when fishing deeper water.Use a specific lipped crankbait depending on the depth of the water because they are classified as shallow, medium or deep diving based on a 10 pound nylon monofilament or fluorocarbon line.Use square bill crankbaits or crankbaits with round, stubby lips and sharp angled off noses when fishing for bass in shallow water, around wood or rock.Deploy medium-diving crankbaits when fishing in a 5-10 foot range. If you’re fishing 12 feet or deeper, use deep-diving crankbaits.
Lipless crankbaits can easily be ripped out of grass or bumped along a clean bottom whereas a lipped crankbait will hit something and kick outwards because the lip acts as a deflector.The shape of your crankbait determines how much movement you will get, which is important depending on the temperature of the water as bass are less active in colder temperatures.
With a more rounded-bodied crankbait you’ll get a wide wobble that is attractive to bass that are aggressive, usually when water is warmer; in contrast, a flat crankbait with narrow sides will have a tighter wiggle that is more appealing to bass in cold water who won’t react to large movements., Thanks to their unique blade shape, they can dive and be retrieved quickly.Spinner baits work best when it’s windy and cloudy because they are meant to cause a reaction from the bass. Use faster spinner baits in clearer water and slower ones in muddier water.Choose spinnerbaits in standard or weedless. A weedless spinnerbait is a good option if you are fishing in a lot of cover, but are also harder to set the hook on. Add a cheater hook to catch short striking fish.
There are 3 major blade types: leaf, Colorado, and Indiana. Each blade type is effective for different conditions.
The leaf blade is most effective when fishing through grass and in clear water when you want a fast retrieval. It is a long slender blade with rounded points on either end to allow a faster spin and less water resistance.Deploy the Colorado blade when fishing at night or in muddy and murky water. The rounded shape allows it to spin slower giving the bass more opportunity to bite.Utilize the Indiana blade as a compromise to the slower Colorado blade and faster leaf blade.
The larger the blade means that it is easier to maneuver around stumps, rocks, and other debris, while narrow blades move quickly through sparse grass., These lures are meant to ripple the water surface with popping and splashing as you retrieve it.In the spring, bright colors work best, and in the fall and winter, black white or gray work well.
Choose topwaters that produce a lot of noise and splash to get the bass' attention.
Topwater lures come in walkers, poppers, wakebaits, minnows/twitch baits, prop baits, buzzbaits, and frogs. Each different type of topwater lure is most effective in different conditions.Walkers are most effective when covering a lot of top water quickly because it keeps the bait in striking distance for the bass.
Poppers should be deployed when fishing around stumps, docks, bushes, rocks, and small areas that are covered because these lures will aggravate bass into biting.
Wakebaits work best in clear water when fish are attracted to the V shaped wake.
Minnows/twitch baits excel in clear lakes or small areas where bass may spook at aggressive lures. They are great during spawning when bass are guarding their nests.
Prop baits should be used in places with a lot of grass, especially during spawning season. They create a lot of movement even without moving a great distance, which keeps them in a bass’ striking range longer.
Buzzbaits should be used in sparse grass and places where you feel your lure might get snagged but you still want a topwater presentation. These are most effective after spawning during the late summer.
Frogs are meant to mimic real frogs so use them effectively around heavy grass. They can also be used around cover as they are one of the toughest lures to snag.

, The common plastic skirting attracts bass all year round.Bass will usually hit a bait while it is falling, so after it has sat on the bottom for a bit give the rod tip a small twitch to see if anything has picked up your bait.
Jigs are most effective when employed in cover or closed to cover so be aware of the risk of getting snagged. Jigs are meant to imitate crawfish so try to make them scoot along the bottom.Both jigs and plastic worms are best used slowly.
Use a ¾ ounce jig when fishing through thick grass.
Jigs are also effective when fishing on docks and piers because they provide protection from predators.

, These lures are the most versatile and the most effective because they are so lifelike. They can also be fished weighted or weightless.Floating plastics can be used just like a topwater, and any type of plastic can be fished weedless to allow fishing in extremely heavy vegetation.
Fish with plastic/rubber lures in the Winter when bass are not very active. These lures can still be effective in warmer weather if you employ slightly more movement but the only time these lures are ineffective are when bass are very active.Plastic/rubber lures work best when water is over 55 degrees. Use large lures that are 7-10 inches when the water is murky but shorter lures that are 4-5 inches when the water is clear and the bass are lethargic.Both rigs and plastic/rubber lures are best used slowly.

, Pair the correct size of line with your crankbait according to how deep you want the bait to run.


For example, use a 10 pound fluorocarbon line to lighten up a deep diving crankbait or you can use the same 10 pound fluorocarbon line to get a medium diving crankbait to stay at its deepest range., The weight will range from ⅛ ounce to 2 ounces.Remember that the slower you reel, the deeper your lure will swim while reeling fast keeps your lure shallow.Blade size also affects how deep your lure will go but you can also add a trailer to your hook for buoyancy and movement., Plastic/rubber lures come in different shapes and sizes but remember they are meant to mimic worms or lizards so use lines that won’t easily get snagged in vegetation or debris where worms or lizards would commonly be found., The ideal rod is lightweight, 6 ½ - 7 feet, with a medium action and medium soft tip. It’s important to ensure you use a sensitive rod because bass will often bump the blade before it strikes.A shorter rod will give you more accuracy in your cast but a longer rod will give your more power to set your hook, leverage when reeling in your bass, and distance to your cast.

, The ideal rod is lightweight, sensitive, 6 - 7 feet, fiberglass, and has a medium action tip or a light action tip based on the weight of your lure.A medium action rod can also be used if it can set the hook and be flexible during your cast. A ⅛ ounce lure needs a light tip while a 314 ounce lure needs a medium tip.
A sensitive rod helps you determine what type of structure you’re coming into contact with.
A 7 foot rod is effective when casting out a far distance and when using heavier baits. A 6 foot rod are more effective for accuracy when trying to cast towards fallen trees or in between structures.
Fiberglass rods allow bass to inhale the hook before it’s set as the flex on the rod keeps the hook from becoming dislodged.

, The ideal rod is lightweight, extremely sensitive, 6 ½ - 7 ½ feet, graphite, and has medium action and a medium light tip.When fishing deep water, sensitivity and weight are imperative so you can feel the bites without getting fatigued from holding up the rod in a 9 to 10 o’clock position over long periods of time.
Use a 6 ½ foot rod when fishing structures 20 feet or deeper and a 7 ½ foot rod when fishing anywhere shallower than 20 feet.
Graphite is faster and more sensitive than fiberglass, which allows you to set the hook fast. It’s vital to have a soft tip to ensure that there’s tension with the bass at all times as you can easily lose a fish if only the point of the hook is embedded.

, Bass hang out near and under structure to wait for an ambush opportunity to feed. As you become more confident with your cast, try skipping your bait off of structures to solicit a reaction strike from a nearby bass.


Bass will strike lures when they are hungry and when they are irritated.

, This will give your lure/bait a longer time in the strike zone and will, in time, increase your strike percentages because you're extending your bait's exposure to bass.


A savvy angler will work the percentages but don’t be discouraged when you don’t get a bite.

, Snap your wrist and rod tip downward at a sharp angle and then point the rod tip back to the lure quickly so it glides. Give a series of fast snaps to make the bait move from left to right.
Snap your rod tip downward to activate a poppers concave mouth and narrow tail.
Steadily retrieve your wakebait to utilize its sharp angled lip to cause it to shimmy back and forth.
Twitch and float minnows/twitch baits back to the surface to attract bass guarding their nests during spawning.
Use a series of short jerks on your rod to spray water with prop baits.
Steadily retrieve your buzzbait to employ its blade to curl the water, spitting and spraying during quick jerks.
Twitch frogs along the top of grass and water to get bass to explode onto your lure.

, Jigs and plastics are fished differently than other types of lures. Instead of reeling in to produce the ""action"", the bait is retrieved by moving the rod tip.


After the bait has hit the bottom and you have given it a twitch, slowly lift the rod tip until it points straight up in the 12 o'clock position. Let it sit there for a moment and then drop it down to the 9 - 10 o'clock position and reel in the slack. Repeat these steps until your line is in.
You'll have to have a good feel for your line to tell when a fish is biting so most people hold their finger against the line while lifting the rod tip.
Look for sudden resistance or bumping on the line, a line that goes slack suddenly or veers sideways. To set the hook, drop the rod tip very quickly to the 3 o'clock position, and pull back hard to 12 o'clock.
Use jigs around fallen trees where bass are hiding.
Brush piles on a rocky bottom, standing timber, thick grass, and flats are all prime locations to employ a jig.
Pitch or flip a jig around the angles where limbs connect to the trunks of fallen trees. Let the jig fall to the bottom with a semi-tight line.Drag or hop your jig down ledges or drops to mimic the movements of a crawfish.

, To fish a plastic/rubber lure, use the same technique as you would when using a jig. Cast out and give the line plenty of time to hit the bottom.

Watch out for bites.",How to Fish for Squid," Because you want to feel even the slightest changes while you’re fishing for squid, choose a light, long rod. You can use anything from a six to 20-pound line, but the lighter, the better.You really don’t have to invest in special equipment -- almost any type of rod and reel will work for squid fishing.;
, Squids have special eating techniques, which means they need special bait, too. A squid jig is the most popular type of bait. It has a body that looks like a fish, is illuminated to catch their attention, and has one or two rows of sharp points that allow them to be reeled in when they bite.All types of squid jigs will catch fish, and on some days certain colors will do better than others. It’s best to have a variety of sizes and colors to test until you find one that works.Popular sizes for squid jigs are 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5. The number indicates how quickly they will drop through the water per second.

, Less common than a squid jig but also successful is live bait. If you’d rather not invest in a squid jig or just prefer live swimmers, fish for squid using smaller squid, or with other common bait fish, like minnows., Squid fishing is mostly a nocturnal activity. Squid feed at night and are attracted to light, so it’s easiest to catch them after dark., Fish like to be in deeper water, where they feel more protected. That means if there’s a high tide, your chances of catching a lot of squid are even higher. Look at the calendar to find out when the tide is in and prepare to catch scores of squid!


Chances are even better at high tide on a cloudy or rainy evening.

, You are most likely to catch a lot of squid when it’s warm, so spring and summer to even early autumn are ideal times to go in most parts of the world.Check online to find out the specifics for squid fishing in your area.

, You don’t need a boat to fish for squid. Squid like to hide from predators in weeds, and the combination of grass and light at an illuminated jetty or pier makes it the perfect location for squid fishing.Seeing ink spots on decks or jetties is a big clue that squid have recently been caught there recently.
Stay away from places where boats or other fishermen are already hanging out.
You can also search online to find popular locations in your area for catching squid.

, If there’s no jetty nearby or if you simply prefer to be out on a boat, you can still have a lot of luck. Place lights on the bottom or sides of your boat or canoe. Or if you have a larger boat, you can use an underwater light, sinking it to the bottom and then bringing it back up to attract the fish.Choose a location over a weedy and sandy bottom.

, Tie your squid jig or bait onto your leader. Cast it out and let it sink to the depth that you think the squid may be hanging out. Jerk your line up two or three times, then let it sink back down again. Repeat until you reach the top.The most important thing is to keep the jig moving constantly in the water.
Varying the sink time -- from long to shorter and in between -- will help you figure out where the squid are hanging out in the water.
While not totally necessary, using a specialized squid rod will help you feel if the jig is brushing the seaweed or bottom.

, Tie your squid jig or bait to a float, which will let it hang at the depth where you think the squid are in the water. You will need to try several different depths to find the squid.


It’s a good method for shallow waters, because you don’t have to worry about your jig or bait getting caught at the bottom.

, A ledger rig is a series of hooks hanging off a single rig.Tie two squid lures from the main line of a rig that is attached to a small sinker, which will help it reach the desired depth.A ledger rig is good for fishing off a jetty/pier, because you can let it sit while you go egging with another jig.

, No matter which technique you use, if you’re not having much luck, try switching up the lure’s weight, size, or color and see which factor makes the biggest difference.If you use live bait, see if using another type of fish will work better. Alternately, you may want to switch to a jig if you’re really not having any luck.

, Squid have a unique defense mechanism: dark black ink that they shoot to scare away potential threats (like enthusiastic fishermen). Be prepared for your catch to squirt the dark stuff as you reel it in. Using a net to pull in the squid will help you watch out for ink. Wait until it’s finished shooting ink before you bring it onto your boat.If you do get ink on your clothes, hands, or boat, don’t stress. It is water soluble and will wash out if you act before it dries., Bring along a bucket or other container that’s big enough for the squid. Fill it with a little water and place your squid inside. That way, if any ink is left over, it’ll stay in the container and not all over your boat.


If the squid still looks fat or puffy when you bring it onto your boat, it’s likely still got some ink left.

, In addition to shooting ink, squid also have a parrot-like beak that they use to kill their food and bite at potential threats. Don’t let your fingers linger too long near the squid after you’ve caught it.

, After arriving at the warm water current frequented by tuna, the fish finder tells you where in the current the fish are and what their depth is.

, Once you find a school of tuna, the chum slick brings them near the boat. Use a liquid chum dispenser and a fish-attracting oil formulated for attracting tuna. You can also chum with live bait.

, You need to add the right size hook and egg sinker, a lead weight, to weigh the line down so the hook will sink when you pull out the line.


Bait your hook with anchovies, sardines, pieces of squid or other small fish. Each kind of bait has to be threaded on the hook in a specific way. Ask a more experienced angler to show you how to bait your hook.
Add a feather jig to your hook. This is a lure that resembles a small fish. The feathers attached to the back mimic fins and a tail, and conceal the hook.

, Pull out your line until your hook is at the same depth as the tuna and lock your reel.

,


Check your bait after approximately 10 minutes if you don't get a bite. Your bait might have fallen off or been taken by a fish who didn't get hooked in the process.
Begin jigging. Let the jig sink to the right depth, then pull it up. The fish will most likely strike the hook as it's sinking.

, If you try to set the hook too soon, you may jerk it out of the tuna's mouth, letting it escape.

, Keep the proper tension on your line so it doesn't break. Pull the tuna toward you as you brace yourself against the rail, then reel in the slack.

Keep an eye on your indicator.",How to Fish Gray Reef," In other words, they are not going to expend any more energy than what they consume. If you are fishing very fast water in the middle of winter, you will more than likely go home skunked. The trout just are not going to hold in that kind of cold water if there is very little food coming to them. Conversely, the same holds true in the middle of the summer with high water temperatures and low oxygen levels. The trout are going to seek out faster water or riffles where it is cooler and more oxygen is being dissolved into the river. That is why a lot of tailwater's fish best in spring and fall. With plenty of insect activity, moderate water temperatures, and good oxygen levels, feeding activity increases. Because some tailwaters are controlled and reservoirs are drawn down from different levels of the water column, you have a better controlled water temperature. This is why some tailwaters such as the San Juan River and Green River have become so popular. The fish tend to feed well throughout the year. Gray Reef, on the other hand, is fed by Alcova Reservoir - a fairly shallow lake compared to those listed above; therefore, there is more temperature fluctuation throughout the year, causing the trout’s feeding habits to change along with those temperatures. This doesn't mean that you cannot catch trout at Gray Reef in the middle of winter. You just need to stop and think about where the fish will be lying in a run during that time of year.;
, A typical nymph rig consists of a tapered leader with a strike indicator; split shot and one to two flies.

, The key to success for catching Gray Reef trout, whether nymphing or streamer fishing, is to be on the bottom. The Rainbows are big and lazy; they lie right on the bottom and wait for food to come to them. Setting up a nymph rig for Gray Reef, or any water for that matter, depends on the depth of the water you are going to fish. Typically you want to set your indicator twice the depth of the water you are going to fish. The fly shop guides will fish a nine foot leader when the flows are running at 500 cfs and will go to 12 or 14 feet (3.7 or 4.3 m) when the flows are running above two thousand. The most important thing to remember is to keep adding tippet and or split shot until your flies are bouncing on the bottom. You will know this when you see your indicator ticking as it is floating during your drift.

, The water at Gray Reef is rarely gin clear, so that eliminates the need for fluorocarbon leaders, which are expensive to begin with. The trout are not leader shy, so typically a 3x (8 lb.) tapered leader to the point fly and 4x (6 lb) tippet to the trailer fly are used.

, Add a 20-inch piece of tippet to the point fly. Tie the tippet right to the bend of the hook with the same kind of knot you tie your fly on with. Try to have the same amount of distance (about 18 inches) between the split shot to the point fly as you do from the point fly to the trailer fly. This lets the whole rig turn over while you are casting.

, Insect nymphs do not have the ability to swim very fast and are therefore carried along the bottom by the current, so a dead drift replicates this. The next time you see something floating down the river, notice how it is floating. It will be floating along at the same approximate speed as the water. Now envision your flies floating along the bottom of the river. They must be floating along at the same speed as the water, or they will look unnatural to the fish.

, A dead drift is achieved by casting up river and as your line and indicator is floating downstream you must put a mend in the line. A mend is basically achieved by putting a belly in the line in the opposite direction than what the current is naturally forming. For example, if you see a belly forming downstream during your drift, you will need to pick up the fly line a flip a belly upstream. All this does is to take the drag off the line so that the flies are not being pulled through the water and are drifting freely.

, If you see it stop or twitch, it is time to set the hook. Setting the hook is something that some do well and others struggle with. Ninety-nine percent of the time, the fish will be facing upstream. Therefore, you must set by lifting your rod with an up-and-downstream motion. Since this is in the opposite direction the fish are facing, you will have a much better hooking angle. You can also increase the time to pick up the line when setting, by pulling or stripping on the line that is in your hand. You do not need to set the hook hard, but rather fast and smooth. As soon as you feel resistance on the other end stop your setting motion or you will break off the fish and the jerk will be on the wrong end. If you have a successful hookup, let the fish run and get all the excess line with your reel. So many fishermen that have $300 reels with smooth drags fail to use them. They think stripping the fish back to them is the way to fight the fish. In reality, the drag on the reel is a lot smoother than what you can achieve by pinching the line between your fingers.

Tie your sabiki rig to your line, and weight the opposite end of the sabiki with a small diamond jig lure.

,
Cast your line as far as you can into the harbor, and then reel your line in slowly.,
When you get a bite, stop jigging and simply reel in your line at an even, steady pace.,
Don't be surprised if you hook another fish or two on your sabiki while bringing in the first fish.,
If you don't catch a fish on the first cast, don't worry!",How to Fish for Mackerel in New England," The average mackerel weighs a little less than a pound, so you won't need a heavy rod & reel combination. A light spinning reel on a five foot pole and 6lb. or 8lb. test fishing line will allow for good casting and will be sturdy enough to reel in your catch.;
, My secret to catching lots of mackerel is Sabiki. Sabiki is a Japanese word meaning bait rig. The typical sabiki has a center line and several branches with decorated hooks tied to the end of each branch. One end of the center line has a snap onto which you'll attach a small weight, diamond jig, or other weighted lure. The other end has either a loop or a swivel, onto which you'll tie the line from your fishing pole. You will probably lose at least one or two rigs over the course of the day, so it is best to have three sabiki rigs and three diamond jigs (for weight) if you plan to fish for more than a few hours.

, Mackerel are easiest to catch from late spring to mid summer, before the bigger fish migrate north and start chasing them out of the harbor.

, New England has many harbors and plenty of coastline, and the fish can be nearly anywhere. Although you'll be fishing within a few feet of the surface, you'll still want deep water, so docks and piers work better than surf-casting at the beach.

,, Jerk the fishing pole upward once every twenty seconds or so. This is called ""jigging"" and will make your sabiki rig seem like a frightened school of small fish - dinner for your mackerel!

, If you reel in too fast, your fish may break free. Mackerel like to swim side to side to try to escape, so enjoy the ride while you reel him in.

, Other mackerel in the school might mistake your fish's struggle for jumps of joy at the delicious food he's eating, and want to try some too! You may bring in up to four fish on a single cast, and more often than not, you may catch at least two at a time.

, You may be jigging for an hour or two before your first bite. Be patient; the school will swim by and see your rig eventually.

Consider taking your gar home for dinner.",How to Fish for Alligator Gar," The gar thrives in the Mississippi river basin, from Southern Ohio and Illinois to the Gulf of Mexico. Mostly found in the freshwater bodies of Texas, Alabama, Louisiana, and Arkansas, the alligator gar is a distinctively Southern fish. As with many things, the biggest are generally found in Texas.


The Henderson Swamp west of Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Lake Pontchartrain, north of New Orleans, are populated with Alligator Gars.
So are the Pearl and Pascagoula River in Mississippi, the Mobile, Tensaw, Tennessee, and Tombigbee Rivers in Alabama, and the Escambia, Choctawhatchee, and Apalachicola Rivers in the Florida panhandle.
Texas rivers such as the Colorado, Trinity, Guadalupe, Sabine, and other main channels are most frequented and have the largest record gars to date, as well as the largest known populations of alligator gar.;
, A ""dead lake"" is a lake that is inundated by an adjacent river when the water is high, but is landlocked when the river is at normal level, and this is the perfect kind of place to fish for gar. Secure permission to fish this water, and whatever licenses are required in the jurisdiction you are fishing in.


You will need to have access to fish your choice of locations, so if there is no bank access, you may have to secure a boat.

, The alligator gar is just one species of gar, a long-nosed, sharp-toothed, distinctively prehistoric fish. They can weigh over 250 lbs and can survive up to two hours above water. The gator is the largest species of gar, and is the largest exclusively freshwater fish in North America. It can be as long as eight to ten feet, and the current world record for the largest alligator gar caught on rod and reel is 279lb 0oz. The largest taken by Bowfishing is 365lb.If the gar's snout is more than twice the length of its head, and is no more than a few inches wide, it's probably a longnose gar.
Florida gars and spotted gars have shorter snouts and are covered with distinctive, brownish spots.
The alligator gar--your target--is the largest of these fish. It has a broader nose than the long nose, with two rows of teeth where the other gar have one. It can be quite large.

, The gar spawns in brackish waters in spring, around April, but the best time for hunting them is in late summer, when it is hot and dry.


In July and August, alligator gar can be found in deep river bends adjacent to relatively shallow pools. The deep water is where the gar congregate, and the shallow water will allow you to spot them more easily when they come up to feed.

, If you're going to try to hook a fish that weighs up to 250 pounds and has dozens of sharp, needle-like teeth, you're going to want more than a branch and bobber. Bring a stiff composite rod with strong test line. This is the kind of fish you'll want to bring up to the surface, so using a bobber for your bait is appropriate.


It's best to have a large open-faced or spinning reel capable of hold 150–200 yards (137.2–182.9 m) of 30-100 pound test mono-filament line. A stiff-actioned graphite or composite rod, six or eight feet long is appropriate for this size of fish.

,


Hook bait onto a 6/0 treble hook and use a 1/4 oz. slip sinker, with split shot sinker to keep it above the hook.Plastic or cork bobber (float), capable of keeping your bait and rig suspended near the water's surface.

, Some people in the lower delta waters near the Gulf Coast prefer 10–12 inch (25.4–30.5 cm) mullet, and often suggest removing the scales before using them, but any legal baitfish, such as shiners, shad, or suckers are on the gar's menu.


Carp, buffalo, and large perch are also commonly used.

, When you spot a school of fish breaking the water as if they are being herded by a hungry carnivore, you are probably in gar country. Rig your bait, and cast.

, Leave the spool open to allow the gar to take the bait and run with it for a few clicks. Keep your eye on the float. When it begins to torpedo across the top of the water, or when it dives towards the depths, you know you've got a gar on the line. Lower your rod toward it, and wait at least seven seconds after the line pulls tight.


The gar swims with its food before attempting to eat it. If you try to set the hook to early, you'll risk jostling it loose or hooking the gar in a less-than-optimum spot.

, The alligator gar has a hard, bony plate in its mouth, which is the reason fishermen prefer treble hooks, and considerable force is needed to penetrate it. To ensure that you set the hook in the soft, secure part of the gar's mouth, you may have to set it a few times. Since you've let as much as a few hundred yards of line spool out, this may take considerable strength and a few pulls.


When you've got your hook set, it's time to settle in for a big wrestling match.

, Very large fish will require a substantial fight to land, and you may find it necessary to adjust your drag to wear it down. Try to keep the fish steered away from logs, brush, or other snags to keep him from becoming tangled, where you will almost certainly lose him.

, Bring it in a bit at a time, letting the gar wear itself out. Don't expend more energy than necessary bringing it in quickly. Never try to force even a smaller gar into the boat while it still has fight left in it. The alligator gar has been known to bite aggressively in self defense. For very large gar, it may be best to gill gaff them, so that the head (and teeth) can be steered away from occupants of the boat before bringing it aboard.


A gill gaff is basically a pole with a sharp hook on the end, for snaring large fish beside the boat. Generally, a partner will hook the fish through the gills and under the backbone, probably wounding the fish mortally. If you want to hook a gar and release it, don't do this.

, Generally, fishermen don't recommend fishing for gar unless you intend to kill them. Bringing a live gar into the boat, or onto the shore, is extremely dangerous. Removing a treble hook from a mouth full of needle like teeth requires a very long-nosed pair of pliers. Make sure the fish is beyond exhausted, and that you're wearing protective arm and hand gear if you attempt this.


Cutting the line will leave the treble hook embedded in the fish's mouth, leaving it little chance of survival.
The alligator gar and many other freshwater predators are increasingly endangered. The best preservation policy with these fish is catch and release, so at least be aware of the difficulties of doing so if you want to hunt gar responsibly.

, Many southerners will tell you the preferred method of fishing for alligator gars is actually bowfishing, using a compound hunting bow and fishing arrows. Bow-fishing is much more exciting to many, as it combines fishing and hunting.


Some fishermen will likewise bring along a .22 to finish off the gar when it gets close to the boat. Be extremely careful and make sure that you're licensed if you're going to fish with hunting gear.

, Generally, the gar is a trophy fish, given its size and fierce look. It is an edible (some say tasty) fish, but quite difficult to clean. The scales are armor-like and all come off together, though, so it comes off with the right technique.


Nail the gar's head to a blank and work a knife from the tail up the backbone, loosening the scales. Cut the head and tail off, and then work your knife down the sides of the fish. The scales should come up like a crust around the flesh underneath. Gut the fish as you would any other.

Some steelhead spend only 1 year in the ocean before returning to fresh water to spawn. These fish tend to spawn any time from late spring to midsummer and run in lengths from 23 to 26 inches (58 to 66 cm) and weights of 4 to 6 pounds (1.8 to 2.7 kg).
Some steelhead spend 2 years in the ocean before returning to fresh water to spawn. These fish tend to spawn from late summer to early fall and run in lengths of 31 to 34 inches (79 to 86 cm) and weights of 10 to 13 pounds (4.5 to 5.9 kg). These steelhead may also go a longer distance to spawn than steelhead that spend only a single year in the ocean before spawn.
Some steelhead spend 3 years in the ocean before returning to fresh water to spawn. These fish can run in lengths over 37 inches (94 cm) and weights over 20 pounds (9 kg).If you’re not fussy about the size of steelhead you’re looking to catch, steelhead fishing generally starts to get good in early summer, peaks in early fall, and starts dropping off at the start of winter, then picks up again somewhat during mid-winter. Peak times vary according to how far upstream you are and also how far from the equator your location is.;
, Steelhead return to the freshwater area where they were spawned to lay their eggs and rear the next generation. As the swim upstream can be arduous, they look for places to rest along the way. Both holding and resting places can be prime places for anglers to present their offerings.


Look for water that flows fast enough to provide the steelhead with oxygen, but not so fast that the flow would exhaust the fish if they tried to hold position in it.
Look for a deep area that the steelhead can escape to if threatened. In streams, this usually means the outer bend, which is usually deeper than the inner bend.Look for rocky areas. Boulders and gravel areas often attract steelhead, as they can use the rocks to shield themselves from the brunt of fast-moving current while taking in the oxygen they need.
It’s a good idea to spend time familiarizing yourself with the area where you plan to fish for steelhead to learn how well visited the area is and what the fish’s habits are., Steelhead can be caught using a variety of baits or lures. Fishermen have used any of the following successfully:


Shrimp/prawns. This is what steelhead commonly feed on in the ocean. They can be used by themselves or to sweeten jigs and plugs.Eggs. Like other trout, steelhead are cannibalistic and will eat the eggs of other steelhead and other fish, as well as their own eggs.Eggs can be used jointly with shrimp.Spoons. Polished silver can be particular effective.
Spinners. The blade of a French spinner can be as attractive as the wobble of a spoon.
Plugs. Although more typically associated with bass fishing, plugs can be effective in catching large steelhead – and large rainbow trout, as well.
Flies. Like strictly freshwater rainbow trout, steelhead will take flies. Unlike strictly freshwater trout, they aren’t attracted to a particular type of fly at a particular time, as steelhead generally don’t eat much during their spawning runs. Flies thus don’t have to “match the hatch,” but they do have to be appropriate for water conditions, with larger, brighter flies (hook size up to 1/0 or 2/0) more appropriate for muddier water and smaller, duller flies (hook size 6) more appropriate for clear water., As noted, when steelhead are swimming upstream to spawn, they don’t stop to eat. They will, however, hit any bait or lure that makes them curious or annoys them into eating it. There are several methods you can use to present your offering to make them take it:

Drift fishing. This is the method most steelhead anglers employ when using tackle other than fly tackle. It involves putting a sinker 30 inches (75 cm) above the hook, often with a bobber further up the line. Cast the bait slightly upstream and let the current drift it in front of the steelhead.






Float fishing. Similar to drift fishing, except the bait is not expected to be moved around by the current. It also involves using a sinker to take the bait under the surface and a bobber to provide lift and indicate when a fish has taken the bait.






Back trolling. Often used with diving plugs near the mouths of rivers, this method involves letting out about 50 feet (15.2 m) of line, setting the motor in reverse, and trolling downstream stern first at a slight angle to let the current push the lure from side to side as the boat pulls it along. (This method could also be employed using a bow-mounted trolling motor on a forward-moving boat.)Deep water casting. Used near the mouths of rivers, this method involves casting and slowly retrieving spinners, spoons, and buzz-bombs into deeper areas."

After each trip, write notes on a calender on the fishing action you experienced.,
Buy a calender with the moon phases and tide chart.,
Watch fishing shows, read fishing books and magazines, and follow the advice of other people.

,
Carry a clipping of the tide chart when fishing, and schedule meal breaks, traveling or resting when it is not favorable such as a full, high tide.

,
Relate the position of the moon to the tide.,
Study the effects of fishing action at the moon rise and set.,
When night fishing, fish for big fish when the moon is smaller and small fish when the moon is bigger.,
If using a light, at night, notice the shadows it casts on the water.,
When night fishing, to draw fish with a light, such as a lantern that is always on, choose a darker moon phase or the time of night before or after the moon rises or sets.,
Fish by the moon phases for the different fish species in addition to fish size.",How to Fish by the Moon," Include the specific times of the day, for fishing action you experienced. Fishing action includes strikes and nibbles, and not just the fish that you landed.;
, Get the moon phases and daily tides from the newspaper or the internet as an alternative.

,,, If the moon is out, from its position in the sky, you will be able to know what is the tide phase.

, During this changeover, fishing can be fast and furious.

, Big fish are leery of light and swimming into shallow water.

, When after big fish, you must have some shadows in the water. Ideally, when after big fish, do not use a light that is on all the time, instead use a little penlight when fixing your rigs or baiting.

, Plankton seek the light, small fish seek the plankton and big fish hunt the small fish. A lantern will not draw much plankton if the moon is full.

, Study fishing around the full moon, last quarter and first quarter in this order of importance. Test the advice of your local fishing experts.

Tell Someone.,
Be prepared!,
Hire a local guide.,
Bring what you need.,
Bring the right type of Clothing.,
A light weight long sleeve shirt, light weight durable long pants, a wide brimmed hat,leech socks, and sturdy shoes.,
If you are in an area with leeches get leech socks which are usually made with a tightly woven cotton bottom and a nylon gator which goes to the knee you tuck your pants into.,
You should also carry a change of socks and a spare shirt, it's nice to have dry things to change into.

,
Underwear...Since you will be sweating and or otherwise getting wet again a synthetic fabric is a good choice so you don't chafe or get ""monkey butt"" Or you can go commando (which derives from soldiers not wearing underwear or socks in jungles for better air circulation) to reduce incidences of trench foot and fungal crotch.

,
Pack.,
Be sure to bring the Essentials.,
If you are lost find running water, a river or stream.Follow it down usually to people.If you get off a trail the jungle literally ""closes in"" around you, you won't be able to see more that ten feet in any direction so a river can be a road out.

,
Stay hydrated!,
Water is heavy so most people don't carry enough so even if you're on a day hike carry a means of purifying water i.e.,
If you don't have a way of purifying water you can use big wide palm or banana leaf to collect rainwater or that pack cover you wisely brought.

,
Have a way of building a fire.,
Matches are the least reliable...remember humid and wet?,
For the same reasons matches aren't reliable, humid and wet...you should carry some form of tinder.,
Or commercially available tinder is OK. A sun based method like a magnifying lens is hard to use as there may not be any sunlight in a dense jungle or cloudy sky's.

,
Don't forget food.,
Never forget a knife.,
Something like a multi-tool is also a great option, there are many to choose from the Leatherman Wave is great it has locking blades, a saw, scissors and of course the pliers.,
Let there be Light.,
Be sure to have some types of navigational tools.,
Pack a bandanna.,
Keep it with you.,
Don't forget the extras.,
Get a light weight nylon waterproof tarp.,
If you have room in your pack a hammock (even the net style survival type works in a pinch) is the best way to sleep in the jungle, the ground is usually wet and bug ridden, with a hammock and tarp you'll be quite comfortable.,
Stay clean!!,
A small stove.

,
Solid fuel stoves are easy to use and light so if you can't get a fire going you can heat water in your can.

,
A larger flashlight and spare batteries.

,
GPS.,
A pack towel, small light towel.

,
A small machete or ""parang"" (bigger is not better) and as with all tools learn how to use it properly and safely.

,
Fishing gear.

,
Tobacco.,
The jungle is a great place to experience nature and enjoy being in the bush.",How to Prepare for a Trip to the Jungle," Anytime you venture into an area without phones, police, or infrastructure you need to inform someone of exactly where you will be and how long you plan to be there. This includes family, friends, and local authorities like rangers or police. Also inform them when you return safely. Leave a note in your car explaining who it belongs to and how long you plan to be out.;
, The Boy Scout motto is a wise, time tested method of any form of travel. Preparation includes not only what you carry but what you know about where you will be. So do some research, find out the weather conditions, what kind of hazards to expect.What is the purpose of the trip? Are you day hiking, camping, or heading for a destination?

, If you are unsure of the area or just want to learn more about where you're going a guide can be well worth the money and are invaluable sources of information.

, Depending on the length of your trip and what you want to do there here are some basic things you should have with you.

, Most jungles are hot, humid, and wet places. They are also full of things which bite, sting, stab, scratch or otherwise make you uncomfortable so dress for protection.

, The zip-off style trekking pants are a great option if you want to cool off in a river or in an area without leeches or other hazards you can have instant shorts.

, Synthetic fabrics will dry faster and since you will get wet, yes you will get wet... From sweating, rain, stream crossing and dripping leaves when you stop to rest. So synthetics or very light cotton will dry much faster than a T shirt and jeans.

,,, A pack sized for the length of the trip is a good way to carry what you need. Get one with a ventilated back and a rain cover. Even if the material is ""waterproof"" the jungle has a way of defeating most waterproof fabrics so the cover gives an extra layer of protection as well as other uses.

, First is your Brain. If you get lost or stuck out in the jungle Keep Your Head! Stop, Think, Be positive! If people are expecting you back they will be looking for you when you don't return. With a calm mind and clear thinking you will get through it.

,, In hot humid climates you will sweat and dehydrate quickly. Make sure you drink plenty of water, remember when your thirsty it's too late.

, A water filter, purification tablets, or a way of boiling water. Never trust water in a stream or river is safe to drink!

,, A fire is good for a lot of reasons, boiling water, signaling and just making you feel better. You should have a least 2 or 3 methods of starting a fire.

, Even waterproof matches will likely fail in the jungle. A butane lighter or two, a flint/steel sparking device (blast match, Spark-Lite™, permanent match, etc.) or what ever you can carry.

, Most likely the wood you find will be damp if not wet, so something that will light and stay lit is a good way to start a fire in the jungle. A butane lighter and some strips of old bicycle inner tube work well even wet! Candles work well too.

,, Apart from air and water if you spend any time out in the bush you will need to eat. If you are not familiar with what you can and can't eat in the jungle it's a good idea to carry some ""survival rations"" A few ""energy bars"" are a convenient way to carry a bit of food. The jungle provides a lot of stuff like; bananas, coconuts, and other fruit. The streams are full of small fish and crayfish. As well as lots and lots of insects (just be careful with bugs, if its really colorful, it's not good to eat!)

, A knife is a very, very useful tool. We've all seen the movies with guys in the jungle hacking away with big machetes or Rambo with his huge pig sticker. You don't need a huge knife, they're heavy and hard to use.. Try cleaning a small fish with a machete! That being said the Malaysian ""Orang Asli"" (original people) carry a parang which is about the length of your forearm with most of the weight at the front. It is indispensable for constructing shelter or if you do need to clear a trail, It's the Jungle ""camp axe"" and if you spend any time there like camping it's very useful.

, But even a small fixed blade knife is a great choice.

, A small LED light is a good thing to have if you need to do anything at night (think urinating) you will welcome a light!

, A small well made compass and if available a map. Navigating in the jungle is very difficult, often you can't see more than a few yards in any direction. If follow a stream or river downstream there's a good chance it'll lead you out.

, Tie it around your neck, wet it occasionally to keep you cool. Or drape it down your neck to protect it from sun and bugs.

, All of these things should be on your person! In your pockets or on a cord around your neck. A commercially available survival kit will have a lot of this stuff, or you can make your own. Remember to do your research read reviews of the kits. Just remember it won't do you any good if it's not on you!

, Now some things to carry in your pack. If you're on a day hike you can leave some of this out.

, 7' x 10' is a good size, with some cordage (rope, string, dental floss or vines) you can rig a roof over you. Better yet, practice making a lean to shelter.

,


If all you have is a tarp and it's not raining, with some rope you can make a hammock from the tarp. If your really industrious you can make a roof from bamboo and palm/banana leaves. The jungle has lots of useful stuff bamboo, wide leaves, vines etc. With a bit of imagination and work you can make anything!
Rope. Some small diameter rope, or strong string is really useful. If you can get 550 paracord it's the best.
Water container
Wire. Thin stainless steel wire for snares, repairs, and making things.
Mosquito head net and good insect repellent. Also a mosquito net to use while sleeping is nice and it can be used to trap fish.
A one pound coffee can makes a good, cheap cook pot, and with the lid you have a watertight container to keep things dry in your pack.
A small first aid/repair kit, with bandages, tape, antibiotic ointment, needles, thread etc.
A pair of sandals to give your feet and walking shoes a break if you are going to camp.
Talcum powder, to help you get and stay dry at night.
Soap!

, It's good for your health and peace of mind.

,,,, Learn how to use it...easier than a compass...Mark your position when you start and ""backtrack"" to get out.

,,,, Even if you don't smoke you can use tobacco as a leech repellent. Make ""tea"" from the loose leaves and soak the cotton portion of the leech socks. You can also apply it to cotton clothing (it may stain). Leeches don't like the nicotine. Jungle natives rub tobacco on their skin.

, Remember the jungle isn't good or bad it just is...

Avoid sleeping at altitudes that are too high.,
Be prepared to turn around.",How to Prepare for a High Altitude Hike," Plan the amount of training you will do based on the difficulty of your hike, and your current fitness level. If you are reasonably fit, and attempting a challenging hike, then you will probably want to schedule at least 5 months of training before your hike is scheduled. If you are really out of shape, you may need to train for much, much longer.Remember that you can never start training too early, but you can start too late.
Have a talk with your doctor to make sure that you will not be endangering yourself by taking on this challenge.;
, If possible, train for your hike at altitudes at or above 5,000 feet (1,524 m). This will create the ideal training situation, as your body will get used to performing in low oxygen conditions.If this isn’t an option for you, don’t worry. There are several other steps you can take to train yourself for your hike.

, Biking is one good way to improve your cardiovascular fitness. If you are not training at higher altitudes, you can still improve your fitness by biking up hills whenever possible.Be sure to wear protective gear while you are biking. A helmet should not be optional. You won’t be able to enjoy your hike if you seriously injure yourself because you chose not to wear protective gear while training.

, Another excellent way to improve your cardiovascular fitness is to swim. An added advantage of swimming is that it forces you to control your breathing (since you have to hold your breath during certain strokes).Stick to strokes such as the crawl stroke (also known as freestyle), which will require you to keep your face in the water for a few strokes before you turn your head to breathe. Practice holding your breath for up to 5 or 6 strokes before taking a breath if you can.

, Another great way to train for your hike is to get into running. Next to actual hiking, running will be the most similar type of training in terms of movements, so this will be a great way to get your legs prepared for what lies ahead.If you have never run before, you will have to start out slow, but eventually you will want to work your way up to 3 to 5 days of training for 30 minutes to an hour each training session. During each session, you will want to train at a pace that keeps your heart rate at 70% to 85% of your maximum heart rate.
You can calculate what your maximum heart rate should be by subtracting your age from 220. Therefore, if you are 20 years old, your maximum heart rate would be 200. Meaning that you should try not to ever let your heart beat faster than that. 70% of your maximum heart rate would then be 140, and 85% of your maximum heart rate would be 170. Thus, during your training, you will want to keep your heart beating between 140 and 170 beats per minute (BPM)
A heart rate monitor is perfect for this. Typically, a heart rate monitor is a strap you can purchase at online or at sports supply stores. The strap wraps around your rib cage, just below your chest. The strap then, typically, reports your BPM to a watch that you wear on your wrist.

, This is another great way to do something that resembles what your hike will be like. You can find a tall building, put your pack on, and simply start walking up the stairs. Try to do something like this at least one day per week.If you can’t find a tall building, look for a local high school football stadium. Here, you can walk up and down each row of stairs over and over again. Aim to train for 30 minutes to an hour.

, When you are hiking, you will likely be carrying all of the supplies you need for your entire trip in a big backpack, which means it could be pretty heavy. Pack in everything you will want to take on your trip and wear it while you are training (or at least the weight of what you plant to pack), this way you will know what to expect, and whether or not you can manage the weight you have packed.If you are struggling to carry the weight at a low altitude, then you need to reduce the weight significantly, as you definitely won’t be able to manage it at a higher altitude.
Obviously you can’t wear the pack when swimming, but you can wear it on the bike, while running, or even while out for a walk.

, While there is not much scientific evidence that Gingko Biloba makes a huge difference, some believe that it helps their performance while hiking by improving circulation. If you decide you would like to take this supplement, follow the instructions on the packaging, and begin taking the supplement at least one week before your hike. Again, the scientific evidence regarding this claim is limited, but it won’t hurt you to take it, if you want to.Some hikers also recommend taking vitamin C supplements to help reduce free radical circulation during the hike.If it won’t add too much weight to your bag, consider taking the supplements during your hike as well.

, Though you may think you are the picture of health, it would be wise to visit your doctor for a check up before you go. Explain that you are about to take on a high altitude hike, so you want to make sure there aren’t any underlying health issues you should be concerned about.Ideally, you should schedule this visitation before you begin your training so you don’t set yourself up for a disappointment a week before your hike.

, How much planning you need to do depends on where you are hiking. If you’re following a well-known hiking trail, you can contact the organization responsible for it’s maintenance. They will usually send you maps and safety information about the routes you are interested in (sometimes in exchange for a minimal fee). If you are planning to hike through relatively uncharted territory, then planning your route will require considerably more attention.You need to ensure that you are allowed to hike in the area. The land you want to hike on may be privately owned, which means there may or may not be an agreement allowing you to hike there. Therefore, you should contact the local area commissioner. Tell them about your planned route, and ask them if you will be violating any laws by hiking there.
Don’t forget to consider the time of year. During the winter, the days are shorter, and you won’t have as much daylight so you won’t be able to hike for as long. On the other hand, if you are hiking in a very hot climate, it may not be advisable to hike during the hottest part of the day.
It is recommended that you do not hike for more than six hours each day.
Be sure that you understand what all map symbols mean, and ensure that your planned route does not take you through terrain that you cannot cross. For example, if you plan to cross a river, where will you be able to cross safely?
Have at least one detailed, alternative route. Ideally, you will have two or three routes, but you must have at least one. In case of emergency, you need to know how you can find help quickly. You also need to have alternative routes in case your planned route is not accessible for some reason.

, You should not take on a high altitude hike alone. Ideally, you will be going in a group of two or more. In any case, let someone at home know your exact hiking plan. When you will begin the hike, when your scheduled end date is, and the exact route of the hike. Give them a number where they can reach you (if you have one), and let them know when you will get in touch.


This may sound scary, and in most cases, it will be for nothing, but it is better to be safe than sorry as nature can be very unpredictable.
If you are hiking from place to place each day, let someone in the town know when you will be arriving. For example, if you plan to sleep at a hostel one night, tell them what your planned arrival time is, and what trail you are hiking. This way, they will be more aware if you don’t arrive within a couple of hours of your expected arrival.

, This will allow your body to acclimate to the reduced amount of oxygen in the air. During this time you can make sure all of your gear is packed properly.During your waiting time, do some moderate exercise to get your body ready for the hike.
You can also enjoy a short vacation before your hike, enjoying the area around the starting point, and meeting some other people who might also be doing the hike.

, On a hike, the weather can vary greatly. At higher altitudes especially, temperature can fluctuate greatly. Therefore, try to be prepared for several scenarios. Have long pants, a long-sleeved shirt, a hat, and a pair of gloves that will protect you from several potential weather scenarios.Consider the time of year as well. If you are hiking in the summer, be prepared for higher temperatures, but be aware that temperatures can still drop below freezing at night. During the winter, be prepared for potential freezing temperatures, as well as snow.

, The sun’s rays are more powerful at high elevations, so make sure you have plenty of sunscreen to apply to any skin that will be exposed during your hike.Make sure to choose a sunscreen that has an SPF of at least 30.
Remember that the sun can still affect you even if it is overcast.

, Just like sunscreen protects your skin from the harmful rays of the sun, sun glasses protect your eyes. Without them, you will likely be very uncomfortable hiking all day if it is sunny and/or snowy.Squinting into the sun for a long time is likely to give you a headache.
Snow can be very blinding, especially when it is sunny.

, If it is winter, make sure the hat is warm. In summer, the hat will be mainly to protect you from the sun.If you have the space, pack a warm weather hat and a cool weather hat. That way you will be prepared if the temperature drops significantly.

, Probably one of the most important things you can pack is your hiking boots. Don’t try to break in a brand new pair of hiking boots on a long hike. It could leave you with painful blisters. Instead, opt for a pair you have already been using, who’s comfort and sturdiness can be relied upon.If you don’t have any hiking boots, and have purchased some new ones for your hike, be sure to break them in before the big hike. You should be wearing the boots you want to hike in during your training so that they will be broken in, and you will know that you can comfortably wear them for several hours.
Don't forget to pack plenty of fresh socks. In the winter, make sure the socks are thick and warm. In the summer, make sure the socks are designed to wick the sweat away from your feet.

, If you are going on a hike that will last longer than a day, make sure you have the proper sleeping gear. Temperatures can drop significantly overnight at high altitudes, so make sure you have a sleeping bag that will keep you warm enough to sleep comfortably.


Newer tents and sleeping bags can be folded up in to a remarkably small package, and weigh very little. Consider investing in a good one if you plan to go hiking often. If not, rent or borrow a tent and sleeping bag.

, A sleeping pad is an inflatable or foam pad that goes between the ground and your sleeping bag. The purpose of these is to add additional comfort, but also to help keep you warmer. Using a sleeping pad will help keep you from losing heat into the ground.Some people prefer the more expensive inflatable pads, but be aware that these are typically heavier than foam pads, and can puncture if you don’t pay attention to where you put it.
Foam pads are less expensive, but may also offer slightly less support. If you have room in your bag, consider taking both a foam and inflatable pad. This will give you double the comfort, and will provide the best insulation.

, If you are going on an overnight hike, and won’t have a place to stop for meals, be prepared by packing a cooking unit (available at nearly all outdoor stores), as well as food to prepare. Many outdoor stores sell dehydrated food packs that you can carry with you, and either eat straight out of the pack or heat on the stove.


You could also pack food such as sandwiches, fruit, and other high carbohydrate foods. These may work fine if you will only need to have a snack on your hike, and won’t need to prepare any meals.

, Especially in the summer, there may be lots and lots of mosquitos and other bugs that may bite you. Therefore, you should be prepared by having an insect repellent that you can apply to any exposed skin.Be sure not to put your fingers in or around your mouth if you have applied insect repellent. Not only will it taste bad, it could possibly make you sick.

, You might have a GPS device, or maps loaded onto a smart phone, but sometimes electronics fail. Have a map of the area, and maps of the trails you will be taking just in case.Most of the more popular trails offer free guides. Enquire about this online or over the phone before your hike begins.

, You never know what will happen out on the trail, so it is good to be prepared with some of the basics. Kits are very small and light these days, so don’t worry about it taking up too much space.Make sure that your kit contains the following: bandages, gauze, moleskin (to be used on blisters), pain medication, and allergy cream.
You should also consider packing Diamox in your kit. Diamox is a medication that is commonly used to treat symptoms of altitude sickness if, for some reason, you are not able to ascend slowly (which is the best prevention for altitude sickness)., Before your hike begins, you should be well-hydrated. During your acclimation stay, you should be drinking 2 to 3 liters of water each day to prepare your body for the hike.


During the hike, keep a 1 liter bottle of water in your pack, and drink often to keep yourself hydrated. If there are stops along the way, refill your bottle, even if you think you won’t need it., At higher altitudes, your body will burn energy more quickly, so have some snacks such as dried fruit and nuts, fresh fruit, or a bag of chips to eat as a snack.


You will want the snack to be high in carbohydrates, so you can quickly replenish your lost energy.Beef jerky, chocolate, and hard candies offer good, light weight snack solutions.

, This is especially important if your hike begins at a lower altitude and increases steadily. You will notice as you hike that you begin to tire more easily, and you may feel short of breath. Take frequent breaks to recover, and go more slowly.Once you have reached an altitude above 6,000 feet (1,828 m) consider resting for a day or two to give your body some time to acclimate.

, On a long hike, it can be easy to slip into a state where you aren’t really paying much attention to how you’re feeling physically. However, when you are hiking at high altitudes, you should remain aware of what is going on with your body, especially as you ascend higher and higher.


If you begin to experience nausea, a lack of hunger, a lack of thirst, or if you notice a headache, are feeling dizzy, having trouble breathing, or losing control of your coordination, stop. Tell another member of your hiking group. Don’t ignore these symptoms, as they may be early signs of altitude sickness.Don’t try to tough it out. These symptoms may subside quickly with a bit of rest, but they could also turn into something more deadly if you aren’t careful.

, If and when you start to notice some shortness of breath, stay alert. Focus on taking deep breaths in and out, and make sure that the breaths are even. This will help you avoid over-exerting yourself.If you feel that you are over-exerting yourself, stop and take a break for a few minutes to regain control of your breathing.

, Each time you ascend another 1,000 feet above the altitude that you live in normally, you should stop and rest for 2 hours. This will give your body a chance to acclimatize, and will help you avoid dangerous consequences of ascending too quickly.This may mean taking more time than you hoped, and may mean camping over night, so be prepared for this reality.

, If you are on an overnight or multi-day hike, you should not sleep at an elevation that is more than 1,500 feet higher than the elevation at which you slept the night before.For example, if you slept at 6,000 feet the night before, you should not sleep above 7,500 feet the next night.

, With high altitude hiking, it is important that you be ready to turn around and call it quits if any of your hiking group begin to experience symptoms of altitude sickness.It may feel disappointing, but it is better to be safe than stuck on the top of a mountain with a person who is suffering from severe symptoms of altitude sickness.

Cast the line.,
Wait for a fish.,
Decide what to do with your fish.",How to Fish (for Beginners)," There are plenty of fish in the sea, but finding the right area could mean more specific catches, better catching probability, or even a friendlier community to help enjoy the trip.


For people who live on the coast, saltwater fishing is an easy pick for them. They will probably already have several poplar sites around them. Generally the most popular among them would be a great place to start as it would have the most community built around it as well as contain a probable good fish population.
For the more landlocked areas, finding a spot may just involve asking around with locals or at fishing shops of any kind. People who regularly fish tend to be very friendly and eager to show what they know to beginners.;
, After you've found a place, the timing should be accounted for as well. For example, plenty of people tend to fish around dawn or dusk as these are peak feeding times for fish.

, Localized fishing licenses are required in order to fish and take your catch home. These licenses can be obtained from local Department of Fish and Wildlife centers


However, many more private or commercial fishing areas exist where admission is charged in order to enter and fish. These such places include that permission within their cost, making them cheaper than a license for occasional trips.

, As long as the line is medium in length and flexible, it should do fine for beginners. For now, these details shouldn't concern you too much until you enjoy the sport, are familiar with it, and are ready to invest in better equipment. For now, the basics will do just fine.


Prices will vary, but getting the rod from a regular big-box retailer would probably do you much more than going to a specialty store. Try to get a bundle that comes with its own reel and tackle box as you can use these to learn which tools you want to use continuously.

, As for bait, live, fake, and dead bait are all options for you to buy. These are all fine for now as you will eventually learn how to use other tools to catch your own bait later. In addition, it is useful to get over any squeamishness on dead bait before you move on to live bait.


If you are going to be using live bait, be aware of the need to contain them in some sort of storage and keep them alive by either cycling water within the storage or using an air pump to pump oxygen back into the water. Otherwise, the bait will die in several minutes.

, Preparing your line with the appropriate bait and tools can take some time to learn as different items have different uses and knowing which to use takes some familiarity with their effects on the line.


Tying the knots in lines may require some certain special kinds of knots. A basic one that is useful to learn as well as easy is the J knot, which can be best learned with a short supplemental video tutorial search.
Sinkers, or weights, are used to give the line more inertia against currents in order to sop your hook from just floating on the surface.
Bobbers are used for visibly seeing your line and any potential bites tugging down on it.
Baiting a hook may not be the most pleasant task, but bait should usually be hooked several times for security. However, it should look natural as animals would not aim for dead looking fish and like to only bite live-looking bait.

, For both the main types of reels, the technique is the same. Both reels have a locked and released phase for its line. The general technique is to unlock the line and hold it with your fingers and then swing your rod in an arc, letting go of the line at the peak of the arc. The momentum should cause the hook (if its heavy enough) to fly. As it sinks, the line should be locked as to not let the string fall loose around the real or to let a fish just walk away with your hook.

, Patience is a well-known attribute to fishing, but is a bit exaggerated. Don't be impatient with your rod, after about leaving it for about 15 minutes, it is a good idea to take it out and recast it. It may need to be baited again, so leaving it in longer than that could be a waste of time.


Getting used to how tugs feel will take some time as smaller fish tugs may act differently, but be the same strength as the waves or the wind on your sinker or line.
When you feel a tug, your first instinct should be pull your rod upwards, pushing the hook further into the catch. This functions as to secure the hook in the fish.
Reeling in the line should not just be done with only the reel. The reel may not be strong enough to pull in the larger fish. Appropriate reeling requires the fisherman to pull back the rod and reel in the slack created by the pull. Doing this repeatedly ensures the fight to pull on the rod itself and not the small reel.

, Once a fish is caught, what to do with it is only somewhat up to you. Releasing it back is always an option, but in order to keep the catch, some further identification is required. There are size and species regulations that should be explained to you as you get your license that require you to release some fish depending on their age (determined by size) and species. If you are keeping the fish, the appropriate containers should be accounted for.

To learn about other people's experiences and opinions, ask from a knowledgeable outdoorsman or outdoorswoman. If you are new to backpacking trips, consider joining a backpacking group or tour and ask for help. You might want to learn these things below just in case something goes wrong.


How to start a fire
How to send a smoke signal
How to set up a tent
How to use a compass;
, Some popular hiking destinations require permits to use certain areas. You may need a fishing license to go trout fishing. If you fail to make a reservation for the hut at trail's end, you'll be out of luck.

, Buy a good compass and a map of the area in which you intend to immerse yourself, and study the terrain carefully before you set out, so that you have some idea of what awaits you. Get in the habit as you hike of looking around and checking your map so you always know where you are. Keep track of landmarks and trailside scenery and make notes as you go on the map. Put the map into a clear plastic bag and seal it if it is not already waterproof. This might mean that you have to cut the map up and seal each section into a separate bag, but it keeps it clean and dry. The Silva brand of compasses are normally accompanied by a pamphlet with detailed instructions.

, This is extremely important if you are going someplace very different from your own locality. Research what sort of weather to expect, what types of creatures (i.e. bears) and vegetation that you are likely to encounter, terrain, and possible dangers. A guidebook can be useful, if it is high-quality. Ask a local guide what to look for, if possible. While part of the adventure is facing the unknown, people can get themselves seriously endangered, die, or just have no fun whatsoever when they fail to plan.

, Before leaving for the hike, be sure a trusted person will be alerted to your trip. If a disaster befalls you, and you don't come back on time, he or she can alert the authorities, give information on your intended whereabouts, and so on.

, Problems can arise if there's a bad match of hikers. If you have little experience, find hikers who can help guide you. Make sure you like each other. Choose fellow hikers who have a similar or better physical fitness level. It can help if you have similar interests in the hike--wanting to identify local birds, or take wildlife photography, rock-climb, and so on. Don't randomly join hikes with people you do not know or who do not seem to understand what they are getting into; they can be a liability later.

, Temperatures and weather can vary wildly; be prepared for a range of conditions. Learn to dress warmly for cold temperatures or protect yourself from heat.

, Choose items for slim profile. Things you will need easy access to should be on outer pockets. Place heavy stuff in the bottom compartment and the lighter on top. Compress items that can be squished with plastic bags, folding, or whatever will help make it smaller. This is a fine skill and each person's pack is different.

, Two days into the back-country is notthe time to find out you aren't able to carry your own pack. Carry it around fully loaded for a few hours every day. Take walks whenever possible with it. If your backpack is too heavy and unwieldy in the middle of civilization, it will to be impossible to carry in the wilderness. Do not try to carry more than 30% of your own body weight on your back-and even that might be too much.

, Don't assume you can drink the water unless told by an expert-a crystal clear mountain stream can be swimming with illness-causing bacteria. Water may not be potable, or essentially inaccessible. In a dry or hot season, springs, rivers, and streams may dry up. In some dry areas, like deserts, you may have to bring in all of your water. Remember that water is 8 1/3 pounds a gallon. You might want to use a water purifier.

, Usually, water from a questionable source is cleaned either with a pump or with chemicals such as iodine or chlorine dioxide, both of which can be bought from a camping store or on-line. These chemicals can sometimes double as a disinfectant for wounds, insect bites and scratches.

, What you will need to bring will depend on where you are hiking, when, and how long you'll be out. But a basic kit will contain:


Bandages, both gauze and ACE bandages(for sprains and strains)
Sunscreen
Pain-killers (ibuprofen, etc.)
Tweezers
Anti-bacterial cream
Diarrhea relief
Adhesive bandages
Foot care items: athletic tape, blister bandages, ""moleskin"" patches, etc.
Anything else you tend to need: asthma inhaler, for instance.

, Always bring a headlamp or flashlight with extra batteries and bulb (if applicable). There are wind-up or pump lights that do not require batteries but they do not always provide as much light. You may want a lightweight lantern or LED light for ambient light.

, Even if you're experienced, it's far safer to travel in pairs or a group. Be sure at least one outdoorsman or outdoorswoman in your group has the experience, skills, and intelligence to keep everyone safe.

, For backpacking, you need shelter that is proper for the terrain and season, lightweight but strong, and relatively easy to manage. ""Pop-up"" tents are very popular for the beginner, although be sure to select the tent that will fit your needs.Be sure to assemble your tent before heading to the wilderness, to know how to set it, inspect for damage, and replace any missing parts. Always have a repair kit. Avoid packing wet tents if you can. If you can't, don't forget to dry them out later.

, A sleeping bag is the typical way to keep warm at night. Be sure yours is rated in the recommended temperature range of your wilderness area, as you don't want to be too hot or cold. Buy a compression bag to help reduce bulk. You may want to buy a sleeping bag liner to keep your bag in its best shape. You also will likely want a sleeping pad, either blow-up or self-inflating. All of these items will be among your heaviest, bulkiest items, so choose wisely. A zero-degree bag should not weigh more than 3 pounds if you shop carefully. A sleeping pad should not weigh more than 2 pounds. Added together and on your back, that's still a heavy 5 pounds. Try find gear well below these weights.

, A foot injury will turn a wilderness journey into a crisis in moments. Choose supportive, rugged footwear appropriate to the terrain. Hiking boots are the usual best choice, with hiking shoes or sandals also possible good choices. 'Always break in your footwear before your backpacking trip.': a simple blister can cause big difficulties. Socks are important too: be sure they cushion sufficiently and bring enough to rotate to avoid infections. If you get a ""hot spot,"" (starts to hurt a little), stop and deal with it right away. You might avoid a big problem later.

, Backpacking in the wilderness requires lightweight, shelf-stable, high-calorie food. Avoid food that needs refrigeration or is fragile. Most outdoor stores, catalogs, and websites offer freeze-dried, or ready-to-eat meals that are easy to heat. American-style MRE's (military rations) are available in a commercial version. You can also find foods at the grocery store that are in camping-friendly form. In addition to snacks, two or three meals a day, be sure you bring a bit more than you think you'll need. In bear country, you will need to have a bear-resistant container and secure it properly.

, What will you use for heating food and beverages? (If you are.)Some areas permit campfires or have grills on-site. However, some locations will not allow open fires, or there will not be enough wood. A lightweight camping stove will be useful, and is faster to cook with, especially in bad weather. Remember you will need cooking implements, vessels, and something to eat and drink with. Ultra-light setups usually focus on boiling water for freeze-dried meals; more elaborate cooking (frying, simmering, mixing multiple items for one dish) calls for less specialized (and usually heavier) cookware. Your stove and cookware should not weigh more than 2 pounds. For example, an ultralight stove = 3-6 oz, ultralight pot = 6 oz. The latest models tend to use a lot less fuel, which will also save you weight (once you know how much fuel you need... this varies according to the menu and altitude/outside temperatures)

, Campfires can be life-saving, as well as a great comfort. But they are also a leading cause of injury at campsites. Be sure that you understand basic campfire-making and safety.


Have two methods for creating fire, such as waterproof matches and a lighter.
If there is a designated area, use it.
Always have the means to extinguish a fire immediately if it gets out of control.
Never leave a fire smoldering.
If open fires are not allowed, respect that rule.
Do not burn plastic.
Never pitch your tent close to the campfire--tents are flammable and meltable!

, You will need to be able to wash any cookware and your hands prior to cooking. You will also need plastic bags (preferably zip-top) for any waste that needs to be packed out, such as wrappers or dog doo-doo.

, Be sure to dispose of your own wastes properly. Away from your campsite (in an area with some privacy), dig a hole about 12 inches (30.5 cm) deep. This is the toilet area. Food wastes, such as leftover stew, could possibly go down this hole as well. Menstruating females should take extra care with used feminine products and not bury items such as most feminine napkins and plastic tampon applicators. Cover with soil and rocks afterwards. This protects the natural environment, watersheds, and prevents other backpackers from accidentally stepping in something utterly disgusting. Note that some areas do not allow this ""cat-hole"" method and require you to carry out your waste using special ""WAG-bags"" (heavy-duty ziplock bags with cat litter and other chemicals.

, It's a hike, not a sprint. Hike slower than you think you should to conserve your energy; the general rule of thumb for speed is that you should be able to hold a conversation while walking. Take breaks every hour or so or after a difficult patch.

, Stay on the trail. Keep your hiking group together. Don't make unnecessary changes to your route. Don't wander off by yourself or take shortcuts.

, Don't leave garbage anywhere on your route; ""pack in, pack out"". Don't uproot local vegetation, rocks, or any natural feature. Leave the wilderness as pristine (or better) than you found it.

Pack 1 to 2 lbs.,
Choose easy-to-prepare, filling foods for breakfast.,
Pack carbohydrate-heavy foods for lunch.,
Select hearty, calorie-rich food for dinner.,
Pack snacks with sugar and fat content.,
Remove food from its original packaging and repack it more efficiently.,
Avoid water-heavy foods.,
Avoid perishable items.

",How to Prepare Backpacking Food," (or 1/2 to 1 kg) of food for each day of your hike. This usually translates to roughly 3000-4000 calories per day.;
,


Instant oatmeal or potatoes are good choices because they cook quickly and are very light. Powdered whole milk is a good way to add more calories. Dried fruit is also an efficient breakfast addition. If you want a hot beverage, pack instant coffee or tea.







,


Because of the energy you will expend hiking, you need to eat lots of carbohydrates every day. Loaves of bread tend to get squished in a backpack, so try crackers, tortillas or pita bread instead. It's helpful to eat carbohydrates in the middle of the day when you need the most energy and can burn them off before going to sleep.






Pair your crackers or tortillas with foods rich in protein and fat, like nut butter, salami and cheese, to keep you feeling full longer.

,


Instant noodles, dried meats, and cheese are popular backpacking dinners. Do not pack anything that takes more than 10 minutes to cook so as to save fuel.







,


Snacks should provide extra energy during the day. Typical backpacking snacks include energy bars and trail mix (usually made with nuts, dried fruit, and chocolate).







,


Most store-bought food will come in cumbersome packaging that will make your backpack heavier and will be hard to dispose of on the trail. Take foods like oatmeal, noodles, and coffee out of their packaging and repack it in small, easy to seal plastic bags.







,


Fresh fruits and vegetables, while healthy, have a very inefficient calorie-to-weight ratio. Do not plan on packing more than one fruit or vegetable for each day of your trip. Lightweight food that has been dehydrated is best for backpacking.

Clean the trap.,
Consider dyeing the trap.,
Separate the jaws.,
Insert a bar through the chain.,
Select the wax.,
Melt the wax.,
Submerge the trap in the wax.,
Slowly remove the trap.,
Allow the trap to dry.,
Store carefully until use.",How to Wax Traps," Before waxing a trap, you should make sure that it is free from grease, blood, dirt, rust, and other contaminants.


Scrub away contaminants using soap and hot water. Rinse well before proceeding further.
For rusty or extremely grungy traps, allow them to soak in undiluted vinegar for several hours. Scrub away any remaining rust with a steel wire brush.
Allow the trap to dry outside for approximately one week. A light coating of rust should form on the surface of the trap.;
, Dyeing is another procedure used to protect traps. If you choose to dye and wax the trap, you must dye the trap before coating it with wax.Place a heat-resistant brick inside the dye pot to prevent the trap from touching the bottom of the pot. The springs of the trap may weaken if directly exposed to the heat.
Mix 1 lb (450 g) of logwood dye into 3 to 5 gallons (12 to 20 L) of water. Bring the dye mixture to a rolling boil over a burner, then reduce the heat so that the dye drops to a mild simmer.
Lower the trap into the dye and allow it to stay in the simmer liquid for one hour.
Remove the trap and allow it to dry completely before waxing it.

, Carefully place a nail in between the jaws of the trap to keep them open throughout the waxing process.This step will allow the wax to coat the inside of the trap, thereby protecting it more thoroughly.
Another option is to wax the trap once it is already set so that all parts will be submerged. Doing this can be rather dangerous, however, since triggering the spring can cause the trap to close without warning and injure you.

, Insert a thin, sturdy piece of metal rebar through the chain of the trap. This bar must be able to support the weight of the trap without assistance.


Select a piece of rebar that is longer than the mouth of the pot you plan to use for waxing. The bar will need to rest on top of the pot without slipping in.
You may need to readjust the position of the rebar later, but for now, position it somewhere within the top few links of the chain.

, Odorless trap wax is the best option to use and is specifically manufactured for this purpose.


The next best option is refined trapping beeswax. When using this, you should also add an equal amount of paraffin wax to the melting pot to help regulate the temperature.
Unscented paraffin wax can be used alone, as well, but keep in mind that it has a lower boiling point than most trap waxes.
Do not use straight beeswax without adding paraffin wax. Beeswax is brittle and will likely dry unevenly when used alone.

, Place 5 lbs (2250 g) of wax into a small pot with tall sides. Heat the wax in a deep fryer until it is completely melted.Do not add any water to the wax. The wax will actually stick to the trap more effectively without the addition of water.
If you do not have a deep fryer that can be used for waxing traps, place the wax in a small pot with deep sides and melt it over an open flame. Temperature is easier to control with a deep fryer, but an open flame will still work.
Keep the wax in a liquid state throughout the entire process, but do not allow the wax to get much hotter than that. Wax can burst into flames if it becomes too hot.

, Slowly submerge the prepared trap into the melted wax. Allow it to remain in the wax for several minutes.


The metal of the trap must have ample opportunity to heat up. If it does not get hot enough, the wax may not dry smoothly or evenly.
Hold the rebar as you lower the trap into the wax. If you do not want to hold the trap as it sits in the wax, carefully rest the rebar on the mouth of the pot.
Do not allow the trap to rest on the bottom of the pot. The springs can become damaged if they touch the bottom of the hot melting pot.

, Pick up the rebar attached to the trap chain and carefully lift the trap out of the hot wax. Hold it above the pot for several seconds to allow the excess liquid wax to drip off the wax and back into the melting pot.


If the metal trap reached hot enough temperatures, the excess wax should drop off the trap and look as clear and fluid as water.

, Hang the trap outside for several hours. The wax should cool and dry completely before you handle it any further.


Do not hang the trap in an area polluted by strong odors.
The wax should dry as a light, even coating. If the wax is chunky or thick when it dries, you may have removed the traps too soon.

, Store the traps in plastic containers until you plan to use them.


Surround the traps with several layers of local leaves or branches. Doing so will imbed the wax with a natural odor, making it less noticeable to wildlife once set.
Handle the traps while wearing gloves to prevent your scent from seeping into the wax.

Learn to evaluate and manage avalanche hazard.,
Learn seasonally appropriate emergency skills.,
Pack seasonally appropriate supplies and, most importantly of all, know how to use them.,
Let somebody know where you're going, which route you intend to take, and when you'll be back.,
Pay attention to your gut; if the weather looks like it's turning bad, you'd do better to turn back and hike again later, instead of getting caught out in a storm.

",How to Prepare for a Winter Hike,"


Wear a wicking, snug-fitting under-layer to help keep you dry and warm.






Add 1 or 2 layers of insulating fleece, wool or synthetic materials. Avoid cotton, which gets wet and stays wet against your skin, robbing your body of heat.






Finish with a windproof, waterproof and breathable--or at least wind- and water-resistant--outer layer of both pants and jacket.






Don't forget to don warm gloves and socks that are loose enough to allow adequate circulation in your fingers and toes. You can layer your gloves and socks just like you layer the rest of your body, but try to limit yourself to about 2--or in extreme conditions, 3--layers.






Add a warm, insulated hat and an extra windproof, waterproof head layer--the hood on your jacket will do for the latter.






Sturdy, insulated shoes help keep your feet warm. Avoid wearing tennis shoes during a winter hike; the shoes will just turn into a soggy, squishy mess full of melted snow.

Choose the right rod.,
Choose the right reel.,
Think heavy line – repeat, HEAVY line.,
Spread out the arms.,
Put a jig head on each arm.,
Tip each jig head with a twist-tail grub or worm.,
Look for suitable underwater structure.,
Heave the chandelier.,
Let the rig settle to the desired depth.,
Retrieve the umbrella rig with an interrupted steady retrieve.",How to Fish an Umbrella Rig for Bass," Because the umbrella rig is so heavy, you need a medium heavy to heavy action rod to handle its weight. Many anglers prefer rods between 7 and 8 feet (2.1 to 2.4m) in length with graphite blanks.You need the additional length and stout action to heave the weight of the chandelier rig and attached lures, which can be as much as 4 ounces (1/4 pound, 113.4g), in repeated casts. Too short a rod or too spongy an action, and you’ll tire yourself out quickly.;
, Many anglers prefer to use baitcasting reels when fishing the Alabama rig, as those reels are designed to fish with the heavy lines the rig makes necessary. If you prefer a baitcasting reel, get one with a retrieve ratio of at least 5.5 to 1, or better yet, 6.5 to 1, with ball-bearing and designed to be taken apart easily when you need to clean it and a braking system to minimize backlashes. If you prefer a spinning reel, choose one designed to handle heavy line. You almost want a reel designed for saltwater fishing, but not quite.

, The umbrella rig is not meant for ultralight fishing, by any means, and the line you spool your reel with needs to be heavier than what you’d use when fishing with one lure at a time.


For a baitcasting reel, choose a braided line of 65 to 80-pound test (30 to 36kg class). Inventor Andy Poss recommends using 100-pound test (50kg class)!For a spinning reel, use a monofilament line of the same test or class.

, While you need to keep the arms close together when storing an Alabama rig in your tackle box, when fishing it, the arms should be spread out. Allow enough distance to keep the lures attached to the arms from getting caught on one another but not so far apart as to be easily caught on rocks or stumps.


A tight configuration also more naturally simulates the way a group of baitfish swim., If you plan to fish the Alabama rig in relatively open water, you can use round jig heads. If you plan to fish the Alabama jig in weeds or brush, use either jig heads with weed guards or heads designed to be fished self-weedless (inserted into the body of the plastic worm or grub they’re baited with).


You don’t have to use all heads of the same weight. You can put the lightest heads, such as 1/8 ounce (3.55g). at the top, the next heaviest, such as 1/4 ounce (7.09g), at the bottom, and the heaviest, such as 1/2 ounce (14.17g), in the middle. This will give the illusion of a small school of baitfish of different sizes. Often, fish will strike at the jig in the center of the rig.Attach the jigheads to the arms with either the snaps attached to the ends or with split rings. Don’t use leaders, as the added length will cause the jigs to foul around one another during the cast or retrieve., Grubs or worms from 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) in length with a ribbon or sickle tail will flutter when retrieved, creating the illusion of swimming baitfish.The tail should be placed so that it curves downward.


Where possible, choose colors that match the food fish where you fish. If that’s not possible, you can fall back on the “bright day, bright color; dark day, dark color” rule.
If the water is particularly dark, you may want to substitute a spinnerbait for the center jig/grub combination.

, With the help of an electronic depth sounder, you can find underwater ledges and drop-offs, preferably with cover such as stumps, weeds, or gravel. Once you’ve established the general lay of the submerged land, you can mark your targets with small buoys.

, A flick of the wrist just won’t do when casting an umbrella rig. You need to put your shoulder, your forearm, and your upper body into the cast to get the rig and its attached lures out there.


If you’re using a rod with a long handle, you can use your trailing hand (your left hand if you normally cast right-handed or your right hand if you cast left-handed) to whip the handle back as you use your leading hand to whip the rest of the rod forward.

, Generally, lures will fall 1 foot (30cm) per second. You can count seconds by saying “1001, 1002,” etc. until the lure reaches the right depth.

, Reel the rig in slowly for 10 to 15 seconds, then pause for a second before resuming the retrieve. Fish will often strike one or more of the lures when they briefly change direction.


You may also get strikes when the rig starts to rise at the moment you’re finishing your retrieve.If the speed of your retrieve doesn’t work, try increasing or decreasing it.

If you are selecting a backpack for camping, it is good to look for a framed pack with additional straps for comfort. Look for padding on the sides to protect your back from chafing. A good camping bag should have many easily accessible pockets.
If you are looking for a sports backpack, look for a light bag which is reasonably sturdy and compact. Make sure that you can fit your equipment.;

Listen to turkeys.,
Buy a box call.,
Chalk it up.,
Try a yelp.,
Gobble and cackle.",How to Use a Turkey Call1," Before you start making calls of your own, you need a solid handle on what turkey calls sound like. You can’t imitate what you don’t understand.Find recordings of different turkey sounds, or better yet, sit down in the forest and listen to them.


Recognize that turkeys are social animals'; they travel in groups and make noises to communicate. Your turkey calls will be best if you think of them as language, not just noise.
A variety of turkey calls can gain turkey's attention, pull or push them in certain directions, and either soothe or scare them.;
, This type of call is popular and reliable, and is well-known for being the easiest to learn for novices. Because it is so easy to use, you can start using the box call as you develop an ear for sounds. Experimenting with it will help you differentiate between the calls, and what it takes in terms of pressure, friction, and duration to produce them.Box calls can be purchased over the Internet, but many like to buy them in person, so they can test them beforehand. You can get a solid one for around $15 (USD), but many cost $30 or more.
Wooden box calls have been around for over a century. There are many types of wood available, all valuable for their versatility and timbre.Aluminum box calls are also useful, as they last longer in wet weather., Before you practice with your box call or set out to hunt with it, rub down the moving surfaces with a wax-free chalk. (This should be available where you purchase your other hunting supplies.)It’s a good idea to do this at least once during your hunting session, as well.

, Yelps are some of the most well-known turkey calls, so they’re a good one to master. Slide the lid of the box, across the open box with pressure to create friction. Swing it smoothly to create a full sound--don’t stop in the middle.This sound imitates the noise a turkey makes when trying to reconnect with its flock.Hold the paddle gently instead of pulling it firmly.You can vary the sound of the yelp by changing the speed and friction you use.
Yelps are a good basic, but not the end-all be-all of turkey calls. Don’t rest on your laurels once you’ve mastered this sound--keep learning new ones., Hold the box call vertically (so that its long end is perpendicular to the forest floor). Now, shake it vigorously so that the lid clatters against the box. Do this a bit more slowly to make a gobble (a noise meant to attract female turkeys and challenge tom turkeys). Moving more quickly will produce a cackle (which turkeys use to communicate their locations to one another).Use this call to provoke the turkey to gobble in response, thus give away its location.
As you do this, don’t move around too much. Because the box call requires physical activity, the motion can easily spook the birds if they are nearby.

Purchase a few slate calls.,
Yelp with the striker.,
Learn clucks, putts, and cutts.,
Use the slate to purr.,
Sand your slate call.",How to Use a Turkey Call2," Opt for the slate call if you want something a little more challenging; this is a favorite among the experts. Like box calls, they are percussive, and consist of two parts: the call itself, a flat circle made of slate, glass, or another material, and strikers, sticks shaped like screwdrivers.You may also hear them referred to as pot-and-peg calls; this is correct as well.
Each combination of striker and slate makes a different sound as you rub the striker on the slate, so get a few and experiment., Now that you have your slate call, learn the basic: the yelp. The pitch and volume of this will sound different depending on which slate and striker you use, so it’s good to practice with a variety of tools. Experiment to discover what works best for you.


To get the basic motion of using a slate call, press the striker firmly to the slate, then quickly circle the striker around it.
To improve the yelp, try drawing a fish-hook shape with the striker (instead of a circle shape). This will produce a “ye-OW” sound, which is even more accurate., These very different sounds start with a similar motion--all you need to do to change the meaning is vary the speed and pressure of the movement. To cluck, putt, or cut, pull the striker horizontally and sharply on the slate.


Clucking is the most relaxed of the three--it’s a turkey’s way of telling other turkeys where it is.Because it’s a slow call, your movement should be, too.
Putting is an alarm sound, so if you’re trying to attract turkeys, it’s to be avoided. If you’re a wildlife photographer who wants to photograph them on the move, it’s perfect. Make the same motion, but do it with more force and rhythm.Cutting is mostly quick clucking, with a few yelps. It’s the noise a hen makes when she’s in the mood, so it’s popular for attracting toms., How is a turkey at peace like a cat at peace? They both like to purr. To make this contented sound, drag the striker vertically and slowly across the slate with some pressure. Unlike many well-known turkey calls, this should be a soft and comforting noise, not a sharp one., If you want slate calls and strikers so sound their best, then periodically, you will need to remove grime from their surfaces. If you’re working with a slate call made of actual slate, then a gentle application of fine-grit sandpaper is the best way to get the job done. Rub it down with the sandpaper at the end of the season, and any time you notice a visible buildup of grime.Store slate calls in a sealed plastic bag off-season, in a spot with stable temperature and humidity.
Never touch the surface of your slate call with your hands! This will make it oily, marring the sound.

Buy a single or double-reed diaphragm call.,
Practice moving your mouth.,
Trim the call to fit your mouth.,
Begin yelping.,
Cackle and cutt.,
Practice purrs.",How to Use a Turkey Call3," Diaphragm calls, or mouth calls, are tricky to use, but their range makes them popular with turkey hunters anyway. Unlike box and slate calls, they aren’t held in your hands. Instead, a mouth call is a rubber or latex organ that fits in the mouth, up against the palate.


Single-reed calls have the best range: you can make a wide variety of noises, and make those noises carry farther, with them. However, they’re hard to learn.Double-reed calls are a bit more limited, but they’re much easier to use., Since mouth calls don’t require the use of your hands, they’re convenient, but require learning a different set of motions. Find a quiet place where you won’t be interrupted, and get your mouth used to the way it feels to have the call inside it. Here are some exercises you should try.


Start by placing the call in your mouth. Keep the open end facing outside, then push the call up to the roof of your mouth with your tongue.
Exhale so that the air is forced between your tongue and the call.
Press your tongue hard against the reed, then blow. You will produce a higher sound this way.
Now press more gently. With low pressure, the sounds will be lower tones.
Exhale syllables, such as ""chuck"" or “pip,” between tongue and reed. This will help you hear the distinct sounds they produce.

, Now that you’ve gotten the idea of how it feels to manipulate the call, you’ll want to ensure a custom fit. If it feels a little too large in your mouth, carefully trim along the edge with clean scissors, then pop it back in to check the fit.Remember to trim conservatively--you can always cut more if you need to.

, The classic yelp isn’t hard to do with a mouth call. Try saying the word “chuck” repeatedly. Experiment with different volumes and pitches to mix it up, and remember: a yelp is the first call you’ll learn on the mouth call, but not the only one., Toms are usually the ones who cackle (or gobble), while hens are the chief cutters. There may be a sex difference in the way these sounds are deployed, but the motion for each is the same. Simply place your call in your mouth, and say “kit kit kit” several times.Make the sound quicker for cackling. Try listening to recorded cackles and gobbles until you feel you can get it right.
Slow the sound down a bit to cut.

, Purring is especially tricky on the mouth call. Some mouth call users prefer fluttering their lips around the call (as if they're blowing a raspberry), while others roll a syllable in the back of their throat (as if they're gargling). Experiment to figure out which works best for you."

Use a solar lantern to provide light.,
For hiking trips, get a solar-powered backpack.,
Get some portable solar panels.,
Try a solar light Sun jar for a mellow light at night.,
Have a solar powered camping shower.",How to Use Solar Energy While Camping," The K-Light Solar Lantern, made by Pisat, is the same size and weight as a full can of soda and has two output settings—one that uses 16 LEDs or the economy mode that uses 8 LEDs. It is charged through a separate solar panel and the higher output provides one hour of light for each hour of charge. In the lower mode, it provides two hours of use for one hour of charge.;
, Having a backpack that is solar powered means you can charge up a laptop computer or cell phone while you are far into the woods with no outlet in sight. Most come with a lithium polymer battery that is built into a detachable solar panel that is placed in the backpack. A USB output comes with the battery so you can plug in whatever cord came with your device to have it charge through your backpack.

, Portable solar panels are an easy and packable way to harness the sun’s rays while camping. These panels, made by Sunlinq, are available in mats and are as thin as a blanket or even notebook paper. You can roll them up and put them in a tube or fold them and throw them in with your camping gear. There is a bit of rigidity to the panels so you can bend them a bit to adjust to the direction of the sun. They just need to be placed on top of your car or RV or even on the ground to gather the energy that will be used later in the day.

, This handy gadget is perfect for those nights when everyone is hanging around the campground and they want some mood lighting but there is no outlet available. You set the Sun jar, which looks like a sun jar to make sun tea, anywhere outside in direct sunlight so it can collect light all day. After time, the battery charges itself and the sun jar gives off a nice muted yellow-orange light. The jar has a frosted surface that allows it to diffuse glare-free lighting.

, A solar power camping shower provides a relaxing hot shower at the end of a long day. All you need is a consistent day of sunshine and the bag containing the water will heat up and since it is black, it will absorb the most amount of light. That light, once absorbed, turns into heat and that heat is transferred to the water. It will continue to heat up as long as the sun is shining on it but it still keeps the water warm even after the sun has stopped shining on it. It’s a nice luxury to have when there is no heating source for a hot or warm shower while on the camping grounds.

You should also make sure that you have at least one person in your group that you can talk to. This will ensure that you don't feel isolated during the expedition, and you'll also know that there are people willing to support you.;
, Be sure that you take each item on the list. If your teacher hasn't given you one, ask for one. It should include clothes, waterproof clothing, a 65-litre rucksack, a roll mat and sleeping bag, a First Aid kit, some personal belongings, safety equipment, and food. An audio book on a simple MP3 player could provide encouragement and relaxation. However, check with your expedition leader, as MP3 players may be banned. Avoid carrying unnecessary objects, such as makeup or books. These items will only weigh you down or hinder you from being able to bring essential items.

, Food containing carbohydrates, such as pasta and noodles, are a great source of energy. They not only boost your health but also provide your body with the necessary nutrition to properly function. When participating in the expedition, it is important to maintain your energy levels by eating the wholesome meals provided.


Although sweets may be tempting to eat, they will only hinder you from being focused and alert. The sugar may provide a temporary high, but it will soon leave you more tired than before. Instead, opt for healthy snacks, such as dried fruit, nuts, rice cakes, and cereal bars. Sweets can be saved for checkpoints along the route instead of using them as energy. You could also use them as a reward once you have set up your tent.

, In order to ensure that your feet feel comfortable in them, wear them around the house for periods of time. You could also use an old pair. The goal is to grow accustomed to moving around in your walking boots, which helps you avoid blisters or sore feet. Additionally, get used to the weight of your rucksack before you leave. If you're unfit, the time to start exercising is six to twelve weeks before the expedition, not two days before.

, It allows you to carry small, useful items, such as blister plasters and a water bottle. You'll also have them within easy reach rather than having to stop and rummage through your rucksack. Bum bags are sold in stores or online.

, They are not only appropriate for outdoor wear but also allow you to keep small, useful items in the pockets. Walking trousers tend to be the best as they are adaptable and dry quickly. However, cargo trousers, tracksuit bottoms, or even leggings are acceptable. If you will be walking in long grass, woodland or near nettles, shorts are not a good idea.

, Before you leave, note the temperatures for the next few days, but don't believe every prediction. Despite what the forecast might say, be prepared for both rain and sunshine. Bring an umbrella and sunscreen in case, as the weather can be unpredictable at times.

, Make sure it contains plasters, a few bandages, antiseptic cream, and painkillers. Also, include a few needles and a roll of thread, which acts as a sewing kit. Check that everything is within the expiry date. You should also make sure that you are familiar with using each item in your kit.

, You may need to bring an extra outfit or two, depending on what level you're participating in. You should also have at least one spare set of clothes to wear in case the others become wet or dirtied.

, You may also want to obtain a pair of waterproof trousers and gaiters. Test the clothes beforehand by going in the shower with them on or asking a younger sibling to attack you with a hosepipe.

, Coloured bags can help you organise your bag, ensuring that you are aware of each item's location. They're useful for everything. A pocket tool or a small pocket knife is also handy.

, In order to ensure that you and your group has a good experience with the expedition, be sure that you are responsible in bringing expected items. Also, check that the rest of your group members have their items. This will show that you are both responsible and considerate.

, Be sure that you are aware of the start of the expedition, as well as the time that you are to return home. Also, you should check the location of the expedition. Print out a map if necessary.

, Make sure that you are familiar with your group. Also, you should know the number of members travelling with you, as well as their names. Once in a while, you should check to make sure that everyone is still with you. You could also assign people to travel both in the front and the back of the group, ensuring that no one gets lost or distracted from the path. If your expedition leader finds out that your group has split up at any point, you automatically fail.

, In order to have a good experience during the expedition, avoid breaking your leaders or campsite's rules. They are there to ensure that you remain safe while having fun during the expedition.

, If you are in a group of six, save time by splitting them up to compete different tasks. Organize two people to cook while the others set up the tent. Be sure that each member has the opportunity to contribute an idea before you all make the final decision.

, Rather than looking out for yourself, do your best to help others out. Be sure that each member's needs are met in order to avoid having the group collapse. You should also make sure that the tasks are equally divided so that each member can participate in the expedition. Additionally, when solving problems, ensure that all the members have the chance to contribute their ideas or thoughts.

, This will ensure that you stay warm and healthy throughout the night. Thermal base layers are excellent. Wear a warm hat, gloves, and . It's also best to have a good quality sleeping bag, 2 seasons at a minimum.

, Regularly check on your group members' condition to see if they can continue travelling. If you notice that one of them is lagging behind, offer him help by spreading some of the weight in his bag to you and the rest of the group. Be sure that each member's needs are met, especially when it comes to his health. It won't help your group if you ignore them or become cross.


If you notice that more than one member appears exhausted or has trouble continuing, you may need to stop the group for a short rest.

, Separating the group often causes more trouble. However, if the need arises, send a few people ahead. Supply them with a first aid kit, a map, a compass, your map reference, and a mobile. Never wander off alone; instead, remain with a partner so that you are not alone if trouble arises.


If your group has to separate at one point, be sure that all members are aware of where they'll be heading. Point out the locations on the map so that people know where you are.

, Make sure that you follow all the rules. Clearly display your excellent teamwork, especially when the assessor is around. You should also regularly stop to check your current location on the map while making sure everyone sees. The assessor could ask anyone in your group to show him where you all are.

, Be sure that you keep your members' spirits high by offering encouragement and help if necessary. You should also spend some time with each member to find out more information about him while ensuring that he feels involved in the group. Talking to the members could also give you an idea of their strengths and weaknesses, as well as what task they would be best suited for during the expedition.


Offer sweets at checkpoints. Using small rewards as positive reinforcements will encourage the group to continue the expedition.
Avoid whining and moaning. Although you may feel stressed or tired, having a negative attitude will only lower your group's morale. Instead, stay positive and find the best in every situation.

Plan to clean the fish within an hour or two of catching it.,
Set up a table outdoors and cover it with newspaper.,
Gather your supplies before you begin.",How to Clean/Gut a Fish1," Fish spoil rapidly after they die, so have a plan in place to clean them as soon as you're off the boat. Keep them alive in the water on a string until your fishing expedition is over, and ice them down in a cooler when it's time to pack up for the day.


Keep the fish wet until you scale them. If they have dried out, soak them a few minutes in ice water before scaling to make the scales easier to remove.
If you're buying a whole fish from the market, clean it as soon as you get home, rather than storing it in the refrigerator. You should also plan to eat it the same day you buy it.;
, Try to find a table high enough to work comfortably on, that can be rinsed easily with a garden hose when you are finished.


Avoid setting up your cleaning station indoors. Cleaning and gutting a fish is a messy job, and you won't want to clean scales or skin off your kitchen counter tops, sink, and walls when you are finished.
Many marinas and other fishing areas have cleaning stations set up for this purpose. Know ahead of time whether you'll have access to one, and make sure it has running water.

, Set out a bucket for the fish parts, gloves if you want to wear them, a sharp cutting knife, and a container for the cleaned fish. If you have a lot of fish to clean, set out a cooler full of ice to keep the cleaned fish cold.


If your fish has scales, you'll need a butter knife or a scaling tool; either one works just as well.
If your fish does not have scales, you'll need a pair of pliers, or something sharp, to peel the skin off of the fish.

Keep the strokes of your scaler short and quick. Avoid pressing too hard and gashing the fish.
Work carefully around the fins, since they can prick or puncture your skin.
Be sure to remove all of the scales from both sides of the fish. Don't forget the scales around the pectoral and dorsal fins, and up to the throat, which is the edge of the fish's gills.

An example of a great setup in this class would be a 7’ heavy fast St. Croix Avid Inshore spinning rod paired up with a Shimano Saragosa 8000 spooled with 50 pound test Jerry Brown solid core braid., For targeting smaller fish, a light tackle setup is a valuable asset. Fish like whiting will not put up much of a battle on your medium or heavy outfits, but on a quality light power outfit, they just may become one of your favorite gamefish. Start with a 7’ spinning rod with a light power rating, and pair it with a reel rated to hold around 150 yards of 4 pound monofilament line. When that’s all said and done, spool the reel with a quality 10 pound test braided line. An example of a great setup in this class would be a 7’ light fast St. Croix Avid Inshore spinning rod, paired with a Shimano Stradic 1000 and spooled with 10 pound test Jerry Brown solid core braid., These baits are usually used to target fish such as tarpon, bull jacks, and cobia. The most versatile baits are probably 7” and 10” Hogy Eels - pick up a pack of each of these sizes in a black and white pattern. Use the 10” size when targeting tarpon, and the 7” size for cobia and large jacks. While these can be rigged any way, two ways are the most productive - on a weighted weedless hook for pitching to fish that “suddenly” appear, and on a 1-3 ounce Jighead when blindly jigging for species like cobia. Hogy offers all of the terminal tackle needed to do this with.

Another great large plastic is the Gulp! Eel. You can buy a pack of these in any color you prefer, as they will all generally work the same. These are best rigged with a 6/0 circle hook through the nose. To fish these, keep one rigged on a heavy rod to pitch at cobia who are passing by or suddenly appear by the boat.

, DOA baits are some of the best soft plastic baits you can have. For trout, red drum, flounder, and a multitude of other species, start by stocking up on their pre-rigged 3” shrimp. There are five colors that can be considered “essentials” in this bait - clear/red flake, near clear/gold flake, glow, white, and chartreuse. These can be fished on their own, Carolina rigged, or under a popping cork (discussed later in this article).

For larger fish like tarpon and cobia, DOA Bait Busters and Swimming Mullet are good to have. Nearly any color will work, but many have had the best success with the silver/black back colors.
There are two other baits by DOA to consider stocking up on. First are their shad tails - these work well in natural colors and are best used when rigged on a jighead. Second is the CAL Jerkbait - this is a soft plastic jerkbait that will work well on a jighead, but is best used when fished weightless on an EWG-style worm hook, such as the type used for bass. Gamakatsu is a great brand for these hooks. Both of these baits are used on a medium setup when targeting fish in the 1 to 20 pound class.

, Baits as well. Their 3” shrimp in natural, molting, and new penny is a killer bait for everything that swims, as is their 3” swimming mullet in white and chartreuse. These are best fished on a jighead or under a popping cork, for medium-sized inshore fish., A “secret” lure to have on hand is something known as a “shrimpy jig” - everybody has their own name for these lures, but the basic setup is a 1 to 3 ounce jighead with a plastic shrimp on the end, which has twin curly tails on it. Keep some in white and in chartreuse, and they are great for catching cobia., These are good to have on hand. These are best fished during the winter on a jighead for medium-sized fish. Two good brands are Gotcha and Z-Man. A favorite color is clear, with many colorful flakes in it - such as red, blue, green, and silver. Chartreuse and orange grubs also work well., There are three brands of topwater plugs that work extremely well for these fish - Heddon Super Spook Jr’s, Rapala Skitterwalks, and Bomber Badonkadonks. These are best fished with a walk-the-dog retrieve, and the best colors are any that have some orange on the belly of them. These are said to imitate dying baitfish, and they tend to work extremely well., If you are ever in a tackle shop or a store that sells any fishing tackle, check the bargain bin. If they have any large topwater plugs in there, buy some of them, and use them for jacks. The reason for this is that jacks will hit a topwater bait very hard, and often times scratch it up, chip the paint, or even break the bait entirely, and you don’t want to waste your expensive plugs on them., These are another great type of hard bait when fishing for medium-sized fish. Good examples include the Bomber Long A, Mirrolure Mirrodine, and the Mirrolure 52M. Try to select colors that imitate local baitfish in your area., Spro bucktail jigs have become a staple in the tackle boxes of most cobia fishermen. However, when you pick up some larger ones for cobia, make sure you get some smaller ones as well - these work very well for flounder., These are long rigs which usually have six to ten droppers on them, which each have a small gold hook and a piece of mylar on them. These attract small fish to bite, and all you have to do is drop the rig to the bottom, let it sit for a while, and then bring it up - hopefully you will have caught some bait fish on it in the process., As far as live baits go, you have a lot of choices that you can make. However, individual choices will be discussed in the section where gamefish are discussed - so that you can target the specific fish you want to catch., For fishing with plastic eels, you will want 6/0 circle hooks, as well as an assortment of 1-3 ounce jigheads and weedless weighted hooks from Hogy. You will want an assortment of smaller jigheads as well, for fishing smaller plastic baits. A good go-to are Strike King saltwater jigheads in red. These are good for all DOA, Gulp!, and Gotcha plastics - you should carry some in 1/16 ounce, ⅛ ounce, and ¼ ounce. For fishing with Z-Man plastics, you will need to buy some jigheads from Z-Man that are specially designed for them (get them in the same specifications as the Strike King ones). For fishing with any small plastic baits, jigheads made by Slayer are good. Finally, you will want some Gamakatsu EWG worm hooks for fishing with DOA’s soft plastic jerkbaits - 3/0 is a good size for this., To keep it simple, there are six rigs that should be used. These are designed to target small, medium, and large fish in the top, middle, and bottom of the water column., Start by placing a small orange egg-shaped float on your main line. Now below this float, place a large split shot - something like a size 2 or 3 will work great. Directly below this weight, you will want to tie a very small swivel - preference goes towards AFW’s Mighty Mini swivels, as they are exceptionally strong and affordable in a very small size. At the other end of this swivel, tie on a length of 15 pound test monofilament - you should start with about 36”, but if you need to fish deeper or shallower, you can adjust. At the end of this, tie on a hook - many angler's preference is a size 2 circle hook (that is a #2, NOT a 2/0), however many people also use a #4 aberdeen or J-hook without much trouble., One thing with this, is don’t make the leader length any longer than 36”. You don’t want your bait flowing too far up., Next, slide a ¼ ounce egg sinker onto your mainline. After this, tie on a swivel (again, AFW Mighty Mini) directly below the weight. Tie a length of 30 pound test monofilament below your swivel - you should start with about 36” and go longer if you need to. On the end of your leader, tie a hook. The best all-around hook for this is a 1/0 kahle hook., ¼ ounce is usually enough, however if there is a strong current you can go up to ½ ounce. Afterwards tie on a swivel, and then 36” of 30 pound test monofilament leader. At the end, finish the rig up with a 1/0 kahle hook., This is usually used for free-lining live or dead baitfish - as such, the amount of terminal tackle in the rig should remain minimal. You should use 10’ of 80 pound test monofilament, tied directly to the mainline (no swivel), with an 8/0 circle hook tied onto the end with a snell knot. There are a few times when you should modify this rig - if you're fishing in areas with heavy current, try putting a size 2 or 3 split shot above the hook, to help hold the bait near the bottom. When you see fish making commotion on the surface, attach a large orange egg float about 10’ above the hook. This keeps the bait above the bottom of the water, in the likely spot where the fish are feeding. The other time you should use a float is when you are using a live fish - place the same float 6’ above the hook so that you can keep track of where the fish is swimming., The entire rig should be about 24-30” in length. One end has a swivel with a length of 80 pound mono tied to it. Thread on a single crimp, an orange bead, a 4 ounce egg sinker, another orange bead, and then another crimp. Close these crimps, so that your egg sinker stays in place. There should be about 12-18” between the sinker and the hook on this rig. Finish this rig off with an 8/0 circle hook, attached with a snell knot., Depending on where you live, these include:, They are medium-sized fish that have gray tops, silver sides, and a white belly. They have heavy-set bodies with a large jaw, and their sides feature long dark stripes. These fish are usually found from about 5 to 20 pounds, and fish up to 50 pounds or so are sometimes caught. They have a great taste, and are very hard fighters. Try to fish a live bait rig with either a menhaden or an eel, or a subsurface plug for striped bass., They are medium-sized fish which have blue sides that gradually get whiter as they go down - the whole body has a bit of a silvery tinge to it. At the base of their pectoral fin, they typically have a large dark spot. They have a large mouth full of large sharp teeth, and a heavily forked tail. They are usually caught from less than one pound all the way up to 10-12 pounds, although from Maine to about North Carolina, they are occasionally seen up to about 20 pounds. Small bluefish taste good, although they should be directly bled and put on ice, and eaten the same day they were caught. Bluefish are some of the hardest-fighting fish to be caught inshore. A favorite way to catch them is with a topwater lure, preferably one of the “bargain bin” ones., These are small to medium-sized fish which are gray on top and silver on the sides and bottom - although the color can vary based on the fish’s surroundings. They have prominent canine teeth in their mouth, and their sides feature tiny black spots arranged in diagonal lines. They are usually caught at about 2 or 3 pounds in weight, but fish up to 6 pounds or so are occasionally caught. They taste pretty good, and on light tackle they are pretty fun to catch. Try to use a live bait rig with a menhaden or croaker, or a jig - either a bucktail, or a jighead with a soft plastic trailer., Juveniles have white or gray sides with black vertical stripes, while adults are a solid brownish-black color. Black drum of all sizes have barbels on the chin. Juveniles are normally caught from 1 to 10 pounds, however larger adults are often caught up to 50 pounds. Occasionally, fish up to about 80 pounds are found and caught. Drum under 10 pounds taste very good, but larger ones not so much. They fight hard, although this is mostly due to their size. Artificials don’t work well for them - a preferred method is an appropriately-sized bottom rig with a blue crab or a large shrimp on it., Flounder have both eyes on either the left or the right side of their face, and are considered flatfish. Their descriptions vary by species, but generally they are brownish in color with or without spots, although their color changes based on the bottom they are sitting on. Flounder are usually caught from about 1 to 4 pounds, although occasionally larger species are caught at 10-12 pounds. Flounder taste very good, no matter the species. Smaller flounder are only fun on light tackle, although larger flounder are usually pretty strong. Try to fish a jighead with a soft plastic trailer, however bottom rigs with live bait work very well for flounder - the best baits include killifish and mullet, but they will eat shrimp, bloodworms, or menhaden as well., Juvenile redfish are usually pink, and gradually get redder and redder - when they are adults, they are usually a bit more bronze than red. Redfish typically have a large spot at the base of the tail, and have large, thick scales. They are usually caught from about 2 to 15 pounds, although bull redfish of 30+ pounds are not too rare. Redfish under about 10 pounds taste very good, although larger ones don’t taste as good. Redfish are very strong fighters, and are capable of making very long runs. Try to fish a subsurface plug for redfish, and if that doesn’t work then go for a bottom rig with a mullet, crab, or shrimp on it., They have a large mouth with prominent canine teeth, and are usually silver in color - although like the weakfish, their color changes based on their environment. They have a lot of black spots on their sides. They are small, usually found about 1 to 3 pounds in weight - sometimes, anglers catch fish in the 4-10 pound range though. They taste pretty good, and on light tackle they fight pretty hard. Try a live bait rig with shrimp for smaller trout, but when the larger trout are around, rig up a small live perch, croaker, pigfish, or menhaden. When you feel like using an artificial, reach for a soft plastic jerkbait, a jighead with a soft plastic trailer, or a topwater plug., They are a deep, round fish with a silver color, and they have a black spot under their pectoral fin. They have large, sickle-shaped tails with no scutes. When these fish are caught, they are often founds in weights of up to 20 or 30 pounds. Small fish taste very good, but large ones don’t taste as good and should be released for other anglers to catch. Many anglers consider permit the toughest shallow-water gamefish in the world, and they are very strong, capable of making incredibly long runs and even spooling reels at times. They do not typically take artificials, so you should fish a bottom rig with a live crab - if you don’t have crabs, try going for a shrimp or a sand flea., They have silvery sides, yellow fins, and are usually black on top. The snout is tapered, fins and jaw are large, and their side features a full-length black stripe. They are usually caught from about 3 to 15 pounds in weight, but anglers occasionally catch 20 or 30 pound fish. They taste very good, and are another of the strongest inshore gamefish. They can make multiple long runs, they often jump, and they often try to wrap the line around structure. Try fishing for them with soft plastic shrimp, but bucktails will work as well. For live bait - shrimp, mullet, menhaden, sardines, and herring all work very well., They are very large silver fish with a green back and a dark tail. They have very large scales, large scoop-jawed mouths, and there is a streamer which comes off of the end of the dorsal fin. They can be caught from under 1 pound up to 75 pounds, and anglers sometimes catch fish of 100 pounds or more. They do not taste good at all, and should always be released. They are hard fighters, targeted for their large frequent jumps. Fishing for them with artificial lures doesn’t always offer a good hookup ratio - so it's recommended to use a natural bait. Mullet, crabs, and shrimp top the list of natural baits., They are silvery fish with prominent scales and dark green backs. They have forked tails and pointed heads, and are very thick-bodied, muscular fish. They are usually caught from about 1 to 4 pounds, but they are occasionally caught up to about 10 pounds. They do not taste good, and are worth far more alive than dead. In deep water they are pretty strong, but on the flats, they make incredibly long runs which can spool a reel if not careful. Fishing smaller skimmer-style jigs works well for bonefish, but for consistency, try using a natural bait like shrimp or small crabs., They are deep-bodied fish with dark backs and silver sides with many yellow pots. They are elongated fish that have large mouths full of sharp teeth. They are usually caught from 1 to 5 pounds, but sometimes an angler gets lucky and can catch a fish up to 7 pounds or so. Fresh spanish mackerel are tasty, and on light tackle they are great fun to catch. Try fishing a small, silver artificial lure worked quickly through a school to catch them - although sometimes a live bait rig with shrimp or a small live baitfish will work. A last-ditch attempt is a jighead with a soft plastic trailer., They have heavy-set bodies, with vertical black stripes against a gray, white, or yellow body. They have spines on the dorsal and anal fins, and a mouth filled with large protruding teeth, almost like a sheep’s. They are typically caught from about 1 to 7 pounds, although anglers sometimes catch 10 pound fish. Since they mostly eat shellfish, they taste very good - and on light tackle, they use their flat shape to their advantage, and are very strong. Many anglers love a live fiddler crab for sheepshead, but live shrimp also work well., They are silver, with a green back and a large dorsal fin. They have a large scooping jaw and a forked tail, similar to a tarpon. They are usually one pound or less, although on special occasions, an angler will catch one up to about 4 pounds or so. They do not taste good at all, but for their size they are incredible fighters. They frequently jump, and make long runs that can come close to spooling a reel. They aren’t picky, so try to fish a jighead with a soft plastic trailer or a small bucktail jig for them - they are often taken on live bait rigs as well, usually rigged up with live shrimp, mullet, or other small baitfish., They are usually silver or gold, and may have wavy stripes towards the top of their body. They have small barbels on their chin, and are similar in form to a redfish. South of North Carolina, they are usually caught up to a pound, with 3 pound fish being taken every once in awhile. From North Carolina northward, they are often caught up to 3 pounds, and occasionally an angler will catch a nearly 5 pound fish. The preferred method of hunting these fish is a light bottom rig with a sand flea, shrimp, crab, bloodworm, or mud minnow., They can be brown, black, or silver in color, with or without black or yellowish stripes. They have barbels on their chin, and typically have tall dorsal fins. They are usually caught under one pound, although they are occasionally taken to about 2 pounds. They taste alright, and on light tackle they are pretty strong. A light bottom rig with squid, glass minnows, sand fleas, or shrimp is usually preferred - but if possible, it's fun to sight-fish them with a very small jighead and a small soft plastic trailer., They have deep, compressed bodies with blunt heads and a black spot on the gill cover. Their bodies are usually a dirty yellow color with white on the belly, and they have hard scutes leading towards their sickle-shaped tail. They range greatly in size, from under one pound to about 30 pounds - although a lucky angler may catch a 50 pound fish at times. They don’t taste very well, but they are generally considered the toughest fish that are readily caught inshore. They usually start the fight with a long run, and once they see the boat they typically make many smaller runs and will not hesitate to circle the boat or swim straight down in resistance. Many anglers love to fish a large topwater plug for them, but if that doesn’t work then tie on a jig of some sort. Live bait offerings include a large live mullet for larger jacks and smaller mullet or shrimp for smaller fish., They are round fish with a silver coloration and a yellow belly. They have a black dorsal fin with yellow fins everywhere else. They are usually caught to about 1 pound, although lucky anglers may catch a few 2-pounders on a good day. They are some of the best-tasting inshore fish, and they fight like a jack crevalle of equal size, with even longer and faster runs. Bottom rigs with sand fleas and shrimp produce lots of fish, but in a pinch you can also use crabs, clams, or even small minnows., While these sharks can be found from about Massachusetts southward, the best places to target these sharks are in the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida - with Florida being the “Shark Capital” of the United States. Blacktip and spinner sharks are typical-looking sharks with a gray coloration, and black tips on the fins. Bonnetheads and hammerheads have the typical shark body, except with their prominent hammer-shaped head - bonnetheads are more circular or shovel-shaped in the head than other species. Lemon sharks also have the typical shark look to them, although they are usually brown with a yellow belly - they have short dorsal fins and large pectorals. Bull sharks once again have the typical shark build, although with a shorter, wider snout and a large dorsal fin. Blacktip and spinner sharks are typically found in the 5-50 pound range, bonnetheads reach about 2-5 pounds, bulls and lemons in the 100-400 pound range, and hammerheads commonly exceeding 500 pounds in weight in certain parts of Florida.

None of these sharks taste all that well and should be released. While the size of larger sharks makes them formidable opponents (and not likely to be brought in on your inshore tackle), smaller sharks are great fun to catch on medium spinning tackle. Plenty of fish-based baits will catch sharks. A personal favorite is a chunk or stingray, a large menhaden, or a whole ladyfish - but plenty of baits will work, such as a chunk of barracuda/bonito/albacore/jack/bluefish, or a whole large mullet.

, They have the typical shape of a snapper, with a gray or olive green coloration and a white belly - they usually have a reddish tinge to them. There is a black line running from the shout to the dorsal fin, which darkens when the fish gets excited due to feeding. Inshore, these fish are usually only caught up to about 12” in length - although very occasionally, a larger fish from a deep reef will come inshore, and an angler will have a shot at a fish in the 2-6 pound class. Inshore-sized fish are very good tasting, and larger fish are still tasty but not as good. Mangroves usually make a strong run when hooked, and will fight all the way until they are brought into the boat. They can be caught on artificials, but live bait is much more hassle-free for them. They're easy to catch them on a small float rig with a shrimp, glass minnow, crab, sardine, or even a ballyhoo chunk."

Test out your backpack.",How to Pack a Light Backpack for Backpacking," Backpacks of a smaller size force you to leave more at home. Some come with less excess material, such as belts, pockets, padding, and a weight-distribution frame. Choose a pack that is an appropriate size for your trip.Keep in mind, however, that larger packs, such as those with frames, might feel better to wear due to better weight balancing and more comfortable strap material.
You may also cut excess features off the pack, such as extra pockets and buckles, to reduce weight.;
, In warm, dry climates, you can get by with a hammock or a sleeping bag. When there’s rain, take a lightweight tarp. Ultralight tents, though heavier than tarps, offer more privacy and better protection from the elements. Determine the type of shelter that matches your needs and find its lightest variety.When bugs are a problem in the area, you can bring a mesh shelter. Use the tarp or tent poles to hold it up instead of carrying separate poles.

, Down sleeping bags are the warmest option at night. These bags are easier to pack and weigh less than synthetic bags. Down bags are susceptible to water, but many companies now treat the bags to be more water-resistant.Down bags can be protected from wet weather by lining the inside of your pack with a garbage bag.

, Every item in your pack must be a necessity. Many items can be used in more than one way. Think of a Swiss army knife. With a Swiss army knife, you wouldn’t have to bring both a knife and scissors. Similarly, you won’t need to bring a spoon and a fork in order to eat. Also, dental floss can be used for teeth as well as thread for sewing up damaged gear., Take time to figure out how much of each you will require between checkpoints. Water in particular is a heavy weight. If there are streams or other refilling points on your route, you won’t have to lug around so much water.Bring a water filter instead and hydrate at home and at water sources.

, Dried food saves you space and weight. Plan out calorie-dense meals using granola bars, tortillas, nuts, dried fruit, jerky, instant oatmeal, and other foods. On longer trips, you may be able to leave the stove at home or bring less fuel.With calorie-dense foods, such as granola or peanut butter, you need less food to keep up your energy.

, Consider reducing your load to as little as two whole sets of clothing. This way, you’ll always have a dry set. Keep your clothes multifunctional and durable. Convertible pants can be adjusted for hot and cold weather. Instead of bringing multiple shirts, try combining short-sleeve shirts with armwarmers., Cotton doesn’t resist water. When it gets wet, it won’t insulate you from the cold and will feel heavier. Instead, opt for wool or a synthetic material such as polyester for your inner layer. Get socks, underwear, and overshirts in these materials. Your convertible pants, rain pants, and rain jacket can be nylon.Keep protective clothing light too. Select a down jacket and other lightweight material.
Look for quick-drying fabrics, like fleece, polyurethane, and Gore-Tex. Examples include Event, Marmot Membrane, and Polartec NeoShell., You don’t need to bring a bulky coat or heavy clothing to stay warm. Instead, choose warm, lightweight fabrics. Wear long underwear to protect your skin. This can be used as pajamas and can be zipped down from the neck in warmer weather. Build upon this protective layer with a layer of clothing for walking, then a layer for insulation.Socks, gloves, and hats should never be doubled. Choose thin, lightweight material such as wool or synthetics. You will only need one set of lightweight gloves and one hat.
Remember that during the day, moving will make you warmer and cause you to sweat more. At night, you’ll stay warm inside your sleeping bag.

, Try to find ways to treat emergencies with the supplies you already have. Duct tape can help you treat wounds, so you can cut down on medical bandages. Parachute cord used for clotheslines or fastening gear can be wrapped around spare clothing to set injured limbs.Dental floss can be used to repair gear. Store it in your medical kit with a needle instead of bringing a sewing kit.
Other emergency gear you may wish to bring include a compass, a map, emergency kindling, and a lighter. A cell phone can serve functions such as being a light source, but should not be relied upon for long outdoor trips.

, Go one by one through every object you plan on bringing. Consider how much of a necessity the object is and if there is another object that can fill in for it. For example, duct tape can be used to repair gear and wrap wounds, so you don’t need to carry medical bandages too.


Remember that you can also cut your objects to reduce weight. File down the handle of your spoon and toothbrush. Cut labels and excess material off your gear. These small weights add up when you have to carry them.

, The forecast can help determine how much you need to carry. If there’s no rain on the way, you can leave behind the rain fly on your tent or sleep in open air. In cold weather, you won’t want to carry light clothing and vice-versa.

, Make the items you’ll use throughout the day easily accessible. Snacks, such as granola bars, and necessities, such as bug spray and sunscreen, can rest in the pockets on your hips and pack straps so you don’t have to disturb your pack.

, Trash bags are cheaper and lighter than pack covers but still resist water. Place one at the bottom of your pack and, as you add items, place them between the items and the pack. You can also store your items inside the bags., When using a frameless backpack, you have to take extra care to balance the pack’s weight. The items you don’t need until you camp should be at the bottom. Big items, such as a stove or your shelter, should be balanced between lighter objects., While you can hang items from your pack’s straps, this makes your pack more cumbersome. Instead, adjust the items to take up as little space as possible. Anything that appears unnecessary or disrupts your balance should be moved. For example, you can reorganize your food into sealed bags. Remove your floss from the plastic container. Make sure everything you think you need fits into your pack.

, Strap on the pack. Hit a local trail or carry the pack up a flight of stairs. You will be able to feel how heavy it is and figure out how to rebalance the load. Take this opportunity to discard any objects you determine aren’t a necessity."

The solution should include one cup of salt for every gallon of vinegar., Hooks aren’t usually very sturdy to begin with, so if it looks like the rust has compromised the integrity of the hook, see if the hook can be removed and replaced. A pair of O-ring pliers can help you remove the old hook.Be sure to replace it with a hook of the same weight and size so that it doesn’t impact the action of the lure.If you are having trouble finding a replacement hook that matches, you can find a good selection online., If you don’t protect lures with feathers, bugs will get into the tacklebox and eat away at them. Keep lures with feathers in airtight bags. Do not remove them from their packaging until you use them., When a soft plastic lure begins to show signs of damage, you can often use tail dips to recolor it and bring it back to life. Many fishermen like to experiment with different colors of paint to see what draws the fish.Tail dips are paints designed specifically for plastic fishing lures. You can often dip the lure directly in the paint. Other times you can drop or spray some on top of the lure., When a wooden lure gets scratched, rub sandpaper over it smooth out the scratch. Then, cover it up by applying enamel or lacquer. Use a small paint brush and some paint to fill in the paint job."

Lay the crappie flat against the cutting surface.,
Make a vertical cut just behind the gills.,
Turn your knife horizontally in the cut.,
Run the blade along the backbone to the tail.,
Separate the meat from the skin.,
Remove the ribcage.,
Repeat on the opposite side.,
Dispose of the unused parts of the fish.,
Put the fillets on ice.,
Rinse the fillets before cooking or storing.,
Cook the crappie right away.,
Store the crappie in the refrigerator or freezer.",How to Clean Crappie," Place the fish horizontally with its tail on the same side as your dominant hand. This will allow you to work more fluidly. Hold the crappie by the head as you prepare to make your first cut.If you’re right-handed, the head of the fish should be to your left; if you’re left-handed, arrange it so that it’s on your right.
Assuming you don’t have access to a cutting board, look for another level surface to set the crappie on, like a smooth rock or the edge of the boat.;
, Insert the tip of the knife between the back of the gill plate and the pectoral fin. Cut into the gills at a slight angle toward the head. Continue cutting until you reach the backbone, but be careful not to sever it.It’s important to keep the backbone intact, as you’ll use it as a guide when cutting.
Carving along the backbone will enable you to fillet the fish without the need to first remove the head or tail.

, Once you’ve made contact with the backbone, keep the blade in the incision and twist it until the edge points toward the tail. If you do this correctly, there will be no need to make any other clumsy cuts.The first cut is intended to open up the fish and create an entry point that you can then use to strip the fillet.
Angle the blade downward to keep the edge as close to the skin as possible.

, Holding the head firmly, begin dragging the knife steadily down the entire length of the crappie. Rather than attempting to saw through the skin, simply push the blade and let the meat come free. Stop when you reach the rear section of the fish near the tail.If you’re cutting close enough to the backbone, you should be able to feel the contours of each individual rib as you push the knife through.Holding the loose flap with your opposite hand while you cut can give you a little extra leverage and stability.

, Peel back the fillet so that it’s laying flat against the cutting surface. Then, starting at the tail, slide the edge of the knife between the skin and meat and make a clean pass from one end to the other. The fillet should lift away in one smooth piece.Keep the blade tilted slightly downward to avoid cutting into the meat.
You also have the option of leaving the skin on until after you cook the crappie. It fries up nice and crispy, and can be quite flavorful.

, Toward the head end of the fillet you’ll find the ribcage still attached. Use the curved tip of the knife to trace around the edges of the ribcage, being careful not to waste any meat. The deboned fillet should have a ‘V’ shape.Look closely for the ribcage after peeling back the first fillet. It may not be immediately visible if it's covered up by meat or other tissues.
Don’t worry if there are one or two rib bones left behind—you can pry these out with your knife, a pair of tweezers or the tines of a fork.

, Turn the fish over and follow the same procedure, starting with a vertical cut behind the gills. When you’re finished, be left with two fillets that you can then cook or put away for later., Keep a trash receptacle nearby as you work so you’ll have someplace to drop the discarded bones, skin and entrails. Fish gives off an unpleasant odor as it decomposes, so it’s best to put the unused bits in a separate bag that you can close and tie off before tossing them out.Raw fish tends to be full of bacteria and can become a health concern if not thrown out right away.

, If you’re cleaning the crappie on site, be sure to bring along a cooler to keep them cold. That way, you can be certain that they'll stay fresh until you can get them home. You can stick the whole fish in the cooler, or dress them immediately and chill the fillets in plastic bags to make better use of the space you have available.If possible, use saltwater ice. The salt will help preserve the fish even more efficiently.Make sure the cooler you bring is big enough to pack in a bountiful harvest.

, Run the crappie under a stream of cool water to wash off any blood, scales or other tissue. Let the excess water drip off, then pat the fillets with a layer of folded paper towels to soak up some of the moisture from inside the fish.Watery fish can be difficult to cook properly, and will often turn out with a dull flavor.

, The best way to enjoy crappie is fresh out the water. Put the fillets on ice until it’s time to eat, then grill, broil or deep fry them, or simply throw them in a hot pan with with some oil and a dash of salt and pepper. The mild, slightly sweet flavor of the fish lends itself well to a variety of dishes.The less time the crappie spends exposed to warm temperatures, the better it will taste.
Use crappie in some of your favorite recipes that call for freshwater fish., If you’re not planning on serving your catch immediately, it’s important to keep them at a temperature below about 40°F (4.5°C). Get them back home as soon as you call it a day. You can cover them in plastic wrap and tuck them away in one of the drawers in your refrigerator, or vacuum seal and freeze them until you’re ready to whip up a fish dinner.Try to consume your refrigerated catch within 10-12 days of bringing it home.When properly frozen, fish like crappie will stay good for up to a year.A vacuum sealer is an indispensable piece of equipment for people who like to catch and eat fresh fish."

Bring a small cooler with a couple of ice cold water bottles to camp.,
Bring something to wipe yourself off as your hike, you are going to sweat a lot.,
Bring a fan so you can cool yourself.,
Bring loose clothing like tank tops and shorts.,
Bring thin blankets, not large and thick ones, for nights.,
Keep your head covered/shaded as best you can.,
Don't wear a shirt if you are a boy, except in the sun.,
Girls stick to a thin cotton t-shirt.",How to Stay Cool when Its Hot at Camp," In that cooler you want to pack 6 20oz. soda bottles; 2 of them full of ice; 2 of them with about 2 inches (5.1 cm) of ice in the bottom and filled will cool/cold water; and the other 2 full of cold water. Not only will you be refreshed, all of your fellow campers will appreciate the water, especially if they didn't bring any water for their own. Water cools the body. The more you drink, the more you can sweat, making you cooler in the long run. There is a point where you can overdo it, so be careful.;
, You don't want to be a fountain of sweat, do you? Bring 2 or 3 large bandannas, the kind you find in department stores. Soak one in cool water from the sink, roll it up, and tie it lightly around your neck. As the water evaporates it will carry off heat. Take another and wrap it around your water bottle. It will soak up the condensation from the bottle. When you wipe your brow you will also get a cool wipe.

, There are some excellent portable fans that you can buy from a local drugstore. They are portable and they have a lanyard that you can hang on your neck so that you don't have to hold onto the fan the whole time. The fans usually cost from about 1 dollar to 5 dollars. They are cheap and convenient. If you forgot to get one when you were packing your luggage, try to fold a paper fan.

, Bringing clothes like that would help a lot if the weather there is scorching.


Gently moisten loose clothing. It wicks off heat the same way as the bandanna. The loose clothing should also be light clothing. It wouldn't make much sense to wear sweat pants in the middle of the desert. Even if you're not in the desert, the clothing traps the sun's heat, making you warmer. In other words, wear appropriate clothing for the environment.

, If it happens to be cool at night, you can use a thin blanket. You don't want to be sweating your blanket until it's soaked when the air heats up.

, Straw hats or wet cloth hats are good, or stay in the shade. If the sun is shining on your head, you will only feel warmer. Do not wear fuzzy hats or any hats that will only trap heat inside the hat.

, You can't afford to burn. That is the best way to stay cool. At night also don't wear a shirt unless it gets cold at night.

, Something that breathes well. I know it's flattering, but this is not the place for the tight jeans.

Lay the pike on it's belly and cut about half inch down right behind the head.,
Angle the blade towards the tail and cut all the way towards the fin.,
Cut upwards, mimicking the angle of the back fin, to remove the top fillet.,
Use pliers, your fingers, or careful knife work to remove any center bones from the fillet.,
Skin the fillet, if desired, while still fresh.,
Use a finger feel out the Y-shaped bones poking out of the top of the fish.,
Flip the fish on its side and plunge the knife in behind the head.,
Turn the knife and cut down to the dorsal fin, using the Y-bones as you guide.,
Pull up as you reach the dorsal fins to complete the fillet.,
Check for any stray bones, pulling away with pliers or your fingers.,
Flip the fish over and repeat on the opposite side.,
Locate the vent, a small hole on the underside of the fish.,
Plunge the knife in just behind the vent, towards the tail.,
Cut along the fish until you just about reach the end.,
Starting at this hinge, get the knife between the skin and meat to easily remove the skin and scales.,
Use a spoon to scoop out any extra meat around the bones if making a stew, fish patties, meat balls, etc.",How to Clean and Fillet a Northern Pike," You'll want a nice, at least 6-inch fillet knife to work with. Cut right behind where the head of the pike meets the body, slicing down until your hit resistance. This is the fish's backbone.
, Use the backbone as a guide, running down to the top fin. Your entire blade should be in the fish, removing a 1-1/2 inch fillet of flesh from the fish's ""back."", As you reach the dorsal fin, start curving up so that your knife exits right before you hit the fin. This top fillet should be boneless, as you can stay above all the bones using this method. That said, don't worry if there is bone running down the center., There shouldn't be many, but take care of them now. If they are deeply embedded, which is more common with larger fish, you may need a set of clean pliers to remove them., To do so, slide the knife between the skin and flesh, pushing it through the other side. Holding the top of the fish down with one hand, slice all the way down the fillet to remove the fish. Go slowly to prevent accidentally cutting off the meat.Some people like to keep the knife still, and actually pull on the skin, ripping it off by keeping the knife between the flesh and skin., These will be your guides as you cut into the side of the fish. If necessary, use your knife to cut lightly into them, exposing the tops so that you can see your guides as you get into the side fillets., This will be right in line with the cut you made on the top of the fish. Again, cut until you hit the bones, which you exposed in the last step. It won't be quite as deep as you went in the top fillet, as the sides are a bit thinner., Cut as close to these bones as possible without hitting them to get the most meat. Keep the knife parallel to the cutting board to get a nice, flat fillet., If you want, use your knife to square off any of the edges for a more restaurant-quality fillet. If you'd like, now is also the time to skin the fish., This usually happens if you cut too deep, or at an accidental angle. That said, there are worse problems to have, as you can easily pull a few stray bones out of the fish., The process is the same, though it can be a little harder to keep the fish balanced with its other side missing. Remember to go slow and use a sharp knife, trying to stay parallel to the cutting board the entire time., This little hole, the fish's anus, is located on the belly of the fish near the tail. Locate it as the starting point for your fish.Cutting the tail fillets of a pike is just like any other fish. If you already know what you're doing, there are no extra bones or steps to worry about with northern pike.

, Cut down until you hit the remains of the backbone, then angle the knife back towards the tail. You want to be just tail-side of the vent, so that it is not in your fillet. This hole only provides your starting point -- you don't want to cook it!, You don't want to totally cut the fillet off. It should have a small ""hinge"" of skin right where the flesh meets the tail, so you can pull the meat off the fish like an opening door., Leaving the fillet just barely on the fish makes it much easier to skin, as the tail forms a natural hinge., There is plenty of good meat left on the fish if you're not only interested in the fillets. Simply use a spoon and your knife to pull the meat off the bones and sort out any last bits of bone."

Get a plastic bag or bucket ready for guts and bones and lay out newspaper to keep clean.,
Using a dull knife or spoon, use a quick raking motion to remove the scales.,
If cleaning a bullhead (also known as a Sculpin), catfish, or another thick-skinned bottom feeder, consider skinning it.,
Cut a shallow incision from the anus up towards the head.,
Use your fingers or a dull spoon to scoop out the fish's innards.,
Scrape out any dark, inner membrane if found.,
Cut off the head off directly behind the gills, if desired.,
Remove a dorsal fin by pulling firmly from tail to head.,
Rinse the fish off, inside and out, in cool water.",How to Clean a Fish1," Have your disposal system ready before you start cutting so you can toss the guts and excess fish without getting up. Newsprint laid out on the cutting surface is helpful for soaking up the inevitable liquids that will spill out of the fish., You want to work against the normal direction of the scales, raking up from tail to head. Think of a short, shallow, scoop motion, getting under the scales and pushing up and into them quickly to rake them out of the fish. The back side of a knife, held a little less than perpendicular to the fish, works well too.








Get both sides, the top, and bottom of the fish.
It can help to scale under running water, or simply underwater in the sink, to prevent a mess.
Don't worry if you miss a few scales -- they aren't tasty, but they won't hurt anyone., These fish, in particular, have a thick, unappealing skin that most people remove before cooking. To do so, cut a 1"" notch right where the top of the fish's head meets its body. Then, gripping the fish from the head, peel the skin back to the tail. Rinse thoroughly when done., The small hole on the belly of the fish, back near the tail, is the anus. Using a sharp knife, make a shallow cut from here along the belly of the fish, stopping at the base of the gills.









Don't jam the knife in their, or you'll cut the intestines open. You want a shallow cut so that you can pull them out intact, preventing messy (and unappetizing) spillage., Get in there and get everything out. These gummy, long guts should come out without much of a fight. Make sure to check inside to get out anything you missed, like the large, dark kidney in the back or some strands of innards along the walls.







, Not all fish have this thin layer in their inner cavity, but you want to remove it if they do. This is strongly flavored and has an oily, extra-fishy aroma that you don't want in your final dish., You do not have to cut the head off, and depending on your cooking method you might not want to, as the head adds flavor and depth. The ""cheek meat"" of the fish, as well, is considered the best part in some cultures.

, This, like the head, does not have to come off if you don't want to remove it, but it will help remove many nasty little bones. Simply grip the fin tightly near the tail, and pull quickly in the direction of the head to rip it out cleanly.







, Make sure you wash the outside, getting rid of any sticky scales, as well as the inside, getting rid of bits and blood. Your fish is now ready to cook!

Wet the cork.,
Apply the cleaning solution to the rod grip.,
Scrub the grip thoroughly, end to end.,
Rinse the cleaning solution off the grip.

,
Let the grip dry thoroughly.",How to Clean a Fly Fishing Rod1," You can do this with either a wet cloth or paper towel, or by putting the grip under running water.;
, Acceptable cleaners include a bleach solution (including liquid sink cleaners), dish or hand soap, toothpaste, rubbing alcohol, or pine cleaner. You can apply the cleaner in small amounts at a time using a sponge, a washcloth, or toothbrush.


If applying a bleach solution with a sponge or washcloth, you should put on rubber gloves to protect your hands.

, Keep the cleaning solution only on the grip; avoid getting it on the reel seat or rod blank and damaging the finish of either.

,,


If the rod grip is very dirty, you may wish to sand it lightly with fine-grit sandpaper before using the cleaning solution. If you do this, you'll need to apply a waterproofing sealant to the cork after it dries.

Get the appropriate strength line.,
Get the right line for freshwater fishing.,
Get the right line for saltwater fishing.,
Use monofilament line as your basic standard line.",How to Choose Fishing Line1," Before you choose a line, be clear about what kind of fishing you are taking on. Fishing lines have a pound-test strength, which can go from one pound all the way up to 75. Choosing which lbs test line you are going to use depends on what fish you are looking for. But as a rule of thumb, the smaller the line the narrower it’s diameter, so the less likely it is to put off the fish.The lbs test refers to amount of force the line should be able to withstand at its weakest point.
It does not meant that you cannot catch a fish bigger than 12lbs on a 12lbs test line.
You can use the drag on your reel to help you to do this.;
, As well as getting the right strength line, you should also choose a line that best matches the water you will be fishing in. Because freshwater is less dense than saltwater, freshwater lines will be generally have larger diameters and lower line densities than saltwater lines, in order to improve flotation., Saltwater fishing line will generally be designed for quick accurate casts that can travel long distances. If you take a freshwater line saltwater fishing, it won’t help you to get the results you are hoping for. With the denser saltwater you can use a line with a smaller diameter without compromising on floatation., There are a number of different types of line which are constructed in different ways with different strengths and weakness. Monofilament line is the most popular line for most uses, as it is thin and strong. You can get monofilament line that is of a very narrow diameter which will be less intrusive in the water, but doesn’t lose its pound-test strength.Monofilament line is relatively inexpensive, and this contributes to its popularity.It will break down over time when exposed to direct sunlight, so look to replace it every six months or a year."

Look in North American ponds, lakes, rivers and streams.,
Fish for perch in late summer, fall and winter.,
Look for perch at sunrise and sunset.,
Fish near rocks and edges.",How to Catch Yellow Perch1," Perch are common across the US and Canada. Since they're available in so many spots, and they're relatively easy to catch, perch fishing is a popular activity among anglers and families alike. Look for perch in these places in particular:


Mississippi River
Great Lakes
Freshwater areas in the Midwestern, Northeastern and Northwestern US
Freshwater areas in British Columbia, Nova Scotia and Quebec;
, Perch are active all year round, so you can technically fish them at any time of year. However, the period from late summer through early spring is the best time to catch perch..


During warmer weather, perch are found in shallower waters.
In the winter, they go deeper. Ice fishing for perch is popular in winter., During these periods, perch are most active in shallow waters. They're also easy to find in morning and late afternoon. Don't bother fishing for perch at night, though, since they're rarely active once the sun goes down.

, Like many fish species, perch can often be found near rocky areas or edges of structures that provide shelter. They like to move among piles of rocks and wood, rather than spending time in completely open water. Look for places with an abundance of underwater structure or plentiful vegetation.If you're new to a particular lake, pond or stream, go to the local bait and tackle shop and ask where the perch like to hang out. You can often get wind of the best fishing spots by asking others with local experience.

Lay the fish on one side and cut just behind the top of the head until you hit the backbone.,
Continue this cut in an arc around the fish's head.,
Turn the knife and cut horizontally towards the tail, through the center of the fish.,
Flip the fish and repeat on the opposite side.,
Using a smaller knife, lift and remove the ribcage from the inside of the fillet.,
Scale the fish or remove the skin entirely.,
Alternatively, use a sharp knife to cut directly through the fish, perpendicularly, to form steaks.",How to Clean a Fish2," Don't cut through the spine, just to it.







, Again, you don't want to cut deeper than the backbone. You will not be cutting the head off, just cutting about halfway into the fish.








, You'll basically be cutting off the entire side of the fish, removing the whole flank, skin and all. The knife will travel perpendicularly to the backbone, which you can use as a guide to ensure a nice, flat cut.







, Simply repeat the same process on the other half of the fish, removing the other fillet.








, This will be the small, almost translucent set of bones on the lower third of fish fillet. It should come off in one piece.







, If you want to cook the fish with the skin still on, use the dull side of a knife to rake the scales off. Use a short, lifting motion from the tail to the head to quickly scrape all of the scales off. If you don't want the skin, simply slide the knife between the fish and the skin and simply cut the skin away., To do so, you simply cut perpendicular to the backbone, going all the way through the spine to get thick, 1"" steaks. This is common with bigger fish -- trout and salmon -- and retains the spine running through the middle of the fish."

Remove spots of dirt with a cleaning solution.,
Dry the rod blank.,
Inspect the rod guides for grooves.,
Consider applying a polish.",How to Clean a Fly Fishing Rod2," You can use the same cleaner you used for the cork grip or soapy water. Apply it with a soft cloth.

, As you do this, look for dirt at the feet of the rod guides and remove any you find with a cotton swab.

, Nicks and grooves in the guides can cause similar nicks in the line as it rubs over them, possibly causing it to break when you've hooked and are trying to land a fish. You can inspect the rods under bright light with a magnifying glass, or you can run a strip of nylon hosiery through the guide to see if it gets snagged.


In most cases, when 1 guide is nicked, they all are and should be replaced together. In a pinch, you can sand out nicks with 600 or 1000-grit sandpaper.

, Using a polish on the rod blank not only preserves its finish, it also helps keep dirt off the rod. Depending on the kind of polish you use, you can spray it on or apply it with a soft cloth.


You can also simplify the cleaning process by using a spray-on furniture polish containing a cleaning agent instead of using a separate cleaner and polish. This is particularly effective on older fly rods made of bamboo.

"
"
Separate the rod sections.

,
Clean the female (open) ferrule with a cotton swab dipped in alcohol.

,
Clean the male (protruding) ferrule with a soft cloth, dipped in alcohol.,
Let the ferrules dry.

,
Lubricate the male ferrule(s).",How to Clean a Fly Fishing Rod3,",, Alcohol is necessary if your fly rod has fiberglass or graphite ferrules; if your fly rod has metal ferrules, you can often get by with using just a clean, soft cloth to clean the male ferrule.

,, A thin coating of paraffin (candle wax) or silicone grease is recommended. Lubricating the ferrules makes it easier to assemble and disassemble your fly rod.


Don't lubricate the ferrule by rubbing it against the side of your nose, as the ferrule will pick up dirt from your skin as well as its natural oils.
When putting your fly rod together or taking it apart, push and pull the sections straight if your rod has metal ferrules. If your rod has fiberglass or graphite ferrules, you can use a twisting motion when assembling or disassembling the rod.

"
"
Clean the reel seat with the same cleaner you used on the rod blank.,
Polish the reel seat dry.",How to Clean a Fly Fishing Rod4," You can use either the cleaning solution or a spray-on furniture polish. Whichever cleaner you use, apply it to a soft cloth to do the actual cleaning, not directly onto the reel seat. Rub gently; however, you may need to scrub to get rid of stuck-on dirt from the reel spacers.


In a pinch, you can also rinse away dirt by flushing the seat with warm water.

, You may also want to apply an actual polishing compound to the reel seat.

Use high-viz line for offshore fishing with multiple lines.,
Consider a ‘metered’ or ‘indicator’ line for offshore trolling.,
Use a strong monofilament line for deep sea fishing.",How to Choose Fishing Line2," Different colours and visibilities of line work well in different situations. High-viz lines are most often used for offshore fishing as they make it easier to keep track of your lines.If you need an instant read on the position of your lines, such as when offshore trolling or kite fishing, then high-viz line is often the best choice.


Different people will have had different experience with different colours, so always ask around and see what seems to be working well in particular areas.

, Another alternative to a high-viz line is what is known as a ‘metered’, or ‘indicator’ line. These lines have sections of coloured line of varied number, but of short and equal lengths. The colour changes make it easy to set lures at particular measurements when you are offshore trolling., If you are graduating to serious offshore fishing for huge tuna or marlin, then you want a line with a good pound-test strength. This kind of fishing takes you a long way from shore, so you need a reliable line that can handle the pressure of big fish. A monofilament line with a 20 lbs-test strength should do the job.A gold high-viz line will help you keep track of the line.

"
"
Use a braided line for strength and abrasion resistance.,
Choose a low-viz line.,
For a line with good abrasion resistance but lower visibility choose a fluorocarbon line.,
Use a braided line to cut through weeds.,
Use a ‘metered’ or ‘indicator’ line for jigging.",How to Choose Fishing Line3," In contrast to monofilament line, braided lines generally have a wider diameter, and are best suited for taking on larger fish in murkier waters where visibility is less important. Braided line is made up from woven fibres that give it incredible strength, as well as durability, and high abrasion resistance. Fishing in thick cover or muddy water will diminish the visibility of the braided line.They also have no stretch, so you can feel more at the end of your line than you might with a monofilament line.

, Traditionally, low visibility lines of green, bronze and brown are used for inshore fishing. Moss green is great for fishing in an area with heavy weeds in the water.The muddy substrate and off-colour water help to obscure the line so it disappears in water and the fish don’t notice it so easily., Braided lines have excellent abrasion resistance to get over rocks and snags without breaking, but fluorocarbon line is also a good choice for this. It is much less visible than a braided line, and like braided line does not stretch, so you still have better feel than with a monofilament line., Often fish like Bass will retreat into the weeds and be hard to reach for your cast, as the line can get caught up the greenery, stalks and weeds above and below the water’s surface. Using a braided line is the best way to fish in these conditions, as braided line cut really cut through those weeds with a minimum of fuss., Line with coloured sections are great for jigging in shore, as they give you a good reference point for depth. You can carry out precision vertical jigging by using the changing colours to wind up a particular depth after casting."
"
Use a fluorocarbon line.,
Use a clear line.,
Use a gold high-viz monofilament line when you need to see multiple lines.",How to Choose Fishing Line4," If you are going fishing in light cover, clear water, or rocky terrain, often a fluorocarbon line is the best choice. It is much less visible than braided line, and has excellent abrasion resistance to get around rocks and logs.Fluorocarbon line is, in fact, almost invisible under water as it has a light refractive index that closely matches that of water, so the light passes through the line without reflecting back.Fluorocarbon line will not weaken in the same way that monofilament line does.
It is also stretches less, so you will have greater sensitivity on your line., A clear blue fluorescent line is absolutely perfect for fishing in the sunshine.Under the water it will remain clear so the fish can’t see it, but the light from above the water will reflect off of it so that you will be able to see it from above the water. You being able to see the line and keep track of it when the fish can’t is a good start., If you are out fishing and you have numerous lines out, it can be hard to keep track of them all, especially if the sun is reflective off the water strongly. Gold monofilament line is a good choice for these conditions, but it will be more visible to the fish than a fluorocarbon or clue blue fluorescent line."
"
Use a light jig.,
Try a basic rod and reel combination.,
Use a small lure.,
Use live bait.",How to Catch Yellow Perch2," Using a jig 5 to 5 ½ inches in length is best. You want to be able to feel the slightest nibble.However, if the weather is windy or you aim to catch bigger fish, you'll need a slightly heavier jig so you can maintain control.

, It’s a popular choice and works well for open water fishing.There are no hard and fast rules when it comes to choosing your rod and reel combination for catching perch. Whatever you're comfortable with should work just fine when you're fishing open water from a boat.


You might want to consider getting a fast action rod tip. This helps you detect subtle bites, which is helpful since perch are known for stealing bait.
Get a shorter rod to use in the winter. Ice fishing rods are 3 feet (0.9 m) in length.
You should choose the lightest line possible for the type of fishing you’re doing. 4 to 6 pound test line is preferred., Perch have small mouths and need a smaller-sized lure. There are dozens of choices, many of which have been used to great affect, but the one sixty-fourth and one thirty-second leadhead lures are the most popular to use for fishing perch. Pick out lures with an array of different-colored skirts, since there’s no telling what the perch will like on a given day.

, Perch prefer live bait, although some anglers have had success with crayfish meat. Ask around at the local bait and tackle shop to find out what perch in your particular area like to eat. These are the most popular choices:


Minnows
Insect larvae
Night worms

Fish from a boat in open water when it's chilly.,
Fish from the shore near structures when it's warm.,
Fish near the bottom.,
Consider using a sonar fishfinder.,
Try various techniques.,
Land fish quickly when the action starts.",How to Catch Yellow Perch3," This makes it easier to access the deeper waters where perch like to spend time throughout the fall and winter months. It's also easier to move to a new spot if they're just not biting where you set up at first., This is especially effective in early spring, when they tend to be in shallower places. Look for a spot near a rock pile, wood pile, or plenty of vegetation on the floor of the pond, lake or river. Fish near places where structures meet open water.

, No matter how shallow the water is, or what time of year, the perch will be near the bottom of the lake, pond or river you're fishing. You'll be more successful if you can position the bait there.

, Perch commonly travel in schools and hide in the dense vegetation or mud. A good technique is to use sonar to locate the schools of yellow perch, then choose a jig that resembles the vegetation or mud in which they are hiding.


Maggots with weights forcing them to sink to the bottom should be used when the schools are feeding on insects and plankton.
Bobbers should be added to the line when perch are schooling in plant vegetation. This will help keep your bait still and prevent the perch from steeling it off the hook.

, You need to figure out how to best reach the perch where you are. If something isn’t working, try a new technique. Just as your bait should be adjusted to attract perch according to their current feeding location, you should also adjust your technique to fit the situation.


Allow the bait to hit the bottom before wheeling back in.
If you have hit in one spot and then the bites have quieted, cast in a circle around the boat.
Run the boat motor, perch are attracted by the noise and vibration.
Hit the rod against the bottom, then move the rod in quick little flicks to make the bait vibrate.

, You might wait for hours to get a nibble, but when you catch one, many more usually follow, since perch hang out in schools. Land each fish and get your line back out to catch more.

Choose your bait.,
Pick a lure.,
Get the best rod.",How to Catch Walleye1," Live bait is the best to use when catching walleyes. The three basic types of live bait for this fish are minnows, leeches, and night crawlers. Minnows are the most useful, but walleyes are attracted to all of them. Which one you need at a particular time depends on the season.


For live bait, all you need is a hook. Try a hook in sizes 1-4 to catch good sized walleye.
For spring, use minnows, especially the small redtail chubs and fathead variety.
For summer, fish with leeches and night crawlers.
For autumn, try minnows such as the large redtail chubs and small suckers.;
, You can also use a lure when fishing for walleye. The live bait can be added to the hooks on the lures to entice the walleye to bite. Lures, which are sometimes called jigs, vary in weight and color. You should use different colors and weights depending on the time of year you plan to fish.


In spring, you should use a light lure around 1/8 oz. They can be in bright colors such as red, chartreuse, yellow, or white. White is considered the most appealing because of its brightness. The bright colors will attract even non feeding walleye.
In late spring and summer, use heavier jigs. If you are fishing shallower, use a 3/8 oz. If you are fishing deeper, use a 1/4 oz weight. The walleye like natural colors such as brown, silver, black, and white this time of year.
During the fall, jigs are not typically used because they get stuck when you troll the bottom of the river or lake. Use live bait on a normal hook instead., The type of rod and reel you will need depends on the season and kind of lure you are using. The weight of the jigs and kind of fishing you plan to do also help determine the kind of rod and reel you need. Spinning rods and trolling reels are used most often when fishing for walleye. The power and line capacity will also vary depending on the rod.


The power refers the the weight capabilities of the rod and is listed on the rod. It can either be listed as a phrase such as light or as a number between 1-10.
Line capacity, described as test line rating, is the amount of weight that the line is rated for. This can range from just a few pounds to over 50 pounds.
You can use two different kinds of 7 foot spinning rods for walleye fishing. For early spring walleye fishing in shallow water, you need to look for a 7 foot rod with light power. This needs to have 4-6 pound line. You can use lures from 1/32 oz to 1/8 oz.
For later spring, summer, and fall walleye fishing, use a 7 foot rod with medium light to medium power. It should have 8-12 pound line and can use lures that weigh 1/8 oz to 3/4 oz.
For trolling walleye, you can use a trolling reel. These reels work on any medium power rod. For general trolling, use a 7 foot, 6 inch rod with medium power and a heavy weight line."

Locate a freshwater stream away from the city where the water is clean.,
Assemble the following: diving boots, headlamp or lantern, spear, a five gallon pail or cloth bag, and glove.,
Wait until the conditions are ideal.,
Try using a net.,
Consider using a trap.",How to Catch Tahitian Prawns," Scout a stream during the day and return later at night.;
, The spear can be a small diameter mop handle with a spear tip fastened on, and an eating fork spear tip with the tines spread and not sharpened is better. The purpose of the spear is to pin the prawn to the stream bottom until they can be grabbed. Avoid puncturing the prawn with a sharpened spear. Prawns have claws that can reach behind their back so a glove is used.

, When it has not rained for a while and the steam depth is low till knee height or lower is good. Catching prawns is best done at night, their eyes glow from the lantern's (or flashlight's) light.

, Prawns can also be caught with a net. A rectangular shaped net with two handles on each end is superior to a round scoop net because they conform to the stream bottom by design. The front of the net has crimped-on lead weights and these weights keep the net down and further conform to the bottom.

, Tube shaped traps are used for catching prawns in bulk and they work better than the rectangular shaped traps. For simple, one-time harvesting of prawns, spears are the way to go.

Rinse the fish and position it on its side.,
Slit the fish from anus to throat.,
Separate the gills from the head with your knife.,
Open the body and remove entrails from the fish.,
Scrape out the kidney of the fish.,
Remove the head and fins.,
Store your cleaned trout in your refrigerator.,
Cut the fish at the gill line.,
Follow the backbone with your knife while cutting toward the tail.,
Remove the rib cage from the meat.,
Skin the trout.",How to Clean a Trout," Hold your fish under cold running water to remove slime from it. Lay out a cutting board on a flat surface, like a counter or table. Position the fish flat on its side, with the bottom of the fish facing towards you.Cleaning a fish is messy work. Lay down a plastic table cover or butcher paper on your work surface for easy cleanup.;
, The anus of the trout will appear like a small round hole on the bottom of the fish, a little over halfway from the head to the tail. Insert the tip of the knife into the anus and cut shallowly along the belly towards the head.When your knife is about even with the gills, remove it from the fish.Cutting too deeply could cause the knife to penetrate the intestines. Puncturing the intestines will release whatever was digesting in the fish and is often accompanied by an unpleasant odor.
Accidentally cutting into the intestines will expose the meat to enzymes and bacteria. This may cause the fish to spoil faster. Rinse digested matter thoroughly from the fish if this happens., Cut through the skin connecting the mouthward curving base of the gills and the head of the fish.The knife should sever the skin a short distance before the bottom of the mouth, on what might be considered the “chin” of the fish., Pry open the body with your hands. Hold the fish by its jaw with one hand and grasp the gills with the other.Pull firmly on the gills to remove them along with accompanying guts.Loose entrails should be put into a separate plastic bag before being thrown away. This will cut down on flies and the appearance of other pests.

, Look along the length of the bottom of the backbone to find the kidney. It should be dark colored and span much of the backbone.Cut along the length of the kidney with your knife and then scrape it away with your finger or a tool, like a spoon.When the kidney is cut, it’ll release a dark red colored fluid. This should be rinsed away after the kidney is removed.

, Fish can be stored with the head still attached, but it may be most space efficient for you to cut it off. Insert your knife into the initial cut made for the gills and firmly press down on it until the head is removed. Similarly, the dorsal fin can be left on the fish, but to remove it, grip the fin firmly and cut shallowly along the top of the fish to remove it.


After removing the head and fins, only the spine, meat, and skin should remain. Your fish is ready to be filleted and skinned or stored for later.
Although removing the head of the fish can make it easier to store, which can be especially useful when freezing a big catch, leaving the head of the fish attached will help prevent it from spoiling., Now that the cutting and gutting is done, rinse your fish thoroughly in cold water. Packed in ice, your trout should stay good up to two weeks. If kept frozen below freezing, your trout can last for roughly two months.If you plan on freezing fish, consider vacuum sealing it first. This will protect the fish from freezer burn and can increase its shelf life up to three or four months.Double wrap fish stored in the refrigerator with plastic bags. Squeeze excess air from the bags before refrigerating. This can prevent a fishy odor from developing in your refrigerator.

, Insert your knife into the gap directly behind the gills (or where the gills were). Cut toward the backbone of the fish until you reach it. Use moderate force when cutting to prevent cutting through the backbone, which will serve as a guide for your knife.


Once you have reached the backbone, keep your knife inserted in the fish in preparation for the following cut.Fish can be filleted and skinned without being cleaned first. However, to prevent accidentally piercing the entrails, clean the fish first.If you decide to clean your fish before filleting and skinning it, leave the head on the fish so you have somewhere to hold onto later.

, Turn the blade of your knife toward the tail of the fish. Run the knife along the backbone and through the ribs until you reach the tail. Stop your cut at the tail, which you should leave on to make skinning the fish later easier.


This same cut, into the gills, along the backbone, and down to the tail should be repeated on the opposite side of the fish.
Hold the fish by the head while doing this. In some cases, you may be able to hook a finger around the jaw of the fish for a superior grip., Open the gutted fish so the meat is accessible. The meat will still have bones from the rib cage in it. Use your knife to cut out large masses of bones and your fingers to pick out what remains.Use gentle, firm movements when removing the rib cage. You may be able to pull most of the bones out as part of a single connected piece.

, Lay your fillets on a flat surface with the skin facing downward. Insert your knife into the meat about a half inch (1.27 cm) away from the tail. Hold the knife at an angle to the skin while gripping the tail firmly, then cut the meat free of the skin. The knife should run along the skin but not cut through it.In some regions or when crossing state/country lines, you may be required to leave a patch of skin on the fish so it can be identified and checked against your fishing permit.

Take note of the best seasons to catch white sea bass.,
Obtain the right bait.,
Attach the line, hook, and other accessories to your fishing pole.

,
Use a white iron jig in combination with 2 live squid for your first attempt.,
Use a medium-sized mackerel if the previous bait didn't work.,
Let your iron jig or live bait go deep into the water if the previous 2 steps didn't work.",How to Catch White Sea Bass," Starting around March, white sea bass are abundant near Catalina Island, San Clemente Island, and other nearby islands in California. Summer is the best season for fishing for sea bass in Southern California, but it can be caught into the fall and winter months. However, most people focus on other types of game fish during the cooler months.;
, White sea bass are very selective when it comes to what they will bite. Early spring white sea bass are typically caught with live or freshly dead squid. White sea bass caught in the summer or later months are not as picky and can be caught on almost any bait or jig.

,, White sea bass enjoy larger amounts of food, and the 2-squid combination is hard for them to resist. This kind of bait oftentimes attracts larger white sea bass, so make sure you are using a line that can hold at least 40 pounds (18 kg).

, Using larger bait will prevent smaller fish from attacking your bait while attracting the white sea bass. Let the mackerel swim freely, and keep a close eye on it. Once the white sea bass is hooked, start reeling it in.

, This technique works best when attempting to fish for white sea bass during the spring and early summer months. You want to get the attention of the barracuda, which are often followed by the white sea bass. Mackerel works well in this situation because the barracuda will typically not try to feed on it. If a recently-caught white sea bass happens to swim by, this can be an opportunity to catch it in its weakened state.

Put some baits into their target zone.,
Use the right colors.,
Kick the throttles up a notch.,
Rig up your wahoo baits with several feet of single-strand 80 to 120 test wire leader.,
Watch all of your rod tips closely.",How to Catch Wahoo," Wahoo like to cruise sub-surface, especially around flotsam and weedlines, and attack fish from below. Using planers or downriggers, set your offerings 20’ to 35’ below the surface. Wahoo sharpies also set monel or stainless lines weighted down with five to six pound sash weights, run directly from the rod tip of an 80 or 120 class bent-butt rod. Once your lines are set look for anything floating on the surface that could hold bait, and troll around or along it.;
, Wahoo are very color-specific in their preferences. The usual offshore trolling combinations like blues, pinks, and whites, are not usually the best ‘hoo choices. Instead, these fish gravitate towards red/black and purple/black combinations. Rig large ballyhoo behind rubber skirts in these color patterns, and they’ll attack.

, Wahoo are speedsters, and they like to attack fast baits. Don’t be afraid to troll at eight, nine, or even 10 knots—they won’t have any trouble catching up. Trolling at these fast speeds also allows you to cover a lot of ground. When you catch one wahoo, however, don’t continue on trolling aimlessly along. While it’s true that these fish don’t travel in large schools, they do gravitate towards the same areas. So after catching one work the immediate area thoroughly, before moving on.

, Mono doesn’t stand a chance with these beasts, and even when using circle hooks (which usually snag the fish in the corner of the jaw) they almost always escape if there’s no wire on the line.

, If you see one take a sudden dip and then spring back up, drop the reel into freespool and allow the bait to sink for a few seconds. Then thumb the spool and jig the line once or twice. Wahoo like to chop their prey in half, eat one end, then circle back and eat the other. Often they’ll bite a ballyhoo off just behind the hook. So if you act fast and give it a drop-back, the wahoo will often turn around and come back for more.

Fish in the spring.,
Catch walleye in the summer.,
Try fishing in the fall.",How to Catch Walleye2," Walleye fish are found in different areas depending on the season and type of location. Walleye change their habits based on their spawning schedules. In spring, you can find walleye along sandy shallow areas 3-10 feet from the shore of lakes and rivers. Fish at a depth of about 3-8 feet, depending on the depth of the body of water. You can also find them in the river current. Look for sand near rocky embankments, tree stumps, or other objects in the water. Walleye spawn near these areas, especially in early spring.


You are most likely going to catch smaller males near the spawning beds during this time of year. Females go farther down to hide from the sun and other fish. If you want to catch larger females, you need to fish a little deeper, 10-15 feet into the water.
Walleye are school fish, so they travel in groups. Once you catch one walleye, you are likely to catch another., Once the weather and water start to warm up, walleye go deeper into the water or hide in thick weeds. You can also look for islands with gravel patches, rocky drop offs, or areas near the mouth of a river. During the summer, especially when it gets really hot, the walleye will most likely be found 15-35 feet deep. They only come to the shoreline at night to feed.


Some of the smaller walleye will be in shallower areas, usually the smaller males., Fishing for walleye in the fall can be frustrating, but it can be done. Due to the decrease in temperature and the dying vegetation in the water, walleye move away from the shoreline and go deeper into the water. Look upstream around deep pools or back moving currents if you are fishing for walleye in rivers. In lakes, walleye go into the middle areas far away from shore and stay around 10-25 feet deep.


If you are fishing in lakes, you may need a depth finder to help you locate where the walleye are congregating.
Nights during the fall bring large female walleye out of the water. Between 10:00 pm and 3:00 am, walleye can be found along rocky shoals around 2-3 feet deep.Although you can fish for walleye in the winter, the fish are mostly inactive. It is much harder to catch them this time of year. Considering there is a great population of them in the northern United States as well, winter can get extremely harsh. This is especially the case in parts of Canada and along the great lakes.

Working the line.,
Hook the walleye.,
Troll for walleye.,
Be patient.",How to Catch Walleye3," Bait your hook or jig with your chosen bait. Then cast your line. Let the hook or lure sink to the bottom of the river or lake. Once it is at the bottom, you need to retrieve your hook. You can work your line in two main ways, slow retrieval and fast retrieval. The speed that you do this will depend on the time of year. To retrieve your hook, pull back on the fishing rod. Slowly lay your rod back straight, pulling in the line as it sinks to keep it taut. Repeat until you have reeled the line all the way in.


In those times when walleye are slower, such as late summer, fall, and during the middle of the day, use slow retrieval. When you pull back on your rod, do so slowly, making the jig or hook move slowly through the water to entice the walleye.
In spring and early summer when the walleye are more aggressive, use fast retrieval. Pull your rod back quickly, making the jig or bait zoom through the water. This will entice the more aggressive walleye to chase after your hook.
Since walleye are known to be near shorelines, you can fish for them from the bank of lakes and rivers. Cast the line into the lake or river, aiming for the areas 3-10 feet from the shore where the walleye are most active., When you feel something tug on your line, a walleye might be biting on your hook. When you feel this, pull firmly back on your rod. This is called setting your hook. This will pull the hook into the lip of the walleye and secure it on your line. Reel your line it to bring your fish out of the water.You can use a net to grab the fish once it is reeled in or do it by hand. If you are doing it by hand, watch out for the walleye's back fins. They are sharp and will cut you if you are not careful.
You may need a pair of pliers to get the hook out of the walleye's mouth. Have them on hand just in case the hook gets stuck.

, You can catch a walleye in a boat using the method known as trolling. On your boat, cast your trolling rods off the back of your boat and let the line sink. Then, using a trolling motor, drive slowly around the lake or river. Allow your lines to stay behind you. The lures or baited hooks will follow along behind the boat to entice the walleye. This is especially good for off seasons such as fall and winter., Walleye can be difficult to find, especially in the middle of the day, during hot weather, and once fall hits. Keep looking for areas where they might be and keep casting. If you are having a hard time finding an area that have a concentration of walleye, check the fish and game website for your area. There are surveys that explain the density of certain kinds of fish in different bodies of water. Look for the area that has the largest concentration of walleye and try your luck."

Use the clinch knot as your go-to fishing knot.,
Insert the line.,
Wrap the line.,
Make the knot.,
Pull it tight.,
Clip off the excess line above the knot.",How to Tie a Fishing Knot1," The clinch knot is probably the most popular fishing knot. That's because it's simple to tie, easy to remember, and holds its weight in durability. Use the clinch line for everyday fishing knots.






;
, Thread the end of the fishing line through the eye of the hook.








, Wrap the end of the line around the line (going back to the reel) four to six times.








, Pass the end of the line through the loop that you created in step one.









Improve the clinch knot by feeding the line through the loop that was created in the last step. This is called an ""improved clinch knot.""

, A little moisture here helps a lot. Wet it in your mouth to provide some lubrication.








, Leave only about 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) or so.

Wear whatever you find comfortable; there is no hiking dress code.,
Buy a titanium or aluminum pot with a Teflon non-stick surface.,
Bring a hand-held flashlight or a headlamp, for hands-free use.

,
Bring tinder to start a fire.,
When packing your backpack, place heavy items, such as water, camp stove and fuel, tent poles and stakes, and food near the bottom of your pack and close to your back.",How to Pack for a Backpacking Trip," Don't leave things out and think you will remember what you needed. Include everything that you will need, as well as what you might need.;
, Instead of bringing an extra heavy duty flashlight, bring a second set of batteries.

, Whether you buy one or borrow one, adjust it for your body. Fully loaded, nearly all of the weight should be on your hips and sacrum. The shoulder straps are mostly there to keep the pack vertical and close to you.

, Avoid excess raw meats, especially on long trips. Pack calorie dense food, but try to eat from a variety of food groups. Eat a lot of carbohydrates and protein. Since you'll sweat a lot, make sure you get sufficient salt. Most food packaging is bulkier than necessary and less waterproof than you'll prefer. Before you go, divide up your food and repackage it into zip-top bags.


Consider the following foods: oatmeal, Pop-Tarts, granola bars, nuts, and dried fruit for breakfast; bagels, hard cheese, crackers, peanut butter, summer sausage, raisins, nuts, and apples for lunch; and pasta, macaroni and cheese, couscous, instant black beans and rice, instant soup, Ramen, and quesadillas for dinner. Don't forget dessert--pudding or cookies are lovely.

, Avoid excess, it will add weight. A two person tent is sufficient for two people; do not be tempted to buy a larger one. Bring a sleeping bag and a ground cushion to insulate you from the ground to keep you warm. If you don't want to bring a pillow, stuff a sack with spare clothing at night.


Borrow a tent if you can. Make sure it has a rain fly and a ground cloth. Something small and lightweight is preferable. You don't need more floor space than your bodies will take up for sleeping since you'll keep your pack outside. If you are going somewhere rocky, bring a tent that stands up on its own, unstaked. It can be hard to find good places to put stakes.

, 64oz (~2 L) might be sufficient for a cool day, but more, up to 200oz (~7 L), might be required in arid regions. Water should be available at your campsite or from natural sources such as streams and lakes. Use water purification tablets or filters in natural water, no matter how clear it looks. Make sure water sources are reliable. Some may be dry during droughts or in summer months. Call the park rangers for the area to ask if you are in doubt.

, Bring rain gear for rainy days (a poncho just doesn't cut it for backpacking; invest in a rain suit consisting of a jacket and pants). Hiking boots protect your feet and provide ankle support. Buy heavy wool or synthetic socks to wear with them, and consider sock liners (thin socks underneath the wool socks made of polypropylene or nylon) to prevent 99% of blisters; no cotton! In cool or rainy regions, cotton kills! It wicks moisture, is slow to dry, and provides little insulation. Polar fleece, polypropylene, olefin, Thermax, and CoolMax are among the suitable materials for outdoor wear.

, Make sure they have handles, preferably plasticized to prevent burning your hands or invest in a pan gripper. Ensure the pot is large enough for one-pot cooking .

,, An excellent tinder is dryer lint. Cotton balls and newspapers work, but the ultimate is dryer lint rubbed with Vaseline or Petroleum Jelly. These will start easily and burn very intensely. Take fire-starters that create sparks and fire without a match and a large supply of waterproof matches. To make waterproof matches, dip strike-anywhere matches in melted candle wax. Disposable cigarette lighters are also OK.

, Place the lightest items, such as fleece, sleeping pad, and rain/wind gear at the top, away from your back. Place your bulky sleeping bag at the very bottom of your pack, close to your back as well. Some backpacks are made with a special pocket for your sleeping bag. Beware that these can allow water to enter through the zip so ensure your bag is well protected from getting wet if there is a possibility of this. Medium-weight items, such as utensils, clothing, lighter foods, and your tent body and fly can either go near the top away from your back, or near the bottom close to your back. In the outside pockets, place miscellaneous items that you might need to access quickly: map, compass, knife, flashlight, fire starters/matches, etc. Make sure you pack a trash bag or two for garbage at your campsites and wet clothing.


Pack clothing inside a garbage bag with the top folded over. Put the heaviest items closer to the small of your back and near the top. Keep your rain gear, snacks, and whistle easily available. Use zip-top bags and stuff sacks liberally. Keep all of your aromatic items in one or two places so that you don't forget any when you need to place them in the bear keg/bag.

Use worms and mealworms when in doubt.,
Use minnow as a general purpose bait fish or specialize with another variety.,
Hook certain species with crayfish.,
Use shrimp when saltwater fishing near the shore.,
Bait freshwater fish with insects.",How to Bait a Fishing Hook1," This bait is widely used in many types of fishing. Use earthworms or manure worms in freshwater and bloodworms or sandworms in saltwater. Mealworms and other live grubs are usually used for trout or bass.


Pierce through several smaller worms or cut up worm halves to hide the hook in a mass of wriggling worms. Some hooks come with smaller hooks attached to the side for this purpose.
For large worms, thread a single worm along the hook until the hook is mostly or completely hidden.
For very large worms, pierce the hook through several points of the body. Leave a length at the end to wriggle and attract fish.;
, Many fish feed on minnow, but make sure you pick a size appropriate for your target fish to eat. Ask at the bait shop what kind of local fish your target eats, too.


If you are dragging the bait behind you in a moving boat (trolling), hook the fish under its jaw and exit through the top, or just through its upper jaw for especially large bait fish. Alternatively, you can hook it through both nostrils. Any of these hook methods will maximize the fish's ability to swim with a natural motion to attract predator fish.For fishing while still or moving slowly, hook the bait fish on its back just in front of the dorsal fin. Hook it underneath the spine to avoid paralyzing it. This forces the fish to swim more frantically and head-downwards, attracting attention. You can fine tune the depth by placing it further ahead of the dorsal fin; this causes it to swim at a shallower downward angle.
If you are freelining (fishing while stationary, using no floats or weights), you can hook the bait near the tail to make it swim forward. To force it to swim downward instead, hook into the mouth and exit through the gills., Fish that are attracted to crayfish bait include smallmouth bass, catfish, and walleye.


Thread the hook shallowly through the back or front of the crayfish, pushing it out again on the same side. Don't go any deeper than necessary to get under the main shell segment, or you may kill the crayfish.
Alternatively, thread the hook through the meaty tail. This can hide most of the hook and will not hit any of the crayfish's vital organs. Start at the end of the tail and push the hook out just before the body.

, Shrimp are a common, cheap bait that many inshore fish varieties feed on, including redfish, jacks, and grouper.These are similar in anatomy to crayfish, but you may need to use a thinner hook for small varieties.


Hook shallowly through the body or through the meat of the tail.
Remove a few segments of shell so the shrimp scent is stronger.

, During the summer when insects are plentiful, fishermen can simply catch adults from the ground or young nymphs from under the water surface to guarantee bait that's part of the local fish diet. Trout are especially attracted to insects.Insects should be handled carefully, as they area easily killed while baiting.
Tie a flexible thin wire to the shank of the hook, then wrap it carefully around the insect to affix it to the hooked section.
If you can't affix it with wire, hook through the rear section of the body. The vital organs are mostly in the front and should be avoided. It doesn't matter which direction the insect is facing.

Use fish pieces to attract fish that hunt by scent.,
Bait with crayfish tail in freshwater or brackish water and shrimp tail in saltwater.,
Customize doughballs to your fish species.,
Use local clam and other soft meat.,
Buy artificial bait for the right depth.",How to Bait a Fishing Hook2," This includes many saltwater fish such as sea trout and bluefish, as well as freshwater bottom feeders such as carp and catfish.If you are fishing from one spot (still fishing), cut the fish into chunks thick enough to hide most of the hook.
If you are dragging the fishing line behind a moving boat (trolling), cut the fish into long, thin V-shaped strips. Pierce the hook through the thicker end so the moving strip imitates a swimming fish.

, Any fish that hunts crayfish, such as pike or catfish, can be attracted by a severed tail with the hook pushed along the length of the meaty center. The same hooking process can be used to attract shoreline fish with a shrimp tail bait.

, Commercial doughball paste can be purchased in labeled varieties that attract bass, trout, or another specific species. You can also make your own by boiling hot water, flour, cornmeal, and molasses for a few minutes and letting it cool. Fishermen add anything from cheese to garlic to this recipe in their efforts to attract an individual fish species.


Form the paste into a ball over the entire hook. Press it into place so the hook is hidden completely. Some hooks include wire springs to help keep the doughball in place.

, Shellfish are great for attracting fish in their native area. Clams, mussels, liver, and other soft meat should be left out in the sun to harden before use, or else frozen beforehand and used when partially thawed.


Once the meat is hardened, pierce the hook through it in as many different places as possible. Hide the end of the hook in the meat.
If it still won't adhere to the hook or you suspect a fish could peel it right off, use fine thread or wire to tie it on.

, You can find artificial lures that sink, float, or stay just under the surface. In addition to customizing for your fish's habits, you can find artificial bait intended to attract a specific species by smell or appearance.


In order to hook a standard artificial ""grub,"" thread the hook through the mouth of the bait until the front reaches the eye of the hook. Push the end of the hook out through the grub's stomach.

Learn how to use a bridle.,
Use thick, synthetic fishing line or rigging floss.,
Tie the ends of the line together.,
Pull the knot as tightly as you can.,
Use a lighter to melt the line ends (optional).,
Prepare to tie your bridle to the fishing hook.,
Pass the loop end up over the fishing hook and underneath the knot.,
Clinch it down tightly.,
Fasten the bridle in place.,
Keep it ready for attachment to live bait.",How to Bait a Fishing Hook3," A bridle is tied between the hook and the bait fish in order to keep the bait fish alive for a long time and to increase the chance of a good hook, since it is difficult to pull the bridle off.


Bridling is most often used in saltwater fishing to catch larger fish, since the proportionally larger bait fish is less replaceable and more easily manipulated.

, A thick cord of Dacron (also called Terylene or Lavsan outside the U.S.) works well.Don't use thin cord as this can cut right through the bait fish.

, Make a loop with 1/4"" to 1/2"" (6mm to 12mm) ends, or ""tags"", sticking out.

, Yank both ends of the loop to fasten the knot as tight as possible without pulling the tags through.

, Hold the lighter flame over the two ends until they are melted enough that they cannot pass through the knot.


Pull your loop as hard as you can to make sure it doesn't come apart.

, Place the fishing hook on top of your bridle, resting on a flat surface. Follow the next few steps to secure the two together if you don't know how to tie a ""cow hitch"".


The knot end should be positioned a short distance above the bottom of the hook's ""J"" shape (or the base of the ""O"" for a circle hook), with the rest of the bridle passing underneath the hook and extending below the J.

, It should pass above the J bend of the fishing hook and between the two sides of line next to the knot end.

, Pull the slack out of the line so it is tight against the J bend of the fishing hook.

, Loop the side nearest to the hook end over the hook point and pull it tight against the knot. This keeps it from sliding along the hook.


Make a second ""hitch"" like this if you want to make it extra secure.

, Many fishermen prepare bridles and hooks of several sizes so they are prepared for any size bait fish they happen to catch. You can also bring your own in a bait tank or practice on dead bait to get the hang of it.

"
"
Prepare your bridle in advance.,
Put a crochet hook through the live bait.,
Attach the bridle and draw it back through.,
Put the hook point through the loop on the opposite side of the fish.,
Twist the hook repeatedly.,
Pass the hook through the gap between the fish and the twists.,
Let out some fishing line and carefully put the bait in the water.",How to Bait a Fishing Hook4," If the live bait needs to remain alive and natural looking for as long as possible, you can attach it with a secure bridle rather than a damaging hook.


Have a more experienced fisher make a bridle for you, or follow the instructions for Making a Bridle to create your own.

, You can do this through the eye sockets above or in front of the eyes (not through them), or through a hole in its back near the head.You can use an open eye live bait needle instead of a crochet needle.

, Use the end of the needle to catch the loop end of the bridle and draw it through the fish.


Keep hold of the loop so the fish's wriggling doesn't pull it back out again.

, You should now be able to let go of the line and just keep hold the hook and fish.

, This takes up slack in the line and brings the hook closer to the fish. Do this until there's only a small gap between the fish's head and the twists in the line.

, Thread the hook point between the two sides of the loop, just above the fish's head.

, If the bridle rig was made correctly, you should be able to use your live bait for hours without it escaping or dying. But let's hope you catch something before then!

Take at least 2 slices of bread.,
Turn on the water in your sink.

,
Put a slice of bread under the water and start rolling the slice of bread into a ball.

,
Repeat step 3 for all the slices of bread you want for fishing bait.

,
Go to your fishing spot with the balls of bread inside a plastic bag and your fishing gear.

,
Break off a piece of bread that is not much bigger than a large fly.

,
Put that little piece of bread on your hook and start fishing!

Select the right kind of backpack from a reputable company, such as Lowe Alpine or North Face.,
Create a list of what you think you'll need for an international backpacking trip.,
Pack a backpack with the following clothing items:


Two pairs of lightweight pants made of cotton or another fabric that dries quickly.,
Take two pairs of shoes: walking shoes and relaxing shoes.,
Choose weather-appropriate gear based on your location.,
Use see-through packing cubes for packing clothing.,
Choose a sturdy freezer zip-lock type of bag or a PVC mesh bag to pack toiletries in.,
Remember a good fast-drying towel.,
Save space when you pack a backpack with selected travel information.,
Bring a digital camera, charger and a high-capacity memory card.

,
Carry mosquito repellent.,
Opt for a small first aid kit with pain relievers, band-aids, tweezers, antibiotic cream, something for upset stomachs and hydrocortisone cream for bug bites.

,
Set aside camping type equipment if a backpacking trip will often take you away from towns.,
Think about small extras that might come in handy.,
Keep money and important papers in a money belt strapped to your waist and worn under your shirt.

",How to Pack for an International Backpacking Trip," Features to look for are:


Comfortable back and hip straps are a necessity. Try it on to check.
Zipper pockets that can be secured with a small lock.
A backpack on the light side that provides about 20% of space for maneuvering.;
,


Experienced backpackers tell you to gather everything you think you'll need and then get rid of half of it.
Whether you're going to backpack Europe, Asia, or South America, an important question that determines what makes the list to pack a backpack with is ""can I buy it local.""

, Jeans are bulky and take up a lot of room. If you think you can't live without them, wear them on the plane trips. If you backpack Europe, you'll notice the only time you see people in shorts are if they're American tourists or you're at a beach. If you must bring shorts, consider pants with zip-off legs.
Two to three shirts, including one long-sleeve shirt when you pack a backpack. If you bring a t-shirt and polo, you can wear them together when the temperature drops.
Females might want to replace one pair of pants with a longish skirt in order to be admitted into historical churches that have dress codes and to limit unwanted attention for showing too much skin in many Asian locations.






Take 3-to-6 pairs of underwear for an international backpacking trip. Fast drying moisture-wicking brands like Under Armour make it easy to wash out underwear at night.
Socks.
A small clothesline and sewing kit can be lifesavers on an international backpacking trip.

,


Light trail-running shoes make good walking shoes for a backpacking trip.
If you're going to a warm location, take flip flops for relaxing and wearing into public showers.
Some people prefer to relax with slippers on cold international backpacking trips.

,


If there's a possibility of rain, go with a hooded water-resistant windbreaker. Backpackers who plan on sleeping on the ground may prefer a poncho that can double as something to sleep on. A collapsible umbrella is another option.
Pack lightweight Microfleece for cool days or nights. But, for the most part, you'll want to layer clothing for warmth.

, They keep your pack organized and packed tightly.

, Don't forget:


Soap. Not all hotels provide soap.
Tissue packets in case you end up somewhere without toilet paper.
Shampoo, deodorant, toothpaste and razors are all available whether you backpack Europe or other locations.

, Check with camping or swimming outlets.

,


Make copies or rip out pages that you need. Then staple or bind the pages. This allows much more room than taking an entire guidebook or two.

,,


Keep repellent in a separate pocket or in a plastic bag to keep it from leaking onto clothes.
Pack a compact mosquito net if international backpacking takes you to sub-Saharan Africa.

,, Some items you might want to consider are:


Lightweight sleeping bag.
Fork/spoon tool combination.
Bowl.

, Experienced backpackers suggest:


Small LED flashlight.
Adapter if an international backpacking trip takes you to locations with different electrical currents and outlets.
Trip journal.
Tiny lock for locking backpack zippers shut. If you check your backpack at the airport, make certain the lock is approved by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) so they can inspect your backpack without damaging it.

Choose tackle appropriate to the species you're fishing for.,
Choose the right lure color.,
Connect your line to the lure to maximize its action.,
Keep your weight well away from the lure if using a sinker.,
Try various retrieves.",How to Use Rapala Lures," Rapalas and other thin minnows can be used to catch a number of different species, so the fish you're fishing for should be your major consideration in choosing which size of Rapala to use and what rod, reel, and line to use with it.


Choose smaller-sized thin minnows for bluegill, crappie, and smaller species of bass and trout. Fish them with light to ultralight tackle, using a spinning or spincast reel and lines from 6 to 10-lb. test (3 to 5 kg class). (You may also want to choose smaller thin minnows and lighter line when fishing in clear water.)
Choose larger-sized thin minnows for larger fish species, such as largemouth bass, walleye, and pike. You can use a spinning, spincast, or baitcast reel filled with at least 10-lb. test (5 kg class) line or higher.
Consider a graphite rod to help you feel the lure's action better as you retrieve, as well as the sinker's contacting the bottom when using the 3-way sinker rig described in a following step.;
, Rapalas are available in a variety of colors and patterns, mimicking various baitfish, as well as simple ""dark on top, light on the bottom"" patterns. Which type you select depends on which color you have the most confidence in.


The rule-of-thumb most anglers use is ""bright day, clear water, light-colored lure; dark day, cloudy water, dark-colored lure."" As with most fishing ""rules,"" there are exceptions.
Some fishermen prefer the most fish-like patterns they can find, particularly in clear-water conditions and less natural, but highly visible, patterns in cloudy water.

, There are several ways to connect a Rapala to your line:


Snap or snap swivel. A snap lets you change lures faster than cutting and retying your line; a rounded snap allows for greater freedom of movement than a pointed one. However, many fishermen dislike using a snap swivel with a Rapala, as the swivel's weight can throw off the lure's wobbling action caused by its slightly concave lip. If you do use a snap or snap swivel, use the smallest you can.
Split ring. A split ring is lighter than a snap swivel and allows for freedom of movement, but you'll need to spread it apart with your fingers or special pliers to change lures if you don't want to cut your line and re-tie.
Loop knot. Many anglers prefer tying thin minnows onto their lines with a loop knot, as the loop allows for greater freedom of movement and doesn't weight the line like a snap swivel does. You'll have to cut and re-tie the line to change lures, however, and some loop knots will slide next to the eye when a fish strikes the lure.
Direct knot. Some fishermen prefer to tie a Rapala to their line with a knot that rests directly against the lure's eye, such as an improved clinch, Palomar, Trilene, or uni-knot.

, Just as a large snap swivel will interfere with the Rapala Original Floater's action, putting your sinker too close to the lure will similarly inhibit it. How you fish the Rapala will determine what sinker to use, if any.


To fish topwater or in shallow water, you don't need a sinker at all. The Rapala Original Floater is designed to dive to a depth of 2 to 6 feet (0.6 to 1.8 m) on its own.
To go deeper when casting into medium depths, you can put a split shot 12 to 24 inches (0.3 to 0.6 m) ahead of your line. (The lighter the line you use, the lighter the split shot you can use to weight your lure.)
To cast or troll in deep water, use a three-way swivel rig. Attach one swivel ring to your line and your lure to another swivel ring using 7 feet (2.1 m) of either monofilament or special fluorocarbon leader. Attach 3 feet (0.9 m) of line to the third ring, with a 3-ounce (85 g) bell or dipsey sinker at the other end.

, Rapala and other thin minnows can be retrieved a number of ways. How you've rigged the lure to your line has some impact on how you can retrieve, but you can try any of the retrieves described below:


Fish topwater by casting the lure and letting the ripples dissipate, then twitch the lure to simulate a wounded minnow struggling on the surface. You can also let the lure drift with the current to reach pockets with overhanging limbs that would catch the lure if cast to directly.
Crank the Rapala in with a steady retrieve. Use this technique with no sinker or with either of the weighting options described above.
Crank the Rapala in for a few seconds, pause briefly, then crank again. Repeat the pauses. This will also simulate a wounded minnow. You can also use this retrieve with or without a sinker.
Troll the lure behind your boat at a steady speed. This method is best used with the 3-way sinker rig in deeper water, but you can also troll in shallower water with split shot for weight. Use a speed of about 1 to 2 mph (1.6 to 3.2 km/hour), slower if using a jointed thin minnow.

Choose a backpack.,
Gather necessary supplies.,
Lay out your supplies by weight.,
Consolidate items wherever possible.,
Pack the lightest items at the bottom and the heaviest close to your back.,
Keep essential items immediately accessible.,
Attach external items.,
Check the pack to see how it feels.,
Use stuff sacks to pack your food, but not your softer items.,
Pack bear canisters efficiently.,
Get a pack cover to protect your backpack.",How to Pack a Hiking Backpack," When you're hiking, you'll appreciate having the lightest possible pack on your back. Choose the smallest and lightest backpack you can find that will hold all the supplies you need for your journey. If you're just going for a long day hike, you can get away with a smaller pack, but for an overnight backpacking trip you'll need a pack that will fit sleeping gear like a sleeping bag and tent, as well as plenty of extra food and water.


Backpack capacities are measured in liters, and you'll see backpacks for sale that can hold anywhere between 25 and 90. The average capacity for a day hike backpack is 25 to 40 liters (6.6 to 10.6 US gal), and the average for a hike that's five days or longer is 65 to 90.Aside from the length of your trip, the other variable involved in choosing a backpack volume is the season in which you'll be hiking. You'll need a larger backpack for hiking during winter months, during which you'll need to carry heavier clothing and other extras.
Most backpacks are manufactured with internal frames that help support the weight, though you can still find a few external-frame backpacks designed to bear the very heaviest loads In any case, rather than just carrying a standard school backpack, look for one especially made to carry weight while hiking for optimum comfort.;
, When it comes to hiking you'll want to bring along only essential items. It might be tempting to bring along your camera, a journal, and your favorite pillow, but bringing unnecessary extras will weigh you down. Pack only as much as you need for the hike you're doing. Do research to find out what you should bring for the particular hike you're doing, taking into account how strenuous the hike will be, the number of nights you'll be sleeping out and the weather.


Consider springing for the lightest yet sturdiest gear possible, especially if you're going for a longer hike. For example, if you need to bring along a sleeping bag, you might want to get an extremely lightweight and compact bag weighing only a few pounds instead of bringing along a big, fluffy bag that will take up a lot of space and weigh you down. But, you should consider the weather, climate and terrain of where you'll be hiking. Sometimes, you may need bulkier items.
Wherever possible, pare down. Instead of bringing along a box of granola bars, remove them from the box and carry them in a plastic bag. Instead of bringing a heavy camera, consider using your mobile device's camera. Some people even pare down by cutting off their toothbrush handles and snapping their combs in half.

, Spread out everything you're bringing and organize it into piles according to the weight of the items. Have a pile for heavy items, medium-weight items and small items. Organizing your items in this way will help you pack everything properly to ensure your hike will be as comfortable as possible.


Light items include your sleeping bag, light clothing, and other light nighttime supplies.
Medium items include heavier clothing, your first aid kit and light food items.
Heavy items include heavier food items, cooking supplies, water, your flashlight, and heavy gear.

, It's important to maximize space as much as possible and concentrate the weight. Consolidating items will prevent them from loosely traveling around your backpack. Your backpack will stay better organized and well-weighted if you take the time pack flexible into extra spaces.


For example, if you have a small cooking pot, fill it up before you pack it. Stuff it with food supplies, or store your extra pair of socks there. Maximize every little bit of space you can.
Pack small items that you use at the same time in the same place. For example, pack your toiletries in one lightweight bag to keep them all together.
This is a good opportunity to eliminate items that are taking up too much space. If you have an item that you can't easily pack in with the other items, because it's an awkward size or made of inflexible material, you might want to leave it behind.

, Distributing the weight so that the lightest items are at the bottom, he heaviest items are centered between your shoulder blades and the medium items are stashed around them is the best way to keep your back healthy. If you pack the heavy items first, you'll be putting a lot more strain on your back. Packing the heavier items right along your upper spine situates the weight of the pack on your hips, rather than in a place where it would cause injury.If you're camping overnight, pack your sleeping bag and other light sleep-related items first. On top of those, pack your changes of clothing, extra socks, extra gloves and so on.
Pack the heaviest items: your water, your flashlight, your heavy cooking supplies and so on. These should be centered between your shoulder blades right up against your back.
Then pack medium-weight cooking supplies, food supplies, your first aid kit, and other medium-weight items so that they surround the other items and stabilize your pack.Wrap flexible items like tarps or clothing around the heavier times to keep them from shifting as you walk.

, There are a few items that you'll need to have handy, so even if they're light, they should go on top or in the outer pockets. You'll want food and water handy, as well as your map, GPS, flashlight, and a few first aid items you anticipate needing. Pack these items carefully so you know just where they are when you need them.


After a few days on the trail, you'll get a better sense of what you need to be accessible and what you don't. Rearrange your pack as you go so that it's packed to be as convenient and comfortable as possible.

, If the gear you have won't fit in your backpack, you can attach it externally by strapping it to the top, bottom or sides of your pack. For example, you might want to attach your tent poles to the top of your backpack, or hang your water bottle from the side. If you choose to attach items externally, there are a few things to keep in mind:


Attach as few external items as possible. It's better to pack everything you can, since as you hike you'll end up catching your gear against trees and other obstructions. Keeping it contained makes for a more comfortable walk.
Follow the rules for weight distribution. For example, attach your heavy tent or walking poles to the top of the pack, not the bottom.

, Lift the pack onto your body and tighten the compression straps to a comfortable position. Walk around to see how it feels when you carry the pack. If you can walk around comfortable, and the pack feels compressed and secure, you're good to go.


If you feel things shifting around, remove the backpack and repack the items so they're more compressed and stable, then try again.
If the backpack feels tippy, remove it and repack it so the heavier items are centered between your shoulder blades right against your spine. They were probably too high in the pack before.
If it feels off balance, repack it and try to distribute the weight more evenly on either side.
If it's way too heavy, think about what you can leave behind. If you're walking with a group, see if someone else has room to bear some of your load.

, Stuff sacks are a popular gear item used to help keep backpacks organized. They're lightweight but durable sacks that come in really handy for keeping your food items separate from the rest of your pack. Many people fill one stuff sack with food they're not going to eat on the trail, and another one with toiletries. You could use stuff sacks to pack nearly anything, but seasoned hikers don't bother putting clothing into stuff sacks, since packing softer, flexible items around the heavier, more awkward items is a more efficient use of space., Bear canisters are smell-tight containers used to store food, deodorant, sunscreen, and other items that attract bears. They're mandatory to use in certain areas with high concentrations of bears. If you're hiking in a place that requires the use of bear canisters, it's important to pack your canister efficiently so it doesn't become an awkwardly-weighted item in your pack.


Don't use any items like clothes to fill the voids in a bear canister. You might use for example rain clothes or pack cover to fill up the space, but not anything that you are going to wear in camp. You do not want any bear attracting smells in your tent, like clothes that have been soaking in food scent an entire day.
The canister is likely to be heavy, so pack it as a heavy item between your shoulder blades and right next to your spine.
Pack a flexible item like a tarp or extra clothing around the canister so it doesn't move while you walk.

, This is a convenient and lightweight item that could save your backpack from getting soaked by rain or snow. It's a cover you attach over your backpack in inclement weather. When it's not raining or snowing, the packover is small and light enough to stuff into the top of your pack so you can easily access it when you need it.

Note which way your reel bail turns.,
Note which way the line is wound on the filler spool.,
Tie the end of the line to your reel spool.,
Begin reeling the line onto your reel spool.,
Check the line for twist after cranking a few times.,
Continue filling the reel spool to within 1/8 inch (3.2 mm) of its rim.,
Cut the line off the filler spool when finished.",How to Spool a Spinning Reel," Hold your empty reel the way it would be oriented on your fishing rod and turn the handle as you would when retrieving. Note the way the bail turns. This is the way the line will be spooled onto the reel; the opposite direction is the way the line will peel off the spool when you cast.


Spinning reels are designed to hang down from the rod, not rest above it like spincasting and baitcasting reels are. To hold the reel properly when it’s not mounted on the rod, wrap the fingers of your casting hand around the mounting bar and let the reel hang from that hand while reeling with your other hand.;
, You want to orient the filler spool so that line peels off it in the same direction in which your reel bail turns when you turn the reel handle, in other words, that it comes off the filler spool the same direction in which it winds onto the reel.

, Use either an arbor knot or a uni-knot.


If you wish, you can mount your reel on the rod and thread the line through the guides before attaching it to the rod.

, Turn the crank handle slowly with your cranking hand. You can add tension by passing the line between the fingers of your casting hand, by raising the rod slightly if your reel is mounted on the rod, or by both methods.


If you’re filling the reel by yourself, place the filler spool flat on the floor and let the line spool off it onto the reel.
If you have an assistant, have the assistant thread a pencil or dowel through the filler spool, holding it parallel to the direction of the reel spool. The assistant can apply finger pressure to the spool to supply additional tension to the line.

, If you’re taking up the line on the reel spool the same way it pays off the filler spool, you shouldn’t have twist. However, you should still let the line go slack to check for twist. If there is twist, the line will start un-spooling from the reel spool. You then have to peel off the line, flip the filler spool over, and start again.

, Your reel may have a tab or mark on its spool that lets you know when you’ve filled it to the proper amount.


If you under fill the reel, your casts will be shorter because of the friction of the line rubbing against the top flange of the reel spool.
If you overfill the reel, the line may absorb enough water when it gets wet to slip past the flange and cause a backlash when you cast., You may want to put a rubber band around the reel spool to keep the line in place if you’re not going to fish with the reel right away.

Enjoy your rig!",How to Tie a Carolina Rig," The first component that makes up the Carolina Rig is the hook.  The hook should be an off-set worm hook and the size should compliment the size of the bait that you will be using.;
, The only bait that you should use for the Carolina Rig is soft plastic bait.  It doesn't have to be any particular soft plastic bait, just one that has performed well for you in the past.

, The leader is the fishing line that is tied on from the hook to the swivel.  It should be about 12 to 48 inches long, dependent upon the distance the fish are staying from the bottom at that instance in time.  A fish finder can help determine that distance, but is not necessary if you want to use the good ole trial-and-error method.  If you find that the fish are about 18 inches form the bottom, then you make your leader 18 inches long.  Its that simple.  If you are ever unsure, 18 inches is a good rule of thumb length to use.

, The function of any swivel is the keep the line from twisting.  However, its main function on the Carolina Rig is to serve as a stop for the weight.  The only factors to consider when choosing a swivel is weight and stealth.  Therefore, it is best to use a brown colored swivel to make it invisible in the water and as light as you can for the fish you are trying to catch.  An 80 pound brown swivel is usually a good universal choice.

, Its main purpose is to drive the line to the bottom of the body of water you are fishing. A bullet weight works best and it should be about 3/4 oz. However, depending on conditions, such as shallow water or fast current, you may need to use a little lighter or a little heavier weight.

, The glass bead should be put on your main fishing line (line that goes from the swivel to your fishing pole) just below the weight and sit between the weight and the swivel.  It should have a hole through the center and simply just slide it onto the line.  The glass bead serves two purposes:


knocks against the weight causing a noise that attracts the fish
protects the knot tied onto the swivel form being damaged

, There are several different fishing knots, and all of them are sufficient to use. Just tie your favorite fishing knot.

,  With your Carolina Rig complete its time to go fishing and catch some fish.

Wrap the thread around the other side of the whip-finish tool and rotate it clock wise to create a triangle.

,
Tighten the thread until the tip of the triangle is on the fly head and rotate the entire tool around the head of the fly 4-6 times.

,
Tilt the tool until the thread slides off the end of the tool and pull the bobbin to tighten the thread.

,
Unhook the whip-finish tool from the thread and use the scissors to carefully cut the thread.

,
Place a small amount of head b on the head of the fly and use the dubbing needle to spread the glue around.

,
Put your new fly on your rod and whack ‘em and stack ‘em!",How to Tie a Wooly Bugger," Do not place the vise too high or too low on the bend or the vise and hook will not be able to support the weight of the fly.;
,, Be careful while wrapping so that the hook does not cut the thread!

, Wrap 5-6 times around. Make sure the marabou is wrapped tightly by allowing the bobbin to hang down. If the marabou is in tightly, it will stay in place as the bobbin hangs.

,,,,, You can overlap the thread in order to make the wrap more secure. Cut off the excess chenille. This is called tying off.

,,


You have now formed the body of the fly. The marabou fibers are the tail of the fly and can be left alone. You may trim them if you like but the best tail is a large and full so trimming may be unnecessary.

,, You don’t want your fly to fall apart!

, Hold the bobbin with you left hand to maintain tension.

Consider the kind of freshwater fishing you like to do.,
Consider how often you go fishing.,
Look for a durable tackle box.,
Look for a tackle box that helps you organize your tackle.,
Look for a water-resistant tackle box.,
Allow some room for expansion.,
Look at the manufacturer's guarantee.",How to Start Up a Freshwater Fishing Tackle Box1," The larger the tackle box, the more fishing tackle it can hold, but the larger the box, the bulkier it is, and the heavier it is to carry. A large tackle box is not practical if you do a lot of hiking and backpacking to your destination. Likewise, a small tackle box may not be practical on a long fishing trip where you can expect to encounter a number of different conditions.


If you normally wade into a lake or stream to fish, you'll want a small tackle box you can carry on your person, such as small metal or plastic box that slips into a pocket of your shirt or waders or one that clips to your belt. You may also have a larger tackle box on shore from which you trade out lures to the one you carry on your person or keep equipment for tying flies on location when trying to ""match the hatch.""
If you normally hike some distance to your fishing spots or fish in farm ponds, you'll also want a smaller tackle box. You may find a traditional single-tray or 2-tray box satisfactory, you may prefer the pocket or clip-on tackle boxes used by wading fishermen, or you may prefer a soft-side tackle box that can be carried over the shoulder.
If you normally fish from a boat, a larger tackle box may be called for, particularly when fishing for bass, walleye, or muskellunge, when you may want to carry a large selection of, or in the case of fishing for muskie, very large lures. Larger tackle boxes typically have at least 3 trays, and sometimes 2 sets of 3 trays each that open in either direction, and a large bottom to hold extra line, small reels, sinker boxes, spinnerbait racks, and other fishing equipment.
If you normally fly to your destination, such as to a remote lake in Canada, you want a tackle box large enough to hold your most important gear, but not large enough to require extra handling fees. It should also be sturdy enough and have a secure enough latching system to handle rough handling before and during the flight.
If most of your fishing is done from the bank or a lake or stream in a park or other public access area, you can get by with a 1- or 2-tray plastic or metal tackle box. This is also a good size tackle box for a first-time fisherman to buy; as you develop more specific fishing interests, you can consider a second tackle box that better serves those needs.;
, If you don't go fishing very often, you probably won't want to invest a lot of money in fishing tackle, or in a large tackle box. A 1- or 2-tray box could very well meet your needs under most circumstances.

, Whatever size of tackle box you decide to buy, look for a well-constructed unit that will stand up to the unintended abuse you'll put it to. If buying a traditional hard-case tackle box, look for a box made either of metal or high-impact plastic, such as ABS plastic. If buying a soft-case plastic box, look for one made of a sturdy material with well-stitched or welded seams.


The latch on a hard-case tackle box should also be secure enough to minimize the possibility of the box's accidentally popping open when you pick it up by the handle. The zipper on a soft-case tackle box should feature large, sturdy teeth that won't come out of the zipper.

, Your tackle box should have enough trays to handle the type of lures you use most often, keeping them separate so their hooks won't tangle together. You may want to have trays with adjustable dividers as well as various-sized compartments; if you fish with spinnerbaits, you may want to have a rack that suspends them vertically instead of laying them flat in a tray compartment.


If you fish with plastic worms, the trays should be made of a material that won't react with the soft plastic the worms are made of. (You shouldn't keep plastic worms and crankbaits in the same compartment for this reason.) You can also keep plastic worms in a small tackle box designed just for plastic worms that you can carry in the bottom of a larger tackle box.

, When closed, your tackle box should not permit water to enter it unless it falls into the water and sinks. This feature can be especially important if you do a lot of fishing in the rain or other foul weather conditions.

, As you get more into fishing, you will buy more fishing tackle and related equipment. Buying a slightly larger tackle box than you need right now, unless you normally hike to your fishing spots, will give you room to grow into the sport and give you room to carry a few non-tackle items, as well.

, The longer the manufacturer guarantees its tackle boxes for, the more reputable the company generally is and the better-constructed its tackle boxes are. Look for a warranty of at least 2 years; some manufacturers offer a lifetime warranty on their tackle boxes.

Eye: The part of the hook the line is threaded through and usually tied to.
Shank: The vertical part of the hook connected to the eye.
Bend: The curved part of the hook. Some hooks feature an offset bend, so that the business end of the hook does not run parallel to the shank.
Point: The sharp end of the hook designed to penetrate the fish’s mouth when it takes the bait.
Barb: A projection running diagonally backward from the point. It is designed to embed the hook in the fish’s mouth once the hook is set. Hooks designed for catch-and-release fishing either have no barb or have been smashed down with pliers to prevent the barb from catching.
Gap: The space between the hook point and shank.;
, Hooks are available as single, double, or treble hooks having 1, 2, or 3 points, respectively.


Single hooks are most commonly used in fishing with live bait like worms, minnows, and grubs. They are also used when fishing lures that simulate worms or grubs, as well as with spinnerbaits whose design resembles an open safety pin. Jig heads are molded and flies are tied around single hooks.
Double hooks can be used with some live bait when extra hooking power is required, and are also used with some lures as a second hook, such as large safety-pin spinnerbaits and some spoons.
Treble hooks are found on artificial lures such as spoons, French (inline) spinners, plugs, and crankbaits. They are also used with prepared baits such as marshmallows and catfish bait where the extra hook points are required to increase the likelihood of setting the hook.

, You’ll want to carry a variety of hook sizes with you. In general, you should never use a larger hook than necessary for the type of bait you’re fishing and the type of fish you’re trying to catch with it.


Number-only hook sizes range from 1 to 32. The larger the number, the smaller the hook.
Number-aught hook sizes range from 1/0 (read “one-aught”) to 19/0. For hooks numbered this way, the larger the number before the slash, the larger the hook. A 1/0 hook is larger than a number 1 hook.
For most freshwater bait fishing, you’ll want a range of hooks no broader than 5/0 or 6/0 to a number 10 or number 12, and probably no broader than 1/0 to number 8.

, Single-point hooks offer the most variety in terms of eye, shank, bend, point, and gap. Each variation is designed for a particular type of fishing or bait.


Aberdeen hooks are thin-wire, long-shanked hooks designed for fishing small grubs for panfish and minnows for walleyes.
Bait-holder hooks feature barbs cut into the shank to better hold worms, grubs, and leeches on the shank.
Circle hooks have a wide bend and a point that points toward the shank instead of parallel to it. They are designed for catch-and-release fishing; the hook’s design allows it to lip-hook most fish just by keeping tension on the line instead of sharply jerking the rod to set the hook.
Kirby hooks feature an offset bend to the left. A related hook, the Reverse, turns the offset to the right.
Octopus hooks feature an extra-wide gap between point and eye and a rounded bend. It’s designed for fishing cut bait for catfish and minnows for bass, walleye, and northern pike. It’s also useful for fishing nightcrawlers harnessed to the hook.
Rotating hooks feature an offset bend with a compound curve that lets the hook turn in the fish’s mouth when it takes the bait so that it can penetrate the mouth tissue from any angle.
Salmon egg hooks feature a turned-up eye and offset bend. Although intended for drift fishing with salmon eggs, they can also be used with grubs and small worms.
Weedless hooks feature either a thin wire loop or a heavier single wire guard to prevent the hook from fouling in weeds or brush. Both single and treble hooks are available with wire weed guards.
Worm hooks are designed for self-weedless rigging of plastic worms (burying the hook point inside the worm body). They feature either a dogleg bend at the top of the shank, near the eye, or a 60-degree bend in the middle of the shank.Snelled hooks come with monofilament leaders pre-tied to them. They usually have their eyes bent at an angle, with the leader tied (snelled) to the shank next to the eye and threaded through it.

, Originally, most sinkers were made of lead, but due to environmental concerns, many are now made of steel and some are made of tungsten.

, Sinkers fall into two classes: those that attach to the line to remain in a fixed position, and those designed to slide up and down the line they are threaded through. Within those classes are several types:


Split shot sinkers are small, round sinkers that clamp onto the line with either finger pressure or pliers. Some split shot feature small burrs on the end opposite the opening to allow them to be removed without cutting the line. Some split shot are identified by size number instead of by weight.
Rubber core sinkers are elongated sinkers with a slot for the line on one side and a twistable rubber core inside to secure the line within the slot. They are heavier than split shot.
Casting, or dipsey, sinkers are teardrop-shaped sinkers with wire eyes extending from them for attaching a line to.
Drop-shot sinkers are cylindrical or long rectangular sinkers with a round tie at the top. They are designed to remain in place when fishing live bait directly below a boat.
Disc sinkers are a disk-shaped variation of the casting sinker. Their shape lets them lie flat in fast water without getting snagged. Weights run from 1/2 to 4 ounces (14.17 to 113.4g).
Pyramid sinkers are another variation of the casting sinker. Their shape lets them dig into soft bottoms in fast water conditions. Weights run from 1 to 8 ounces (28.35 to 226.8g).
Bullet sinkers are sliding sinkers pointed on one end and often have a recessed cup on the other end designed to butt up against the plastic worms they are often fished with. Some fishermen peg them next to the worm by inserting a toothpick into the hole and breaking it off flush with the end of the sinker.
Egg sinkers are oval-shaped sliding sinkers. They are usually heavier than bullet sinkers, but may also be fished with plastic worms, usually with the worm hook attached to a leader and both the leader and line tied to a swivel that keeps the sinker from butting against the lure. Weights run from 1/8 to 1 ounce (3.54 to 28.35g).
Flat sinkers are sliding sinkers with a flat teardrop shape that lets them sink to the bottom and stay put in heavy currents. Weights run from 1 to 8 ounces (28.35 to 226.8g).
Walking sinkers are rectangular sliding sinkers with a slight bend that lets them “walk” by bouncing against the bottom during the retrieve. They are commonly used when slow-trolling or backtrolling live bait for walleye and smallmouth bass. Weights run from 1/8 to 1 1/2 ounces (3.54 to 42.52g)., Sinkers provide both casting weight and weight to take your bait to the desired depth. You need to use only the lightest sinker necessary to cast and take your bait as far underwater as you want. You don’t use sinkers at all in the following situations:


Fishing with heavy, lively baits.
Fishing with artificial lures. For small lures like dry (surface-fished) flies, if you need extra weight for casting, use a bobber that can be weighted with water.

, Bobbers are typically made of either cork or plastic. Plastic bobbers are more common.

, Bobbers are available in various sizes, but mostly in these shapes:


Round. This is the most common shape, available in either cork or plastic. Round plastic bobbers are usually red on the bottom and white on top, or orange on the bottom and yellow on top. These colors are meant to help anglers see the bobber and whether or not a fish has taken the bait by the bobber’s being pulled underwater.
Teardrop. This shape is also available in either cork or plastic. Plastic bobbers in this shape are often clear and include a stopper that can be removed to fill them with water to provide casting weight in place of a sinker but still have the flotation of a bobber.
Oval. Oval bobbers are more often cork, but may also be plastic.

, There are several ways to connect a bobber to your line:


Attached bobbers use spring-loaded hooks. These bobbers are always plastic. You can connect them only on the bottom, only on the top, or at both ends.
Slip bobbers are designed to be threaded onto your line and can slide up and down it as necessary. Some slip bobbers can be held in place with pegs, while others are restrained by tying beads onto your line.
Spring-tipped bobbers have projections on either end, with tiny springs wound around them for the line to be threaded through to keep the bobber in place.

, Although some round bobbers are as large as beach balls, too large a bobber will offer too much resistance for fish who bite lightly to take your bait.You also don’t always need a bobber, particularly not when you want to keep your bait on the bottom. For most lures, other than dry flies and some other surface baits, you don’t need to use a bobber.
When rigging a fishing line for a child who’s fishing for the first time, you may want to use a slightly larger bobber than usual so the child can better see if a fish has taken the bait.

, Swivels are designed to rotate instead of your line, preventing twist that can wear it out. Typically, you use swivels when fishing lures such as crankbaits or spoons and not with hooks carrying live bait or floating surface lures. Swivels come in several types:


Barrel swivels have loops on either end. You tie your line to one swivel end and your leader to the other.
Snap swivels are barrel swivels with either a pointed or rounded snap on one end. This allows you to quickly change artificial lures.
Most three-way swivels have a round ring in the center with three swiveling loops spaced 120 degrees apart. (Some versions, however, are barrel swivels with a third loop perpendicular to the two main loops.) Tie your line to one ring, your leader and hook to another, and another length of leader to a sinker for weight, or tie another leader and hook to fish two baits at once., Leaders can be made of light monofilament, heavy monofilament, or wire, depending on their purpose.


Use a light monofilament leader when fly fishing to aid in presenting your fly. You may also want to use a light monofilament leader when fishing a small bait and hook with an otherwise heavy rig.
Use a heavy monofilament leader in places where a light line would be likely to abrade (rocks, weeds, etc.).
Use a wire leader when fishing for fish whose teeth would saw into and cut your line, such as northern pike or muskellunge.

, The improved clinch knot is a popular and effective knot for tying a hook or swivel to your line. It can be used with either braided line or monofilament.


Thread your line through the hook or swivel eye about 6 inches (15 cm).
Wrap the tag end (free end of the line) around the standing end (the part of the line connected to your reel) 5 to 10 times. (You can also turn the hook or swivel eye this many times.)
Fold the line back on itself in a loop.
Thread the tag end through the space between the hook/swivel eye and the first wrap/twist.
Thread the tag end through the loop you made.
Pull on both the standing and tag end to draw the knot tight. (You may want to spit on the knot before you do this, to lubricate the line.)
Trim the tag end as close to the knot as you can without cutting into the knot itself.

, The Palomar knot is as effective as the improved clinch knot, although some anglers consider it more effective on braided line than the improved clinch.


Turn the last 6 inches (15cm) of your line back on itself.
Pass the doubled line through the eye of your hook or swivel.
Tie a loose overhand knot. Your hook, swivel, or lure should hang from the bottom of the loop.
Taking the knot between your thumb and forefinger, thread the loop over your hook/swivel/lure and slide it above the eye.
Pull on both the standing and tag ends to tighten the knot.
Trim the tag end as close to the knot as you can without cutting into the knot itself., Sometimes called the Grinner knot, the uni-knot, as its name implies, can do the same work as the improved clinch and the Palomar knot, and it can also be used to tie two lengths of line together.


Thread your line through the hook/swivel/lure eye and bend the tag end around to run parallel to the standing end, forming a loop.
Wrap the tag end around the doubled line 6 times.
Thread the tag end through the loop.
Pull the tag end to cinch up the turns. (As with the improved clinch, you may wish to spit on the line first.)
Slide the knot down to the eye, much like pulling a noose taut. You can slide it completely down or leave a small loop to allow the hook or lure to swing more freely.Other knots you may wish to learn include the blood knot, surgeon’s knot, and Bimini twist, which are designed to join two lines together. The uni-knot can substitute for all of these knots, however.

, This is the most common rig for first-time anglers. You can also fish the rig without a bobber.


Find the depth of the water you want to fish.
Place the bobber the same distance above the line as the distance from the surface to the bottom of the water.
Tie a hook onto the end of your line.
Place one or more split shot 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5cm) above the hook. Use only enough weight to bring the bait to the bottom, not enough to suppress its action.
Bait your hook., Also usable for still-fishing, the sliding sinker rig can be used when heavier weights than the split shot are needed without the fish feeling the sinker’s weight.


Use a leader of 18 to 24 inches (45 to 60cm). You can use a pre-made leader or snelled hook, or cut off a length of line to use as the leader and tie a hook to one end and a swivel to the other.
Thread a sliding sinker, such as an egg or walking sinker, to the line attached to your reel. You may wish to thread a bead after the sinker to keep it from striking your swivel or leader loop.
Tie the line to your swivel or leader loop.
Bait your hook., The 3-way rig lets you fish your bait in the same places as the sliding sinker rig, but lets your bait float higher off the bottom. However, it is easier for fish to feel the sinker’s weight.


Tie your line to one eye of the 3-way swivel.
Tie a length of 18 to 24 inches (45 to 60cm) to the second eye. This will serve as your drop line.
Tie a length of 24 to 36 inches (60 to 90cm) to the third eye. This will serve as your bait line.
Tie a drop shot, dipsey, or pyramid sinker to the drop line. (You can substitute several split shot for the drop shot sinker.)
Tie a hook to the bait line and bait it.(You can substitute an artificial lure such as a thin minnow for live bait with this rig.)

, This rig places the hook almost directly above the sinker and is useful for attracting fish suspended off the bottom.


Tie a leader of 24 to 36 inches (60 to 90cm) to a drop-shot sinker.
Tie both the other end of your leader and your line to your hook.
Bait the hook."

Use your lure according the fish activity.,
Experiment with different lures.",How to Use Fishing Lures," There are three categories of lures based on the depths they're used for: surface, sub-surface, and deep. What type of lure you should use will depend partially on the time of the year in which you're fishing. During Spring, gamefish are closer to the surface, so surface lures should be used.
During Summer, use deep lures.
During Fall, sub-surface lures will be most effective.;
, Different sized lures will be more effective with different fish. Typically, the bigger the fish, the bigger the lure should be. Recommend sizes for your lures according to fish type are as follows:For Crappies, Perch, Bluegills, River Trout, and White Bass, use one to three inch lures.
For Smallmouth Bass, use two to five inch lures, and for Largemouth Bass, use two to six inch lures.
For Walleyes, use three to six inch lures, and for Salmon and Lake Trout, use three to seven inch lures.
For Muskies and Northern Pikes, use four to twelve inch lures.

, For example, when fishing in water with thick weeds and brush, look for lures with weed guards to prevent snagging. There a variety of theories about how the color of a lure affects its effectiveness. A good rule of thumb is that light colored lures work best in clear water, and darker and fluorescent lures work best in dark, murky water., Different lures are better suited to attract a different types of fish under different settings. Some of the popular types of lures include:Topwater, or floating plug lures have a lot of movement across the water's surface forcing the fisherman to stay alert. These are surface lures.
Diving plug lures, or crankbait lures have a weighted lip in front of the head helping the lure to dive into the water. These can be either sub-surface or deep lures.
Vibrating lures contain a microprocessor and a tiny motor that mimics the random movements of live bait.
Spoons mimic the movement of swimming baitfish and are very versatile.
Soft plastic lures are made to resemble live bait more than any other type of lure. They can be used with or without weights.
Jigs are a common classic lure consisting of a head, skirt and hook. Their heads are weighted, and they are primarily used as deep lures.
Wirebait lures consist of spinners and buzzers. Spinner have one or more blades that spin around a safety-pin like body. Buzzers have a propeller on one piece of wire and a hook, skirt, and weighed body on the other side.

, Tie the lure directly to the line when using jigs especially.Lures are attached near the end of the fishing line. No matter the lure type you have selected, it will have an eyelet on one side that the fishing line can be fed through.Tie a knot directly connecting the lure to the fishing line. Three of the strongest knots used to tie lures include the San Diego jam, the six-turn Yucatan knot, and the Rapala knot.
San Diego jam: Pull the line through the lure and double it back about ten inches. Wrap the end of the line around both lengths of the line six times, moving toward the lure. Put the end of the line through the loop closest to the lure, and pull tight.
Six-turn Yucatan knot: This is used for attaching a heavier line to a lighter one. Overlap the lighter line by about 8 inches and line it up with the heavier line. Wrap the doubled-up lighter line around the heavier one six times. Thread the heavier line through the loop at the end of the lighter line and pull tight.
Rapala knot: Use this knot when the lure needs freer movement. Tie an overhand knot six inches down the end of the line. Thread the line through the lure and then through the loop in the knot. Make three wraps around the line and then pass the end through the loop again. Run the end through the new loop and pull tight.

, Snaps are great for when you're using a spoon lure or a crankbait lure. Any type of lure that wobbles instead of spinning will work best with a snap, because the snap will increase the action of the lure.Make sure your snap is not too big for your lure, large snaps can dampen the action of smaller lures.

, Twist can be due to picking up foreign material. Use a snap-swivel in water with heavy debris content, or when you're using a lure that spins.Make sure your snap-swivel is not too big for your lure, large snap-swivels can dampen the action of smaller lures.

, Once the lure is attached, the rod is now complete with the bait and hook. You are ready to fish. Cast the lure out into the water.

, Weather is the biggest factor in changing fish activity. Cold weather will slow down fish activity, so it's best to present your lure slowly. Warmer water calls for faster retrieves. The type of fish you're fishing also will change how you should use your lure, for example:For muskies and northern pikes, make sure there's an ample pause before you start your retrieve.
For walleyes, twitch the lure and pause it as you retrieve, or use small jig lures that you troll along the bottom.

, There are many varieties of lures that can be used, in a variety of ways, for a variety of situations, based on weather, type of fish, water conditions, time of year, etcetera. The best way to find the right lure is to experiment. Have a number of lures on hand and use this information as a starting point, not as hard-fast rules."
"
Carry an assortment of hooks.,
Carry a selection of sinkers.,
Include a few bobbers.,
Consider some artificial lures.,
Keep some swivels on hand to prevent line twist.,
Carry leaders if the species you're fishing for requires using them.,
Carry a stringer.,
Keep a spool of line in your tackle box.",How to Start Up a Freshwater Fishing Tackle Box2," Most first-time fishermen start out fishing with live bait, either worms or minnows, and many experienced fishermen also use live or prepared baits at least some of the time, depending on the type of fish they are fishing for. A good selection of hooks is helpful in fishing with live or prepared baits of various sizes and for fish of various species and sizes. Hooks come in 3 types �- single, double, and treble -� and a number of sizes. Some hooks are equipped with wire weed guards, while others bend the points at an angle.


Single hooks have only a single point. Most types have straight shafts, although some, such as those used to fish plastic worms with the hook point buried in the worm body (self-weedless rigs), feature bent shafts. Other single hooks feature points that are bent at an angle to the shaft.
Double hooks feature 2 points, bent at a 30-degree angle from the shaft. They are more commonly found on lures such as the Hofschneider Red Eye spoon than used with live bait.
Treble hooks feature 3 points set 120 degrees apart. They are often used with prepared baits such as dough balls or marshmallows or with large live baits such as minnows when fishing for species that might turn the bait in their mouths such that a single hook would miss the roof of the fish's mouth when an angler attempts to set the hook.
Hook sizes are numeric. For hook sizes given as straight numbers (2, 4, 6, 8, etc.), the larger the number, the smaller the hook. Hook sizes that include the designation ""/0"" (read as ""aught"" or ""oh"" after the number before the slash) are larger than hooks without this designation; the larger the number before the slash, the larger the hook. You'll want to use smaller hooks when fishing for smaller species such as bluegill, crappie, and other panfish with tiny baits such as grubs and worm pieces and larger hooks when fishing for larger species such as bass, walleye, trout, and pike with larger baits such as whole earthworms, minnows, or shad.

, Sinkers are pieces of lead or steel that provide casting weight to lightweight baits and help the bait sink to the bottom. You'll want to use enough weight to help you cast and present your offering, but not so much that it creates an undue amount of drag when a fish takes it. Sinkers come in several types, as described below:


Split shot are small, round sinkers with an opening the center. They are designed to be crimped on your line with either fingers or pliers. Some split shot also feature nibs on the opposite side to let you remove the sinker without cutting your line. Split shot are often packaged in a round, plastic package that offers an assortment of sizes.
Dipsey, or bell, sinkers are bell-shaped sinkers molded around a metal shaft with an eye through which you loop your line to attach them. They are useful when you need more weight than split shot can provide; larger ones can also be used as practice plugs to practice your casting away from the fishing hole. Some dipsey sinkers feature special eyes that let you fish them in a fixed position on your line or as slip sinkers. You can buy individual packages of a single size or an assortment of sizes as with the split shot.
Slip sinkers are designed to be threaded onto your line and slide up and down as necessary. These come in 3 styles: round slip shot, bullet-shaped sinkers used when fishing Texas-rigged plastic worms, and egg-shaped sinkers used when fishing a variation of the Texas rig known as the Carolina rig.

, Bobbers help keep your bait afloat when you need to suspend it off the bottom and also provide an indication of when a fish has taken your bait. Bobbers come in several types:


Clip-on bobbers come in 2 types. The more common ""beach ball"" type is round and features a button on one side that extends a hook on the opposite side into which you insert your line, then release the button. (A variation of this kind of bobber has a second hook in the button to better secure your line.) The other type is elongated and uses a tiny spring on 1 or both ends to hold it on the line. You'll want to have bobbers of this type no larger than 1 inch (2.5 cm).
Slip bobbers are designed to slide up and down the line the way slip sinkers do. Some bobbers of this type are clear and designed to be filled with water to provide casting weight when fishing ultralight lures, such as fishing flies with ultralight spinning tackle.

, Many fishermen are perfectly content to fish with only live or prepared baits. Others, however, enjoy fishing with artificial lures. Unlike live bait, which can simply be cast out and let sit, artificial lures usually must be retrieved to attract fish. Lures are available in a number of sizes and types. You'll want to have a selection of jigs, spoons, and spinners, plastic worms and crankbaits if you fish for bass, and flies if you fish for trout.

, Some lures, such as spoons and crankbaits, can cause the line to twist as they wobble when retrieved. Attaching a swivel to your line before attaching such a lure will prevent this. Swivels can also be used as a line stop for slip sinkers or slip bobbers. The best swivels feature tiny ball bearings to help them rotate more freely.


Some swivels are equipped with snaps at one end to make it easier to change lures. Look for snap swivels with rounded snaps to allow the lure greater freedom of movement.
Some lures, such as jigs, flies, and self-weedless rigged plastic worms, are intended to be tied directly to the line.

, For most fishing, most of the time, you won't need to use a leader. The main times you'll want a leader are for fly fishing and when fishing for species such as northern pike and muskellunge, whose teeth can snag and cut monofilament fishing line.


Leaders for fly fishing are made of monofilament and tied directly to both the fly and the fly fishing line. They are of various lengths.
Leaders for pike fishing are made of bare or coated wire and usually have a swivel on one end and a snap on the other. They are usually about 1 foot (0.3 m) in length.

, Stringers are useful for keeping fish you've caught while you continue fishing. The simplest stringer is a length of heavy, narrow cord similar to that used in trot lines, while more common stringers are lengths of lightweight chain with large metal snaps attached at various places. (A more expensive form of this stringer covers the chain with plastic tubing to prevent rust.)


You won't need a stringer, however, if you practice catch and release fishing or if you fish from a boat equipped with a live well, a small tank commonly found in bass boats.

, Although swivels can help prevent line twist, over time your line can still become brittle from twists and nicks. Having a spool of replacement line can be helpful if you find your line repeatedly breaking while fishing. This line can also be used for makeshift leaders, such as when fishing a Carolina rig.


If you fish with spinning or spincasting tackle, you can carry your extra line on an extra reel spool so you can swap spools. You can even carry several spools with different weights of line to adjust to different conditions.

Carry at least 1 pair of needle-nose pliers.,
Have a utility knife or clippers.,
Take along a fillet knife.,
Assemble a small first aid kit.,
Include items to protect you from the great outdoors.",How to Start Up a Freshwater Fishing Tackle Box3," Needle-nose pliers are useful both to help you attach and remove split shot sinkers from your line and to help you remove the hook from the fish's mouth. (Some fishermen carry 2 sets, one to remove the hook and the other to hold onto the fish.) Look for a pair with a reasonably long point, allowing you to reach deep into the fish's mouth, if necessary.


Pliers can also be used to help peel away the skin from catfish. Special pliers are made for this task, but you can also use a pair of snub-nose or adjustable pliers.

, Either of these items will help you cut the tag end of your fishing line after tying a knot and can be useful for other purposes as well.

, If you clean your fish on-site, a good fillet knife, which features a long, thin, sharp blade, will help you separate the fish's meat from its bones and skin.


Fish other than catfish and carp can be scaled instead of filleted. If you prefer to scale your fish, you'll need a fish scaler, which is shaped somewhat like a brush but replaces the bristles with jagged metal teeth used to remove the scales from your fish. You'll still need a good knife to cut off the fish's head.
Some fishing sites provide fish cleaning stations, while most don't. To keep your fish from moving around while cleaning it, you can purchase a cleaning board with a clamp on one end to hold the fish's tail while you work

, Having a first aid kit along will help you deal with the bumps, bruises, and cuts that may happen while you're in the outdoors. A few adhesive bandages, an antiseptic salve, some gauze, a small spool of waterproof medical tape, and perhaps a small bottle of hand sanitizer will cover most of the minor injuries you're likely to deal with.


You can pick up some of these items for free if you attend trade shows. Many hospitals and health agencies who exhibit at these shows offer small first aid kits or their components as promotional items.

, While fishing provides an opportunity to get away from the rigors of life, you can also come back with a sunburn instead of sunfish, insect bites instead of fish bites, and eye strain from squinting because of the bright sun. Having bottles of sunscreen and insect repellent, as well as a pair of polarized sunglasses will help you enjoy your time more and let you concentrate more on fishing.

Find your fishing weight.,
Choose the size and type of weight designed for the type of fishing you're planning on doing.,
Purchase fishing line.,
Slide your weight onto the line through the opening in the top of the weight.,
Place a piece of rubber band along the line just beneath where you want the weight to be.,
Take the open end on the line and securely wrap it around the rubber band with approximately five loops.,
Take the free end of the line and feed it down beside the rubber band and under your loops.,
Use a pair of scissors to trim the end of the line extending from the knot, if needed.",How to Tie Fishing Weights," There are numerous sizes, shapes and types of fishing weights to choose from. Visit your local bait and tackle or hardware store to find your weight.;
, The outside of the package on the weight should let you know what type of fishing it is designed for.

, Make sure your fishing line is strong enough to support a weight, it should be written on the package if it is designed for heavy duty wishing equipment.

, Slide the weight to the desired level of your line. For example, if you're bottom fishing, you will want to leave the weight near the end of the line.

, Hold it securely until you are ready to fasten it to the line.

, Begin this process near the bottom of the rubber band and work your way upward.

, Pull the line tight, securing the weight and the line together. Give the line an extra tug to make sure the weight is secure.

, If you decide to do this leave at least 1/8-inch of line extending from the knot.

Determine what kind of reel you use.,
Locate your drag adjustment.,
Learn the breaking strength for your line.,
Get a scale.",How to Set the Drag on a Fishing Reel1," There are three basic types of reels that contain your line. This article won't get into the pros and cons of each; instead, it's important that you know what kind you have and where the drag adjustment is located.









Spincasting reels are closed face. Your line will be encased by a cone-like cover and the line feeds out of a small hole in it.Spinning reels are open-faced. Your line spool will be exposed and you'll be able to watch it spin out. This one looks the most exposed.Baitcasting reels look like a mix between an open- and closed-face reel. The most noticeable feature is that the whole line spool will turn when you cast the line.;
, Now that you know what kind of reel you're using, learn where the drag adjustment is located on your reel.









The spincast's drag adjustment is usually next to the reel handle. It looks somewhat like a star-shaped knob and may click as you play with the drag. This allows you to hear just how much you're adjusting.
The spinning reel's drag adjustment is a circular knob facing out at the front of your line spool.
The baitcaster's drag adjustment looks like a star and is located next to the reel handle. Turning it clockwise will tighten it and counter-clockwise loosens the drag., Look on the package your line came in. It should clearly state in pounds how much resistance your line can handle without breaking.









This will tell you what your optimum drag should be. Drag should always be no more than 25 percent of your your breaking strength's resistance. To figure drag, simply divide your breaking strength by 4. The result is what your drag should be set at., Now that you know what your drag should be, you'll need to see where your drag is currently set.









You can use a digital scale or a spring scale (such as the sort used to weigh fish). Both have a hook at the end to which you attach your line.

Know the types of plastic worm.,
Choose the right worm color.,
Choose the right length.",How to Rig a Fishing Pole for Plastic Worm Fishing1," As noted above, plastic worms and related soft plastic lures come in a variety of lengths and shapes. A partial list of these plastic worms is given below:

Finesse worms. These plastic worms are thin, short worms of 3 to 4 inches (7.5 to 10 cm), designed to fish with light tackle in clear water conditions, such as those found in older reservoirs that have lost most of their grass and sunken timber cover. They are often fished with light split shot or ""Slider"" jig heads.



 


Straight-tail worms. These worms, usually 6 inches (15 cm) in length, resemble nightcrawlers in appearance, usually in everything but color. These worms are usually retrieved straight, although they can also be fished in a ""lift-and-drop"" style.






Paddle-tail worms. These worms feature longer segments and a tail that looks like the business end of a paddle or oar. These worms are often fished with a straight retrieve. Paddle-tail worms are usually around 7 inches (17.5 cm) in length, although jumbo version may exceed 10 inches (25 cm).






Forked-tail worms. These worms come in the same lengths and are segmented like paddle-tail worms, but they feature a forked tail instead of a paddle tail.






�French-fry"" worms. These worms have pronounced segments like that of a crinkle-cut French fry or of a centipede or caterpillar. These segments create resistance when the worm is drawn through the water, producing an erratic swimming motion.






Ribbon-tail/ripple-tail worms. These worms may be segmented near the head like either straight-tail or paddle-tail worms, but they feature a curved tail section that ripples or waves like a ribbon when the worm is drawn through the water. Some plastic worms of this type feature little more than a hook-like tail, while others devote 1/2 to 2/3 of the worm's length to the curved tail; some feature 2 or more tail curls. These worms are usually fished in low-visibility conditions or in underwater cover, but they may also be fished in open water as an alternative to finesse or straight-tail worms. Some styles of this type of worm have a tendency to hang up in submerged brush, which some anglers try to prevent by liberally coating the worm with scented oils.;
, While natural worms are pinkish or brownish in color, most fishermen favor non-natural worm colors, with purple being the most popular. In general, anglers fishing plastic worms follow the same rule as fishing other lures, using light colors such as blue, green, or pearl on bright days and clear water conditions and darker colors such as purple or black on dark days and in cloudier or choppy water.


Some worms, notably the ripple-tail variety, feature 2 colors, usually a darker color for the head and a lighter, sometimes fluorescent color, for the tail. The fluorescent tail color can be an attractor in particularly dark water conditions.






Some plastic worms are impregnated with flecks of glitter to give them a metallic appearance.






In some cases, when the fish are nibbling on a plastic worm but not hitting solidly, you can increase your chances of success by changing to a different color worm, even if the new color doesn't follow the ""light day-light color, dark day-dark color"" rule.







, Use shorter worms with light tackle in clear water or clear sky conditions when the fish aren't biting, such as during the first few days following a cold front. Use longer worms when fish are biting aggressively. In most cases, you'll favor a length of 6 to 7 inches (15 to 17.5 cm).


If you're fishing for smallmouth bass, choose a shorter worm; if you're fishing for largemouth (particularly the larger Florida strain), choose a longer worm.

"
Assemble your rod.,
Tie your line to the scale.,
Position your rod.,
Pull down on the scale.,
Adjust your drag.",How to Set the Drag on a Fishing Reel2," Set up your rod and thread the line as though you are going to actually use the rod. Be sure to thread the line through all of the guides in order to get an accurate reading.








, You'll need to tie it securely to the hook at the end of your digital or spring scale. Make sure the line can't slip off when the scale is pulled.








, Hold the rod at a 45 degree angle. It's useful to have a friend hold your rod or the scale. Keep the scale vertical so that the hook and line are at the top.








, At first, your line won't do anything other than bend down with the weight. Then, you should notice the drag start to slip and the line extend. As soon as this happens, look at the scale and take a measurement.








, Look at where your drag is and what it should be set at. Use the drag adjustment knob on your reel and tighten or loosen as needed. Check the drag on a scale.

"
Decide whether you're fishing with heavy or light tackle.",How to Rig a Fishing Pole for Plastic Worm Fishing2," Fishing in cover such as weeds, submerged timber, or large rocks calls for heavier tackle than does fishing in open water with comparatively little cover. Clearer water also calls for lighter tackle than does dark water because light penetrates to a greater depth.

Heavy-tackle rods for plastic worm fishing typically run 5 1/2 to 6 feet (1.65 to 1.8 m), with a medium to heavy action. (Some anglers, however, favor rods as long as 7 feet/2.1 m.) They can be paired with a spinning, spincasting, or baitcasting reel with lines ranging as light as 8-pound test (4 kg class) to as heavy as 20-pound test (10 kg class).






Light-tackle rods for plastic worm fishing can run from 6 to 7 feet (1.8 to 2.1 m) and feature a softer action than heavy-tackle rods. Typical fishing lines for light-tackle fishing run from 4-pound test (2 kg class) for ultralight fishing to 8-pound test (4 kg class) and are more likely to be fished with spinning or spincasting reels than baitcasting reels, as lighter lines are more likely to slip behind the spool of a baitcasting reel.






If you can afford it, buy a rod with a graphite blank instead of a fiberglass one. Graphite is more sensitive than fiberglass, providing you with a better feel of how your lure is performing and also better enabling you to detect when a fish takes the bait.

"
Choose the right hook.,
Thread a slip sinker onto your line before tying the hook.,
Tie the hook directly to your line.,
Thread the plastic worm onto the hook for the distance between the hook's eye and bend.,
Push the point of the hook out of the worm body and pull the hook through until the eye is just inside the head.,
Turn the hook around and re-embed it in the body of the worm.",How to Rig a Fishing Pole for Plastic Worm Fishing3," The most common way to rig plastic worms for fishing is to use a self-weedless rig, where the hook is threaded through and buried in the body of the worm so that it won't foul on weeds, timber, or rocks. (The most popular version of this rig is the Texas rig, which will be the main focus of this section.) Hooks for this type of rigging feature a dogleg bend about 1 inch (2.5 cm) down from the eye and a wide curve at the barb end, with the point of the hook parallel to the eye. The hook you use should be proportionate to the size of the worm you fish with, as follows:


Use a size 1 or 1/0 hook with finesse worms of 4 inches (10 cm) or shorter.
Use a size 2/0 hook for worms of 5 to 6 inches (12.5 to 15 cm) in length.
Use a size 3/0 or 4/0 hook for worms of 7 to 8 inches (17.5 to 20 cm) in length.

, The most common way to weight the line when using the Texas version of the self-weedless rig is to use a bullet-shaped slip sinker, although a needle-nosed weight can be substituted when fishing around weeds. This sinker is threaded with the point end toward the rod and the cup end toward the hook, so that the worm head will rest in the cup when the line is cast. If a very light weight is necessary, you can substitute a split shot or slip shot.

Choose the lightest weight of sinker you can get away with for the depth of the water you're fishing in: 1/16- to 1/8-ounce (3.54 to 7.08 g) for water less than 6 feet (1.8 m) deep, 1/8- to 1/4-ounce (7.08 to 14.15 g) for water 6 to 12 feet (1.8 to 3.6 m) deep, 1/4- to 3/8-ounce (14.15 to 21.23 g) for water 12 to 18 feet (3.6 to 5.4 m) deep, and 3/8- to 1/2-ounce (21.23 to 28.35 g) for water deeper than 18 feet (5.4 m).






When fishing in heavy cover, some anglers choose to ""peg"" their slip sinkers at the end of their lines by inserting a toothpick in the hole on the side that touches the worm and breaking it off, effectively turning it into a jig head. Other anglers choose to use self-weedless jig heads; one variety of such features a barbed wire attached to the jig eye that is threaded through the worm head while the hook is threaded into the body of the worm.






A Texas rigged plastic worm can also be fished on the surface by using no sinker at all. If you need additional weight to cast, tie a swivel 8 inches (20 cm) ahead of the worm. You may also want to use an offset hook in place of the hook normally used for a self-weedless rig.







, Most versions of the self-weedless rig require you to tie the hook directly to your line without using an intervening leader, snap, or swivel. This allows the cup of the bullet sinker to rest directly against the worm head once the worm is threaded on.


One version of the self-weedless rig, the Carolina rig, does use a swivel and length of leader between the worm and sinker, which is usually a heavy, egg-shaped sinker. This rig is set up this way to allow the worm to float up some distance from the sinker in an attempt to attract fish suspended off the bottom.

, Push the point of the hook through the tip of the worm's head and slide the worm gently up the hook.

, Exit the worm so that the tail is perpendicular to the hook if the worm is a straight tail, paddle-tail, or fork-tail worm, or so the curve of a ribbon or ripple tail worm is parallel to the bend of the hook.

, Push the point of the hook so that it almost completely goes through the worm body, but not quite. This will make it easier to set the hook if and when a fish takes the lure. The worm should hang straight on the hook when rigged this way.

Purchase an airbrush kit.,
Purchase an air compressor that is designed for painting fishing lures.,
Set the air pressure on the air compressor between 30 to 40 psi, and connect it to your airbrush.

,
Dip a cotton ball in rubbing alcohol to clean your fishing lure.,
Cover the bill of the fishing lure with painter's tape.,
Practice your fishing lure painting technique.,
Apply epoxy to your painted lures.",How to Paint Fishing Lures," A gravity feed model is recommended because it allows the paint to naturally fall into place from the cup on top of the brush, which causes you to use less paint, creates a better finish, and allows you more control over your painting technique.;
, Make sure the air compressor can produce and least 40 psi and has a valve to adjust the air pressure up and down.

,, This will help to remove any dirt or other residue as well as allow the paint to bond to the lure better.

, This prevents paint from sticking to it.

, Use a gentle, meticulous painting technique. Many painters blend and fade colors as their technique becomes more advanced. Have multiple fishing lures nearby so that you can start over if you make a mistake.

, This protects the paint and makes it waterproof. Hang up the lure, and allow it to dry. Dry times vary between brands of epoxy, and specific drying times are noted on the packaging.

Choose a suitable place to work.,
Decide what type of fishing lure you want to make.,
Decide how large to make your lure.,
Choose an appropriate wood.",How to Make Wooden Fishing Lures1," A basement or garage woodworking shop is ideal, but any place where you can do the cutting, carving, sanding, drilling, and painting required will work.;
, Plugs fall into 2 basic types, topwater lures, and diving baits. Topwater lures are designed to fish on the surface, which diving baits usually feature a lip that causes them to dive below the surface when retrieved rapidly. Some specific designs of both lures are listed below:


Poppers. Poppers feature a depression on the front of the lure that creates water resistance when the lure is jerked across the surface. Fred Arbogast's Hula Popper and Heddon's Chug'n Spook are 2 examples of this type of lure.
Stick baits. These cigar-shaped lures are lightly weighted at the rear so that the back of the lure is below the surface while the front is above it. These lures are fished with a jerking motion to simulate a wounded baitfish. Smithwick's Devil's Warhorse and Heddon's Super Spook are 2 examples of stick baits.
Propeller baits. Cigar-shaped like stick baits, propeller baits replace the rear weight with a 2-bladed propeller at either end. Also fished in a jerking motion, these lures attract fish from the splashing and vibration of the propellers. Smithwick's Devil's Horse and Cotton Cordell Crazy Shad are 2 examples of this lure; Fred Arbogast's Sputterbuzz uses a large propeller blade like that found on some spinner baits in place of 2 smaller propellers.
Splutterbaits. These topwater lures feature a metal plate on its front or sides that creates resistance and causes the lure to sway from side to side as it is retrieved. Fred Arbogast's Jitterbug and the Heddon Crazy Crawler are 2 examples of this lure.
Thin minnows. These are long, narrow lures with a small diving lip on the front to make them dart around like minnows when retrieved. Normark's Rapala is the best-known lure of this type.
Curved minnows. These lures have no lip but have curved bodies and a flat spot on front that causes the lure to wobble from side to side while being retrieved. The Lazy Ike and Helin Flatfish are the 2 best examples of this type of lure.
Alphabet plugs. These crank baits feature a short diving lip, a chubby belly, and often an internal rattle. They are designed to be rapidly retrieved; the lure's lip and belly cause it to shimmy like a fast-swimming baitfish. The name ""alphabet plug"" comes from the first lure of this type, Cotton Cordell's Big O, which got its name from the athletic nickname of the brother of the lure's inventor.
Deep-divers. These long-lipped crank baits are designed to be fished fast; their longer lips make them dive deeper than alphabet plugs can. Some of these lures will suspend themselves at the depth they dove to when the retrieve is stopped. The Rebel Humpback and the Heddon Magnum Hellbender are 2 examples of this type.

, Plugs and crank baits for bass usually run from 3 to 6 inches (7.5 to 15 cm) long, with the thickness varying according to the type of plug. Plugs for muskellunge (muskies) are significantly larger, as muskies are the largest members of the pike family, reaching weights up to 70 lb (31.8 kg).

, Softwoods such as balsa, basswood, cedar, and pine are lightweight, easily shaped woods that more readily float, making them suitable for most topwater plugs and diving lures that wiggle widely. (Generally, commercially made wooden lures are made with softwoods.) Hardwoods such as ash, maple, oak, and walnut are tougher to shape and are better suited for plugs that shimmy tightly when retrieved and hold their depth when the retrieve is stopped.

Cut a wood block slightly larger than the dimensions of your lure.

,
Draw a pattern on the top, bottom, and sides of the block.,
Cut along the pattern lines.,
Carve out the details with a knife.,
Sand down the wood.,
Drill any necessary holes.,
Paint your lure.,
Screw in the eyelets.,
Attach the hooks.",How to Make Wooden Fishing Lures2,", You'll use this pattern as a guide to cut away the unnecessary part of the wood block. You can either draw the pattern freehand or make a template for the top and bottom and another for the sides.

, While you can use a knife to start whittling at this point, for most lure designs, you'll find it faster to use a scroll saw.


Depending on the design of the lure you're making, you may have to tape the block back together after cutting out the sides so you can cut out the top and bottom.

, Now you can whittle in earnest, using a sharp knife designed for carving wood to round the lure body into its intended shape. You can also etch patterns and designs into the wood.


Cut away from yourself when whittling to keep from being cut if the knife slips.
If you're making a popper, you may want to use a rotary tool (such as a Dremel) and cutter to carve out the depression at the front of the lure.

, Once you've created the lure's approximate shape with the knife, use coarse grit sandpaper to refine that shape. When you have the shape down, smooth it with medium sandpaper, and then go over it again with fine sandpaper to ready the wood for painting.

, First, mark out the places where you'll insert the eyelet screws and holes for the ballast weight and rattle, if desired, then drill them out, using a bit slightly thinner than the screw's thickness.


If your lure will have a diving lip that requires cutting a slot into the body to glue it in place, now is the time to cut the slot. Use a waterproof epoxy to hold the lip in place.
You can use a BB, buckshot, or a small split shot for the ballast weight. Use wood glue or a waterproof putty to seal up the hole.
Lure rattles consist of several metal pellets inside a very thin glass tube. You may need a caliper to determine the tube's thickness to figure out what size drill bit to use for the insertion hole.

, Whether you use brushes and paint freehand or an airbrush and stencils, painting is a 4-step process:


First, apply a clear sealer to protect the wood from water damage.
Second, apply several coats of primer.
Third, paint the lure in the colors you want. You can get ideas for colors from fishing lure catalogs.
Fourth, apply a waterproof clearcoat to seal the paint.

, You'll need a front eyelet to attach the lure to your fishing line and one for each hook.


On bass lures, for the front eyelet, use an eyelet screw with a one-inch (2.5 cm) thread. For the hook eyelets, use eyelet screws with 1/4-inch (6.25 mm) threads. You'll need larger eyelets made of stainless steel for muskie lures.
For some lures, you may want to thread a cup or one or more beads onto the eyelet screw before attaching it. This may require an eyelet screw with a longer thread.

, The easiest way to do this is to use split rings. Thread a treble hook onto the split ring, then thread the split ring onto the rear and bottom eyelets. You may find it easier to open the split ring with special split-ring pliers.


You can also put the hooks on without using split rings by opening the hook eyelets first, threading the hooks onto them, and then screwing them in place. Be careful you don't puncture your fingers if you choose to do this.
Although treble hooks are the most common hooks used on plugs and crank baits, you can substitute double hooks. Most double hooks are designed so you can slip them onto the eyelet without using split rings.

Trim off any excess plastic.",How to Make Soft Plastic Lures," Look for a place with good ventilation where burns and spills won't matter.;
, An old baking pan works well for this purpose. If you're making more than 1 soft plastic lure, you can arrange several molds on the pan.

, This will make it easier to remove the soft plastic lure from the mold after it cools and solidifies.

, If you fill the cup fuller than this, you may have difficulty pouring the resin into the mold once it's heated.


If you're melting down old soft plastic lures, put them in the cup in place of the resin.

, As the resin heats, it will first thicken and then thin, changing from a milky white to clear. Stop heating at once if you see smoke.

,, Add the color drop by drop until you have the shade you want. Stir the resin slowly as you add color.

, Use only non-metal glitter to avoid starting a fire in the microwave. As with color, add scents and flavorings gradually in small amounts.

,, This will prevent bubbles from forming.


It may take several tries before you learn to fill the mold to the right level.

,,, Be sure to lay the molded plastic out flat, as it will set in the position in which you lay it out.


If the lure does set in a crooked position, you can melt it down and re-pour it.

,, You can do this with a craft knife, scissors, or a pizza cutter.


As you trim the excess, gather it together. You can melt it down and add it to your next soft plastic lure, or you can add the shavings at the very end to add highlights to lures of a contrasting color.

While box cutters usually cut the best, a serrated bread knife works well too.;
, These will allow water into the trap. Using either the tip of a knife or a hot nail (heat will cause the plastic to melt), put a few 1 centimeter holes around the middle of the bottle.

, Simply run your string or fishing line through two holes, then tie a knot between the two ends to make a simple handle. This will make it easier to remove the trap later.

, Cut just below the point where the top meets the ""body"" of the bottle. You will be left with a a cylinder and a tapered top section. Keep the top and discard the cap and the bottom cylinder.

, This is the entrance for the minnows -- they are funneled into the hole by the tapered top and then trapped inside the body of the other bottle.

, You can also punch holes in both bottles with a hot nail -- this will melt the plastic together.

, This is your bait. One inch pieces should be big enough. You can also put some sand, dirt, or rocks in the trap to help it sink and keep it from floating away.

, Minnows tend to swarm in shallow, slow moving pools of water. You can often see them from the shore, so put your trap somewhere you will get plenty of ""bites.""


Push the trap lightly underwater so it fills up and sinks.

, The fish will be funneled into the trap, but are unable to find their way back through the small hole made with the top of the bottle. You can unscrew the bottom of your trap to get the minnows out, then screw it back up to use again.

Loop your shuttle through the second loop.,
Pull your shuttle up through the “V”.,
Remove the gauge and start again.,
Complete your net with frame or weights.",How to Make a Handmade Fishing Net," In theory your fishing net can be made of any string or twine. Think about what species you're trying to catch, and how it's size might affect the strength of the string used.

It’s recommended that you use a bonded nylon string for strength. Of all contemporary twine it is the most durable and reliable.
If you don’t have any nylon on hand or are unable to get any, consider practicing with whatever string you might have around.;
, The two essential tools for the net making process will be your shuttle (or netting needle) and gauge (or sizing card). Both shuttle and gauge can be found at your local craft or sporting goods store.

The width of your gauge will determine the size of your finished net’s mesh. The diagonal of each mesh square will be equal to the width of your gauge.
The shuttle is the needle with which you will weave the net, and needs to be smaller in width than your gauge so as to pass through the holes made for the mesh.

, Ideally this will be a table large enough to fit your completed net, laying flat. Though it’s not necessary, it’ll come in handy when trying to rest the net in between steps.

What you do need is a nail (or a clamp with the center screw facing upwards) in the edge of table on the far side away from you. This rod will serve as the starting point for your net., To begin, you'll need to wrap your twine around the shuttle you'll use for your net. If you run out of twine before the shuttle is full, tie the end to another spool of twine. Cut the tags that remain on the knot and continue loading.

Lay your shuttle flat in your hand and lay the end of the twine flat along the top, facing you.
Take the twine and loop it around the center peg of the shuttle so it comes back towards you.
Lay the string down on the same side parallel to the end strand, and run it down the shuttle and flip it over and run it up the other side.
Loop this piece around the center peg and back down facing you, and repeat the process until you’re out of twine or the shuttle becomes too full to handle., The loop you make in this step needs to be close to the width of your gauge so that your shuttle may pass through it. Don't worry too much about the precision in size; so long as the shuttle can pass through, it's fine. This loop will hang extraneous at the edge of your net when completed.

The overhand knot is the one most everybody is familiar with: you make a loop and pass the end of the line through the loop, pulling both ends to tighten.
Take the loop that has formed from the knot and put it around the peg you’re using.

, As mentioned above, your gauge will determine the eventual size of the net holes in the finished net. Every net you make will begin with one square, the sizing of which starts here.

Slide your gauge up underneath the string attached to the loop just created. The loop should be situated on the peg so that it’s knot is closest you; have the gauge pushed up to the knot so that the knot touches the gauge's top edge.
Hold the string with your thumb atop the gauge, using the hand opposite the one which will use the shuttle.

, At this point you're looking to tighten the string around your gauge, which is accomplished in this step. You'll look to recreate the tightness with which the string grips the gauge in this step as you continue; uniform tightness will mean evenly-sized net squares once complete.

Your shuttle should be to the right of your peg, loop, and gauge; from the right, pull the shuttle up through the loop (through the V made by the peg, twine, and gauge).
Then, pull it down towards you, cinching tight around your gauge. Place your thumb on top on the knot and string to hold it.

, Repeating the knot is important for the eventual strength of your finished net. The more knots, the sturdier the net will be.

Take your shuttle, which should be on the right of your peg and loop, and pass it under the loop and back over. There should now be a slackened loop hanging under the taut loop.
Pass the shuttle under this loop and up to the right of the taut loop; continue pulling the shuttle and twine up until the knot formed is tight around the gauge. Then repeat this step one more time., You should be left with two loops emerging from the original loop hung on the peg, along with the rest of your string attached to your shuttle.

You’ll need to choose one of these two loops to continue with the process, and it doesn’t matter which one. Both will be dealt with by the time your net is made.

, Continuing your net will simply be a matter of repeating (with some alteration) the steps just completed. Here, for example, you'll be placing your gauge much in the same way you placed it originally.

Slide your gauge back under the single string coming from the two loops. Going under your gauge, slide your shuttle through one of the two loops just formed.
You should be able to pull the knot tight and the gauge closer to the knot by bringing the shuttle upwards through the loop.

, Again, you're looking to tighten the string around the gauge by creating another knot. Be sure with each knot made that it's as tight as it can be.

Once your bring the shuttle under and over, there should form another slackened loop as in step 1.5.
With your shuttle back to the right, pull it through this loop from underneath and back towards you to create another knot. This knot should be tight against the edge of gauge farthest from you (closest to the peg).

, After making a knot from the first one, repeat the process with the second loop formed earlier (whichever you chose not to start with).

Pull the shuttle through the loop from under and back towards you to make a knot at the edge of the gauge. There should now be a “V” shape formed by the two loops pulled tight against your gauge (the point of the “V” should face the peg).

, Here you continue to add knots to the far edge of the gauge to strengthen the net. The knots form in this step here will be those which close the square that begins the net.

Coming from the right, pull your shuttle up through the gap in the “V” to make another slackened loop as in previous steps. The loop should hang to the right of the ""V.""
Pull your shuttle up and through this loop and down towards you to tighten into a knot. Then repeat this step exactly.

, Once you’ve removed the gauge, you should have the first square of your net, with a loop coming out of either side (to the left and right). Take either of these loops and repeat as though the chosen loop is the one begun with in step 1.3.

Repeating these steps should increasingly widen the net as you continue to make loops and knots; every new square will have two attached loops with which to continue.
Once your net has reach desired length, you will ignore one of these two loops to narrow the net back down., Depending on how you plan to use this net, you may want to attach it to a wooden frame you have, or make a casting net by attaching a long rope and weights. No matter which you choose, be sure to store your net in such a way that it doesn't get tangled.


In either case, it’s acceptable to use extra bits of string to fasten whatever you need to the net, or to fasten the net to a frame. For more durability (if you’re less picky on the condition of the wood), use heavy duty staples to attach the net."

Periodically check the trap.",How to Make a Fish Trap," The size of the trap will vary depending on the fish you hope to catch and the waters you plan to trap them in. Minnows or pan fish for bait can be caught in a trap 12 inches (30.5 cm) by 24 inches (61.0 cm), while large catfish, carp and suckers require a much larger trap. You also want to be sure your trap is not taller than the depth of the water if you plan to use it in shallow areas.;
, Many are rectangular, with a 1:2:4 height, width, and length ratio, but cylindrical traps work well if there is not any current in the water to cause them to roll and become fouled.

, In Alabama, where trapping catfish is a long-standing tradition, craftsmen build the finest traps using white oak strips, woven together with galvanized steel or copper wire. Because such traps require considerable skill and time, we will look at building a trap with a wire mesh fabric or poultry netting.


The choice then, is the mesh size, determined by the size of fish you are trapping. For bait minnows, a hardware cloth in 1⁄4 or 1⁄2 inch (0.6 or 1.3 cm) mesh is fine. For suckers or carp, poultry netting (chicken wire) is less expensive.

, You will need four pieces the length of your intended box, four pieces of your intended height and four of your intended width. For example, a trap that is 12 inches (30.5 cm) tall, 24 inches (61.0 cm) wide and 48 inches (121.9 cm) long would require four 12-inch pieces of lumber, four 24-inch pieces and four 48-inch pieces. Larger or smaller traps would require the same amount of longer or shorter lumber pieces, respectively.

, First create two squares with the smaller lengths, with similar-sized pieces parallel to one another. After you nail the two squares together, connect them with the four longer pieces of wood, creating a box frame.

, A 12 inch (30.5 cm) X 24 inch (61.0 cm) X 48 inch (121.9 cm) trap will require a sheet of wire 6 feet (1.8 m) long and 4 feet (1.2 m) wide.

, Create a 90-degree corner around each slat of wood by folding the mesh around the outer corner of your frame.Tie the two edges of the sheet together with plastic ""snap ties"" or light gauge wire.

, The piece would be a 12 X 24 inches rectangle in this example. Secure the sheet in place with the same ties or wire you seamed the box in the previous step. A larger or smaller trap will require wire fabric equal to its width by its height., Use the same type of wire mesh. The larger funnel opening should be large enough to attach it to the slats of your box, tapering down to leave an opening facing the inside of the box that is just large enough for your target fish to swim into the trap, but not escape.In this example, the larger side of the funnel could be a 12 X 24-inch oval, and the smaller end might have a diameter of only 5 inches, varying based on the size of fish you hope to trap.

, Place an ""onion bag"", or mesh fruit bag, filled with your bait into the trap, along with a large stone or piece of brick to weight the trap down. Common bait used for catfish is chicken liver, corn or even dog food. Other fish species should be baited with food they find most attractive., Instead of using zip ties, use wire that can be untied later to release or remove your catch, then retied for future use., The line should both withstand its time underwater and be strong enough it can withhold the weight of the trap and any fish inside. You will use the line to pull your trap out of the water when you are ready to check it, so it should be at least 15 feet long., Take the whole apparatus, including the bait inside, to the fishing hole you plan to place it. Then simply drop the trap in the water in your chosen location. Secure the other end of the rope on the bank.An ideal spot for a catfish trap will have little current. Choose a protected spot in a slow-moving river, a large pond, or the edge of a lake., Pull the trap in slowly when you decide to check it, keeping in mind you never know what will be inside it. At the least, check the trap daily to make sure no turtles, otters or other predators have discovered it and either damaged it or gotten trapped inside.

Decide what kind of spinner blades you want to use.,
Decide what kind of skirt material you want to use.",How to Make Musky Lures1," There are several types of spinner blades available, each with its own properties, as listed below:


Willow leaf. Willow leaf blades have a pointed teardrop shape that lets them reflect light more than the other types without snagging or fouling.
Indiana. Similar to the willow leaf blade but with rounded ends. Some Indiana blades feature ribbing in the center to add flash and turbulence.
Colorado. These wide, teardrop-shaped blades are designed to produce more turbulence than willow leaf or Indiana blades. They often feature a golf-ball-like surface that maximizes turbulence and provides extra flash.
Propeller. Propeller blades for French and safety-pin spinners are shaped like rounded triangles with the ends bent. They provide more turbulence than the other blade types and are designed so that the spinner shaft runs through them, so that they don't require a U-shaped clevis to put them on the spinner.;
, Just as you have a choice of blades for making your spinner, you also have a choice of what material to make its skirt with. Some of the types available are listed below:


Bucktail. So named because it comes from a deer's tail. Commonly used for spinners fished in colder waters.
Squirrel tail hair. This material was commonly used by Mepps for the skirts of its double-armed safety-pin spinners.
Marabou. Named for the marabou stork, this material is more commonly made from turkey feathers. It's used for jigs as well as French spinners.
Flashabou. A synthetic marabou that includes strips of reflective material.

Check the trap.",How to Make a Crawfish Trap," The brand does not matter, but they should be clean and intact. Rinse the bottles out with a sink or hose before using. Remove any paper labels that might come off into the water when wet.

If you don't rinse the bottles or remove the sticker, you risk contaminating the stream or pond where you're trapping the crawfish.;
, Use scissors or a sharp knife to cut the bottle open around its circumference. Make the cut about half an inch above the halfway point. Make sure that the edge is even and smooth all the way around the bottle.

, Make the incision a few inches higher up from the corresponding point where you cut the first bottle. The bottles will need to fit into one another, so make sure that the edges are clean.

, Build a funnel-like ramp for the crawfish to crawl into the bottle.First, unscrew the lid of the smaller bottle top. Fit the lid and ""top"" of this smaller bottle into the open end of the larger bottle piece. This way, you'll have a wide opening for the crawfish to crawl into the ""bottom"", but it will be difficult for the creature to find its way back out., You will use these holes to tie the inner and outer bottle together into a crawfish trap. Make sure that the bottles stay together. The holes should line up through the inner and outer bottle. Use a power drill, an awl, or any other safe perforation tool.


Drill the holes very carefully. Make sure that the bottles don't slip while you're drilling, or else the holes will not line up.
Be very cautious if you use a knife or awl. It can be difficult to make a clean hole straight through a two-liter bottle, let alone through two. The surface is slick, and a knife can easily slip. If possible, use a drill.

, Each new hole should be about a centimeter directly above one of the original holes. You will thread a string or zip tie through the top and bottom holes in order to tie to the bottles together.


Alternately, you can use only the first set of holes. In this case, you will simply thread the zip ties through this first set, then fasten them on the outside of the bottle rim.

, From the outside of the trap, run a zip tie through one of the lower holes. Then, thread it out through the adjacent top hole. Tighten the zip tie so that it holds the trap together. Repeat until you have fastened five zip ties all the way around the bottle. There should be no gaps between the bottles, and the rig should not be loose.

, Use a pair of scissors to snip the extra length off of each of the zip ties. This step is not essential, but it will make your trap tighter and cleaner. You may find that mud, weeds, and other gunk get stuck on loose zip tie ends.

, Crawfish tend to spend their time along the bottom of shallow rivers and brooks.The added weight will make the trap sink to the bottom so that crawfish are more likely to wander inside. Poke a small hole through the very bottom of the trap, then tie on a lead fishing weight with a small zip tie.


You may need to experiment with the weight to make sure that the trap sinks all the way to the bottom – but 1-5 pounds should do the trick.

, Use the same weight size that you used on the bottom, or something slightly lighter. This will keep the trap balanced at the bottom of the stream. If only the bottom is weighted, the opening of the trap may get stuck in the mud.

, Unscrew the top cap, and drop the bait into the chamber. When you've set the bait, screw the top cap back on so that the crawfish cannot escape. Use fish to mimic the natural diet of the crawfish. Many Swedish fishermen use sunfish, shiners, and herring; Cajun fishermen traditionally use gizzard shad and pogies; West Coast fishermen often use salmon heads and other oily fish. If possible, use fish caught in the same body of water where you're trying to catch the crawfish.If you don't have access to any fish, you can use raw meat: a piece of uncooked bacon, chicken, or hot dog can do the trick. Do not expect this bait to be as effective as fish.

, You can tie a string underneath the lid, or you can attach it to one of the zip ties. Consider drilling two more small holes, then threading the rope through these holes. This rope should keep the trap from floating off downstream. You will use it to adjust and harvest the trap.

, First, tie the rope to a tree, a post, or another sturdy object to hold the trap in place. Finally, toss the trap a few feet out into the water, and make sure that it sinks. Check the rope to make sure that it's sturdy. Leave the trap in the stream overnight: crawfish tend to be most active in the dark, so you will be more likely to catch one overnight than during the day.In theory, the crawfish smell food and climb through the lid. When they want to get out, they can't figure out how to climb back through the hole to freedom.
If you only wait a few hours or overnight, the crawfish should survive on the bait until you check the trap. If you wait much longer than a day or two, the crawfish might starve to death by the time that you come around. Be aware that the crawfish may not be able to breathe., When you return the next day, pull the trap out of the water by hauling on the rope. If it feels heavier than it should, it may be full of crawfish, or it may have sunk into the mud of the riverbed. Pull the trap out of the water and examine your catch!To empty the trap, simply unscrew the top cap of the bottle, then pour the crawfish into a bucket or net.

Cut two equal lengths of lawnmower cable coil.,
Create an extender for your fly-tying vise.,
Cut your skirt material in half.,
Divide the cut half into two parts, one being twice the size of the other.,
Make the underskirt.,
Make the overskirt.",How to Make Musky Lures2," You'll wrap your skirt components around these coils.

, You'll do this with a leftover piece of spinner shaft wire.


First, make a 90-degree bend on one end of the wire.
After making the bend, thread a length of lawnmower cable coil onto the wire past the bend.
Finally, lock the thread into your vise.

, You'll need only half the length of the material for your skirt. (You can save the rest for another spinner.)

, You'll be making two skirts for your spinner, an underskirt and an overskirt. Use the larger portion for the underskirt and the smaller for the overskirt.

, Evenly distribute the strands of skirt material around the cable coil, then tie them to the coil at its middle.


As you tie the strands in place, periodically coat the tying string with head cement before adding another layer of strands. Be sure the strands lay flat against the coil and cover it completely.
Finish by tying several half-hitches in the tying string, and cover it with 2 coats of head cement, pausing to let the first coat dry before adding the second. Let it dry thoroughly before continuing.

, Place the other coil on your tying vise as described previously, then cut the strands of material for the overskirt in half again. Tie them to their coil by their bases instead of in the middle as you did for the underskirt; cement the tying string periodically as you did for the underskirt and again when finishing tying.


Be sure both the underskirt and overskirt have a nice, full appearance.

Heat-shrink the tubing in place.,
Slip two spacer beads onto the spinner shaft.

,

Thread the overskirt onto the shaft, followed by a decorative bead.

,
Slip another treble hook, on a split ring, onto the shaft.,
Add the lure body, followed by more decorative beads.

,
Add the spinner blade(s).,
Bend the tag end of the spinner shaft into an eye.",How to Make Musky Lures3,", Thread the tubing down far enough to cover the looped end of the shaft, the split ring, and the hook shank. The tubing is to keep the hook from fouling on the spinner body during the cast.

, You can use a butane lighter or art torch. Heat the tubing only enough to shrink it, not melt it, then let it cool before continuing.

,, The skirt coil should rest on top of the spacer beads, while the skirt itself should hide the beads and just reach the bends of the treble hook. If it doesn't, remove the skirt and add or subtract spacer beads until it does.

,, This forward treble hook will help you catch muskies that hit the spinner in the middle.

,, If you're using willow leaf, Indiana, or Colorado (teardrop-shaped blades), you'll probably want two blades for more flash and turbulence. If you're using a propeller blade, you'll probably be satisfied with just one; although if you're using a squat style, you may want two.


If you're using a teardrop-shaped blade, thread a clevis through the hole in the blade top and slip the clevis on the shaft, making sure the convex side of the blade is out and the concave side faces the spinner shaft.
If you're using a propeller blade, thread it directly onto the shaft with the blades facing the body and skirt.
You may want to use spacer or decorative beads to put some distance between multiple blades. Don't put so much space between the blades, however, that you prevent them from touching each other, as an accidental slapping of blades can draw fish.

, You'll need pliers for this.


Grab the spinner above the top blade with the pliers. With your free hand, bend the shaft around the tip of the pliers, forming an eye.
Wrap the tag end around the shaft four times, closing the eye. Trim the end with wire cutters and file the cut if necessary.

Hook a minnow through its lips when trolling or when repeatedly casting and retrieving.,
Hook a minnow through its back when still fishing.,
Hook a minnow through its tail when fishing it without any weight or bobber.,
Choose the right hook.,
Tie direct.,
Use thinner line in clear water.,
Maintain a cool temperature.,
Keep the water clean.,
Consider an aerator.,
Don’t overcrowd your minnows.",How to Hook a Minnow," Hooking a minnow this way lets it swim naturally when being pulled through the water.








Rigs that call for lip-looked minnows include live-bait rigs such as a sliding weight or drop-shot rig, as well as with a sinker and bobber. You can also hook a minnow this way on a jig head to “sweeten” the lure.When hooking a minnow through the lips, thread the hook through first the lower, then the upper lip. Because the hook will turn point up, this will let the minnow swim upright.
Hooking a minnow through the lips will prevent water from entering its mouth and exiting its gills, causing it to eventually die. Check live minnows hooked this way often and replace them when they show signs of dying.;
, Hooking a minnow through the back, just behind its dorsal fin, lets it swim more naturally when rigged under a sinker to keep it under the water and a bobber about 18 inches (45 cm) ahead of the minnow to keep it from going down too far.








This method is also recommended for using minnows as bait on a tip-up when ice fishing. A minnow hooked through the back can survive longer than one hooked through the lips.However, if you pierce the minnow’s spine when hooking it this way, you’ll paralyze it.

, This lets the minnow swim as freely as possible when it is not pulling any weight other than that of the hook.








Fishing a minnow with an unweighted line works best when casting to a specific target or when fishing for fish suspended in trees or near a boat dock.Some anglers also use the tail hook method when using a very light sinker on the line., The size of hook you use depends on how large the minnows you’re fishing are.









For minnows under 3 inches (7.5 cm), a size 4 or size 6 hook works best. For minnows 4 to 5 inches (10 to 12.5 cm) or larger, you can go as large as a size 2, 1/0, or even 2/0. ., Although snap swivels make it easier to change hooks and lures, they also add extra weight that can upset the minnow’s swimming action.









You can, however, rig either a barrel swivel or a three-way swivel some distance ahead of the hook to fish with either a sliding sinker (using the barrel swivel as a stop) or a dipsey sinker or split shot (with the three-way swivel).

, Lines of 6 to 8 pound test (3 to 4 kg class) are recommended when fishing clear rivers or lakes.








, Minnows thrive best in cool water or water of a temperature no higher than that of the water they’re being fished in.









Cooler water holds more oxygen than warmer water. Keeping your minnow bucket out of direct sunlight will keep the water cooler.
If the water in the minnow bucket is in danger of getting too warm, you can add ice in small amounts. Too much ice at once, however, will cool the water too rapidly and will send the minnows into shock, eventually killing them.
If the temperature of the water in which you’re fishing sharply differs from that of the minnow bucket, temper the bucket water by gradually adding outside water to the bucket. Although some minnow buckets are designed to be immersed in the water you’re fishing, doing so before tempering the water gradually will shock and kill the minnows., Just as with caring for fish in an aquarium, you need to filter and change the water in your minnow bucket when keeping minnows in it for a long period of time.









If your minnow bucket water comes from a city tap, add a few drops of de-chlorinating solution to take out any chlorine present in the water.
If the bucket water turns cloudy, change it immediately to remove the ammonia built up from the fishes’ waste excretions., Portable aerators add oxygen to the water in the minnow bucket, which can help keep your minnows alive longer. Aerators typically run on batteries, but some may include adapters to connect them to a 12-volt battery.









Some aerators let you adjust the level of oxygen they deliver to the water. Generally, you want to maintain an output of tiny bubbles, which carry more oxygen, and don’t push the fish around the way larger bubbles might.
Choose an aerator that runs as quietly as possible to avoid disturbing you when you’re fishing., Too many baitfish in too small a bucket leads to increased competition for the available oxygen in the water and increases the amount of waste ammonia.









A 1-gallon (3.79 l) minnow bucket can handle up to 6 dozen 3/4 to 1 inch (19.1 to to 25 mm) fathead minnows, 4 to 5 dozen 2 to 3 1/2 inch (50 to 88.9 mm) shiner minnows, and 1 to 1 1/2 dozen chubs of 3 1/2 inches (88.9 mm) or larger.
For very large baitfish, such as 10 to 18-inch (25 to 45.72 cm) suckers, a 5-gallon (18.93 l) bucket is recommended."

Build a worm bed.,
Fill the bed with peat moss.,
Water the peat moss.,
Fill the bed with worms.,
Keep the bed temperature above freezing.,
Ensure an adequate oxygen supply.,
Feed your worms regularly.,
Replace half the soil every 6 months.",How to Grow Your Own Fishing Worms," Building a bed to raise earthworms enables you to keep the soil in which you raise the worms contained. You have a choice of several materials to make your bed from, as well as the bed's size.


You can build the bed whatever size you're comfortable with. A good size is 3 to 6 feet (0.9 to 1.8 m) long, 2 to 4 feet (0.6 to 1.2 m) wide, and 12 to 24 inches (30 to 60 cm) thick.
You can build the bed either inside or outdoors, depending on your local climate. The bed should be somewhere at ground level in a shady spot where it won't freeze during cold weather. You don't need to make a bottom for the bed unless you make it small enough to lift; as long as the worms are fed regularly, they'll be less likely to escape. You may, however, add a roof to divert rain, as long as you provide a means to water the bed, or a wire mesh covering if you live in an area with anteaters or armadillos.
Wood is a good, natural choice for making a bed. You can use 1 x 12s for the sides. As you can simply replace a rotting board after a time, it isn't necessary to use pressure-treated lumber.
Cinder block can also be used for the frame of a worm bed, provided you plan to keep the bed in the same spot outdoors all the time.
Staked-in-place wire mesh also works for making a worm bed; however, you'll need to line the sides with burlap to reduce the likelihood of escape while still letting the worm bed breathe.
If you choose not to make an actual bed, a polystyrene foam cooler also works for a worm bed.;
, There should be enough moss in the bed to provide sufficient cover from sunlight, in addition to shade above the bed, to keep the worms from drying out in the sun's heat. Filling the bed at least half-full of peat moss should be sufficient.

, A good initial soaking with a garden hose, followed by regular watering to keep the moss moist at all times, is what you want. Ideally, you should keep the soil as moist as a damp sponge.


Don't apply so much water that you leave standing water after you're done. Too much water will drown the worms.

, Choose a species of earthworm suited to your local climate. You can buy worms from either a bait and tackle shop or from a wholesale distributor. You want to have about 2 dozen worms per square foot of your worm bed.

, Worms will try to crawl out of soil that is too cold and will shrivel and die in soil that is too hot. You want to keep the soil at a temperature between 40 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit (5 to 10 degrees Celsius).

, The peat moss or other bedding should remain loose enough to allow air to penetrate the soil. If you have to use non-porous materials for the frame of your worm bed, provide air holes to further encourage air circulation.


Temperature also has an effect on oxygen levels. The warmer the soil or water gets, the less oxygen it can hold.

, Although worms will extract nutrients from the soil they are in, you should supplement those nutrients by composting the soil with such things as coffee grounds, grass clippings, manure, oat or cornmeal, or wet leaves. Use 1 pound (.454 kg) of compost material for every pound of worms in your bed. (Some anglers who grow their own worms recommend putting the compost food into the bedding soil before adding the worms to it.)


Too much feed will generate heat, which will cause the worms to dehydrate. While still wet, excess food can grow web fungus, drawing in ants, mites, and roaches, which in turn can draw in creatures that feed on these pests, such as anteaters or armadillos.

, Using a stiff rake, comb through the bed to force the worms to one side. Take out the soil from which you have separated out the worms and use it to fertilize your lawn; replace it in the worm bed with fresh peat moss.

Decide on a style of fishing.,
Consider your experience.,
Look for saltwater rods, not freshwater.,
Visit a brick-and-mortar store.,
Choose a type of rod.,
Test its weight.,
Decide on a length.,
Consider the rod’s action.,
Check the rod’s power.,
Match your other equipment to the rod.",How to Choose a Sea Fishing Rod," Expect certain rods to perform better in specific scenarios and with specific fish. Determine which type of fishing you will be engaged in: surf, pier, inshore, offshore, trolling, or ice. Make sure that you are buying the right tool for the job to ensure the best performance.Surf fishing: standing on the shoreline and casting your line beyond the breakers.

Pier fishing: casting from a pier or other structure that projects from shore over the water.

Inshore fishing: fishing in shallow waters less than 98 feet deep (30 meters), typically only a few miles or kilometers from land.

Offshore fishing: fishing in deeper waters, possibly 30 to 130 miles away from land (48 to 209 km).

Trolling: dropping a line into the water from a moving boat instead of casting from a fixed point.

Ice fishing: dropping a line into a hole cut through the ice that covers the water’s surface.;
, Bear in mind that some rods are better suited for novices. Understand that even though a particular rod may be considered the best one for, say, surf fishing, its design may not lend itself well to learning the basic maneuvers of fishing, like casting. Unless you are already well practiced, choose a rod that will allow you to master the basics, rather than one that requires you to have already mastered them.If you are a beginner, search for “combos,” which are customized for each type of fishing and include not only the rod, but the equipment best matched for it as well, such as reel, line, and tackle., Even though a rod alone can be used in either type of water when it's stripped down to just the pole, understand that all of the accompanying parts must be designed specifically to withstand saltwater. Choose between saltwater rods only to ensure that your equipment won’t corrode. In addition to the pole itself, other parts include:Guides: the loops along the length of the pole, through which the line is fed. These include the “tip-top,” which, as the name implies, is the last guide at the very top of the pole.

Grips: the area by which the pole is held.

Seats: the area where the reel is attached.

, Even if you plan on looking for better deals online, go to an actual fishing-supply store first so you can speak with the staff. Tell them the style of fishing that you plan to do, the type of fish that you hope to catch, and your experience-level. Ask for their advice in what features to look for in a suitable rod that will match your specific needs, especially if you choose to buy other equipment (reel, line, and lures) separately instead of as a combo.


Also share your budget. Prices may range from as low as $35 to over $600.

, Narrow your search according to the exact type of fishing that you are interested in. Choose between rods that are either specifically designed for that purpose or otherwise well suited for it. Types of rods include:Surfcasting: with these, the emphasis is on length so that the line reaches past the breakers when cast.

Spinning/casting: accommodates continuous casting and retrievals.

Conventional: more compact and resilient to handle heavier fish.

Trolling: designed to be used with a fighting belt or chair for very heavy fish.

Ice: the shortest of rods, since no casting is required.

, Obviously, you want a rod that you can comfortably cast and handle when reeling in fish. Take a few practice casts without any line to judge how it feels in your hand. Check the material from which it is made. Expect most rods to be made of either fiberglass or graphite.Choose graphite for the lightest rod, which also allows you to feel the fish’s movements with more sensitivity.
If you are a beginner, consider fiberglass, since these rods require less maintenance.

, Expect fishing rods to stand anywhere from 3 to 15 feet (1 to 4.5 meters), or even higher. Favor a longer length to cast long distances. However, for heavier fish that put up a fight, choose a more compact rod for its extra strength. Other factors to consider are:Whether you need to cast the line or merely drop it into the water.
How far you need to cast the line to reach the target area.
Your own height, since the longest rod available will be more difficult to manage if you are shorter than average or not yet fully grown.
The added weight that comes with extra length.
Whether you will be crowded by people or objects while casting, in which case shorter is best.

, Understand that “action” refers to the rod’s flexibility. Select between the three classifications: fast, medium, and slow. Base your choice on the size of fish you aim to catch, as well as the conditions that you will be fishing in.Fast: mostly rigid with only the very tip offering any flexibility. Fast-action is best suited for heavy fish and equipment (line, lure, reels). Its lack of flexibility also makes it ideal for windy conditions. It produces a very forceful cast that will cover long distances. However, it is difficult to use without prior experience.

Medium: rigid along the bottom half with more bend along the top. It produces moderately long casts with greater accuracy than fast rods, and is also capable of shorter casts. The rigid bottom offers resistance against the wind and can handle all but the extreme sizes of fish, large or small. Novices who are eager to experience a wide variety of fishing should begin with this.

Slow: bends along the entire length of the rod. It is only suitable for small fish, light equipment, and fair weather. Its cast is short, but also very precise. For a beginner, this is the easiest action to start with.

, Understand that “power” refers here to the amount of weight that the pole can handle without breaking. Decide on which size of fish you wish to catch. Select a rod with the appropriate amount of power. Note that a rod's power may vary from brand to brand, so ask sales staff for assistance in determining the best rod per brand for the fish you wish to catch.Expect rods to be categorized as:Ultra-light
Light
Medium-light
Medium
Medium-heavy
Heavy
Ultra-heavy

, If you are purchasing the rod by itself instead of opting for a combo package that includes a reel, line, and lures, make sure that you purchase the right items for your rod. Check the line weight that it recommends. Purchase a reel that is also meant for that exact weight. Only use fishing line of that weight in that reel. Also be sure that your bait or tackle is meant to be used with that line weight.Mismatching light line with a reel and rod meant for heavy line, or vice versa, can result in damaged equipment.
Remember to make sure that each additional part is meant for saltwater fishing, not freshwater.

Use slow moving baits and slow moving presentation when fishing in the Winter or the cold.,
Break Spring into 4 segments called pre-spawn, spawn, post-spawn, and late Spring.,
Fish along the shore early in the morning during the Summer and off of structures during the day.,
Fish the first cool night of the Fall.,
Analyze the terrain.",How to Choose Lures for Bass Fishing1," With lower temperatures, bass will not expend much effort and will only bite when your lure is immediately within their strike zone.;
, Pre-spawn means that bass will be around the 8–15 feet (2.4–4.6 m) depth, spawn means they will move up to their spawning beds, post-spawn means they will move back down to 8-15 feet, and the late spring has bass moving towards the shore early in the morning and out towards structures later.


Pre-spawn occurs when waters climb to around the 45 degree mark. Spawn occurs when water is between 55 and 65 degrees. Post spawn occurs at different times and doesn't happen to an entire lake due to differences in water temperatures. Late Spring is basically the beginning of summer when temperatures climb upwards of 80 and 90 degrees.

, When fishing in the Summer, bass will be closer to the shore early in the morning to feed then move into open water around creek channels and structures.


They will school together and feed on shad near the top of the water so it's best to use topwater, plastics, jigs, and even lipless crankbaits.

, As the temperature drops in the Fall, bass will be feeding closer to shore but will show more erratic behavior. The first cool night of Fall is a good time to look for a feeding frenzy as bass prepare for the upcoming cold months., Depending on the weather and which phase of their mating cycle they are in, bass may like to stay close to certain areas or hide within debris. Vegetation, rocky bottoms, shallow flats, fallen trees, structures, bushes and grass can all provide ample places to cast. Research the swimming habits that may correspond to the time and place that you are fishing.

Choose a length.,
Decide on a weight.,
Understand the action.,
Decide on a material.,
Choose a reel.",How to Choose a Fishing Rod1," The length of a rod is measured from the tip all the way to the end of the butt. Fishing rods range in length from about four feet all the way up to fourteen feet. Larger rods often dissemble into several pieces for easier transportation. Depending on where you will be fishing and what you will be fishing for, you will need to choose a rod length.


Shorter rods cast shorter distances and are usually used for lightweight lures. They also allow you better manipulation when you are fighting with a fish, so may be appropriate for big game fishing. They are also useful when trolling, a type of fishing where the line is attached to a moving boat and drawn across the water. Longer rods cast further distances and, therefore, are useful for surfcasting, which is when you are fishing directly from the shoreline rather than a boat or pier. Longer rods are also used in fly fishing and for heavier lures. ;
, The weight of a rod tells you how much weight it can carry, and therefore how strong it is. Depending on what lures or bait you will be using, you will need a specific strength rod. The weight is measured either by the weight of the lure it is designed to cast, or the ""pound test"". The pound test is the fishing line weight it is designed to handle. , The action of a rod is the point on the rod where it bends. This measurement can range from ""ultra light"" to ""heavy"". A heavy action means it bends closer to the tip while a lighter action bends closer to the butt of the rod. A heavier action means a stiffer backbone on the rod.This means it is recommended for use with bass or other large species of fish. A lighter action rod is usually used with smaller species of fish.

, Fishing rods are made of graphite, fiberglass, or a combination of both materials. The material that your rod is made of is related to its functionality and the kind of fishing that you will be doing.


Graphite rods are lighter and stiffer, but much more brittle than fiberglass rods. They are much more sensitive, as well, because of this. Graphite rods are usually more expensive than fiberglass rods. Fiberglass rods are heavier, but much more flexible than graphite rods. They are very difficult to break. They are also usually the less expensive option when choosing a rod material.
A combination of both materials is ideal for a fisherman who fishes in a variety of locations, for multiple types of fish.

, Rods are also determined by what kind of reel you will be using. Reels are either spinning or casting. The different kinds of reels correspond to a fisherman's different needs.


A spinning reel is like automatic transmission on a car. It allows less control but is ideal for beginners because it allows for a greater rate of success. Spinning reels are less likely to get tangled. They work well with lighter lures and baits and are good all-purpose rods. A casting reel is similar to a manual transmission on a car. It allows more control as you use your thumbs to control the accuracy of the cast. This, however, makes it more difficult to use. They are also used more often with heavier artificial lures.

Slip a bullet sinker, preferably made from something other than lead, such as brass or ceramic, onto your line by inserting the line into the pointed end of the sinker.,
Tie on an offset worm hook using your favorite fishing knot.

,
Insert about 1/4 of an inch of the point of the hook straight into the top of the worm.

,
Turn the hook point and exit the worm at the side of the head.

,
Slide the worm up the hook toward the eye, twisting it around the hook wire as you slide it, so that the point of the hook will be facing the worm.,
Allow the worm to hang straight down and put your finger and thumb on the worm right at the point that the bend of the hook reaches.

,
Keeping your thumb and finger on that spot, bend the worm so that you can insert the point of the hook into the worm at a right angle.,
Push the point all the way through the worm.,
Now push up on the worm just a little so you can slip the point of the hook just under the surface of the plastic.

,
Once the point is hidden beneath the surface, the Texas Rig is called ""weedless"" or ""skin-hooked"".",How to Texas Rig a Plastic Worm,";
,,,,


The eye of the hook should be just at the top of the worm. The offset should hold the main wire of the hook outside the worm so the worm can hang straight down toward the point.

,, Make sure you keep the worm straight so the hook is going back into the same side of the worm that it came out of up top.

, When you are done doing this, the worm should make a straight line between the point and the eye of the hook.

,, Rigged like this, the worm will slip through weeds without getting snagged, but it is still easy to set the hook.

Utilize crankbaits when you want to cover a lot of water.,
Examine how deep you will be fishing.,
Examine the water conditions.,
Choose the shape of your crankbait.,
Match your line with the diving depth.,
Limit the colors.",How to Choose Lures for Bass Fishing2," These lures are quite versatile. You can use them in light vegetation, rocky bottoms, shallow flats, and through bushes and grass.


Many crankbaits include rattles that helps bass find the bait.
Another good feature to look for on a crankbait is very visible eyes. Glowing eyes seem to work best as predatory fish target the eyes when striking.
Crankbaits come either lipless or with a lip and each is effective dependant on depth and the speed at which you reel.

, Use lipless crankbaits if you’re fishing in 1 foot of water or if you’re fishing as deep as 50 feet. You will have to reel faster or use a lighter lure in shallow water, whereas you will reel slower or use a heavier lure when fishing deeper water.Use a specific lipped crankbait depending on the depth of the water because they are classified as shallow, medium or deep diving based on a 10 pound nylon monofilament or fluorocarbon line.Use square bill crankbaits or crankbaits with round, stubby lips and sharp angled off noses when fishing for bass in shallow water, around wood or rock.Deploy medium-diving crankbaits when fishing in a 5-10 foot range. If you’re fishing 12 feet or deeper, use deep-diving crankbaits.

, Lipless crankbaits can easily be ripped out of grass or bumped along a clean bottom whereas a lipped crankbait will hit something and kick outwards because the lip acts as a deflector.Use lipped crankbaits when fishing through wood cover like tree limbs or stumps.

, The shape of your crankbait determines how much movement you will get, which is important depending on the temperature of the water as bass are less active in colder temperatures.


With a more rounded-bodied crankbait you’ll get a wide wobble that is attractive to bass that are aggressive, usually when water is warmer; in contrast, a flat crankbait with narrow sides will have a tighter wiggle that is more appealing to bass in cold water who won’t react to large movements., Pair the correct size of line with your crankbait according to how deep you want the bait to run.


For example, use a 10 pound fluorocarbon line to lighten up a deep diving crankbait or you can use the same 10 pound fluorocarbon line to get a medium diving cranbait to stay at its deepest range., Crankbaits come in the full spectrum of colours but stick to the basics of bass fishing. Choose bright shad patterns, dull shad patterns, bluegills, crawfish, and contrasting patterns.Shad patterns work well in bright sunlight with the more muted patterns becoming more effective in cloudy but clear water.Crawfish works well in the spring as well as for bass in shallow water.
Bluegill works well for bass that are feeding on bream during their post spawn period or if they are around docks.

Utilize spinnerbaits when covering a lot of water quickly.,
Choose the right blades.,
Examine the water conditions.,
Match your line with the diving depth.,
Limit the colors.",How to Choose Lures for Bass Fishing3," Thanks to their unique blade shape, they can dive, retrieve quickly, and even weave through thick cover.Choose spinnerbaits in standard or weedless. A weedless spinnerbait is a good option if you are fishing in a lot of cover, but are also harder to set the hook on. Add a cheater hook to catch short striking fish.

, There are 3 major blade types: leaf, Colorado, and Indiana. Each blade type is effective for different conditions.


The leaf blade is most effective when fishing through grass and in clear water when you want a fast retrieval. It is a long slender blade with rounded points on either end to allow a faster spin and less water resistance.Deploy the Colorado blade when fishing at night or in muddy and murky water. The rounded shape allows it to spin slower giving the bass more opportunity to bite.Utilize the Indiana blade as a compromise to the slower Colorado blade and faster leaf blade.

, Check for debris or water clarity to ensure that you’re using the most effective blades.


The larger the blade means that it is easier to maneuver around stumps, rocks, and other debris, while narrow blades move quickly through sparse grass.Spinner baits work best when it’s windy and cloudy because they are meant to cause a reaction from the bass. Use faster spinner baits in clearer water and slower ones in muddier water., Choose lighter spinnerbaits for shallow water while heavier lures should be used for deeper depths. The weight will range from ⅛ ounce to 2 ounces.Remember that the slower you reel, the deeper your lure will swim while reeling fast keeps your lure shallow.Blade size also affects how deep your lure will go but you can also add a trailer to your hook for buoyancy and movement., While there are an abundance of colors to choose from, it’s best to keep it simple. Choose clear shad, bright chartreuse with white and black for night fishing or fishing in muddy water.Some anglers are successful with painted blades to give some extra flash.

"

Employ topwaters when fishing in very shallow water, or in areas that are covered in surface vegetation such as lily pads.,
Choose the right topwater lure for your water conditions.,
Employ the right technique.,
Keep the colors simple.",How to Choose Lures for Bass Fishing4," These lures are meant to ripple the water surface with popping and splashing as you retrieve it.In the spring, bright colors work best. In the fall and winter, black, white or gray work well.
Choose topwaters that produce a lot of noise and splash to get the bass' attention.

, Topwater lures come in walkers, poppers, wakebaits, minnows/twitch baits, prop baits, buzzbaits, and frogs. Each different type of topwater lure is most effective in different conditions.Walkers are most effective when covering a lot of top water quickly because it keeps the bait in striking distance for the bass.
Poppers should be deployed when fishing around stumps, docks, bushes, rocks, and small areas that are covered because these lures will aggravate bass into biting.
Wakebaits work best in clear water when fish are attracted to the V shaped wake.
Minnows/twitch baits excel in clear lakes or small areas where bass may spook at aggressive lures. They are great during spawning when bass are guarding their nests.
Prop baits should be used in places with a lot of grass, especially during spawning season. They create a lot of movement even without moving a great distance, which keeps them in a bass’ striking range longer.
Buzzbaits should be used in sparse grass and places where you feel your lure might get snagged but you still want a topwater presentation. These are most effective after spawning during the late summer.
Frogs are meant to mimic real frogs so use them effectively around heavy grass. They can also be used around cover as they are one of the toughest lures to snag.

, Topwater lures are meant to simultaneously activate the feeding and agitation response from bass but require you to mimic fleeing or helpless prey with erratic movements.Create a back-and-forth or zig zag pattern on the surface of the water when you employ a walker lure. Snap your wrist and rod tip downward at a sharp angle and then point the rod tip back to the lure quickly so it glides. Give a series of fast snaps to make the bait move from left to right.
Snap your rod tip downward to activate a poppers concave mouth and narrow tail.
Steadily retrieve your wakebait to utilize its sharp angled lip to cause it to shimmy back and forth.
Twitch and float minnows/twitch baits back to the surface to attract bass guarding their nests during spawning.
Use a series of short jerks on your rod to spray water with prop baits.
Steadily retrieve your buzzbait to employ its blade to curl the water, spitting and spraying during quick jerks.
Twitch frogs along the top of grass and water to get bass to explode onto your lure.

, While there are a variety of colours for each of these baits, it's best to go with black, white, green and yellow."

Employ a short-range flipping and pitching techniques instead of casting out into the distance when using jigs.,
Employ proper technique.,
Examine the water conditions.,
Keep the colors simple.",How to Choose Lures for Bass Fishing5," These lures give you a very accurate feel on the line, and are one of the most effective lures. The common plastic skirting attracts bass all year round.Bass will usually hit a bait while it is falling, so after it has sat on the bottom for a bit give the rod tip a small twitch to see if anything has picked up your bait.

, To fish a jig cast out and give the line plenty of time to hit the bottom. Jigs and plastics are fished differently than other types of lures. Instead of reeling in to produce the ""action"", the bait is retrieved by moving the rod tip.


After the bait has hit the bottom and you have given it a twitch, slowly lift the rod tip until it points straight up in the 12 o'clock position. Let it sit there for a moment and then drop it down to the 9 - 10 o'clock position and reel in the slack. Repeat these steps until your line is in.
You'll have to have a good feel for your line to tell when a fish is biting so most people hold their finger against the line while lifting the rod tip.
Look for sudden resistance or bumping on the line, a line that goes slack suddenly or veers sideways. To set the hook, drop the rod tip very quickly to the 3 o'clock position, and pull back hard to 12 o'clock.

, Jigs are most effective when employed in cover or closed to cover so be aware of the risk of getting snagged. Jigs are meant to imitate crawfish so try to make them scoot along the bottom.Both jigs and plastic worms are best used slowly.
Use jigs around fallen trees where bass are hiding.
Brush piles on a rocky bottom, standing timber, thick grass, and flats are all prime locations to employ a jig.
Pitch or flip a jig around the angles where limbs connect to the trunks of fallen trees. Let the jig fall to the bottom with a semi-tight line.
Drag or hop your jig down ledges or drops to mimic the movements of a crawfish.
Use a ¾ ounce jig when fishing through thick grass.
Jigs are also effective when fishing on docks and piers because they provide protection from predators.

, Jigs are meant to imitate crawfish so they should be light in clear water and dark in murky water.

Choose where to buy your rod.,
Determine what level fisherman you are.,
Determine where you will be fishing.,
Decide what kind of bait you will be using.",How to Choose a Fishing Rod2," Where you buy your rod will greatly determine the quality and value you get for your rod. While it is tempting to shop for the best deal, make sure you are visiting a specialty sporting goods store where they will have a wide selection of fishing rods. A smaller store will allow you to have a greater rapport with a salesperson or specialist if you have questions.


Be careful of buying your rod online. Unless you have tried it out in the store first, it will be difficult to find the best fishing rod for you by shopping online. You will be unable to feel the rod in your hand or examine the quality if you have only viewed it online.
Don't be afraid of asking for help. If you visit a quality sporting goods store, the salespeople will likely have experience with the products. They can help you find the perfect fit if you explain your needs and desired specifications.

, If you are a beginner and planning of fishing less frequently, consider buying a less expensive rod. If you are more seasoned, consider investing in something that will last longer.


Spinning rods are also ideal for beginners, as they are easier to use than casting rods.

, If you are traveling to fish, it may be wise to buy a fishing rod that breaks down into several pieces. If you have a boat or will be fishing nearby, you may only need to purchase a rod that remains in one piece. , In fishing, you are either using live bait, referred to as casting, or lures. A casting fisherman may want a more sensitive rod in order to be able to feel each small movement in the water. A lure fisherman may prefer a stiffer rod to be able to manipulate the rod and imitate the movement of the prey. Decide which technique you would like to use when choosing a rod.

Hold the rod in your hand.,
Check for defects.,
Check the guides.",How to Choose a Fishing Rod3," Comfort is an important factor when choosing a fishing rod and a rod may feel different in different people's hands. , Look for any cracks or poor workmanship in the rod. Defects may make it more likely for the rod to break in the future. If the rod breaks down into more than one piece, attach the pieces in the store and make sure they attach securely with no wiggle room.

, The guides are the loops that attach the line to the rod. They may be made of any kind of metal or ceramic. The more guides there are the better quality the rod, as the line is more controlled by the rod.


Hold the rod at eye level and look down the length of the rod from the tip to the butt to make sure the guides line up properly.

",How to Build a Fly Rod," Try building a 5 weight rod that is 9 feet (2.7 m) long.  Most rod blanks are four pieces, which is very convenient for storage. Here are a few key things to consider:


Type of fish
Location of fish
Size of fish
Size of fly;
, Many reputable fly shops sell rod building kits. This is highly recommended; fly shops are great sources of information. The kit will have all the pieces required to make a nice rod.

, Every fly rod has a spine. The spine is a thick section of the rod blank. Put some masking tape on the blank a couple inches from each end. To find the spine you roll the rod blank in your hands with a slight downward pressure and mark the the point you feel the blank rise up in your hands. Do this on all sections of the rod blank.

, This is done by gluing the reel seat to the base section of the fly rod blank with two-part epoxy.

, Make sure the handle is fully ""bedded"" in epoxy. This will eliminate squeaks between the blank and cork.

, The end cap is glued onto the bottom of the reel seat. Be careful not to get epoxy on the threads of the reel seat.


The rod is starting to take shape now. It's best to install the winding check at this time (before wrapping any of the guides). The wraps will permanently secure the winding check so use the epoxy sparingly when attaching. A mess would be bad.

, The tip top needs to align with the marks you made identifying the spine of the rod. Be sure to test fit the tip top first then mix some epoxy and glue it on.

, The guides should be smoothed before being wrapped.  The best way to smooth the guides is with sandpaper or a small file. Round all the edges so the finished product will be smooth. This is a quality of a good rod.

, Put all the rod sections together and line up the marks you earlier. Using a tape measure mark the guide positions starting at the tip top and measuring down to the handle. Mark the positions according to the guide chart supplied with the rod kit. Most 9 foot (2.7 m) rods have nine guides. Each guide needs to be within ¼"" of the specification in the guide chart.

, Cut masking tape into ¼"" wide pieces and tape the guides onto the rod. The largest guides are closest to the handle and the size reduces as you approach the tip top. With all the guides taped into position sight down the rod to be sure the guides are in alignment.

, Try to keep the wraps tight to each other and tie off the ends by wrapping them underneath the wraps.

, Wrapping at each of these locations adds strength to the rod.

, Look at each wrap and make sure it is tight, and all the guides line up. Slide or wiggle the guide if it doesn't quite line up. You want to make sure everything is perfectly straight and true.

, Only apply finish to three or four guides at a time. The finish will start to thicken and won't spread well if you finish more than four guides. Take you time and be patient.

, This way the finish won't sag. Keep turning for three hours. 


Some folks get a motorized finishing stand to do this.

Grab a worm and a hook.,
Stick the barbed end of the hook into the end of the worm so that it passes all the way through.,
Push the worm to the top of the hook.,
Grab the long end of the speared worm and push the hook through it again.,
Pull the worm down onto the hook.,
Cast away!",How to Bait a Hook with a Worm1," Before you go fishing, you should buy a container of worms or dig some up from your garden. Keep them in a small container full of cool dirt - Tupperware works well. Only bring your worms out when you're ready to use them. Make sure your hook is well-secured to your fishing line.


For tips and tricks on finding your own worms, see our How to Gather Earthworms guide. For help tying your hook to a fishing line, see How to Tie a Fishing Knot.
;
, Pick a spot about half a centimeter from one end of the worm. Too close to the worm's head, and he might be able to wiggle away from the hook. Take care not to hook your hand as the hook passes through the worm's body - don't press directly down onto the hook's point through the worm.


No need to be squeamish! Though the worm may squirm and thrash when you hook it, scientists believe that worms can't feel pain., Slide the worm up the hook in the same way you would slide a bracelet up your arm. Position the speared worm so that it's just below the hook's knot.


To further secure the worm, some fishermen tie the short end of the speared worm to the fishing line with a simple knot called a half hitch . To perform a half hitch knot, loop the fishing line around your worm, passing the line through the loop. Tighten to secure the worm to the line.

, Choose a spot a little further down the length of the worm - your best bet is to leave a little slack so that the ""loop"" of the worm's body between the two speared spots is slack enough to move a little. Repeat this step going down the length of the worm. When baited, the worm should have an accordion-like appearance.


The precise number of times you'll need to spear the worm varies based on its length. Generally 3-5 times is plenty.
Don't spear the very end of the worm. By leaving a little of the worm's length a little ""limp,"" you allow it to wiggle, which catches fish' attention better than a tightly speared worm.

, If your worm is bunched up near the hook's knot, move it down to the ""curve"" of the hook. You want the fish to bite the hook's barb - if the worm isn't anywhere near the barb, a fish might be able to get a free meal!

, Repeat this process as needed when you lose a worm or catch a fish. Practice makes perfect - it can be tough to spear squirmy, slimy worms at first, but within no time you'll be baiting worms like a pro angler. Happy fishing!

Imitate worms or lizards with Plastic/rubber lures.,
Employ proper technique.,
Fish based on the patterns of bass during the 4 seasons.,
Examine the water conditions.,
Keep the colors simple.",How to Choose Lures for Bass Fishing6," These lures are the most versatile and the most effective because they are so lifelike. They can also be fished weighted or weightless.Floating plastics can be used just like a topwater, and any type of plastic can be fished weedless to allow fishing in extremely heavy vegetation.

, Don’t reel the lure in, but rather retrieve it with purpose by lifting and dropping the rod as you take up the slack of the line. To fish a plastic/rubber lure, use the same technique as you would when using a jig. Cast out and give the line plenty of time to hit the bottom.


After the bait has hit the bottom and you have given it a twitch, slowly lift the rod tip until it points straight up in the 12 o'clock position. Let it sit there for a moment and then drop it down to the 9 - 10 o'clock position and reel in the slack. Repeat these steps until your line is in.
You'll have to have a good feel for your line to tell when a fish is biting so most people hold their finger against the line while lifting the rod tip.
Look for sudden resistance or bumping on the line, a line that goes slack suddenly or veers sideways. To set the hook, drop the rod tip very quickly to the 3 o'clock position, and pull back hard to 12 o'clock.
Use a floating plastic/rubber lure, around 7 inches, with a light wire hook using a split-shot rig or a Carolina rig.

, Fish with plastic/rubber lures in the Winter when bass are not very active. These lures can still be effective in warmer weather if you employ slightly more movement but the only time these lures are ineffective are when bass are very active.

, Plastic/rubber lures work best when water is over 55 degrees. Use large lures that are 7-10 inches when the water is murky but shorter lures that are 4-5 inches when the water is clear and the bass are lethargic.Both rigs and plastic/rubber lures are best used slowly.

, Choose from black, blue or purple when using plastic/rubber worms when fishing in murky water. Red hues may also work well when using plastic worms."

Refill a spinning reel.,
Tie the new line onto the reel.,
Hold the line between two fingers to keep it taut as you reel a couple of feet onto the reel.








,
Stop reeling and dip the rod toward the spool on the floor.,
Fill the reel only until it is about a quarter inch from the rim.

",How to Spool New Fishing Line Onto a Reel1," This is the kind that hangs down underneath the rod.


Make note of the direction your bale rotates. Depending on brand, some rotate clockwise, some, counterclockwise. Now, look at the new spool, and note the direction the new line unwraps from the spool.
For each reel, make sure your bale rotation and the spool unwinding match. In other words, if your bale rotates clockwise, make sure the line coming off the spool is coming off in a clockwise direction. This procedure will help minimize line twists.
If the spool unwind does not match the bale rotation, simply flip the spool over.;
, Lift the bail arm, and run the end of the new line up through the rod guides to the reel. Tie the line as follows:









Wrap the line around the reel.
With the free end, tie a basic overhand knot around the main line.
Tie a second overhand knot near the tip of the free end to prevent it from unraveling.
Tighten the knot around the reel, and closely trim the excess line from the end.
Note: if you're using very low diameter line and don't want the bulk of a knot, use electrical tape to secure the line to the reel.
Close the bail.

,, Confirm that the coil of line is being coiled onto the reel in the same way. If the line is okay, go ahead and finish. If not, go back and repeat the steps to make sure the coil of line coming off the spool of line is coiling onto the reel spool in the same direction.









For a spinning reel, a good way to spool the line is to take a soft cotton cloth and hold the line in the cloth at about the first eye. Apply a good amount of tension, so the line does not spool loose, and you can real as fast as you like.

,"
"
Choose the right line.,
Put the spool of line on the floor, label up.,
Hold the line between your fingers about a foot in front of the reel while you wind the handle to put line on the reel.,
Keep pressure on the line in front of the reel while you turn the reel handle to fill it.,
Keep the line taut.,
Use a swivel in front of the lure if you are using lures that typically cause twisting.,
Untwist the line.,
Set the drag.,
Feel your line near the lure for nicks and frays every once in a while when you are fishing.",How to Keep a Spinning Reel Line Trouble Free," Stiff line will loop off and be unruly, giving you nothing but trouble. Choose a line that says it is limp and can be cast, and stay within the pound-test guidelines on the reel itself. If the reel says it will hold 140 yards (128.0 m) of 4-pound-test, 120 yards (109.7 m) of 6-pound-test, and 100 yards (91.4 m) of 8-pound-test, don’t buy line over 8-pound-test. If you need stronger line than that, get a different reel.;
, Run the line through the guides on the rod to the reel with the bail open and tie it tightly to the spool. If you use a regular overhand square knot, pass the end through twice instead of just once – it will help keep the line tight on the spool. Close the bail.

, After a few seconds, lower the rod toward the spool of line. If the line kinks up and twists, turn the spool over so the label is toward the floor and start again. It’s normal for it to make big loops – what you’re watching for is twisting.

, Do NOT overfill the spool. Leave between an eighth and a quarter inch of the rim showing. Overfilling is a major cause of looping and problems with spinning reels.

, After you make a cast with a spinning reel, use your fingers in front of the reel to put tension on the line until the weight of the lure in the water puts a bit of tension on it. Reeling in loose line is a sure-fire way to get loops on your spool. Once the line is taut you can let go and reel normally.

, Plastic worms, inline spinners (Mepps, etc) and spoons often cause twist and will benefit from a swivel.

, If you do get some line twist, the line will twist up as you reel it in, causing loops all over the spool and making it difficult to cast. If this happens:


Take the lure off and simply let the line out behind the boat as you travel down the lake. Let as much line out as you can, and when you stop, wind it back on. Be sure to hold it taut while you wind it on.
Another solution is to tie the end of your line to something, then walk away while letting the line out. Pull on the line when you get enough off, to stretch the line slightly and remove kinks. Cut the end of the line free before re-winding it back onto the reel. Don’t stretch the line too much or you will weaken it. Just put a little pressure on it.

, The drag is the mechanism that allows line to spool off with the bail closed. This lets line off slowly if a big fish bites, so that it doesn’t break the line. To set the drag, leave the bail closed and pull on the line in front of the reel. It should take a fair amount of pressure to make the line come out. If you catch a small fish and it takes the drag out, tighten it. If a big fish starts to pull real hard and you think the line is going to break, loosen the drag. Simple as that. Some spinning reels have the drag knob in front and some are in back. Get familiar with your reel before you go out.


Stop reeling if you are fighting a fish and the drag is going out. Reeling while the drag is going out will twist your line, and it is futile anyway. Use your hand on the spool to get control over the fish, or tighten the drag if you need to.
The best way to set your drag is to use a scale and set it to 25% of the strength of the line. The scales are expensive, but some tackle shops have them. The pull and feel method works just fine for a fun-fisherman.

, If you feel any, cut off above the rough spots and re-tie.

Use jigs any time during the year.,
Use spoons for a number of different species.,
Use flies when fishing for trout.,
Choose lure colors according to weather and water conditions.,
Choose lure size according to the tackle you're using and the species you're fishing for.",How to Pick Freshwater Fishing Lures," Invented in 1949 by Nick and Cosma Crème and first marketed in 1951, plastic worms are probably the best-known largemouth bass lures. Available in a host of colors and lengths from 4 to 10 inches (10 to 25 cm), plastic worms have spawned a number of other soft plastic artificial lures: grubs, crayfish, and salamanders among them. Occasionally fished on the surface, plastic worms are most commonly fished in timber, brush, weeds, and along rocky drop-offs, and they are usually rigged by threading the hook through the worm so that its body covers the hook point and makes a self-weedless rig. (This rig is called a Texas rig when fished with a bullet-shaped slip sinker and a Carolina rig when fished with a leader, swivel, and egg-shaped slip sinker.);
, Also known as plugs, crankbaits are artificial lures made of hard plastic. They are so named because they are designed to be cast out and retrieved, with some versions intended to be retrieved rapidly to trigger fish to strike them aggressively. Although some are weedless, they are usually not intended to be fished around weeds, brush, or timber. Crankbaits come in several varieties, as described below:


Topwater lures are designed to be fished on the surface. These include poppers, which feature a vertical concave surface that makes a popping noise when jerked with the rod tip; wobblers, which feature plates that cause the lure to move from side to side when retrieved; and stick baits, which are thin lures without any special attachments that are given their action solely by the fisherman.
Thin minnow lures are shaped and usually colored like minnows. They feature a small lip at the front, differentiating them from stick baits; otherwise, they may be fished on the surface or underwater, usually with a twitching motion. Normark's Rapala is the best known lure of this type.
Swimming crankbaits, or swim baits, are artificial lures designed to move from side to side as they are pulled through the water. One style of this type of lure is curved with a flat or concave surface at the head, which functions similarly to the lip on a thin minnow in causing the lure to swim. The Lazy Ike and Helin Flatfish are 2 examples of this type of lure.
Diving lures feature a larger lip than thin minnows, enabling them to dive deeper when retrieved or trolled; the larger the lip, the deeper it dives. These lures may have either long, thin bodies, or short, stocky bodies. The faster the lure is retrieved, the deeper it will dive; if the retrieve is stopped, the lure, being hollow, will usually rise to the surface, although some crankbaits will remain suspended at the depth they reached.

, Sometimes called safety-pin spinners for their resemblance to an open safety pin, spinnerbaits feature a weighted end with a single hook and skirt and an end with 1 or more spinners. Spinnerbaits can be fished by being rapidly retrieved across the surface so that the blades flash and splash, bumped off standing timber, or let fall to the bottom around drop-offs and other vertical structures.


Spinnerbaits come equipped with either propeller- or teardrop-shaped blades. Teardrop-shaped blades are further divided into 3 types: the willow-leaf, which is narrow and pointed on both ends; the Indiana, which is a rounded-end version of the willow-leaf; and the Colorado, which is broad and rounded at 1 end and comes to a rounded point at the other.
Related to the spinner bait is the inline, or French, spinner, which features a tubular metal body with a willow-leaf or Indiana blade spinner ahead of it and a treble hook with a feather skirt behind it. French spinners are usually fished around rocky areas or in streams and attract trout, smallmouth bass, and walleye more than largemouth bass

, Jigs consist of a hook with a weighted head and either feature a hair or feather skirt or a plastic grub. Most jigs have round heads, but some jigs feature flat or triangular heads that either impart a swimming motion or keep the hook upright and out of rocks and weeds. Jigs are normally retrieved in an up-and-down motion and can be fished in warm or cold water situations, usually by slowing the retrieve as the water gets colder. Some jigs feature stiff brush or wire guards to keep them weedless, while most feature only a bare hook. Nonetheless, the best places to fish jigs are usually those places where they can get hung up, near weeds, brush, or rocks. (Jigs are the cheapest type of artificial lure, however, so the loss of a few jigs is usually not as consequential as the loss of a crank bait.)


Some jigs are rigged with removable safety-pin spinners, usually with a small grub body. The most familiar jig of this type is the Bass Buster Beetle Spin, a popular lure for a number of fish species.
Jigs may be fished in several ways. When fishing for bass, jigs are often flipped or pitched short distances instead of being cast long distances like most lures. They are usually retrieved with a lift-and-drop motion, slowly raising and lowering the rod so that the jig falls on a taut line. They may also be retrieved straight, with the rod kept at a 10 o'clock position to impart a swimming motion to the lure.

, One of the oldest lures, the spoon was developed in 1850 by Julio T. Buel of New York, supposedly by cutting the handle off a teaspoon and putting a hook on it. The resemblance to the bowl of a spoon causes spoons to wobble from side to side as they are retrieved, which is what draws fish to them. Smaller spoons have been used to fish for trout and panfish, while larger spoons have been used to fish for bass, pike, walleye, and other large fish.


Most spoons are designed to fish below the surface; these spoons feature a treble hook attached with a split ring. Two of the best-known spoons of this type are the Eppinger Dardevle, most familiar in its red-and-white striped pattern, and the Hofschneider Red-Eye, noted for 2 plastic eye-beads and hooks at the front and back. Thicker versions of these spoons may be cast or trolled, with the thickest designed to be fished like jigs, while the thinnest versions are designed exclusively for trolling.
Another type of spoon features a single wire-weedless hook whose shank is attached to the back of the spoon. This type of spoon is designed to be rapidly retrieved across the surface and is often dressed with a strip of pork rind or other bait attached to the hook.

, Flies consist of a single hook with either a hair or feather skirt. They are the smallest and lightest fishing lure and are usually used when stream fishing for trout, using special rods that cast weighted line with the fly attached with a monofilament leader. Flies are available in a number of patterns to match fly species trout feed on; many anglers tie their own flies, sometimes even at stream side to ""match the hatch."" Flies are available in 5 types, described below:


Dry flies float on the surface and are usually dressed with a waterproofing compound to keep them from waterlogging and sinking. They are attached to a floating line and fished in a way that matches the natural surface motion of the insect they are imitating.
Wet flies are designed to sink and to simulate swimming or drowning insects, as well as insects either laying eggs or hatching from them. They can be fished with floating, sinking, or sinking-tip lines, according to how deep you want to fish the fly. In calm water, you cast a wet fly beyond the fish's position and let it sink to the proper depth before retrieving it in as natural a fashion as you can. In moving water, you cast closer to and upstream from the fish and let the water move the fly to the fish.
Nymphs are a form of wet fly that simulates young insects or other small aquatic life. They are generally fished the same way as other wet flies.
Streamers may be fished the same way as either a dry or a wet fly. They are intended to simulate minnows or other small fish.
Bugs are dry flies designed to suggest large insects, amphibians, mice, or injured minnows. Some are designed with popper heads, like the topwater plug previously mentioned. They can be fished with either a floating or sinking-tip line.
Some fly fishermen fish multiple flies to determine which type of fly the fish are biting. It is possible to combine several fly types when doing this; however, you'll need to consult the fishing regulations for your state to determine how many hooks (lures) you can have attached to your line at once.

, The general rule for lure color is ""bright day, light colors; dark day, dark colors."" On bright, sunny days and in clear water conditions, choose lures that are light in color and mimic natural patterns. On cloudy days and in dirty water conditions, choose darker lures and those with a non-natural coloration, preferably types that make noise or vibrate as they move through the water.


A notable exception to this rule is the use of 2-toned plastic worms that feature a darker head color and a fluorescent pink or yellow tail color. Many anglers use plastic worms colored like this when fishing in cloudy water conditions.

, In general, choose smaller jigs and grubs when fishing for panfish (bluegill, sunfish, crappie, perch) and larger lures such as spinnerbaits and crankbaits when fishing for bigger fish (bass, walleye, and pike). Smaller lures are best suited for light and ultralight spinning and spincasting tackle (or fly rods in the case of dry and wet flies) with lines of 4 to 10-pound test (2 to 5 kg class), while larger lures are meant to be fished with medium to heavy action rods, spinning or baitcasting reels, and lines of 12 to 20-pound test (6 to 10 kg class) or better. (Lures used to fish for muskellunge, the largest member of the pike family, are decidedly larger than those used for bass, walleye, and northern pike, and often require the use of a wire leader because of the muskie's sharp teeth.)


Lure size can also be dictated by weather conditions and how fish react to them. In early spring, or when cold front conditions clear the skies and cool the water to make fish lethargic, smaller lures are usually better choices than larger lures. (Lures used for ice fishing are exceptionally tiny, usually grub jigs or small spoons.) In high-wind conditions, you may need to use a larger lure simply to have enough resistance on the end of the line to keep the wind from bowing it so that you can't detect if fish are hitting the lure. Also try casting out a spinner and just keep casting and retrieving the lure.

Pierce a worm with the hook just behind its head.,
Slowly and carefully push the hook through the worm's body lengthwise.,
When the worm's head is all the way up the length of the hook, stop.,
Cast!",How to Bait a Hook with a Worm2," Don't push the hook all the way through - the hook should be inside the worm's body but not coming the other side. This method of baiting is a little more difficult and increases the chance that a fish will take your worm without biting the hook, but it's much more attractive to fish. You'll go through more worms this way, but you'll also get more bites.

, Work the worm around the hook's curve like you'd push a sock up your leg. This step is difficult - be careful not to split the worm in half by pulling the hook's barb through the worm's body again.

, Pierce the point of the hook through the worm so that it's sticking out of its side. Allow the rest of the worm's body to dangle limply below the hook. Because so much of the worm is allowed to hang free of the hook, the worm's wiggling will be much more visible to fish in the water than in the standard method. It's also easier for fish to take the ""free"" portion of the worm without biting the hook. This method is high-risk, high reward.

, If you're using this method, make sure you have plenty of worms handy - you'll go through them quickly. If you can't seem to get the hang of it and keep splitting your worms in half, you can still use the torn segments of worm as bait by simply by spearing them on the hook just under the barb.

Put a pencil into the new spool and have somebody hold it—or use a reel filling station that you can buy at a tackle shop—to hold the spool of line.

,
Fill to within a quarter inch of the outer rim.",How to Spool New Fishing Line Onto a Reel2,", Keep a bit of pressure on the line so it doesn't get loopy and tangled.

"
Unscrew the face.,
Make note of the direction your bale rotates.,
Slide line through the front hole in the face.,
Screw the face back onto the reel before continuing.

,
Hold the line between two fingers to keep it taut as you reel a couple of feet onto the reel.

,
Stop reeling and dip the rod toward the spool on the floor.",How to Spool New Fishing Line Onto a Reel3," Before you can spool the line,you'll need to tie it onto the reel.

, Depending on brand, some rotate clockwise, some, counterclockwise. Now, look at the new spool, and note the direction the new line unwraps from the spool.


For each reel, make sure your bale rotation and the spool unwinding match. In other words, if your bale rotates clockwise, make sure the line coming off the spool is coming off in a clockwise direction. This procedure will help minimize line twists.
If the spool unwind does not match the bale rotation, simply flip the spool over.

, Then, attach the new line onto the reel. Lift the bail arm, and run the end of the new line up through the rod guides to the reel. Tie the line as follows:


Wrap the line around the reel.
With the free end, tie a basic overhand knot around the main line.
Tie a second overhand knot near the tip of the free end to prevent it from unraveling.
Tighten the knot around the reel, and closely trim the excess line from the end.
Note: if you're using very low diameter line and don't want the bulk of a knot, use electrical tape to secure the line to the reel.

,,, Confirm that the coil of line is being coiled onto the reel in the same way. If the line is okay, go ahead and finish. If not, go back and repeat the steps to make sure the coil of line coming off the spool of line is coiling onto the reel spool in the same direction.


A good way to spool the line is to take a soft cotton cloth and hold the line in the cloth at about the first eye. Apply a good amount of tension, so the line does not spool loose, and you can real as fast as you like.

Know what type of fish you are trying to catch.,
Be sure you are allowed to use your bait in your fishing area.,
Abide by the season when fishing in freshwater lakes and ponds.",How to Make Fish Bait Without Worms1," Every type of fish has their own feeding habits and prefered prey. Determining each will help you construct the perfect lure. Worms are usually effective for any type of freshwater fishing so creating a lure that has certain worm characteristics can be very beneficial., There maybe some fishing restrictions on bait or lures as warmwater lakes can prohibit the use or release of baitfish. It is always best to check local fishing regulations., During spring until fall, warm water goes from the top of the lake to the bottom. During summer the water is stagnant and from fall to spring, the cycle is reversed. Understanding this process and what temperature your fish prefer can help you choose the perfect bait.Warm water fish are usually surface feeders in high summer temperatures and bottom feeders in the fall. So choose baits accordingly.

To catch a wide variety of fish, use a small hook.,
Choose a name brand hook like Mustad or Eagle Claw, because their hooks are strong and proven.,
Use a short shank hook for its strength and a long shank hook for easy removal of the hook from the fish.,
Use the long shank hook for small fish or pan sized fish.,
Use the straight hook, also known as the standard hook, for a wide range of styles and fish.,
Use a circular hook for still bait fishing.,
Used the AH hook for its spaciousness in placing a bait on it.,
Use care when using treble hooks.,
Enjoy the outdoors and fish with top water plugs, because their treble hooks will not snag on the bottom.,
Depending on the type of fishing you do, choose the right eye.,
For trolling with artificial lures or bait, always use a sharp, medium shank, straight hook.",How to Choose a Hook for Saltwater Fishing," For example, a number five size hook can catch fish from a quarter pound to 25 pounds. However, angling and landing that number 25 fish, when using a small number five hook, requires careful angling and a gaff or a net at landing.;
, There are also dozens of other name brand hooks that work even better than Eagle Claw and Mustad. Ask your fellow fishermen what they use. Retailers often push what they either make the most profit from or they are trying to push overstocked items.

, The short shank hook, by design, is more durable and will not straighten out or break easily. In areas with many coral heads or a drop off, use a strong, short shank hook, heavier lines, and always keep the line taut with the fish on. Instead of forcing the landing of a fish in these conditions, an alternative is to let a big, strong fish tire itself in the deeper water and bring it in in the shallow, line breaking area, after it is no longer ""green"". An exhausted fish will show its sides which are light colored and not green.

, The longer shank prevents abrasion to the leader from the fish's mouth and makes hook removal easier. When fishing for small fish, you will be releasing small and undesirable fish, so the shank acts like a leader. When your leader gets weakened, cut it an inch above the eye and reattach it. The longer shank also prevents the fish from swallowing the hook, and helps keep the hook on the fish's lip or jaw.

, You must set the hook with a straight hook.

, Do not set the hook, this type of hook is self-setting. If you set the hook, when the fish is chomping on your bait, you will surely lose that fish. The hook will set when the fish turns and swims away. In this type of fishing, the angler puts a bell or alarm on the rod and does other things like: fishing for smaller fish, sleeping, barbecuing, partying, etc. With the rounded hook, the bait stays on the hook and the fish stays on the hook. The rounded hook is used for medium and large sized fish, because with pan sized fish the object is to catch a lot of fish. Fishing for pan sized fish is an active type of fishing

,

Set the hook, when a fish takes the bait with this type of hook. With an artificial bait, set the hook a bit quicker than a natural bait. With a hard artificial bait set the hook quicker than with a soft artificial bait.






When attaching an artificial bait or real bait to a hook, notice how it sits on the hook and what action is has when retrieved, trolled or just stationary. This hook is not as sturdy as other hooks but can hold baits well.
Use barbed shanks to thread plastic baits on the shank. However, threading the plastic bait on the hook curve, like in the illustration, works very well. As an option, slide on a piece of soft plastic chunk to the bottom of the hook's eye.







, These hooks can get caught on you or your buddies, on reefs, and on trees. These hooks are usually used on plugs and plugs are costly. Plugs that float have the least chance of getting caught of reefs and lost forever. Top-water plug fishing is very enjoyable because you can see the fish attack the lure.

, Most plugs have treble hooks attached, if big fish are tearing your hooks apart attach stronger single hooks in place of the treble hooks. When trolling expect bigger fish to take your plug, so replacing the treble hooks is a good idea.

, The eye is where you tie the leader to the hook.

The standard looped eye is good for all types of fishing.






The non-looped eye requires special snelling techniques for attaching the leader to the hook and is used for bait fishing usually.






With a hook that has no eye but a notch at the top of the shank, look and follow directions on how to snell hooks of this type. After tying a hook to a line, always test the strength of the knot. For example if your leader line is 20# test, test the knot at 8# of pressure. If you apply close to the breaking strength of a line when tying a knot, you could break the line at the knot. Testing a knot, tightens it and exposes any weakness, if necessary retie the knot.






Snell hooks, even if they have an eye, for bait fishing, so that the hooks are rigid with the line. A snelled hook is ideal for a multi-hook rig.







, The straight hook is the most common trolling hook, although for smaller big game double hooks are used. Treble hooks are never used for big game fishing. The hook tip must always be sharpened with a hook file. When trolling with artificial or live bait, for big game, the action is few and far between, thus the necessity for having sharp hooks.


The bill of a marlin and the areas close to it are hard, and it takes a sharp hook to get a hook-up versus a strike.






Hooks rust faster from trolling use compared to still fishing use, so be sure to always rinse and soak your lures and hooks.

Ask around.,
Research each recipe.,
Follow the directions.,
Be patient.,
Test it out!",How to Make Your Own Backpacking Food," Will you be only using it for backpacking or is your wife a master chef and she might want one later down the road. What you want to use it for will probably determine how much you're willing to spend.;
, Dehydrators can get very pricey so make sure you know ow much you want to spend. This depend on what you will be using it for. If your wife will be using every month and you will be using it once or twice a year then opt for an expensive one that costs around $150 to $200. On the cheaper ones the motors can burn out over a period of time. If you plan on using it once or twice a year then buy one that's between $50 and $100.

, You can always get a good deal somewhere. Look not only in stores but also online. Most department stores will sell them and if you plan on shopping online then look at massive retailers such as Amazon.

, The easiest place to find good recipes for dehydrated food is online. They sell some books in stores but typically they are extremely expensive.

, If you know a bunch of people that go hiking (i.e Boy Scout Troop or hiking club) ask them. Most veteran hikers dehydrate there own food and they would love to share recipes and give you some tips.

, Do not just use your own favorite normal dish and throw it in a dehydrator because certain foods dehydrate better than others. When looking at recipes use common sense.

, When making dehydrated food follow directions to the exact word. If you don't you risk messing up something that you just waited ten hours to finish.

, Most of the time when you are dehydrating food it will take up wards of five hours. You just have to wait because if you pull it out to early you can ruin the food or make the process even longer.

, Now that you have finished your first meal test it out. See how much water it takes to re hydrate because it will vary on the dehydrator you used. Make sure you like how it tastes so you don't get into the back-country and hate all of the food you brought with you.

Attach bits of bread, chicken, fish, corn, cheese, hot dogs, or raw bacon to your hook.,
Use cereal flakes.,
Make a lure using digestive biscuits and a smelly food.,
Use canned corn as bait.,
Fish with turkey livers.",How to Make Fish Bait Without Worms2," For catching catfish, use smelly foods in a cheesecloth or a sealed container with holes in it. (This is for when you are fishing in shallow waters without a fishing rod.) The only kind of food you need to be careful to not fish with is trout and salmon, as they can promote the spread of what’s called “whirling disease,” which is a type of parasite that can kill a lot of fish., Simply crush them, add water and make into little balls. Then you fit them around the hook. Wheaties work well (called Wheatie balls). You can also use red soda instead of water, as it attracts the fish more.

, The biscuits are usually sold in any shop or supermarket. Also pick up the smelly bait, for example, maggots or chicken liver. Crush the biscuits into crumbles. Put the crumbles in a bucket or bowl. Add the other baits.


Next, add a small amount of water to make a slushy kind of ball. Mix them all together. You now have a cheap homemade bait that's ideal for attracting fish.

, Because it works as well as live bait but without the mess, it’s a time-tested favorite among fishermen. Simply thread as many kernels that you get onto the hook. Throw your line out, and prepare to catch a small mouthed fish, like bream, as soon as it hits the water.

, Chicken livers are one of the most popular bait choices for new catfish anglers, but they tend to be a little more popular than they should be. They will catch some fish but the hassle of using them is often not worth the return. Turkey livers, on the other hand, catch more fish than chicken livers and are much tougher, so they are a lot less hassle to work with."

Attach small grasshoppers or crickets to your hook.,
Fish with grass shrimp, snails, leeches and other aquatic invertebrates.,
Entice catfish using shrimp.,
Bait with crawfish.",How to Make Fish Bait Without Worms3," Whether you catch them yourself or buy them at the bait shop, these are a safe bet to catch freshwater fish bream. To bait, hook them through the back. Then fish with the bait suspended a couple of feet below a bobber., These are great bait for walleye, sauger, panfish, sunfish and trout. It’s best to find them from the area where you are fishing because they are more likely to recognize and attack them., Most people buy “bait shrimp” from bait stores. But it’s better to purchase regular, whole shrimp at the grocery store and then cut them into small pieces. You’ll have a higher-quality bait that will catch more catfish, and, if you do the math, it ends up being cheaper., This makes terrific bait for all types of waterways and fish including bass, walleye, catfish and large trout. If they are dead, pinch the head off, and string the body on the hook by inserting it under the tail and impaling as much of it as possible. If they are alive, the crawfish can be hooked through the base of their tail from the bottom up."

Match the hatch.,
Entice fish with artificial lures.,
Try a variety of bait for bream.,
Use sponge bait and dip bait for catching catfish.",How to Make Fish Bait Without Worms4," Basically, what this phrase means is that you use bait that either the fish are already feeding on or that mimics what they are eating. Actually, regardless of the species, if you use this concept you will catch more fish. When it comes to catfish, they feed on all kinds of food, not just stinky bait as is commonly thought.Though it’s especially popular among trout-fishing enthusiasts, “Matching the hatch” is a phrase often used in the fishing world. The expression comes from the attempts from fly-fisherman to imitate the insects in any given area with artificial imitations to try and fool the fish. , Spoons, many jigs, tiny spinners and other small, life-like, plastic lures will work when fishing for bream or bass. Make sure the artificial lure mimics the movements of the fish’s natural prey. Form the lures around a hook at a size that accommodates their mouth.The components of a lure will dictate how it will move in the water. For example, a jerk bait has an oval shape and is meant to float and create jerking movements at the top of the water.

, Bream, also known as sunfish, panfish and brim, are not particular when it comes to feeding. They are also relatively easy to catch, no matter what the bait is. Whatever you choose, though, make sure it’s small enough to fit into the bream’s notoriously tiny mouth.If the bait is too big, they will just pull it off the hook little by little, until all that’s left is an empty hook.

, You can get them online by a variety of colorful names, at a bait shop or sporting goods store, or you can make them. All sponge and dip baits share a common factor and that is they stink. They are usually made with at least two extremely stinky and foul ingredients such as blood and guts of some form, like chicken livers or the innards of another kind of fish.Both are fished with using either a small dip or sponge tube to hold the bait. The disadvantage of this type of bait is that the tubes and sponges require additional expense as well as tackle.

Find a good stick.,
Trim it to length.,
Whittle off the bark.,
Let your stick dry.,
Add creative touches.,
Stain and seal the wood.,
Get a grip.,
Protect the base.",How to Make a Walking Stick," A good walking stick starts with a good piece of wood, of course. The size, shape, sturdiness, and age of the wood all contribute to the quality of a potential walking stick.


A good walking stick usually starts as a fairly straight piece of wood that is approximately one to two inches in diameter. Look for a piece of wood that is as tall as your armpit (usually in the 55-65 inch range); you can trim it to length later.Hardwoods tend to make the most manageable and sturdiest walking sticks. Good options include maple, alder, cherry, aspen, and sassafras, among others.Look for fresh hardwood, but never cut from a live tree to make a walking stick. Enjoy nature, don’t damage it. If you look around a bit, you will find a suitable stick that is still fresh but no longer living.Avoid sticks with holes or other evidence of insect activity. The stick may be weakened by insect boring, or you may unwittingly transport bugs into your home.;
, If you are making the walking stick for your own use, stand the stick on the ground and hold it in front of you as you would when walking, with your arm bent comfortably at the elbow (roughly at a right angle). Mark the stick about two inches above the top of your hand (or more if you intend to add a decorative top carving, for instance), and cut it to length with your saw of choice. (Note: Children or those unfamiliar with using saws should seek assistance. Power saws can take a finger in an instant, and hand saws can easily cause deep cuts as well.)If you want to size a stick for someone else before locating it, have him hold a broom out in front of him as described above. Measure the height from the floor to a few inches above the top of his hand. Take a tape measure or string cut to length with you on your walking stick search.If you are making walking sticks for sale or to give to undetermined recipients, remember that the 55-65 inch range is a good general starting point for stick length., You can leave the bark on if you wish, but most people prefer the look and feel of a stripped stick that reveals the smoothed wood grain beneath. Regardless, you’ll probably want to trim off any twigs or bumps by whittling them away.You can use a pocketknife, larger knife, or even a plane to whittle away the bark. Use the whittling tool that is most comfortable for you.
Shave away twigs and bumps first, then start shaving off the bark. Use short, quick, shallow strokes. You don’t want to dig into the wood. Good, safe whittling takes time.
Always whittle away from your body, with your legs clear of the shaving motion. A knot in the wood could cause the knife to jump and slice or puncture you. If you are unfamiliar with whittling, seek assistance from someone with experience.
Keep whittling until the bright wood beneath is exposed. Some trees have multiple layers of bark, so keep at it until you can see the wood grain.

, Fresh wood is better for trimming and whittling, but dried wood provides more rigidity and durability. Time and patience are your best friends in this process.


Drying time depends upon a host of factors, including wood type, environmental conditions, and personal preferences. Some recommend two weeks as the average target time, others say one month.Let the stick dry until it becomes rigid but not brittle. You may need to rotate its positioning, or even strap it into place (for instance, by pinning it against a flat piece of lumber with metal clips used to secure conduit or pipe in place) to keep it from warping.
Wood that dries too quickly can become brittle, so if it is extremely dry indoors, you may want to let your stick cure in a covered outdoor location, like a garage or shed.

, You may have seen walking sticks with intricately carved tops; the face of a long-haired, bearded man seems to be a popular choice. Depending upon your skill level with a pocketknife and/or other woodworking tools, you can try your hand at decorating the top of your stick. Remember, if you mess up, you can just trim the stick off a bit shorter!For somewhat simpler decorations, you can carve your name or initials into the stick. You can use a wood-burning tool to make these effects as well. Practice caution regardless of which method you employ.
Also, you may find practical value in carving grooves in the area of your hand grip. The undulating indentations found on many car steering wheels can serve as one type of inspiration, but a spiral groove that wraps around the stick can also make a comfortable grip., Once you’ve finished your trimming, whittling, curing, and carving, it is time to protect your creation so that it lasts for years to come. Sealing and especially staining the wood is optional, but recommended to improve the look and durability of your stick.Whether you are staining / sealing the stick or not, smooth it for comfort by using coarse and then fine sandpaper. Wipe away any sawdust with a tack cloth or a rag moistened with paint thinner.
Apply any wood stain according to the package instructions. Expect to let each coat of stain dry overnight, and to lightly sand and wipe clean between applications. The more coats you add, the darker the finish.
Add three coats (or the recommended number as per the package instructions) of a clear urethane varnish. Lightly sand with ultra-fine sandpaper and wipe clean between applications.
Do any staining or sealing in a well-ventilated area. Always wear gloves, and consider wearing safety glasses and breathing protection as well.

, If you have not carved a grip into your walking stick (see the step above on decorative carving), you can instead apply a grip after any staining and sealing is complete. Again, this step is optional.


Practical and visually-appealing hand grips can be made from strips of leather, twine, nylon, or braided rope, wrapped around the grip area and secured with pins or small nails.For that matter, an adhesive gripping wrap used for tennis rackets or golf clubs will also work, or even grip tape used on hockey sticks.
For an extra measure of assistance in keeping ahold of your walking stick, you can also add a wrist loop if desired. Drill a hole through the stick (ideally before staining or sealing), just above the grip area. Feed through a strip of leather or other preferred material and tie it into a loop that will fit comfortably over the wrist., The bottom tip of your walking stick will suffer the greatest wear and tear, which can result in cracking, splitting, splintering, or rotting. You can leave the tip in its natural state and clean, sand, or trim it as needed, or add optional protection to the bottom.


Rubber caps used for canes and walkers make an easy and affordable solution. Look for them anywhere medical supplies are sold. You can also use large rubber stoppers. Drill a hole in the stopper and the bottom of the stick so that each will accept a wooden dowel, and glue the connections in place.A short length of copper pipe can also make an elegant base protector for your walking stick. Take a one inch length of three-quarter inch or one inch diameter copper pipe, and whittle the base of your stick until the pipe just barely slides over the tip. Secure the pipe in place with a quick-drying epoxy glue."

Trains/Buses Schedules: Find the information by yourself!,
Accommodation: No camping when traveling alone!,
Talk to people!","How to Make the Most of a ""Backpacking Alone"" Experience in Europe"," Carry only what you need on a day to day basis.


Carry a smaller bag instead of a large backpack. Space may be limited on trains, airplanes, buses and ferries for your backpack. Very tall or heavy backpacks can cause serious back pain to the weary traveler. Limit your supplies to just a few necessity items






Things you shouldn't forget about:






1. A proper outfit for visiting churches & sweaters if you're going to take ferry/travel by night (no matter how hot the countries you're going to visit are supposed to be)






2. A towel, loads of socks and underwear (you will find wash machine in some hostels but you will probably have to wear the same clothes more than once).






3. Your phone, you bank phone number, a print of your documents, a camera, a fork & knives (even on places where there is a common kitchen).








Things you can go without: your laptop (there are some in almost all hostels, and if not you will always find a Cyber cafe), ipod & books (but it's just a matter of choice), food, hair straightener/heater (you may not be able to use them), fancy shoes (but you don't need real ""walking shoes"" either if you're staying in the cities, too much clothes. A lot of people hand wash their clothes while traveling, so if you're taking more than 5 t-shirts, you're already over-packing.





;
,


You may want to plan ahead or not,which cities you're going to visit, but in both cases you will need to have as much information as possible on your trains/ferry/bus. One thing you have to keep in mind is that all the clerks at train/bus stations don't speak English (almost none of them if you go in Eastern Europe). Another thing you have to know is that you can't rely on the scheduled time you are supposed to arrive to know where to hop off the trains (trains are often late!). So, before purchasing a ticket a the train station/going to catch your train, you would have to write down: 1.the train number ; 2. the accurate schedule 3.the stops before yours on the train route. You will find all this information by a very simple search on the route planner Webpage (http://hafas.bene-system.com/bin/query.exe/en?L=profi&).






Safety tip: You can go on night trains alone, but before hoping in the train, especially if you go in the Balkans/eastern Europe, try to find other young travelers to share a train compartment with, or some travelers who are stopping in your city's destination (even if you have buy a seat with a number, people usually don't care about it on those trains and it's a lot more safer!)









,


Well, you can do it technically, but you'd rather avoid it because you're quite unlikely to meet people there and it's no fun when traveling alone to be far from the city center (campsite usually are) if you want to go out at night etc..






Check your hostel before booking. Make sure that it has a washing machine & common kitchen if you need them, reviews about the hostels to know about the atmosphere (don't go to a party hostel if you're not into that), so that you will be much more likely to find cool people to talk/go out with.






Don't go to really cheap hostels: (unless you don't have any other choices) you may find yourself in a dorm with people who are not even travelers but homeless residents or people you wouldn't feel really comfortable with.






Safety tip: Remember something: it's not because the dorm was empty when you arrive that it will still be when you come back, so don't leave your bag without a locker or your money in display just because the dorm is empty!









, Last but not least, one of the best parts of backpacking alone is that the experience is a lot more ""intense"" than when traveling with people you know, and that you will get to talk with so many more people. You can easily talk to any solo traveler in their group.


Tip: One thing that is great to do when traveling solo is to only partially plan your trip (with your first destinations), and then decide on where to go next by asking the other travelers on their experiences/advices. When meeting fellow backpackers, they will almost always talk to you about a country/city you wouldn't have planned to visit!

Release the babies and mother together.,
Clean the area where the squirrel was trapped.",How to Trap a Squirrel With Everyday Materials," Look around the attic or the area where you've heard a squirrel scratching about and find out where it came in. If you find more than one hole, plug all but the main one, so that the squirrel has only one way to enter and exit. You'll set up the trap at this entry point.


Block the entry points by securing pieces of hardware cloth around the holes using a staple gun.






It's best to do this in mid-morning, when the squirrel will probably be outside finding food.
If you can wait until the high heat of mid-summer to squirrel-proof your attic, you may not even have to set up a trap. Attics get too hot for squirrels at this time of year, so you can block all the entry points, including the main one, while the squirrels are away.;
, Before you trap and release the squirrel, it's important to find out if there are babies in the picture. Mother squirrels commonly take shelter in attics when they're about to give birth, and chances are high that there's a nest somewhere in your walls or rafters. A typical squirrel nest will have 3-5 babies. If you trap the mother squirrel without handling the babies first, they'll die. Aside from being inhumane, leaving the babies to die will create a bad smell in your home.


If you've looked everywhere for the pup ""squirrel"" and you can't find them, feel carefully along the walls. When you come to a spot that feels much warmer than the rest of the wall, that's probably the nest. You're going to have to cut a hole there to remove the babies, then patch up the wall later. This takes some trouble, but it's a lot better than letting them die in the walls.






If you find babies, determine whether they are old enough to leave the nest and survive on their own. If they are still too young to walk, wait a few weeks before trapping the mother. Otherwise, the babies will starve in the nest.

, Start by securing a piece of hardware cloth to the inside wall of the main entry point, leaving a hole just large enough at the bottom for a squirrel to climb through. Bend the bottom of the hardware cloth toward the outside so that it forms a tube-like shape. Bend the prongs on the cloth slightly inward. A squirrel can squeeze through this hole to get outside, but won't be able to get back in.If you find that the squirrel can still get in and out of the house, you may need to make the hole smaller. You should also check around to make sure that you've covered the other entry points.
If you found baby squirrels, remember that you shouldn't set up the door before they're big enough to leave the area on their own. Otherwise, you'll have a nest of babies on your hands while the mother is trapped outside., Trapping squirrels is illegal in many states, and in some cases it's only legal if you kill them directly afterward. If you want to set up a trap, you can place a wire cage on the outside of the one-way door so that the door empties directly into it. When the squirrel exits, it will jump into the cage, and won't be able to get back out.


To lure the squirrel into the cage, you can bait the trap with peanut butter or oranges.
Wire cages are common household items, but they aren't the ideal traps for squirrels. A better bet is to buy a one or two-door squirrel trap.These are designed specifically to trap squirrels humanely.

, The tricky part will be closing the cage door without letting the squirrel loose.

, There shouldn't be a need to touch the squirrel, but if you end up doing so, make sure you wear heavy-duty gloves. Squirrels may nip and scratch, and it's important to protect yourself.

, If you release the squirrel too close to your property, it will climb right back into the attic. Drive well away from your neighborhood and release the squirrel in an area with plenty of trees.

, If you somehow trapped both the babies and mother, try to release them all in the same place. The babies will have a much better shot at surviving if they're released with their mother., After you've released the squirrel, sanitize the area where you found it using heavy-duty cleaning products. Make sure all of the entry holes are secured. Consider spraying squirrel repellant in the area on the off chance that the squirrel will try to come back.

However, depending on your state, the rules regarding beaver trapping may range from virtually nonexistent to somewhat limiting. In some states where beaver populations are high and trapping demands are low, like Georgia, beaver season lasts year-round.In other states, like North Carolina, there are designated seasons for beaver trapping.Before buying a trap or planning a trapping expedition, it's wise to double-check trapping laws in your area.


Note that, in states that have a season for beaver trapping, the season usually extends from about November or December to, at latest, about March or April. Beaver pelts are at their best during the winter months.;
, Though the North American beaver is native to Canada, it can now be found across the continent, from isolated pockets in northern Mexico to all but the coldest, northernmost reaches of the Canadian wilderness.Beavers are aquatic mammals, so they are are typically found in and around lakes, streams, and rivers. They often build dams and dwellings called lodges in these bodies of water, and are quick, industrious builders, using mud, branches, and, famously, trees in their structures. Because beavers rely on the presence of water and suitable foliage to build their dwellings, this means that in arid or desert environments, like the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico, beavers are not found. They are also not found on the Florida peninsula.Additionally, though beaver were nearly hunted to extinction in Europe, they can now be found in Poland, Czechoslovakia, and several other Eastern European countries.

, Beavers' practice of building lodges and dams naturally leads to several telltale signs of their presence. One is, obviously, the structures themselves, which are often relatively easy to spot. From the outside, lodges resemble large piles of branches, mud, and foliage located in and around rivers, streams, lakes, and the like. Dams can be composed of felled trees as well, and, like an artificial dam, produce a buildup of water on one side and cause water to rush around the sides or through any holes.


Another sign of beaver presence is felled trees. Trees that have been felled by beaver leave stumps with a cone-like point, rather than the flat cross-section a chainsaw would leave or the sideways jagged cut from an axe.
If you spot a beaver lodge or dam, look for a well-worn beaver path. Beavers can repeatedly take the exact same route to and from their structures, leaving a defined trail on the structure itself or in the surrounding area. These paths are an ideal spot to lay your trap.

, The ideal place to set a body grip is in an area you know the beaver will pass through. You'll probably want to set your trap at the entrance to a beaver lodge, in a narrow, shallow canal near a dam or lodge, or along a well-defined beaver path. Alternatively, you may want to set your trap so that the beaver must pass through it to reach bait (usually castor scent) that you've set.

, When set, bodygrip traps (often referred to by the brand name ""Conibear"") create a vertically-standing square ""portal"". When a beaver walks through this space, the edges of the spring swing down, trapping the beaver by its neck and (ideally) killing it instantly.To begin setting this type of trap, first lay it on the ground in the area where you'd like to set the trap. Don't set the trap and then try to carry it to its final location. These traps can be triggered by delicate motion and can cause injury to humans.


When you lay the trap down, look for two springs - one on each side of the central ""square"". If the two wing-like springs are pointing to the inside of the trap, turn the springs to the outside of the trap so that the rounded end of each points away from the central ""square"" jaws.

, Though it's possible to set a bodygrip trap with just your hands, it's advisable to use a pair of special metal sticks called ""setting tongs"" or ""setting tools.""These long metal tools allow you to set the trap while keeping your hands and fingers free, so as to avoid the risk of injury. Whether or not you use these setting tongs, take one spring and compress it, aligning the spring over the trap's central joint.


When the spring is compressed, set the safety catch. This is usually a small hook attached to the spring itself, which keeps the spring compressed while you complete the rest of the steps necessary to set the trap.
Warning - once one spring is compressed, you should consider the trap ""live"", as its jaws can now snap together with force if it's sprung. Whether you're using setting tongs or not, use caution when handling the trap from this point forward.

, Though some only use one spring, most common body grip traps employ two springs to give the jaws added power. If your trap has two springs, compress the second spring as you did the first and latch it shut with the safety hook. When both springs are compressed, carefully align them over the trap's central joints.

, Body grip traps are set vertically to allow beavers to walk through them and spring the trap. Very carefully stand your trap up so that two parts of the trap called the ""dog"" and ""trigger"" are on the top edge of the trap.


The dog is a toothed or notched piece that secures the trap's jaws together when it's set. Essentially, it holds the trap open until it's sprung.
The trigger is a thin, whisker-like piece that's used to spring the trap. The whisker hangs down between the jaws. When a beaver walks through the trap, it pushes on the trigger, releasing the dog and causing the jaws to swing shut.

, Carefully compress the trap jaws. Set the trigger in the desired notch of the dog, then insert the trap's forward jaw in this notch. Carefully cease compressing the jaws - the dog should delicately hold the trap open.

, Ever-so-carefully remove each spring's safety hook and slide them towards the coiled end of the springs. Your trap is now set and should be considered dangerous. Don't move or handle it without carefully resetting the safety hooks, and even then, only do so if necessary.

, Most body grip traps can be set independent of any external supports, but, to keep your trap secure, you may want to use such supports anyway. Secure a trap by the circular, coiled ends of its springs - never by the square jaws. Either loop wire through each coil and tie the wire to a nearby object or drive a thin, sturdy stake through each coil. In either case, do so before setting your trap to minimize the chance of injury.

, Foothold traps require an animal to step on them - when it does, the jaws of the trap swing shut, trapping the animal's foot or leg in the trap. Because this doesn't kill the animal immediately, with beavers, it's important to only set such traps underwater so that the animal drowns when trapped. If set on land, the beaver may endure prolonged suffering and may even be killed by a coyote or other small predator from which it can't escape.


Set a foothold trap in the shallow water at the edge of a lake or stream at a spot where a beaver path meets the water (called a ""slide""). Though it should be in shallow water so that the beaver steps on the trap rather than swims over it, the water must be deep enough to drown the animal - usually about 8–10 inches (20.3–25.4 cm) of water will do.
Additionally, because you want the beaver to trigger the trap by stepping on it, set your trap off-center (about 6 inches) in the slide. If you set it in the center, the beaver may simply walk over the trap without stepping on it.

, Foothold traps usually have a short length of chain attached. This is so that they can be attached to the ground or a nearby object - if they aren't, the trapped, scared, possibly wounded animal may flee, taking your trap with it.


For beaver, use a stake to drive the chain into the earth as far away from the trap itself as the length of the chain will allow. Stake the chain in the water, not on land. Use a deep, strong, sturdy stake.You don't want to give the beaver any slack in the chain that will allow it to move towards land once the trap is sprung. Bad stake placement can allow the beaver to reach a spot where it can breathe once the trap is sprung, prolonging its suffering.

, Foothold traps come in a wide variety of styles, but most have powerful springs attached to levers that run parallel to the trap's jaws. Use the levers to compress these springs and open the jaws. Be very careful not to allow your hands to slip or to let any fingers go between the jaws.


For some models of foothold trap, you may find it easier and safer to set the trap on the ground, compress the springs by stepping on them, and then bend over and do the rest of the steps, keeping the springs compressed with your feet.

, Keep constant pressure on the trap so that it doesn't snap shut and catch a hand or finger. Carefully open the jaws and swing the dog up, catching the jaw in its notch. Like with a bodygrip trap, the dog holds the jaws open, releasing when the animal springs the trap.

, A foothold trap's ""pan"" is the circular part of the trap in between the jaws. The animal springs the trap by stepping on the pan. Use your thumb to hold the dog and jaw together. Then, raise the pan into position by reaching under the loose jaw with your fingers and gently lifting the pan up. Don't reach down through the trap or reach over either jaw. If you do this, you run the risk of injury, should you slip. Your trap is now set - handle it with extreme care.


Ideally, your pan should sit level in the trap, not slanted up. If you need to make an adjustment to the pan, be sure to work under the loose jaw of the trap. Never, ever reach between the jaws to make an adjustment.
Note also that some types of foothold traps allow you to adjust the tension in the pan so that it only triggers under a certain amount of weight. For beaver, 4-5 pounds is ideal, as this keeps the trap sensitive while allowing you to avoid smaller animals.

, When setting a live trap, it's important to choose a location for the trap where the animal will be in a minimum of danger for the time that it's stuck in the trap. With beavers, it's important to not put live traps in water deep enough to cause the animal to drown. Instead, put them above water or at the very edge of a lake or stream, where water is only an inch or so deep. Secure your trap well so that it can't fall into deeper water. It's also wise not to use live traps in areas exposed to extremely cold or hot weather to avoid the risk that the trapped animal may be injured or die due to exposure.


Note that live traps come in several varieties. Many of the most common are metal, box-like traps with doors at either end, but other types of live traps, including traps that resemble suitcases, are used. The steps in this section refer to the common box variety.

, Box traps usually feature locking doors at either end. To open either door, often, you'll need to push two locking bars towards the interior of the cage to release the lock holding the door closed. Then, keeping one arm on top of the box to hold it steady, raise the door until it rests roughly horizontally.

, Unlike the other traps in this article, which trap and kill the animal when it unwittingly springs it, live traps depend upon the animal willingly wandering into the trap. Because of this, bait can be crucial for a successful trapping effort. For beavers, bait is usually in the form of a liquid scent. Soak a small rag in this scent and hang it inside the trap over the trip pan. When the beaver goes to investigate the scent, it will step on the pan and spring the trap, lowering the door(s) and trapping itself inside.


In terms of baits, many trappers use castor scent, a commercially-available fluid naturally produced by beavers to mark their territory.

, Like the other types of traps discussed in this article, most live traps have a dog piece that holds the trap's door open and releases it when the trap is sprung. When you've raised the door to its highest position, secure the dog on the corresponding notch on the door - here, individual traps' mechanisms will vary - and carefully release it. If done correctly, the door should remain open, held in place by the dog.

, Most box-type live traps have one door at either end of the trap. You may want to open both doors to allow a beaver to enter the trap from either end. However, depending on where you've chosen to place your trap, this may not be necessary. For instance, if you place the trap at the edge of a lake or stream, you're probably only expecting beavers to approach it from the direction of the water, so the second door isn't needed.

, Whether you use a killing trap or a live trap, it's important to come back and check it every day. With a live trap, the reason for this is obvious - the beaver is stuck inside the trap and may suffer or go hungry if it's kept inside for a long period of time. However, you'll want to frequently check your killing traps as well, especially if you're interested in the beaver's pelt. The longer the beaver is left dead in the trap, the greater the effects of decomposition and the greater the chance its body will be eaten by scavengers.


Additionally, on the off chance that a killing trap does not instantly kill its intended target, you'll want to be able to release the animal or put it out of its misery as soon as you can.

, Avoid using any sort of trap in areas that are known to be frequented by pets, especially dogs. Smaller dogs can be roughly beaver-sized and thus can be maimed or killed by beaver traps. Don't even use live traps in areas where pets roam, as, if you accidentally catch a pet, it will be your responsibility to find and notify the owner, who may be under the assumption that their pet has run away.


In rural areas, people sometimes let their dogs wander within a few miles of their home. Be very conservative when setting your traps - most cautious trappers won't use traps within several miles of any residence.

, Otters often live in the same types of habitats as beavers - lakes and streams in wooded areas. Otters can easily spring bodygrip traps intended for beavers, so, if you're using a bodygrip trap, consider the possibility that this will happen and accommodate by sliding the trigger so that it hangs along one side of the ""square"", rather than in its center. Otters are slimmer than beavers, so, by doing this, you increase the chance that otters will pass harmlessly through the trap while not hampering your ability to catch beaver significantly.


Obviously, don't attempt to do this when the trap is armed. Instead, do it as you're arming the trap.

, Though some states have open season on beavers year-round, this doesn't mean there aren't any rules regulating trapping activity. Most jurisdictions will have rules regarding the types of traps that can be used, the locations where trapping is allowed, the sorts of things you can use trapped beaver for, and more. If you're in doubt, double-check with local officials before attempting to trap beaver. The relatively small amount of time it takes to check your local hunting authority's website is well worth the money you'll avoid in the form of fines if you break the law.


One common law in virtually all jurisdictions is that you may not trap beavers (or, for that matter, any animal) on someone else's private property without their express permission.

Flesh the hide.,
Wash the hide.,
Dry the hide.,
De-hair the hide.,
Brain the hide.,
Soften the hide.,
Smoke the hide.",How to Tan a Hide1," Fleshing the hide is the process of scraping off the flesh and fat, which prevents the hide from rotting. Place the hide on a fleshing beam (a beam designed to hold the hide in place as you work) or on a tarp on the ground. Use a fleshing blade to scrape off all visible traces of flesh and fat using quick, strong strokes.


Flesh the hide immediately after cutting the hide from the animal's body. If you wait more than a few hours, the hide will begin to decompose, and it will fall apart during the tanning process.
Be careful not to damage the hide as you scrape. Don't use a knife not intended to be used for fleshing, since it might puncture or scratch the hide.;
, Use clean water and soap made from natural substances to wash away dirt, blood, and other impurities before you begin softening the skin.

, Let it dry out for a few days to prepare it for the tanning process. Bore holes along the edge of the hide and use twine to attach it to a drying rack. These wooden racks, which can be purchased at game shops, hold the hide in place as it thoroughly dries.


Make sure that the hide is actually stretched, not just hung, on the drying rack. The more the hide is stretched, the larger it will be once the tanning process is complete.
If you stretch your hide over a wall or barn, make sure there's ample space for air to circulate between the hide and the wall, or it won't dry properly.
The drying process can take up to a week, depending on your climate.

, Take the hide off of the dryer and use a rounded steel blade with a handle or an elk antler hide scraper to remove the hair from the hide. This ensures that the tanning solution can thoroughly soak the skin. Carefully scrape the hair and the epidermis from the hide.


If the hair is long, cut it first. Scrape against the grain of the hair, and scrape away from yourself.
Be careful near the belly area, since the skin there is thinner than the skin on the rest of the hide.

, The oils in an animal's brain provide a natural tanning method, and each animal has a brain just big enough to tan its entire hide. Cook the animal's brain and a cup of water until the brain breaks down and the mixture resembles soup. Place it in a blender so it is completely smooth. Take the following steps to apply the brain to the hide:


Wash the hide with water. This removes any remaining grease and debris and makes the hide more malleable, so it will be better able to absorb brain oils.
Wring the hide out, so it will be able to take in the oils. Squeeze out the excess water by placing the hide between two towels and squeezing, then repeating the process with two dry towels.
Rub the brain mixture into the hide. Make sure you cover every inch of the hide.
Roll up the hide and store it in a large plastic freezer bag or food storage bag. Put it in the refrigerator to let the brains soak in for at least 24 hours.

, Now that the oils have soaked into the hide, it's ready for softening. Take the hide out of the refrigerator and place it back on the drying rack. Wipe off as much of the brain mixture as possible. Use a heavy stick or a hide breaker to soften the hide by running the tool back and forth across it.


You can also have a partner help you stretch and soften it by taking it off the drying rack and pulling on the edges from either side. Continue doing so until you are both tired, then place it back on the rack and use the hide breaker to keep working the hide.
A heavy rope can also be used to soften the hide. Have a partner hold one side of the rope and work together to rub it back and forth against the hide.

, When the skin is soft, pliable, and dry it is ready to be smoked. Stitch up any holes in the hide, then sew it up the sides of the hide to make a bag. Close one end so it is tight enough to hold the smoke. Invert the skin bag over a hole about a foot across and half that deep. Use sticks to make a rough frame to hold the skin bag open, and tie the closed end to a tree or use another long stick to keep it held up. Build a small, smoky fire inside the bag to smoke the skin.


Once the little fire has a coal bed built up, start adding smoke chips to it and peg the skin around the hole. A little channel tunneled out to one side will allow you to keep the fire supplied.
After smoking the first side for half an hour, turn the bag inside out and smoke the other side.

The edges of your cover will end up bunching, which means as long as the rounded corners are roughly the same, irregularities won't be noticed., Fold one long edge of your sheet so it lines up evenly with the sheet's middle. Fold the opposite edge in the same way to form two inward facing flaps.


Both flaps should be evenly aligned with the middle of the sheet, lengthwise, before moving on., Open one of the long flaps. At one end of the seam and moving in the direction of the opposite end, apply 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) of glue along the seam. Do the same at the opposite end of the flap, then close the flap. Repeat this process with the other flap.


At this point, you should wait for your glue to dry before moving on. For most quick drying glues, you should be ready to move in as few as 15 minutes., Open your flap gently, being mindful not to pull on the glue too much. Fold the space between the glued seam and the middle of the sheet so the new fold and flap both align with the sheet middle.


When finished folding the first flap, repeat this process with the other one. When finished with both, the inward facing seam should be beneath the flap, with both the seam and flap edge aligned evenly with the sheet middle.

, Similar to your flap glue application, you'll be gluing your second fold. Open your unglued fold. Starting from one end of your seam and moving toward its opposite end, apply 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) of glue. Repeat this for the opposite end of the seam.


The remaining unglued fold should also be glued in this fashion. When finished, you should allow the glue to harden to promote a solid bond., Open your sheet completely. It should bunch where you have glued seams together. Once your sheet is open, fold each outer perimeter of the sheet inward 1 inch (2.5 cm) for all edges. Then:


Use a durable tape to fasten the edges that have been folded inward to the plastic sheet. Leave about ½ inch (1.3 cm) of space between your tape and the newly formed fold that is now the outer edge.
The loop of sheet formed by folding the perimeter of the sheet inward is where you will string your elastic cord., This can take some patience. Feed your cord into the channel of the seam until you pull it through one entire edge. Then, tie off the opposite end of your string in a large knot to prevent it pulling through while stringing the rest of the cover.


Continue stringing your elastic cord through the gap created by the loop around the perimeter of the plastic sheet edges until you have returned to your starting point.
It can be difficult to force the cord through the plastic loop. In some cases, you can grip the cord through the plastic and pull it/inchworm it along., Looser elastic may be easier to put on or take off, but it will also be easier for it to be blown off by wind or fall off in transit. Keep this and the approximate size of your backpack in mind when tightening your cord. To tighten your cord:


Pull on the end of the cord that you have fed through the perimeter loops of your cover. When the elastic is sufficiently taut, stop pulling.
Refrain from tightening your cord too much. Putting too much strain on the elastic can strain it and compromise its elasticity., Keep the free end of your cord firmly in hand to preserve the cord's tautness. Untie the knotted end, keeping a tight grip on it also to maintain tension in the cord. Then, use a simple knot to connect the ends together.

, It's likely you'll have some extra elastic at the ends of your cord. Cut this free with your scissors to finish your bag. If your cover is for a child, you may want to consider labeling it so it doesn't get lost., If there's a sudden downpour and you don't have your cover on hand, you can tear arm and head holes in a garbage bag to create a makeshift poncho. Most garbage bags should be large enough to fit both you and your backpack, keeping you both dry.


Avoid tearing arm and head holes that are too large in your garbage bag. This will create more opportunities for leakage and dripping.

, For this technique, you should prioritize umbrellas with a wrist strap. Take the wrist strap and tie it firmly to the handle at the top of your backpack so the umbrella hangs over the front of your head and your bag as well, keeping you both dry.


You may be able to use a length of cord, an article of clothing (like a scarf), and so on to tie umbrellas without wrist straps to your backpack.
Be sure to tie your umbrella firmly and securely to your backpack. Otherwise, your umbrella may be blown away.
Avoid using this technique in particularly bad weather. Updrafts from sudden gusts of wind could cause your umbrella to jostle painfully against your head.

, Choose a raincoat or waterproof jacket that's larger than your normal size. You'll want it to be large enough to accommodate your backpack as well. Put on your backpack, then suit up in your raincoat or waterproof jacket to protect your bag from the rain.


This may look silly, as though you have a hump, but it is very effective for keeping your bag dry.

, Take a plastic sheet, garbage bag, or some other similar, waterproof material, and tuck it between your back and backpack. Pull the material so that part of it is pinned between your back and the bag, but the rest of the material is draped over the back of the bag to protect it.


A plastic garbage bag is a great on-the-go cover. You can fold one of these to a very small size and stow it in your bag for rainy day use.
To keep your makeshift bag cover in place, you might want to use some waterproof or water resistant tape, like duct tape, to hold the cover to your bag.

Research the different breeds of water dogs.,
Pick out a puppy.,
Introduce the puppy to water when they are little.,
Teach your dog to sit and stay.,
Introduce your dog to decoys and to the scent of waterfowl.,
Practice daily, if possible.,
Reinforce positive behavior with positive rewards.,
Expose your dog to actual hunting situations before taking it out into the field.,
Use training dummies early and often.,
Train your dog in a boat prior to a hunt if boats are going to be used.,
Simplify the training by keeping it simple.",How to Train Your Dog to Hunt," There are many dogs suitable for hunting waterfowl. Some of the most popular are Labrador Retrievers,Golden Retrievers and Springer Spaniels. Look into the different breeds and decide which one is best for you and your hunting adventures. You should also be mindful of the amount of care a particular breed will need. Some dogs require a lot of room to run, for example, while others are more sedentary. Choose a dog that you can provide a good home for.;
, Although there are many adult dogs that are trained to hunt waterfowl, it is generally best to train your own puppy. Not only will a puppy allow you the time to train the dog for your hunting style, starting with a puppy will also ensure a loyal dog that is bonded and conditioned to its owner. Make sure you use a reputable breeder; you can research breeders online or at your local dog or hunting clubs. Animal shelters and animal controls often have lab and retriever mix puppies that are in danger of being put to sleep. Many mixes can be trained to retrieve ducks if proper time is spent training them. Ask a shelter if you can foster retriever mix puppies and find one that has a natural instinct to retrieve and likes water! Many times if dogs do not have a natural instinct you can help find them a home and work with a different puppy!

, Instill the idea that water is good, water is fun, and playing in water is a way to earn rewards and other positive reinforcement. You can start in a small wading pool at first, and in no time your dog will be ready for the open water.

, Although these are basic and cliché dog commands, they serve as the foundational commands for more complex hunting demands. Use food as a way to teach sitting. Hold food over the dog’s head. Give the command to sit while simultaneously pressing gently on the dog’s hind legs. As soon as the dog sits give it a treat. Repeat this over and over. Soon your dog will sit at the first glance of a treat. Eventually, he or she will sit without requiring a treat.

, It is important that your dog quickly understand the difference between a real duck and a decoy. You can utilize waterfowl scent and dummies to train your dog. Be sure to set decoys far away from the dog before throwing the dummy so they are able to find out where the dummy is and knows the difference between a real bird and a decoy.

, Make waterfowl training a fun, rewarding experience for your dog.

, When you attach a scent to a decoy or training device, throw it in the water, and see your dog fetch the trainer and return it to you, make sure to let your dog know what a good job it has done. There is nothing a dog wants more than to please its owner, and to establish a lifelong hunting partnership it is important to let your dog know from a young age that retrieving game is something he or she will be rewarded for.

, A dog that is trained only in theory may not perform to expectations in the field. A dog that is expected to perform around guns needs to be trained in the presence of guns. Take your waterfowl dog with you when you target practice, or set up simulated hunts in a proper shooting area. The key point is that your dog has to be prepared for actual situations if you expect it to perform like a seasoned hunter. Condition your dog prior to the hunt. You want your dog at peak performance in the field.

, The more you train your dog to the scent and feel of waterfowl, the more your dog will impress you in the field. Remember, a dog’s biggest pleasure is pleasing its owner, so if you show appreciation for good behavior in practice your dog will certainly please you in hunting situations.

, Load it in and out, and practice retrieving dummies from the boat.

, Your basic goal is to get your dog to retrieve the bird. In your training program focus on rewarding your dog for retrieving the training dummy. It is in the natural instincts of a retriever to want to go after, retrieve, and return a shot bird. It is the job of the owner to get the dog trained to consistently and methodically do so.

Flesh the hide.,
Salt the hide.,
Gather tanning equipment.,
Tan the hide.,
Wash the hide.,
Drain and oil the hide.,
Stretch the hide.",How to Tan a Hide2," Fleshing the hide is the process of scraping off the flesh and fat, which prevents the hide from rotting. Place the hide on a fleshing beam (a beam designed to hold the hide in place as you work) or on a tarp on the ground. Use a fleshing blade to scrape off all visible traces of flesh and fat using quick, strong strokes.


Flesh the hide immediately after cutting the hide from the animal's body. If you wait more than a few hours, the hide will begin to decompose, and it will fall apart during the tanning process.
Be careful not to damage the hide as you scrape. Don't use a knife not intended to be used for fleshing, since it might puncture or scratch the hide.

, After fleshing, immediately lay the hide in the shade on a tarp and cover it with three to five pounds of salt. Make sure it is completely coated.


Over the course of a couple of weeks, continue salting the hide until it has become crispy.
If you see a pool of liquid emerge from an area of the hide, cover it with more salt.

, Tanning solution is made from a combination of household ingredients and chemicals you'll need to source elsewhere.Gather the following ingredients:


2 gallons (7.6 L) water
1 1/2 gallons (7.6 L) bran flake water (Make this by boiling 1 1/2 gallons of water and pouring it over a pound of bran flakes. Let the mixture sit for one hour, then strain and reserve the water.)
8 cups salt (not iodized)
1 1/4 cups battery acid
1 box baking soda
2 large trash cans
1 large stick, for stirring and moving hides

, Begin by soaking the hide in clean water until it is soft and pliable, so it will absorb the tanning chemicals more easily. When the hide is ready to tan, peel off its dried inner skin. Then take the following steps to tan the hide:


Put the salt in a trash can and pour 2 gallons (7.6 L) of boiling water inside. Add the bran flake water and stir until the salt has completely dissolved.
Add the battery acid. Make sure you wear gloves and take other precautions to prevent getting burned.
Put the hide in the trash can, punching it down with the stick to make sure it is completely covered in liquid. Let it soak for 40 minutes., Fill the second trash can with clean water while the hide is soaking in the tanning solution. After 40 minutes have passed, use the stick to move the hide from the tanning solution to the clean water. Swish it around to wash off the solution. When the water looks dirty, pour it out, refill it with clean water, and wash the hide for another 5 minutes.


If you plan to use the hide to make clothing, add a box of baking soda to the rinse to neutralize the remaining acid. This will prevent the acid from harming people's skin.
If you don't plan to use the hide to make clothing, you can forgo the box of baking soda, since in neutralizing the acid it lessens the acid's effectiveness in preserving the hide., Remove the hide from the rinse and hang over a beam to drain. Swab it with neat foot oilto condition the skin.

, Hang the hide on a stretcher or hide dryer to finish the process. Place it in a place out of the sun to dry.


After a few days the hide should feel dry and flexible. Take it down from the rack and go over the skin side with a wire brush until it has a suede-like appearance.Let the hide finish drying until it is fully dry, which should take a few more days.

Learn their travel habits.,
Decide on a live or lethal trap.,
Decide on your set.,
Choose your trap.",How to Trap Mink1," Minks travel more than most furbearers, covering up to ten miles a night. They normally follow a definite route. They will usually visit the same spots near water areas every time they are near them. Learning a mink's travel habits will make it easier for you to trap it.;
, Live traps catch the mink without killing it. Lethal traps dispatch the mink. When selecting the type of trap you are going to use, decide if you want to deal with an alive and probably very irritated mink or if you want the trap to dispatch the mink.


Check your state regulations regarding using lethal traps on minks.

, The set is what you will use to lure the mink into your trap. The most common sets either lure the mink to a dark hole using bait (pocket set) or trap the mink on its pathways (blind set).

, There are different types of traps to choose from based on the environment. A body-gripping trap is designed to allow the animal’s head, neck, or torso into the trap’s opening. This trap holds the mink by compressing its jaws around the body. The foothold trap, such as the longspring or coilspring, is a steel-jawed trap that restrains mink by the foot.


Use a No. 11 double longspring, No. 1 ½ coil spring, or a No. 110 Conibear body-gripping trap. These traps are the most effective in trapping and killing the mink.

"

Use this technique to dispatch minks caught in traps.,
Use a foothold trap.,
Place your trap.,
Attach a sliding lock to the end of your trap chain.,
Place an anchor deep in the water.,
Wrap the anchor with wire.,
Bring the wire to the shoreline.,
Tie the free end of the wire to a stake.",How to Trap Mink2," The submersion technique is used to humanely drown the mink and prevent the trapper from dispatching the animal. This is the most common way to kill minks in your trap sets. This technique prevents the mink from resurfacing when it tries to escape from the trap.

, A foothold trap makes it unlikely that the mink will escape. Since the foothold trap gives the mink a limited amount of freedom to move, it is ideal for the submersion technique., Place the trap in the appropriate location based on which set you are using.

, Make sure there are no obstacles that would prevent the lock from sliding freely down the wire. Sliding locks prevent the mink from heading back to the bank. Once the mink realizes that it cannot go any further up the bank, it will head towards the deep water. The lock will follow the mink and prevent it from surfacing.

, Make sure the anchor is deep enough to fully submerge the mink. Use a heavy object such as a rock or a stake as an anchor. Embed the anchor into the stream or riverbed so that it is secure and stable. You want it to be heavy enough to prevent the mink from moving the anchor and freeing itself.On average, the stake needs to be 12 to 18 inches underwater.

, Make sure the wire is wrapped tightly around the anchor so it doesn't unravel when the trap is sprung.

, Place the sliding lock onto the wire. Make sure the sliding lock faces the correct direction. You want the lock to slide down the wire towards the deep water.

, Drive the stake into the bank near your set. Make sure the slide wire is tight.

Use this set to lure the mink to your trap.,
Find a suitable bank.,
Dig a pocket in the bank.,
Place a large branch or small tree trunk above the pocket.,
Place the bait.,
Place the trap.,
Eliminate your scent.",How to Trap Mink3," This set is designed to lure minks to your trap using bait. Pockets sets use a small hole or pocket dug into a river bank.

, Make sure the bank is straight up and down. The bank should also be steep so that the mink cannot reach over from the top and grab the bait while avoiding your trap.

, The pocket’s bottom will be two inches below the waterline. Extend the pocket 1 to 2 feet into the bank, making sure it angles up towards the topsoil. The diameter of the pocket should be around five to six inches.Use a spade or small shovel to easily dig the pocket.

, Use a heavy object to hold the branch in place. This will also help prevent the mink from reaching over the pocket and grabbing the bait.

, Your bait should be either be a fresh fish or a muskrat carcass. Place the bait deep into the hole towards the very back. Impale the bait with something small, such as a stick, and push the bait into the wall of the hole. This will make the mink go deeper into the hole to reach the bait.


You can also use fish oil or raccoon glands as a lure.

, The trap should be at the mouth of the hole. Placing the trap at the entrance ensures the mink is trapped if it decides not to go all the way into the pocket. Use either a body-grabbing or foothold trap. If you use a foothold trap, it should be rigged to drown the mink instantly.


If you are in an area where dogs go do not use meat bait or raccoon gland lures. Place the trap in the very back of the pocket. Make sure the pocket is under the cover of low-hanging branches or exposed tree roots. This will make sure that dogs avoid the trap., While mink are naturally curious, they are also cautious. Minks have a very strong sense of smell and will avoid the trap if they catch your scent. You want to eliminate all human scent from the trap to make it effective. Pour mink urine around a set to eliminate human odor.

"
"
Use this set to trap a mink along its runways.,
Select a visible mink traveling spot.,
Dig a shallow hole.,
Conceal the trap so that the mink falls into it.,
Narrow the mink’s path.,
Eliminate your scent.",How to Trap Mink4," This set uses a trap placed along the traveling paths of the mink. The mink will unknowingly step into the trap while making its nightly rounds. Unlike pocket sets, a blind set does not use bait or a lure.

, Look for tracks, scats, and other signs that minks move through the area. For a wet blind spot, this area is probably near a bank, under a leaning log, around a rock, or at the water’s edge. For a dry blind set, look for where the mink made an overland trail.


While the overland trail might be hard to see, you can find it by looking for bent grass, mink smell, and tracks.

, Place and set a foothold trap in a shallow hole and make sure it’s firmly embedded into the mud. Cover it lightly with leaves, grass, and soil. If it is a wet blind set, push the trap into the waterbed, keeping the trap near the surface of the water.


A No. 110 Conibear trap works well for a dry blind set.
A No. 1½ coil spring works well for a wet blind set.

, You can conceal the trap by lightly covering it with vegetation from the ground. It's important that the area looks like it has not been disturbed.

, Use rocks and sticks to narrow the mink’s travel path to your trap. This will help ensure it walks into your trap.


Look for natural bottlenecks along the mink's path. This will make it easier to ensure the mink crosses your trap.

, While mink are naturally curious, they are also cautious. Minks have a very strong sense of smell. You want to eliminate all human scent from the trap to make it effective. Pour mink urine around a set to eliminate human odor.

Use a live trap if you plan to capture and dispatch the mink yourself.,
Find a suitable spot.,
Dig a hole.,
Secure the cage.,
Camouflage the cage.,
Set the trap.,
Place bait in the trap.,
Check the trap in the morning.",How to Trap Mink5," Use this method to avoid killing non-target animals such as dogs. You will need a cage trap or live trap to capture the mink.

, Unlike the locations in the other sets, you want to find a spot where the mink will not drown. Look for mink signs in the area.Place the trap away from open areas. This will prevent theft, vandalism, and distress to the animal.

, Make sure the hole is dark and deep. Mink are curious creatures and will be attracted to the hole. Make sure the hole is big enough to hold the cage.


Alternatively, you can place the cage in a pre-existing den or hole. If you are trapping the mink near your house, then place the cage in a dark area such as under.

, Press the cage deep into the ground or partially bury it to provide stability. Consider placing an anchor (such as a rock) inside of the cage so that it will not tip or misfire when the mink enters.


You can also use stakes or pegs to secure the trap to the ground

, Cover the cage with surrounding vegetation and debris (such as branches and leaves) to make it appear like a den. Place soil, leaves, branches, and other material on the cage’s base to hide the treadle. Wrap the cage in something dark, like a blanket, if you can.

, Trip it several times to make sure it is functioning. Use a pen or pencil, stick the end through the side of the cage, and push down on the treadles to trip the cage. If you need the doors to close faster, use small stones or weights on top of the door., Use fresh fish or a dead muskrat. Place it at the back of the cage.


You can also use fish oil or raccoon glands as a lure.

, Minks are nocturnal creatures, so the best time to check for their capture is in the morning. Check the cage daily. This helps to prevent people from discovering the trap. It will also keep the mink out of the light and heat during the day."

Use an airgun rather than a firearm.,
Restrain the mink.,
Aim the gun.,
Shoot the mink.,
Confirm death.,
Unload the airgun and check the safety.,
Dispose of the mink.",How to Trap Mink6," Prepare the airgun before you expose the mink from its trap and before you attempt to restrain it. Do not load the gun until the animal has been restrained. Release the safety only when you are prepared to fire. , Use two plywood combs to push the mink firmly against the the cage’s side or roof to keep it still. You want to keep the mink still in order to make an an accurate humane dispatch shot.

, Hold the gun’s muzzle a couple of inches away from the mink’s head. The gun barrel should be perpendicular to the skull.


Avoid aiming at the centerline of the mink's skull because it is very strong.

, A single shot should kill the mink. If a second shot is required, fire as quick and as safely as possible, aiming for brain stem located where the skull and neck meet.

, You can tell if the mink is dead if it collapses Other indications are if the carcass is tonic (meaning the muscles lock and contract) or relaxed. If the mink has a fixed, glazed expression and no corneal reflexes, this indicates that it has been dispatched.


Convulsions may occur after a lapse of one minute., Once you have confirmed death, unload the airgun and put the safety on.

, Check your local ordinances and trapping regulations to find out how to dispose of the carcass

Getting a protective case that is made for your gear and that fits properly will help to ensure it does not get damaged when you are traveling. You may invest in a protective bag for your digital camera and a protective case for your laptop or cellphone.You can shop for protective cases for your cellphone, your laptop, and your digital camera online or in person. When going in person, try out the cases and make sure they fit properly. #*Confirm the cases are sturdy by putting your gear in them and holding them in your hand. You can also try packing the protective cases in your backpack to make sure they fit and are secure.
You should invest in protective cases that are weather resistant and water resistant, as you never know when you'll be caught in bad weather while backpacking.;
, You should also pack your backpack before you start off on your trip to make sure there are designated pockets for all of your gear. Having designated spaces for your gear in your bag can help prevent them from getting damaged or stolen when you are traveling.For example, you may have a small, secure pocket at the front of your backpack for your cellphone as well as a pouch in your bag for your digital camera. You may also have a flat, thin section in your backpack for your laptop.
If you do not have enough pockets or pouches for your tech gear in your backpack, you may considering investing in a different backpack or repacking so there is enough space for all of your gear.

, Be smart and aware of your surroundings when you use technology while backpacking. Avoid taking out your gear in crowded, public spaces such as a busy train station or a packed outdoor square, as these can be spots where your gear could get damaged or stolen. Only use your gear when you absolutely need to, preferably in the privacy of your hostel room or a quiet cafe. This can ensure it does not get misplaced.If you do take your gear out in public, such as your digital camera, make sure it is attached to your body in some way. Keep the camera on a strap around your neck or on a small strap around your wrist. Always keep the gear in its protective case when you are not using it but still carrying it around with you while traveling.
You may also opt to leave most of your tech gear in locker in your hostel or in the locked room you are staying in for the night. This can make it easier for you to walk around in a new space without worrying about your gear and ensure it does not get lost or stolen when you are out.

, You should take steps to make sure the data on your tech gear is secure, as you want to avoid someone else accessing it without your knowledge or approval. The first step to securing your data is protecting all your tech gear with passwords that only you know. Having passwords can help keep your data away from others who get ahold of your gear and ensure it is locked when you are not using it.For example, you may protect your cellphone with a four digit password that only you know. You may also set your cellphone to lock automatically if the password is attempted three times and fails. This can prevent someone from gaining access to data on your phone.

, Though you may end up using public wi-fi when you are backpacking to use gear like a laptop or a cellphone, you should try to limit how much you use it on a regular basis. Public wi-fi, though handy, is also often not very secure. Using public wi-fi can expose your data to others who are also accessing the network. Many public wi-fi spots are also not regularly tested for viruses, leaving your gear exposed to any viruses or network issues that have not been caught.Try downloading Virtual Private Network (VPN) software, which gives you access to a secure server and will encrypt any information you access online using that server. You can find free or cheap VPN software online.
To avoid using public wi-fi, you may invest in a data plan with your cellphone provider before you travel. This will allow you to use your cellular data to access the internet on your phone, which can be useful if you are dealing with sensitive material online, such as banking information or personal emails.

, Get in the habit of backing up your data once a day so you have it in the event your gear gets lost or stolen. You may carry a small, portable external hard drive that you plug into your computer or your camera to back up your data. Or you may use an online service, such as Apple Cloud or Google Drive, to back up your data easily without an external hard drive.Make sure you backup your data often, as you do not want to lose any valuable data if your laptop or your camera ends up getting stolen before you back it up. You may set your computer to remind you to do a back up after several days so you never forget to do this.

, If you do end up losing your tech gear, you should report it stolen or missing to your service providers. This will ensure they can cut off your service right away so your tech gear can not be used by someone else. This is important if you lose your cellphone, for example, and do not want someone to access your data.You should also report your items stolen to the appropriate authorities. You may file a police report with the local authorities in the area and put a flier up about losing your items in the hostel you are staying at. This could increase your chances of getting your items back.

, You can also try using an App like Find My iPhone or Find My iMac if you lose your gear. These Apps help you track your gear by pinpointing their location on a map. You could then go to this location to try to retrieve your gear.There are also other tracking Apps you can download to make it easier to find your devices. Check with the manufacturer of your devices to find out if there are specific tracking Apps you can use.

, If you lose your tech gear while backpacking, and want to ensure you are prepared if it happens again, you may invest in travel insurance for your gear. This is especially important if you are carrying around gear that is expensive, such as a state of the art digital camera or a top quality laptop.You may contact your insurance company to find out their rates for insuring personal items like tech gear. Having travel insurance can help you recover more easily from the loss of your gear.

Wear the right camouflage or else the deer will spot you and run away.,
Relax.,
Find a deer track.,
After following the track for a while to see which direction it is going, check the map to see where the direction will take you.,
Once you know that there isn’t anything that will get in your way, start heading in the direction of the deer.

,
Look out for coyotes or wolves, because you’ll be hunting during deer mating season and they are vulnerable to coyote and wolf attacks.,
Pay attention to the trees and the bushes because the deer may have stopped to eat or defecate; by looking at the faeces and checking its temperature, you can tell how long ago the deer was there.

,
If you find a sign that can tell you that the deer was there within half an hour, you may be extremely close to the deer and may spook it.

,
Once you think you are close to the deer, stop and make a deer call for a minute or two.",How to Stalk a Deer," It's best to wash your stalking clothes by hand without any of the fancy modern fabric cleaning products, since these often have a whitening agent in them to make the clothes seem extra clean. An unfortunate side effect of this is that the clothes then reflect more UV light (which is in the deer's visible spectrum). You'll stand out like a beacon to him if you use these cleaners. (An analogy would be someone stalking you in the fields wearing one of those Dayglo vest that builders and traffic wardens have).;
, Before trying to stalk a deer you ‘’must’‘ be relaxed. Most people get overexcited when they spot a deer so you must remember to stay calm.

, Deer tracks look like two parallel almond-shaped prints that are pointed on the top end. Follow the tracks in the direction of the pointed end.

, Try to avoid following the deer if there are any big rivers or heavy bush to walk through, because deer will run right through it when they are spooked and you will never be able to follow the track.

,, If the coyotes and wolves are hungry enough, there is a chance that they will attack humans, so be careful.

,,, If you hear the deer call back, you know you are within viewing range. Set up and wait for the deer. Once it is close enough to you, try to make the shot.

These have no covering on the front, allowing to go closer to the ground and crawl quieter. If you are hunting, or otherwise close to animals, use a full body suit. These have full covering, so you can walk in a crouch and remain inconspicuous. If you are in a desert or snow filled area, you might want to consider a snipers smock.

, If you get a branch or twig stuck in the mesh of your suit (usually only applies to more modern ones) it is easy not to notice, and very difficult to remove without snapping. It is easy to hear a sound such as that, especially in the environment where other people are looking out for it.

, People may not see what they don't want to, but a pair of boots and a gun lying in the middle of a path is enough to make anyone suspicious.

, place extra padding around your head and shoulders to break up your profile. A head and shoulders are what most often identify people.

, Keep relaxed and regulate your breathing. Doing so will lessen sound from heavy breathing, and will help you keep still. It will also stop your limbs from cramping and shaking.

, If you think someone has seen you, wait until they are about to pull the trigger or shout out. Often they have not. The same goes with animals. Don't just get up and go if you think you have been spotted. If you are playing paintball or airsoft, you have the advantage. You don't have to blow it in a panic. It will also help to stay relaxed (see: relax)

, Keep these in mind when hiding. If you have straight or shiny equipment, camouflage the equipment and add knobs and bumps to any straight part. Do not hide against the skyline.

, People do not look up. If you have the time, and are certain you won't make an overt amount of noise and won't be compromised while climbing or in the tree, and your sight won't be obscured, go for it.

, It can get very hot in a ghillie suit.

, Sneaking around in close proximity will not work if you have a thousand things jingling in your pockets.

, If you need to move or make a noise, listen out for loud ambient noises. Are there birds singing? Wind blowing? Plane flying overhead? If so, try work out a pattern in the noise and move according to that. This will make a huge difference in your chances of being heard.

, This will make less noise, and lessen your chances of stumbling on a nest of animals and startling them, alerting everyone and everything to your presence, or even coming across another stalker. This also lessens your chances of being seen, as the human eye is drawn to movement.

, This will make you even harder to see. Do not, however, hide in very deep shadowed areas unless they are more the rule than the exception. These will automatically draw attention.

, While this might help with animals that have poor depth perception, humans will spot you quickly, as it is unusual for large bushes to grow close to trees in most environments.

, Many people have been discovered by not hiding their face. Camouflaging it is not always good enough, as someone looking right at you will recognize it for what it is. Wear a balaclava and add some padding/vegetation to it. This may sound like superstition, but do not look directly at a person or easily scared animals face. This is the easiest way to get compromised as if you are looking at their face/eyes and they catch your eye while looking around, there isn't much you can do. Rather keep your eyes focused on their torso. Not only will this give you a more accurate general picture, but you can still clearly see their face. Even this is more than enough in most cases to make sure they don't catch your eye.

, Crawl slowly and in time with the wind so that your movement is less obvious and background noise drowns out yours.(see go slow and use ambient noise)

, Do not be afraid to break off twigs from bushes before setting off and stick them into the mesh. Without this your suit will not stand up to any scrutiny. Make sure the colors are that of the biome you will be stalking in.

, Especially if this is one of the first times using it. Drag it through some puddles or through dust to began the fraying of the fibres and to get sand/leaves/anything stuck in there. This will help make it look more natural.

Get the squirrel wet.,
Make a small cut, about 1"" 1/2 (~4 cm), just underneath the base of the squirrel's tail.,
Holding the squirrel, make small cuts through the skin at the back of the hind legs.

,
Holding the squirrel by the tail, separate the hind legs from the skin.,
Rest the squirrel on a stump, piece of scrap lumber or other flat surface clear of dirt and leaves.

,
Grab hold of skin-free hind legs, place your heel on the flap of skin created by your initial cuts, and pull the squirrel by the hind legs.,
Work out the front legs from the hide in the same manner as you did with the rear.,
Continue pulling the hide until its around the squirrel's neck.,
Remove the squirrel's head, arms, and feet.,
Dress the squirrel appropriately.",How to Skin a Squirrel," To keep unwanted hair from getting all over your meat while you are skinning a squirrel, place the squirrel in the water at the edge of a stream or in a bucket. Lay the squirrel belly-down on a flat surface.


You can also douse the animal with a hose prior to continuing if you are back at home. This step is optional and dependent on a water source; however, it is a handy way to reduce the spread of hair onto the meat.;
, Try only to cut the top layer of skin--no deeper. A sharp knife will make your task of cutting through the skin much easier.


You will be cutting under the tail but on top of the tailbone. Do not cut so deep that you affect the tail attachment.

,, Work your fingers around the muscle holding the meat to the skin.

,, Most of the hide should come off in one swift motion. Stop when you get to the front arms.


If there is skin remaining along the squirrel's belly, hold the squirrel securely under its front arms. Pinch the skin tightly with your other hand and pull. This motion should remove remaining belly skin as well as any skin left on the front of the hind legs.

, For the front legs, you won't have to make any incisions; just work your finger in between the hide and the meat, tugging gently.

, Despite having skinned a whole animal, your hands shouldn't be messy at this point if you've skinned correctly.

, Carefully slice through the meat with your hunting knife until you reach bone. Then, with a quick snap of the hand, break the bone in half. Slice through any remaining meat to remove the head, arms, and feet entirely.


It's not advisable to try to slice through bone with your hunting knife. This will dull the hunting knife and even leave small bits of bone in the meat.

, If you have more than one squirrel to skin, skin them all first and then remove all their entrails at once. A couple things to remember when you dress the squirrel:



Inspect the liver before you eat the meat. If the liver looks pale, off-color, or spotted, do not eat the meat. If the liver is deep, dark red and looks healthy, the meat is fine to eat.

, Place the rabbit on a cutting board or another flat surface with enough space for you to work with. On the rabbit’s back pinch its hide and cut it with a sharp knife near the base of the neck. If you’re out on the field, you may use a sharp stick or stone to cut the rabbit open. Use a sharp knife or cleaver just above its knees to cut off the rabbit’s feet. Cut off the head and tail. Use your hand to loosen the skin.When you’ve made the cut, turn the knife edge facing up and cut from the stomach to the neck. Be sure not to pierce the stomach because this can allow its contents to contaminate the meat., Use your index finger and middle finger on both hands to create an opening after you have made your cut. Steady and with a firm grasp, use your fingers to hook up under the skin and pull one of your hands towards the rear and the other hand towards its head.The skin will tear into two pieces. Be sure to keep grabbing more hide to improve your grip and pull to separate. Grab the rabbit carcass by its back legs and gather a handful of skin around one of its ankles. Break the skin by twisting and pulling.The fresher the rabbit, the easier it will be to remove its skin., Tear the fur off the rabbit’s legs with a sharp tug. There will be fur around the feet like shoes. Pull its hide off of its rear. The tail may come off or stay on.Pop the legs through the skin by turning the skin so you can push the rabbits stumps out of them. , Cut the head and tail off if they haven’t come off already.You must open the sides of the sternum to take the rabbit’s windpipe from below its neck and remove it., Cut the feet off at the rabbit’s ankles. Use your hands to snap the feet off the ankles and then a knife to cut through the tendons and muscles. Cut the feet off one by one., Pop the rabbit by its shoulders so that it releases from its coat as you hold down the fur and skin from the carcass. You may use the fur later to make socks or other warm accessories., After you have removed the feet, tail, and head, use a sharp knife to carefully make a small incision around the belly area. You must be careful not to slice open the bladder or colon that lie just underneath the belly., Lift the skin away from the rabbit’s intestines using two fingers. Use your knife to cut from the ribcage down through its pelvis. Cut into the chest cavity to see the lungs and heart. You will also see a membrane separating its intestines from the chest cavity., Place your middle and index fingers at the top of the rabbit’s chest cavity and press against its spine all the way down. Remove the intestines and all its organs by pulling down all in one motion. Make sure everything is all the way out as you keep pulling down.Allowing the rabbit to decompose is unhealthy. Make sure you remove the innards immediately or else your meat will become rotten. Don’t cut the intestines because it will produce a rank odour and the insides may contaminate your meat. Reach toward the ribs to remove them., Clear the colon by cutting through the pelvic bone. Be sure not to damage it. Clean the chest and abdominal cavity by pulling out any remaining pieces of innards or remaining membranes., It is muscular and below the heart and lungs. Remove both the lungs and heart. Some people enjoy eating the heart and lungs but it’s a matter of personal taste., Near the tail, cut a small section and find the rectal area to remove any poop. Be thorough so as not to contaminate the rest of the meat., The heart, kidneys, and liver can all be cooked in a variety of ways. You may keep them in tact and try out different recipes. Make sure that the liver is a deep red. The rabbit may be unhealthy if the liver looks abnormal with muddled spots or discoloration. If that’s the case, do not eat the meat., Go to a sink and be sure to wash both the inside and outside of the rabbit thoroughly. Clean off any debris, blood, or hair left from the field dressing process.If you are in the field, make sure to use a fresh running water source or boil water and clean the rabbit.

, Silver skin is the rabbit’s skin as well as little pieces of fat. Use a very sharp knife or cutting utensil. This may be very tedious but be patient and careful not to cut yourself., The front legs are not attached by bone to the rest of the body so, after you have removed the silver skin, remove as much meat as possible by cutting close to the rabbit’s ribcage.Remove the front legs by cutting just underneath the shoulder blades., Similar to bacon from a pig, this is a choice cut of meat. Use a sharp knife to trim close up against the rabbit’s loin and down its ribs. Do this for both sides of the rabbit., Use a sharp knife to cut from the hip joint through the meat of the back leg. Use your fingers to remove the meat and snap off each leg.Remove the back legs by cutting through the hip sockets., After you remove its legs, remove its pelvis. Fillet the back loin and ribs cutting against the spine and through the ribs. Don’t cut any meat off the ribcage. Cut it away from the ribs. Cut both sides of the ribs from the spine; then, cut off the neck and ribcage as one piece with the pelvis.You can make rabbit stock with the neck, ribcage, and pelvis.

, For serving and portioning your meat, cut the loins/spine into three sections. The loins, the top and bottom of the spine, and the back legs have the most meat.You may use the ribs, neck, and pelvis in a stock pot and cook the remaining meat which include: 2 back legs, 2 front legs, 2 belly meats, and 3 loin sections.

Let the pelt dry some until the fat can harden.,
Start scraping the fat away from the tail.,
Remove the rest of the fat.,
Stretch the pelt onto the stretching board.,
Let the pelt hang in a cool dark place.",How to Skin a Raccoon," When you've acquired game the primary goal of which is the pelt, there are two basic methods of proceeding. Casing refers to removing the pelt from the carcass, starting around the back feet and working forward, pulling it off in one big piece. This is the best way to proceed. It's not usually recommend that you attempt to remove the organs first, which can ruin the valuable pelt.


Open-skinng is typically only used on beavers and a few other animals. This involves removing the organs first, via a vertical slit up the torso of the animal, then removing the pelt and the tail at once. This isn't recommended for raccoons.;
, Raccoons have a reputation for acquiring a lot of dirt, since they're scavenging creatures, which means you'll need to take a bit of time to clean them before getting started. Hang the carcass from a skinning gambrel by the feet, hooked through the tendon just behind the ankles to clean them.If the raccoons appear to be fairly clean, run a hairbrush through the fur in the direction of the tail, end, to get out any debris, twigs, and dirt that might be difficult to see. If the raccoon seems clean, it's ok to start skinning.
If you've got a muddy raccoon, hose it down until the water runs clear, hang them by a front foot and hose them down until they run clear water, then let dry thoroughly before starting. If at all possible, it's best to avoid this, because the stiff bristles of the raccoon fur can become a lot more pliable and (to some people) less desirable if you rinse it.

, To get started, make a cut through the pelt between the legs of the animal, from the inside of one ankle to the next. Think of it like the inseam on a pair of jeans, connecting your cut from one ankle to the next in a ""V"" shape.


""Cuff"" the incision by running your knife around both ""ankles"" of the raccoon, loosening the skin. This will allow you to start pulling the skin down clearly.







, Cut about an inch or so in diameter around the anus, starting at the base of the tail, where it connects to the body. Obviously, it's usually best to wear gloves at all times when you're skinning raccoons.


Be very careful at this point not to cut too deeply and cut into the meat. The last thing you want to do is puncture the intestines right around the anus, which can taint the fur and the meat, if you want to use it.

, Run your knife all the way down the length of the tail in a straight line. To keep the pelt as neat as possible, it's important to use caution and be very exacting in your cut. Go slowly and pull the tail taut while you run it straight from the base to the tip.


For some raccoons, depending on the size, it may be difficult to get all the way down to the tip of the tail. It's common to go about halfway, then use a tail-stripper to hold the fur in place while you pull the tail up and out of the fur.
To use a tail-stripper, you'll probably have to work the fur down the hind legs and around the hips to expose the base of the tail more easily to get it started. Tail-stripers are common tools that are used in skinning foxes, raccoons, and other animals, and are available at most outdoors outfitters.

, If you've ever skinned a rabbit, the pulling the skin down a raccoon is similar, but a little more tenacious. You'll basically just start pulling the fur downward, toward the head, as if you were stripping off a jumpsuit. Keep pulling until you get to the shoulders.


If you need to use your knife to help the skinning process, remember to always cut behind the skin and into the membrane, not into the skin itself. Don't get reckless and start scraping away with your knife. Go slowly and use pressure to pull the skin, and let the knife ease any difficult parts, disconnecting any stubborn membrane from the flesh.
On male raccoons, you'll have to cut the genitals away from the carcass using your knife. It'll stay attached to the fur, and you can remove it later during the fleshing and stretching process.

, When you get to the forearms, it's usually recommended that you put the knife away. It's a fatty area, and gets somewhat difficult to distinguish meat from fur, so it's a better idea to use your fingers and go slowly, avoiding the knife and accidental cuts through the pelt.Pull the fur loose around and over the shoulders, down to about the elbow. You can make another cuff cut at that point and separate the fur from the arms. It should now just be attached around the neck.

, Expose the face of the raccoon and use your knife to cut around the eyes and the ears. Return your attention to the skin side, and keep pulling the pelt down and free of the flesh, working it up the neck and to the jaw. At this point, you'll probably need to use the knife to run along the top jawline on both sides, to separate the pelt from the mouth. Keep pulling until the pelt comes almost entirely free.

, At this point, there should be a strong point of cartilage that connects the nose to the skin. You're almost done. Just use your knife to cut through it and the pelt should come free in one big piece. Don't pull to hard to try to separate the pelt, because you risk ripping it and damaging the skin. Cut through the cartilage and you'll be done.

, Raccoons are sometimes eaten, though some sources estimate that as many as 40% of raccoons in North America suffer from intestinal parasites like roundworms, which can make you sick.Raccoons are also scavengers, meaning that they're exposed to a number of diseases and infections. Examine the skin and the flesh of the animal closely for spots, discoloration, or any other signs of infection. If it looks suspect, discard it.


If you want to try raccoon and determine that the meat is clean, gut the carcass as you would a rabbit. While less popular than certain other wild game because of the strong and some say unpleasant flavor, brining raccoon for a long period of time and cooking it properly is considered by some to be a delicacy. If you're after more than just the fur, you can learn to prepare the meat in the following section.

, Flesh-scrapers and stretching boards are about as primitive a tool as you can get, but it's still the most effective way for getting the flesh, cartilage, and fatty bits off of the pelt so that it can dry thoroughly.


A flesh scraper is basically what it sounds like: a short and sharp blade that's used to scrape the flesh away. In a pinch, you could use a big kitchen knife that's somewhat dull, but it might be a little more difficult than with a scraper. Hog scrapers, single and double-handed scrapers are all common.
Metal and wooden boards are both commonly used for the job. If you use a wooden stretching board, you'll also need staples or push-pins to secure the pelt when you're ready to stretch it for drying.
Wooden stretching boards can double as ""fleshing boards,"" providing a nice surface to scrape the pelt on. If you have a metal stretcher, you'll just need to use a bench, table, or other flat surface on which to scrape the pelt.

, It's usually recommended to let the fur alone to firm up the fat some in a cool environment (about 55 degrees F, or 13 C). This will help to make the scraping job a lot easier. You can flatten out the pelt onto the board, fur side down, to let it dry for several hours before you get started scraping. When you start, the whole process of scraping itself shouldn't take more than 15 or 30 minutes.

, Using firm pressure, carefully scrape the fat and connective tissue away from the skin using the scraper. There's not much of a secret or a science to it–you're basically just scraping. Be gentle to avoid tearing through the skin, but be firm enough and even enough to get everything off.


The tail is usually the most challenging part, so most trappers will start there, spending the most time making sure that every bit of fat is evenly scraped away.

, After removing the fat from the tail, scrape directly up the middle of the pelt, in a stripe. Go all the way up until you've scraped everything off a narrow strip up the middle of the pelt, and the head of the pelt. Then go back and scrape outward, extending evenly to the sides. This will help start the stretching process and flatten out the pelt.Keep using even pressure and slowly scraping off all the fat and other bits as you work. It shouldn't take that long, but be thorough. If you miss anything, you risk ruining the pelt with rot.

, Metal stretches are usually one-peice mechanisms that allow you to secure the pelt easily without additional tools. With a wooden stretching board, you'll typically need to use push-pins or staples to stretch out the pelt.


Stretch the pelt tightly, so it flattens out and looks clean, but not so stretched that it thins out the skin and makes it look weak. It'll also shrink some while it stretches, so you want to make sure it'll be able to comfortably.
The pelt should be starfish-stretched out, all the limbs and the tail taut and extended. Don't let the arms hang loosely, or the pelt won't look right.

, 55 to 60 degrees F (13 to 15 degrees C) is the perfect drying environment for a pelt. Make sure it's free from sunlight and temperature fluctuations. Depending on the climate, pelts should hang for anywhere between a day and a week. You'll know it's done when the skin is firm and taut, with a plastic-like touch.

, First, cut the skin around the neck at the base of the skull. Second, cut the skin down the front of the neck, down the chest, down the abdomen, to the genital area.


After your initial incision on the neck, make the rest of the cut with the knife blade facing up. This helps prolong the blade's life (as the blade does not cut through the fur) and minimizes the chance of you accidentally puncturing an organ.
Take care that you only cut through the skin and membrane, but not into the muscles.

, Make incisions from the incision on the chest, down the forelegs and circumscribe the legs above the knees.

, Use your hands to pull the skin off of the legs and neck, working down towards the chest.


If muscle tissue is coming off with the hide, use a small knife to cut any underlying membrane.

, Ball up the hide around the golf ball. The ball will help provide grip for the next step.

, Tie a rope around the pocket of skin containing the golf ball. Then pull the other end of the rope to pull the hide off. Alternatively, you can attach the other end of the rope to a vehicle and use the vehicle to pull the hide off.

, Once the hide is removed, rinse the carcass with clean water to remove any hair.

It's very important to get all of the flesh off of the hide so that it doesn't begin to rot.Don't wait too long to flesh the hide after you've skinned the deer. If the hide begins to decompose it won't hold up during the tanning process.
Use a fleshing tool intended for scraping flesh from a hide, rather than a knife. Sharp tools could pierce the hide and damage it.;
, Make sure you put down a fairly thick layer of salt to draw out the moisture from the pelt. Use 3-5 pounds of salt, depending on how large the hide is.


The salting process takes a day or two if the proper amount of salt is used. Keep adding salt to the hide until it dries out and becomes crispy.
Cover wet areas of the hide with more salt.

, Before you use the brine solution, soak the hide in clean water until it is soft and flexible. This helps it absorb the tanning chemicals. Peel off the dried inner skin from the hide.

, This solution relaxes the hide and helps to preserve it, an essential step in the tanning process.Here's what you'll need:


2 gallons water
1 1/2 gallons bran flake water (Make this by boiling 1 1/2 gallons of water and pouring it over a pound of bran flakes. Let the mixture sit for one hour, then strain and reserve the water.)
8 cups salt (not iodized)
1 1/4 cups formic acid
1 box baking soda
2 large trash cans
1 large stick, for stirring and moving hides

, Put the salt in a trash can and pour 2 gallons of boiling water inside. Add the bran flake water and stir until the salt has completely dissolved. Add the formic acid. Put the hide in the trash can, punching it down with the stick to make sure it is completely covered in liquid. Let it soak for 40 minutes. Remove the hide from the brining solution and drain.


Make sure you wear gloves and take other precautions to prevent getting burned from the acid.

, Mix an ounce of baking soda for every 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of water needed to cover the hide in a large garbage can. Place the hide in the neutralizing solution, and stir for 20 minutes. Remove the hide from the neutralizing solution, rinse, and drain.

, Remove the hide from the rinse and hang over a beam to drain. Rub it with neat's foot oil to condition the skin.

, Hang the hide on a stretcher or hide dryer to finish the process. Place it in a place out of the sun to dry. After a few days the hide should feel dry and flexible. Take it down from the rack and go over the skin side with a wire brush until it has a suede-like appearance. Let the hide finish drying until it is fully dry, which should take a few more days."

, If you wish to mount the deer's head and shoulders, you need to take care not to damage the cape when skinning. This skinning method will leave plenty of intact cape for any shoulder mounting.


The first incision you should make is around the chest of the animal at the bottom of the sternum (or breastbone).
After your initial incision, make the rest of your cuts with the knife blade facing up. This helps prolong the blade's life (as it is not cutting through the fur) and minimizes the chance of you accidentally puncturing an organ.

, Now make incisions around the forelegs, halfway between the knees and the armpits. After circumcising the forelegs. Extend the incision up from the circumcision to the armpit. The incision running up the leg should follow the line where the brown and white fur meet.


Take your time to do the leg incisions correctly, follow where the brown and white fur meet carefully.

, Once you have finished following the white fur/brown fur inter-phase up the leg and into the armpit, continue the cut straight back and intersect with the incision around the chest. When done, this cut should run parallel to the body of the deer.

, Slowly with a small knife cut the underlying membrane and peel back the hide. As you skin, roll the cape off of the carcass to avoid getting too much hair on the meat.


Be careful not to cut the hide.

, After you have removed all of the skin off of the forelegs, chest and neck you are ready to remove the head. To do this, about four inches behind the skull use a small sharp knife to cut through the muscle down to the bone. Once you reach the vertebrae use a small bone saw to cut the bone and remove the head.


You are not cutting the skin in this step. The neck skin should already be be peeled back.
Your taxidermist will use this 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) of neck to make the measurements needed to pick an appropriately sized mannequin for your mount.

, You can now skin the rear of the animal using any means. When done, rinse the carcass to remove any fur stuck to the meat.

, Place the cape and head into a bag to immediately bring to your local taxidermist.

Flesh the hide.,
Rinse the hide.,
Let the hide dry out.,
Remove the hair.,
Make the tanning solution.,
Tan the hide.,
Soften the hide.,
Smoke the hide.",How to Tan a Deer Hide2," The first part of the tanning process is always scraping off all bits of flesh and fat from the skin. It helps to place the hide on either a fleshing beam or a garbage bag or tarp on the ground. Scrape all pieces of flesh and fat off the hide with a fleshing tool.

, Wash it down with clean water to remove the dirt, blood and bits of flesh. You can use some castile soap or another type of soap made from natural substances to help loosen the grit.

, Attach the hide to a drying rack and set it out for a few days to let it dry before you begin soaking it in tanning fluids.


Drying racks can be purchased at game shops. These wooden structures are useful for holding the hide in place while it dries.
The hide should be stretched across the drying rack, rather than simply hung up. Otherwise the edges will curl.

, Use a rounded steel blade with a handle or a traditional elk antler hide scraper to scrape the hide from the skin against the grain. This helps the tanning solution absorb more thoroughly into the hide. Take care not to tear the skin where it is thinner in the belly area.

, Place the deer's brain and a cup of water in a saucepan. Cook the mixture until the brain breaks down and turns to liquid. The mixture should resemble a soup. Blend it so that it's completely smooth and lump-free.

, First wash the hide with water once more, to remove any last bits of hair or debris and make the hide more malleable. Squeeze it out between two towels to extract the excess moisture. Now pour some of the brain mixture on the hide and rub it in with your hands. Rub an even amount of the mixture over the entire hide, covering every inch.


You can use gloves to apply the tanning mixture if you'd prefer not to use your bare hands.
When you're finished applying the tanning solution, roll up the hide and place it in a large food storage bag or freezer bag. Put it in the refrigerator for 24 hours to give the brains time to soak in.

, To keep the hide from getting too stiff, it's necessary to soften it by working it and pulling at the edges. Take it out of the refrigerator and place it back on the drying rack. Wipe off the excess brain mixture with a cloth. Use a large stick to soften the hide by running it back and forth across the skin until it becomes soft and pliable.


You can also use a heavy rope to soften the hide.
Another way to soften it is to take it off the drying rack and worth with a partner to run it back and forth across a log or bench.

, This is the last step in the natural tanning process. Sew the hide up the sides to create a bag. Close one end so that it is tight enough to keep smoke inside. Dig a hole about 1⁄2 foot (0.2 m) deep and 1 foot (0.3 m) across, and place the open end of the hide bag over the hole, with the top propped up by sicks, tee-pee style. Build a small fire inside the bag, in the hole, so that the smoke from the fire will rise and smoke the skin.


When the flames have died down and the fire begins to smoke, add smoke chips to the fire to create more smoke and keep it alive. Close the open part and leave a small vent through which you can add more fuel to the fire.
After half an hour, turn the bag inside out and smoke the other side.

Pack enough clothing for the duration of your camping trip.
Bring a flashlight for use at night.
Bring a portable toilet and toilet paper if your campsite will not have restroom facilities.
Pack a first-aid kit.;
,


Wear a sturdy pair of hiking boots. The boots should be waterproof.
Wear a thermal shirt and pants along with socks that are made from wool or synthetic materials as your base layer. Do not wear clothing made of cotton, as it dries slowly and will make it difficult to remain warm if it rains or snows.
Wear a layer of fleece clothing as the second layer.
Wear a waterproof and windproof outer layer. Ask an employee at a sporting goods store for such clothing if you are unsure of what will work.
Wear a winter hat and gloves.

,


Keep in mind that it often takes twice as long to walk or hike in winter as it does in warmer times, as snow or ice may be present.
Note that winter days are shorter than the days are in any other time of year. This will affect the amount of time you have for hiking and any activities you would like to do.
Check the weather forecast before you leave. Consider postponing your trip if there is severe weather in the forecast.

Take care of the ducks you've hunted.",How to Start Duck Hunting," Hunting includes killing animals, and for some people, it's too much to handle. If you don't think you can get a little blood on your hands, you probably shouldn't be duck hunting.;
, There are places all over the world to duck hunt, you just need to find them. You can find people all over that have private land where you can pay to hunt exclusively, and that is where some of the best duck hunting is. But, if you don't want to spend a whole lot of money to hunt on private land, there are also a few wildlife areas and public lands that can provide good duck hunting, if you know where to go. Most people hunt around ponds, lakes and rivers, and, the more secluded your area is, the less competition you will have. Don't be afraid to ask some other people you know about where there is the best duck hunting and when the best time to go is. They can also tell you areas that are available but some people might be a little protective of there secret place so do some scouting and try different places throughout the season to see which areas do better than others.

, When deer or elk hunting, it's not mandatory to wear camouflage because they are color blind. But, when duck hunting, it is much more important because when the ducks come in to land, they will see anything out of the ordinary, so it is imperative that you have good camouflage and that you stay hidden when the ducks are flying around.

,


You will need a hat that's camouflage and one that is waterproof so your head doesn't get wet when it rains.
You will also need a heavy warm coat that's camo, and waterproof is preferred. The warmer and dryer you are, the less miserable you will be and the more fun you will have.
Some camo gloves are nice to have, too.
One thing that is really good to have is a pair of chest waders; most likely you will be hunting by water and some good hunting ponds are only accessible by wading. Waders can also be used to retrieve ducks and setting decoys.

, You will only be allowed to use a shotgun, and you need one that is dependable and will still work when it gets dropped in the mud.


Most people use 12 gauge shotguns but you can also use a 20 gauge (which is smaller) or a 10 gauge (which is bigger.) For hunting, try to find one with at least a 27 inch (68.6 cm) barrel length; the longer the barrel, the farther you can shoot. Try to get one with a 3 inch (7.6 cm) or even better a 3.5 inch (8.9 cm) chamber. You can use 3 shot or 2 shot shells, but, if you are hunting geese or larger ducks, you can use BB. Make sure you have the right caliber and length to fit your shotgun and that you only use steel shot. However, when you use steel shot, make sure you use a modified choke instead of a full choke; using a full choke with steel shot can mess up your pattern and decrease your chances of hitting ducks. one of the most common shotguns are Remington 870 because they are so reliable and are cheaper but there are also Mossbergs, benellis, and countless others so just ask around and get some opinions.

, Ducks can fly all around you all day, if you don't have any decoys or calls, most of them will stay out of range.


Try using 6 good looking decoys than 2 dozen bad ones or, in other words, quality over quantity. If you have both, that's even better! Brand new decoys are very expensive but you can find used ones in good condition for a lot less, you just need to look around for some. It's normally a good idea to have at least a dozen but there are times when less is better. there are many different techniques to setting decoys, try doing a U shape with the bottom of the U up wind. When ducks land, they fly into the wind to stop more easily. Be sure to leave enough space in the middle of the U, for other ducks to land. If there is no room for them to land, they will either fly away or land out of range.

, Calling is an art that takes practice, practice, and practice, and is important to get the ducks attention and to get them to come closer. if used correctly calling can be a very effective way to get ducks but there are to many hunters that can't call and/or don't know when to call. duck calls range from $5 to $100 but just because a call is more expensive does not mean it works better. if you suck at calling it doesn't matter how much money you spend, you will still suck, you just need to watch videos on how to duck call and ask for tips but most importantly practice makes perfect.

, Boats and can be useful for many different things. They can take you to places that you can't normally get to or you can hunt out of them. If you decide to use them to hunt out of you will have to camouflage it pretty well and you will need to make sure that you and anybody else you're hunting with are well hidden. When hunting out of a boat, set your decoys all around it, but you need to be careful not to get your engine caught in any of the lines.

, Dogs can be very useful if they are trained properly and are well behaved otherwise they will just run around and scare the ducks away and cause more harm than good. If trained correctly they can find ducks that have hid and you may not have found by yourself and retrieve them quicker too. See How to Train Your Dog to Hunt.

, Each state has its own laws and it is your responsibility to know when and where you are allowed to hunt waterfowl. Most states have their own fish and wildlife website where you can look up season dates and the legal limits on what types of ducks and geese you can shoot.

, Wait until you see what kind of duck they are before you shoot it. Learn how to identify ducks. It is very important to be able to identify different types of ducks on the fly.


Look at pictures of the different types of ducks in your area. There are dozens of different species but not all of them will be where you hunt so get used to seeing what different types of ducks look like in the water and in the air.
A few key ways to tell what type of duck it is is by looking at the size of the body (e.g. mallards are some of the biggest ducks while mergansers are some of the smallest). Also look at the color of the head (mallard drakes have green heads while the hens have brown heads). You can also look at the shape and length of the bills (mallard drakes have yellow bills while widgeons have a smaller and grey bill) and you can look at the color of the wing and the bird's wingspan (mallards have a purple patch on their wings).

, After the day is over and you killed a few ducks you have to do something with them.


Most people do what they call breasting. That is where you cut up the center of the belly and on each side there is one breast for a total of two per bird.  You cut out each breast and put them in a bag and freeze it until you're ready to cook it.
Plucking is where you pull off all of the feathers and gut it out and then you just cook it like a Thanksgiving turkey.

Hunting deer without a permit and the proper equipment, or hunting deer out of season is always illegal. Generally, a seasonal permit for deer costs between $40-$100.


For safety purposes, it's important to wear blaze orange to help distinguish yourself from the foliage, for other hunters who might be in the area. Contrary to popular belief, deer can't see well enough to make camouflage particularly effective, though it is helpful in making your movements less visible, which are what alerts deer to your presence.
Many different rifles are used for hunting deer, a .243 up to a 30-.06 or 30-30 caliber will do perfectly well for any deer you're likely to encounter. Hunting with shotguns is somewhat less common, though deer slugs are available for hunting deer.

Bow hunting is also extremely common for hunting deer. In most areas, 45 pounds draw weight is the legal limit, which means you'll have a typical target distance from 20-60 yards.;
, Talk to local hunters and visit the website of the local Department of Wildlife or Department of Natural Resources to learn about public areas permissible for hunting. State and National park lands are sometimes made available at particular times for hunting deer.


It's also common to hunt on private property with the permission of the local landowners. If you know someone with good rural deer-hunting property, get in touch and ask if you can come out next season.
Never assume an area is safe for hunting if you're not sure. Never trespass on private land without the permission of the landowners.

, While your smell may seem insignificant in the woods, scent control is a big concern when you're hunting deer. Ideally, you want to avoid using scented soaps, deodorant, and being around any strong perfume-like smells for 24-48 hours prior to a hunt. It's common to avoid showering for a day or two before going hunting.


Keep jackets and clothing in Rubbermaid containers with spruce bows to make you smell like the woods.
No drinking alcohol or eating fatty foods the night before hunting, so you're not exuding strong smells that will alert deer to your presence.
Some hunters will layer baking soda in between layers of hunting clothing to try to mask their scent further.

, When you head out hunting, it's usually common to wander for a while and look for an ideal deer spot and set up camp to wait. You want to find evidence of a heavily travelled trail, preferably one that leads to an open area or meadow, depending on the weapons lethal distance.


Keep an eye out for deer-friendly food sources, like apples or corn, as well as available water sources where deer are likely to congregate.
Ideally, a field about 60 yds in diameter would be perfect for hunting deer. If you have a longer range rifle with an accurate, sighted-in scope, a larger meadow (300 yds long or so) would be desirable.
One of the most obvious signs of the presence of deer is antler rub on trees, which is done by bucks to mark territory and share scent., When you've found an ideal spot for hunting, set up camp and get to work making the deer come to you. There are lots of different ideas about how to camouflage yourself. Tree stands and blinds can be used in areas where game is likely to pass, but the thrill of tracking and sneaking up on a deer effectively is prized among certain hunters, who prefer to find cover in the wild. The choice is up to you.



Make the deer come to you. Deer calls, estrus spray, urine, and rattling antlers are all common ways of attracting deer to your position, especially early in the season.

, Solo hunting can be dangerous and difficult, and it's always recommended that you go hunting with at least one other person. Packing out a whole deer by yourself is a challenge for even the strongest hunters, and the whole job is made easier and more fun with other experienced hunters to help the process along.


Always let someone else know where you're going hunting, and when you're likely to return for safety purposes, especially if you'll be out of cellphone range.
Don't bring dogs when hunting deer. Although they're good to have around when hunting fowl and other birds, dogs are too loud and will only serve to scare off deer.

, There are a variety of positions from which it is possible to make an accurate shot, and a good hunter needs to be comfortable in all of them. Practice getting into position in a safe place with an unloaded gun, well before you go out hunting.


Prone position is the most stable, but it is the most difficult and impractical position to get into in the field, while standing is the simplest, fastest, and unfortunately most unstable. Crouching or sitting positions are the most comfortable and stable positions for shooting deer accurately, if done properly.
You can crouch quickly, supporting your elbow with your knee or thigh, making your aim more true and stable. In the sitting position, you'll sit cross-legged, perpendicular to your target, with the knee of your non-shooting hand pointing toward the target.

, Hunting deer is usually an all-day activity, not something to do when you're rushed or impatient. Find a good spot to sit in wait when you go out hunting, and give it some time. Deer are more likely to come around an area that's been silent and still for quite a while, so be extremely quiet as you do so.


Some hunters like to give a spot a couple hours then move around some, while others like to roam more or less constantly. It's your choice how you want to hunt, but most successful hunters do some combination of setting up to wait and trying out different areas.
The waiting is part of the thrill and the drama of the hunt. If it wasn't challenging, nobody would bother.

, If you've spotted a deer, don't start pulling the trigger just yet. Use binoculars to look for signs of deer coming into the area and wait until one orients itself to your position in a way that offers you a clean shot. This is the most critical moment of the hunt, and the last thing you want to rush.


Depending on the laws in your area and the type of permit you've acquired, take a minute to verify that the deer you're seeing is legal. Often, only bucks displaying a certain amount of antler growth (usually six points) are legal to harvest, though this varies from region to region.
If the first deer you see isn't legal, don't shoo it off. Wait. Deer often travel in pairs or herds and there are likely to be more deer coming soon.

, As you wait for the deer to orient itself to you, pull your rifle into position and obtain a good sight picture, aligning your eye with the sight of the rifle.While it's most common to aim just behind the shoulder of the deer, there are a variety of philosophies regarding where, specifically, you should aim on a deer, so the pros and cons of each spot follow:



Behind the front leg, 5-7 in. up from the chest is probably the most popular spot to aim. This shot will penetrate the heart and lungs, though deer don't always go down immediately with this shot, and will sometimes recover, meaning that you often have to do some tracking.

The head, through the brain, offers an instant kill, and there is very little meat lost to a head shot. Typically, you'll aim just behind the eye to make this shot, a fairly advanced and difficult shot to make, with the potential for missing completely. It also renders the deer impossible to taxidermy for a trophy, if you're interested in saving the antlers or the whole head.

The neck, through the spine, is another popular and lethal spot, hit by aiming just behind the jawline of a deer showing you its broadside. This shot will often paralyze a deer, requiring a second shot or throat slit to finish the job, making it slightly less desirable.

, Once you've taken aim, you need to breathe, relax, and ensure that you make the most accurate shot possible. Switch the safety off your rifle and get ready to shoot. The most accurate and controlled moment to squeeze the trigger is the moment immediately following an exhale, so don't hold the rifle in place for too long, or you'll start to sway. Do it swiftly, carefully, and efficiently. BRASS is an acronym that will help you remember the procedure:



Breathe

Relax

Aim

Stop breathing

Squeeze the trigger

, Make sure you are 100% certain that what you're shooting at is a deer. Many hunting accidents happen because people don't get a clear picture of whatever it is they're going to shoot at. It's too late by the time you pull the trigger.


It's also important to be aware of your surroundings, so you know what's behind the deer as well. You don't want to be shooting towards another person, a private residence, a public road, or other places you wouldn't shoot.

, Wherever you've shot the deer, it will often take off, bounding away. It's important to wait a few minutes and not immediately charge after the deer, which can give the deer and adrenaline jolt, making the tracking job much more difficult. If you made a good shot, it won't get far and will lay down to die quickly, so waiting a few minutes won't make a bit of difference.


Take care to remember the general spot you made the hit and the general direction that the deer took off. Mark the spot on your GPS if necessary.

, Head to the spot the deer stood when you shot it and examine the ground for signs of blood, then pick up the trail. You can also check out the quality of the blood for signs of how accurate your shot was.


If you see thin blood, or bile on the ground, you missed your shot and you'll likely have to track the deer quickly to make a more humane kill. A gut-shot deer will take a long time to die, so you've got a responsibility to find it and speed up the process.

, Deer move quickly, even when wounded, and it's possible for them to cover quite a bit of ground after being shot mortally. You may have to off-road it a bit, but if you've made an accurate shot, you shouldn't have to follow for more than a few hundred yards at most. It's important to examine the ground and foliage up off the ground for blood and follow the deer's trail.


Some hunters like to use a bit of hydrogen peroxide to spray around foliage if the blood proves difficult to spot at any point. It should foam up and make the blood much more visible.

, When you come up on the deer you've tracked, examine it closely from afar before you approach. Watch to see whether or not it is breathing, or moving. If you hit the deer in the chest, foamy blood is a good sign. That means you've probably penetrated the lungs, and the deer should die very quickly, if it's not dead already.


If the deer is still alive and doesn't seem close to death, approach it carefully, maintaining a safe distance, before taking a more accurate shot through the brain or chest and putting it down.
Be extremely careful when approaching a wounded deer. Some hunters like to use a knife to slit the deer's throat and let it bleed out, though an angry, wounded deer with a big rack of antlers can be extremely dangerous.

, As soon as the deer is dead, you should get to work field-dressing the carcass for safe consumption and breaking it down to a manageable size for packing out, or heading back to camp. Depending on where you are and how far out you are from where you're going, there are a variety of ways to approach the task.


A good-quality and well-sharpened hunting knife is an invaluable tool when you're out hunting. You don't want to have just made a kill and find out you're without tools.
If you're close to home or camp, or have access to an ATV or other vehicle, you might bring the whole deer back and hoist it before skinning and gutting the deer.
If you've got a long hike on foot, remove the entrails and pull the major organs from the rib cage, being careful not to puncture the stomach or intestines. There will be several membranes attaching the organs to the spine, which you'll also need to cut. Generally, most hunters will then ""break"" the hind quarters and the fore, to make the carcass more easy for packing out, then butcher it later.

,,


Look for a mud hole near a creek bed called a hog wallow. Near the wallow you should see a hog rub at the base of small trees that will appear scratched and caked in mud.







,


Look for signs of hogs digging up roots and digging into rotting tree trunks. Be cautious if you find any tell-tale signs of activity like hog wallows, hog rubs, or hog rooting.







,


Look for specific hog shaped prints while tracking. A hog track resembles a deer-sized track except it lacks pointed grooves, and it has larger rounded front tracks without dewclaw prints.

,


Look for the highway trail that is used the most in the area. A highway trail may be several miles long with minor trails branching off. This is the best area to scout from.

,


Do not confuse hog scat for deer droppings; the pellets of hog scat are three times larger with remnants of hair and bone.







,


Home for the hog is a “hot spot” called a hog bed, which is nothing more than a bowl shaped hole in the ground used to hide and rest in. The hog bed is called a hot spot because they are hard to spot, making it easier to stumble on a sleeping hog. Be cautious! If you accidentally disturb a sleeping hog be prepared for an unprovoked attack.







, Choose to either:


Scout the area from a camouflaged hide until you make a positive identification of the hog;
Plan a way to safely ambush the hog by engaging from a far away distance.

Think about the foods you want to eat that require refrigeration, then compare them against the size of your cooler. RVers with refrigerators will have more space available than tent campers who have ice chests and can only carry the essentials.
Eliminate unnecessarily refrigerated food items. Many refrigerated necessities waste space, such as ketchup and mayonnaise. Instead, use single-serve ketchup and mayonnaise condiment packages you've collected from fast food restaurants. Other substitutions for refrigerated items include using powdered milk, cheese and eggs instead of fresh dairy items.
Include other space-saving alternative food items on your list, such as tortillas flat bread and graham crackers which can take the place of bread.;
, Many national parks, forests and wilderness areas require visitors to preregister for campfire permits and more are requiring hikers to make reservations for hiking on popular trails. Learn what your responsibilities are in advance to ensure rapid access to your weekend camping destination.

Check the cot.",How to Put a Cot Together," The cot should have three separate pieces: a metal frame with canvas attached to it and two separate metal rails.


When you first get the cot, the primary metal frame will likely be folded up. You should be able to see the canvas attached to the frame as it is folded, though.
The two separate metal rails will be used for support, and they will slide into the ends of the attached canvas once the frame has been opened up.;
, Unfold the frame until the side rails of the cot are straight. The legs of the cot should also be unfolded and positioned on one side of the side rail bars.Note that the side rails are the metal support bars attached to the canvas portion of the cot. The legs are the metal bars that are not attached to the canvas.
There should be two parallel sets of side rails and three sets of legs. The legs should all be perpendicular to other side rail.
The cot should only fold out in one direction. If you sense resistance, try folding the cot out in the opposite direction.

, Open the parallel side rails, spreading them apart as far as they will go without resistance.


As you open the side rails, each set of legs will also open. The side rails will remain parallel to one another, but the legs in each set will open into an ""X"" position.

, Once you have opened the side rails and the legs, you should tip the cot over so that it now stands on its legs instead of resting on its side.


The cot should stand without any difficulty, but the canvas will not be taut. Do not attempt to use the cot at this point.

, Firmly sit on the canvas between the first and second sets of legs, then slide down the cot and firmly sit between the second and third sets.


If you have never put the cot together before, the canvas will be difficult to maneuver. Sitting on the canvas stretches it out. It is recommended that you do this before finishing the frame to make the remaining part of the procedure easier.
Note that you should be careful while doing this, however, since the cot can collapse at this point if too much weight is applied.

, Walk around the perimeter of the cot while firmly pressing into the canvas with closed fists.


Press down across the entire perimeter of the canvas. Punch the canvas down the entire lengthwise center, as well.
You can do this instead of or in addition to sitting on the canvas. Either way, this action should help stretch the material and make it easier to maneuver.

, Look for the gaps at either end of the canvas. Slide one of the metal support rails into one of these gaps, then slide the other metal support rail into the other gap.For the time being, the long flat sides of the support rails should rest on top of the metal frame of the cot.

, Snap one of supporting end rails onto the knobs of both side rails.


There should be a plastic or metal knob at both ends of each side rail. There should also be two holes along one side of each support rail.
Slide the support rail down past the end of the side rails. Line up the holes of the support rail so that they are directly in front of the knobs on both side rails.
Firmly push the support rail toward the side rails until the holds snap on over the knobs. If done properly, the support rail should now be firmly fixed onto the side rails and should not wiggle or otherwise move around.

, Move to the second support rail and snap one of the holes into the knob of the corresponding side rail.


You should be able to attach one side of the support rail without much difficulty, but you'll probably notice more resistance at this point than the amount you dealt with when attaching the first support rail.

, Pull the loose end of the second support rail over the side rail until it sits just beyond the end of the rail.


The procedure used to secure the other three corners probably won't work for the fourth and final corner. Even if you stretched the canvas out before attaching the support rails, it will usually be too stiff at this point, and that stiffness will prevent you from lifting and locking the end of the support rail onto the side rail knob.
Line up the support rail with the side rail as closely as possibly during this step. If you cannot secure it using brute strength alone, move onto the next step.

, Use a long metal bar to lift the loose end of the second support rail onto the final side rail knob. Once the hole and knob are aligned, snap the fitting together.


An over-sized screwdriver, hammer handle, or pry bar should work for this.
Insert the levering bar into the gap between the loose end of the support bar and side rail. The fabric should be notched in the corner, allowing you to easily pass the levering bar through it.
Continue sliding the levering bar through this gap until it reaches the point at which the leg and side rail meet.
Pull the long end of the lever toward you with one hand while carefully maneuvering the loose end of the support rail. The levering bar should cause the support rail to lift outward, toward you and away from the cot, making it easier for you to slide the end of the support rail into place.
Once the support rail end is properly positioned, you should be able to snap it on as usual.

, If you do not have a levering bar, you can tip the cot over and use your foot to help lever the final corner into place.After attaching the first end bar and one side of the second end bar, stand the cot on the second, partially unattached support rail.
Wedge your foot in between the loose end of the support rail and the corresponding side rail. Put your weight on that foot, holding the support rail down in the process.
Carefully tip the top of the cot back, thereby lifting the loose end of the side rail over the loose end of the second support rail.
Guide the two ends toward each other until they snap together. If there is another person nearby, you may need to ask that person to help guide the corner fittings together and snap them into place as you hold the cot.

, The cot should be fully assembled at this point. Check it by carefully lying down over the length of the canvas.


The canvas should remain taut when you lie down on it and none of the support rails should break free or wiggle around.
If any of the support fittings break free, you will need to lever it back into place.
Once the entire cot feels secure, it should be safe to use.

Organize your campground according to “zones."",
Position your tent wisely.,
Get to know your neighbors.",How to Prepare for a Camping Trip in the Woods," The first thing to do is decide where you’re going to camp. Your options include campgrounds and national and state parks. You can choose to go car camping, in which you drive right up to the campsite with all of your gear, or you can choose to hike to a more remote location, in which case you’ll need to carry all of your gear with you.Whichever option you choose, inquire about the amenities at the site.


Are fires allowed?
Are there grills available?
Will you have access to freshwater?
Will you have access to showers and toilets?
Is campground closed for any holidays?
How many people does the site accommodate?
Is the campsite accessible by car? If not, how much hiking will you have to do to get there?
What sort of wildlife should expect to see?
What sort of emergency services are available?
Will you be able to get a cell-phone signal? Wi-Fi?
Are bear canisters required?
Is the campground at a high altitude? ;
, If camping at a campground or a park, you may need to reserve a spot, especially in the summer months. Fees will vary from campsite to campsite and from park to park. Some parks allow free wilderness camping with few to no amenities. In campsites that charge fees, you should expect to pay for the following:


A per day fee for the campsite. This can be as little as a few dollars and as much as $30, depending on the campsite.
A reservation fee.
A per-person fee for larger groups.
Septic or waste disposal fees.
Fees within the same park can also vary depending on the desirability of the location. The more desirable the location, the more expensive the campsite.

, Choose a tent that’s big enough to accommodate the number of people on your trip. Choose the right kind of tent. A 3-season tent will protect campers from bugs, rain, and light snow and should work for camping during the spring, summer, and fall. You’ll need mountaineering tent for winter camping.Consider using multiple smaller tents, which offer more flexibility in terms of positioning than do larger tents.Keep only a minimal amount of gear in the tent, which will make more room. Or choose a tent with a vestibule., A sleeping bag is standard, but you can add to that an air mattress or a sleeping pad for added comfort.Make sure that your sleeping will be warm enough if the temperature drops at night. You might also consider a cot, which gets you off of the ground.


To help stay warm on cold nights, heat up some water, pour it into a heatproof water bottle, and tuck the warm bottle into your sleeping bag.Combine your tent and your bed. Hammocks are a good option for solo campers or small groups who don’t want to share a tent. That have the benefit of saving space at the campsite and in your pack.If sleeping in a hammock, place a quilt or pad on the bottom and a use another quilt on top., The clothes you bring will largely depend on the weather you’ll experience at the campsite. You should also plan for unexpected weather and activities by bringing along rain gear and a bathing suit. Whatever the forecast, bring a sun hat and hiking boots.In warm weather, bring a pair of pants, a shirt, an undershirt, underwear, and socks. You might also include a light jacket, fleece, or sweater for mornings and evenings when the temperature is cooler.
For cold weather camping, you’ll need to add thermal underwear, a wool hat, gloves, a scarf, and a heavy jacket. Aim for at least three layers: a base layer, a mid layer, and an outer layer.Bear in mind that cold weather will feel colder when you can’t retreat indoors. Dress warmer than you normally would for cold weather.Outfit young campers in brightly colored clothing. Brightly colored clothing helps keep children visible., Cotton is a bad idea for this reason. Instead, go with synthetic fabrics that wick-away moisture.Wool is a good alternative to synthetic fabrics. Merino wool is even better because it’s less itchy., Layers allow you to easily regulate your body temperature.Wear all your clothes to bed. This rule really applies to cold-weather camping. Before crawling into your sleeping bag, put on all (yes, all!) of the clothing you brought with you., Don’t get caught with wet feet.Make sure your boots fit comfortably.

, Fires are banned in some areas. Check the rules of your campsite to avoid a fine. If you’re not allowed to build a fire, you need to bring a camp stove.Build your fire in a clear area.During dry months, use a stove instead of building a fire., Essentials include wood, charcoal, fire starters, newspaper, a fire ring, matches, and a propane stove for cooking.12-14 split logs provide enough fuel to cook dinner and enjoy a fire afterwards. Bring extra wood just in case. You can gift (or sell) any leftover wood to other campers.If you want to gather wood when you reach the campsite, make sure this is the first thing you do. Don’t get stuck in the dark without a fire! Once you’ve collected your wood, organize it into piles according to size and type, from tinder to fire logs.Light dry wood burns faster than hardwood.Keep sand and water near you fire in case you need to put it out quickly.In colder climate, you might need to have a fire going all day.Use rocks around your fire to create a definitive barrier between the fire and everything else., Prepare multiple fire starting options. You can purchase firestarters, or you can make your own. Keep cotton balls smeared in petroleum jelly in a resealable plastic bag. Also try toilet paper rolls filled with dryer lint or fire starter sticks.You can also gather tinder once you arrive at the campsite, but make sure to do this right away.

, Choose shelf stable items. You’ll need about 1-2 pounds of food each day for each person. Bring only what you need, plus an extra meal or two just in case.Try to choose high calorie food that doesn’t weigh too much: cereals, jerky, peanut butter, trail mix, and powdered foods that you mix with water (like mashed potatoes or powdered soup) are all good options.Limit canned goods. Canned goods are shelf stable, but they also weigh a lot. For this reason, tuna in a pouch, rather than a can, is a good option.Avoid foods with long preparation times.If you bring any fresh ingredients like fruits, vegetables, and hard cheeses, eat them first so that they don’t spoil.Bring extra food during cold-weather camping trips. Your body burns more calories to stay warm., Essentials include a skillet, a pot, utensils, cups, and bowls.If you plan on preparing hot meals, bring a camp stove. Live fire cooking, while romantic, is very difficult to master.Cast iron cookware is a popular choice for a reason: it’s sturdy, versatile, and easy to clean.Use a cooler to keep perishable items cold. A block of ice will melt more slowly than cubed ice.Store all of your plates, bowls, cups, and utensils in one bin, which will help keep things organized.Heat pots with the lid on. This saves fuel.Bring garbage bags to for clean up., Stick to one pot recipes and recipes developed specifically for campfire cooking. Keep the recipes simple and bear in mind prep times.Plan meals that share ingredients to minimize prep. Turn baked potatoes into potato hash, or beans into refried beans., Safe yourself some time at the campsite and do any cutting, chopping, slicing, and dicing at home.Portion foods like trail mix into little baggies. This allows you to regulate what you eat and makes the food much easier to store., Drink at least 16 ounces of water a day to stay fully hydrated., Storage options include gallon and 2-gallon jugs, collapsible water carriers, and Igloo-style water coolers (the kind common at little league baseball games).If you’re lucky enough to have a campsite next to a cool running stream, you can put bottled drinks into a mesh laundry bag, secure the end of the bag on the shore of the stream, and keep the drinks cool in the running water., For filtration, there are many options: handheld pump filters, gravity flow filters, squeeze filters, and battery-powered ultraviolet sterilizers. Which filtration system you choose will depend on how much water you need to filter and how much storage space you have.Water treatment drops, the kind used in developing countries, are another option.You should boil your water too, for extra safety., Make sure that you alert trusted friends and family to both your intended whereabouts and your planned departure and return dates. In the event of an emergency, this will make it much easier to get and the rest of the camping party to safety. You should also supply them with any other relevant information about the trip, including the following:Directions
Potential alternate routes
Cell phone numbers for the members of your party
Vehicle description and license plate numbers
Hand-held radio channel and codes
Phone numbers for the relevant local authorities (i.e. the State Police, the Game & Fish Commission, the Sheriff’s Dept, etc.)

, Talk to park rangers and campers who’ve been to that destination. Study guide books to learn more about the terrain and weather. To avoid getting lost, learn some basic navigation skills like using a map and compass. Encourage the members of your party to pay attention to landmarks.Plan your hiking time wisely. If hiking with kids, hike during the morning and evening, when it’s cooler. Kids are not yet equipped for dealing with excessive heat., Store-bought first-aid kits are no match the kit you can put together yourself. Bring a first-aid kit that includes the following items:Bandages of all kinds: adhesive, butterfly, roller, and elastic (Band-Aids)
Sterile gauze pads
A hot/cold pack
A cold compress
Splinting materials. You can learn how to make a splint at a first-aid class.
Large wound dressings
Blister dressings (moleskin)
Nonadhesive dressings
Cloth-based adhesive tape
A thermometer
Non-latex gloves
A large plastic bag (for hazardous waste)
Safety pins
Scissors
Tweezers and needles (to remove splinters or ticks)
Topical antibiotic cream (Neosporin)
Oral antihistamine (Benadryl)
Pain relievers (acetaminophen or ibuprofen)
Sunscreen
Sun-burn lotion
Poison-ivy cream/cleanser
Burn cream
Hydrocortisone cream (1%)
Alcohol pads
Hydrogen peroxide
A liquid antiseptic soap to clean wounds
Bug repellant
A bee-sting kit
A snake-bite kit
Any personal medications
Feminine hygiene products
A first-aid book.

, Ticks carry Lyme disease, which can cause fever, headache, and fatigue and lead to more serious illness.Wear tall socks. Tuck your pants into your socks and boots. Avoid areas with high grass.Check for ticks often and remove as soon as you spot. Check the scalp, behind ears, under arms, and in the groin area. A bull's-eye rash can be a sign of Lyme disease.To remove a tick, use tweezers. Avoid crushing the tick as you do so. Wash your hands and the affected area thoroughly., Carry bug repellant to ward off mosquitoes, wasps, and yellow jackets. , Bears do not usually attack humans. If you happen to encounter a bear, the first thing to do is stay calm. Not all bears are alike, however.


If you encounter a black bear, be loud and aggressive to scare it away. Use stick, rocks, and pepper spray to fight back, if necessary. If you encounter a grizzly bear, avoid sudden movements and eye contact. Do not run away. Walk away slowly, if possible. If the bear charges you, stand you ground and use pepper spray. If the bear attacks you, curl up in the fetal position and play dead. , You should know what poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac look like and do your best to avoid these plants. If exposed, wash the infected area and use calamine lotion or hydrocortisone cream or take an oral antihistamine to help alleviate the itchy rash., Follow the rules.
If no bear canisters are available, you can bag your food and suspend it from a tree limb.Never bring food into your tent., Keep in mind the weight of what you’ll carry. How much walking and hiking will you have to do before you arrive at the campsite? Are you going to be able to carry such a heavy load to and from the site?Don’t wait until the last minute to pack or you’re likely to forget something and stress yourself out before you even get to the campsite.Consult one of the many available camping equipment online checklists to make sure you’re bringing everything you need. At the very least, you’ll need the following:


Your shelter, including extra stakes
Your sleeping bag and pad, including a pump, if needed
Your fire-building supplies
Your cooking equipment
Your food
Water
Your first-aid kit
Clothes, including rain gear, and bedding
An emergency blanket
Miscellaneous tools, including a multi tool, a flashlight, a hammer, an axe, binoculars, maps, batteries, and a watch.
A solar-powered battery charger like the Guide 10 by Goal Zero to keep your cell phone battery charged in case of emergencies.

, You will choose the pack based on size, which is itself determined by how long you plan to camp. Packs are measured in liters. Choose a 60-80 liter pack for a 2-5 day excursion., Compression bags are a great way to save space. Use them to pack your clothes, your bedding, and your pillows., Designate one zone for sleeping, one zone for relaxing, one zone for cooking, and one zone for first-aid., Choose level ground, preferably close to water. Stay away from dead trees, which can fall and crush you. Lots of limbs and branches on the ground are a good indication of dead trees.At campsites accessible by car on campgrounds, watch out for broken, glass, needles, and other hazardous waste.At more remote campsites, stay away from nests and bushes with berries, which might attract bears.Use a compass to determine the direction of sunrise and sunset and maximize your enjoyment of the outdoors. Remember that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west.Bring an old rug, which can make the site more comfortable and help keep dirt out of the tent., And be neighborly. Don’t be too loud or disorderly and try to avoid loud, disorderly neighbors. A good neighbor can make your camping experience much more enjoyable and can be a welcome resource in an emergency.

Find out where you are going, how long, what you will be staying in, etc.,
Three months before your camping trip, do a full inventory of your camping supplies.,
Think about what you have to bring and what you want to bring.,
Think about how much luggage is appropriate.,
Make a list of things to bring!,
Go over your list.,
Outdoor camping supplies can be broken up into 3 parts.,
The most important thing to remember about outdoor camping is to pack smart.,
You need to know what weather you will be facing.,
While camping you find yourself hiking to your camp site.,
When packing for a car camping trip, remember to pack the tents and/or tarps last.",How to Pack for a Camping Trip," For example: You are going to the Lake for 2 weeks, you will be staying in a cabin, you get your own room, the climate is very warm, it isn't too far from home, and they have lots of recreation halls and a teen club that is open every day.

, Check for items that may no longer be good. Also things you needed last time. Write down things you still need, this way you got three months to collect or save for anything else.

, You could bring several bathing suits, summer clothing such as Capri's, shorts, t-shirts, tank tops. Wear your heaviest or bulkiest item the day of travelling to make more space in your suitcase.

, If you are using a little car and carpooling with about 2 or more other people, don't take up the whole trunk or car for that matter. Take at absolute most 2 suitcases, and 3 bags e.g. hiking bags, back packs. Maybe try packing items such as socks in your shoes.

, (See Things You'll Need for a list of suggestions) Make sure you take enough things but don't overdo it as you may bring too much and not find anything.

, Make sure you didn't forget anything.

, Packing smart, Weather gear, and Travel gear.;
, An example would be putting soft stuff by your back so it's not poking you the whole hike. You need to be prepared but you can't have everything. Another idea is to put stuff in gallon baggies to pack easier.

, If you are facing really cold weather (winter) you need to have this gear:


coat (wind layer)
overalls, hat, balaclava, wicking layer (Under Armor) that would cover from your toes to your neck, warmth layer (in between the wicking layer and wind layer), two pair of socks wicking layer and warmth layer, boots, and (day you are outside) times extra boot liner same with gloves. For summer camping you need to have waterproof shoes, bug spray, sunscreen, and a poncho.

, There are three backpack sizes. The first is a day pack, this is a small pack for short hikes. The second kind is a three day pack, this is a pack that is medium size. The largest pack is a pack that is for more than three days. There are two kinds of packs. The first is an internal frame, and the second is an external frame (day packs are usually frameless).

, This way, the first things you need to unpack once you arrive should be the last things you pack before leaving for your trip.

"
"
Decide with whom you are camping.,
Make sure you get insurance information and health information before you do anything else.,
Set up a first aid kit.,
Decide how long you will stay and figure out where you will be sleeping.,
Pack an appropriate amount of food: Enough for three meals and an optional snack per day.,
Gather all of the other things on the ""Things You'll Need"" list and try to pack them in a small, lightweight bag.,
Don't over pack.

,
Load everything into your car and hit the road!

",How to Prepare for a Camping Trip," If it is just you or your family, the next step is not quite as important. However, if you are taking a scout troop or a group of friends, read the next step carefully.;
, If someone is injured on the trip, the insurance information will make a huge difference in the care they receive. Health information is very important in planning the trip, for example, you cannot pack peanut butter if your friend is allergic to peanuts. If someone who is coming needs routine medication, make sure they have it. If they wear glasses or contacts, make sure they have a case, saline(contacts only)and/or a spare pair of glasses.

, If you are not sure what to put in it, read ""Things You'll Need"". You should also teach yourself general First Aid.

, If you do not know this, you will go through the trouble of purchasing and packing a tent when you were supposed to sleep in a cabin.

, Try not to pack too many perishable food items, like cheese, chicken, and milk. Basically, try to avoid dairy products and meat, because they can make you sick if you eat them when they go bad. Trail mix is great for snacks, fruit for breakfast, crackers for lunch, and leftovers for dinner. Also, remember to pack lots of water.

, You can put smaller items in a backpack or rolling suitcase and the larger items like your sleeping bag can be carried in a garbage bag. They are great for carrying and can be folded and stubbed into a small space until needed.

,,"
"
Decide whom you are going with, and where the campsite will be.,
Bring the right equipment.,
Bring the correct clothing.,
Once you have decided what equipment is needed, plan out what meals you want to have on your camping trip.,
When arriving to the campsite, start by unloading the car at the actual site (if possible) for maximum convenience.,
Leave it the way you left it.,
Talk with everyone about how the camping trip went after the trip.",How to Prepare and Carry out a Successful Camping Trip," After you decide who is all attending to the camping trip, you can decide things like who will provide the transportation, who will be sharing a tent, who can help bring or buy the food/ supplies, and things of that sort.


Deciding where you wants to camp is really up to them, but just make sure everyone agrees on the activities taking place and be sure it is at a designated camping ground. It would be highly advised to call the campsite prior to making the trip to ensure availability, as well as any fees that might be associated with camping there.





;
, Assuming that the camping trip is taking place in the outdoors, there is some essential equipment that you need to bring. The most important item would be the tent to provide shelter (assuming one is not staying in a cabin or other things), the next being the sleeping bag, then the more handy and practical items. Packing can be tedious when trying to fit everything in the car, so make sure you're packing only the things you absolutely need when going camping. (see suggestions at bottom)

, The next essential items to pack are clothing. Depending on what time of year and what the climate is at the campsite will determine what clothes you will need to bring. In warm climates the key is to dress thin to stay cool as possible, and dress in layers in cold weather to keep as warm as possible. Always pack clothing that is resistant to inclement weather, and proper footwear is extremely important. (see bottom for suggestions)

, Cooking meals will depend on what activities are planned, so if a lot of time is being spent at camp you can use a camp stove or the campfire to cook. If not, meals will have to be prepared using items that will take hours or days to perish.

, This will make the set up and preparation much easier. Proceed by setting up means of shelter and food.

, There is a saying that everyone should go by upon leaving a campsite, which is ""Leave No Trace."" Basically, you want to make the campsite look as close to as you found it as possible. This way future campers can enjoy the same luxuries of the outdoors. Pick up any trash found around the camp, an put any unused firewood back in the woods in a spread out manner.

, Discuss things like what went well, what didn’t go very well, what equipment, clothes, or food you could bring next time, and things of that sort.

Select a container for your kit.,
Be prepared to purify water.,
Select cordage to include in your kit.,
Carry a flashlight.,
Bring a knife or multi-tool.,
Prepare a first-aid kit.,
Incorporate a lighter or other fire source.",How to Make a Wilderness Survival Kit1," The size and type of container will vary, depending on where you intend to store it, and how portable you'll need it to be. A sturdy backpack is a popular choice for smaller, highly portable kits. Military surplus packs are popular, since they are designed for rugged use and are often available for less money than purpose-made survival packs. A cooler or other lidded plastic container could also be used. Although they are less portable than a pack or bag, they have the advantage of being waterproof.


If you choose compact enough items, most of the essentials for short-term wilderness survival can fit in a small, waterproof container like an empty coffee can.
If you choose a pack or other non-waterproof container, make sure that any moisture-sensitive items in your kit (matches, electronics, etc.) are stored in their own waterproof containers, such as a zip-lock bag.;
, Clean water for drinking and cooking is perhaps the most important resource to consider in any wilderness survival scenario. Water purification tablets are an effective, and widely available, option. There are different kinds of tablets available, but all work by chemically destroying the microorganisms present in natural water sources, some of which can cause sickness when consumed. Make sure to familiarize yourself with the tablets' instructions beforehand, so you'll know how to use them should you need to. Regardless of the purification method you choose, you will need access to a container to gather and purify water. A simple steel cup, or a lightweight cooking pot will suffice.
Portable water filters are also available. While requiring more work, and taking up more space, than tablets, filters do not add any unpleasant chemical taste to water.
If you are preparing for a wilderness location where water is not easy to find (such as a desert), you should be sure to pack some purified water. Water is heavy, and will make your kit less portable, but it is an essential resource. One gallon of water per person, per day is ideal.

, Few pieces of equipment are more versatile and useful than a simple length of sturdy cord. Most backpackers and survival experts prefer parachute cord, which is relatively lightweight and extremely durable. There are a huge variety of survival applications for cord or rope. Here are just a few:Bundling firewood for easier carrying.
Hanging a blanket or tarp for use as shelter.
Suspending your pack from a tree, out of the reach of bears or other animals.

, A good flashlight is essential for finding your way around at night, and can even be used as a signal in an emergency. It is worth investing in a good-quality model. Cheap, plastic flashlights may break very easily when used in rugged conditions. LED lights are usually preferred. They tend to be more expensive than traditional lights, but they provide a superior level of brightness, durability, and battery life.
Be sure to include extra batteries for your flashlight.
Hand-crank models which do not require batteries are available. Some find them to be a hassle to use, since they must be repeatedly re-cranked during extended use.

, Few things are more useful in a survival scenario than a knife. Knives can be used to shave wood to make tinder, cut chord or rope, prepare fish or game, and even open cans in a pinch. Multi-tools are folding, pocket sized devices which contain a knife, as well as pliers, screwdrivers, and other tools, depending on the model. These are a popular choice, since they provide the benefit of many tools in a small package. Some survival experts prefer a simple fixed-blade (non-folding) knife with a blade around 3"" to a multi-tool, or other folding knife. Fixed-blade knives are more durable than folding tools, but are perhaps less versatile than a folding multi-tool.

, Many fully assembled kits are available for purchase, although it is often more economical to create your own. A basic first aid kit suitable for wilderness survival scenarios should include:Adhesive bandages for superficial cuts.
Antibacterial ointment for treating superficial wounds.
Roller gauze, for dressing deeper cuts and other wounds.
Medical tape for securing the gauze.
A small pair of scissors for cutting gauze and medical tape.
Tweezers for removing splinters or debris from wounds.
A wound disinfectant, such as medical iodine solution, for cleaning wounds.
Sterile cotton applicators or swabs for applying ointment or disinfectant to wounds.
Painkiller tablets, such as acetaminophen.
Allergy medication, and emergency supplies of any prescription medications you may need.

, Even if you know how to light a fire without one, having a lighter makes lighting a fire in an emergency much easier. Make sure to get some practice starting a fire before you venture out into the wilderness.Various kinds of fire strikers are available, which you can use to create sparks to help you start a fire. Be warned, however, that using a fire striker to start a fire can be challenging. If you plan to bring one, make sure you get some practice
You should also consider packing a container of tinder, or fire starting material. Drier lint is a popular choice, since it burns very readily. Old newspaper is another good choice.
While not as convenient as a lighter, wood or cardboard matches require no fuel to light. Look for waterproof camping matches, or store your matches in a waterproof container.

Pack camper with essentials.",How to Prepare a Camper for the First Trip of the Season," It is a good idea to look for damage on the roof and underneath the camper. If anything is damaged, it may need to be repaired or replaced prior to leaving.
, The area of the awning that the door rubs against is the most likely spot for a rip to happen. Small rips can be patched up with tape. If the rip is too large, the awning may need to be replaced. The awning should also extend and retract smoothly with no binding., If there is a spare tire, check that as well. It is a good idea to always have a spare tire if your camper does not.

, Some campers come equipped with an additional outside shower so be sure to check that as well., Connect the positive (red) terminal first then connect the negative (black) terminal. To disconnect the battery, remove the negative terminal first then the positive terminal.

, This can be done by flipping a switch on the monitor panel that is usually located near the rear of the camper.

,, Some campers have built in gauges to do this. If it does not have a built in gauge, just unhook it and lift it up yourself to check.

, Easiest way to check the system is by turning on and off all of the equipment that is connected to the system. These include equipment like lights, plug outlets, air conditioner, microwave, and automatic jacks.

, To check if it works with 120 V, the camper must be plugged in to an outlet. To check if it works with propane, the camper either has a switch to turn and check it or the camper has to be completely unplugged., Some campers come equipped with an additional propane hookup on the outside for outdoor stoves. Be sure to check that as well. This is what the outdoor propane hookup looks like.

, Some campers have an automatic igniter for the hot water tank. If it does not have one, or the automatic igniter is broken, it can be manually ignited., The blackwater tank is where the sewage is stored after being flushed. To prepare the tank, use sanitary chemicals or tablets. These will help reduce odor and promote biological breakdown., A good method for doing this effectively is to put one can on either end in the inside and a third can underneath on the outside., This can be done by using the same method for cleaning a house., The filters are usually located under a sink. Follow the manufacturers recommendation for when to change.

, Unplug camper from wall outlet and plug into vehicle to verify running lights and trailer brakes are functional., These include first aid kit, tool kit, and a road hazard kit. Another item that should be included is extension cords."

Prepare for inclement weather.,
Include a small tent or other portable shelter.,
Pack a wool blanket.,
Store non-perishable food in your kit.,
Add a pot or other cooking container to your kit.,
Take a compass and maps.,
Incorporate additional tools.",How to Make a Wilderness Survival Kit2," What gear you select will depend primarily on the wilderness climate you're concerned about. For instance, if rain is a concern, consider packing a poncho, and ensure that your moisture-sensitive gear is stored in a waterproof container.


If heat and sunburn are concerns, pack sunscreen, a pair of sunglasses, and as much extra drinking water as you can manage.
If you are worried about colder temperatures, packing a spare hat, scarf, and gloves or mittens would be a good idea.
In any survival scenario, packing a change of clothes can be valuable, especially if you become wet. A small bag of spare clothes can also serve as a pillow, should you need one.

, While not a necessity if you do not anticipate needing a kit for longer than a day or two, bringing a shelter of some kind can be a great comfort in the wilderness (especially if it rains). While camping tents offer excellent shelter, they can be quite bulky to pack. Look for compact models designed for backpackers.With a little know how, you can use a tarp, cord or rope, and some structural material such as sticks to make a tent. Since a folded up tarp often takes up far less room than a disassembled tent, this option can save you a lot of space in your kit. Get plenty of practice using the technique beforehand, though.

, Wool blankets are warm, durable, and highly water resistant. While not a necessity in all survival scenarios, having access to a wool blanket can be a great comfort, especially if you find that you must sleep in the wilderness for one or multiple nights.


While many survival experts prefer wool, other options are available. So-called ""space blankets"" are another popular choice. These metallic foil blankets are excellent insulators, and will do a great job keeping you warm.
A compact sleeping bag is another useful addition to a survival kit, although they typically require more room to store than a simple blanket.

, While not as necessary as water for your survival in the short term, having a small supply of non-perishable food can provide you with the energy you may need should you need to spend more than a day or two in the wilderness. Canned food is a popular choice, but dried foods may be a better option, since they are typically much lighter weight. Here are some good options:Meat jerky, or meatless jerky substitute for vegetarians.
Dried fruit.
Nuts or trail mix.
Protein bars.
Pre-prepared, ""just add water"", dried meals are also available.

, While not strictly-speaking necessary, a container in which to boil water or cook food may be useful to you. Boiling water is a good method for disinfecting water, and having access to hot water can make bathing and dealing with cold temperatures easier. If you decide to pack a cooking pot, make sure you will have a way of safely handling it when hot. Metal handles will become very hot over an open fire, and you should be careful not to burn yourself.

, If you know how to read a map and use a compass to navigate, these tools can be invaluable, allowing you to make your way towards safety. Be sure to get plenty of practice with these skills before you enter a wilderness survival situation.


Even without a map, a compass can help you travel in a consistent direction, instead of walking around in circles.

, If you are preparing a large survival kit, such as one intended for storing in a vehicle rather than carried on your person, you might consider packing a couple larger tools, such as a hatchet. Your choice of tools should be informed by what conditions you expect to encounter.


If you expect to need to gather and use firewood, a hatchet or axe might be useful.
Making tent poles from small trees or branches is greatly assisted by having access to a folding saw.
A shovel can assist you in digging fire pits, or preparing flat ground to sleep on.

Look to your friends and family members for reference to any type of camp.,
Be specific on what type of camp you are looking for.,
Most camps are priced around how long you want to stay, which is also something you may want to know BEFORE selecting just any camp.,
Make sure you have the right money for a camp.,
Avoid bringing ELECTRONIC ITEMS.,
Bring as many pieces of lined paper as you can, and a pencil and pencil sharpener, in case you want to write letters to your family back home to express your feelings about camp.,
Make sure you have responsibility.,
Make sure you know who the counselors are.,

Get to know the director of the camp.",How to Pick an Overnight Camp for Kids,";
, Sports Camp? Art Camp? Weight-Loss Camp? Whatever it might be, it's best you decide how you want to spend your summer/winter.

, Whatever suits you just fine is how long you should go. Sometimes it's hard to determine this sort of thing, so here's a quick tip: Try to go on more sleepovers, camp-outs, etc. and see how long you'll last WITHOUT missing your parents. Usually this time period is offered around camp. Let's say you go to a slumber party that last for three days, and you manage to not miss your parents for two. That's offered in camps. If you get a little homesick after only a few hours of arriving, you're not ready to go to camp alone. Consider family packages.

, Planning a good budget ranging from $80 to $200 is good, especially since this is the MAIN price range for camps.

, I am pretty certain that most camps do not allow electronic devices, such as an I-pod, I-pad, cell phone, computer, radio, etc. The only ELECTRONIC item you may bring is a flashlight.

, Some camps have an email system instead, so it's best to check out the camp website and look for they're messaging systems.

, If your a child then you might want to make sure of these things: You need to choose when you shower. It's best to shower DAILY since your outdoors often, and the outdoors odor sometimes can get stuck on you. You'll have to brush your hair, and if you take baths, you need to SHOWER instead. You'll be responsible for making your bed, changing, combing your hair, etc. You'll be responsible for not LOSING your items before leaving camp. Are you ready for this?

, It's not very likely you'll have a counselor that you/your child won't like because most counselors are hired for FRIENDLINESS and a HELPFUL PERSONALITY. Most camp websites give you the email to your counselor just in case you want to touch base with them.

, Be prepared for bullying if there happens to be a 'queen/king kid' of the camp. Prepare to look to counselors for help is someone is ever bullying you. If you think that the counselors can't do anything, your very WRONG. Counselors have the ability to kick the child out of camp, sending them home until next year.

, If your a shy person who really can't handle meeting new people for an entire week or day, then maybe you'd like to come with one of your friends to camp. It's much more helpful to know somebody there.

, Make sure you understand EVERY SINGLE DETAIL of who will be taking care of you/your child. There's some people you just can't trust which makes the camp UNLIKELY to be your destination.

Finalize plans if a majority of the class is interested in going, and begin preparing for the camping trip.,
Leave early on the day of the trip to allow extra travel time.,
Take attendance.,
Enjoy your trip!",How to Organize a School Camping Trip," National parks are a great location for your trip, as rangers can lead tours with your class and host educational activities. If there isn't a national park within a few hours' drive of your school, look for a local campground with recreational facilities, or even consider camping out on school grounds. While it may detract from the wildlife experience, it's convenient and beats not going at all.;
, While students can bring personal supplies (sleeping bags, toiletries, etc.) you'll need to provide essentials like tents, lanterns, First Aid kits, food, of course, and the like. Make sure to arrange van or bus transportation to the campsite well in advance, and once you've figured a date, send home a note detailing the trip and permission forms.


Ask parents to help contribute to the cost of the trip. If their son or daughter is attending, consider requesting for a donation to the cost of supplies. Allow students to bring their own tents (if applicable) to save school finances.

, Begin a nature unit in class and teach about the various wildlife species students may encounter while camping. If you're visiting a national park, have students research information about it, and combine it into a project.

, Make sure all students and supplies are accounted for. If necessary, save space on the bus by taking along one van or small truck specifically for luggage and supplies. Additionally, check the weather before you go. Helpful websites like Weather.com offer 7-day forecasts to prepare you for anything from rain to wildfire threats.

, Once you arrive at the campground, set up camp before embarking on any activities. Take attendance, count supplies, and involve students in pitching the tents. Make sure lanterns have enough battery power to last, and that all food supplies are safely stored or refrigerated.

, Explore the woods, have a scavenger hunt, go searching for wildlife, build a campfire, roast marshmallows, go boating (if possible), have a picnic, etc.

Practice the right amount of turn and throw strength.",How to Throw a Horseshoe," Use a tape measure to measure a stretch of relatively flat ground, at least 30 feet (9.1 meters) in length and preferably 40 ft (12.2 m). This will be your horseshoe court. 40 feet (12.2 m) is the longest distance used in horseshoe throwing, and the most common in tournaments, but if you're playing for fun you can use a shorter distance.


If the court is mainly for children, you might want to use a court as small as 15 ft (4.6 m) long, and consider putting two stakes side by side instead of on opposite ends of the court, to lower the chance of children hitting each other with the thrown horseshoes.;
, Use a mallet to drive two stakes into the ground, one at either end of the court. Tilt them about 12º toward each other, not straight into the ground. For a permanent horseshoe field, use long, iron rods, about 36 inches (91 centimeters) long and 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter. Otherwise, use any long stakes, ideally ones that extend about 15 inches (38 cm) above the ground after they're planted.12º is a tilt approximately 1/8 of the way from vertical to horizontal.

, You can skip this step and start playing immediately, or use these common methods to improve the stability and permanence of your court. If you want to minimize the number of slipping and bouncing horseshoes, you can dig a small pit of moist sand or moist blue clay around each stake. To keep the stakes firmly in position, bury a wooden log below the surface and drill an angled hole for the stake., Typically, the game is played by two players or two teams, with one side standing at each stake and throwing at the other. In tournament play, adult men throw from behind a line drawn 37 ft (11.3 m) from the target stake, while women, people 18 and under, and people 70 and older may choose to throw from 27 ft (8.2 m) instead.If you're playing for fun, however, feel free to draw the lines as close as you need to so the players have a decent chance to throw a horseshoe near the target.

, Horseshoes are heavy and dangerous when thrown. Before throwing, always make sure everyone is standing at least 10 ft (3 m) from the court, and knows that a game of horseshoes is beginning.

, The first player throws two horseshoes, one at a time, trying to get them as near to the stake as possible. He then moves back away from the court, before the second player begins throwing.


Throwing techniques are described in detail below.

, The second player steps up to the stake with his opponent's horseshoes lying near it. She aims at the opposite stake, throwing two horseshoes.


In a team game, the players on each team take turns throwing a pair of horseshoes for their team.

, In one common scoring system, each player gets 1 point for a horseshoe within 6 inches (15 cm) of the stake, and 3 points for each ""ringer,"" with the arms of the horseshoe encircling the stake. Play until someone wins by reaching 20, 40, or 50 points, or any number you decide in advance.Alternatively, use the more competitive ""cancellation"" scoring system. Award 1 point each round to the player whose horseshoe is nearest to its stake, or 2 points if a single player throws both horseshoes closer than his opponent's. Ringers still award 3 points, but if both players throw a ringer in the same round, neither player receives points for it.
Optionally, you can award 2 points instead of 1 for horseshoes that lean against the stake (""leaners"").

, This is the most popular grip among professional horseshoe players, thrown with the goal of rotating the horseshoe sideways 1¼ turns in the air, before it lands encircling the stake.Hold the horseshoe flat in front of you, with the arms, or ""shanks,"" pointing to your left. Grip the horseshoe with your thumb on top of the closest shank. Keep your index and middle fingers underneath the shank, curling up onto the inner edge. Stretch your pinky finger out and press it against the horseshoe to balance your hold. The ring finger can be placed next to the middle or pinky fingers, depending on which grip you find more comfortable and steady.If you are left-handed, hold the horseshoe pointed to the right instead.
Individual grips vary widely. Start with your thumb near the center of the nearest shank, then try adjusting it nearer or further from the bend to see which placement feels comfortable and accurate while throwing.Don't curve your finger around the U-bend of the horseshoe. As the famous player Roy Smith wrote in 1946, ""that went out of style with the horse and buggy"" and makes it difficult to control your throw., This grip is similar to the 1¼ grip, but the horseshoe's shanks are pointing to your right instead. Place your fingers and thumb around the bend of the horseshoe, instead of a shank. This grip uses different muscles to throw the horseshoe, which makes it more comfortable for some people, and less comfortable for others. Try to throw it with just enough strength and height so it turns sideways with a ¾ turn in the air, so it can encircle the stake from the front.

, In this throw, the horseshoe spins ""head over heels"" instead of remaining flat during its flight. There are many variations of this grip, so feel free to experiment. It might be easiest to start by gripping the shoe at the center of the bend, with your thumb either on the top or bottom.


This throw is often considered less accurate from the 37 ft (4.5 m) distance, but there are many experts who have had success with it. It may actually be more effective than the grips above when throwing from shorter distances., Don't grip the shoe so tight that your wrist feels strained, but do keep it firm enough that the horseshoe doesn't slip out of your grasp too early.Use a lighter horseshoe to practice if your hand feels sore or painful.

, If you are right-handed, stand to the left of the stake. Stand straight but relaxed, or slightly slouched if you find it more comfortable.Keep your shoulders squared in front of the stake you are aiming for.


If you are left-handed, stand to the right of the stake.

, Pull the shoulder and arm holding the horseshoe back, in line with your body. Move your left foot forward as you throw.Keep your arm straight, with as little wrist movement as possible, or it will be difficult to control your throw. The rotation of the horseshoe can be produced just by letting the shoe slide in your grip slightly as you swing your armSome players start a short distance behind the throwing line, and take a step or two forward before they throw. This technique may provide more throwing strength, but can take some practice to use accurately.

, Release the horseshoe when it is at roughly eye level in front of you. Prevent jerky movements and weak throws by following through, keeping your throwing arm moving up above your head after release., Well-thrown horseshoes typically fly about 7-10 ft (2.1–3 m) high, then drop down near the stake at a 30–45º angle.If your stake is surrounded by sand or gravel, as many backyard stakes are, a lower, more forceful throw can land in front of the stake and slide onto it. This can develop bad habits if you plan to play in tournaments, which use clay instead of sand, but it's a fine strategy for casual players to use.


A slight ""wobble"" in the horseshoe as it flies will help it land correctly, if you are using a ""turn"" throw instead of a ""flip"" throw. Try adjusting the position of your thumb to alter the amount of wobble., It can take some practice to figure out a grip that feels right, and to learn how hard to throw the shoe. Practice the release time and amount of turn in your horseshoe until you can consistently land the horseshoe in front of the stake, with its shanks facing the stake. Once the right amount of rotation and throw strength is unconscious, you can keep practicing your throws for accuracy and attempting to make ringers more often.


Painting your horseshoes may make them easier to watch in the air, which can help you practice your turn. Videotaping the horseshoe's flight is another option.

Wear a PFD.,
Know your equipment.,
Know your rider.,
Use a spotter.,
Be aware of water regulations.,
Drive Responsibly.,
Use a secure tow line.,
Check before you start.,
Handle wakes with care.,
Exercise caution when pulling more than one tube.",How to Water Tube Safely," While it’s always a good idea to wear a PFD (personal flotation device) when onboard the boat, it should go without saying that you should always wear a life jacket when water tubing. This is especially important in the event that the rider should become separated from the boat.;
, Be familiar with the capabilities of your water sports tubing equipment. It’s important to follow the manufacturer’s recommendations for water tubing capacity in terms of size and weight, number of riders, age limits, and maximum towing speed.

, It’s important to use common sense when it comes to the capability of your rider, especially when water sports tubing with small children. While sharp turns, high speeds, and big waves can be fun, these should never come at the expense of rider safety.

, Designate one person onboard as a “spotter” who can keep a lookout for water tubing accidents or see if anyone has fallen off the tube while the boat driver concentrates on oncoming obstacles.

, Make sure you are familiar with the specific regulations governing the body of water you’re boat tubing on. Pay particular attention to towing speeds.

, While enjoying a day of water tubing, the driver should be alert, sober, and have a solid grasp of boating rules and regulations. Be respectful of and keep your distance from other boats in the area when water tubing and always keep an eye out for additional water hazards such as rocks, docks, and buoys.

, It’s important when water tubing to always make sure that the tow line is securely tied before take off. Also be sure to check for signs of wear, tear, and fraying, and replace as needed. Be sure to only use rope that is specifically designated for towing inflatables.

, Never start the boat without first making sure that your rider is ready to go. This means that they have a firm grip on the line, are properly positioned on the tube, and that the line is properly and safely positioned. When water tubing with multiple passengers, riders should understand how to balance their weight correctly and work together to safely stay on the tube.

, Slow the boat speed when crossing wakes. Bouncing off wakes at extremely high speeds has been known to cause back injury, especially with riders who are water tubing stomach down.

, It’s especially important to travel at slower speeds and keep an extra careful eye out if you are boat tubing with more than one tube. Dual water sports tubing can often result in large crashes and serious accidents should the tubes happen to collide.

Wear a life jacket and use a spotter.,
Figure out if you are goofy or regular footed.,
Use a shorter rope.,
Use a beginner wakeboarding stance.,
Grasp the rope handle in both hands tightly and wait until the driver has driven far enough to eliminate slack from the rope or the person controlling the rope from the boat is ready.

,
Position your lower body as you would while sitting in a chair.,
Signal to the driver or the person controlling the machine that you are ready to be pulled up.

,
Hold on to the rope and keep the board edge above the water as the boat accelerates.

,
Let the boat or machine pull you up and when your body is completely out of the water, begin to straighten your legs.

,
Gently guide the board in turning to point at the back of the boat or the end of the line of the rope.

,
Lean slightly on your back foot to keep the front edge of the board from going under the water.

",How to Wakeboard As a Beginner," A basic boating safety tip for all water sports is to make sure there is a designated spotter to help alert the driver to your position at all times and keep an eye out for other approaching boats or objects in the water.;
, Before you go out on the water for the first time, one of the most basic wakeboarding tips to remember is to decide which foot you want to face forward. The foot you choose should be the foot you always intuitively place forward, whether it’s because you’re about to kick a ball or you’re regaining your balance.

, Another helpful beginner wakeboarding tip is to use a shorter rope that makes it easier for beginners to get up and out of the water. Our recommended length is somewhere between 30 and 50 feet.

, Using a beginner wakeboarding stance will make the board easier to control and navigate. The easiest stance for beginner wakeboarding is to place the back binding far back towards the end of the board and align it at zero degrees, so that the rider’s weight is able to press directly on top of the rear fin. The front binding should be at about a 15-27 degree angle, slightly pointed towards the front of the wakeboard.

,, The front edge of the wakeboard should be perpendicular to the rope and just above the surface of the water. Your knees should be between your elbows.

Pull your paddle into the raft and brace yourself when going over a bump.",How to White Water Raft1," While you may initially want to sit on the inside of the raft, this will actually increase your chances of getting thrown overboard.Instead, sit on the outside rim of the raft and use the cross tubes or foot cones to plant your feet inside of the raft. If your raft has foot cones, place your foot closest to the inside of the raft under it. If your raft has cross tubes, sometimes referred to as a thwart, you can place one foot under them to help stabilize you. Your other foot should be wedged under the outside tube for stability.Sitting in the middle position will minimize your chances of getting thrown overboard.
Do not push your feet too deeply into the cross tubes or foot comes, or they may become caught if your raft flips over.
Those sitting in the front will get to see the most downriver but must also have skills to steer the raft for the rest of the group.;
, An improper grip on the paddle while your raft goes downstream could be a safety hazard for others around you. One hand should be placed firmly on the shaft of the paddle while your other hand should be at the end, covering the ""T"" grip.The ""T"" grip can cause injuries to the face and body of other rowers if it flys out of your hand.
Practice alternating with both hands to see what feels most comfortable for you.

, Using only your arms will tire you out quickly. Instead of using your arms alone, lean into the stroke as you paddle and use your body weight to lean back. Synchronizing your paddling with others will give you more control over your raft. You should also lean into the stroke when you perform a backstroke. To perform a backstroke, lean forwards and pull your paddle backward as you use your leg to anchor you.Paddle hard while you go down the rapids to help stabilize you in the raft.
Those in the raft should try to synchronize their paddles with the people in the front.The paddle in the water creates a resistance that makes another bracing point for you, which is the reason why increases your stability., Often an instructor or experienced white water rafter will yell ""bump"" if your raft is about to go over a hard object such as a rock. In this case, you should pull your paddle out of the water and lean in towards the center of the raft.Place the ""T"" grip on your paddle on the ground and maintain your grip on it as you go over the rough spot.

Create the perfect playlist.,
Play some games.,
Dress to impress at the tailgate.,
Have the right types of drinks at your tailgate party.,
Consider food and whether you're going to cook.",How to Tailgate at a Country Concert," The first and possibly the most important factor to a great country tailgate party is having an awesome playlist. Seeing as you are surrounded by music lovers, you want to make sure you get them dancing and singing before the concert even starts.


Begin creating your perfect playlist three to five days before your tailgate. Send out a group text to all your friends that you plan on tailgating with asking them what kind of music they want to hear that day. Ask them for a minimum of five song suggestions. Take all of those suggestions and add them into your playlist.
Make sure that you have enough songs on your playlist to make it through the tailgate without a song repeating. Consider it an epic tailgate fail if the same ten songs repeat over and over again for two hours. If you plan on tailgating for two hours create a playlist one hundred and fifty minutes long. This is to ensure a quality listening experience to fellow tailgaters. This way, your friends are guaranteed to hear something that they can sing and dance along to during the duration of the tailgate party.
The perfect formula to a country tailgate playlist is listed below.

Start off with a classic song such as ""Sweet Home Alabama,"" by Lynard Skynar
Followed by a friend's suggestion
Add in a popular song found on ""The Top 40""
Followed by one of your personal favorites
Repeat

;
, What's a country music tailgate party without a few games? A bust! Make sure that you pack the classic tailgate games such as corn hole, kanjam, flip cup, beer pong, etc. Take into consideration three major factors when planning the games you will play at the tailgate party. How many people are you tailgating with? How much room do you have in your vehicle for game equipment? How much space will you have at your tailgate to play your games?


For example, if you're tailgating with twelve people and have three cars you have plenty of people, vehicle space, and lot space to bring a variety of different games. On the other hand of you're only tailgating with three people in one car your space both in your vehicle and in your lot will be limited. You always want to be considerate to neighboring tailgaters. Do not invade other tailgater’s space without asking. Either get creative with your own space or make friends with your neighbors.
Do not be pushy. Most tailgaters at country concerts have the same goal and will be willing to share some space if they can join in with the festivities. When playing games, make sure that you’re a good sport.  Someone who gets too competitive during a tailgate party becomes a quick annoyance and buzz kill.

, Old concert shirts, flannels, cowboy boots, fringe, rhinestones; it all works! Wear what you feel comfortable and confident in. Part of the fun at a country concert tailgate is getting to dress in country attire. Sassy lyrics on shirts such as ""Mama tried"" or ""Bound by wild desire"" are fun and classic. Past concert shirts are great conversation starters. It's also important to dress for different weather conditions. Bring a sweatshirt in case it gets chilly at night and buy a cheap poncho from any convenience store in case of rain.


Always consider your comfort when dressing for a tailgate party. New boots are cute but the blisters you will have the next day are not.  If you're confident in what you’re wearing as well as prepared for all weather conditions you will most certainly heighten your tailgate experience.

, If you are dancing to great music and playing games, you are sure to get thirsty.


For drinks make sure to have a balance of non-alcoholic and alcoholic drinks. One rule of thumb is to make sure you always have at the least one case of bottled water. Country concerts tend to be in the summer. You do not want anyone to get dehydrated and not be able to make it into the concert. You will also need a few two liters of pop for your mixed drinks.
Things may get tricky when it comes to alcohol. The best way to make sure everyone is drinking their preferred drink is to make your tailgate party “BYOB” or “bring your own beer.” Individuals are responsible for the amount and type of alcohol that they want to consume at the tailgate. Make sure everyone knows to bring their own coolers; this will save the hassle of someone’s drinks getting mixed up and taken.  
It’s smart to have a cork screw, and bottle opener in your vehicle just in case someone forgets to bring one. If you plan on drinking mixed drinks you should bring a tumbler glass with you. Seeing as most tailgates are outdoors you want to avoid any bugs getting into your drink. 

, If you plan on grilling at your tailgate, bring a small portable grill. A smaller grill will take up less room on your lot and is perfect for grilling simple items such as hotdogs, hamburgers, and sausages.  If you plan to grill don’t forget your condiments. Keep them in your cooler.


If this seems to be too much of a hassle you can bring trays of pizzas or subs to share at the tailgate. Sometimes this is easier because it creates less of a mess.  Make sure if you are supplying the major food staple that the other tailgates bring snacks such as chips, dips, fruit plates, and other items to munch on through the tailgate.

Get the proper safety equipment.,
Follow the instructions given by your raft guide.,
Do not raft alone or in the dark.",How to White Water Raft2," Essential equipment for riding the rapids include a helmet, personal flotation device, the correct sized paddles, a throw bag or rope, and a first aid kit.Getting these essential items can keep you safe on your adventure and are required by most guides and instructors.

, If you are new to white water rafting, you'll likely have an instructor that can give you the preliminary information to stay safe. More importantly, they will likely set the pace and yell out instructions as your raft goes down the rapids. Follow the instructions exactly as the raft instructor lays out and try to stay calm if it gets bumpy.The instructor will often point into the direction where they want the raft to go. This is called ""positive pointing."", Rafting alone or in the dark can be incredibly dangerous and should always be avoided. If you are new to white water rafting, experienced rafters will be able to help you and answer questions as you go. White water rafting in the dark is incredibly dangerous because you can't see where someone is if they get thrown overboard, and you also can't see potential obstructions like rocks in the distance."
"
Do not panic.,
Make your way to the side of the raft.,
Grab onto the outside safety line on the perimeter of the raft.,
Get pulled into the raft.,
Assume the Whitewater swimming position if you're too far away.",How to White Water Raft3," The initial bodily reaction to being dunked under cold water in a high-stress situation like being thrown overboard from your raft is shock and panic. This disrupts your breathing pattern and clouds your judgment which could make it harder to get back onto your raft.Stay calm and aim to reach the surface of the water. Once you do that, you can better assess how to move forward and get yourself out of harm's way.


Try to regulate your breathing and stay concentrated on the task at hand, which is getting back onto the boat, not the fact you've been thrown overboard.

, Once you reach the surface of the water and can breathe, take a second to gather yourself and determine where the raft is. Many times when you're thrown overboard, you'll end up right next to the raft. If you are further from the raft, then you can extend your paddle to the boat and try to get someone else to pull you closer to it.When extending your paddle, make sure you offer the ""T"" grip to the person pulling you in.

, Grab onto the line that's attached to the perimeter of the raft to give yourself stabilization. If you still have your paddle, hand it to someone inside of the raft so that you can grab onto the raft with both hands. Hang on the side of the raft until someone is ready to pull you in.

, Only one person should be performing a rescue if another person gets thrown overboard. If you are the rescuer, grab onto the shoulder straps of the person's personal flotation device, locking both of your arms and then falling back to pull in the individual who fell overboard.The guide should be the one pulling people out of the water.

, If you can't make your way back to the raft and it's impossible for someone to pull you back in, assume the Whitewater swimming position and ride the current until you can get to shore. The Whitewater swimming position is when your feet are pointed out in front of you over the water while you float down the river on your back. Your knees should be slightly bent so that you can absorb any shock from oncoming rocks or shallow areas of the river. When you are going downstream in this position, try to take breaths when the water is low, not on the crest of the wave.Do not try to stand in the water because your feet and ankles can become stuck in rocks and cause serious injury.
Abandon the Whitewater swimming position when you get safely to shore or can make your way back onto the raft.

Make sure that the difficulty of the rapids matches your skill level.,
Search for reputable rafting instructors and companies.,
Choose a trip that will fit your budget and schedule.",How to White Water Raft4," There are six classes of rapid, and each class has a varying level of difficulty. Level one and two rapids are usually suitable for beginners, while the later levels require a guide or experienced rafter. Consider the age, experience, and physical fitness of those that are going rafting and select a difficulty level that can accommodate everyone who is going.


Class two rapids can have three-foot tall waves with wide channels.
Class three rapids have four-foot tall waves and narrower passages than class two rapids.
Class four rapids have consistently turbulent waters, narrow passages, and requires precise maneuvering.
Class five and six rapids are much more difficult and dangerous and should only be attempted by experienced white water rafters., Before you plan your trip, find a reputable and well-rated company that offers white water rafting guides and equipment. Read past reviews of people who have used the company and find a company that has favorable reviews.


If you are new and don't have a raft, many companies have ones that you can rent out for the day.
In addition to the equipment, they will also go over safety procedures and will give you a guide to help you while you're on the rapids.
White water rafting guides should have should have CPR and First Aid certification. Ask the company if these are necessary skills for their guides.

, Narrow down your selections for trips and choose one that you can afford. Search their website to see the seasons that they offer white water rafting. In addition, you'll want to make sure that it fits within your schedule. White water rafting can take three to six hours, so it's smart to allocate an entire day to it.The average cost of a one-day guided white water rafting trip is $25-$115 per person."

A very easy and inexpensive way to catch shrimp or prawns, is to use a very fine butterfly net and scrape along a pipe that may stick out of the water and near a dock.,
If all else fails try using a cheap butterfly net and scraping along the sides of piers or docks and through the sand.

,
You might catch something interesting.

",How to Catch Shrimp," If you've never thrown a cast net, go to youtube.com and watch a video on how to throw a cast net. The best place to practice is your own backyard because the grass will actually show you how your throw would end up in the water.;
, Look for the low-tide times on the tide chart. Low tide is the best time to shrimp. Dusk to evening at low-tide is optimum.

, Banks, piers, docks or by boat are great places. You want to find a place that is no deeper than the radius of your cast net.

, When the lead weights reach the bottom, use the rope and pull in the net. As you pull on the rope, the horn of the cast net will close in the circle of the net trapping what's inside.

, When pulling your cast net up from the water, remember you were just dragging this net through the mud. Pull the cast net up quickly (but not too fast). Buy a wide-brimmed bucket to put your net in.

Be safe.,
Take pictures.,
Enjoy.",How to Sea Walk," Any kind of water place is fine. This place can be a beach, lake, ocean, pond, swamp, or any other water-land that has enough room to walk along. Make sure this place is appropriate. For example, if you want a place that will show the sunset at night, go to a beach. If you want a place that has crickets chirping at any time of day, go to a swamp. Find a place local to you that meets your requirements.


Make sure that this place isn't private property of anyone's.;
, It is very important to bring a person because if you fall into the sea, you want help. Make sure you know this person, and you feel comfortable around them. You might want to bring a person that you know well, so you can start up a conversation if you get bored of walking.


Bring a cell phone, and make sure the person coming does as well.

, This way, you know that you don't circle around and around and around all night, and you know where you are. This is helpful especially when you are jogging, because you know how far you've ran.


Try marking your starting point somewhere near civilization, so that people can see that you've gone walking if you ever get lost.

, Definitely bring a cell phone, but if you want to, you can bring a picnic basket full of food, for example. Bring a towel and a change of clothes, and all the other things you'd probably want to keep handy (bug spray, rain boots, etc.).

, Find a reason to go walking on the sea. Maybe you like the smell of the ocean, maybe you want to add more shells to your collection. Whatever it is, try to find a reason to get out of the house and walk by the sea.

, On the sea, there are some really cool things to find. You could find a coral shell, or an amazing flower.


Look out for sea-glass. Sea-glass can be really cool to collect, but make sure it's actually sea-glass and that it is not to sharp.
Whatever you find, use your best judgment to take it or not. If you find a time capsule that says, ""Don't open till 2084"", don't take it. Some shells and rocks are okay.

, Bring the right safety materials, like a cell phone, a flashlight, etc. Make sure you are going with a person, and don't walk too near to the sea. These may sound like too many rules, but you'd rather be safe then sorry.


Make sure you go at the right time of day. Don't go at one in the morning, but you could probably go at ten o' clock if you're careful.
Bring a watch.

, Don't bring too expensive of a camera, in case you break it or lose it. But there can be some beautiful things you see along the way. A picture of a bird or a flower can be awesome memories at times.

, Relax. Take your mind off everything else and stare out at the ocean. Have fun and do it often.

Set the drag at 9-10 pounds for the strike.",How to Catch Striped Bass," Having a boat equipped with a reliable fish-finder will certainly help in your pursuit of big striped bass.


Having a firm understanding of how to operate your fish-finder will aid you in locating a productive area in which striped bass have gathered. Therefore it is recommended that you read the owner's manual thoroughly before using.
Striped bass can be unpredictable -- they can be found at different locations and different depths depending on the weather, time of year and even the time of day. Using your fish-finder will help you to determine the depth at which the bass are holding, which will allow you to present the bait at that exact depth and give you the best chance of actually catching a striped bass.;
, Striped Bass are opportunistic feeders who may be caught using a wide range of bait.


Live bait such as herring, menhaden, mackerel, eels, squid, clams, anchovies, bloodworms, shad, nightcrawlers and sandworms all make great bait for striped bass fishing. You can find these baits at just about any local fishing bait and tackle shop.The type of bait that will bring you the most success will depend on the location you intend to fish in. If you're unfamiliar with the body of water you'll be fishing, consult with a local bait and tackle shop to find out what type of bait they recommend.
You can also catch striped bass using a lure that resembles the forage base in the area where you'll be fishing. These lures can be made from plastic, wood, metal, resins or rubber.

, You should be able to catch striped bass with almost any rod and reel, provided it's heavier than a light spinning outfit.


The type of rod you use will depend on type of fishing you intend to do. Will you be fishing in freshwater or saltwater? Will you be fishing on a boat? Or will you be fishing from the surf or on a jetty, bridge or pier? Will you be chunking bait, or using a lure? The answers to these questions will determine the correct weight, size and flexibility for your rod.The type of reel you use is arguably more important than the rod -- a saltwater spinning reel is a good option, as long as it's sturdy enough to pull in a 20 to 25 pound fish.
In terms of line, you should be using a 10 to 20 pound test monofilament line (though some people prefer heavier lines for catching bigger fish). The hook should be nice and sharp and there should be a minimum of half an inch between the point and the shank, to avoid catching undersized bass., Although striped bass can be caught all year round, in almost any condition, you can increase your chances of successful fishing if you understand the striper's behavior patterns.


Striped bass are migratory fish who prefer water temperatures between 45 and 65 degrees F. Therefore, if the water temperature goes above or below this range, you are unlikely to find any striped bass, as they will have migrated to warmer or cooler waters.
The temperature may also affect the location of the fish within the water. On a hot sunny day, the striped bass may dive to depths as low as 40 feet (12.2 m) to avoid the heat and find more suitable temperature and oxygen levels. Whereas, on a cooler day, you might find them just a foot or two below the water's surface.
Stripers are more prone to feeding when there is water movement due to changing tides or a strong breeze. This is due to the fact that water movement stirs up sediment, which attracts bait fish (who feed on the sediment). In turn, the feeding bait fish attract the stripers.
Striped bass tend to feed most actively at dusk and dawn, where they can hunt smaller fish under the cover of darkness. Therefore, you may have a higher rate of success if you fish at these times.

, Fishing live eels is an exciting and effective ways of landing big striped bass up to and above the 40 pound mark. On Cape Cod Bay in particular, live eels account for many big striped bass each spring, summer and fall.


Live eels can be used to fish for bass in deep water. They can help you to catch larger fish, as the biggest striper fish tend to lurk near the bottom.
Live eels can be fished many different ways. One of the most popular and easiest methods is to fish live eels on light spinning setups.

, Place the eels in a cooler with a plastic ice block and a damp burlap sack.


This keeps the eels moist and cool. The ice also has the advantage of slowing down the eel's metabolism, which makes them easier to handle.
Don't submerge the eels in water, as they will deplete the oxygen levels and eventually drown., When fishing from a boat, use your sonar to first locate an area where striped bass have congregated.


When cruising at a higher speeds, striped bass will appear as small orange blotches on most sonar screens. It's easy to miss these marks so be sure to keep a keen eye on the sonar.
Depending on the wind and tide, setup a drift that will bring the boat through the area in which striped bass have gathered.

, Eels are slithering, squirming creatures, so they can be difficult to handle and hook.


Use a burlap sack or even a cotton sock to hold the eel, as this will give you a better grip. Hold the eel around it's neck in order to hook it. Use circle hooks to avoid gut hooking bass.
Hook the eel in one of two ways -- either pass the hook through the top of the eel's mouth and out one of its eyes, or place the hook as deeply into the eel's mouth as possible and pass it through the bottom of its throat.
The former method hooks the eel more securely but runs the risk of accidentally killing it, which the latter method is less secure but keeps the eel alive for longer and makes the hook appear less obvious.

, When casting your eel out, go easily at first until you find the sweet spot -- you don't want to rip out the hook.


Give the eel a few seconds to reach the bottom -- depending on the strength of the current and depth of the water -- before you start to slowly reel it in. You may need to add up to 1/2 ounce of weight in the form of a rubber core sinker if the tide and wind is particularly strong.
Start reeling at a very slow rate of 3 to 5 seconds per revolution -- you want the eel to do most of the work for you.

, As soon as you feel the bass grab the eel, bow the fishing rod til it's parallel with the water.


This will prevent the striper from feeling the tension in the eel and becoming spooked. Next, you can do one of two things:
You can set the hook as soon as the line goes taut and reel the fish in immediately, or you can allow the fish to run for 5 to 10 seconds (keeping the line slack) before setting hook.
The second option gives the fish more time to take the bait, but also increases the chances of hooking too deeply, which could damage a fish that you intend to release., One of the easiest and most effective ways for new striper fishermen (and fisher-women!) to catch keeper-size striped bass is to learn how to troll the tube and worm.


When trolled slowly, the colored tube imitates a large sandworm or a swimming eel -- two of the striped bass's favorite delicacies.
This method works best when fishing in shallow, flat waters, with temperatures above 55 °F (13 °C).

, This is very important, as tubes fished without bait rarely catch bass.


The fresh bait helps to give the tube an inviting scent, which will encourage the striped bass to come closer and investigate.
Never fish with old or spoiled bait -- the stripers will ignore it and you'll end up hooking a sand shark or skate instead.
Consider adding a stinger hook to the tube to help prevent short strikes and lost bass

, A speed of 2–2.5 mph (3.2–4.0 km/h) is the most effective for trolling the tube.


This mimics the natural swimming speed of an eel in the water, making the bait seem more realistic.
It may feel very slow, but be patient -- catching a large striper bass is worth it!

, Tube and worm trolling works best in water 3 to 7 feet (0.9 to 2.1 m) in depth, though it's possible to fish as deep as 20 feet (6.1 m).


Let the line out slowly, keeping it taut, until you feel the rig bouncing off the bottom. Reel the line in one or two turns, to keep the rig just above the bottom.
The amount of colors of lead core trolled behind the boat can help you to determine the depth at which the tube and worm is being trolled. For example, if bass are holding at 15 feet (4.6 m), then 3 colors (5 feet/color) is used to reach the bass.
Try to slowly weave the tube forward and back on opposite 45 degree angles -- this helps the movement of the bait to appear more natural.

, Keep the boat moving forward in the initial moments after a strike in order to achieve a good hook set.

Use simple, light tackle.,
Use a small hook.,
Use worms and small insects for bait.,
Try artificial bait around dense areas.",How to Catch Sunfish1," You don’t need anything special or fancy to catch sunfish. Cane poles, fiberglass poles, flycasting tackle, and ultralight spinning tackle can all be used to fish for sunfish. A 4-pound line and small hook is also good for catching sunfish.You may also attach a float and sinker weight.;
, Sunfish are typically small fish. You won’t catch a sunfish with a large hook because it will be too large for their mouth to close around it. To ensure that you catch your fish, use a small hook.Hook sizes number six to ten work well.

, Sunfish are not picky and will bite just about anything. The easiest and most common types of bait used to catch sunfish are crickets, earthworms, red wigglers, and grubs. Though you can use dead or thawed bait, live bait is better.You can also use other species of worms or even balls of bread.
When using worms, only use part of the worm because you only need a small amount on the hook. Too much of the worm on the hook can make it difficult to catch the fish. They may nibble part of the worm and avoid the hook.

, When you are fishing around brush, weeds, or rocks, you shouldn’t use live bait. Instead, use small flies or other artificial bait. You can also try small spinners, spinnerbaits, and jig-spinners.Sunfish are usually caught on small lures because they are small fish with small mouths.

Search the shallows.,
Chum the water if necessary.,
Bait and set your trap.,
Collect your catch.",How to Catch Shiners1," Concentrate on shaded areas around docks, overhanging trees, and vegetation. Avoid very dense vegetation, which will make spotting fish more difficult. Look for active shiners zipping along just below the surface of the water.Find a strategic area to set your trap., Lure the shiners out of dense vegetation and deeper waters. Tear bread into fairly large chunks that are big enough for several shiners to feed on at once, which will help reveal how many are in the immediate area., Use bread or crackers to lure shiners inside. Place the trap in shallow water. If the current's strong, anchor it with a few rocks inside or secure it by tying a line., Wait for shiners to collect inside. Then, if possible, keep your trap partially submerged in the water when you open it to remove your shiners; this way your fish will remain relatively stress-free. Transfer them to storage as quickly as possible so they remain as healthy as possible.

As the line drifts, the angler slowly reels in his line to get ready to repeat the process. This kind of fishing is most commonly done in a river with a current upon which your bait can drift.Cast your line and bait at 30 - 45° upriver and allow your it to ride the current of the river. When your bait reaches an angle of approximately 30 - 45°, you should reel in your line and prepare to cast again.
You should weight your fishing setup so that it bounces along the bottom of the river touching at intervals of about a foot.
Generally, you should equip yourself with an 8½ - 9 foot rod.
You should fish for Chinook salmon 20 - 25 lb line.
Pink salmon can be effectively fished for with a 10 - 15 lb line.;
, This style is comparable to drift fishing, with the exception that instead of casting your line over a wide swatch of river, you instead cast into a migratory path or area known to hold salmon. Once your gear is cast, you should wait for the fish to strike, or reel in your line to change your setup.Your mainline should be rated between 40 - 60 lbs and tied directly to your lure.
Your leader will attach your weight to your setup. It should be tested for 15 lbs, and should be from 18"" - 30"" long. You will likely need between 1 and 8 ounces of lead to attain the best depth., Float fishing, also referred to as bobber fishing, is a somewhat new fishing strategy used by American salmon fishermen. The basic rigging that you should use for your float fishing setup should include 12 lb test line, a bobber, a bobber stop, a bead (usually included with your bobber stop), a barrel swivel, and a lure.These parts can be found at most sporting goods or fishing supply stores.

, This requires tying your bobber to your line and then fastening your bobber stop, which must be done according to the style of bobber stop you have purchased. Some use rubber bands, others can be knotted into the mainline, but after you have affixed your stop:Thread the bead that came with your stop, or any other bead that fits your line without slipping over your bobber stop or being large enough to get catch your bobber.
Slide your bobber onto the mainline, tie a size 7 barrel swivel into your line, and add weight recommended for your lure to your leader line, a thinner, 18-24 in length of line beneath your swivel.Keep in mind that salmon prefer darker areas; you will likely want enough weight on your rig to place your lure at an appropriately dark depth.
Float fishing is ideal for rivers small or medium in size, with moderate deepness and medium to medium-fast current., Trolling is a kind of boat fishing where you periodically move your boat up and downstream instead of anchoring in one spot. This can be beneficial when catching salmon since salmon tend to move with the current of a river or stream rather than staying stationary. Within trolling, there are three main types of boating technique: motor mooching, diver trolling, and down rigger trolling., Motor mooching is where you troll in a boat using the same kind of sinker as drift moochers, called a mooching sinker or banana sinker. Many fishermen will troll for salmon with plug cut herring lure or a small spoon similar in shape, changing the speed of the engine to vary depth, speed, and the action of the bait., Divers have long been a part of the fishing world. A diver is an attachment that can be added to your mainline, which causes your line to cut beneath the surface of the water as a function of your boat speed and current speed.With a diver, there is no need for a sinker to achieve your fishing depth, and when a fish bites, its extra weight should tip the diver down allowing you to reel your catch in without resistance.

, A downrigger is a mechanical attachment that consists of a winch and weight. The weight carries your line and lure down to a specified depth, allowing you to more precisely target the optimal feeding zones of salmon. To set your downrigger:


Reach trolling speed with your boat. Take your rod in hand and release the line to your desired depth and place your rod in the rod holder.
Gather your line from beyond the tip of your rod in one hand and take your line release with your other hand. Take the weight of your downrigger (also called a cannonball) out of the water and attach the line to the line release.
Return the weight to the water and take the downrigger reel handle firmly in hand. Loosen the clutch (usually found on the right side of the downrigger) to release the locking mechanism on your weight.
Monitor the line counter (usually recorded in feet) and set it to your desired depth, tightening the clutch when you've reached your depth.
Apply your drag clicker and reel in your line until there is a slight bowing in your rod. If you feel a fish on the line, you should take you rod from the holder and lift to activate the line release.
Once you've reeled your catch, retrieve your weight by loosing the clutch and reeling up your downrigger crank until it surfaces., Spinners are a kind of lure that have metal blades that spin while the lure is moving through the water. This causes the lure to catch the light, creating a flash similar to the scales of a real fish in addition to giving more realistic movement to your lure. Spinners have four basic designs:Standard inline, where the blades of your spinner will revolve around a straight wire.

Spinnerbaits, which have a design closer to that of an open safety pin and will come with lead molded to the lower arm and the spinning part attached to an upper arm.

Buzzbaits have a special propeller shaped spinner to raise your bait to the surface. This is likely not an ideal lure for salmon fishing.

Live bait spinners position the spinner in front of hooks intended for live bait, like night crawlers or minnows., These are considered to be a staple for bank anglers.In addition, these lures can add some buoyancy to your setup, which can help with snags.Size zero is recommended for spring Chinook salmon, as these fish are quite large, and spin-and-glow lures are effective for boat fishing, though some fishers report having better luck with spin-and-glow lures from shore., These are a specific brand of lure, currently very popular among Chinook salmon fishers for sizes ranging from K14 - K16.Many anglers wrap Kwikfish lures with a sardine to increase effectiveness. This can be accomplished by:


Cutting a rectangular piece of meat from a bait sardine and attaching the meat to the bottom of the lure. You should be sure that the skin of your bait goes against your lure.
You should consider changing your wraps regularly; some veteran anglers recommend doing so approximately ever 45 minutes, though your bait should hold up, with reduced effectiveness, for as many as 3 hours., ""Plug-cut"" is a kind of bait preparation that has the head sliced off. Herring, in particular the plug-cut, is considered the tried-and-true lure of preference for lower Columbia, CA, for salmon fishing, though success is also reported with whole herring.Some recommend you leave entrails in your plug-cut herring to give it a better scent and potency while being used as bait., Because of the fact that salmon have such a thick jaw, the sharper you keep your hooks, the better your chances of getting a salmon on the line. It is recommended that you keep your hooks razor sharp for best results.You'll need a hook sharpener to achieve best results, which you should be able to purchase at most sporting goods stores.
Pull the hook sharpener across the point of your hook, keeping the sharpener parallel to the shank. With quick strokes to each side of the hook, your hook should be sharpened.
Test the sharpness of your hook by drawing your hook across the nail of your thumb at 45-degrees. If the hook sticks to your nail and doesn't slide across, it is sufficiently sharp., Not up in the clouds but below them, as salmon prefer low-level light. Overcast days are going to offer the best success for your fishing efforts. Dawn and dusk are also times that salmon are quite active, and if you are fishing for salmon, these conditions might improve your final catch count.If the sun comes out when you are out salmon fishing, don't give up hope! Since salmon prefer lower light conditions, targeting deeper, darker water, like the shadowed areas around sandbars, can still yield results., Live bait can also give you a strong advantage in your search for salmon, but better yet is roe (fish eggs).Many sporting goods stores will sell this kind of bait cured, which will work well for you fishing endeavors.


You can also harvest and cure your own roe, if you're feeling adventurous, or even use artificial lures. Many fishing aficionados recommend spinning lures, called ""spinners."", You'll need a permit to fish just about anywhere, but you might not know that in addition to your permit, you'll likely need a special stamp or an additional permit to fish for salmon legally.This will protect you from being fined, and potentially having your equipment seized or incarcerated, when you are salmon fishing.


The permit/stamp fee you pay is important not only to the continued general health of the aquatic ecosystem, but also for stocking and conservation programs.

, Although you probably won’t forget your fishing pole, you might forget something small yet important such as your fishing license. To prevent this from happening, you should make a checklist. A sample checklist might look like:


Compass
First aid kit
Fishing license
Insect repellent
Map (of fishing location)
Measuring tape (to check size restrictions)
Needle nose pliers
Pole
Poncho (or other rain gear)
Sun protection
Tackle box (with extra line, fish stringers, bobbers, hooks, jigs, leaders, lures, sinkers, weights)
Water (bottled recommended)

, Choosing the wrong stream, water system, or lake could be the difference between a great catch and no chance of catching salmon at all. Salmon follow specific ""runs"" when migrating. You should look up runs, hatchery locations, dams, and approximate spawning locations for best results. Some useful sights that might help you with this include:


Maps of hatcheries and dams in the Pacific Northwest:http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/salmon-running-the-gauntlet-hatcheries-and-dams-of-the-pacific-northwest-map/6561/

Maps for inland trout and salmon:http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-153-10364_63235-211883--,00.html

List of recreational salmon fishing areas:http://wdfw.wa.gov/fishing/salmon/whenwhere/area.html


, Your local natural resources or fish and wildlife office tracks salmon migration and regularly posts these numbers online for the purposes of conservation and management. Use this information as a guide or ask a local fishing veteran which way the salmon run.

, Remember your salmon research! These fish prefer overcast days and waters close to 55° Farenheit. If the weather is against you and you find yourself fishing in bright weather, you should choose a bright lure to fish with. Darker weather can benefit from darker lures.

, Maybe you plan on starting with bank fishing and then meeting up with friends to troll fish by boat later in the day. Certain lures work better for certain techniques, and you may also need specific equipment to switch up your style. It'll be difficult for you to go float fishing if you don't have a bobber!

, Expert anglers recommend fishing for salmon early in the morning, dusk, or evening hours. It's true, you can catch salmon at any time of day, but salmon are generally more active during these times., A holding area is a spot along the migration route where salmon slow down or stop before continuing upstream. These areas are ideal to fish for salmon, because the fish will be plentiful and they will all be focused on eating instead of migrating.Salmon are attracted to bright colors, so use lures and bait that will catch the attention of the fish and make them want to bite. Master anglers recommend red, blue, fluorescent pink and fluorescent orange as colors that will most often attract salmon.

Keep alert on the trail.,
Stay about 50 feet behind a horse.,
Get the rider’s attention and ask to pass.,
Ask the rider if you should dismount and walk your bike.,
Give a wide berth if you pass a horse.,
Always assume that a horse may be scared by bicycles.",How to Yield to a Horse on a Multi Use Trail1," When approaching a bend on a trail, be wary of potential horses around the bend. Slow down while going round corners, as you should try to avoid coming up on a horse unaware.


If you’re on a trail commonly used by horses, do not use your bell, as this can spook a horse!;
, If you’re riding a bike and you come up behind a horse on the trail, stay about 50 feet behind, and slow your bike. This will prevent you from coming up on the horse too quickly.


The rider will appreciate the distance and the opportunity to keep their horse calm.

, Before you pass a horse on a trail—whether you’re approaching from ahead or from behind—you should make sure that the rider knows you are present.Politely ask the rider if you can pass them on your bike. Try calling out. Say something like,


“Hi! I’m approaching on a bike. Is it OK if I come past you?”
“Will it spook your horse if I come past on my bike?”
In some cases, the rider may not trust their horse to stand still for you to pass. If this is the case, the rider may move ahead quickly, or move far off of the trail so you can pass.
If a horse is coming up behind you, the rider will most likely call out to you as they are approaching. Even if the rider does not greet you, still plan to move off to the side of the trail and allow the horse to pass.

, Some horses are very afraid of bicycles, and both horse and rider will feel more comfortable if you walk your bike instead of quickly riding by.


If you see a horse approaching from ahead of you on the trail, make eye contact with the rider, slow down, pull over to the side of the trail (or completely off the trail if its narrow), and ask the rider if you should stop while they pass., Do not ride immediately next to a horse. Even a horse not typically frightened by bicycles will get spooked if you ride right next to it.


If the trail is on an incline, the cyclist should always step off on the downhill side., Even if you are personally familiar with horses, or if you have already passed many horses on a certain trail, a new horse could react completely differently.


Different horses have different comfort levels with riders and hikers, but assume they are easily spooked and always be careful around them.
Some horses are scared by things they have not seen before. If you are wearing a helmet or large backpack, you may need to remove it, so as not to spook the horse."

Try lakes and rivers.,
Fish during the day.,
Fish in shallow water with cover.",How to Catch Sunfish2," Sunfish can be found around the United States in most lakes, ponds, and rivers. One isn’t necessarily better than the other for catching sunfish. Many people prefer to lake fish, but rivers can yield some great catches, too.Fish around different bodies of water in your area to figure out where you can find the most sunfish.

, Most sunfish are more active during the day than at night. They also feed by sight and get curious about things they see in the water, and they can see in the water more easily during the day. For the best chances at catching sunfish, fish while the sun is out.During the summer, morning and evening fishing is most effective. During the fall, fish in the middle of the day.

, Sunfish can be found just about anywhere, but they tend to really like shallow areas that have some kind of cover. Look for sunfish around brush, weeds, and rocks.For example, lake coves are a common place to find sunfish.
In the winter, you can also find sunfish in deeper waters.

"

Place the bait under a cork.,
Fish without a cork in clean areas.,
Drift across the lake in a boat.,
Wait about five minutes after you cast.,
Hook the fish.",How to Catch Sunfish3," Sunfish don’t like to chase their food. Try placing the bait on a hook under a cork. Make sure the float is small because if the cork is too large and heavy, the sunfish will detect it and avoid the bait. Keep the line still because they like motionless bait.Put one to three feet between the cork and the hook. Try different depths if you are having trouble catching anything.

, Your line doesn’t have to have a cork if the bottom of the body of water doesn’t have a lot of cover. You can let the hook sink to the bottom of a gravel or sandy bottom, especially when you are bed fishing in early spring or after a cold snap.After a few minutes, recast the line.
Make sure that you use light weight so the bait can fall to the bottom slowly.

, Another way to catch sunfish, especially in late summer when they are more readily found in open water, is to drift the bait through the water with a boat. The hook should be suspended around 10 to 15 feet down into the water. Drift across the lake, dragging the bait through the water.You may want to try drifting in areas where you know fish have been before.

, If the line doesn’t tug or the bobber move by then, reel in about a foot and repeat the process. Try a different bait and cast again. Then, cast in a different place.


If there are no bites where you cast and you use the right bait, then there may not be any hungry fish in the area.

, When the sunfish bites, you will see ripples and the cork might go under then up over the water with a loud plop. Don’t move your rod. This is difficult and infuriating, but the fish is probably just nibbling and smelling the bait.When they bite, the bobber will go under and to the side. Jerk your rod up lightly in the opposite direction of the bobber to set the hook. If the bobber moves to one side but not down, then the sunfish hasn’t bitten the hook.

Take safety precautions.,
Use new batteries.,
Prepare your foil.,
Prepare a transfer source.,
Find the positive and negative ends of the battery.,
Attach the foil.",How to Make a Lighter1," Safety is obviously important when dealing with fire, but you’re also dealing with electrical charges and batteries, which contain dangerous ingredients.


Wear gloves. Although there aren’t many safety measures available in prison to make the infamous lighter from “Orange Is the New Black,” you’ll want to take safety precautions and protect your hands.
Keep a fire extinguisher and garbage receptacle ready. If you need to dispose of batteries, be sure to recycle them. Some municipalities and states, like California, require batteries to be recycled, and your community might have battery collection procedures.
Dispose of the battery immediately if it starts to leak. This could be battery acid, which is dangerous and corrosive.;
, You don’t want a leaky battery. Plus, you’ll need a charge to generate the flame. Most batteries will work, but a AA alkaline battery is common for this type of lighter and a good size.Use two batteries if possible, or a single 9 volt, because one AA battery might not provide enough power., You need metal foil to make this lighter. If you don’t have kitchen aluminum foil available, you can use a gum wrapper or foil from a cigarette lighter, for example.








If you’re using a AA battery, try folding over the foil once and making a strip about a centimeter wide and three inches long. This way, it forms a small bridge over the battery when each end is connected.
Make the metal strip small enough to heat up easily, but not so small that it quickly burns up or breaks apart.You might have to play with the size and the shape of the metal strip to see what works best.

, This type of flame will start quickly and burn out quickly. So, have a flammable source on hand to transfer the fire, if you want to keep the flame going.


Sheets of loose paper, newspaper, or dry leaves will work well here.
It is important to transfer the fire and not let the battery itself light on fire, since it could explode.

, On most batteries, this should be clearly marked. On a AA battery and other cylindrical batteries, the positive (+) end or terminal—known as the cathode—has a small convex bump, while the negative (-) end or terminal—known as the anode—has the inverse: a small concave indent into which the bump can fit.

, When you’re ready to light a flame, attach one end of the foil to the negative side of the battery. Then, carefully attach the other end of the foil to the positive end, and voila! Fire!

Bring at least one partner.,
Search the shallows.,
Hold the net upright.,
Designate one person to stick close to shore.,
Designate the second person to wade out into the water.,
Collect the shiners.",How to Catch Shiners2," Using a seine net is a two-person job at minimum.To make collecting the fish at the end even easier, bring a third partner or more. Make sure everyone’s fine with getting wet, since you’ll all be in the water.

, Find a place close to shore where the riverbed is fairly uniform and even. Stick to the shallows, in water low enough to keep your waist clear while wading. Avoid heavy currents that may knock you off balance or scatter fish.

, Have one person hold either end. Spread out until the net is fully extended between the two of you. If your net has lead weights and/or floats, make sure the weights run along the bottom and the floats along the top., Have them stand in shallow water only a few strides out from dry land. Be sure they have enough distance on either side of them for the net to remain fully extended when parallel to the shoreline. Instruct this person to stand in place., Keeping the net tight and fully extended, have them drag the net through the water in a 180º sweep around the first person, who remains close to shore, fixed in place, as a pivot. Be sure the bottom of the net drags along the riverbed so no shiners escape underneath it. Trap the shiners between the net and the shoreline as the second person returns toward land., Cut off any possible exit by bringing both ends of the net onto dry land or closer to it. If you’ve brought a third partner along, have them scoop the shiners out of the water with a teardrop net. If there’s only two of you, bring the seine net’s two ends close enough together for one person to hold each while the other scoops the shiners out of the water.

Pick a spot to cast.,
Cast your net.,
Close the net.,
Land your shiners.",How to Catch Shiners3," Keep clear of dense vegetation or any objects that may snag or otherwise interfere with your net. Search the shallows for active shiners, or scan the surface of deeper waters for bubbles, boils, and other signs of activity just below the surface.Chum deeper waters with bread bits. Continue to chum for around 15 minutes before casting in order to attract as many shiners as possible.When casting in shallow water, use a smaller-sized net, around 5’ in diameter., Throw it so that it spreads out on its own before it lands on the water. Practice your technique before using your net to fish.Multiple techniques exist, but one of the simplest is to:


Coil the throw-line in your favored hand. Then, with your other hand, hold the net up, fully extended, with the weights resting on the ground. Next, clutch the net in your favored hand at waist-height.Raise your favored hand. Hold the net up as though you were showing off your bicep. With your free hand, pinch one edge of the net’s weighted bottom between your thumb and index finger, picking a spot directly below your raised hand’s thumb.Extend your favored arm. Hold it straight out to your side. Draw your other arm up to the center of your chest, allowing the bottom of the net to open by a quarter.Face the target area. Rotate your body backward by 90º on your favored side. Then rotate back to your original position, casting your net high as you swing through, while keeping hold of the throw-line., Allow the weights to sink in the water for a few seconds, then pull the rope tight to close the net. Be sure to close the net before the weights reach the water’s bed. Avoid tangling the net in objects resting on the bottom., Haul the net in by its rope, hand-over-fist. Once you hoist your catch out of the water, open the net and transfer the fish to storage. Move quickly to keep your catch as healthy as possible.

Pick a spot to fish.,
Bait your hook.,
Reel your catch in.,
Land your shiner.",How to Catch Shiners4," Search shallow, shaded water for active shiners.Avoid dense vegetation that may foul lines. In deeper water, scan the surface for bubbles, boils, and other disturbances that indicate activity below the surface. If necessary, hum the surface with a small amount of bread to lure shiners out into the open or up from the deep, Use a small treble hook to avoid injuring the fish. Bait the hook with balls of bread. Lower your bait into the water, keeping it on the surface., Once you feel a bite, wait a moment or two to give the shiner a chance to continue feeding in case it hasn’t actually hooked itself yet. Then reel your line back in gently until the line grows tight. Keep your motions smooth and gentle; avoid jerking the rod too violently and losing the shiner before it’s fully hooked., Hoist it out of the water. Keep a firm grip on your shiner as you unhook it so it doesn’t wriggle free. Be careful to not squeeze it so hard that you injure it."
"
Keep your shiners comfortable.,
Maintain water temperature.,
Clean your tank.",How to Catch Shiners5," Once caught, place them immediately into an aerated live-well, a flow-through bait bucket, or a cooler with an aerator.Keep them well oxygenated to avoid loss. Minimize their stress as much as possible so they recuperate quickly and act normally when used as live bait.

, Use an accurate thermometer. Keep water under 60ºF. For short-term, same-day storage, add ice to your cooler or bait bucket if it’s a particularly hot day. For long-term storage, invest in a refrigerated, insulated tank or a water circulation system to minimize losses., For long-term storage, avoid losses through disease by cleaning your tank regularly. Paint your tank’s interior with pool and tank paints to seal the surface and minimize disease."

Follow general yielding etiquette.,
Pay attention to horses approaching from behind you on the trail.,
Talk to the rider.,
Communicate with members of your own party.,
Stand still while the horse passes.",How to Yield to a Horse on a Multi Use Trail2," Although yielding may change based on the situation, the general rule is that cyclists yield to both hikers and equestrians, while hikers yield only to equestrians.Look for posted signs at the trailhead (or along the trail) that will dictate who should yield to who.
To yield the trail to a horse and rider, either move far to the side of the trail, or step off on the downhill side.

, If a horse—or group of horses—are approaching you from behind, it is the lead rider’s responsibility to call out and alert you. Be courteous, and step off the trail if the rider asks you to.


Even if horses are approaching from behind you, they still have the right-of-way on the trail.

, This will comfort the horse, by letting it know that you are a person, and not some strange object beside the trail. You can also check with the rider to see if the horse is skittish and needs plenty of space to pass, or if it’s comfortable and you can stay on the trail.


Say something like, “Hi. I’m happy to stay off the trail until you pass, but let me know if your horse is comfortable with people and I’ll keep walking.”
When yielding the trail to a horse, stay in full view. You may scare the horse if you step behind a tree or boulder., If you’re hiking as part of a large group, make sure that all members of the group have a similar understanding of trail etiquette.All members of your party should yield simultaneously. If the lead hiker encounters a horse, she should communicate that all members of the hiking group need to step off the trail.

, Once you have stepped off the trail (or to one side, if it’s wide), don’t more around much or make loud sounds (including shouted conversation).Horses can still get spooked by people or things on the side of the trail.


Be courteous to both horse and rider by standing still and relatively quietly.
Once the horse has moved 15-20 feet down the trail, you (and your party, if applicable) can resume your way down the trail.

"
"
Do not expect all hikers and cyclists to yield to you.,
Ask for the right-of-way.,
Control your horse.,
Continue talking to the hiker or cyclist as you pass.",How to Yield to a Horse on a Multi Use Trail3," Although it’s correct trail etiquette for cyclists and foot traffic to yield to horses, novice hikers and bikers may lack the experience to know this.Make sure to engage verbally with other trail users. This way, you will know if they plan to pass you or are going to step off the trail.

, Once you’re in communication with another trail user, if they have not already yielded the trail, politely ask for the right of way. Novice hikers and cyclists may not understand that they need to accommodate your horse and step off the trail. Say something like,


“Hi. my horse might get spooked by seeing a bicycle on the trail. Could you stand off the trail?”
“Would you mind stepping to the side while my horse and I pass?”

, It’s your responsibility to keep your animal under control. Horses are much larger than both hikers and bicycles, and if out of control, can seriously hurt people—including yourself.


If you are riding a young horse or one that is poorly trained, you may need to yield the trail.

, This will reassure your horse. The animal will feel more comfortable when hearing two human voices converse.By talking, you can also learn important information from other trail users. Say something like,
“You may want to stay off the trail for a few minutes. Several other horses are passing this way.”
“How many other hikers/cyclists can I expect to see behind you?”

Insert the paperclip.,
Take two rubber bands and tighten them around the pencil grip.,
Wrap the pencil grip with aluminum foil.,
Secure the foil with rubber bands.,
Light the top interior of the gripper.",How to Make a Lighter2," Use a foam pencil grip that’s about an inch and a half long. You don’t need a particularly ergonomic pencil grip that will bend easily. It should be firm and straight. Form a small foil ball. It should be just large enough to cover the hole at one end of the grip and squeeze securely into the end of the hole.








, The pieces should be about as big as peas. Then, put a thin layer of Vaseline or other petroleum jelly between the pieces. As the petroleum jelly is heated to liquid, it’s fumes become combustible.







, Insert the cotton from the open end of the grip down toward the foil ball at the other end. Add cotton until the foam cylinder is full.








, Use your hands to straighten a paperclip and place it a quarter of the way down the pencil grip on the tin-foil-ball side. You’ll need to squeeze in the paperclip along the wall of the pencil grip, between the grip and the foil ball.








, Use small rubber bands about 3/4 in. or 7/8 in. long (sizes 37 or 8, respectively).Wrap one rubber band about a centimeter below the top and one rubber band about a centimeter below the bottom of the grip. This will secure in place the mechanism you have so far, and get you ready to wrap the grip with foil.








, Use a long strip of aluminum foil about the width of your thumb. Wrap the foil around the circumference of the pencil grip from top to bottom.








, Wrap rubber bands over the foil and around the pencil grip. Take two rubber bands, and wrap one around the top and the other around the bottom of the pencil grip. Leave about a centimeter of space from the rubber band and each end of the grip.








, Now you have your homemade lighter, and you’ll use the cotton balls as wicks to melt and light the petroleum jelly. Hold the lighter by the bottom of the straight paperclip. Use a match to light the other end at the inside top of the pencil grip.

Assess the symptoms of the infection.,
Drink plenty of water, if you are experiencing any of the symptoms above.,
Avoid sexual intercourse.,
Wash your vagina regularly with mild soap and clean water.,
Keep the area dry.,
Wear loose-fitting cotton underwear.,
Treat the infection according to the type of affliction you believe you have.,
Seek a doctor's help as soon as you are out of the wilderness.",How to Treat Vaginal Infections in the Wilderness," There are a number of body parts that can be affected. Each one requires a different treatment, either orally or topically. The following are symptoms to look for if you suspect an infection in the wilderness.


If you are experiencing painful urination, vaginal discharge and vaginal soreness or itching, it is likely that you have vaginitis. This is caused by microbes that upset the normal balance of the fluids in your vagina.
If you are experiencing painful urination, redness outside of the vagina, around the vulva and an itching and burning sensation around the vulva, then it is likely you have had an allergic reaction. Common causes are poison oak or poison ivy. Other causes include prolonged time in the water or on horseback.
If you are experiencing burning urination, blood or cloudy urine, abdominal cramping or odiferous urine, it is likely that you have a urinary tract infection (UTI). This is the tract that leads from your bladder to your urethra.;
, The water will help to flush excess bacteria from your urinary tract and vaginal opening. Drink enough so that your urine is a very pale yellow.


Make sure you are drinking fresh, tap or bottled water. Do not drink from lakes, rivers or streams, as they can add additional bacteria to your body.

, In each of these situations, intercourse will increase the irritation and it may spread microbes to your partner. Do not resume until after the symptoms have been cleared up and/or you have been treated by a doctor.

, Rinse the area thoroughly and dry completely. Do this 2 to 3 times per day.

, Although you will need to urinate more frequently while consuming more water, you should use clean toilet paper to keep the area dry at all times.

, This kind of fiber helps the area to breathe and it dries fairly quickly.

, The following are common treatments that are used before you are able to seek a doctor's attention:


If you believe you have vaginitis, then you should clean the outside and inside of the vagina often. Dry it well with a towel. Use a non-prescription anti-fungal cream, such as Monistat, to treat the infection, if it is available.
If you feel as though you may have had an allergic reaction in the vulva area, avoid further contact with the allergen. Keep the area very clean and dry. Treat with an anti-itch cortisone cream, if you have this in your first aid kit.
If you believe you have a UTI, then you should drink plenty of juice and take or eat vitamin C. Cranberry juice has often been used as a preventative treatment for UTIs. The acid helps to create an unfriendly environment for bacteria to grow.

, Although the body works to fight infections, many infections, especially UTIs, should be treated with a course of antibiotics.
