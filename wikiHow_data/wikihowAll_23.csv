Find a suitable tree.,
Pick a desirable branch or group of branches.,
Inspect your surroundings carefully.,
Split your tree fishing rope approximately in half in length into two sections: the falling, or weight section, and the throwing line.,
Estimate how much margin of error you have.,
To assemble the weight line half, put one end of the rope in your least favored hand, for most this will be their left hand, and bend your elbow.,
Grasping the top portion of the rope with your least favored (usually left) hand, use your other (right) hand to gather the bottom of the loops you have been making with that (right) hand and pull the rope taught.,
Holding the two ends of this large coil apart turn one end a 1/2 turn creating a figure 8, then bring the two halves together so they make one smaller coil, about half the size of the first one.,
At this point, you should have about half of your weight line left, or less.,
Once you have used all but the last foot, draw that last foot through either end of the opening in the coil that was created by winding up the middle of the coil, it will resemble the loop created when you tie your shoe but be made of the many laces of the coil and should be large.,
As the coil hangs there, notice that if you were to pull the free end of the rope tighter the weight would climb towards your hand, and if you slackened the rope it would drop towards the ground.,
With the coil hanging at its best height coil the rest of the throwing rope in loops about the same size as the loop holding the throwing rope.,
You have hopefully selected a dead, dry looking branch that is say, 12 feet (3.7 m) off the ground.,
Face the tree at a 30 angle with your left foot forward.,
Grab the coil and the throwing line you intend to toss with your throwing hand.

,
Hold the remaining rope with your other hand.

,
Swing the coil and weight back and forth to get the heft of it, try to bend your knees a little as you do.

,
To make it without the darn rope falling back on your head you probably need to be far enough back that the tree branch is at in the range of a 30-45 degree angle.,
Swing back and forth until you are ready to let loose, and aim for a spot 10 to 15 feet (3.0 to 4.6 m) above the branch you want.,
If all goes well, the rope will go over the branch and stop, untangle and fall to the ground.,
Gather both ends of the rope and walk backwards slowly away from the tree, pulling gently as you do, testing to see if you do have a dead branch.,
Try not to put to much tension on the rope as you pull the branch down.,
If you find you are working too hard, the branch may still be alive, so move on.,
If you take down more than you need, move the pile away from the campsite or trail you used, leaning it against a fallen trunk if possible, it will make a fine home for a young forest dweller.

,
Practice fire safety and leave your campsite cleaner than when you got there.",How to Use Tree Fishing to Retrieve Deadwood While Camping," If you are trying to remove a dead branch that is a hazard to others this is not an issue, however, if you are seeking ground wood in an area where none is present then you must find a suitable tree. Suitable trees are either dead or have branches that are completely dead. This is easier to identify in leaf-bearing times of year, however, further steps will help you test a branch for suitability. It is much preferred to start with a tree that appears to be completely dead than one that only has a number of dead branches.;
, If a group is selected each one must be harvested one at a time. Live branches are not desirable. First, they will not come down easily. Second, pulling down a live branch opens up the tree to infection and your action risks killing the whole tree. Third, they will not burn properly because live branches are very wet on the inside. The best branches look brittle and dry on the outside, may have some signs of breakage already, and are no more than twice as high as your throwing line is long plus about 10–20 feet (3.0–6.1 m) of rope. You must allow yourself some room for the branch to fall in front of you rather than on top of you. Never attempt to pull a branch directly above you straight down.

, Is there a bee hive in the tree or surrounding tree? Which way do you intend to pull the branch? Is your escape route from the falling branch free from obstacles, holes, divots, bears, campfires, spittoons and other objects that could hurt you?

, The throwing line should be a little more than half the length of the rope, but not much more because the weight end is the end that will fall down to you so that you can pull the dead branch down.

, If you have a long line and a low branch, you don't have to be too careful about the ratio of weight side's length to throwing line's length, but if you are going at a branch at the limit of your total possible range then you might want to determine the exact middle of your line, mark it, and use that as the dividing line between the weight and the throwing line, though in practice, always err a yard or two on the side of the throwing line.

, Then, wind the rope in a continuous circle from your hand down around your elbow and back again until you have used about 1/2 of your weight line allotment of the total line.

, If you have been keeping the rope tight to your elbow as you have been doing this, each of the loops you made should be about the same size. If not and they are falling apart, repeat this step. Eventually it will be second nature.

, (This is why smaller diameter rope is preferred to larger diameter, the rope must be able to be turned and bent at this stage).

, Carefully, without letting the weight coil fall apart, wind the remaining weight portion of the rope around the middle of the coil so that it squeezes the middle of the coil together as if it would be a figure 8 if you twisted it. In fact, there would be nothing wrong with it twisting into a figure 8 during this step, the important thing is that the remaining weight rope go around the middle of the coil leaving space, a loop, at both ends for rope to flow through freely later.

, Pull a good arm's length through the coil and hold it in your less favored (left) hand with the throwing weight now swinging down below it.

, You should find the length at which the coil is at least a foot above the ground, but no more than 24 inches (61.0 cm), at the low point of your swing. That is probably your most comfortable throwing height.

, Bear in mind that you will be throwing 2/3rd's of this rope and letting the rest play out of your hand as the rope rises.

, It is perhaps 10 feet (3.0 m) long and 3 inches (7.6 cm) around and branches at the end have broken off and are hanging down already. One sign that it might be dead. Do not aim as close to the trunk of the tree as possible. That will be the same thing as trying to pull down the whole tree and in many cases, if successful, will be hazardous to your health. Generally the mid-point of the branch is a good place to try for for beginners on a branch that is nearly parallel to the ground, if possible.

, (You will soon have your own technique - lifeguards ignore any throwing instructions, just add lift.)

,,,, Branch heights and rope heights sometimes intervene. Get used to the idea that you will not get it in one toss.

, Hold onto the end once it plays out. If you don't it is entirely possible that the whole thing will sail right over the branch and hit the ground without unravelling the weight. Funny...the first time.

, If the rope does not immediately untangle, try shaking it, making it circle like a jump rope, find a place it might catch against a smaller branch, any place but the corner of the trunk. If it catches there, you might lose your rope, unless you have brought other equipment! In most cases the worst that will happen is that you will miss, in which case you just need to repeat the process.

, If you do, there will be no ""springy"" sensation as you pull back on the branch. If you have picked well you will soon hear some cracking. That is the sound you want to hear. Cracking is an indication of dead wood.

, You do not want it to whiplash out of control in another direction because you have pulled it fast and hard and it broke under too much tension. Generally, pulling back towards the tree is very effective.

, While describing how to make the coil is laborious, making and throwing it is fun.

Pick a spot 200 feet (61.0 m) from your campsite and any water sources, and dig a hole approximately two feet deep, and one foot wide.,
Place a window screen across the top of the hole to filter out food from the water.,
Pour your waste water from washing dishes, cooking, brushing teeth etc, into the hole through the screen.

,
Burn or pack the left over food particles that collect on top of the screen each time you use it.,
Remove the screen at the end of your trip, and fill the hole with the original dirt.",How to Make a Garbage Dump for Your Campsite,";
, If you do not have a screen you can also use a garbage bag, poke holes in it, and then place pine needles or something similar to filter out food.

,, Keeping it out in the open will attract animals to the scent of the food particles.

, Make it look as it was before you got there.

"
"
Survey the land for signs of dried out river beds.,
Dig a few curved holes (the more the better) about 19 inches (50 cm) deep so that the moist subsoil is clearly visible.,
Throw any plants into the hole/holes.

,
Place an open coffee can, mug, cup or canteen in the center of each hole.,
Lay a taut piece of clear plastic wrap across the top of each hole.

,
Create a seal by pouring sand in a circle around each hole along the outside of the plastic wrap.,
Place a small to medium sized rock in the center of the plastic wrap so that the plastic wrap dips to a point above the can.,
Wait for the sun to evaporate water out of the moist soil and any plants within each hole.,
Once the sun dries the subsoil in a hole, just dig another.",How to Make Water in the Desert1," These locations are the best place to seek moisture.;
,


If you are in dryer conditions, the moist subsoil may be slightly deeper. Dig until you find it.
Do not dig the hole/holes in the shade. This process needs direct sunlight to work correctly. Look around and make sure that shade won't move over your solar still before evening arrives.

,,


If you have a length of plastic tubing, you can run it from the bottom of the coffee can out the edge of the hole. You can use the tubing to suck the water from the can without dismantling the still.

,,


Pour the sand 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) from the edge of the plastic wrap. Ensure that there are no gaps. The plastic wrap must seal the hole shut; if it is punctured, the water will not condense.

, Keep the plastic wrap from touching the can or else the water will not drip into the can.

, The water will condense on the plastic wrap because it cannot escape the hole and will drip into the can. If you have installed plastic tubing, drink from that.

, Alternatively, you may dig deeper using the established hole/holes.

"
Cut a piece of 4-inch (10-cm) PVC pipe to the desired length.,
Glue a solid cap to one end of the tubing.

,
Glue a threaded fitting to the other.

,
Tie a length of cord to the screw cap and tether it to the tube.

""Go"" in basket style coffee filters, then place the soiled coffee filter into a plastic bag.,
Empty the contents of the tube into a trash bin when you get to the ground.",How to Make a Poop Tube1," This should be dependent on your own toilet routines and the number of days you will be backcountry. 6 to 10 inches (15.2 to 25.4 cm) is normally good.;
,,,, Place the bagged prize into tube. This is way easier and more sanitary than trying to aim for 4 inch (10.2 cm) tube.

, Then clean and sanitize the tube so you can re-use it on your next big wall.

"
Using 550 paracord (or similar material), tie a clear plastic bag on the end of a plant or small tree branch.,
Make sure the bag is sealed as tightly as possible around the branch.,
Water vapor will collect and condense in the bag.,
Wait until evening for maximum condensation before removing the bag.

,
Switch the bag to another branch and repeat.

,
Expected yield is one cup of water per large bag - you will need several of these to survive.

",How to Make Water in the Desert2," Do not use tape - the heat will prevent the tape from adhering effectively to the bag.

, The plant transpires water during the process of transpiration.

Put the food away in a suitable shelter or container.,
Create a bear hang.,
Handle food with care.,
Avoid cooking strong smelling foods.,
Dispose of all food scraps, food particles, leftovers and containers properly.",How to Make Your Food Bear Safe when Camping," This is the simplest method, provided that the place in which you put your food is secure and bear-proof. Examples of food storage methods that prevent bear access include placing your food:


In metal food lockers. Some campgrounds provide metal food lockers. Use them. If they are full, ask neighboring campers if they can share some space.
In a cabin. Some campgrounds provide cabins with shelves or food lockers and a locked front door. Place all food in here and make sure that the door is firmly closed. Label food if in a shared area.
In a bear-resistant canister. Note that some parks now require the use of bear resistant food containers. If you hike often, a canister can be a worthwhile purchase. They can also often be rented on popular hiking routes if you don't want to buy your own. Place all food into the canister and close completely. Locate your sleeping area away from your cooking and bear canister area, ideally at least 100 yards.;
, If you do not have access to either a shelter or container, a bear hang is the best option in many cases, although be aware that the thinking has changed in many parks to favor bear-resistant canisters because bears have worked out the trick behind bear hangs in many places. If it is still okay to use a bear hang in the area you are camping in, you can make it by:


Selecting a suitable spot between two trees, at least 100 yards (91 meters) from your tent. Do not hang it over berry patches, obvious bear trails etc.
Stretching a rope between two trees that are not too close together. To get the rope up high enough, attach a small rock or other weight at one end to provide the momentum to throw it upwards. The bear hang should be at least 12 feet high (4 meters) and 4 feet (1.4 meters) away from each tree.
Attaching a sealed sack to the middle of the rope.
Pulling the rope up and tying it securely to the other tree.

, For the best bear-deterring actions, obey this list of don'ts:


Cook at least 100 yards (91 meters) from your tent.
Change clothes after cooking and keep those clothes elsewhere from your sleeping area.
Don't ever leave food unattended, not even for moment to go to the stream to get water. Make sure it is guarded by others at the campsite or is put away.
Don't ever take food into the tent. This is crucial or a bear may be tempted to rip open the tent to forage. Check children's backpacks, pockets and other containers to make sure no candy or cookies have been sneaked in or simply forgotten about. It is very easy to overlook strongly scented candies, chewing gum and chocolates without realizing.
Don't eat or cook in your tent.

, Foods with strong odors will be very attractive to bears. Bacon is a well-known bear attractant. Probably whatever food makes you drool at the smell of it is an indicator that it'll attract bears. Be careful in the food choices that you make, especially where heating intensifies the smell.

,


Use bear-proof trash cans.
Wash plates, cookware and utensils at least 100 yards away from the camp and preferably capture all food pieces and dispose of them in the bear-proof trash cans.
Leave a clean campsite. Do not leave uneaten food, food scraps, garbage or empty cans etc. on the campsite. Leave it as clean, if not cleaner, as you found it.

Place the fish on a platter.",How to Cook Fish on a Barbecue," One of the trickiest parts of cooking fish on a barbecue is making sure it doesn't stick. If your grill grate still has bits of the last thing you cooked stuck to it, the fish's delicate skin and flesh will stick to the grate and the fish will fall apart. Clean your grill grate well with a stiff-wired grill brush. After you've scraped off all the bigger chunks of debris, finish the job by wiping off the dust with a dampened paper towel.


If you're dealing with more debris than you can clean off with a wire brush, try this trick: cover the grill grate with a piece of aluminum foil, then light the grill and turn the heat up to full blast (around 550 degrees Fahrenheit). As the debris on the grill gets hot, it will break down and dissolve.;
, This is part two in preventing the fish from sticking. Using oil to lubricate the grill grate makes a huge difference when you have to flip the fish or lift it onto a plate. Fold a paper towel into a square pad, dip it in cooking oil, and coat the grill grate well with oil.


Wipe the grate with oil until the grate is glossy with the stuff. Don't skimp here, since the oil is the best defense you have against your fish sticking to the grill.

, If you put fish on a warm grill, it'll stick, so you want the grill to be very hot. Whether you're using a gas or charcoal barbecue, wait until it's completely heated to start cooking your fish. If you're using a charcoal grill, wait until the charcoal turns grey, which indicates it's nice and hot.

, Heartier species of fish are the best type to grill, since they'll hold up to high heat and won't flake apart when you try to lift them. Look for a thick, steak-like texture and avoid grilling flaky, delicate fish that will simply fall apart when prodded. Here are some great types of fish to barbecue:


Salmon
Tuna
Halibut
Swordfish

, Oil both sides of the fish with olive oil or another cooking oil to keep it from sticking to the grill. A good piece of fresh fish doesn't need much embellishment in the way of flavor, but a sprinkle of salt and pepper will enhance its natural properties.Avoid using a sugar-based marinade, since the sugar will stick to the grill and make it hard to move the fish.
If you want to flavor the fish with additional spices and ingredients, you may want to consider roasting the fish in an aluminum foil packet instead of placing it directly on the barbecue.

, Cooking the skin side first will help the fish hold together. If your fish doesn't have skin, that's fine; just place it on the grill.

, It takes about eight minutes to cook through an inch of fish, so for most fillets this means three to five minutes per side. Watch as the fish's flesh starts to cook and become opaque as the grill heats it from below.

, The best tool to use for the job is a fish spatula, but any other type of metal spatula will do. Flip the fish carefully onto the other side.

, The fish should flake easily when poked with a fork and be opaque all the way through to the center.

, Any type of whole fish does great on a barbecue. Since whole fish are wrapped in foil before cooking, you don't have to worry about finding a fish with firm flesh. Look for a fresh fish with clear eyes and shiny scales with no bruises or discolored spots.


Have the fish cleaned and scaled at the fish counter. The guts and scales will be removed so the fish is ready to go when you get home.
You may want to plan ahead a bit further when you're cooking whole fish. A whole fish takes about three times as long to cook as a fillet.

, This will help the fish cook more evenly by opening the fish up to additional heat. Use a sharp paring knife to make a few slashes perpendicular to the backbone on both sides of the fish.


Make longer, deeper slashes toward the head, where there's more meat and the fish cooks more slowly. The tail area cooks more quickly.

, Rub olive oil all over the fish and sprinkle salt and pepper both inside and out. If you'd like to stuff the inside cavity with additional seasonings and herbs, feel free to do so. Here are a few popular seasoning combinations:


A few slices of lemon and a few sprigs of thyme
Minced garlic with rosemary
Sliced red onion and butter

, Instead of placing it right over the hot coals or fire, place it on a part of the grill that gets indirect heat, so it won't end up burning. The heat should be steady and medium or else the skin could burn before the fish is done. Place the fish so that the tail is furthest from the flames.

, Each side should be cooked eight to ten minutes per inch of thickness. The fish is ready to be flipped when the meat flakes when poked with a fork. When one side is done, flip the fish and continue cooking for another eight to ten minutes.Another way to tell whether once side is sufficiently cooked is by moving the fish slightly with a spatula; if the skin no longer sticks, it's ready.
If the fish sticks, it may not be finished cooking on that side. Give it another few minutes, then work it loose carefully.

, Lift it carefully onto a plate and garnish with lemon slices and herbs. To serve, flake it from the bones and divide into portions, or have your guests serve themselves.

Shoes, not flip-flops, because you will be doing a lot of marching. Your shoes need to be something that can take it, preferably tennis shoes.
Your instrument and your music/lyre and flipbook, if you'll be playing.

If you have two instruments, it's wise to bring the oldest one. Things tend to get thrown/dropped/wet at band camp and you don't want to ruin your high dollar instrument. However, unless the two instruments are exactly the same use the one you plan to perform with to eliminate any wild cards in your scenario.


A water bottle, and a lunch if necessary(You're going to want that water bottle!)

If you're a singer going to a similar camp, pack a ton of water and keep hydrated throughout the day. While brass, woodwind, string and percussion players also definitely need to keep hydrated, singing with dry chords could cause injury.


Sunscreen to prevent burning.
Sunglasses to stop the sun from blocking your eyes, if allowed.
A change of clothes: just something simple like exercise shorts and a t-shirt. You never know if you might slip in the mud, get sweaty, or get uncomfortable.
Deodorant to put on mid-day (at a meal?) if you have longer rehearsals.;
, Since band camp takes place over the summer, you'll want to wear shorts and a light-colored t-shirt or tank top, unless otherwise specified by your band director. Also be aware of the dress codes followed by the band and the school, and if there is any difference between the two. For instance, if the school normally has a rule that you can't wear shorts that aren't at least a certain length, the band may choose to be lenient on this during the summer.

, Timely arrivals show you want to make a commitment to the program and will save your section from having to run laps, or being otherwise reprimanded by your director/drum major. Remember: In band, early is on time, on time is late, and late means running laps. Also, being on time or early gets rehearsal to start (and end) on time. You don't want to be the person that makes rehearsal end later.

, Chances are you haven't played or done a long rehearsal for a while. You may also wish to stretch.

, Ask your section leader or band director if you're not sure about something. Good etiquette helps things flow smoothly and look professional.

, You will probably make faster friends and be respected more if you make a decent effort at marching and playing your instrument. ""When in doubt, play out."" If you're trying to hide that you can't play part of the music or execute a certain move, nobody will be able to help you and when someone finally notices that you've been doing it wrong, you'll have a harder time learning.

, Complaining or bellyaching is extremely annoying and unhelpful.

, Get to know your classmates, your section, whoever is sitting or standing next to you in formation, and anybody else that seems interesting. You have band and music in common already. However, do not talk when you're setting up formations, at attention, or listening to the director talk. You have just joined a family joining this band. It may not seem like it now, but you'll learn to love them!

, Now is the time to practice. Practice as you would like to perform... learn your formations, work, music, rhythms, etc.

, You'll perform better and feel better if you take care of your body. While marching band is technically considered an art, it is more rigorous than many sports.



Stretch. Marching band can be demanding during the summer. You don’t want to pull a muscle or injure yourself. Also, take it easy when you have off time- Even though it's summer, staying outside and running around is sure to wear you out, leaving you with little energy or focus when it's time to get back to work.

Wear sunscreen and a hat if you will be marching in the sun. That sunburn won't feel good tomorrow, and it'll spare you sock tans, glove tans, and drum harness tans (somewhat). Remember to reapply every 2 hours or so. Wear chapstick that protects against the sun. Sunburned lips are not fun to play an instrument with, especially for brass players. Also be sure to wear shoes that don't come off in the mud if you know your school's fields are muddy during the summer.

Drink plenty of water. This means water or Gatorade/Powerade (see Warnings). Soda and juice will dehydrate you. Be sure to drink a full glass of water 20-30 min before you go out into the heat. Avoid drinking milk or eating dairy products just before camp. The heat will not cause it to curdle, your stomach will stay at a constant temperature unless you get heat stroke and the acid in your stomach always curdles milk anyway. Dairy will take a while to fully digest and you could become nauseous. Get an insulated jug for water. Don't forget to clean and dry it after each day's practice, so it doesn't gunk up inside.

Eat healthy foods! Eating food that wouldn't benefit your body in the first place will be even worse after such a strenuous activity such as marching. People seem to discredit how tiring it is- Heavy clothing and walking around in the sun all day is hard enough, but doing that with any instrument- from a lightweight piccolo to a fifty-pound bass drum- will surely exhaust you. Eat what you would before a workout, and plan to drink throughout the day.
Wear movable clothing and comfortable, athletic shoes. Dress appropriately for the weather and don't forget a jacket and gloves if it will get cold.

, Take extra care if you're a freshman; make sure you get fitted for one. This way you can avoid disasters before an actual show at a competition. Minutes before your first show is not the time to learn the intricacies of tying your citation cord, discover that your pants are too short or too long, or learn that nobody ever issued you a plume.

,


Insert the brass mouthpiece or woodwind part firmly enough that it doesn't fly out when snapped up and down. Tape them during the show.Remove tape as soon as possible to avoid getting the mouthpiece sticky or ruining it
Avoid getting a woodwind wet, especially the pads - they will fall off. If you are forced to march in the rain close all holes/keys. Use your cleaning cloth to dry the instrument after each practice. If you ever have to get pads replaced on your marching instrument, ask for plastic pads.
Oil your valves or slide before practice. It's much harder from mid-field.
For percussion, take the opportunity to learn from your drum instructor how to tie cymbals properly and how to replace and tune a drumhead. If you don't already know those instruments as well as you know the instruments you spend the most time at, be it at a lesson or in the school auditorium, you need to take the initiative to ask someone how they work in full detail. Trust the words of every percussionist ever- not only will it keep the instruments in good condition for this session of camp, but it will also further your musical education and may come in handy in other performances, auditions and ensembles.
Learn the proper way to set your instrument down: not on its keys or delicate valves. If you must set your instrument on the ground, set it with the others from your section in a formation. It's a nice flourish and shows off sectional spirit, and it might help save them from a careless foot. However, remember that your protective case or a stand made for the instrument is the most secure place to keep it.
Consider marching a second-string instrument, particularly during rehearsals. You can buy one on Ebay or even at a garage sale.

, Band camp can be strenuous, and it's easier if you're well rested.

, Often they are busy or stressed, so be understanding.

, The more effort you put in at band camp, the easier it will be at competitions. You don't want to spend all your time later in the season playing catch-up. (This is especially for brass players. Holding up the horn requires a lot of endurance!)

, If you're an underclassman, don't try to boss others around as if you're the section leader. On the flip side, if you're an upperclassman, don't alienate and harass those younger than you. If you treat the new people poorly, they won't return the next season. Everyone should keep in mind that while they may not like the band captains or drum major(s), they are the highest in student leadership. The same goes for section leaders: you don't have to like them, but you should listen to them, after all they are there to help you and they were chosen for a reason!

, Many bands have parents as chaperones. They are there on their own time, often using vacation time. Chaperones assist the band director. They are not there to pick up after you.

, For example, saying things like ""Wow, the flags were really off today,"" or ""The trumpets are way too loud,"" is a BAD idea, especially if you're an underclassmen. It's not your place to judge the other sections, and it's a great way to make enemies, which is something you don't want to do. If there is a correction to be made, the BD will make it. As a camp community, remember, you have to work as a team. If something goes wrong in one section and you talk badly of it, not only does it reflect badly on you, but will also reflect badly on the community as a whole. If you work together as a team with a positive mindset, you're sure to thrive together- and you'll learn something great along the way!

Prepare the fuel cylinder.,
Conduct a gas leak check.,
Light the gas stove.,
Cook food on your stove.",How to Use a Camping Gas Stove,"


Check that the burner control knobs and the fuel cylinder regulator knobs are in the ""Off"" position.
Attach the fuel cylinder to the regulator valve attachment on the gas stove (if they are separate pieces). Keep the cylinder upright.
Attach the other end of the regulator valve assembly to the stove by hand-tightening it.;
,


Ensure that the regulator knob and the burner control knobs are in the ""Off"" position.
Make sure that both the regulator attachment and cylinder are secured to the gas stove.
Prepare a mixture of 1 part dish-washing liquid to 3 parts water.
Apply the soapy mixture to the fittings at the stove and cylinder, and all along the hose attachment.
Open the regulator valve counterclockwise 2 turns and check for bubbles at both ends and along the hose. Do not leave the gas on longer than 10 seconds. If bubbles occur, turn the regulator knob off and re tighten all the connections by hand again. Repeat the bubble test until all connections are secure.

,


Open the regulator knob to the fuel cylinder slowly, about 1 to 2 turns. Hold a long fireplace match or fireplace lighter over the burner to ignite the gas. Adjust the regulator knob as needed.

, A camping stove's gas burners will supply the same amount of heat as a gas kitchen stove. A 2-burner stove will allow you the most flexibility in cooking, and should enable you to cook a traditional 2-pot meal, or prepare meats in a pan on 1 side and a side dish on the other side.


Place your pot or pan on your lit burner. Depending on what you are cooking, adjust the level of flame as you would on a regular gas stove. Keep in mind that the fuel from a propane container will burn more quickly than a regular stove, so although you may leave the stove on while preparing your meal, prepare to have a back-up container of propane.

Stay friends with other girls.",How to Pretend to Be a Tomboy at Summer Camp," You may feel embarrassed, or just not want to tell anyone at home. That's fine, you can probably find the right sort of stuff. But if you show up in a dress, or even have one in your suitcase, you'll be teased!;
, You must have some of these at home, even if you're a skirt and dress girl, you must have something. If not, you could raid sisters drawers, or, buy some. Don't be afraid to even look in your brothers drawers!

, If you're hanging with guys, chances are they like sports, if you find some tops, or T. Shirts, you'll look the part. Try sports shops or sneak into your brothers room! Don't be afraid to check the boys section.

, This is optional, but a sporty cap would look good, not pink though, you could start a trend.

, Investing in a cool pair of Converse or Vans for the summer, will really look good. Don't go for colors like black, you'll look like a try hard. Blue is cool, but probably dark blue, or red. Then maybe get some cheaper pairs, so you don't always wear the same shoes.

, But if you show up with pink ones, no one will buy it. Maybe get some footballs (or 'soccer' balls as the Americans would say), or plain gold studs, or hoops for the evening.

, Quickly brush through your hair, lean forwards, scoop it all up and tie it with a plain black, white or blue band. Maybe took it through the back of a cap, try to make it neat so it doesn't draw attention, but, do it first time. Maybe practice before you go.

, Just pull it back and tie it, maybe took it into your t. shirt/jacket to hide it more. Don't be afraid of it looking bad!

, Start doing a low ponytail, then either don't finish pulling the hair through an leave it, or just fold it up and tie it. Tuck it in, to show you don't really care.

, Of course it's less tomboy, but you can wear it down, especially if you have a fringe (bangs). You can either clip them up, or wear them down. Maybe clip the front bit up, and leave the rest down.

, This is quite girly, but not overly, you can do them scruffy, messy, big small, just don't take ages.

, If you're mean or rude to the other girls, just for being girly, they won't like you. Remember, you have to live with these girls. Be polite, but don't make any close friends.

, Okay, you've never slept on a bottom bunk before, usually you'd be joining in the arguments for the top, but let it go... It's just a bed. If you choose activities, say you'd rather do certain ones-and pick the masculine ones, where you'll meet more guys.

, There's nothing worse than a tomboy wanna-be. Just make it clear, you like sports, don't really care about make up, etc.

,, Choose one you think looks like a good mate, a gang may be hard at first, especially if you're naturally shy. Don't say 'mate' yet, just either say 'hey' or 'what's up'. Don't speak femininely or make a big deal that you're a girl. Then tell them your name. If you have a unisex name, go with that. If your name is Alexa or Alexis, go with Alex. If your name is Samantha, go with Sam. If you have a really girly name, just use it calmly, if you can't come up with a boy-ish name.

, If you're that desperate, 'where are you from?' works. Hopefully they will respond with questions for you, try to talk about sports, learn a bit before you come. Music's alright, just don't mention One Direction, talk about bands they like.

, Chances are, they guy you met has other mates, soon you should all be friends. Don't take charge of the gang, but make the others laugh a lot. Don't seem fake. Just, don't be quiet or they won't notice you and you may be ignored.

, Guys don't like that.

, Guys joke-a lot! They will tease you, and tease them back a bit. Also, guys may have fake arguments, and call each a name for a part of a boy you don't have. Then the come-back 'at least I have one' is used. Don't use that come back, and if they say it to you, just carry on like a guy would, it's not sexist.

,, Don't overdo it, but maybe just a smidgen will be cool, one of them may fancy you!

, After awhile, you may wish to style your hair a bit.

, Even when being a tomboy, don't shut out the girls in your bunk.

Pack your bags together.,
Make sure you pack the following items for your stuffed animal:


Enough clothes.,
Don't put your stuffed animal in a suitcase- carry him or her with you!,

",How to Take a Stuffed Animal to Sleepaway Camp," This will give your pal a special space for all of his or her stuff, and will ensure your stuff doesn't get mixed up with your stuffie's. Since your stuffed animal won't need very much stuff, the bag doesn't have to be very big. A small tote bag will do.;
, Look through your packing list and get your stuffed animal's input on decisions. Not sure if you should wear that shirt with the pants or the skirt? Ask your stuffed animal!

, Some stuffed animals want to change clothes frequently, and some don't wear clothes at all. Don't give a stuffed animal who changes clothes daily one pair, and don't give stuffed animal who doesn't wear clothes twenty outfits.
If you don't sleep with your stuffed animal, sleeping supplies, like blankets, pillow, etc.
Plastic food in case your stuffed animal gets hungry.
A brush if your stuffed animal has long fur.
A washcloth
Other things your stiffed animal wants, like a favorite book, a picture from home, etc.

, Would you like it if you were stuck in a dark place with barely enough room to breathe? If you are traveling with strangers and are embarrassed, put your buddy in a drawstring bag with all your entertainment for the ride there.

, Do you both like beds by the window? Get one by the window! You both like top bunk? Get top bunk!

,, It's probably not a good idea to take him or her swimming, but your friend might enjoy a hike!

,, Tell your friend the name of a tree you pass by, teach him or her how to knit, anything you've learned at camp!

, Have a play date during free time or rest time and get as many campers as you can to bring their stuffed animals.

, Have a part of the letter where your stuffed animal can say something! Maybe your stuffed animal misses the other stuffed animals. Have him or her write a letter to them! Since stuffed animals can't write, be the scribe.

, Are you homesick? Cuddle with your stuffed animal! If your stuffed animal gets homesick, give him/her a big hug.

Getting a letter from a sibling or a best friend can help you feel loved and connected to the place you temporarily left behind.


If you want to make an extra effort to get your friends to write to you, you can even hand them envelopes that are stamped and addressed to you, so that all they have to do is write the letter, place it in the envelope, and send it on its way.;
, One way to make summer camp more fun for yourself is to bring more stuff that you like with you. Though you should look into the rules at your camp to know what is and is not permissible, it can be important to bring some extra cool things that may not strictly be necessary, but which might help you make some new friends or just pass the time. Here are some things to consider:

,,, If you’re packing for sleepaway camp, then you may want to pack more than just what the website or camp brochure says you need to bring. Though you want to avoid having any items you’re not allowed to bring, you should try to pack as much useful stuff as you can without going overboard so you don’t feel at a loss when you get to camp. Here are some things you can do:


Bring more underwear than you think you’ll need. It’s better to be safe than to be stuck doing laundry when you don’t feel like it.






Bring extra flashlight batteries. You may not realize how much you’ll be using your flashlight—and how happy you’ll be to have spare batteries.






Bring your favorite snacks if you’re allowed to. If your camp allows it, then you may want to bring some of your favorite candies, chips, or candy bars, especially if you think that food will be kind of hard to find at the camp.






Bring a disposable camera. Though more kids than ever are using their cell phones to take pictures these days, you should bring a disposable camera so you can make memories with your new friends without worrying about losing an expensive piece of technology.






Bring all the hygienic things you need, such as deodorant, shampoo, floss, or anything else you regularly use. Though your camp should have backup items for you, it’s better to be prepared.







, It can make you feel a bit more comfortable to bring your favorite stuffed animal, a picture of your parents or your kitty, or your favorite blanket or pillow from home. This can make you feel less alone and can make you feel safer in a place where everything feels new and strange. However, you want to avoid bringing too much stuff from home, or you’ll be too focused on everything you left behind to focus on all the great things that are happening right in front of you.


Though you should bring some things that remind you of home, make sure to leave some room in your bag for things you may be bringing back from camp, whether it’s photos of you and your new friends or an arts and crafts creation you’re proud of. You may find that you’ll be “camp sick” as soon as you return home!

, These days, a lot of camps are getting more technologically savvy and are posting information for their campers on the Internet. If your camp is like this, then you should spend some time looking over what you need to bring to camp at least a few weeks before the start date so you’re not scrambling to get everything ready at the last possible minute.


Go over this list with your parents so you can both work on having everything you need.
The website may also give you other useful information about what to expect when you’re there, from what the bunking situation will be like to what a typical day at camp will look like for you.

, Though you probably want to look your best at camp, you should remember that you won’t necessarily be wearing the same clothes to camp as you typically wear to school and that you should plan to dress more casual. You can bring clothes that are comfortable and which are similar to gym clothes for more physical activities, and should bring plenty of big t-shirts, cotton shorts, tank tops, or other clothes that you can move around in. You should also make sure to have at least one or two pairs of sneakers so you can comfortably hike, run, or participate in other physical activities.


You can also bring some nicer clothes to wear during non-physical activities, but you shouldn’t feel the pressure to look as dressed up as you might look at school.
Bring more dressy clothes if you’ll need them for a special event. If your camp has a final dance or another more formal event, it’s important to be prepared for that, too.

, Everyone is a little shy on the first few days of camp, even the most outgoing people. However, camp will only last for 2 months or so, so it’s important to start making friends as soon as you can so people don’t break up into social groups and leave you hanging. Just smile, be friendly, say hi to new people and ask them where they’re from. You can also ask kids to join you at a certain activity, whether you’re swimming in a lake or heading to an archery class. The sooner you make an effort to make friends, the sooner you’ll be having a great time at camp.


One way to quickly make new friends is to give people a sincere compliment. Just saying something like, “I like your necklace,” can make a person feel that you’re friendly and approachable.
Don’t put too much pressure on yourself. You don’t have to start looking for your best friend right away or only talk to kids who look like people you’d be friends with in school. Go out on a limb and talk to someone who may not look or act like your “type” of person; you may be pleasantly surprised.
Sharing your things is a great way to make new friends. Offer a new friend some of your homemade cookies, a magazine, or an accessory or game, and you’ll be able to bond more quickly.

, Summer camp is all about going out of your comfort zone and taking risks. While you may be wary of horseback riding or archery, you should sign up for those classes precisely for that reason. Don’t limit yourself and try as many new things as possible so that you can find something you really care about in the process. Even if the activity you choose doesn’t end up being your cup of tea, you may make a new friend — or three — in the process.


If you’re not sure what to pick, try to pick an activity that is the most social, so you’d be likely to make a lot of friends.
However, if there’s something you’ve really wanted to try, such as painting or woodworking, and it’s less popular with the kids, don’t let that stop you from exploring something you’re interested in.
It’s fun to go outside your area of expertise, though. If you’ve never acted and even feel a bit nervous on stage, try signing up for a theatre class. If the class is going to perform a play towards the end of the camp session, you can aim for a small role or even to work backstage.

, Though camp is all about the hustle and bustle, you should try to carve out a bit of time for yourself, especially if you’re more of the introverted type who needs his alone time. Whether you get up a few minutes early to do some light stretching or journaling or you read in bed for half an hour before lights out, it’s important to make just a bit of time for yourself so you don’t get too wound up. That said, you shouldn’t miss out on too many social opportunities because of “me time.”


If you’re feeling kind of sad and sulky and like being alone, it’s okay to do that for a little while as you regain your energy. However, you’ll be having fun much more quickly if you force yourself to get up and join an activity, whether you’re singing by the campfire or playing Red Rover.

, Sure, there are annoying things about every summer camp, from pesky mosquitoes to soggy food to counsellors who are less than kind. However, there are also plenty of great things to be happy about, from the nice weather to the beautiful campgrounds, and you should work on talking about the things you love about camp instead of the things you hate. If you start complaining, then your friends will start complaining too, and pretty soon you’ll be headed in a downward spiral of negativity and will find yourself feeling much less happy than you would have been if you had focused on the positive.


Besides, if you get a reputation of being the kid who complains all the time, then people will be less inclined to hang out with you.
It’s okay to get something off your chest every once in a while. But if you catch yourself making a negative comment, try to counter it with two positive comments later in the conversation.

, Though it can be fun to tease and even to taunt your camp counselor, if you want to make the most of your time at camp, then you should try to be as nice and friendly to your counselor as you can, without making it seem like you’re sucking up. If you’re friendly with your counselor, then your time at camp will be easier, and you may even be able to get away with a bit more. You don’t need to stick by your counselor’s side all the time to form a fun, friendly relationship with him or her.


Remember that, however mature they may seem, camp counselors are often just a handful of years older than you. Just like ordinary people, they can get overwhelmed by intense, stressful situations, especially if they have fifteen kids all competing for their attention at once. If you see that your counselor could use a bit of help carrying, cleaning, or organizing something, step up to the plate.
Of course, you don’t want to get a reputation for being a suck up and to try so hard to please your counselor that you end up alienating some of the other kids. Just treat him or her with kindness and respect and you’ll be on your way to having a great time at camp.

, Summer camp can be even more fun if you feel more involved in the action. If your counselor or chief administrators at camp ask for a volunteer to help them clean or carry something, or to take over a small additional responsibility, don’t be afraid to raise your hand. Getting another friend or two to help can make the whole thing even more fun. While you may be reluctant to do something that feels like “extra work,” volunteering can make you feel more involved and active in the daily activities of your camp.


Volunteering will also make you feel good for helping others, even if you’re just carrying some boxes over to a different part of the camp or cleaning up an old campfire.

, Most times, you won’t even realize that the end of camp is creeping up on you. You might have had an amazing time and made some memories you will never forget with new people who have changed your life forever. However, you might be feeling shy about what to do once camp is over and you return back to your normal life. Don’t be shy about asking your new friends for their numbers, if they will be your Facebook friends, or even if you can talk on the phone once camp is over. This will make you love your camp experience even more.


If your camp friends happen to live pretty close to you, then you can even make plans to hang out after the fun is over. This can be a great way to grow closer to your new friends and to reminisce about camp memories.
If you stay in touch with your new friends at camp, then you’ll be even more excited to return the following summer.

, Even if your summer camp experience is like paradise, it won’t come without some discomfort. The best thing you can do is accept it and learn to live with it. Yes, there will be more mosquitoes than there are in your bedroom at home. Yes, it may be harder to sleep with twenty other people in the cabin with you. Yes, some days you may just want to take a break and read a magazine or watch TV and that may not be possible. However, once you let go of the fact that some of the negative aspects of camp are outside of your control, you’ll be able to accept them and will embrace all of the positive things that camp has to offer.


Sure, no one likes mosquito bites, but complaining about them won’t make them go away, either. Instead, look for practical solutions, such as bug spray or mosquito netting, to make them less likely to bother you and move on from there.

, Unfortunately, there are times when camp can feel just as catty as middle or high school. Some girls like to be part of cliques, make fun of others, and start gossiping on occasion. Though this shouldn’t be the norm at camp, if you find yourself in one of these situations, do your best to stay out of it and to not pick sides. If your friends are gossiping or spreading rumors, excuse yourself from the drama and spend more time with positive people who have nice things to say about other people.


If you’re the target of the drama, then you just have to learn to keep your head up and not let it get to you. Don’t fight fire with fire by starting more rumors about the people who spread them and work on brushing the bad vibes off your shoulder and finding people who make you feel good about yourself.

, If you’re having a bad day or week at camp or just feel like you can’t get along with anyone, then you need to remind yourself about all of the amazing friends who care about you back home, even if they’re far away. Read letters they wrote you, write them letters, or even make a phone call to them if it’s allowed, to see that there are plenty of people who do think you’re special. While you want to work on adapting to your new environment as much as you can, thinking of your friends during a hard time can help make you feel more comforted.


If you brought a few photos of your friends from back home to camp, then looking through them can remind you of the good times and make you feel loved. Just don’t mope or focus on your friends back home too much, or you’ll be making it more difficult for yourself to make new friends.

, You may not be liking summer camp because you feel like there are too many things you’re not suited for, whether it’s spending a long time out in the sun or going horseback riding or hiking. However, if you want to stay strong at camp, you can’t let yourself think you’re not strong, skilled, or smart enough to participate in the many activities your camp has to offer. Tell yourself that you only have a few weeks to try a variety of cool new things and work on trying out the things that initially scared you. You’ll find that you’ll be growing as a person—and liking camp much more—in the process.


You don’t have to dive into something you’re completely afraid of head-first. Instead, you can ease yourself into the new activities. For example, if you’re afraid of going off the high dive, don’t run and dive right off of it with your eyes closed; instead, work on jumping off the sides of the pool or the low dive into the water, until you’ve built up the courage to jump off the high dive properly.

, To make the most of your time at camp, you should avoid getting into arguments with the heads of the camp or even finding yourself being punished for misbehaving. Though it may be tempting to act out if you’re not having a good time, or just because you’re used to following less rules in the summertime, if you want to enjoy your time at camp, you should work on being friendly and agreeable with the heads and counselors at your camp and following the rules as much as you can.


Your time at camp won’t be nearly as fun if you spend half of it being in trouble instead of being allowed to spend time with your friends.
If you’re unclear about some of the rules, such as curfew or what you can do in the pool, don’t be afraid to ask a counselor. You’ll be better off asking extra questions instead of breaking a rule without knowing it.

, If you find yourself feeling extremely homesick, whether you’re going to day camp or spending two months at sleepaway camp, the first thing you should know is that these feelings are perfectly natural. Don’t be embarrassed about them and even talk about them with a counselor or your new friends; you’ll find that you’re not alone and that everyone is missing home at least a little bit. Just talk to your family if you can, look at things that remind you of home, and then work to move forward and to join in on some of the fun activities your camp has to offer.


While it can be helpful to acknowledge your feelings of homesickness instead of being in denial, it’s also important to work on keeping busy as soon as you can so you can find something to take your mind off of home.
The more of an effort you make to make new friends, the less you’ll be missing your old ones. Don’t think of this as trying to replace your old friends, but simply as trying to branch out.

, Though you might have rolled your eyes when your mom or dad told you that summer camp builds character, you should know that this is actually completely true. Kids who go to summer camp develop a greater sense of independence when they learn to live apart from their parents. They also gain self-esteem from trying new activities they never thought they were capable of mastering. What’s more, they gain social skills because they learn how to make friends more easily. Even if you feel like you can’t wait to get back home, just tell yourself that being at camp is actually good for you.


You may not feel like you’ve grown as a person or benefitted much from your camp experience while you’re there, but when you return home, you’ll see that you’ve become a stronger, more dynamic person as a result of your time at camp.

Electronics. A laptop with a charger and a case is strongly recommended for research and word processing. A camera, USB drive and a scientific calculator are absolute musts. A small printer with cartridges is also recommended.






Study Supplies. Bring plenty of notebooks, pencils and pens, looseleaf paper, printing paper, sticky notes, highlighters, sharpies, a ruler, required textbooks, and anything else you might need.






Extras. Blank CDs, scissors, glue, a protractor, and other common items can come in handy during your session.







, Make sure that you have everything that you need.

, All your outfits together, all your your shirts together, or just fold them and put them in your trunk/bag/suitcase. Most people find it easier to put your daily outfits (including underwear and socks) in freezer bags. It helps keep your suitcase neat so you don't have to dig around looking for clothes.

, Get your trunk/bag/suitcase and first put the things that you'll take out last, or you won't use very often. Then put in all your clothes. After that, put in the things you will use a lot or you will need first, such as your flashlight, sunscreen, and toiletries. If you are going to pack your sheets and blankets, pack those last because the first thing you'll do when you get there is make your bed. It is usually easier to pack them separately.

, You might want to do this when you finish packing and on the night before you go. This step is very important. You wouldn't want to get there and realize you didn't pack any socks!

, This is so you can make sure that you have everything when you're packing up to go home again.

Keep your showers short.,
Think simple at camp.,
Think simple for your hair, too.,
Moisturize your body.",How to Prepare for a Camping Trip/Summer Camp (for Girls)1," It's recommended that you take a short shower, so other girls have time to shower.


Get a wax before the trip/camp. Get a wax kit and wax your legs, underarms, face etc. before you go. You will probably be too busy to shave, and this takes a little bit of worry away from your trip.
Bring a big enough wash bag to contain all your toiletries for when you go to the bathroom block.;
, The fewer products, the better. For your face, get some foaming cloths or pads that you just have to run under water. Wash your face and moisturize with a light oil-free moisturizer with at least SPF 15.


Make sure you bring chap stick or a lip butter to keep your lips clean, healthy, and moisturized.
Add a touch of concealer, some waterproof mascara and a dab of nude or light pink/red lip gloss; this should be all you need for make up while traveling. If you don't want to add mascara, consider just curling your eyelashes. But remember you are camping: you don't need to look your best!
For an extra little glow, smile and dab a little bit of Vaseline on the ""apples"" (fleshy part)of your cheeks. But don't use too much or your face will feel oily.
Keep your eyebrows groomed. A tiny dab of Vaseline and a comb through with an old toothbrush will keep them in shape. Take care not to accidentally use the same toothbrush to brush your teeth after!
Cut and file your nails and toenails before you go, and also put on a clear coat of polish. Your nails will be shiny and well groomed, but not overdone for camping.

, You shouldn't be blow-drying your hair during the summer. Already the heat is drying out your hair and you don't want to totally dry it out by adding more heat. After you get out of the shower, spray your hair with a leave-in conditioner and comb, then towel dry. Rub in a dollop of anti-frizz or smoothing serum all over your hair, especially to the ends! Pull up your hair in a messy bun then let it air dry.

, After you get out the shower, slather on a body lotion enriched with vitamin E. Rub on some deodorant because you will most likely be sweating from the heat and activities. Sunscreen is an absolute must and be sure to reapply it every 2 - 4 hours. Invest in a good athletic sunscreen that is sweat- and waterproof. Spray-on sunscreens are easier to apply and less messy than other sunscreens.

"
"
Pack appropriate items.,
Print out the packing list from the Christian camp's website and check everything to make sure you have everything you need, including glasses, contact lenses, and if you're a girl pack sanitary napkins/tampons as needed.

,
Camping Items.,
Last but not least, bring these with you as well: A Christian Bible (the camp will provide study topics and materials), money for missions (if there are any), stationery, plus a small flashlight and a camera with extra batteries for both.

",How to Pack for Christian Camp," Do not pack offensive or controversial t-shirts, any kind of revealing clothing, such as pants with drop waists.


Clothing. Shorts must have a minimum 4-inch inseam. Pack at least a daily change of clothes, including modest undergarments and crew socks. Take extra clothes for recreation and special activities.






Shoes. Wear tennis shoes. You may be running, hiking, or other outdoor activities. Flip-flops are a good idea too, but just for the lake or pool.






The Essentials. Bring twin size sheets, a pillow, comforter/raincoat (optional, per need), and pajamas (as warm as need). Towels, washcloths, soap, shampoo (and conditioner as needed), toothpaste and toothbrush, deodorant, comb and brush, sun block and insect repellent are recommended.

,, If you're staying in a tent, bring a tent, sleeping bag, and other reasonable camping items.

Combine the marinade ingredients.,
Distribute the marinade throughout the pork.,
Marinate for at least 4 hours.,
Drain the marinade.,
Combine the dry rub ingredients.,
Brush the pork with the mustard.,
Work the rub into the pork.,
Soak the wood chips.,
Preheat the smoker between 225 and 250 degrees Fahrenheit (105 and 120 degrees Celsius).,
Smoke the pork for 2 hours.,
Baste and continue cooking.,
Baste hourly.,
Wrap the pork in foil.,
Smoke the pork butt until it cooks through.,
Let it stand.,
Serve the pork.",How to Smoke a Pork Butt," Place the apple cider vinegar, vegetable oil, salt, paprika, Worcestershire sauce, and black pepper in a non-reactive bowl. Whisk together until evenly combined.


If desired, you may substitute this marinade for your favorite barbecue pork marinade. Both homemade and commercially made mixtures should work well.;
, Reserve 1 cup (250 ml) of marinade for later, then use the rest to marinate the pork. Inject some of the marinade directly into the pork and pour the rest over the meat.


You'll use the reserved portion of marinade to baste the pork as it smokes. Never reuse marinade that touches raw meat for basting purposes as the meat cooks.
Place the meat into a shallow baking dish before injecting it since some of the marinade may seep out. You should inject marinade into the meat at four or five spots, spaced evenly around the pork butt.
At each injection site, insert the loaded needle and inject only one-third of the marinade. Instead of completely removing the needle, turn it into the same spot at a different angle and inject another third of the marinade. Repeat once more at the same injection site.After injecting the marinade into the pork, place the meat inside a large resealable plastic bag. Pour the rest of the marinade and any injection drippings inside the bag, as well, then seal the bag and turn it as needed to coat all sides of the pork.

, Place the pork in the refrigerator and allow it to absorb the marinade for 4 to 8 hours.The longer you allow the meat to marinate, the more tender and flavorful it will be.

, Remove the pork from the refrigerator and from the bag of marinade. Pat the surface dry with clean paper towels.


Allow the pork butt to sit out at room temperature for approximately 30 to 45 minutes. By allowing the pork butt to sit out at room temperature, you also bring the internal temperature of the meat closer to room temperature. Room temperature pork will cook quicker than cold pork.
If you get impatient, you can apply the dry rub as it sits, but you should not begin smoking the meat until after that amount of time passes.

, Place the sugar, salt, black pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, cumin, and sage in a jar. Seal the jar and shake it well to combine the spices.


As with the marinade, you can use another dry rub for the pork instead of this one, and both homemade and commercially made types should work adequately well.

, Use a basting brush to coat all sides of the pork butt with yellow mustard. Keep the coating light and even.


The mustard will act like glue and should help the dry rub cling to the surface of the pork.

, Sprinkle the dry rub evenly over all sides of the pork. Use your hands to work the rub into the meat.


Once you finish seasoning the pork butt, set it aside in a safe room temperature location and prepare your smoker.

, Place several handfuls of apple and hickory wood chips in a dish and cover them with water. Allow the chips to soak for at least 30 minutes.


Damp wood chips produce more smoke and less fire. Using wood chips also gives the smoke more flavor, and the type of wood chip used will alter that flavor further.
After the wood chips have finished soaking, remove them from water but do not attempt to wring out any of the excess moisture.

, Spread the drenched and drained wood chips over the lit charcoal.


The exact procedure you'll need to follow when setting up the smoker will vary on the exact model, so check the instruction manual to determine the proper steps.
While you're waiting for the smoker to heat up, insert a meat thermometer into the pork. While standard meat thermometers will work, the easiest to use will be a digital thermometer with an internal probe and remote display.

, Place the pork on the smoker and close the lid. Allow it to smoke, undisturbed, for approximately 2 hours.


Place the pork butt on the pit with the bone-side facing down. The upper layer of fat should eventually render and drip downward, keeping the meat moist as it does.
Until you start basting the meat, you should avoid opening the smoker. Opening the door will case the temperature inside the smoker to drop, which can dramatically increase the overall cooking time.

, After the first 2 hours, baste the pork with some of the reserved marinade. Return it to the smoker and continue cooking it for another hour.


Regular basting is important. Without it, the outside of the pork butt may dry out before the inside finishes cooking. Basting also makes the meat more tender and flavorful.
To avoid contaminating the mixture with bacteria from undercooked pork, transfer it to a sterile spray bottle and spray it over the surface of the pork rather than brushing it on.If you forgot to set aside some of the marinade for basting or if you run out of it during the smoking process, quickly whisk together a new half batch using 1 cup (250 ml) apple cider vinegar, 1/2 cup (125 ml) vegetable oil, 2 Tbsp (30 ml) salt, 1 Tbsp (15 ml) paprika, 1 Tbsp (15 ml) Worcestershire sauce, and 1 Tbsp (15 ml) ground black pepper.

, Baste the pork again, then let it smoke for another hour. Baste the pork once more after that hour passes, then smoke it for yet another hour.


In this recipe, the pork butt cooks uncovered for a total of 4 hours. Larger portions will need longer cooking times. When the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius), you can move onto the next step. Continue basting hourly until the meat reaches that temperature.

, Remove the pork from the smoker and wrap it in heavy-duty aluminum foil. Place the wrapped pork on the smoker.


If you have leftover basting marinade, apply it to all sides of the pork butt before wrapping the foil around it.
The foil envelops the pork in a humid environment. You can technically skip the foil step and finish cooking the meat without wrapping it, but doing so will produce a drier, firmer crust. The inner meat should be fine either way, though.

, Allow the pork to remain on the smoker until it reaches an internal temperature of 200 degrees Fahrenheit (93 degrees Celsius). For a 4 to 5 lb (1.8 to 2.3 kg) pork butt, this may take an additional hour. Larger portions will need even longer cooking times.


If desired, you can also finish cooking the wrapped pork in an oven preheated to 250 degrees Fahrenheit (120 degrees Celsius). You'll still need to check the internal temperature of the pork for doneness, and the process should take roughly the same amount of time.

, Remove the pork from the smoker and allow it to rest, away from the heat and in its foil wrappings, for 15 to 20 minutes.


As the pork rests, the juices previously concentrated in the center of the meat should distribute themselves more thoroughly, resulting in juicier, more tender cuts.

, The pork butt should be fully cooked and ready to enjoy. You can cut it into slices or shred it for use as pulled pork.

Make a list of clothing, toiletries, and other things you will need or ask a camp supervisor for a list of things you will need.,
Make sure you have shirts, tanks, shorts, jeans, sneakers, boots, underwear, socks, sports bras, capri pants, a hat, bathing suits, and something of every variety of clothing.,
Shop for the things you don't have, and bring the list with you so you know exactly what you need.,
In the last few days before camp, check off everything on the list to ensure you have everything.,
The day before camp, wash and dry everything you'll be taking to camp and pack it neatly.",How to Pack for Camp (for Girls)," They will be happy to supply you one, and even if they cannot provide you a list they can answer any questions you have. Most of the time a detailed list will be provided by the camp during registration. Many camps do not allow you to bring outside food because it can attract animals, so if you want to take some snacks, confirm that it is allowed first.;
, Clothes are the number one thing you will need because you will be participating in a lot of rigorous and often dirty activities. Everyone at camp usually needs to change outfits at least once per day. There is no substitute for a duffel bag full of clothes.


Be sure to pack your hygienic supplies, such as a toothbrush and toothpaste, a hairbrush, deodorant (very important!), a bottle of shampoo, a shaving razor, and any other things you might need. If you believe you will have your period during the trip, be sure to pack some large boxes of tampons, pads, and even a few extra pairs of heavy-duty underwear.






Bring anything else you might need: a water bottle, bug spray, a flashlight, sunglasses, sunscreen, . Chances are, you will be hiking, swimming (if there is a lake), and doing other outdoor activities, so be prepared for anything and everything.







, You don't want to buy another bottle of sunscreen when you have three bottles lying around at home!

, If you find that you do not have all of the items, go and get what you need as soon as possible. It's better to be prepared early but there will always be things that you have to stuff in your bags at the last minute.

, You may very likely need several bags or boxes to hold everything, but try to keep it all organized.

Drink plenty of water and try to eat healthy food.,
Bring feminine hygiene products unless you are absolutely sure you will not need them.

,
Don't forget insect repellent and sunscreen.,
Make sure a first aid kit will be available.",How to Prepare for a Camping Trip/Summer Camp (for Girls)2," It's summertime, so there is almost always an abundance of fresh fruit and vegetables. Pick your own - it'll taste the sweetest you've ever had. (Just be sure to know exactly what you are picking, and don't get anything poisonous.)

,, Insect bites and sunburn can make your trip miserable.

, If this is a group trip, the sponsor or organizers should have this covered, but for a trip with family or friends, you may have to supply your own. Pack some antibiotic ointment, allergy medication, band aids, and toilet paper in it, at least. Don't forget bandages and tubi griped

Bring a pair of comfortable walking shoes for activities where walking and standing are normal, and possibly flip-flops or sandals for walking to the pool or lake to swim or boat.

,
Consider wearing a swim suit under your clothes.

",How to Prepare for a Camping Trip/Summer Camp (for Girls)3," If you will be swimming, it might be a good idea to bring an extra suit, so you can allow one to dry while using the other on an alternating basis. Bring shorts, tee shirts, and extra socks, especially if you will be doing any hiking.

, For colder regions, a sweater or light jacket may be appropriate for nighttime activities.

, Wearing a hat with a wide brim will protect your face from the sun and make you feel a little cooler in the heat of the day.

,,"

Before you leave for camp, think about how you are going to store everything when you are there.,
Buy some magnetic/adhesive hooks.,
Shoe organisers will help save some room.,
Get a laundry hamper.,
If your bunk is not metal or magnetic, get yourself a cork note-board to pin up pictures, letters and other memorabilia you might want to keep.",How to Organize and Decorate Your Camp Bunk1," A good idea is to get some collapsible storage bins that you can store things like shoes and folded clothes in, then slide them under your bunk and out of the way. If you prepare storage properly, it's much easier to keep your things tidy whilst you're at camp.;
, These can attach to your bunk and are useful for hanging things like hats, jackets, lanyards and other things that are easily lost. (If you buy adhesive hooks, make sure you can remove them when it is time to come home!)

, Keep all your shoes together and not strewn across the floor by getting yourself a shoe organiser.

, This will be essential for your time at camp to keep your dirty laundry separate from your clean clothes! You could even get two and use one to store extra pillows and bed sheets. Pop-up hampers are best as when they are not being used, they can be folded and put away.

, This will stop things from getting lost and can also end up being a nice collection of memories from camp.

Pick your camp.,
Gather your personal items.,
Organize your clothes.,
Bring additional supplies.,
Research your camp.,
Bring specific items.",How to Pack for Camp1," Don’t choose a camp based on something you don’t enjoy like computer programming, if you don’t like it. Research different camps based on your interests. There are so many different camps today that vary in a wide array of specialties.


A popular camp for young kids is rock camp. This teaches younger children about the history of rock and the rudiments of a rock instrument.;
, Your personal items are items or clothing you own that you cannot live without. This doesn’t include forms of electronics. For most camps these days, one aim is to remove yourself from electronics. Personal items are small knick-knacks that hold sentimental value to you like a doll, photograph, or charm.

, Depending on the duration of your camp, you’ll need a variety of clothing options. You should try to stay on the light side of packing. Consider the following for a one week camp, and double the amount for a two week camp:


6 short sleeve shirts
1 long sleeve shirt
4 pairs of shorts
1 swim suit
1 light jacket/sweatshirt
6 pairs of underwear
6 pairs of socks
1 baseball cap
1 pair of sneakers
1 pair of sandals, It might be more enjoyable if you bring some additional supplies like a day pack. Instead of bringing electronics for entertainment bring books or comic books. It could also be useful to bring a journal and a pen.

, All camps offer different services. Look into what your camp recommends you bring. These are to be taken seriously and can be adapted depending on the person. After registering for the camp, you should receive a packet of information either in the mail or through email.

, Depending on what camp you’ve chosen, you may be required to bring specific supplies. Check the checklist and information provided by each camp. Camps want you to be prepared and will give you the information of what you should expect well before the camp starts.

Understand backpacking.,
Understand packing a backpack.,
Pick a backpack.,
Gather additional supplies.,
Pack the right clothing.,
Check the program’s recommendations.",How to Pack for Camp2," Backpacking is the ultimate form of camping in the wilderness. It allows you and your group to carry everything you need for a successful and safe hike. Backpacking is also an exhausting endeavor.


Evaluate your physical and mental strength before committing to a backpacking trip. This will help both you and your group.

, Most modern backpacks are top loaded giving you access to the main compartment through the top. The bottom of your pack should be reserved for items to be used in setting up camp like a tent. All heavy items should be positioned in the center of the pack. This includes pots, pans and other cookware.


The top portion of your pack should include all the supplies you might need during your hike like snacks, tools, and a map., Check if your program provides a backpack for campers. Some will allow you to bring your own. You’ll probably need an extended trip or multi-day pack. These are anywhere from 50 liters to larger.


Get fit for your backpack at an outdoors store to avoid injury.

, You will definitely need certain supplies regardless of your trip. These supplies include a headlamp, sunscreen, matches/lighter, multi-tool pocket knife, and a water bottle.


Most camps won’t require you to bring food and cookware.
You could play it safe by bringing nuts or other types of energy snacks. Make sure you bring a strong sealable bag to avoid animals from interfering with you., For a summer backpacking trip you should bring multiple wicking t-shirts and underwear. Wicking material allows air to breath through your clothes. You should also bring a rain jacket, sweatshirt, and a baseball cap or a hat that shades your face.

, Every program is different. Some trips specialize in winter backpacking trips. These are intense trips that require additional planning and preparation.

"

Invest in a compression sack.,
Pack a light load.,
Consider simple forms of entertainment.,
Bring a collapsible bag.",How to Pack for Camp3," Compression sacks are designed to compress your clothing to free up space in your suitcase. There are several brands that use a similar design. The bag is designed to compress your clothes together and remove all air from the space.This could end up creating wrinkles. Be sure to roll your clothes instead of folding them.

, Utilize all the space of your luggage by ensuring all pockets of the space are occupied and well distributed. Although it is good to come prepared, you will have access to running water at some point, so washing clothes won't be off the table. Minimizing the clothes you bring to a minimum will open opportunities for other uses of your suitcase.Leave behind the tough decision. If you cannot decide if you should bring a harmonica set, don’t bring it. Trust your instincts, but don’t limit yourself too much. Camp is about having fun.
Consider each item after minimizing your clothing. Truly think about each potential item and ask yourself “will I use this enough to justify bringing it?” Don’t let an through by saying, “yes, I plan to use this. . . maybe.”, You will probably have some sort of down time at camp. Instead of bringing your blackjack set, just bring a deck of cards. Instead of a football that could become bulky when packing, bring a Frisbee.


Everyone enjoys a quick Frisbee toss now and again. It is also a great ice breaker in meeting new friends., You might create crafts or even have the opportunity to bring goodies home with you. Instead of creating a nightmare at the end of your trip, bring an extra bag that can easily fold into your bag. This is also a great place to store dirty clothes for the return trip."

Set up your space.,
Decorate the cabin.,
If you brought books, line them up on a bookshelf.,
Talk to your roommates, and try decorating together.",How to Make a Camp Cabin Seem More Like Home," Many people feel more secure on the bottom bunk, but top bunks offer a unique loft feeling. If you are even the least bit claustrophobic, it is a good idea to choose the top bunk.;
, Set up your belongings around your bunk, but be careful not to place your things in anyone else's area. Take advantage of the unique architecture of your cabin, hanging things from parts of the bed, or lining items up along a windowsill. It is also advisable to keep a flashlight within easy reach, as no one has fun walking around in the dark.

, Hang up posters, pictures from home, and magazine clippings. If you have some extra time, use whatever you've brought with you to make your own decorations. You may also want to tape up letters from home.

, If you don't have one, make one with boxes, pieces of wood/large sticks/logs. It doesn't have to be a ""real"" bookshelf, just two or more heavy objects holding the books up. if you can build one with a top, place the next day's clothes, your makeup, extra flashlight batteries, etc. on top, so you can get to them easily.

, it's a great way to bond, and, it will make everyone feel a little more at home. You can even decorate using a theme!

Invite people to sit and chill with you.",How to Make a Cool Camp Bunk," You have lots of options when it comes to bedding to make your bed awesome. Each person's bed reflects their personality, so use things that describe you! For example, you can:

Use your favorite colors when picking sheets.
Show support for your sports team with your blanket.
Bring a favorite stuffed animal or two.
Pack something with texture, like a fuzzy pillow.;
, These can make you feel more at home, and give you something to talk about with your cabin mates. Some ideas:

A band you really like.
Your favorite celebrity.
A picture of a pet or your family.
Photos of you and your friends.

, It will help people learn your name and express your personality.

Use construction paper, markers, stickers, or anything you can think of!
Incorporate your favorite things, like food or colors.
Write your name in cursive or bubble letters to make it pop.

,

Hang up a calendar to help keep track of trips, special events, and the last day.
Buy a small personal fan that attaches to your bunk to help you stay cool.
A shower caddy can be hung from a bunk and hold a bottle of water, clock, or book.

Pack the right things.,
Care for your skin!,
Be friendly.,
Have a fun time!,
Keep your hair simple.,
Girls, wear little to no make up.,
Remember to drink lots of water.",How to Look Good and Have Fun at Summer Camp," When packing for camp, remember you will have to carry all this around and keep it in order. Don't over pack, you will regret it later even if you are concerned you might forget something. Pack lightly on the makeup and hair products if you're bringing any. Don't forget some little things to make your cabin feel homey, and pack for a little cold weather. Remember: if you feel good in it, you look good in it! Also, pack a small mirror, a brush, face care products and sun block.;
, You can get really dirty and sweaty in camp, and that often results with you having problems with your skin. Some pimples may appear, but don't go popping them right away. If you can't wash your face, use some anti-bacterial wipes on it. Concealer can help also, but use it in moderate amounts.

, No one wants to be around somebody who is mean or negative. Smile and introduce yourself so they will feel comfortable around you. Also, you should include everyone. Feeling lonely would not make someone's summer fun.


When talking to new campers, smile! Remember that it's nicer to see a smiling face than a sad frown. Be talkative; join activities; gain some friends.

, If you really want to be drop-dead gorgeous at camp, it just takes a little effort. Dress cute, accessorize, be friendly, and the most important part: be yourself. If you believe in who you are, you will have some positive energy around yourself that will truly make you beautiful and you will definitely stand out from the crowd.

, Girls, camp is not the place for salon-like hair-dos or curlers with gel and hairspray. You want to have fun, so you shouldn't focus completely on your hair. Take advantage of good hair days by brushing your hair until it's smooth. If you have bangs that do not cooperate, clip them back to show off your natural beauty and complete you hair style. After you shower, brush your hair with a wide-tooth comb and leave it to dry down, or put it up in a messy bun. Don't forget: Ponytails are classics that will always work. Also, two ponytails going down either sides completes the look. Guys, just leave your hair the way it is. But do bring a brush and/or comb.


If your hair often gets all frizzy, you can just tie it into a ponytail or pigtails if you want to. You may also make a beautiful French braid. If you really can't stand the frizziness of your hair and you just can't straighten it, then before camp get an anti-frizz spray or shampoo.

, You can pull off a natural look by drinking plenty of water to hydrate and help your skin, wash and moisturize your face, and a layer or two of chapstick before you go to sleep or outside to keep your lips from getting chapped. If you want to wear makeup, keep it minimal to just a tinted moisturizer, a little liner to open up your eyes, and maybe some clear mascara or use an eyelash curler. Camp is not about looking glamorous, but still feel great.

, Water makes up to 70% of the human body. You should drink at least 8 to 10 glasses of water every day. If you get dizzy, or get a headache at camp, you are probably dehydrated and should drink water immediately.

Address any concerns.",How to Have Fun at Summer Camp1," This will help you figure out what to pack and give you an idea of what to expect. Of course, your activities will vary from day to day, but knowing what the theme of your camp session is, if any, will help you get a general idea of what you will be doing every day.;
, If you're going to be doing a horseback riding camp, you don't want to find out five days in that you brought only one pair of pants and your guitar. If you're doing a music or band camp, you don't want to have five pairs of riding boots and a riding helmet with you. Make sure that the things you'll be doing and the things you bring match up.

, Talk to your parents or someone who has experience with the camp about any worries you may have. Chances are, they will have some helpful advice for you and maybe some stories to tell!

Accept that the first day is always the hardest.,
Talk to some of the people in your cabin/tent.,
Introduce yourself.,
If you are not doing any activities that first day, play a few games with some of your cabin/tent-mates.,
Try to get a good night's sleep!",How to Have Fun at Summer Camp2," On the first day, you're getting to know everyone and adjusting to a new place. This is likely the day when you will feel most homesick and most tired as well, so if you feel any of this, it is completely normal!


Of course, don't over-think this, or you will make yourself feel really awful. Try to keep your mind off of how you might get homesick and have fun with your day.

, Making friends with your bunkmate (the person who sleeps below or above you, depending on whether or not you are on the top bunk or the bottom bunk) is easiest, but talk to some of your other cabin-mates/tent-mates too. Chances are, you will find that you and your cabin-mates/tent-mates will have at least one thing in common!


Usually, every unit has at least one camper who will say hello to everyone and make them feel included. Go up and talk to this person, and you may find yourself making friends with them!
If there's no one in your unit who says hi to every new person that comes in, step in and be that person! You'll make a lot of new friends this way and not only will it make them feel more comfortable, it'll make you feel pretty good too!
If you're feeling shy, don't forget that, especially if you're sharing a unit with people who are at camp for the first time, everyone else is probably feeling shy or nervous too. Remember, all of you (or almost all of you) are meeting each other for the first time, so it's bound to be a little awkward for anywhere between a few minutes and a few days, but things will get better as time goes by.
Don't forget that hello is the first word in a friendship. Say hello to someone. Both of you will be glad you did!

, Your counselors will probably play a few name games on the first day to get to know everyone. If this is the case, don't feel embarrassed or feel like these are games that you played in kindergarten (even if they are). Stand up and introduce yourself!


If you're going to have/get rid of a nickname, this is the time to do it. Introduce yourself by your real name, but then state what you want to be called. For example: ""Hi, I'm <insert name here>, but please, call me <insert desired nickname here>.""
If your counselors do not do introductions (but they probably will have some semblance of intros), introduce yourself to the people in your unit anyway. That way people will know who you are!

, This is a great way to de-stress and to get to know some of your camp-mates, and it's a great way to pass the time.

, It's not going to be easy (unless you are really, really good at falling asleep in new places), but try to get as much sleep as you can that first night. Even if you only get 10 - 20 minutes of shut-eye, every little bit counts and you'll be less tired the next day.

"
"
Make sure you grab some breakfast every day to keep you going.,
Check out some of the activities.,
Don't forget to eat lunch and dinner!,
Play a few more games when you get some down time!,
Make sure you get some sleep each night.",How to Have Fun at Summer Camp3," They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and it's true - if you eat a good breakfast, you'll have more energy to do the activities that you want to do.


You may run into the problem of a breakfast you don't like. While most camps will have multiple options and usually have cereal, sometimes you may find yourself out of luck. The best thing you can do is to try a little bit of everything, and you'll eventually find something you like.

, Most camps have activities like archery, canoeing, arts and crafts, and nature hikes, but many also have other, more non-traditional activities. Some may even have an activity involving computers! Make sure you sign up for something at every chance you get.


Whatever they have, Try to do one thing that you know you love and three things that you have never tried before. Who knows? you may find something you really, really love!
Whatever you do, it's going to be hot outside, so Try to go swimming at least once while you are at camp, if you can.
Make sure that you also have a bottle of water with you at all times so that you don't get dehydrated.

, You're likely doing a lot more physical activity than normal at camp, so making sure you eat three square meals a day is a must.


If you can, eat a little more than you normally do to make sure that you still have enough energy to keep you going!

, Usually, there is a lot of downtime while waiting for a spot in the showers, so play a few games with your camp friends to pass the time.


Singing camp songs is also a fun way to spend your spare time. They may be a little silly, but they're a good way to have a laugh and they're loads of fun!
If you have the supplies, you can use your down time to write letters home. Be sure to include some important things in your letter:

What you're doing at camp
Your favorite part of each day
What you're looking forward to tomorrow
Anything else you want to add



, Naturally you and your cabin/tent-mates will want to stay up talking (this is especially common with girls), but try, once again, to get at least a little bit of sleep each night so that you can be awake for the next day's activities.

"
"
Accept that this is the last day you will be at camp for a while.,
Gather the email addresses/phone numbers/addresses of camp friends you would like to stay in touch with.,
The day before you leave, pack your suitcase.,
When you go to sleep on that last night, think about all the fantastic memories you've made.,
Always be positive, and do not be a party pooper.",How to Have Fun at Summer Camp4," It's a sad truth for many, and some people do cry over this fact. Especially if you've had a lot of fun over the course of your stay, be prepared for a lot of strong emotions.

, Write them down somewhere you can hold onto them and keep track of them.

, Make sure you have everything that you brought with you in your suitcase, and if you can't find something, attempt to track it down before you leave.


Make sure you have a change of clothes, some pajamas, toiletries, and proper shoes, not to mention your bedclothes, left out for the final night, especially if they are gathering your luggage the night before.

, So you made a fantastic new friend, shot a perfect bulls-eye doing archery, or trotted on horseback for the first time? Great! Think about that. So you messed up what was going to be a perfect friendship bracelet but you still had fun anyway? That's great too! Reflect on your best (and occasionally worst but still fun) moments.

Do not, what ever you do, think about how much you'll miss being at camp. You will feel absolutely awful and you will have trouble falling asleep.

, Talk and be kind to everyone. The more friends you have then the better time you will have. Even if you dont have many friends still be positive and open-minded. Always follow the rules so you don't get in trouble. Nobody wants to be friends with someone who might get them in trouble."

Guinea Pig: This is perhaps the most important role to get the prank started.,
Frontman: The frontman is the person actually pulling off the prank.,
Flank: The flank is a highly important role involved in lookout and cover-up.",How to Organize an Efficient Prank at Camp1," The guinea pig has to be the stealthiest person in the group. He/she is the one that goes into the area that you are going to prank and checks to make sure that:


A. Nobody is awake/inside
B. There isn't anything in the way of the prank's success

The guinea pig should try to establish some form of inaudible communication, like a hand gesture or something of the sort which could indicate ""don't go in"" or ""it's safe.""

;
, He/she has to be fast and discreet while doing the prank, and be bold and skilled in the ways of practical joke-dom. There can be more than one frontman. The frontman continues on with the prank without hesitation, unless somebody sees him/her, or a flank tells him to stop.

, The flank always follows the frontman closely and looks out to see whether anyone is coming. There is always the golden rule of at least one flank to every frontman. If one person is found out, the whole prank is ruined, so make sure that they have your back.

Be enthusiastic — if you are excited about camp, the campers will be too.,
Be their friend —kids look up to their counselors, especially if there is less than a decade in age difference.,
Go out of your way to keep them happy — doing something simple like trading chips with them at lunch can make a camper’s day.,
Get to know each kid individually — camp cabins involve a mix of personalities and interests, and each one has different things they're willing to get excited about.,
Encourage inclusiveness—kids can be mean, preteens in particular.,
Create activities to build teamwork—games can be fun and enjoyable with any age group.,
Require safety but don’t be overbearing — the campers’ safety should be your number one goal.,
Be someone they can look up to—as previously stated, campers look up to their counselors as role models.,
Have fun—summer camp (or any camp for that matter) should be fun.",How to Get Kids Excited About Camp," Suggest some fun theme days for camp such as favorite hat day or mismatch day to get the kids involved.;
, If you are their friend they will want to come back day after day to build a relationship with you.

, You don’t have to bend over backwards to help them, but making an effort is a plus, and the kids will notice.

, Spend equal amounts of time with each one and get to know the activities they most enjoy. Don't pick favorites but consider what will work as a good compromise for each child.

, If you see that one camper is being left out of group activities, become buddies with him/her. This will show the kids that this camper is accepted socially and he/she will be more likely to be accepted into the group. If partners are needed for a game, be sure that you try to pick the kid who is normally left out as your partner and encourage the kids to make new friends.

, Games and challenges that build teamwork help the campers to feel like they belong in the group. Things as simple as all wearing an orange bandanna or the same color shirt help everyone to feel included.

, If a child is injured, it causes all sorts of problems for the camp and for you as a counselor. Make sure you enforce the rules set forth by the camp and other counselors equally. At the same time, make sure that the kids are still able to have a good time. Let them know that you can be safe and have fun.

, Young kids and even youth can be easily influenced by the example you set, so be sure it is one that you wouldn’t mind them imitating. If you don’t want them sharing with their parents how you spent last Saturday in bed with the worst hangover of your life, don’t bring it up. No one is perfect, so let them know that, but don’t share topics with them that aren't needed.

, The kids should leave exhausted everyday and telling their parents how amazing camp was that day. If you see them running around laughing and sporting a huge smile on their faces, then you have done your job. Make sure you have fun too—camp can be the most enjoyable job you’ll ever have, so embrace the time you have with your kiddos.

Find a boyfriend or a girlfriend.,
Be positive.",How to Live Through Your New Summer Camp," One of the benefits of a new summer camp is that nobody knows you. They don't know about that time you fell flat on your face and on your tray in the cafeteria and reeked of hamburgers and mustard for the rest of the long, long day.;
, Pretend you're the most popular person in your school and everyone already loves you. Don't actually say it (i.e. don't lie). Just feel it. People will probably fall for it and be drawn to your creativity and self-assurance.

, There are hundreds of people at camp and each one can be a friend. Camp friends can last your whole lifetime, so there is no way to emphasize how special they can be.

, You will need clothes for hot, wet, and cold weather; swimsuits; sunscreen and bug spray; pajamas; a raincoat; toiletries; an iPod and other things to entertain you; a flashlight; and potentially more. It's always best to be prepared. Don't worry about over-packing, because you will probably not return home with all the things you came with anyway.

, Before you leave, check the camp website and see if there's any useful information on it. Find someone who's been there a while to show you around the camp so you don't get lost on your first day. The more you know, the less overwhelming and confusing the experience will be.


If you're shy, it would be a good idea to head to camp with someone you know, like an old friend or neighbor or even a sibling. If you are worried or think you may get homesick, it's best to have a familiar face you can turn to.







, Find camp veterans who can teach you the way camp works and what to expect next. Don't be afraid to ask questions and get used to how things run. Each camp is unique and understanding yours will make everything less awkward.

, If people know who you are, they will be drawn to you and you will get respect and a wide circle of friends. Even being known as ""that kid with the earrings"" gives others something that makes you seem more familiar and approachable.

, You may meet people at camp who you have more in common with than the people in your own school. Dont rush but, If you have a special guy or girl you want to ask out, dance with, etc. just ask! Camp is a great place to foster relationships in a close-knit environment. Remember this is totally optional, and if you don't want to do this, there is no pressure.

, Summer camp doesn't last forever (unfortunately), and if you manage to botch things up this summer, you can always go to a different summer camp next year! If you give camp a fair chance, it may very well end up as the best experience of your life and you can learn more from it than you ever imagined possible.

Have your child grab a notepad and start taking a few notes about the subject. The more they practice the more they'll feel in school again.;
, or if they're learning on their own. This way, they not only know how to do the subject, but they have examples to back-up their theories, and they will feel like they're doing a lesson with their teacher.

, Like all teachers, homework is given at the end of the day. Help them do the work, and give them some example from today's class to see if they can recollect anything!Not only have you fulfill the child's appetite, you also just taught them a few things. How great!

, It's great they are keen to continue working but now is the best time to catch up on classmates and to polish up any subjects they did poorly in in their summer tests. Look up sites online or ask the teacher what areas need the most support.

, There are a wide variety of summer camps and day courses available for all age groups which particularly cater for languages. This is a fun way of letting your child enjoy themselves and meet new people, as well as polish up their grades. Ideally book a place on the course during the winter or early spring as the best courses will fill up quickly!

, Encourage a lifelong love of self-directed learning by letting your child choose books. Books on history, whether non-fiction or novels based on real events, and on science, baking and other subjects, are available in even the smallest library and may encourage children who do not enjoy studying a subject at school as the books are aimed at developing an interest in the subject, not achieving in exams. It is also a great opportunity to give children who excel in certain subjects the chance to develop their interest and abilities.

, They may have books or websites you could use and can guide you on what you child needs help with, as well as what areas they will be covering next year.

, To give your child a greater chance of doing well academically as they grow older, they will need to be surrounded by like minded peers. This is easier said than done but you can guide them towards making such friends by introducing them to some academic hobbies, such as book groups, speech and drama classes or summer courses. Encourage them to socialise.

Keep in mind that you'll only be at camp for eight or more weeks.,

Finished.

",How to Find a Girlfriend at Summer Camp," Therefore, it's best that you don't get too serious during those weeks. If you ever do see the girl again, it probably won't be for another year unless if special arrangements are made. Remember that asking a girl at camp to be your ""girl friend"" can be not only considered immature, but foolish and perhaps a little offensive. Developing a good connection with this girl and taking things slowly is more probable, reasonable, and mature. After all, it's best that you find out as much as you can about her over a long period of time rather than getting her basic information in order to accelerate the process of her becoming your girlfriend. Not only is it less likely she will agree if you move quickly, but it will also cause a distant relationship of not knowing her very well other than surface details. Don't walk into camp with the mindset that being speedy will get you further.;
, Make sure she has similar interests to you and that you think you will be able to carry on a good conversation with her one on one.

, Try to join conversations that discuss the girl you've chosen and find out as much as possible about her using the information you overhear, but don't eavesdrop. If you happen to overhear a private conversation. Listen politely and subtly, but stop listening at the appropriate times. Although people might not be aware that someone else is listening into their conversation, you know what you're doing, and you should respect their privacy, no matter how juicy the gossip may be.

, If you catch any of them glancing at you often, but they suddenly look away when you make eye contact, make a note to yourself about a possible match. This means she may be physically attracted to you, although she doesn't know you yet. It could be a sign of a possible relationship with her if you take the right steps in the right direction with this.


Never automatically assume that you'll have an easy time building relationships. Relationships may have their own struggles getting started, and they have the tendency to be delicate and easily fragile. Take things slowly while remembering that you only have till the end of summer camp to nurture this relationship till it blooms successfully.

, Go through each one's personality and pick at least five girls that may make a good match. Once you've selected your five, dig a little deeper and obtain a little more information about them by either asking around, politely listening into conversations at appropriate times (ex: during lunch), or personally talking to them. Then, you can compare all those personalities and bits of information to narrow it down to one girl you'll be focusing on till the end of summer camp.


If you're bold and confident in conversations with girls, talk to the girls yourself. This gives you an advantage because you'll be able to obtain your information from a reliable source - the girl herself - and you'll be able to ask additional questions that may help you narrow the choices down to one. Also, by starting a friendly conversation with the girls, you will have planted the seed for a relationship, and you won't be stuck with the troubles of introducing yourself while trying not to sound awkward.
If you're on the shy side with little or no confidence in conversations with girls, don't feel forced to talk to the girls yourself. Although your sources may be a little unsteady, gain information by asking other people who may know the girls. You can listen to conversations that happen to pass by you when you're around, and you may gain some valuable information. By doing this, you'll avoid talking to all the girls personally, and you may save some time, depending on how long it takes you to get enough information for you to decide which girl you want to be your girlfriend.

, Start as many friendly conversations with her as you like without being too annoying or clingy. Obtain as much information about her as possible during those conversations while nurturing your new friendship with her. Once you two have grown comfortable with each other and are close enough friends, flirt a little with her. However, keep it to an appropriate and low level - nothing too serious yet - or you may scare her off. The appropriate level of flirting will demonstrate that you have an attraction to her, and it also may confirm that she is attracted to you as well.


Keep an eye on her body language during your conversations with her. If she appears comfortable, eager to continue the conversation, and/or very responsive, those may be signs that she likes you. However, if she appears to be uncomfortable, eager to get away, and/or unresponsive, those may be signs that she doesn't like you.

Keep in mind that body language is not entirely stable enough for you to use as evidence to prove whether she likes you or not. Use it to help you a little, but you should never completely use it.


Make note of any times that she touches you for no reason or makes up excuses to touch you (ex: She touches your arm while laughing at a joke you just cracked). Also, watch her posture. Arms crossed across her chest may mean she doesn't like you, but remember it could also just be a habit of hers.

Keep in mind that her posture and the direction her feet are pointing in are not reliable enough for you to figure out whether she likes you or not. While they may be bonus points/extra information you could extract, they are not complete evidence.


Listen carefully to her responses towards your questions and/or contributions towards a conversation. If she answers willingly and her voice reveals eagerness and has no hints of boredom or disgust in it, those may be signs that she enjoys your company. However, if her answers are vague, and she seems reluctant to continue the conversation with you, those may be signs that she doesn't enjoy your company.

, This will hint to her that you're pleased with her and you have a possible attraction towards her. Also, it shows that you're open for a conversation with her. Bonus points for you if she smiles back and/or blushes. If she doesn't smile or blush, don't worry about it - she may be shy.

, Note whether most of the information is positive or not. If most of it falls on the positive side, you have a chance. If not, you may not have a chance. However, remember that this information is just extra proof and not the actual main part of the evidence. You shouldn't thoroughly rely on this, although the information could hint whether she likes you or not.

, If not, nurture it a little longer before pushing forward with this. However, keep in mind that you have a limited amount of time to make your move before it's too late. Although you may feel shy and a little nervous about this, remember that a lot of other boys have gone through this just like you, and you shouldn't let your fear take away your chance to be with her. If you're feeling uncertain about this, ask yourself this question: ""Why did you go this far with her only to turn back?""


Remember that if you never take a chance, be brave, and ask her whether she likes you or not, you'll never know the end results. They could be the exact opposite of what you expected or they could be exactly what you thought it would be. You never know till you try.
Tell yourself that you have twenty seconds of crazy courage to get through this. Use those seconds wisely and push through it. You'll be surprised at how brave you were to do this.
It's fine to be nervous and a little afraid about asking her whether she likes you or not, but it's not okay to let the fear completely take control of you and restrain you from doing what you want. A lot of people are afraid like you when it comes to this point, but not all of them make it through. Why? Because they let their fear tell them what to do. Prove yourself and show that you're not afraid by doing this!
Even if the girl rejects you, you should be proud of yourself for having enough courage to ask her. That is already a huge accomplishment, and you should gain confidence and knowledge through this. You have come so far, and you should be glad you were the one to lead this relationship through the journey the whole way.

, If you two aren't already alone, ask her if you can talk to her in a secluded area, but make sure she is comfortable with it so that she knows you aren't going to violate her. Admit to her that you have feelings for her. Then, ask her if she feels the same way about you, but add that if she doesn't, it's fine and you two can still be friends if it's fine with her.


If she admits that she holds feelings for you as well, ask her if she wants to be your girl friend.

If she accepts, congratulations! You've achieved your goal, but remember that the journey isn't over. You still have a long way to go if you want to do your best at getting this relationship to grow beautifully. Give it your very best and put her first. Don't cheat on her or do anything to make her upset. Respect her.
If she declines, she may not be ready to take things so seriously yet, despite the fact that she may have feelings for you. This is understandable, and make sure she knows that you understand and respect her decision. Don't be upset, but kindly let her know that you can wait till she is ready. This will make her look up to you, and she may admire you even more for being so mature. Once this is over, know that you two like each other and fulfill your promise: wait for her to be ready.


If she doesn't like you, it's fine. Take it easy and don't lose your control. Tell her that it's okay, and you would still like to be friends with her if it's fine with her. Don't immediately dump her and run after another girl with desperateness because that shows her you are immature and she was even more right in not liking you. Be a good friend towards her and treat her with good respect. She might change her mind in the end and find that she actually holds feelings for you. There's still a possible chance.

If the idea of camp is yours rather than theirs, broach the subject casually by asking them to think about what they would expect from a fun camp. Allow them some time to think it over so they don’t feel compelled to answer for the sake of answering., Create a list of their favorite activities. Mark their most favorite to see if there are any camps devoted exclusively to this subject. If not, use your list to find a camp whose programs cover the majority of your child’s interests. These may include:Sports
Art and music
Math and science
Religion
Outdoor/nature activities

, Determine the length of your child’s stay. Decide between sending them to camp for a few hours each day and for whole weeks at a time. If you decide on a day camp, increase your options by also considering other institutions that offer summer programs. Such institutions include:Activity centers
Churches
Colleges and universities
Fine art centers
Municipalities
Museums
Zoos

, Some camps may offer bus transportation to designated drop-off/pick-up sites outside of camp to minimize the distance that parents need to travel.For day camps, extend your search a little wider than you can personally drive each day and ask about provided transportation when you contact the camp. For overnight camps, extend your search over an even greater area since you will have to make the trip less frequently.Local day camps will probably offer a limited variety of locales. Still, ask your child where their ideal camp would be located. Would they prefer the deep woods? Do they imagine it situated by a river, lake, bay, or ocean? Or is the location less important than the facilities and activities provided?

, Refer to the criteria that you and your child have established. Add your child’s age as well as your budget to the list. Perform a keyword search to find prospective camps that meet your criteria (example: “overnight nature camps in upstate New York” or “basketball day camps in Southern California”).Or, visit websites that perform the search for you based on your entered input, such as:find.acacamps.org (the American Camp Association)
www.camps.com
www.kidscamps.com
www.summercamps.com

, Treat finding a summer camp like applying to colleges. Compose a list of your top picks. Give yourself some fallbacks in the event that your top pick is all booked up for the summer. Additionally, determine your child’s top pick by presenting them with three camps that focus on their interests with different approaches. For example, if your child is eager to learn outdoor/nature skills, ask them to decide between:An overnight camp set in the deep woods that focuses exclusively on this subject.
An overnight camp that offers other activities, as well as field trips into town, so they can get a breather from this one subject.
A local day camp that focuses on outdoor/nature skills but allows your child to return home at night.

, Get a sense of what a day there is really like by taking a tour while it is in full swing. If the camp only runs summer-long sessions, pay a visit the preceding summer. If they run multiple sessions throughout the summer, go during a preceding session. Note the following:The mood of the kids
The enthusiasm of the staff
The staff’s supervisory and safety skills
How many children are assigned to one counselor

, Make sure the camp is equipped to handle any special needs your child may have regarding food, health, or handicaps.Take a careful look at the conditions to make sure they match the brochure’s photographs. Measure their adequacy versus your child’s concerns and personal goals. For example:


If your child isn’t too thrilled about a down-to-earth, rustic experience, make sure the campers’ cabins have reliable air-conditioning and leak-proof roofs.
If the aim is for your child to develop particular skills in, say, computer science or tennis, check the quality of the equipment to make sure they won’t be using out-of-date computers or worn-out rackets.

, Expect many camps to have a specific mission or underlying philosophy. Have a conversation with the director about the camp’s goals, even if their promotional material mentions it. Be aware that faith-based camps may still emphasize core concepts of their faith even though they accept campers from outside the faith or downplay their church’s sponsorship in their brochure. Camps may emphasize:Strong interaction, camaraderie, and community-building between campers.
Leadership and self-reliance
Competition

, Consider this an excellent litmus test of the camp’s quality. Ask the director how many of the same children return year after year. Time your visit to coincide with the first day of camp or Parents Day, when other parents will be on hand. Find those parents whose children are similar to your own and ask about their experiences. For instance:If the camp specializes in certain activities, have their kids shown significant progress in developing those skills?
Have their children had issues with others at camp? If so, did the staff handle the situation effectively?
Did their children enjoy participating in other activities even if they weren’t their strong suit?

, Whether the camp supervises your child overnight or only during the daytime, ease your mind by making sure the camp has received accreditation from the American Camps Association or a similar advisory board.Double-check with local authorities to see if the camp has passed all required safety and health inspections.Ensure that your child will be well cared for in your absence.


Such accreditation only applies to actual camps, rather than summer programs run by museums, fine art centers, and the like.

, Expect one camp’s base fee to differ from another’s in terms of what is covered. Ask the director for a complete list of additional charges that you will have to pay on top of the base fee. Additionally, ask if your child will need hard cash on hand for onsite canteens or off-site excursions. Extra fees may include:Clothing and/or equipment
Insurance
Meals
Transportation

, Find out if the camp offers any specials that may reduce their usual base fee. Ask if they offer any scholarships (sometimes called “camper ships”) that your child may qualify for based on your income. If not, check for any alternate discounts that may be offered. These could include:Early enrollment
Group discounts
Referrals

, After you establish the total price for summer camp, determine whether you can afford it on top of the expense of any programs that your child (or entire family) take part in during the school year. If not, consider enrolling your child or family in annual memberships that include summer programs or offer deeper discounts for them. Such organizations may include:The Boys & Girls Club
The Boy & Girl Scouts
Fine art centers
Museums
The YMCA

, These can be pop songs everyone knows, or ones you made up at a get-together. Make them your theme songs while at camp. You will sing them a thousand times every day, and during the year you can sing them for some good memories.

, Find shapes in the clouds and patterns in the trees. Take some time at night to stare at the stars and tell stories. Look for a constellation or a planet. Watch the sun set and the moon rise.

, Chances are there is a deer living behind your cabin, raccoons on a hiking trail, birds' nests up in the dining room rafters, or a snake tanning on the rocks by the lake. You can observe and draw or take photos, but remember to not scare any of them away. It is their home too!

, Paint a chair or decorate a doorway, or sign your name on a bench or your bed. There's nothing better than coming back to camp and seeing your artwork being shown to the world; it will bring back so many memories for you and others.

, There's nothing like a nice campfire and some marshmallows after a long day of busy camp games. Make sure to pick a safe place to do this. You may start a competition to see who can build a fire and roast their marshmallow first, or gather everyone around to share some food and good memories. This is also the ideal time to lean in and give a dramatic re-telling of the camp ghost legend...

, Chances are your mom will ask what you ate every day or what games you played. If you have it recorded there is no worries of forgetting anything, and years later you can see things you wrote about that you may have completely forgotten.

, Everyone knows how to play cards and it's a great way to bond. A fun round of cards in the cabin is great for a rainy day.

, You may make some really great friends and learn some amazing things. Who knows, maybe your bunk mate will be the next superstar someday!

, Write a couple letters. They will love to hear from you and know that you are having fun. Families may get worried if they don't hear from you, and friends may miss you most of all. Find the time to send something to them to let them know how you're doing.

, They are the closest thing to family you have because they have lived with you, yet are also undeniably great friends who you can depend on. It's great to have a laugh every once in a while of that great prank you pulled, and just let each other know how you're doing.

If there are any free camp brochures, those are useful too. If you know anyone who goes to (or has gone to) the same camp, ask them questions. Get your parents' help in calling or emailing the camp director with any questions that you haven't been able to find the answers to.;
, Look at the packing list provided for your camp and bring what it lists, perhaps maybe even more. It is actually not a bad idea to ""overpack"". At camp, because you will be living in a cabin with several other people, things get lost and swapped around quite frequently. Don't be shy about putting in the things you will want to have with you, in addition to what is required. Pack all of your heavy gear in a suitcase or duffel bag, and bring smaller personal items in a backpack. Often you will need the help of another person or two to carry it to and from vehicles.

, Traveling to camp comes in many forms. Many kids take the camp bus, which picks up kids at a designated meeting spot. The camp bus is much more fun than you may think. It's an excellent way to meet people ahead of time, and many of the kids who ride the bus are long-time campers who can answer your questions or tell stories. Some traditional camps provide long train rides to get there; still other people who live far away from their camp choose to take an airplane. If you are simply riding in the car with your parents, the drive is a good time to relax and pull yourself together.

,, Your bed will be your personal ""home base"" for the summer, so choose what you feel most comfortable with. The top is very good if you like space, but the bottom is warmer. Both are excellent for decorating and fun gatherings. Consider whether you will want a bed close to the entrance, bathroom, or some other important landmark. Sometimes there are beds already assigned for you by counselors. If you are not arriving for the first session, many good beds will already be claimed. Above all, when it comes to beds remember that you will often have to settle for something that isn't your first choice.

, Follow the staff's instructions on what to do next.

, Some camps may have an orientation where they lead all the new campers around for a tour and introductions. Others have staff come to meet you when you get off the bus and then lead you straight to your cabin. Whatever the process is, pay attention to what you are told, so you can start getting used to your surroundings.

, This is the simplest thing to remember but also the most important. You will be living with them for the next two or more weeks, and there are bound to be people who you click with and maybe some you don't. People who are in your cabin at camp can be your lifelong friends if you give them a chance. Strong, long-term camp friendships start with the people in your cabin, who you spend the most time with.

, You never know how nice people can be unless you try! There will be chances to meet kids outside of your cabin and you can make dozens of long-time pals this way. It is good to know a variety of people at camp and remember as many names and faces as you can. If your camp is co-ed, don't be afraid of befriending people of the opposite gender. Friends in other cabins can share insights with you that you never experience in your own cabin.

, There will be plenty of new experiences at camp, and you are definitely going to like at least a few of them! Everybody has activities that they like and dislike, so find things that you enjoy and people with whom you share interests. At camp you get to try new things that you may never have the chance to do otherwise. Fearlessly being a part of everything will make you the happiest camper you can be.

, This cannot be stressed enough. Camp is fun because of the people you experience it with. Say hello with a smile and take younger kids under your wing. Find counselors you can trust, learn who lives in which cabin, and get familiar with all the popular hangout spots. Take as many notes and photographs as you can and save all your souvenirs for life.

, This isn't for everyone, but if you're a bit of a prankster, you can have some fun at camp.


Ask your counselor about a prank before you try it. They can make sure all camp rules are being followed.
Choose leaders, one from each side. The two will discuss additional ground rules and make sure all pranks are pulled in the best possible manner. Consider an experienced camper, a prankster with a friendly outlook, or the person who is the sneakiest.
When pulling pranks, remember that the other side will retaliate equally. If ground rules are broken, trust is often hurt. Remember that camp is fun and pranks should be fun, not hurtful. A good prank war builds friendships between everyone involved and is lots of fun!

, On the last day of camp, exchange e-mail, addresses, phone numbers, and/or screen names with all your camp friends so you can keep in touch.


Some camps send out a directory, which is very useful. Save the directories you get every year.
If you all plan to return to camp next summer, communicate as often as you can to keep tabs on how things are going in your lives. Try to get together for birthdays, holidays, and other special events. Don't make the mistake of forgetting about each other during the school year.

Refrigerate any unused eggs.",How to Make Salted Eggs," Rinse the eggs under cool, running water while using your fingers to gently scrub away any dirt or debris. Dry the eggs with clean paper towels.


While cleaning the eggs, inspect the shells for cracks. Discard any cracked eggs and keep the whole eggs.
Duck eggs are preferred over chicken eggs for this recipe, but either will work. Duck eggs have tougher shells, and the yolks are both larger and oilier than those of chicken eggs. All of these traits can improve the taste and texture of the salted eggs.;
, Bring extra water to a boil inside a kettle, then pour the water into the container you plan to use for the salted eggs.


Glass or ceramic containers work best, and the container should also have a lid. You can also use multiple containers; for instance, you could use two or three 1-pint (500-ml) glass canning jars.
If the container will crack under intense heat, do not sterilize it with boiling water. Clean it with warm water and soap instead, rinsing well to remove any residue.

, Carefully stack the clean eggs in the clean jar. Be gentle to avoid cracking the shells.


Try to leave at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of empty head space in between the eggs and the top of the jar. You can have more empty space than that, but if there's less empty space, the brine may not cover the eggs adequately well once you add it.

, Pour 5 cups (1.25 L) of water into a medium saucepan. Set it on the stove over medium heat and bring the water to a full boil.

, Gradually add the salt to the boiling water, stirring after each addition. Dissolve the full amount of salt in the water before continuing.The goal is to fully saturate the water with salt. In other words, the water should become so salty that additional salt will no longer dissolve.
If you are unable to dissolve some of the salt after adding it, do not add any more, even if you haven't used the full amount yet.

, If you wish to add spices to the brine, do so now. Star anise and Szechuan peppercorns are the most traditional.Adding spices to the brine can give the salted eggs a richer taste.
You could add other spices alongside the star anise and peppercorns, too. Red chili peppers, garlic, ginger, cinnamon sticks, and whole black cardamoms are among some of the most popular choices.
If you don't have any of these spices, you could also use 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of your favorite tea leaves. The egg shells will deepen in color if you take this option.

, Remove the brine from the heat and allow it to cool to room temperature.


Do not pour hot brine over the raw eggs. Doing so could cause the egg shells to crack.

, If you wish to add the Shaoxing wine, do so now. Stir well to fully distribute the wine throughout the brine.


Adding the wine to the brine will enhance the taste while changing the yolk to an orange-red color. It should also mask the odor of the eggs while restricting the growth of bacteria. This step isn't strictly necessary, though.

, Pour the cooled brine solution over the eggs in the jar. The brine must cover the eggs completely.


If the brine does not cover the eggs, top off the containers with additional room temperature water.
Leave at least 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.6 to 1.25 cm) of empty head space in between the surface of the brine and the top edge of the jar.

, Some of the eggs may float the top of the brine as the eggs sit. To keep the eggs submerged throughout the entire process, place a sealed plastic bag filled with additional water on top of the eggs.


Some people prefer to use a small plate to weigh down the eggs, which may also work well. If you choose that option, pick a relatively light plate to avoid crushing the eggs on accident.
If the lid of the container sits relatively deep, it alone might be enough to keep the eggs submerged, especially if the eggs and brine nearly fill the container to the top.

, Cover the container with its lid and let the eggs sit at room temperature for about 15 minutes.During this time, the brine should begin permeating the shells of the eggs. It will be easier for this process to start while the eggs are still at room temperature.

, Place the jar in a cool location and keep it there for about one month.


A refrigerator, cellar, or cool garage would work well.
Some recipes recommend cool storage, but others recommend room temperature storage. Cool storage can help preserve the eggs for a longer period, but either method could work.

, After 28 to 30 days pass, remove one egg and test it. You can test the egg raw or cooked.


If you use chicken eggs instead of duck eggs, you may need to test an egg after the first three weeks instead of waiting until after the fourth.
To test the egg raw, crack it open and examine the yolk. It should be firm and darker in color than a standard raw yolk would be. If the yolk runs, the remaining eggs will need additional brining time.
To test the egg cooked, hard boil the egg before breaking it open. The yolk should be deep in color, very oily, and very salty. If you'd prefer saltier eggs, give the remaining eggs additional brining time.

, If the eggs are not ready yet, seal the container again and continue storing them for another week or so.


You can brine the eggs up to 50 days, but you shouldn't let them sit out beyond that period of time.Longer brining times will result in saltier egg whites and oilier egg yolks.

, When the salted eggs have the taste and texture you prefer, remove them from the brine and rinse the eggs under cool, running water.


Dry the eggs with clean paper towels and transfer them to a clean egg carton.
Discard the leftover brine.

, If you'd like to eat the salted eggs on their own, you should boil the eggs in water before consumption.


To boil the eggs:

Place the eggs into a large saucepan and cover them with cool water.
Place the pan on the stove over medium heat. Bring the water to a boil.
After 1 minute, turn off the heat and cover the saucepan. Allow the eggs to continue cooking for a total of 20 minutes, or until they reach your desired level of doneness.
Cool the boiled eggs under cold water.



, If you'd rather not eat the eggs plain, you can use raw salted eggs in many traditional Chinese recipes.


Consider using the salted eggs when making moon cakes or rice dumplings. You can also cook the salted eggs by mixing them into stir-fries, congee, or soup.

, Raw salted eggs can be safely stored in the refrigerator for up to one month. Boiled salted eggs can be refrigerated up to one week.

Consider the cooking time for individual ingredients.,
Cut all the ingredients to the same size.,
Season the dish every step of the way.,
Focus on soups and stews.",How to Make One Pot Camping Meals1," The key to pulling off a one pot meal is knowing when to add each ingredient so it cooks properly. Some foods, such as large cuts of meat, root vegetables, or brown rice, take longer to cook, which means they should be added to the pot first. Ingredients that cook quickly should be added last.Cutting meat into small pieces can help it cook more quickly.
Root vegetables include carrots, onion, garlic, parsnips, and turnips.
Tender greens, such as spinach or arugula, cook quickly so they can be added near the end.
Herb and spices can be added near the end of the cooking process.;
, Food is more likely to cook at the same rate if the pieces are the same size. When you chop up your vegetables or cut your meat into pieces, try to keep them an uniform size so their cooking times are similar.The smaller that you cut the ingredients, the shorter that the cooking time will be. It may take a little longer to prep the food for cooking, but you won't have to stand over the pot as long.

, When you're making a one pot meal, the flavors can easily be diluted each time you add a new ingredient. To ensure that you have the most flavorful meal possible, add a little salt and pepper to taste each time you mix in a new ingredient.You can mix in other seasonings that you like, such as cayenne pepper or Italian seasoning, depending on what dish you're making.
It's a good idea to taste the dish as you go, so you know exactly how much seasoning it needs.

, The easiest way to ensure a successful one pot meal for your camping trip is to stick to soups and stews. Most of those recipes are designed to be made in a single pot, so you can follow along without having to make adjustments.Chili recipes usually work well for one pot meals as well.

, After you’ve mixed in the cheeses, add the drained spinach and ½ cup (75 g) of finely chopped ham to the bowl. Gently fold them in until they are fully incorporated.You can add other vegetables to the quiche if you like. Peppers, tomatoes, and onions are tasty options.
You can substitute another cooked meat for the ham if you prefer. Bacon and pepperoni are good options.

, Place a skillet on your camping stove, and add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of vegetable oil. Allow the oil to heat on medium until it begins to shimmer, which should take 3 to 5 minutes.You can substitute olive oil or butter for the vegetable oil if you prefer.

, Once the oil is heated, add the egg mixture to the skillet. Make sure to spread it evenly across the pan., When the egg mixture is in the skillet, cover it. Reduce the heat to low, and allow the quiche to cook until the bottom is brown and crusty, which should take approximately 10 minutes.Make sure that the center of the quiche is set before you remove it from the heat.

, When the quiche is finished cooked, take the skillet off the heat. Allow it to cool for 5 minutes before cutting it into wedges and serving."

Brown the chicken in olive oil.,
Mix in the red pepper and saute until it is soft.,
Stir in the sun dried tomatoes and rice and cook until the rice browns.,
Add the stock and bring the mixture to a boil.,
Cook the mixture until the chicken and rice are cooked through.,
Garnish the dish with parsley and season with salt and pepper before serving.",How to Make One Pot Camping Meals4," Place a large, heavy-bottomed pot on your camping stove. Add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil and 4 chicken breasts with the skin and bone still in place, and heat them over medium-high until the chicken is golden brown, which should take 2 to 3 minutes per side.For the most flavorful dish, season both sides of the chicken breasts with salt and pepper before you brown them.

, Once the chicken is golden brown, add 1 red pepper that’s been julienned to the pot. Allow the pepper to cook until it becomes soft, which should take 1 to 2 minutes.You can substitute yellow peppers for the red if you prefer.

, When the pepper is soft, add ¼ cup (60 ml) of chopped, sun dried tomatoes and 1 ½ cups (350 ml) of Arborio rice to the pot. Mix well to combine them with the other ingredients, and cook the mixture for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the rice is slightly browned.You can substitute olives for the sun dried tomatoes if you prefer.
You can substitute another short-grain rice for the Arborio if you prefer.

, Once the rice is slightly browned, pour 3 cups (700 ml) of chicken stock to the pot. Allow the mixture to come to a boil, which should take 5 to 7 minutes., When the mixture has come to a boil, lower the heat to medium-low. Continue cooking the mixture until the chicken is cooked through and the rice is tender, which should take approximately 25 to 35 minutes.Be sure to stir the mixture occasionally as it cooks so the rice doesn’t stick to the pot.

, When the chicken and rice are finished cooking, remove the pot from the stove. Sprinkle some parsley and salt and pepper to taste over the dish, and serve while it’s warm.If you prefer, you can substitute basil for the parsley.

Allow the oil to heat on medium-high until it begins to shimmer, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes., Once the oil is heated, add 1 small, minced onion to the pot. Let the onion cook until it is translucent, which should take 1 to 3 minutes., When the onion is translucent, add ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of garlic powder to the mixture. Stir well, and let the mixture cook until it is fragrant, which should take approximately 1 minute.If you prefer, you can use 2 minced cloves of garlic in place of the garlic powder.

, After the mixture has become fragrant, add a 14.5-ounce (411 g) can of diced tomatoes, a 14.5-ounce (411 g) can of chicken broth, ½ tablespoon (1 g) of dried basil, 1 tablespoon (6 g) of Italian seasoning, and ½ pound (227 g) of pasta to the pot. Mix well to ensure that all of the ingredients are combined.You can use any type of pasta that you like for the dish.
Don’t worry if the liquid doesn’t cover the pasta completely right away. As it cooks, the sauce will thicken and cover the pasta.

, Once the ingredients are mixed, place the lid on the pot. Allow the mixture to come to a boil, which should take 10 to 15 minutes., When the mixture has come to a boil, take the lid off the pot. Continue to cook the mixture until the pasta is tender but still has some bite.The best way to determine if the pasta is done cooking is to taste it and see if you are happy with the texture.

, Once the pasta is finished cooking, spoon the pasta into two bowls. Top the bowls with a handful of parmesan cheese and fresh basil, and serve while it’s still warm."

Repeat the previous two steps until covered.
,

Now is the time for the paper.,

Stand it on the stand, directing to the sun.",How to Make a Solar Oven  from an Old Antenna Dish," Make sure it's in ok condition.
, You'll need the dish, aluminum foil, insulation (e.g. newspaper), black paper, a stand, and some tape., Fold up your insulation so it's a triangle that's the shape of one of the ribs. Tape it together., Make sure it's flat! Otherwise it will not reflect as well. Put it (shiny side up) on the insulation and tape or glue it to the satellite.,, Tape the black paper to the outside of the dish. (This step is actually optional, so skip it if you don't want it.), You now can cook all the food you want using the focus on the sun."
"
Get a can that is large, both somewhat tall and wide.,
Decide whether you want your stove to have a bottom, a top, both, or neither (being essentially a ring with some holes around the top and bottom).,
Peel any labels off of the can and wash it well.,
Cut the fuel door/bottom vent, a rectangular hole in the side at the bottom, with about one-fourth of the height and one-sixth of the circumference of the can.,
Make the smoke vents.,
For a stove without a top, you may want to install some kind of support for a cooking vessel (a small one, such as a can slightly smaller than the stove) so that it can sit above the fire but slightly inside the rim for stability.,
To use your stove, build a fire inside the stove (or, if it has no bottom, on the dirt under the stove) using matches and tinder.,
To grill something on a stove with a top, test its heat first by throwing droplets of water onto the top.,
To boil something on a stove without a top, put a vessel on top of the stove.,
The heat can be high and uneven.",How to Make a Tin Can Camp Stove (Hobo Stove)," A coffee can, particularly a three-pound coffee can, or a gallon commercial food can would be perfect. Width is particularly important if you want to use a cooking vessel on your can rather than just grill on it.;
,


If your stove has a bottom, you can load it with fuel and then set it in its final position. If your stove has no bottom, you'll have to load it in its final position or set it over a stack of fire materials on the ground, and not shift it as you add fuel.
If your stove has a top, you can cook on it directly as a grill, and soot will not accumulate as heavily on cookware. If your stove has no top, it will be more efficient with pots, pans and other cooking vessels because the hot gases will touch them directly and not be insulated by an air gap. You can also warm yourself near it with the top off; it should radiate more efficiently though less powerfully than an open fire because it is not cooled by an excessive amount of air pulled in at the bottom. (Don't burn yourself or expose your face to the rising smoke, which might contain sparks from time to time.)
If you want your stove to have a bottom and a top, find one that has a solid bottom and top, not a peel-off top like some coffee cans, and remove its original contents not by opening an end, but by punching a hole in the side near an end (which is easiest if the original contents are liquid or granular). This hole will be enlarged to form the fuel door. Choosing which end to make the hole near, designating it as the bottom, follows.

, Leave no flammable paper or glue on the can. (These would burn or scorch on the first use; a little residue is fine.) Make sure that the can has one end intact, and one end completely gone (unless you're making a stove with a top and a bottom). If necessary, finish removing one end with a can opener. Use the more-common kind of can opener which leaves a smooth can rim and a sharp removed lid, not the kind which leaves the rolled lip on the lid and makes the can sharp.

, A nice finishing touch would be to extend the cuts for this a little past the hole, and roll the edges in and back flush a fraction of the inch to reduce sharp edges (use a pliers).


If you're making a stove with a top, open at the bottom: Turn the can upside down, so that the open end is down. Cut a rectangle out of the can, cutting through the rim. Detach and discard the rectangle.
If you're making a stove with a bottom, open at the top: Make the hole at or very close to the bottom. Use a nail (a big framing nail) or punch to make starting hole(s), then finish cutting with a tinsnips, diagonal cutters, or similar.
If you're making a stove with a bottom and a top: Proceed as with making a stove with a bottom, after deciding which end you want to be the bottom of the stove (and draining the contents through a hole you made near it). If you make the end with the rim (normally the top of a can) the bottom, then the top will be rimless and seamless, which could be nice for grilling. If you make the end without the rim (normally the bottom of a can) the bottom, then the top will have a rim, which would be nice for cooking with smaller cans (though that practice is inefficient; use a topless stove with a cooking vessel).

, Turn the can around to the side opposite your rectangle. In the upper half near the closed top of your stove/can, punch lots of holes, using a hammer and fairly large nail. Brace the can securely somewhere that does not involve your hands (such as against a concrete step, driving diagonally into it). Make as many holes as will fit about 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch apart, in that top half of the back of your stove. If you're making a can without a top, avoid distorting the can by pounding into it. You might support the can on something inanimate and sturdy, such as a log, extended into it so that it doesn't tend to flatten.

, One kind could be a few parallel metal rods, such as coat-hanger pieces, passed through holes at a given level a little below the top and bent over at the ends so they stay in place.A very efficient design, although complicated to make, might have a bottom, and a top in which a hole is cut to wrap around a smaller can/cooking vessel, which is supported off the fire but not quite at the top of the big can so that it is surrounded by hot smoke, whose heat it has a large area and long time to conduct. If you make something like this, be sure to roll the sharp edges.

, Build the fire on a piece of ground with no grass or other flammable material. Clear a space around the fire as well. There should be nothing but dirt in the vicinity of your fire. Gather a supply of twigs to feed your fire. Then, once the fire is going, place your stove over the fire. The rectangle gives you an entrance to blow on the fire or to feed it twigs, while smoke should escape through the holes in the back.

, When they steam off, try frying an egg or heating up something on the surface of your stove.

, These stoves are top-heavy so don't boil a large quantity, use a tall vessel, or one with a long handle to reduce the risk of it falling over and of burns if it does fall over. A slightly-wider can, whose corrugated bottom will tend to make it stay put, or a pan with a curved or rough bottom would be good.


If you put in supports, set a small can on the supports.

, It will probably mark and may cause surface damage to cookware. Don't use fancy pots and pans. Consequently, the heat will not be evened out by the cookware. At least at first, don't try to make thick soups or other things prone to scorching.

Read up on your camp’s policies.,
Think about your theme.,
Embellish your trunk.,
Pick wall decorations.,
Pack your bedding.,
Throw in some permanent markers.,
Bring an instant camera.,
Choose your bunk.,
Make your bed.,
Place essential items close by.,
Decorate!,
Use the rafters.",How to Decorate a Camp Bunk Bed," Decorating your bunk is a time-honored tradition. However, because many cabins are old or delicate, your camp may have specific rules about what you can and cannot do to embellish your space.Make sure you know these, because it’d be a shame to have to abandon a cute decorating idea after you’ve already packed it.


Candles and incense are never okay. Save it for the campfire!
Some other frequently forbidden items are electrical items (like fans or string lights) and tapestries.;
, You don’t need to have a ton of perfectly matched bunk accessories straight out of a PBTeen catalog. However, keeping your decor to one theme can keep it cohesive and cool. You can use your favorite colors as a theme, or celebrate your favorite interests (like your favorite bands or comics)., If you have an old-fashioned traveling trunk, you’re lucky: it’s a storage unit and a cute piece of furniture at the same time.It can also add a lot to your decor if you want it to.


Ask your parents if you can decorate the trunk with stickers, glitter, or paint. If they’re concerned about damaging the trunk, try using vinyl stickers--these are great because they peel off easily. You can find them in stores marked as “wall art” or “mirror art.”
If your parents don’t want you to use stickers or paint, add a sweet touch to your trunk by threading ribbons in your favorite color through the handles. These will also make it easier to identify your belongings in a sea of black boxes.

, Photos and posters add a lot to your space, and because they’re flat, they’re easy to pack. Pictures of your friends and family remind you of home, a flyer from your favorite band can be a talking point with new friends, and a print of your favorite Monet painting is soothing and pretty.Make sure you know how you plan to attach these items to the wall! Masking tape and painter’s tape hold well and come away easily.
Vinyl mirror stickers or art can be used on the walls.
For extra cuteness points, make bunting in your favorite prints.
Colorful ribbons are a nice way to add texture--you can tie them to pretty much anything.

, Some camps provide sheets and pillows for you, and you can often bring extras if you really want to. Camp bunks usually have twin mattresses, so if you have a twin at home, those sheets and blankets will fit.


A couple of throw blankets (like the kind you put on your couch) can dress up your bed, just like layering an outfit makes it look better. Fold them neatly to add a sophisticated touch. Throw pillows are also adorable, but they can take up space when you pack.
If you want to bring your favorite stuffed animal, go ahead--it will look cute sitting on your bed.

, Some camps have a spot where campers traditionally sign their names and the years they attended camp. If (and only if!) your camp has such a tradition, a Sharpie is the perfect pen to use. You can also use pens for artwork, t-shirt signings, and writing down your contact information for new friends.

, Lots of camps ban electronics, so you won’t be able to Instagram your s’mores. However, instant cameras are usually allowed.The pictures you take with one will make excellent decorations when you’re at camp and great memories when you’re done., Different camps have different policies for how to choose your bunk. You might also have a bed assigned to you. Don’t worry too much about it, though. Whether you end up with the top or bottom bunk, you can still make it cute.The top bunk is nice because it’s fun to be so far off the floor, and you don’t have to worry about banging your head on the bunk above you.
The bottom bunk is also good, because it’s easy to get up in the middle of the night or convert it into a changing room. Just tuck a big dry towel into the top bunk’s mattress, and it will act like a big curtain.

, Your bunk itself is the most important place for you in the cabin, so set it neatly when you move in. Use hospital corners to keep your sheets smooth. Once you’ve put all your pillows and blankets on your bed, you can start with the fun part: arranging your other belongings.

, Before you start decorating, store important stuff like a clock, flashlight, lantern, or sunscreen on the shelf or cubby closest to your bed. This way, you can grab them easily before you go off on camp adventures. You can survive a few hours without your posters up, but forgetting bug spray even once might make you itchy for days., This is the fun part. If you have any favorite pictures or posters, put those up first, then arrange smaller pictures around them. Use masking or gaffer’s tape to securely attach your decorations. Tie bunting or colorful ribbons on the posts of the bunkbed.


Take off your shoes if you’re sitting on your bed to put up your pictures. Otherwise, you’ll be sleeping under a dirty blanket for all of camp, which is not cute.
If your bunkmates ask if they can help, say yes. It’s a great way to bond.
Don’t be shy about helping them out either--lend out your tape if you have extra, or offer to hang high pictures if you’re tall.

, If they are thick and close enough to you, they can be extra storage or a new surface for ornaments or flags. If it’s okay at your camp, they also look amazing wrapped with string lights. What could be better than a bunk that looks good literally from top to bottom?

Wear cotton and natural fibers.,
Stick with light colors.,
Wear loose clothing that allows airflow.,
Pay attention to your underwear.,
Change your clothes daily.",How to Dress at Summer Camp1," These are much more breathable than synthetic (manmade) fibers, which means air can move through them more easily. When it’s hot, you want as much air to move through your clothes as possible. Linen is another natural fiber like cotton.Polyester is a fabric that you definitely want to avoid during the summer. Rayon is another one that will heat you up.
Natural fibers tend to be a little tougher too, which is great for the wear and tear of camp. Cotton tends to wash easier than other fibers as well.
If you need to wear dress clothes for a dance or special event, it’s a good time to choose cotton dresses, skirts, and button up shirts over other fabrics.
Cotton isn’t just for your shirts, as many shorts, capris, and pants are also made of cotton.;
, You’ve always heard that black clothing absorbs more sunlight, so it will cause you to get hotter. Summer camp tends to include a lot of time out in the sun, and wearing lots of dark colors will mean being even hotter. White and gray are usually good options.If you tend to wear t-shirts with large graphics, the thickness of some graphics will also make you hot faster. Stick to shirts with less printing on them.
Since white does show dirt more easily, maybe light shades of other colors like blue, yellow and red will be better if there’s a chance you’ll get dirty.

, Tight clothes tend to cling to your skin as you get sweaty, which keeps air from flowing between your skin and clothes. Wearing clothes that fit loosely will let them move around more and let air flow through, keeping you cooler.You don’t want to wear clothes that are too big, so find the balance there. You could wear one size bigger than usual, as long as it doesn’t seem like it’s falling off of you.
It’s also good to wear clothing made of thinner material that won’t feel heavy on you.

, If you usually wear bras that feature padding and underwire, it might be a good idea to swap out for something cooler at camp. Boxers can cause chaffing on hot days where you sweat and walk a lot, so consider a switch to briefs or boxer briefs.


Sports bras or unlined bralettes are a good option as they have less material but still offer the proper support.
You should also wear socks to keep your feet cool. Take plenty of extras, as you’ll most likely need more than you think.

, You probably have limited clothing at camp, and you may not want to dirty everything on the first day, but as you wear clothes they trap dirt and sweat. Wearing dirty clothes can actually make you hotter because of all the dirt.On a related note, it’s good to make sure you shower consistently while at camp. As you get sweaty and shed skin cells, it’s good to wash all that off and keep clean.

"
"
Dress in layers.,
Wear your swimsuit.,
Keep it casual for dances.,
Suit up for the pool.,
Keep shirts untucked.,
Protect yourself when going on hikes.,
Stay dry with rain gear.",How to Dress at Summer Camp2," This means a couple things. For one, if you wear an undershirt, it can actually keep you cool as your top shirt will be less sweaty and can breathe more. It also means keep sweatshirts and long pants handy as summer tends to start out cool in the morning, get hot during midday, and often cool off again at night.


If you are going to be away from your bag throughout the hot afternoon and cool evening, you probably don’t want to wear your warm clothes all day, but you’ll definitely want to keep them with you.
As long as you follow the dress code at camp, it’s always good to have a sleeveless shirt or tank top on under your t-shirt so you can take the top layer off as the day warms up.

, For guys, swim trunks are basically the same as shorts anyway. For girls, a bathing suit may not be quite as comfortable as a bra and panties, but will serve a similar function.


Summer camp may include a lot of spontaneous swimming, so wearing your swimsuit as clothing, or under your clothing, makes it easier to take a quick dip.
Once your suit is wet, it probably won’t be the best for walking around in, so you may want to go switch out for dry clothes after you swim.

, You would typically dress up for a dance, maybe even a fancy gown or tux, but a summer camp dance can be a little less formal, while still looking nice. Girls could wear a light sundress while boys could opt for khaki shorts and a short sleeve polo.


You can still look nice enough to impress your peers without going overboard.
Since you probably won’t have access to an iron, you want to pack clothes that will hopefully not get too wrinkled in your bag.

, Many summer camps will require one piece swimsuits, tankinis, or shorts and a shirt for girls. Boys may have less restrictions, but will most likely be required to wear swim trunks, as opposed to just underwear or street clothes.


Even with a swimsuit, you may want to wear shorts and a shirt that you can take off before you swim. Wear something old that you don’t mind possibly getting chlorine on.

, Although tucking your shirt in is supposed to be a nicer look, in the heat of summer it just means more clothing around your already covered waist. Tucking your shirt in can cause more sweating and discomfort.To avoid the need for tucked in shirts, aim for shirts that are the appropriate length, which is just a few inches past the waistline of your pants.

, If you camp in a place with wilderness nearby, hiking is inevitable. Its often good to wear pants for hiking to keep out of poison ivy and avoid scratches from brush. Sturdy shoes are a must so you have good support.


Sunscreen, bug repellant, and water are also super important. If you’ll be gone for a long time, being without those could lead to serious discomfort or even illness.

, At camp you will probably be walking from your bed to the mess hall and all over camp in the course of the day. You don’t want to do that soaking wet, so plan for the chance of rain with a waterproof jacket or a poncho of some kind.


You probably won’t need to carry this around all day, every day, but pay attention to the weather and grab your gear if it seems like a chance of rain.
It’s better to carry something around for a while that you don’t need than it is to be soaking wet and uncomfortable.
Wet clothes, shorts and pants especially, can irritate your skin from all the rubbing if you walk around in them for too long.

"
"
Pack shoes that are worn in.,
Pack multiple sleeping options.,
Give your head and shoulders shade.,
Leave the jewelry at home.",How to Dress at Summer Camp3," You may be tempted to take some fresh sneakers or hiking boots to camp, but brand new shoes can cause blisters on your feet. Since you’ll be walking a lot, you want to wear shoes that have been broken in.On the other hand, don’t wear shoes that are so old they are barely staying together. You want to have good arch and ankle support, so shoes that are falling apart aren’t good for camp either.
Flip flops or sandals are good to have on hand for time at the beach or pool, but they probably aren’t the best for all day walking around.

, If you are going to be sleeping in a tent or unheated cabin, it may get cold at night. It might also be hot in a non-air conditioned cabin if it stays hot outside. Have lightweight and cool pajamas as well as thicker pajamas so you’re prepared either way., Wide brimmed hats are great for keeping your head cool and your shoulders from baking in the sun. You can also carry a scarf or bandana around, which is great to tie up long hair or use as a headband to keep sweat out of your eyes.


It’s also good to keep hair ties handy as long hair will most likely make your neck and shoulders much hotter during the summer. Consider wearing hair in a ponytail or bun more of the time.

, You may want to make a fashion statement with a necklace or fancy bracelet, but it’s better to pass on those at camp for a couple of reasons. Metal hanging against your skin will make you hotter, and jewelry is just another thing that you might lose in the shuffle of living out of a bag for a week or more.

Explore options at local educational facilities.,
Consider an immersion camp abroad.,
Send your child to stay with family abroad.,
Look into private or group instruction.",How to Enroll Your Child in a Summer Language Immersion Camp1," Reputable language immersion organizations will have websites containing information on the learning opportunities they offer. These websites will also include the cost of attendance and specific enrollment procedures for each camp. Get a good idea of the options that are available for your child, as well as the various types of summer language immersion opportunities, by familiarizing yourself with what’s available.


Websites will also contain contact information, including phone numbers and email addresses, where you can reach camp staff.;
, Language immersion camps can be day-only or overnight. For instance, one camp may run for certain hours for a series of days, while others will house and care for students for the entirety of the camp. In general, overnight camps are more immersive, but they also tend to cost more.Day-only language immersion camps are often held by community colleges or other small education organizations, while overnight language immersion camps are often held at larger universities, or even in a country where the language being taught is regularly spoken.

, Often, colleges and universities will host language learning programs of various types. While the universities near you may not offer exactly the type of summer language immersion camp you’re envisioning, they may offer a convenient way to expose your child to another language and culture.Language learning opportunities at universities are also much more likely to be affordably priced than private language camps, and can offer a comparable quality of instruction.
Most of the camps at larger educational facilities will be geared towards older children. However, many will offer camps for young children too, especially in the summer.
Local middle and high schools may also offer summer language day camps for kids of all ages, or be able to point you towards other opportunities in your area.

, Language immersion camps abroad will often be the most literally immersive options. They will offer the most interaction with native speakers of the language your child is learning, and will provide first-person cultural context as well. Further, the opportunity to learn alongside other students from around the world is also advantageous., If you have close friends or family members in another country where another language is spoken, sending an older child to stay with them for a while can provide a truly immersive language experience. This can also be a much cheaper alternative to a formal language immersion camp.

, If you are unable to find an immersive summer camp you want to send your child to, you can bring an instructor to your children. While this is a less immersive option, a language instructor may be a good option for children who are not ready to attend a camp away from home. Keep in mind that costs are often high for this sort of instruction, but will vary widely.You may be able to find other families in your neighborhood, for instance, and collectively hire an instructor to work with your children and some of your neighbor's kids all together.

Look into the camp’s teachers.,
Consider out-of-classroom experiences.,
Note each camp’s age range.",How to Enroll Your Child in a Summer Language Immersion Camp2," One of the most telling factors about the quality of instruction your child would receive is the level of experience of the camp’s instructors. If information about instructors’ experience isn’t clearly advertised on a camp’s website, ask them about the qualifications of their instructors over the phone or through an email.As least some, if not all, of the instructors at an immersive language camp should be native speakers of the language your child will be studying.

, One of the main benefits of “immersive” language camps are the opportunities that many camps offer outside of the traditional teaching environment. Some camps do a great job of getting kids out of the classroom and into environments where the language they are learning is regularly used.Examples of specific activities will vary for students of different ages, but can include taking field trips, going on tours, eating out, and attending popular entertainment off of the camp’s grounds.

, Language immersion camps of various types exist for children from the ages of 18 months to 18 years. Some camps welcome children of widely varied ages, while other specialize in working with children of a certain age. It’s often to best to opt for camps that specialize in teaching children that are your child’s age.Given the choice between a camp that has kids from 1st to 8th grade, and a camp that specializes in teaching kids from 1st through 3rd grade, the latter will likely provide a more focused environment for your child.

Begin contacting summer camps by early spring.,
Ask about total cost of attendance.,
Mention any concerns you have.,
Complete enrollment by registration deadlines.",How to Enroll Your Child in a Summer Language Immersion Camp3," You can start planning your child’s summer at any point, but you will have plenty of time to do so if you begin in late winter or early spring. Most importantly, this will give you time to consider your options, reach out to the camps you're interested in, and get your child registered before the best camps fill up.

, Two warning signs about a camp you may want to avoid are those with costs that are not mentioned up front and/or poor customer service. Once you’ve narrowed down your options, find contact information for each camp you’re considering and ask questions like, “What is the total cost of enrolling my child in your camp?”You should get prompt, direct responses, with detailed information about the cost of attendance and other information.
For overnight camps, there may be fees other than tuition, including bedding fees, excursion charges, insurance costs, and dining costs. Information on these charges should be clearly featured on the websites of trustworthy camps, and mentioned when you ask about cost.
Note that total costs are often several hundreds of dollars or more per week of attendance.

, Sending your child to a summer camp can be worrisome, especially if you’re considering an overnight camp or a camp in another country. Feel free to ask camp administrators about any concerns you have, including those about the safety and security of the camp.Reputable camps will take every measure to ensure the safety of kids that study with them. They will also be happy to speak with you about the specific steps they have taken to do so.

, Once you’ve made the decision regarding which camp you wish to send your child to, enrolling your child will likely be an easy process. Most camps will offer a registration portal online, where you can schedule the dates your child will attend and pay the associated fees before the registration deadline.


Register early to ensure that your child has a spot at the camp and avoid any fees associated with late registration.

Know what the job entails.,
Prepare.,
Pay attention in training.,
Become friends with the other counselors.,
Memorize the camp schedule and carry it with you ALWAYS.,
Get to know your camper's names.,
Get to know your campers personalities.,
Team building in order to help your campers get along, do activities throughout the week that help the kids become a unit.,
Reflect with campers at the end of the day.,
Use your breaks wisely.,
Have a great time.",How to Be a Great Camp Counselor," Being a counselor is a very draining experience. If you can smile through the trying times and spend your days giving kids one of the greatest summer of their lives, then read on. If not, you really must evaluate why you want to be a counselor. It's a lot of fun, but a lot of work. It is not a week of being a camper, for older kids! You must be responsible, and able to handle any situation that comes up.;
, Prepare for each day and whatever it may throw at you. If you prepare yourself and know the schedule, you can prepare the campers. They will have less anxiety about the day and have something to look forward to. Preparing you and your campers make you invaluable in that you will be able to handle anything. Talk to previous counselors and ask the staff for any advice and resources.

, Most camps offer a training period, during which you will learn everything about how the camp is run, and emergency procedure. It's very easy to tune out, DON'T! You never know when you will need it again. When little Jimmy collapses on the playground, you don't want to be thinking to yourself ""I wish I had been paying attention to the lecture instead of watching that squirrel.""

, You don't all have to be best friends forever, but it is essential that you all get along, at the minimum. If counselors are arguing, even if its done far outside earshot of the campers, because they will pick up on it. Most likely, you will have to work even a little bit with all of the other counselors and everything goes smoother if you are friends. You don't want to find out later in the summer that you are leading an activity with the counselor you do not care for.

, You will want to know what is going on next, and what time the next break is. If you do not have your schedule when the campers ask what is happening next, they will think that you are incompetent and you will lose their respect.

, For example, if you run around calling Jane by Brittany's name and vice versa, you will lose their respect and they will feel hurt that they are not important enough to know your name. Likewise, it is difficult to correct a camper's behavior when you don't know their name. Play name games, if it helps you and repeat their names often.

, Certain campers you will love, certain campers you will not really care for (silently, of course). The key is to know what they will do. You have to know who has to be watched constantly, and who always does what they are told. You must anticipate how they will react to each other, and activities. Try to spend at least ten minutes of face time with each camper each day. They will like you more if they feel that they are the center of attention, and it will allow you to understand them better.

, Ask them questions, start conversations and play games that help the kids get to know each other, and NEVER play games or do activities that pit the kids against each other competitively until the second or third day. It might create bad blood.

, It's important to know what the campers think of each other and of their day. Just before they leave, make everyone sit in a circle and try one of the following:


For General Reflection: ""Rose, Bud and Thorn"" (What was the best and worse part of your day and what are you looking forward to most for tomorrow) ""Random Question"" (If you could have any superpower, what would it be? What's your favorite activity and why? If you had one last meal what would it be.)
For Team building: ""Positive Points"" (The campers sit in a circle and say one positive thing about each person beside them) ""3 things in common"" (Have the kids pair up and find out three things they have in common with their partner and share with the group when they have finished. This is also good for breaking up cliques)

, Remember that this is YOUR time, do whatever you feel will make you the happiest and get you re-energized for your next shift. Breaks are a great time to take naps, check your phone (if you are allowed), read a book or hang out with other counselors.

, It might seem like a lot of work, but you will change lives. It is amazing to see the quiet camper that sat in the corner at the beginning of the session getting along with her other campers, or to see what they have learned. You will get out of the day as much as you put into it. HAVE A GOOD TIME and the kids will! You are a positive role model, give yourself a pat on the back.

Find someone you can trust.,
Talk to someone.,
Be persistent.",How to Deal with Bullies at Summer Camp (Kids)1," Being at summer camp may be difficult because you may not know the counselors or people in charge. You may feel comfortable approaching a teacher at school, but the strangers at camp can be daunting. Try to find one person you trust and feel comfortable approaching. This person can be your go to person if things get too difficult for you.If the bullying occurs and you are not sure who to go to, imagine yourself telling each person. How do you think they would react? Choose the one you can visualize yourself telling most comfortably.
You may want to confide in your parents if something happens to you at camp.;
, It is important that you don’t keep silent about the bullying. You should share with someone what is going on. Even if the end game isn’t to get the bully to stop, you can find a friend or ally in a counselor or other authority figure at camp to talk to.This person can be someone you can go to if you need to get away from the situation or feel safe.
Tell the person, “I am being bullied. This is a very difficult situation for me. I need someone to talk to. I don’t know what to do, but I feel upset and nervous. I was hoping you could help me with this situation.”
You can also talk to your parents. They can help you figure out how to tell a counselor or other camp authority figure, or take action themselves if you are having trouble getting support.

, If the first person you tell about the bullying doesn’t help, tell another counselor, team leader, or authority figure. Keep telling people until someone does something. You should not have to deal with bullying at camp, and the authority figures are there to help keep you safe.Tell the counselor, “I am being bullied. I have told other counselors, but nothing has been done yet. I feel scared, and it is negatively affecting my camp experience.”

Walk away.,
Control your temper when you are bullied.,
Respond to the bully.,
Ignore the bully.,
Try not to be alone with the bully.",How to Deal with Bullies at Summer Camp (Kids)2," One of the best things you can do when you are being bullied is to walk away. People who bully get satisfaction from the reaction. If you walk away, you control the situation by being able to remove yourself from it. You also are able to eliminate any reaction to the bullying.You may not be able to walk completely away. You may be in the middle of an activity or in a room. Try to put physical space between you and the person who is bullying you, even if it is just moving to the other side of the counselor.

, Though the temptation is strong, you shouldn’t answer bullying with violent, angry behavior. Camps have rules and consequences for those who get into physical altercations, like fights. To help control the situation and not get in trouble, you should not get angry or physical if someone bullies you.If someone pushes you or yells at you, try to walk away. If you can’t, take a few deep breaths to calm down.
If someone is hurting you physically, call out for help. An adult should be nearby who can help you.

, If it gets to the point where nothing else is working, you can respond to the bully. Do this by standing up to them in a non-violent way and telling them to leave you alone. Speak in a firm voice and avoid putting down the bully or calling the bully names.Hold your head up high and in a confident voice, say, “Leave me alone” or “I’m not going play with you.” Try to act brave even if you don’t feel brave.
Practice saying these things beforehand. If you practice, even if it is just in the mirror or your pillow. Saying the words through a few times can make it easier when you are faced with the bully.

, Though it may be difficult to ignore the bully, not responding can help discourage the bully. Since bullies generally want you to respond, cry, or get upset, by ignoring them, you are not giving them the satisfaction they are seeking. Though you may be really upset, try to ignore them.Try to pretend like the bully isn’t there. Tune them out.
You may want to turn and start talking to someone or put in earphones.
Ignoring them doesn’t mean that you aren’t affected or upset. You can cry when you are alone or talk to a trusted friend afterwards. The idea is that you don’t let the bully see you react.

, People often don’t bully when others are around, especially authority figures. Though you won’t be around counselors the entire time you’re at camp, you can try to limit the amount of time you are alone with the bullies.This may mean always having a friend with you when you walk around. When you have down time, you may stay within view of counselors in case the bully starts bothering you.

Focus on activities you really enjoy.,
Adopt the right attitude.,
Try to make friends.,
Step in if someone is being bullied.,
Learn what your camp’s bullying policy is.",How to Deal with Bullies at Summer Camp (Kids)3," To help redirect your thoughts from the bullying, you should focus on activities at summer camp that you really enjoy. Summer camp can be a great place to learn new skills and try new things. Instead of dwelling on the bully, put your efforts into activities that make you feel good.Try new things. If you’ve never been canoeing, tried archery, or done a lot of hiking, make attempts to try these new activities.
Doing activities you enjoy and trying new things can help boost your self-esteem and make you feel better, despite the bullying.

, You may not be good at everything that you do at camp. You may even be worried about being bullied because of an activity. However, you should have a good attitude about trying new things. Remember, most campers are in your shoes and are doing new things. Just enjoy the experience and try your best.


For example, if you are don't think you are good at sports, you may be afraid a bully will bother you because of that. Instead of focusing on that, think about having fun with the other campers and trying something new. Adopt the attitude of trying your best and enjoy yourself.

, The person or persons who are bullying you are not the only people at summer camp. There are many kids at the camp, and some of them might even be in a situation like you. Talk to other campers and make friends. Having friends at camp can help you not feel so alone., You can make a difference in someone else's camp experience by helping them out if they are being bullied. Instead of not doing anything, if you see someone who is being bullied, go over and talk to them. Ignore the bully and help the person being bullied redirect their attention to a friendly face.


You can walk up to the person being bullied and say, ""Hello. I was wondering if you wanted to go grab a snack/play a game/hang out?"" or call them by name and say, ""I am glad I found you. Did you see that movie/hear that song?""
If you feel comfortable enough, you may say, ""Stop being mean to them"" or ""Leave them alone.""
You both can support each other since you are experiencing the same thing.

, Most camps have strict no-bullying policies. You can figure out what the bullying process is so you know what the camp will do if you report someone is bullying you.Many camps will talk about the bullying policy on the first day so the campers know what to expect. If you are unsure, you can also ask a counselor or other authority figure.

Personality: Go up to people and introduce yourself.,
Social Life: People will only want to hang out with you if you're both interested and interesting.,
Be Creative: If there is nothing to do, then think of something!,
Trend-Setting & Following: Don't be exactly one and the same as everyone else just for the sake of being popular.,
Riding the Bus: One of the easiest times to make new friends is on the bus.,
Hygiene: People will avoid you if your breath stinks.",How to Become Popular in Summer Camp," Don't laugh too hard or talk too loud just to appear confident; you'll seem insecure and fake. Start conversations: ask people to go get ice cream with you or to go to the pool. Make your social group as large as possible. It depends what type of friends you want, but aim to be interesting. At camp there are normally at least a hundred kids, and there will be all different types of people to get acquainted with - endless possibilities.;
, Ask questions and be prepared to answer them too. Keep in mind that music is a great way to bring people together, so if you're not sure what to talk about, ask someone about their favourite singer or band. Be upbeat, and if you are naturally shy, take your time; don't automatically push people away.

, Make people think of you as the one to come for to have fun. All around camp there are things to do, and you will be highly respected if you can take the tiniest things and turn them into a blast for all.

, If you plan to overthrow a popular girl, don't act exactly like her; people will think of you as fake and desperate. Instead, try to quietly get above her by simply being yourself and being better. You don't have to be her exact opposite either, if that's not the type of person you are. Just be yourself, and people will see that you might have some great qualities she doesn't and want to hang out with you instead. If that girl has a close-knit group of ""exclusive"" friends, try to include different types of people in your group. Don't be a sheep for the sake of popularity, as it won't work, and you will be stuck being someone you hate. Remember that the social groups of camp are a bit different than in school, so even though there is a popular group, chances are it won't be quite what you're used to.

, If you are taking a bus, talk to a few girls before the bus leaves then once you board the bus ask one to sit next to you. If she's excited you asked and asks you to sit with her on the ride home, you know that she likes you. Bring along some card games, magazines with quizzes, or other multi-player activities to do on the bus. Chances are that unless other people came with a friend, they are probably as bored as you are. You might be able to make friends before you even leave the bus!

, Make sure you bring all the necessary products: a comb, shampoo, conditioner, detangler, mouthwash, toothpaste, deodorant, etc. You will probably get dirtier at camp than you do at home. Take as many showers as allowed without being excessive. Staying clean and cute is awesome, but try not to get OCD about hygiene. Gum or chewing gum could help your breath for a short while, but some camps don't allow gum or mints. Before a social event, make sure you take a quick few minutes in the dorm to brush your hair and teeth and apply deodorant.

Keep some of the following points in mind when dealing with a difficult camper:If a camper is distracted or doing something other than what they should be you can try joining them for a moment before redirecting them to the task at hand.
For example, if they are watching a video on their phone instead of cleaning, watch the video with them for a moment before asking them to clean.
Simple and clear instructions for activities are appreciated by campers.
Avoid giving negative commands such as “Don't do this”. It will be ineffective and cause the camper to view you negatively.

, It's all too easy to simply issue commands to your campers. However, they are unlikely to respect you if you don't demonstrate the same qualities and actions that you demand of them.

Pack up some reminders of home.",How to Choose Therapy Camps for Kids with Special Needs," Before you begin looking into specific camps, take some time to consider what precisely you hope the child gets out of the experience. Is the goal to build social skills? Learn a sport, activity, or skill? Help with academic performance? Enhance therapy efforts? Or just get away for a bit and have fun?Make an honest assessment of the child’s physical, mental, and emotional abilities and limitations and consider how a camp setting can accommodate — and, ideally, build upon — them.Involve the child in the process. Ask the child what they would like to do in camp, or what about going to camp excites or worries them.
The more specific you can be in your goals, the more specific you can be when looking into therapy camps.;
, While a summertime, “sleepaway” camp on a rural lake may be what comes to mind for you, there are a wide array of camping options available for kids with or without special needs. Some camps, for instance, have a special focus or theme, such as equine therapy camps that are geared toward autistic kids.Depending on the child’s needs and interests, you may want to first look into half- or full-day programs held at a local park, community center, etc. Or, consider day camps (so the child can sleep at home each night), after-school camps, activity programs or workshops (at a museum, nature conservancy, etc.), and the traditional overnight camps., Many kids with special needs will derive the most benefit from therapy camps that are geared toward working with kids in similar circumstances. However, you might also believe the child would be best served by attending a “mainstream” camp — for instance, to attend with a sibling without special needs. If so, know that a camp cannot legally deny a child entry based on disability status, and must provide reasonable accommodations.Your insurance company, school district, or relevant government agency that deals with special needs children may be willing or obligated to provide some amount of financial support to enable a special needs child to attend camp and receive appropriate accommodations. Do some research and be persistent in seeking sources of financial support.

, You should read lots of brochures, examine websites, and visit prospective camps if possible to help weigh your options. Often, though, the most persuasive information comes from other parents, caregivers, or therapists for special needs children.


Consult with the child’s physician, therapists, and teachers regarding the best type of camp setting for him or her, along with any specific camp recommendations. Talk to the parents of classmates and friends — and perhaps the other children themselves — about their experiences and opinions regarding certain camps.

Watch for red flags. Some camps, especially ABA-based camps, may force unwilling children into compliance, or use abusive strategies.Ensure that this camp provides a respectful environment, with full access to everything the child needs (that isn't dependent on compliance).
Of course, in the end, you have to make the decision about what camp is right for your child. Welcome (and solicit) others’ advice, but trust your own judgment.

, Many therapy camps have a particular program focus that targets particular therapeutic and skill-building benefits for special needs children. For instance, many camps use nature exploration or interacting with animals as a means to foster physical, emotional, and social development.Nature therapy camps usually involve guided nature walks and discussions, and have been shown to reduce stress and increase relaxation and immune function in some children.
Horticultural programs teach basic gardening skills and can help improve coordination, balance, endurance, memory and task skills, and socialization.
Equine therapy camps offer physical benefits through horseback riding as well as developing emotional skills via the connection between the child and a particular horse.There are also programs that utilize therapy dogs or other pets.

, As with any other child (or adult), expressing oneself artistically can help special needs kids to recognize, explore, and share their feelings, and make connections with others through shared activities.Art therapy programs use painting, sculpting, and other methods of artistic creation to foster creativity, behavior and motor skill management, and emotional well-being.
Drama camps help kids express feelings, solve problems, and explore their inner selves through acting.
Music therapy camps can help develop communication, eye contact, pattern recognition, creativity, and fine motor skills, among other benefits.

, Adventure camp programs are among the most popular types of special needs therapy camps. Engaging in activities like rock climbing, rope course navigation, mountain biking, canoeing, and so on with other kids can provide a range of physical, communication, and emotional benefits.You can also find sport-specific programs and camps, such as adaptive basketball, baseball, swimming and biking. Being able to take part in sports with other kids like them can fuel feelings of inclusion and pride in special needs children — and they tend to be a lot of fun.

, Some camps focus specifically on helping develop practical life skills so that special needs children are better prepared to live independently or semi-independently. These can provide a nice complement to life skills programs offered at school or elsewhere.Such programs often focus on practical skills like using the phone, communicating with strangers, making purchases, getting a job, and using a bank, as well as basic safety skills.

, A good therapy camp for special needs kids should have an overarching program philosophy that includes clearly stated goals. This philosophy should be readily apparent in all brochures, web pages, etc., as well as when conversing with staff members. These sources also shouldn’t be shy when it comes to describing the program’s history and track record of success.For instance, if you are considering an equine therapy camp, the website or other materials should clearly state what benefits they believe Asperger’s / autistic kids receive from interacting with horses, and how exactly these benefits are developed through specific activities and programs., If it is at all possible for you to personally meet the people who will be interacting with your special needs child on a daily basis at camp, by all means take advantage of the opportunity. Think of it not simply as an interview process, but also as a means of developing a rapport and common understanding regarding the child’s particular circumstances and needs.


At some camps, you may find that much of the staff is comprised of eager teens and young adults, while at others you may find primarily adults with more specialized training. There are pros and cons to consider when weighing enthusiasm against experience, so make time to talk to several staff members who would be interacting with your child.
Ask about the camper-to-staff member ratio at each camp you are considering. There is no “magic number,” but in virtually every case, lower is better. Some experts consider a 1:1 camper-to-staff member ratio to be ideal when dealing with severely disabled children, for example., Here, you need to think carefully about the child you intend to send to camp. Do they thrive in a regimented daily schedule, where everything is predictable, recurring, and comforting? Or, does the child do better in a setting where quick adjustments and adaptations are made? Essentially, ask yourself whether a highly structured therapy camp would provide comfort to or additional anxiety for the child.The camp should be able to provide you with sample daily schedules, and give you information regarding how rigidly they are adhered to.
Ask how they would respond to certain possible situations — for instance, the child not wanting to go to lunch, really enjoying crafting class and wanting to stay longer, or panicking about the notion of going swimming. Ask questions relevant to how the child in question tends to act and respond.

, Never just assume that a camp has a functional food service program, or adequate medical resources, especially when you are dealing with a special needs child. No question is too basic or too mundane to ask. If on a tour, ask to see the eating, sleeping, bathing, etc. arrangements in person.Take special care in examining and asking about the medical facilities and policies regarding injuries and illness. Make sure the camp can deal effectively with your child’s daily and potential medical needs.
Have the camp’s communication policy clearly spelled out for you. How often can you contact the child or the child contact you under normal circumstances? How minor or serious does a situation at camp involving your child need to be before you are contacted?

, Some kids, special needs or not, will immediately embrace being at a “sleepaway” camp and enjoy every minute of the experience. Others will have a great deal of difficulty adjusting, and may simply not be cut out for it. Encourage your child to try a new experience, but don’t force him or her into a situation just because a certain camp is highly recommended or tailored to his or her particular disabilities.If it works best for your child to start with a local after-school or day camp program, and possibly move up from there, do it. If your child will be comforted by attending the same camp as a sibling or good friends, strongly consider the possibility.
There is no “one size fits all” approach to therapy camps. Do what is best for your unique child.

, Once you have chosen a camp, make sure its staff members have all the information they may need to effectively work with your child. Make sure in particular that the camp director and counselors who will be dealing directly with your child are well informed.Consult with your child’s doctor regarding specific medical information that should be shared with relevant members of the camp staff. Draw up a document listing your child’s medical conditions and medication and therapy requirements.
Also share strategies that tend to work for you when dealing with your child. How do you get them to eat? Get ready for bed? Calm down? Open up and express feelings?

, Therapy camps are supposed to be new and different experiences in comparison to normal daily life. That does not mean they need to be a complete break from familiar comforts and patterns, though. If you can help ward off the homesickness that is most likely to occur early on during camp, you may make the entire experience more enjoyable and meaningful.Pack up a few photos, books, comfort items, or a handwritten note as reminders of home and reminders that you are close at hand and always thinking about the child.
Be judicious in deciding how many reminders to send along, though. Base your selections on your child’s unique personality and needs. Leave room for the camp to be new and different as intended. Be clear that you are just a phone call away, but don’t promise or try to call all the time.

Organize your campsite appropriately.",How to Set Up a Tent," When setting up your tent, it's important to put a barrier in between the ground and the bottom of your tent to protect it from gathering moisture. A good-quality plastic or vinyl tarp should accompany any tent.


Fold the tarp into the relative shape of the tent, but slightly smaller. You don't want any part of the tarp to hang out beyond the edge of the tent, otherwise it'll collect water underneath in case it rains. Fold up longer edges and tuck them under the tent.;
, Most modern tents are made of lightweight nylon, all-in-one tent poles, and stakes, while older army-style tents often feature more complicated poles and cloth coverings. At the very least, you'll need the tent itself and the poles, and the method of putting them is generally the same.








, Find the bottom side of the tent and put that side down on the tarp. Orient the windows and door of the tent in the direction you'd like them to face. Lay it out flat and turn your attention to the poles.








, Depending on your particular tent, they may be connected with bungee ropes, or they may be numbered and require that you connect them yourself. Put the tent poles together and lay them across the flat tent.








, Most basic tents will have two tent poles that cross each other to form an X that will form the basic frame of the tent. To fit them into the tent, usually you'll put the end of the pole into an eyelet at each corner, and slide the pole either through small flaps on the top of the tent, or attach plastic clips on the top of the tent to the pole.









Read the directions for your particular tent, or look closely to determine how the poles fit in. All tents are differently designed.

, This will take some coordination, so it's usually helpful to have a partner for this part. After you've fit both poles through their connection spots, they should probably bend of their own according, straightening up and raising the tent into what looks basically like something you could sleep in.









Some tents will need a bit of coaxing. Pull the corners apart so they're square and make sure the poles are secure and untangled.
Depending on the tent that you use, there may be plastic hooks attached to little chords that are part of the construction. Hook those onto the tent pole frame in the appropriate place, after you've raised the tent up some. Attach any other necessary structural components to the tent so that it stands up.

, When you've got the tent square on the tarp, use the metal tent stakes to fit through the flaps near the ground at the corners and push them into the ground. If you're in rocky or particularly hard ground, you might need to use a tiny hammer or other blunt object to hammer them in a little. Some tent stakes are pretty easy to bend, so be careful as you do this.








, Some tents come with an extra rain guard, called a rain fly. It's basically another sheet of material that covers the tent. Some have corresponding tent poles and are more elaborate than others, so read the instructions that come with your tent to learn how to put it together if you have a complicated one.








, If it rains while you're camping, it's important to let the tent thoroughly dry inside and out before packing it away, or you'll have a mildewy surprise next time you want to go camping. Hang it up on some low-hanging branches, or on the clothes line when you get home to let it dry out thoroughly, and then pack it away securely for next time.

, If you've got a stuff-sack in which to pack your tent, it can seem difficult at first to get the whole thing back in there. There's no secret way to fold a tent, and it's usually better to roll them up as opposed to folding them, anyway. Lay each item--the tent itself, and the rain fly--and fold them lengthwise, then roll them up as tightly as possible and insert each into the sack.








, It's important to not form creases in your tent, which can start weak spots in the fabric that will widen into holes. Roll, stuff, and cram your tent, but avoid folding it and pressing sharp creases into it.


It's better to have a stuffed and wrinkly tent next time you go to pitch it, then to have really sharp creases that'll form holes. Remember, a tent isn't a fashion statement, it's a shelter from the elements.

, When you've got the fly and the tent in the bag, stuff the poles and the stakes carefully in on the side. It'll likely be pretty tight in there, so be gently and don't catch the poles on the edge of the tent and rip it.








, Sometimes, it can be a while between camping trips. It's a good idea to open up your tent semi-regularly and air it out in the yard to make sure there isn't any moisture ruining the fabric or mice taking up residence in your abode. You don't have to pitch it, just take it out, shake it out, and put it back in a different way.

, Choose a wide-enough open space in which you can assemble your tent. If you're in a state or national park, make sure that you're camping in a designated camping area. Make sure that you're not on private property and follow all the laws in the area that govern camping., Remove rocks, twigs, and other debris from the spot that you're going to pitch on. If you're in an area with pine trees, spreading a thin layer of pine needles can make the ground a little softer and better for sleeping.









Avoid setting up your tent in swales, divots, or hollows in the ground. Anywhere that's lower than the surrounding area will pool with water in the event that it rains. Even if you've got a waterproof tent, it'll be a tough situation when it starts floating away. The ideal ground is flat and raised up compared to the surrounding area.

, Position the side of the tent with doors away from the prevailing wind, making the tent less likely to balloon and create extra tension on the stakes.


Try to use the natural tree line to create a windbreak if it's especially windy. Move closer to the trees so they'll block off the breeze a little bit.
Avoid camping in dry river/creek beds in case flash flooding occurs and avoid camping under trees, which can be dangerous in storms and can drop branches without warning on your tent.

, It can be a good idea to anticipate the sun's path for the morning time, so you won't be rudely awakened. In the summertime, tents can act like ovens, meaning that you'll wake up sweaty and irritable if you set up your tent in the direct path of the sun. In the ideal tent placement, you'll remain in the shade through the morning so you can wake up comfortably at a time of your choosing.

, Keep the sleeping area well away from cooking and toilet areas, preferably upwind of them. If you have a fire at your campsite, make sure it's not close enough to spray sparks onto the tent, and make sure you put your fire out completely before you turn in for the night.

There are several factors to consider, but the first is to make sure that the area you've selected to camp upon is legal and available for camping.


If you're in a state or national park, make sure that you've set up in a designated campsite. Often, these will be marked with numbered metal posts and will feature picnic tables, fire pits, and sometimes water spigots for using.
If you're backcountry camping, make sure that you follow the regulations for the park or nature reserve in which you're camping. Different parks will have regulations about how close you're allowed to camp to water, for example, or how close you can camp next to the trail.
Wherever you're camping, it's always critical to avoid private property to avoid a rude awakening in the middle of your camping trip from an angry landowner. Never camp anywhere camping is not permitted.;
, When you've selected a suitable campsite, it's time to pick where you want to place your tent. There are several factors to consider, and the first should be your comfort. It's hard to sleep on an angle, so it's recommended the thou find a very flat and preferably brushy site to set your tent up on.


Find higher ground on the site, if possible. If it rains, you don't want to be at a lower point, to which water will run. For this reason, it's a good idea to avoid dry creek beds, little divots, and hollows in the ground. You don't want to wake up in a puddle.

, Ideally, a tent should be placed so that it will remain in shade throughout the following morning, especially if it’s hot out. And even though a dome tent is wind resistant, it’s also a good idea to find as much of a wind break as possible, in case the weather should pick up while you're out hiking or away from the tent. The last thing you'd want is to come back to an empty camp site! Placing a tent to the west of a hillside or a treeline would be the best way of giving yourself the most comfortable night inside and a cool morning to follow.


Never camp under trees. If it's raining, or threatening rain, it can be tempting to think that setting up under some tree cover would be a safe alternative. Unfortunately, this risks lightning and other hazards. A tent won't stop a falling branch, should something happen. Set up well-clear of such hazards.

, Ideally, you’ll want to place your tent upwind from designated fire areas or pits at the campsite. Make sure that any embers or sparks will be clear of your tent to avoid dangerous fire hazards.


It’s also smart to place your tent upwind from your toilet area, if you’re going to be camping long term.

, When you've selected your ideal location, spend a few minutes clearing any significant rocks, branches, or other debris from the campsite. After you set up your tent, it'll be too late to dig out that rock that's digging straight into your kidney in the middle of the night. Do some work ahead of time and you'll set yourself up for a much more comfortable sleep.


If you can, look for areas dense with pine needles, if you're in an environment with fir trees. Pine needles can provide an excellent and soft natural mattress, which can help to keep your comfortable.

, While most tents don't come with them, it's common to line the campsite with a plastic or vinyl tarp to provide a moisture barrier between the tent and the ground. While not necessary, strictly-speaking, it's recommended to use a camping tarp to keep moisture from leeching into the tent from below. If it rains, you'll be happy you've got this.Fold the tarp according to the shape of the tent, but slightly smaller. If there's any risk of rain, you don't want any of the corners sticking out. Don't worry about making it perfect, because you'll be able to tuck them under after you put up the tent.

, Remove all the components of the tent and inspect them to make sure everything is included and in good working conditions. You won't be able to set up a tent with some broken or missing tent poles, so it's good to take a minute to make sure everything is there. Each tent will be slightly different, depending on the size, style, and brand of the dome tent, but the basic components of newer dome tents should be mostly universal. You'll find:


The tent itself, which should be made of vinyl, plastic, and other materials, with a zippered opening and opening flaps where the tent poles will be inserted.
The rain fly, which might look similar to the size and shape of the tent, but without the zippered openings and flaps for the tent poles. This is used to secure over the tent and offer a barrier from the rain, if necessary.
Tent poles, which are generally connected with bungee chords or other stretchy material to keep them matched, but might not be with older tent poles, which might need to be screwed together. At the very least, there will be at least two and as many as five or six different poles, which will be made of several foot-long segments. You shouldn't need any tools to fix the tent poles together.Stakes should be included to fix the tent to the ground, through small flaps at the base of the tent, and possibly on the rain fly. There should be between four and ten tent stakes. You might also want to include some kind of small hammer to fix them into the ground.
Bungee ropes may also be included to fix the rain fly to the poles, or to fix the tent to the stakes. Each tent will be somewhat different.

, Put together, the tent poles should be six or ten feet long, snapped, fixed, or screwed together. All tent poles will be put together slightly differently, but most modern tent poles are connected with bungee ties that allow you to just snap them together without much effort. Fix them, so they're all put together, and then lay them on the ground flat.

, Flatten out the tent over the tarp and cross the tent poles over it, where they'll eventually go to make sure you've matched the right pole with the right location. The most basic tents will have to long crossing poles that will form an ""X"" pattern across the tent, passing through the flaps. When you're sure they're oriented correctly, push the pole through the flaps and leave them flat on the ground. Insert both poles.


Different tents might have a few different sizes of poles, so you'll have to use your judgment to figure out which goes where, or consult the instructions. This can be the most difficult part of putting a tent together, if you don't have the instructions, but try to hold up the tent to see the basic shape of it, so see where they should go.

, Insert the tips of each pole into the eyelets at the end of each corner of the tent, to raise the tent and make it start taking shape. The poles should bend with some force, helping it to stand. It's usually much easier to do with a helper, standing opposite each other and bending each pole in tandem and helping hold it up.


When you've got the poles staked, you might want to fluff it gently and pull the poles out slightly to let everything settle. Again, all dome tents will be slightly different.

, There should be little vinyl hoops or eyelets at each corner and in the center of each side of the tent, which you should use to stake the tent to the ground. Push the stake through and into the ground to secure the tent.


If you're going to be sleeping in the tent immediately, you may choose to not stake it, especially if you're in an area with lots of coverage and low wind. If you're going hiking though, or the wind it up, it's usually important to stake the tent to the ground so it doesn't blow away.

, Fit the rain fly over the top of the tent and attach it to the tent. For some tents, the rain fly will be velcroed to the tent poles in different places, but on others it will be attached with bungee cords down to the stakes, stretching gently.


Some people choose to not put the rain fly on the tent, if they're sure it won't rain while you're camping. Some rain fly tarps will obscure your ability to see out the windows of the tent, which means you might leave it off it you want. It's usually better to be on the safe side, though, and put it on.
After you've got the tent up, fold the corners of the tarp up and under the tent to make sure it's out of the way. Leaving any of it hanging out will promote water pooling underneath, if rains, so you want to make sure none of the tarp is showing.

, After camping, let the tent dry thoroughly in the sun before you pack it up and away, if you can, so avoid mildew building up inside the tent. Remove the rain fly, the stakes, and everything from the inside of the tent and fluff it out gently to let it air out.

, Never fold a tent, as you would a shirt or a flag. To avoid folding creases into the tent, you want to stuff or roll them into the stuff sack included with the tent. This will help keep the tent solid and waterproof, making it an essential maintenance step in the life of the tent. Stuff in the tent and the rainfly into the stuff sack before you put anything else in.

, After you stuff in the tent and the rain fly, slide the poles and the stakes in to the side of the other materials, being careful not to catch the metal on the side of the tent and tear it. Sometimes the stakes and the poles will have separate bags to help you keep them together.

, Periodically, pull your tent out of the bag and let the air get to it, especially if it gets wet at some point during use. If you don't camp much, it's important to let the tent air out so you won't be confronted with a mouldering tent a year from now. Let it air out in the sun if necessary.

Give it a final check.",How to Pitch a Pop up Tent," Pop-up tents are different from conventional tents. They have a flexible frame which springs into shape as soon as the tent is released from its restraining strap. These tents are very lightweight and fold away almost flat.;
, Find a flat area, ideally on ground higher than that around it. This means your tent won't flood when it rains and you won't be sleeping on a slope. In most campsites you will have a set area as your pitch. But if you are camping in a crowded field, don't plonk your tent too near to somebody else's. Sound travels easily between tents, and you may need some space for guy lines and cooking. Give yourself a 6 metre (20 feet) berth from any neighbouring tents.

, Clear away any stones, sticks or other sharp objects that may damage the floor of your tent and make the ground uncomfortable to sleep on.

, Remove the tent and pegs from the tent bag.

, Pull off the restraining band. The tent will 'pop' open. Turn the tent the right way up with the door in a position you are happy with. If you are forced to pitch on an incline or uneven surface, ensure the door faces downhill to prevent the tent flooding.

, Secure the tent to the ground by putting pegs through the loops at either end of the tent. Push or hammer the pegs into the ground at a 45 degree angle towards the tent. This stops the wind uprooting them. Your tent may have extra peg positions along each side. If so, peg out each one.

, The tent will have guy ropes already attached. Secure the guy ropes into the ground at either end. Guy ropes are adjustable in case you are restrained by space. Adjust the slide to make the ropes as taut as possible.

, Stand back and admire your work. Make sure that each guy rope is secured and that the pegs are sunk into the ground. If anything looks wrong, correct it.

, To set up the two gadget poles, you could either mallet them down and/or secure them to pegs pulling in opposite directions. You could set the string across higher up or lower down depending on how waterproof you want you tent to be and how easy easy it will be to move in and out of it.


It is better to set up the basha between two trees, as they tend to be more secure than gadget poles.







, Tie the four corners to the string and peg in the four corners. Pull the guy-lines tight. Pull the opposite corners first. Having the guy lines go away from the basha at around 45 degrees is best.

If your child enjoys computers, consider sending them to a coding summer camp. If they are interested in music, band camp may be a good option. Ask them where they would like to go, and then you'll have a basis of what to start researching.Summer camp is also a great opportunity for your child to try new things. Ask them if there's anything they would like to try, whether it be archery, learning how to swim, or creating art.What kind of camp do you want to go to? I was thinking maybe a sports camp or a science camp since that's what you're interested in.""
Once you've done your research and found options for camp, pick the top three and ask your child where they would want to go.;
, Assess your child's maturity level and choose a camp that has a program that will fit their needs. For example, day camp engages children during the day and then they go home for the night. Resident or sleep away camp, on the other hand, have the children stay overnight for an extended period.Think about whether your child likes to do a variety of things or would rather go to a more specialized camp.
Consider your child's maturity level and how comfortable they feel being away from home.
Think of the location of the camp as well. For instance, if your child does not do well in the cold or has allergies to trees, you'll want to find a camp that can accommodate their needs.

, Camps can vary in size from anywhere to 10-20 campers all the way up to over 400 campers.Talk to your child and determine how they learn, and what environment may suit them the best.


You can say something like, ""I'm trying to figure out what camp to send you to. Would you rather go somewhere with a lot of kids or do you want to go somewhere that has as many kids as your class at school?""
Smaller camps may be able to give your child the specialized attention that they need.
Larger camps immerse children in large social situations that require them to make friends.

, Ask the camp director or look on the camp's website to see if transportation, meals, insurance, special trips, entrance fees, health services, or use of equipment is included in the tuition.Make sure to allocate special money for additional costs. If the camp you are researching can't meet all of your child's health needs then you'll have set up special arrangements with the camp staff.


If your child has special dietary or health needs, check to see if the camp you have in mind has the capability to meet them., Children with special needs may require a specialized camp that can cater to their disability. If your child has a disability, decide whether they can go to a mainstream camp, or whether you should find a camp that caters to their specific needs. If your child has a disability, it's important that you speak with camp staff before registering them.

If your child has special dietary or health needs, check to see if the camp you have in mind has the capability to care for them properly., When considering summer camps make sure to choose one that is within your budget. Once you find camps that fit your child's needs, take a look at how much they cost weekly. Many camps also have financial aid for low-income families.Day camp can cost anywhere from $100 to $500 a week.
Specialized summer camps that teach children new skills like sports, science, or the performing arts can cost anywhere from $500 to $1,000 per week.
The average cost of sleepaway camp is $690 per week., A good way to get reviews on camps is to talk to other parents that have sent their children to camp in previous summers. Sometimes, they will be able to share experiences and give you insight into how the camp normally operates. They can also tell you if the experience was enriching or educational for their child.


If another parent gives a camp a horrible review or has had a bad experience, it may be a good idea to consider a different camp.

, Make sure that the camp program doesn't interfere with any family vacations or commitments your child has for the summer. It's best to start early when searching for camps. Often, registration deadlines will be earlier in the year. Make sure that you're still able to register, and talk to your child about camp before the registration deadline hits.If you can't find any information on registration deadlines, give the camp a call and inquire there.

You'll be able to get a view of how camp counselors treat the kids and the nuances that take place in the camp day-to-day.


Call the camp and ask a staff member if you could come in and view the programs.
You can say something like, ""I planned on sending my son to this camp next summer. I was wondering if I could come look at the programs and facilities to help me make my decision.""

, See if you can speak personally with the camp director and take note of staff members attitudes towards campers. If they seem uninvested or careless, you may want to choose another camp for your child. Have an honest discussion with the director about your child's individual needs and see if their camp can provide a safe and engaging atmosphere for them.


Speak with the staff to see if they are CPR certified and have training in first aid.Camp counselors should also have undergone a background check.

",How to Make a Teepee," Traditionally, teepees were made from tanned buffalo or deer hides, which were water resistant and pliable. Since buffalo skin is relatively difficult to acquire nowadays, most modern teepees are made using canvas. Smaller teepees are difficult to manage fires in, so if you're going to build one, you might as well build one of significant size.


For a comfortably-sized teepee, you'll want a piece of canvas roughly 15 x 30 feet.;
, The two basic requirements for the teepee are some kind of covering (the canvas) and poles, about three feet longer than the width of the covering canvas. You'll need about twelve of them for a really solid teepee. The smoother the better, they're ideally several inches thick and made from lodge pole pine.


The easiest way to acquire these poles is to buy them commercially. Felling wood is also an option, but you need to make sure that you're harvesting legal wood, which can be a tricky proposition. To be safe, buy them from a dealer to ensure that they're sturdy and legal.
To prepare the poles for use, smooth out any rough patches with a pocketknife and sandpaper, and treat it with a coat of a 50/50 mixture of linseed oil and turpentine. This will ensure that your poles will be protected against the elements and will last for many years.

, If you don't have a pre-cut canvas made for a teepee, you'll need to cut your own from the canvas. Tracing a pattern onto the canvas first is the best idea, but the basic cut is a semi-circle half as wide as it is long, with notches cut toward each end on the flat side of the semi-circle, and with flaps cut from the middle of the flat side, for use as ""smoke flaps,"" and a hole for the door. You'll also need to save enough canvas for covering up the door hole when you're inside.

, Synthetic rope is not a good idea for building teepees, because it has trouble gripping the poles like natural ropes, causing slippage.


It's also good to have about 12-15 stakes for staking the bottom of the canvas to the ground, as well as the materials to make a fire. If you want an authentic teepee, get some porcupine quills or other long pins to fix the open part of the canvas covering when you assemble it.

, The teepee starts by fashioning a simple tripod with three of your poles. Lay two both flat on the ground, right next to each other and lay another across them, creating an acute angle at the top of about 30 degrees. The two poles next to each other will be your corner poles, while the crossing pole will act as the ""door pole.""


For an accurate measurement, lay out the canvas and assemble the poles on top. With the tops of the two base poles in the center of the canvas, pointing toward the center of the flat side, lay the other pole on top of it so the end on the curved side of the semicircle is about a 1/3 of the way down from the edge. That should be roughly a 30 degree angle.

, Use about six feet of your rope to tie the poles together using a clove hitch knot. You should have about five feet left on the short side and 40 feet (12.2 m) or so on the long side. Do note cut the rope. With the short end, wrap around the poles several times and then tie another clove hitch with the remaining rope. The rest of the rope will come in handy later. Keep it coiled and out of the way.

, In the location you'd like to set up your teepee, raise the poles from the jointed end by pulling the rope. Have helpers stand with their feet on the bottom end of the poles to keep them from dragging the tripod.


At this point, it should look more like a bipod. When it reaches its apex, separate the two base poles that were next to each other roughly 9 feet (2.7 m) from one another. They will be the ""back"" corners of the teepee, while the crossing pole will be the ""door pole."" It should not be, strictly speaking, symmetrical, but more of an isosceles triangle. The back corner poles should act as a cradle for the door pole, with about a foot more space from each corner pole to the door pole than between each corner pole.
Make sure all the corners of the tripod are sturdy by pulling down on the rope while standing in the center of the tripod, directly under the joining point.

, Set aside your sturdiest pole to act as your ""lift"" pole. You'll add poles by moving in a counterclockwise circle around the tripod, starting directly to the right of the door pole. The sides of the tripod between the door pole and each corner pole should have five poles each. The ""back"" side, between the two corner poles, should have four poles, plus your lift pole.


Leave space for the lift pole in the center of the back side of the teepee. There should be four poles on that side, with a gap in the middle for the lift pole. This will be used later to put the cover on the teepee.
Steadying each pole at the base with your foot in an arcing line with the corner poles and door pole, gently let the top of the pole come to rest in the V created by both of the corner poles.
The distance between all the poles, evenly spaced, should be about 3 feet (0.9 m).

, Using the long end of the rope, walk the rope around the crossing joint of all the poles about 4 times. Let the remainder of the rope hang at one of the corner poles.

, With the canvas on the ground, lay the pole down the center of the covering, with the tip pointed toward the center of the flat side of the semicircle. If you've bought your canvas pre-cut, there should be a small ""life pole flap"" in the center of the canvas with which you'll affix the canvas to the pole.


It's important to tie the canvas very tightly to the lift pole. If the life pole flap slips even a couple of inches, the canvas will wrinkle and cause the teepee to be uneven and loose, losing some of its valuable heat benefits. To be sure it doesn't slip, hammer an inch-long tack through the knot and the lift pole flap.

, While the canvas is still on the ground and now that your lift pole is affixed, roll up the edges toward the pole. Roll up a little at a time, as if you were folding a flag, so that the canvas will be able to unroll easily and evenly when you raise the lift pole.


Raise the entire bundle in the air and place it into the gap you've left on the back wall of the teepee for the lift pole.

, When the pole is placed, unroll the canvas around the frame of poles from the back wall to the initial door pole. Make sure the smoke flaps on the canvas are unrolled outward, as well, and bind them together. The teepee should look mostly completed at this point.

, Most commercial teepees will have holes built into the opening flaps, but if you've cut your canvas yourself you'll need to use the pins you've gathered to auger holes into the cover and pin the open side of the canvas together.


Porcupine quills can work, and were used traditionally, but small wooden pins are a more durable and available choice. They're available anywhere that also retails lodge pole pine poles.

, It's smart to secure the canvas to the ground using traditional metal tent stakes, so strong winds won't turn your teepee into a parachute. When you're ready to go inside, fix the door to the outside and you're ready to camp plains-style.


If you want to have a fire in your teepee, you'll need to open the smoke flaps or you'll hotbox the teepee and risk a fire. Plant stakes on the door-side of the teepee to fix the ropes to when you've opened them, to keep them from flapping back closed while your fire is lit.
Be very careful if you want to start a fire during cold weather. It'll be a great source of heat, and your tent will be toasty in no time, but make sure it's centrally placed, under the smoke flaps, and keep active watch on it at all times.

Make a tent with only one tree.",How to Make a Tent," Building a quick and easy makeshift tent doesn't require a lot, but you'll need a few things. Make sure you have a long piece of heavy-duty rope, two tarps, and either four stakes, or large rocks in your surroundings.;
, Find a location near two trees that are close enough to tie your rope between but far enough to fit your tarps. You want to make sure you build your tent at a lower elevation. An elevation that is too high becomes extremely cold during the evening.If the weather calls for rain, avoid building your tent in a steep valley that will collect water.
Avoid building your tent directly beneath dead or weak branches that look like they could fall in a storm.

, This will prevent dust from blowing around when you are trying to make a tent and build a shelter. It will also help the tarp adhere to the ground more efficiently, since materials tend to adhere better to damp surfaces.

, Make sure to wrap it around a few times before tying the knot. Take the other end of the rope and tie it to the other tree. Make sure you tie the rope high enough so that your tent won't be too cramped.If your rope is tied to high, then your tarp walls won't be able to reach the ground. Err on the cautious side and tie your rope a good amount lower than half of the length of your tarps.

, Make sure you remove any large rocks, pebbles and twigs from the ground before placing the bottom tarp on the ground. You want your floor tarp to go on relatively smooth ground that is free of anything that might poke holes in it.

, Smooth it out and remove all of the wrinkles. It should be directly beneath the rope you've hung between the trees. Try to place it so that it's centered beneath the rope above it.

, If your tarp has holes for stakes in its corners, you can use stakes to secure it to the ground. Place a stake through one of the holes and use either a heavy rock or a hammer to hammer it into the ground. Then do the same with an adjacent corner, making sure to stretch the tarp tight before staking it. Finish the other corners.


Don't hammer the stakes in too deeply yet, as you will redo them when you construct the walls of your tent.
If you don't have stakes, or your tarp doesn't have holes for stakes, use heavy rocks instead to secure it to the ground.

, Throw your other tarp over the rope you tied in between the trees. Straighten it out so that the tarp hangs evenly down. If the tarp barely reaches the ground or doesn't even touch it, you've tied your rope too high., If you've secured the first tarp with stakes, remove one stake, then line up the holes in the two tarps, and hammer the stake back into the ground. Repeat with the other corners one by one. If you've secured the first tarp with rocks, just lift each rock and place the corners of the wall tarp under them so that the rocks hold both tarps in place., If you're worried about potential rain flooding your tent, you can keep out water with rocks and dirt. Just use whatever you can find around you, sticks, rocks, and dirt, to build a small wall around your tent's floor tarp.Alternatively, if your tent is on a slope, you can dig trenches around both sides of your tent using a small shovel or a sharp rock, which will help rain flow around your tent instead of into it.

, If you don't have two tarps, but the one you have is large enough, you can make a tent with floor and roof with the single tarp. Lay the tarp on the ground beneath the rope. Place two rocks on two corners, and two rocks in the center of the tarp at the edges. Throw the edge of the tarp not held down over the rope, and then secure that edge right on top of the opposite edge of the tarp with the same rocks.

, If you want to secure your tent with stakes but you don't have any with you, you can use broken tree branches. Take a knife and whittle one end of four branches down to a point.


You'll need to find branches that are thin enough to fit through the stake holes in the tarps but thick enough to not break. If you can snap it easily with your hands it's probably not strong enough.

, If you can't find two trees that are a good distance apart, you can make a tent of a different shape with one tree. You'll need stakes and a tarp with holes for stakes for this method. Using your rope, tie one corner of the tarp to the tree. Then just stretch out the tarp and stake the other corners into the ground.If you have another tarp you can stake it to the ground beneath the roof tarp. Use the same stakes and drive them through both tarps, with the corners lined up. Then take one more stake to secure the corner of the floor tarp that is closest to the tree.

Get your milk carton.,
Wrap your hot dogs.,
Place your hot dogs in the milk carton.,
Light your milk carton on fire.,
Wait for the milk carton to burn.",How to Cook a Hot Dog in a Milk Carton," You will need paper milk cartons such as the one pictured. Do not use plastic milk cartons or plastic juice jugs. Any cartons with a plastic tops that twist off will not burn as effectively as ones with just a gable-top.;
, Take your hot dog wiener and wrap it up in tin foil, making sure that the shiny side is facing towards the wiener, and the matte side of the tin foil is facing the outside. Having the shiny side facing the wiener will help it cook better. To keep your hot dog from burning, wrap your tin foil around it three times.

, Once you've wrapped your hot dogs, put them into the milk carton. If you have a 1-litre (1 quart) milk carton, you can put 1-3 hot dogs inside of it. If you have a 2-litre (2 quart) milk carton, you can put 1-5 hot dogs inside of it.

, Place your milk carton in a fireplace, campfire pit, or another safe place away from trees and grass that could be accidentally lit on fire, then light the carton. The cartons can be tricky to light, so it's a good idea to use long fireplace matches or long lighters when lighting so that you can keep the flame on the carton for longer without worrying about burning your fingers.

, Once you've got the milk carton lit, wait for it to completely burn. Once it's burned until there's no milk carton left, your hot dog is done! Carefully remove it from the tin foil (it will be very hot), and enjoy!

Build an even, low temperature fire.,
Bring water to a boil.,
Add rice and cook uncovered for 12-14 minutes.,
Remove from heat if the temperature gets too high.,
The rice is ready to eat but there's still water left.,
The rice is still chewy and hard when it should be ready.,
The rice has burned!,
Rice frequently burns.",How to Cook Rice Over a Fire," Don't use a roaring hot fire with licking flames, just one that can boil water. Keep moving the coals around to maintain as constant a temperature as you can.;
, Use four times as much water as rice by volume.(You need more than the rice can absorb because much of it will boil off.)

, Compared to a stovetop, the higher temperature will cook the rice faster, but the rice will lose some nutrients and fluffiness. On the bright side, it's easy to check on your rice frequently using this method.


Just as with any rice, you can add spices, butter, and salt to make it more exciting.

, If you are having trouble controlling your fire, the rice can continue to cook off the flames for a few minutes, especially if you cover the pot.

, Drain the rice in a colander or carefully tip most of the water out, using a wooden spoon to keep the rice in.

, Add more water if it's boiled off and cook a few minutes longer.

, Remove from heat and run cold water on the outside of the pot to stop the rice cooking. Remove the good rice from the center.

, Boil the rice uncovered for 6 or 7 minutes, then remove it from the heat entirely and cover with a tightly fitting lid. The steam should finish cooking the rice in 10–15 minutes with no risk of burning.

Make seating that beats the rocks.,
Obtain and carry a very lightweight door mat.",How to Make a Camp Tent More Comfortable," Whether at a campsite or back country, the ground upon which you set up your tent affects the comfort levels dramatically. Look for a site that is level, free of jutting objects such as rocks, branches or tree roots and isn't too near water (wind blowing across water increases the chill factor inside the tent).
,, Decide how much shade you may get at different times of the day before setting up your tent., Cramming too many people into a small tent is a recipe for discomfort. Always choose a tent that states clearly that it can carry the amount of people you intend to fit inside it. Err on the side of generous, especially if you like to include creature comforts such as additional pillows, books to read, games to play, etc. and you'd like some space between each other.

Bring several tents along if needed. It is better to set up a shared camping area than to sleep on top of each other. Besides, you can always have the fun of creating your own space outside the tent area as well.
Check that the tent is weather resistant. If you've had it for a few years, check for holes, weathered areas, broken items and mold. All of these things need to be fixed.

, This protects the tent floor, creates an additional layer between you and the hard, cold and wet ground and can help to keep the tent clean.

The moisture barrier can be a simple and inexpensive plastic painter's drop cloth. The function of the moisture barrier is to prevent ground water vapor from the seeping up into your dry tent.

, This prevents the rain and dew from ruining your camping trip., Spread the moisture barrier or tarpaulin sheet in an area slightly smaller than the footprint of your tent., See that the doors and windows will be where you want them. Keep everything as flat and smooth as possible. Make adjustments now, as it will be difficult to move the tent after the stakes are in.

Ensure that the moisture barrier is completely covered by the tent. If the moisture barrier extends further than the tent, it will become a moisture carrier... catching rain or dew and carrying the water into pools inside your tent. You don't want that to happen.

,, If you have space in the car, also throw in the gym mats or outdoor lounge chair mats, for added padding over the top of the inflatable mattress. If it's comfort you're after, there's no such thing as too much padding., Put an older cover on it, to protect it. Even better, keep single bed duvets just for camping trips––cheap ones are just perfect for this, even the polyester filled ones. Place the duvets over the top of the sleeping bags for additional warmth and plenty of comfort.

Blankets are okay too, if you prefer them or want them as well as a duvet. Single bed or even baby blankets are ideal inside a tent.

, Bring at least one per person, or more if there's space. Pillows can double up as seat cushions during the day time. Bring plenty of pillowcases to keep things clean., Wrap yourself up in some thread count 500 inside the sleeping bag. Ooooh, cozy!, Why not? You're trying to be comfortable, after all. Hang some multi-colored ribbons or streamers from the roof or at the entrance, for a zap of color and fun., If you're in a large tent, the kind you can walk around in and that has several rooms, be sure to set up ample ""real living space"", just like at home. Include a pantry (these can hang or can be formed as little cupboards) and fill with food, but only if you're away from bear country. Otherwise, keep your food in the car or locked away in provided lockers.

Place cushions on the chairs and a rug or two on the tent floor.
Skip this step if you don't have enough room in your tent.

,,

These can be fun, party lanterns, or normal camping ones.

, Flashlights, LED lamps, headlamps and the like are perfect for inside the tent. Avoid gas lamps in the tent––keep these for outside the tent areas, where it's safer. There are so many good LED solutions on the market now, that it's very affordable to have the appropriate lighting inside tents., Pack enough tiles to fit the inside dimensions of your tent. You will likely need 4 packs of foam tiles.

Do a test run at home to see how many foam tiles are needed for your tent.

,, Usually, each square covers 11 or 12 square inches. Therefore, an assembled set of 8 should be almost 2 feet (0.6 m) by 4 feet (1.2 m). If your room is 8 feet (2.4 m) across, you will need to assemble about four sets., You should find that the sleeping area is extremely comfortable and cozy, as well as insulated against the ground. All this, for very little cost, weight and effort!, Avoiding carrying too much gear should be your primary concern, not ""glamping"". Nevertheless, it is possible to improve the comfort of your experience with just some simple changes., While costly, these are worthy the expenditure when you get a much more comfortable night's sleep. They not only provide padding but also help to insulate you against the rising damp from the ground under your sleeping bag., This can help you rest more easily at night and it neither weighs too much, nor takes up a lot of space. Various brands make these tiny camping pillows––look for a drawstring with a stopper that helps you to compress the pillow's size as much as possible., Clothing can be lain upon underneath the sleeping bag, it can be stuffed inside a jacket or pillow case to form a pillow and it can be used to keep drafts at bay. Everything must do double duty when you're packing light, so make the most of those clothes to increase your comfort––wrinkles are the least of your concerns when back country.,

Get a mat convertor. This will allow you to turn your sleeping mat into a chair for daytime use, which can be a lot more comfortable than sitting on the ground or rocks. These don't weigh a lot and are easy to fit into the backpack.
Use your backpack to lean against or sit on. If it has gear in it still, use a jacket or other clothing item to soften the gear, then make use of the backpack to lean on or even sit on, if the gear isn't breakable.

, Dollar store mats are ideal as they're cheap, tiny and light. While you'd probably not bother with such a cheap mat in your home, they're great for camping precisely because of their budget qualities, allowing you to place them in the tent flap entrance as a place to put your feet to remove and put boots on in comfort, avoiding wet grass or ground. This helps to keep the dirt and damp out of the sleeping area of your tent."

Choose the right plant.,
Place a plastic bag over a leafy branch.,
Secure the bag around around the branch, stem, or trunk.,
Position the bag properly.,
Let the plant sit for several hours.,
Unwrap the bag.",How to Collect Water From Plants1," You should use a healthy, intact plant that is actively growing because a dead or dormant plant will not provide water vapor that you can collect. Plants that are water-loving, such as willows or cottonwoods, are the best option, but you can use any variety with leaves.The larger the leaves on your plant are the better. That’s because a large leaf surface will usually produce more water vapor than plants with small leaves.;
, Make sure to cover as much of the live plant as the bag can accommodate. For the best results, use a clear bag that allows light to pass through it. The added heat will help extract moisture from the plant.Check your bag to make sure that there aren’t any holes or tears that might allow air inside. If you find one, cover the tear with a piece of strong tape, such as vinyl duct tape.

, Ensure that the seal is as airtight as possible. It helps to tie several layers of the bag off with string, making sure that there aren’t any gaps around the base of the plant., You want at least a portion of it to be lower than the seal around the base of the plant. That’s because the water will gather in the lowest portion of the bag, so you want to give it room to collect.You want to be sure that the plant and bag can bear the weight of any water that’s collected, so check that they’re not starting to list to the side before the water vapor begins to gather.

, It usually takes four to five hours for water to start to collect in the bag. To help the process along, set the plant near a window or under a lamp, so it can receive light to help heat up the inside of the bag., You’ll be able to tell when there’s water in the bag for you to collect, but you have to undo the seal carefully to ensure that you don’t spill any. Pour the water into a glass, bowl, or other container for you to use.You may not get as much water as you want even after several hours. If that's the case, reseal the bag over the plant and repeat the process.

Cut a section of the plant.,
Squeeze or smash until water comes out.,
Catch water in a container.",How to Collect Water From Plants2," The moist, pulpy center of stems, leaves, and stalks contain water, so you can either slice off part of the plant to work with or make a notch in a stalk at the base of the joint.A small pocket knife works best for cutting into a plant because you can be more precise, and avoid cutting any more than is necessary.

, With some plants, moisture may flow from it as soon as you cut it. However, some species require that you squeeze or press the leaves or stems to get the water to flow. You’ll need to press on the moist pulp inside to access the liquid. Sucking water directly from plant isn’t a good idea because the exterior of the leaves, stems, or stalks may contain bacteria, dirt, and other debris.
Be careful if you’re trying to extract moisture from a cactus.They are a great source of water, but their prickly exterior can be hard on your hands if you need to squeeze out the liquid.

, It’s best to examine the liquid that comes out of the plant to ensure that it’s water and not potentially poisonous. Let the liquid fall into a bowl or cup so you can check its color and texture.If the liquid that comes out of your plant has a milky color and a sap-like consistency, don’t drink it. It’s usually poisonous.Keep in mind that a single leaf, stem, or stalk may not contain much water, so you may need to extract liquid from several pieces of the plant to get as much water as you'd like.

Center the hoop along that edge with about three inches (7.6 cm) of fabric between the two., Fold those three inches of fabric over the hoop’s closest end, so that its patterned side is now facing up. Now cut off a strip of duct tape. Tape the sheet’s edge to where it meets the underside, inside the hoop, creating a loop around the hoop., Choose either corner of the same edge to start. Pull it over the hoop until it’s opposite from where you taped the middle. Feed about three inches of the corner under the hoop and line it up with the sheet’s other edge. Pinch the two together and use another strip of tape to create another loop. Then repeat with the other corner., At this point, it may be easier to set the hoop on two sawhorses (or something similar) so you can kneel or stand in the middle. Starting from either corner, continue pulling about three inches of fabric over the top of the hoop, taping its edge to the sheet’s underside, until you reach where you placed your first piece of tape. Repeat along the other side until you’ve created a continuous loop around the whole hoop., Think of your hoop as a compass, with a north, south, east, and west pole (with your tent’s open flaps being one of those poles). Use a small knife, scissors, or something similar to poke holes through the duct tape and sheet at each pole. Make each just large enough to thread your twine through. Make at least a total of five holes (with one through each flap of your tent’s opening) so that weight is distributed evenly when hung., Cut five equal lengths of twine, one for each hole. Exactly how long doesn’t really matter, as long as they’re long enough to reach the binder ring when centered over the hoop and hung from the ceiling. Tie one end of each length to the ring, then thread the other end through a hole and tie it around the hoop.Twine can unravel over time, but you can prevent these by wrapping each end with duct tape.

, Install a hook into your ceiling. Cut one more length of twine and tie one end to the hook. Again, exact length doesn’t matter, as long as it’s short enough to keep the tent’s bottom from bunching on the floor. Tie the length’s other end to the book ring, and your tent is ready for use!If you want to hang it outside, no need for a hook. Simply tie one end of your last piece of twine around a tree branch or similar object.

"
"
Drill holes in your hoop.,
Fit one binder ring through all your curtains’ holes.,
Thread equal lengths of rope through the holes.,
Hang your curtains over the hoop.,
Hang your tent from the ceiling.",How to Make a Hula Hoop Tent2," Use a drill bit large enough for your nylon rope to fit through. Drill four holes at equidistant points along your hoop. Think of it in terms of a compass, with one hole at north, south, east, and west., The larger your binder ring, the easier this will be. Starting at one end of your first shower curtain, pass the ring through the curtain’s first hole. Bunch the curtain up and hook the second hole onto the ring. Continue until all holes have been hooked, then begin again with the second curtain. Close the ring when finished.This can be tough, so if you need more than two hands to keep the curtains bunched up as you work, ask for help.

, Cut four equal lengths of nylon rope, one for each drilled hole in your hoop. Thread each one through the hole. Then pull half of the length through.Exact length doesn’t matter. You just want them short enough to keep the shower curtains from bunching up on the floor when your tent is hung.

, First, pinch all the loose ends from your nylon rope together. Thread these through the binder ringer from underneath the bunched curtains. Once the rope’s free ends pass up through the binder, pull them taut and twist them together to form one big rope. Use this to tie a knot, while leaving enough rope above the knot to hang your tent from a ceiling hook., Install a hook in your ceiling. Twist the loose ends of rope back into one big rope and tie it into a second knot, as close as you can to its very end. Hook a second binder ring through the rope underneath this top knot. Close the ring and hook that over the ceiling hook."
"
Add bunting along the hoop.,
Create seals.,
Add lighting.",How to Make a Hula Hoop Tent3," Choose the fabric of your choice to accent your tent’s color(s), patterns, and/or textures. Cut it into triangles or any other shape that pleases you. Attach adhesive velcro strips to the backs of these. Attach corresponding strips along your tent, over the hula hoop. Then simply press the two strips together to attach your bunting., Give yourself the ability to close your tent’s flap. Attach adhesive velcro strips along the edge of one flap, facing inside. Then, for each strip used, attach a corresponding one on the inside of your other’s flaps edge. Pinch the strips together to keep the flaps from whipping open when you’d rather seal yourself off from the world., Use adhesive strips or tape to line the hoop with strands or strips of decorative lights on the inside and/or outside of your tent (like Christmas, star, or fairy lights).However, be sure to use LED lights. Avoid using other bulbs, like incandescent ones, since these emit far more heat and pose a fire risk."

Check the long-range forecast before deciding a date, and try to choose a day that has no chance of rain or storms.
To make sure you and your guests have lots of time to prepare, start planning your barbecue at least two weeks in advance.;
, Your cookout can be as big or small as you like, and you can invite anybody you want. Some people you might want to consider, include friends, family, neighbors, co-workers, and classmates.


Remember that the more people you invite, the more food you'll have to prepare.

, The invitations don’t have to be formal or even written, but you should give guests plenty of warning so they can plan to attend.On the invitation, you may want to ask guests to inform you about dietary restrictions. The invitations should include the event type, date, time, and location. There are lots of ways you can invite your guests, including:


Formal written invitations
Evites
An email with all the details
A phone call to each person

, Having a guest list is essential not only so you know who’s coming, but also so you know how much food to purchase and prepare. On written invitations, write a date by which you want guests to respond. On the phone simply ask guests to tell you by a certain day if they can make it.


The RSVP deadline should be at least a few days before the cookout so that you know how much food to buy.
As guests RSVP, make a note of who is and isn't coming.

, Go through your kitchen, barbecue tools, cupboards, and party gear and make a list of things you need for the cookout (other than food). Things you may need include:Plates
Utensils
Napkins
Barbecue fuel
Barbecue utensils
Decorations
Tablecloths
Aluminum foil

, Food is one of the most important elements of a cookout, and there are lots of different courses to consider. You can start planning the menu before you have a finalized guest list, but you'll have to determine quantities later. Popular appetizers and snacks for barbecues include:


Fresh fruitFresh vegetables with dip
Chips
Guacamole, The main course at a cookout is typically a red meat dish, but it can also be poultry, fish, or a plant-based protein. Pick a food that you really like, and that will also be popular with your guests. Good options include:


SteakRibs
Hamburgers
Hot dogs
Sausages
Kebabs
Shrimp
Pork butt
BrisketTofu
Portobello mushrooms

, There are lots of popular side dishes you can serve at a cookout. You can pick your favorites, try to pair the sides with the main you're serving. For instance, if you're serving something lighter like shrimp or mushrooms, you might want a heavier side like potatoes. Popular cookout sides are:


Roasted vegetables, such as asparagus, zucchini, and bell peppers
ColeslawPotato salad
Corn on the cob
Baked potatoes
Salad
Pasta salad

, Dessert isn't necessary at a cookout, but it’s a nice touch. You can either go simple and opt for things like cookies, fruit, or ice cream. Other options include cake, brownies, cupcakes, squares, and marshmallow treats., Beverages can be simple like pop, juice, and beer, or you can even have a themed drink or cocktail for the cookout. It’s good to have a variety of drinks to accommodate kids, people who don’t drink, and people with beverage preferences. Here are some drink ideas:Lemonade
Punch
Iced tea
Sangria
Wine
Margaritas
Mojitos
Soda

, It’s possible that not all your guests will want to or be able to eat the food you’ve decided in your meal plan. One way to accommodate dietary restrictions is to offer a number of different dishes, including different meat options and a vegetarian option.Check your RSVPs to determine if any of your guests listed allergies or restrictions.

, Cookouts are fairly informal gatherings, and it’s totally acceptable to hold a potluck-style barbecue. Especially if you're having a lot of people come, don’t be afraid to ask guests to bring a dish so that you don’t have to worry about it.


The custom is typically that the host will provide the main dish, and can ask guests to bring sides, appetizers, snacks, and desserts., Once you’ve decided on all your menu items and your drinks, make a list of all the food, spices, and condiments you need for your snacks, main, sides, dessert, and drinks. To help plan the quantity of food, each guest will consume, on average:Two beverages when they arrive, followed by one more every hour
6 to 8 ounces (170 to 227 g) of meat
1 cup (150 g) of pasta salad or potato salad
1 cup (100 g) of coleslaw
1 to 2 cups (75 to 150 g) of salad
Two pieces of fruit
4 ounces (113 g) of cake or cookies

, One or two days before the barbecue, grab your shopping list and your reusable bags and head out to grab all the things you need for the cookout.


There may be things you need that you didn’t already put on the list, including ice, sauces, barbecue fuel, and other miscellaneous items.

, At least 48 hours before the cookout, remove frozen meat and veggies from the freezer to thaw them. Place them in the refrigerator to thaw. Don’t leave items on the counter, as they will be prone to food-borne diseases.


The meat may only need 24 hours to thaw, but thawing it early will give you time to marinate it the night before the barbecue.

, Remove the grills from the barbeque and soak them in a bucket of soapy water. Wipe down the barbecue itself to remove food crumbs and oil. After the grills have soaked for at least 10 minutes, scrub them with a non-abrasive scrubbing pad.


Return the grills to the barbecue and let them air dry. When they are dry, use a clean cloth to rub some cooking oil on them., The night before the barbecue, you can do a lot of food prep work. This includes making side dishes, making desserts, washing and cutting fruit and vegetables, and marinating meat. Transfer side dishes and chopped fruit and veggies to airtight containers for storage., The morning of the cookout, fill a cooler with ice and put drinks in there that should be served cold. This includes beer, pop, juice, and other drinks that people typically don’t like warm., You may want to dust, vacuum, clean the bathrooms, and tidy the patio before your guests arrive. People probably won’t be spending too much time inside, but it will be nice to have a clean house regardless.


To clean the patio, wipe down any outdoor furniture, remove items that don’t have to be there, and sweep or power wash the deck or patio.

, You don’t have to decorate for a cookout, but you certainly can. There are lots of decorations you can use, including flowers, plants, balloons, streamers, lights, torches, candles, and even special table cloths., Because barbecues are informal, guests usually take care of serving themselves food and drinks. Set up a large table with napkins, plates, utensils, and cups.When the guests start to arrive, you can put out snacks and drinks (ones that aren't in the cooler).


When the food is ready, place the side dishes and mains on the table as well, along with serving utensils so that guests can get their own food.

, Before guests arrive, place a large garbage can outside with a fresh garbage bag in it. This will give guests a place to put trash, make your job easier, and make it so guests don’t have to go inside.


This is especially important if you're using disposable serving ware and utensils.

, About an hour before guests are set to arrive, turn on the barbecue and preheat it for your food. This will make sure the grill is nice and hot and ready to go as soon as your guests arrive. When the grill is hot, put on long-cooking side dishes like baked potatoes and corn on the cob.


Side dishes like corn and potatoes should go on the grill 30 to 60 minutes before you plan to eat., As soon as your first guests get there and lunch or dinnertime arrives, move your corn and potatoes off the grill and start cooking the main dish.


To keep the sides warm while everything else cooks, wrap them in foil.

, Once the food is ready, put the side dishes, appetizers, and main food on the table so that guests can serve themselves and dress their food. Now that all the hard work is out of the way, it’s time to enjoy your cookout!

Avoid ever having to use this method without careful planning.,
Find a plant that is plentiful.,
Abstain from eating or drinking anything but purified water for 8 hours before the test.,
Separate the plant into parts.,
Find out if the plant is contact-poisonous.,
Cook a small portion of the plant part.,
Test the plant in your mouth.,
Wait 8 hours.,
Eat 1/4 cup of the same kind of plant part prepared the same way.,
Wait an additional 8 hours.,
Begin a new test if the plant part you have chosen fails any of the tests.,
Do a gradual test if you have other food sources.",How to Test if a Plant Is Edible1," Some plants can be deadly, and even if you follow these guidelines perfectly, there is always a chance that a plant will make you seriously ill.


Prepare yourself for wilderness outings by learning about the local flora and fauna, and carry a guidebook or taxonomic key to help you identify plants.
Even if you are unprepared and cannot find food you know to be safe remember that, depending on your activity level, the human body can go for days without food, and you're better off being hungry than being poisoned.;
, You don't want to go through the rigorous process of testing a plant if there's not a lot of it to eat.

, (If you have to use this method, this step will probably be unavoidable.)

, Some plants have edible parts and poisonous parts. In order to test if a plant is edible, you must separate it into the leaf, stem, and root and test each part separately for edibility.


After you have separated the plant into parts, inspect each part you are preparing for parasites. If you encounter worms or small insects inside the plant, discontinue the test with that sample and consider seeking a different sample of the same plant. Evidence of worms, parasites or insects indicates that the plant is rotten, especially if the organism has vacated the plant.
Many parts of plants are only edible during certain seasons (for example, acorns collected after the fall are usually rotten). If you find grubs inside the plant, the plant is rotting, but the grubs are edible and contain high amounts of protein (although they taste sour and are gritty).

, A contact-poisonous plant is one that causes a reaction merely by touching your skin. Rub the selected plant part on the inside of your elbow or wrist. Crush it so that the sap touches your skin, and hold it there for 15 minutes. If the plant causes a reaction in the next 8 hours, do not continue testing that part of that plant.


Do this with each part of the plant until you find a part that isn't contact-poisonous.

, Some plants are poisonous only when raw, so it's a good idea to cook the plant part you are testing if possible. If you can't cook the plant or if you don't anticipate that you will be able to cook it in the future, just test it raw.

, This portion of the test is where things get dangerous, so proceed very slowly and carefully. Take the following steps to test the plant in your mouth:

Hold a small portion of the prepared plant part against your lip for 3 minutes. Do not put the plant in your mouth. If you notice any burning, tingling, or other reaction, discontinue testing.






Place another small portion of the plant part on your tongue. Hold the plant on your tongue without chewing for 15 minutes. Discontinue testing if you notice any reaction.






Chew the plant and hold it in your mouth for 15 minutes. Chew the plant well, and do not swallow. Discontinue testing if you notice any reaction.






Swallow the small portion of the plant.







, Do not eat or drink anything during this period except purified water. If you feel sick, immediately induce vomiting and drink plenty of water. If activated charcoal is available, take that with the water. Discontinue testing if you experience any adverse reaction.

, It is critical that you use exactly the same part of exactly the same kind of plant, and that you prepare it in exactly the same way as you did the initial sample.

, Abstain from any other food except purified water. Induce vomiting immediately as above if you should feel ill. If no reaction has occurred, you may assume only that particular part of the plant is safe to eat, and only as prepared during the test.

, If the first plant part you choose appears contact-poisonous, you may immediately test a new plant on your other arm or behind your knee. If the plant causes a reaction before you have swallowed it, wait until the symptoms have disappeared before testing a new plant. If you have an adverse reaction after you've swallowed the plant, wait until symptoms have disappeared and start a new test. Although there may be edible parts of the plant you initially chose, it is preferable to move on to a different plant for subsequent tests.

, If you are in a situation where you have access to other sources of safe food, you can incorporate this test into your diet more gradually by splitting it up into 3 stages, and using your 8 hours of normal sleep as the 8 hours of the pre-test for each stage. Again, this should only be used if you are in a survival situation (e.g. your existing food rations are running low, and you need to start testing another source before your current one is depleted) or if you cannot find documentation for a particular plant and are willing to undergo the risks (poisoning and death) involved.


Wake up and do the contact-poisonous part of the test. After 8 hours, eat a normal meal (not of the plant under test).
Next morning, complete the test up to swallowing a single piece. After 8 hours, assuming you are still alive and well, eat a normal meal again.
Eat the full sample of the plant under test on the 3rd morning. After 8 hours, celebrate life and the adding of a new edible plant to your experience by eating a nice meal.
Don't disregard any other steps, or tips, or warnings; this alternative method is only to save your body from the stress of 24 hours of fasting. This method also enables you to continually test new plants in your area without going hungry for more than 16 hours a day, and only 8 hours on the final day, assuming 1/4 cup of the food can sustain you.

Know the signs of a poisonous plant.,
Look for recognizable edible plants.,
Don't forget seaweed.",How to Test if a Plant Is Edible2," Some plants that are poisonous look, smell and taste completely edible, but others provide signs that they aren't to be eaten by humans. Avoiding plants with these qualities might cause you to miss out on a plant that's actually edible, but it's much better to play it safe. Stay away from plants with the following characteristics:White berries.
Milky sap.
An almond scent.
Seeds, beans or bulbs inside pods.
Thorns, spines or hairs.
A bitter taste.
Grain heads with pink or black spurs.
Groups of three leaves.

, If you know what you're looking for, you're likely to find some plants that you recognize from the produce aisle of the grocery store. Do not eat any unfamiliar berries that you see unless you are 100% sure that the berry is edible unless you are willing to risk illness and death. Every plant you encounter in the wild should be tested according to the above method since some poisonous plants look very similar to edible ones. However, plants that look like the following common edible plants are a good place to start:Blueberries
Blackberries
Dandelion
Asparagus
Strawberries
Wild onion
Persimmon
Chestnut
Bananas
Mangos
Coconuts
Papaya
Taro
Cactus

, Seaweed is a nutritious plant source that is edible as long as it's harvested fresh from the ocean. Don't attempt to eat seaweed that has washed up on the shore. If you can wade out a bit and harvest some fresh seaweed, you'll have a good food source that provides minerals and vitamin C. These common seaweeds are edible:Kelp
Green seaweed
Irish moss
Dulse
Laver

Fill the oranges with batter.,
Wrap the oranges in foil.,
Place the oranges onto the coals.,
Bake the oranges.,
Serve hot.",How to Bake a Cake Inside a Hollowed Orange over a Campfire," Rinse the whole oranges under running water. Use a vegetable brush to scrub the skins and remove any dirt or particles. Pat the oranges dry, and then use a sharp knife to cut the top quarters off each orange.

Depending on the size of the oranges, you may be cutting off the top 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of each orange.Only use as many oranges as you want to make cakes. The cake batter recipe will make enough for eight oranges, but you can reserve leftover cake batter for something else.;
, Use a grapefruit knife or another small knife to cut the flesh of the orange away from the insides of the skin. Cut as close to the skin as you can without cutting into it. Do this with the bottom and cap of each orange., Once you’ve cut the flesh away from the skin, you can use a spoon to scoop out the fruit. Use the spoon to dig away any fruit that may still be stuck to the skin. When you're done, you'll have oranges and caps that are completely hollowed out.You can eat the fruit that you remove from the orange, use it to make juice, or transfer it to an airtight container to eat later.

, In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisking will help to remove lumps from the dry ingredients, and make for a smoother cake batter.

Instead of whisking, you can combine the ingredients in a sifter and sift them into the mixing bowl.
To make a chocolate mocha cake, add 1 teaspoon (5 g) of espresso powder to the mix as well., Crack the eggs into a small bowl, and then transfer them to the mixing bowl with the dry ingredients. Add the milk, oil, and vanilla. Beat the mixture with a hand mixer on medium speed for two minutes.Use a whisk to combine the ingredients if you don’t have a hand mixer.
Cracking the eggs into a separate bowl will give you an opportunity to pick out any shells that fall in with the egg.

, Once you’ve added the water, beat the batter for another minute, until all the ingredients are fully incorporated. Don’t worry if the batter appears thin, because it’s supposed to be like that.

Instead of making your own chocolate cake from scratch, you can also use a prepackaged cake mix.
You can also use a brownie recipe or mix to cook in the oranges., To cook the cake in the orange on a fire, you need a bed of hot coals. Once the fire is burning hot, stop adding fuel and let the fire die down. When the flames die down and there are a lot of glowing red embers in the bottom of the pit, use a shovel or stick to rake the coals and spread them evenly over the fire pit.

The oranges will be cooked directly on the coals, so make the bed of coals as flat as possible.

, Pour enough batter into each orange to fill it three-quarters full.This will work out to about 1 cup (235 ml) of batter per orange. When the oranges are full, place the cap back on each orange.


When the batter cooks, it will rise and fill the orange.

, Tear off a square of heavy-duty aluminum foil that’s about 1 foot (30 cm) long. Wrap one of the oranges with the foil, making sure to keep the orange upright (with the cap at the top). Repeat with the other oranges.


Use two layers of aluminum foil for each orange if you're using regular-duty foil. This will help protect the oranges and cakes from burning., Use a pair of tongs to pick up one of the oranges. Place the orange down on the hot coals. Repeat with another orange, being sure to leave a few inches (several centimeters) of space between the oranges. This will prevent the coals from being smothered.

You can also cook the oranges on a barbecue if you don’t have a campfire. Place the oranges onto a grill that’s been preheated to 350 F (177 C). This is the temperature at which you'd bake the cake in an oven., Let the oranges cook on the fire for 20 to 30 minutes, turning them every 10 minutes with tongs.After 20 minutes, carefully remove one orange from the fire. Unwrap the foil, remove the cap, and insert a toothpick into the cake. The cake is done if the toothpick comes out clean.

If the toothpick comes out covered in wet cake, bake the oranges for another 10 minutes.
On a barbecue, bake the oranges for 30 to 35 minutes.

, When the cakes are cooked, use tongs to remove the oranges from the fire. Unwrap the foil and set the oranges aside to cool for at least 10 minutes. Before serving, you can remove the caps and garnish the cakes with your favorite dessert toppings, such as frosting, chocolate or caramel sauce, sprinkles, or chocolate chips.Transfer the oranges to individual servings plates. Use a fork to eat the cake directly out of the orange.

Take care when holding marshmallows above a flame.,
Eat the marshmallow.,
Roast marshmallows under the broiler.,
Toast on a gas stove instead.,
Make S'mores.,
Make a banana boat.,
Drop your marshmallows onto hot cocoa or dessert.",How to Roast Marshmallows," Ideally, start this an hour in advance so you have time to get perfect roasting coals.There are three successful ingredients to a good campfire (plus a safe fire pit and a way to light it, of course):A pile of dry tinder, such as paper, grass, dryer lint, or char cloth. If you didn't bring any and the weather is wet, collect pine cones or take shavings from inside a split log.
Small twigs to use as kindling. Build it gradually outward and upward from small to large, leaving plenty of space for air.
Dry branches about the size of your forearm, added gradually once the fire catches.;
, These should be about as long as an adult's arm, sturdy, and pointed. Try one of these:


Metal stakes or kebab sticks. These can get too hot to touch, so choose ones that are extra-long or have a wooden handle
Hardwood sticks, sap-free and whittled to a blunt point.
Storebought marshmallow roasters

, Make sure the stick goes all the way through the marshmallow to prevent slipping. If the marshmallow can slide easily along the stick, you'll have to be careful not to tip the stick down into the fire.


You can stack on several marshmallows at once, but it's easier to get a good toasted surface with just one at a time.

, Once your fire has been burning for a while, some of the wood will burn out and turn it glowing coals. A spot right above these coals is the perfect area to roast marshmallows. The heat from this makeshift oven will caramelize that sugar perfectly, and there are no gouts of fire to ruin the majestic white goo.

, Rotate the stick as you go so the heat toasts the marshmallow evenly on all sides. You'll see the outer surface turn brown as it cooks. You can either keep up a steady rotation until the marshmallow is light brown all over, or cook one side until it's done, then rotate and start again on another side.


Sometimes, the marshmallow will sag down and fail to turn when you rotate the stick. Stab it or prop it up with a second stick to fix this.

, Sticking a marshmallow into the flame will cause it to catch fire. You can blow it out, but you'll end up with a bitter, black layer of charcoal. Unless you love to set your toaster to 11, try to avoid this.


Never shake the stick or jerk it back violently when the marshmallow catches fire. Silly though it sounds, a flaming molten marshmallow can cause a painful burn., Unlike the coals, which just radiate heat, the flames also send a stream of hot gases traveling upward.This second type of heat (called convection) will burn your marshmallow much faster. So even if the flame is well below your marshmallow, you can still end up turning half of it black or even setting it on fire. Usually it's worth the extra minute or two to cook it over coals instead.

, Some people like to pull off the crisp brown layer and eat it first, then devour the hot goo inside. If your marshmallow accidentally burned black, you can pull off this layer and throw it in the fire instead. And of course, some of your friends have already finished scarfing the entire jumbo marshmallow in one bite while you were reading this.


Careful — the marshmallow will be very hot. Wait at least 30-60 seconds after pulling it out of the fire.

, European nobles probably kept a fireplace in every room just so they could eat marshmallows on a whim. In these dark days of the central heating unit, you may need to rely on your oven's broiler setting instead. Lay the marshmallows in a single layer on a foil-lined baking sheet. Place on the middle rack under the broiler and watch it like a hawk. Once they brown – within a minute or two — rotate them with a spatula and toast the other side.


Move the sheet to the upper rack if the marshmallows aren't browning.

, This method gives you the fun of holding a marshmallow roasting stick, but there are downsides. It will be difficult to get an even toast, and if you overcook them the goo can make a mess dripping on your stovetop. Hold the marshmallows at the edge of the flame to avoid dripping onto the pilot light or other mechanisms.


You can use a fork to toast them, but it may blacken if it gets too hot. And remember the fork will be scalding hot before you stick it in your mouth.

, This American classic is a kid's favorite, and super easy to make:


Break off a square of graham cracker about the size of your marshmallow. (Substitute another crisp, sweet biscuit if graham crackers are not available near you.)
Cover with a square of chocolate.
Drop the fresh-toasted marshmallow onto the chocolate.
Press down with a second piece of graham cracker, squishing the hot marshmallow down. This will partially melt the chocolate and make a delicious, gooey mess.

, Here's another quirky way to enjoy your marshmallows:


Slice a long slit through the skin of a banana.
Scoop out a trench from the banana along this slit.
Fill the trench with mini marshmallows and mini chocolate chips.
Wrap in foil and place on campfire coals, on a grill, or a baking sheet in a 300ºF (150ºC) oven.
Cook for 5–15 minutes, checking frequently. The longer you wait, the more brown and caramelized the banana will get.

, If you thought normal marshmallows were decadent in cocoa, you may need to sit down for the toasted variety. These also work great on ice cream or milkshakes, especially vanilla or chocolate.

, Before you head for the arena , familiarise yourself with your new surroundings. Survey the scene around your tent for objects that mark out its location and memorise them. Walk from your tent to the nearest path and count how many steps you take, and the point where you join the walkway. Make a mental note of distinctive landmarks you pass en route from your tent, and any obstacles you encounter, such as gazebos, windbreaks or inconvenient guy ropes – they're even more likely to catch you out in the dark.

, Unless you're blessed with night vision, or a fondness for guy-rope related injuries, take a small torch with you any time you leave your tent in the evening. Many can be strung around your neck for convenience, or use a lanyard or a makeshift string necklace.

, Some people graffiti their tent to mark it out from those around.


But if you don't want to mark your tent permanently, buy some brightly-coloured or reflective tape. Stick a big cross on each side of your tent and you'll spot it from any direction, plus your torchlight (flashlight illumination) will catch it in the dark.
You can also mark guy ropes with tape so you don't trip. Don't go overboard, though – making your tent totally over-the-top means festival thieves can also find you in the dark.

, To guide you at night, raise your very own festival flag on a pole; anything goes as long as it's distinctive. Better yet, paint one with glow-in-the-dark paint.

, Still lost? Make sure you don't miss your tent by dangling empty beer cans close together on some of your guy ropes. Use strips of the ""camper's-best-friend"" bin liner to tie them on. Audio clues work wonders when you can't see: the cans will rattle together if you accidentally stumble upon your own tent without realising.

, Finally, if the worst happens, and you climb into bed with a stranger, be prepared to either make a new friend very quickly, or escape before they wake up! You can also use Glow Sticks to identify your tent

Prepare food as you would normally.,
Bring to a boil on stove, campfire, or in a solar oven.

,
Quickly place the boiling food into the suitcase, on top of sturdy clothing made solely from natural fibers like cotton.

,
As quickly as possible, cover with insulating clothing such as wool, fleece, or as shown here, a down vest.,
Close (zip or latch) the suitcase.,
Remove and enjoy your perfectly cooked food.",How to Use a Suitcase As a Haybox," In this case, 1 part brown rice to two parts water.;
,,, Pack the clothing in well to keep as much heat as possible inside the cooking vessel.

, Leave the food at least as long as you would if it were left simmering on the stove, but generally more time is better; you can leave things for hours without problems.

, Rice, in particular, is very well suited to this method; the days of boiled-over or burned-on rice are finally over.

Unpack the stove.,
Find somewhere firm and flat to place the windshield.,
Assemble the burner.,
Replace the lid immediately.,
Light a match and hold it into the burner.,
Add the pan.,
Cook.,
Adjust the flame while cooking.,
Finish cooking.",How to Use a Trangia Camping Stove," The stove is packaged to take up as little space as possible. As you take it apart, remember how each piece fits together so you can put it back together after use;
, Stoves should never be used in your tents, as the fabric that the tents are made from is very flammable. The Trangia comes with a two-piece windshield to keep the flame from going out if it's windy Place the bottom part of the windshield on the flat surface/ground.

, Remove the lid off the brass burner unit and pour in some methylated spirits (denatured alcohol) Never more than 3/4 full!

, Put the burner carefully in the centre of the windshield and put the second windshield in place.

, You won't see flames, but you'll feel heat when the spirit begins burning.

, Use the handle to place the pan on the metal supports inside the windshield.

, You can now use the stove to boil water, or heat food in the pan or frying pan.

, Use the adjustable burner top to control the flame. Always use the handle attachment when putting this in place.

, Put the closed burner top in place to turn off the stove. The lack of oxygen will cause the methylated spirits to stop burning after just a few seconds. Do not use the burner lid to extinguish the stove, the rubber seal inside the lid is not fireproof and will burn and melt all over your burner. Remove the burner top to make sure the fire has extinguished. Leave the Trangia to cool before packing it away.

Remove any loose dirt.,
Hose it down with clear water.,
Wash the tent in the tub.,
Rinse it off.,
Dry the tent.,
Use water repellent.",How to Clean a Dirty Tent," This includes any pine needles, leaves, Cones, equipment, etc. Make sure the tent is emptied out before doing any cleaning.;
, Rub with a damp cloth or a soft brush you would use to wash a car.

, If the tent is small enough, you can always wash it off in the tub. NEVER use laundry detergent, use Nikwax Tech or a non-detergent product sold at camping stores.

, Make sure you rinse it off thoroughly because the tent sometimes collect soapy water which are difficult to get rid of.

, Put the tent in your backyard or basement and let it dry. The tent may take a while to dry.

, Use it on the coated fabric floor and lower side walls of the tent and the rain fly. This must be applied while the tent is wet.

Create a classic fort-tent.,
Use fabric and a string.,
Make a tent out of your table.",How to Create an Indoor Tent1," This tent is definitely one you'll need to take down at the end of the day or in a day or two. Drag pieces of furniture together. Throw fabric over the top, such as a large sheet, and weigh down the sheet on the outside with pillows.


If you place chairs facing outward, throw the sheet over the tops, and let it hang down to the seats on the outside. Then, place pillows or books on top of the sheet where it rests on the seat of the chairs.
For a bigger tent, use binder clips to attach one sheet to another.;
, For a simple tent, tighten a string between two sturdy points. Throw a sheet over it in an a-frame shape to create a simple, quick setup tent. Add some pillows below, and you're good to go.For another option, run a dowel under the fabric, then use strings on the end to attach it to the ceiling.

, Find a tablecloth that runs all the way to the floor. Throw it over the table to create the tent. To get into the tent, just duck under an edge. If you want a more permanent door, pin or clip an edge up.Create your own tent-tablecloth by cutting a piece of fabric slightly bigger than your tabletop. Sew or glue a skirt on that goes all the way around the table, leaving a slit on one side. Hem the fabric to make it last longer, or use a fabric that doesn't fray, such as fleece.

"
"
Make an a-frame tent.,
Use PVC pipe.,
Create a teepee.",How to Create an Indoor Tent2," Measure half a foot down on each of 4 pieces of 1-inch by 2-inch by 48-inch whitewood molding or other similar wood. Drill a 3/4 of an inch hole where you've marked on the wood. Insert the wooden dowel through all the holes.You should have two pieces of wood near each end of the dowel. On each end, spread the two pieces in opposite directions to create the ""A"" frame.
Sew elastic loops on the corners of a twin sheet. Throw the sheet over the frame, and loop the elastic over the end of each piece of wood to hold it in place.

, PVC pipe is lightweight and cheap. You just need to buy pipe and connectors to make a large cube (or an a-frame or house shape) in the size you want. Cut the pipe smaller if you need to. To finish, throw a sheet over the tent.To help the sheet stay in place, create sleeves for your sheet, and thread them through two of the bottom edges.
The best part of this type of tent is you can take it apart. It's lightweight and travels easily.

, Buy six dowel rods in your preferred height. Drill holes in them about half a foot from the top. Thread a string through all of them, then gather them together. Spread them out into a teepee shape, and wrap the rope around them to stabilize the shape at the top.To make the fabric, measure how far apart you've spread your teepee. Measure at the bottom of one of the triangles, then measure up each side to where you want the fabric to reach. Cut triangles in fabric that are the same size, with an extra inch on each side for hemming.
Make a triangle for each of the five sides. Sew the triangles together, and hem the bottom. Sew a tie across the top for tying it together in the front. It also helps to sew ties to the inside at the seams, which allows you to tie the fabric to the poles. Pull the fabric over the frame, and tie it in place.

Make a canopy tent with a plastic embroidery hoop.,
Make a canopy tent with PEX pipe and a curtain.,
Use a convenient nook to make a permanent tent.",How to Create an Indoor Tent3," Start with a small plastic embroidering hoop. Get rid of the inner part, and unscrew the outer part. Thread on two curtain panels, each 44-inches. They should be facing outward.To hang it, tie (1/2-inch) ribbon or yarn on each side of the hoop, where the curtains meet. Tie them in a knot or bow above the embroidery hoop. Hang it on a screw hook in the ceiling.

, PEX pipe is flexible plastic pipe; find it at hardware stores. You'll need 1/2 inch tubing and a 1 1/2-inch coupling to connect it. You'll also need a long curtain panel.Cut off about 14 inches from the bottom of the curtain. If the bottom doesn't have a sleeve, sew or use fabric glue to create one. Sew or use fabric glue to attach the fabric to the top of the curtain (the unhemmed side), leaving the sleeve on the top of the curtain open.
Thread the pipe into the original curtain's sleeve. Attach it with the coupling. Thread a string through the sleeve you created. Gather up the fabric, and tie the string in a knot or bow. Attach it to the ceiling with a hook.

, If you have a small nook in your home, use a tension rod (the width of the nook) to make a tent. You'll also need a flat wood shim slightly smaller than the nook, as well as some screws and a drill.Get a piece of fabric wide enough for the nook, and long enough to go from front to back and to the floor. Decide where your shim on the wall is going to go. It should be higher than the tension rod in the front, which will be the height of your tent.
Cut the fabric in two, so that one piece is long enough to go from the shim to the tension rod, with extra inches on each side. The other piece should be long enough to reach the floor from the tension rod, with extra inches on either side.
Glue or hem three sides of the top piece of fabric, but leave the top unhemmed. On the bottom edge, make three loops on the underside of the fabric, spread out along the fabric. Glue the top edge to the shim, and screw it into studs in the wall with the fabric edge towards the wall. On the bottom piece of fabric, hem three sides (bottom and both sides). Make a sleeve with the top edge. Push the tension rod through one loop of the fabric, then push in the sleeve of the other fabric. Pull the last two loops on, and hang up the tension rod.

Choose your tent size.,
Choose your tent's shape.,
Choose tent poles.,
Choose a good fabric.,
Test the zippers.,
Seams are often reinforced with nylon tape; however some designs do not require this.,
Consider potential weather.,
Keep cost in mind.",How to Choose a Tent,"
Determine how many people and how much gear you'll be traveling with and what kind of use you need the tent for. Tents are advertised as two-person, four-person, six-person and so on. This is the maximum number of people that can sleep in closely with no room for personal gear. This rating method makes sense for backpackers who are traveling light, but is terrible for all others. Divide the advertised rating by two, and you will have a more realistic tent capacity. Therefore, most four man tents are only comfortable for two adults, or perhaps two adults and two small children and a pet.



 


Plan for a minimum of 25 square feet of floor space per person. Make this even higher for longer camping trips, unless reduced weight is important.






Consider actual length and width. If you are six feet tall, you will need a space of at least seven feet to stretch out and not be crammed against the tent sides. You will need at least two and one half feet in width just for sleeping. This equals only 17.5 square feet. A ""two-person"" tent might be advertised which measures four by seven feet. An eight by eight foot tent is ideal for two adults. You will have enough space for cots or a double air mattress, plus space to stand up when changing clothes. Kids can fit comfortably in smaller tents. Once they are old enough, they will probably want to sleep in a separate tent anyway. Parents will appreciate the privacy provided by this arrangement too. A four by seven foot tent is adequate for children. Teenagers should be considered as adults when fitting a tent.






Add space for clothing, and a space to sit up without crawling over your tent-mate, which will result in a more livable situation. Think more like eight by eight feet as a basic two man family camping tent. This gives you 32 square feet per person.






Be cautious about tents that are larger than 8'x8'. Large family tents are bulky and heavy, so they should not be considered for backpacking, bicycling or motorcycling. Family tents often have removable fabric walls inside to form rooms for privacy. They also have generous space for camp furniture such as cots and chairs. Their main advantage is generous space and sizable windows and doors, which provide great ventilation. Some even come with smaller pet doors and small porches (vestibules). However, large family tents are more difficult to find a big enough spot to set up. Big tents can also be heavy and hard to carry to your campsite, so they should only be considered for car camping. Third, bigger tents are harder to heat and keep warm on cold days because of their interior volume. Fourth, bigger tents can be less stable in high winds unless guy lines are used. Fifth, large tents are more difficult and time-consuming to set up. Occasionally, pitching a large tent can be a two-person operation. Consider bringing several smaller ones instead for large groups.






Consider peak inside height. For car camping and most trips where carrying the tent is not a consideration, try to have a tent that is tall enough for you to stand up in. Plan for the taller person in your group. A six or seven foot peak height is helpful for adults, and a four-foot peak is about right for kids. Remember, the tent walls slope downward at a sharp angle, so the actual spot where you can stand up will be small. Larger spaces will be provided in tents with taller peaks. For most backpacking tents, a height of 40 inches (101.6 cm) or more is provided so the occupants can sit up instead of standing up. Some small one-man tents are only slightly bigger than a sleeping bag and sitting up is not an option. Pick the size which best fits your needs and intended purpose. Generally pick the smallest, lightest tent you can live with if you're backpacking or biking. If you are uncomfortable in small spaces, opt for the larger size.





;
,

Tents come in four basic shapes: A-frame, umbrella, geodesic or ""dome"", and wall. The A-frame is the common ""pup"" tent shape, but can also be quite large. The umbrella is a commonly used family camping tent, as it has lots of standing room, with large windows and a rain fly over the top. The geodesic comes on many shapes, but all look like a combination of connected triangles. The wall tent is like an A-frame tent, but is generally much larger and has vertical sidewalls.






Tents with square floor shapes are more efficient when laying out sleeping and gear arrangements. Because of other factors, it is not always possible to have a square floor. If you buy a round floor, or nearly round like with the geodesic dome tents, you should allow some extra floor area to make up for the less efficient layout. Dome tents often have hexagonal floors and the triangular corners are usually used for gear storage.






Doors and windows are important considerations. For hot or humid conditions, choose a tent with generous screened window areas. Make sure your tent has a way to close these windows with a Velcro flap, zippered panel, or drawstring closure. Cheaper tents will not have these options. A tent for two or more people should have two doors on opposite sides so a person can exit the tent without climbing over another person.







,

Most tents come with either aluminum or fiberglass poles and most are linked with an elastic shock cord. This helps prevent lost poles and makes the setup faster and easier. Poles can bend or break, so many tent manufacturers provide emergency repair links for you to carry along on the trip.






Some poles on more complex tents have pivoted joints or bent sections. It's critical that you understand how to properly set up your tent without applying excess force to the poles to prevent damaging these pivoted joints.






Always set up your tent first at home as a test before using it in the field. It's far better to set it up in good conditions first than try to pitch it on a cold, dark, wet night for the first time.






Usually the maximum pole length will determine the maximum packed length of your tent. Consider this if you will be packing the tent on a bicycle, motorcycle or in a backpack. It is possible to re-section tent poles into smaller lengths so they will pack easier. A professional camping outlet can explain how this it done and sell you the necessary parts or do the work for you.
Some tents have inflatable tubes which serve as tent poles. This makes set up and compact packing very simple and easy.
Tent poles are attached to the tent in one of three ways: With enclosed channels, clips or hooks or from inside the tent itself. Some good alpine climbing tents will have poles that can be set up from inside the tent, so severe weather is not a consideration. Enclosed channels, which the poles are threaded through, are used on many 4-season tents with full-length flies to minimize air movement between the tents, fly, and provide a smoother, more leak resistant profile. Most modern tents use plastic clips to attach the tent to the poles. This makes the setup and teardown quick, simple, and easy.



, Nearly all tents are now made of nylon. Breathable nylon is normally used for tent walls. Coated nylon is used for the fly and floor for waterproofing. No-see-um mesh is used for the window screens. Heavier tents use thicker fabric and rip-stop fabric. Keep in mind that tent weight will increase if you choose thicker and denser fabrics. This may be unacceptable if you have to carry your tent on your bike or back. Remember to pack your tent when dry, if possible. If you must pack a wet tent, open it and dry it as soon as you get home, using Lysol, or other disinfectant spray to prevent mildew.

, They should open and close freely, and should not catch and bind up on the tent fabric. Zippers should not snag on nylon flaps or frayed fabric. Plastic or brass zippers will not corrode. Steel or aluminum zippers may corrode when wet but are stronger. You can lightly lubricate zipper mechanisms with clear spray silicone to keep them in good working order. When setting a tent up always remember to stake the tent out with the zippers closed so the openings will not be tight and difficult to close later.

, The tape is stitched into each seam, and will make the seam stronger and more weatherproof. Waterproof seams in a nylon tent, such as on the fly and floor are waterproofed with a seam sealer or heat sealing process. Your new tent may come with a bottle of seam sealer. Set up the tent in the yard before your trip, and apply the sealer. Let it dry before packing the tent. You should make sure the seams are properly sealed before each trip., Wind, rain, sun, heat and cold all have different demands on the tent.


Windy areas require sturdy poles, stakes, and guy lines. Geodesic tents are excellent in wind. Their igloo-like shape reduces the wind resistance and their pole arrangement provides great strength. If your tent comes with a vestibule, be sure to set the tent up so it faces away from the wind.






Rain creates three considerations. First, keeping the rain out. Second, giving you enough room so you will be comfortable if you have to ""weather"" the storm by entertaining yourself indoors for a while. Third, providing enough ventilation with the increased humidity to keep everything dry inside the tent.






Most tents have a waterproof rain fly made of coated nylon or other material. Some high performance backpacking tents use waterproof and breathable wall fabrics so they don't require a fly. The fly should cover the breathable portions of the tent. Some tent flies will only cover a few inches of the top. Others will extend all the way to the ground. The intended tent use dictates this. The fly should keep out all types of rain, even if it is windy. The fly should extend far enough over the door, so it keeps out the rain when you open the door to enter or leave.
The floor should also be waterproof coated nylon. This fabric should cover the floor, and turn up the sides for about six inches or so. There should be as few seams as possible. This is called a ""tub"" floor. It will keep out any water that runs down and under the tent.
Be sure to buy a footprint (groundcloth) to go with your tent. This will not only protect the floor from rocks and debris, but can prevent ground condensation inside the tent if you pitch your tent on a cold, damp site. Many tents are available with a matching footprint that can be snapped or clipped to the bottom of the tent.


Sun and heat create the need for shade and airflow. The rain fly will provide shade for the tent. Large screened windows on opposite sides of the tent, or a screened window opposite a screened door, will allow air to flow through the tent to prevent condensation.






Cold weather brings special needs. Unless you will be dealing with snow (when you would need a mountaineering tent), you can use a ""three-season"" tent that has good features. The most important features will be a rain fly that covers the top and sides, and an interior layer made from an open mesh fabric to allow water vapor to pass through it. In cool weather, warm water vapor inside the tent, from damp fresh air and moist air you exhale, will condense on the cooler surface of the tent's exterior. The only way to prevent this is to allow the excess water vapor to escape from the tent by passing through the mesh fabric.

The tent size may also be a consideration if you plan to camp in cool weather. Your body heat will keep a small tent much warmer than outside. However, some campers will use a tent heater in their large tent. Heaters are not always safe in small tents due the closeness of the tent walls. If you use a catalytic heater, remember that these consume oxygen and require adequate ventilation. If you do use a heater, remember to open any tent windows or vents to allow air to circulate. In smaller tents in cold climates, consider using a sleeping bag with a colder temperature rating or a safely suspended enclosed candle lantern instead.



,


In general, the higher priced tents are made with stronger fabric, stronger poles, have stronger stitching and more features. They will withstand higher winds and heavier rain. They will last longer. If well cared for, a good tent can last for many years. However, not everyone needs this strength and durability. In milder and drier climates and close to home (""just in case"") the least expensive tents are good bargains.






If you are just beginning your family camping adventures and don't know if you will like camping, then you might want to choose lower cost tents. It is very likely that you will plan your first trips for warm, dry weather and will probably remain close to ""civilization"" until you gain some experience. You can always upgrade to a better tent later, and keep your original budget tent for when conditions allow.
Try to borrow a tent or purchase one used if it is your first time camping.
Learn from your experiences with your first tent for when you upgrade to a better one.

If you have an idea of the place you want to go, look for an established camp site on a map. Ask friends or family who go camping for any suggestions. Find out about the rules and regulations of the camp-site; Are large groups of people camping together allowed? Is the camp-site just for caravans or can you take a tent there too? How large can your tent be? Are pets allowed? Find out about the facilities. You will want a camp site with good toilet and shower facilities and water supplies. Do you want a site with entertainment, such as bars? Do you want a shop on the site, or a cafe? Or a swimming pool? Or do you want a more basic camp site with nice scenery? Find the perfect site for you. No matter where you camp you will need to find a place that has even ground to pitch your tent on, but not completely flat in case of rain. Make sure there is available room and book a space.;
, If you're just trying out camping, a used tent is great for your first trips. Try to find one with a built in sheet underneath to prevent cold and insects from getting inside. Buy another ground sheet to put underneath the tent to protect it. A good tent should have at least one window, and enough space for all people who are going. You should have enough room for everyone to sleep, and more room for storage. Decide if you want a tent with one main door or several. Try to face the doors away from the wind when you pitch your tent, and make sure the doors zip fully closed. Make sure you have some good quality pegs to pitch your tent with and a tool such as a hammer or mallet to put them in with. You should know how to pitch your tent before you leave for the camp site, so practice in your back garden. In case of bad weather, you should try to find a tent with a porch or an awning.

, Whether you are sleeping on camp beds, air beds, in a sleeping bag on the floor or on a camping mat, make sure you have them. When you are practicing putting up your tent, you could try fitting in all beds to see if you have enough space. If you are sleeping on air beds, make sure you take a pump to inflate them and a repair kit in case they get damaged. Remember to bring anything else such as sleeping bags, extra sheets/blankets or pillows.

, Buy a good camping stove. If you have a gas stove, make sure you have a gas canister to power it. Remember to bring all your cooking equipment, such as lightweight pots and pans, something to eat off, utensils and of course, food. You can get water from camp sites as nearly all have water supplies. If you want to make hot drinks such as tea or boil water, buy a small kettle to put on the stove. Sort out where you are going to eat. Buy fold up chairs and tables and decide whether you are going to put them inside or outside. Put your stove outside the tent, as tent material is highly flammable and it could cause a fire. Buy some wind breaks to shelter the stove in case you can't light it in the wind. If your camp site does not have a pot washing facility, take a bowl to wash your pots in straight after you have finished your meal so that animals and insects are not attracted to dirty dishes around your tent. Remember to take some washing up liquid and something to clean dishes with, along with tea towels. Remember other essentials such as can openers, bottle openers, napkins or tissues, a tablecloth for your table and anything else you might need.

, Take some boxes for storage, for things such as food. Take some plastic bags to fasten opened food bags in. Take a first aid kit with things such as plasters and bandages. Bring items to help your camping trip to be more comfortable, such as sun cream, toilet paper, baby wipes to freshen up and insect repellent. Bring a toiletries bag which includes things like soap, shampoo, toothpaste, toothbrushes, towels, wash cloths and any other cosmetics or toiletries you want to take. Bring a backpack in case you go walking or exploring and need to carry a lot of things. Bottles of water or empty bottles to fill up would be perfect for this reason too. Other things could include cameras, books, paper and pens, alarm clocks, tape and string/rope just in case you need it. Waterproof material/cover is needed for your stove.

, Your camping trip will be miserable if you forget lighting. Imagine trying to find your way back to your tent in the dark without a torch. You especially need light if you have children camping with you. Bring some torches; larger ones for in the tent, and smaller, waterproof ones for going to the toilet block in the dark. Other lighting methods include lanterns or lamps that run on liquid fuel. Make sure you bring spare batteries or fuel for your lights.

, If you are camping in the summer, don’t forget clothes such as shorts, thin tops, swimsuits, slip flops or sandals. If it is colder, bring jumpers, coats, trousers or long sleeved tops with trainers or boots. Don’t forget enough underwear and thick socks if its cold. Bring something to sleep in such as long pajamas, as it gets cold at night. Even if you do go in the summer, bring a jumper, as it can get cold at night and if you are walking a long way to the toilet block, warm clothes can help. Your camping holiday will be ruined if you are too cold.

, You should have already practiced putting up your tent, and you should try to do it as soon as you get there, before it gets dark. If you are allocated a certain space, make sure you stay in this area and put your tent up in the right place. If not, find a place with clear, even ground but preferably with a slope. Choose a place without any over hanging branches or places where there are lots of insects.

, Make sure everything has a place. Sort out all the beds, and if your tent has separate rooms for sleeping, zip these up to prevent insects from getting in. Put your food into the storage boxes and make sure they are sealed so nothing can get inside. When you go into the tent, take your shoes off outside to help keep your tent clean, and if your tent has an insect net, zip this up after you. Make sure you know where the first aid kit is and where your torches are. Hammer in your wind breaks if you are using them. They can be very useful to shelter you and your tent, and you can hang towels round the posts to help them dry.

, Find the closest toilets and make sure they are clean. If the showers are not in the same area as the toilet block, locate them. Find the laundry/shop/entertainment if your site has these, and find out opening times or other information. Walk around and see the scenery of your camp site, and enjoy it.

, Set up your stove and wind breaks outside, making sure that your stove is on a stand. When you have finished cooking, wash your dirty pots in a bowl or put them in a bowl and take them to a pot washing area if your camp site has one of these. If it is bad weather, put your stove in the porch or awning of your tent, but keep all heat away from the actual material. Securely store food when you have used it; seal opened bags and make sure everything goes back into the storage boxes. Put waste food into rubbish bags and keep them sealed and off the ground. You could tie the rubbish bag around the post of your wind break to get it off the ground.

, Make sure you cover up your stove with the waterproof cover. Fold up your chairs and table and bring them into the tent at night. bring in any personal belongings and things like footballs or sports equipment, or put them in the boot of your car for the next morning. If you are worried about your belongings, lock anything valuable in your car in a hidden place such as your glove compartment. Or you could keep it next to your sleeping area. Make a last trip to the toilet block to brush your teeth, and don’t forget a torch or two to find your way back. Decide whether you are having a shower or not, and if you aren’t, decide whether to get changed at the toilet block or in your tent. If your tent has separate rooms or partitions, you can get changed at the tent. You could use a plastic bag for dirty clothes or put them into an empty suitcase if you are waiting till you get home to wash them, or store them somewhere to wash/take to the laundry the next day. Zip the tent up securely, and put on a torch or light in the tent so you can see what you are doing. Make sure everyone is inside and in their sleeping bags.

, Some camp sites have leaflets in shops or cafes about local things to see, but if not, ask someone who works there or drive around the area. If the camp ground has bikes available, consider renting one on the first day to explore the area, and ask for a map. Take a walk around the local town/village and go shopping or see some scenery. Take a walk in the evening and listen to the sounds of the animals around you.

, Don’t spend your camping holiday just sat in your tent. Camping is about being outside and enjoying nature and everything around you. So get outside and breathe in the fresh air whilst doing something fun! If you have brought along your bikes, go for a bike ride. Go for a walk or a hike to see some of the scenery and get away from everything. Go wildlife spotting or fishing. There is lots to do where ever you go. If it rains or is bad weather, look for indoor activities such as a museum or a nature centre. At night, go outside and look at the stars for a while. Or you could make a campfire and sit around it at night. If you do make a campfire, make sure you do it safely and learn how to beforehand. Also, check if your camp site allows camp fires to be made and follow the rules if it doesn’t.

, If you are showering on the camp-site, check out the showers beforehand. Check if they are free or coin operated. Also, check if there is a hair-dryer in the shower block and if you have to pay to use it, or if you will have to leave your hair to dry naturally. Don’t forget to bring towels, shampoo and soap with you. Always wear old flip flops when going in the shower to protect your feet from germs. To make sure a shower is always available, do not use them at peak times. Whilst everyone will use them in the morning or evening, use them very early in the morning, in the late afternoon or late at night. Don’t be too fussy about your looks when camping. Leave curling irons, straighteners, excessive make up and lotions at home.

, The camping experience is for everybody, so don’t ruin it for anyone else. This means keeping pets under control if you bring them along and cleaning up their mess, keeping music at a sensible volume and turning it off when it starts to get late, clearing up your litter and waste, leaving bathroom and shower facilities clean and following any speed limits on your site. Above all, respect the camp sites rules and it will be a better trip for everyone.

Sleep on a sleeping mat.,
Sleep in a bivouac sack.,
Sleep on a tarpaulin or other strong sheet.,
Build a swamp bed.,
Sleep on sand.,
String up a hammock.",How to Camp Without a Tent1," A simple roll-out mat may be enough on a warm night, straight under the stars. A comfortable sleeping mat that self-inflates and a sleeping bag or suitable cover should suffice for a good night's rest when the conditions are right. Of course, the area needs to be safe from predatory animals, biting insects and human intruders, so choose the place wisely.


If the ground is soft and clean enough, you might get away with sleeping in just a sleeping bag. However, this will rarely feel warm enough for the whole night.






On really hot nights, use a lightweight cover over you, in place of a sleeping bag.





;
, These can be purchased from camping and sports stores. They are like a sleeping bag with a little extra space. You can also build bivouac shelters, based on the same shape and principle of being very snug, preventing the escape of too much warm air.

, This will place a barrier between you and the ground. Use a sleeping bag or blanket to cover you; add a mat for extra comfort. In the morning, hang the tarpaulin up to dry (the underside will often be moist).

, This type of ""bed"" is made from ferns, moss, branches, straw, etc. Use whatever is available where you are and try to keep it snug. If you're over a moist or damp area, keep it up off the ground.


A bed of pine needles, grasses, or other soft vegetation can be quite comfortable with a sleeping bag or blanket on top.







, Sand is soft and if you burrow in can help insulate you but don't sleep too close to shore in case you've misjudged the tide.

, There are different kinds of hammocks and swinging bed structures available. In some places, such as the jungle, this is really the safest way to sleep, away from the water, bugs and prowling creatures. You can either carry a commercially made hammock suited for the purpose or learn to rig up a simple one using ropes and a tarpaulin or simple strong sheet.

"
Use a tarpaulin.,
Build a small shelter.,
Build a snow cave.",How to Camp Without a Tent2," A tarpaulin can serve as a very rudimentary shelter that may suffice for the night. It can keep mild rain off and can even block wind if angled correctly.

, Shelters can vary in complexity, from the very simple from branch, leaves, ferns, type to a completely structured and daubed shelter suitable for several nights. Some shelters to try include:

Sleep in a cabin or on the porch of a cottage or seaside holiday house, shack (Australia) or bach (NZ).,
Sleep in a back country cabin or hut.,
Sleep in a yurt.,
Sleep in your vehicle.",How to Camp Without a Tent3," Although not true camping, you're still roughing it to some extent and you get the benefit of a stronger shelter, which can be handy if the weather is bad.

, It really depends on how you define ""camping"" - some of these buildings are so rudimentary that there is very little difference between these and tent stays. Be sure to take the appropriate supplies, such as sleeping bag, etc.

, This is like a ""permanent"" tent and many resourceful accommodations companies will provide these for outdoor stays. The yurt will allow you to feel comfortable but still ""in the wilds"".

, From the back of your car to a recreational vehicle, caravan (travel trailer/mobile home), refitted buses, etc., taking a vehicle into the wilds can serve as both transportation and accommodation.

"
"
Build a fire.,
Wear warm clothes in cooler weather.",How to Camp Without a Tent4," For all cases except for the snow cave, build a fire if this is permissible. This is especially important if you are camping in a desert environment where night temperatures can drop dramatically below the heat of the day.


Sleep close to the fire. If you're really cold, you'll find yourself waking up and tending to the fire to re-stoke it, so leave a bundle of fuel near it to throw on in case this happens. If you don't wake up, it's still handy to have to stoke up for breakfast.







, This will help to counteract the inevitable heat loss from sleeping outdoors. Even with a tent, warm clothes are essential.

Before getting your poles you will need to measure the length of your tipi (top to bottom);
,
Now that you've established the length of your tipi, your poles should be at least 4 feet (1.2 m) longer than than your tipi.,
Your poles can be made from young spruce tree's and should be fully limbed.,
Take the 3 largest poles from the 12 (these 3 will be the support for the other poles).

,
You will need a rope 25–30 feet (7.6–9.1 m) long and it can't be too thick nor too thin so that it may break.

,
Lay these poles together and tie them tightly together with one end of the rope, about 2 feet (0.6 m) longer on the poles than your tipi.,
Now you will need your helpers.,
Spread the bottom of the tripod out at least 8 feet (2.4 m) across from each pole.,
One person should take the rope and stand on the outside of the tripod while the other person gets the first pole.

,
The first pole should be placed about 3 feet (0.9 m) beside one of the tripod poles (this will be your door).

,
DO NOT place your pole in among the poles at the top.,
While you hold the pole in place, have your helper with the rope, walk around the outside of the frame with the rope making one full circle and then pulling the rope tight.

,
Continue this with each pole in a clock wise rotation.,
You can tie the left over rope at the bottom of one pole.

,
Now place the cover over the tipi frame.,
You can now move the poles out to tighten up your tipi.

,
All that's left is to peg down the bottom of your tipi.

,
Your tipi may come with flaps at the top.",How to Build an Aboriginal Plains Style Tipi,", Example, if your tipi is 12 feet (3.7 m) long then your poles should be 16 feet (4.9 m) long.

, Any limbs will poke a hole in your tipi canvas.

,,, Make sure your poles are even before you tie them.

, Fan the poles out at the bottom at least 3 feet (0.9 m) apart. Now you and your helpers raise the poles up to form a tripod.

, Your rope should be hanging down in the center of the tripod.

,,, You must lean the pole on the outside left of the tripod.

,, 3 poles go in between each tripod pole.

,, You will need to ""do up the front"" of your tipi with small sticks, ( you will need to figure out how large).

,,, If it does, you will need an additional 2 poles. These 2 poles must be another 4 feet (1.2 m) longer than your tipi frame poles.

Find a decently flat area with a tree that splits it's trunk fairly low; forming a ""V"" shape no further than 6' or 8' feet off the ground.,
Find a long tree limb; the straighter, the better.,
Place one end of the limb you found in the previous step in ""V"" of your chosen tree.,
Find some thinner (2"" or 3"") sticks and limbs/branches for ""the ribs"" that can be leaned on the large pole (the spine) at about 45-50 degrees, and (of course) touch the ground.,
Find smaller sticks that are less than or equal to about an inch in diameter.,
You should now have a decent skeleton of a shelter; but it isn't suitable for sleeping in just yet.,
Add all of this to the frame of the shelter in order of decreasing size until you can't find any holes you can fit fist though.,
Gather extra dead leaves, pine boughs or whatever other soft/yielding materials you may have left over, and spread them over the floor of your shelter if you do not have a ground pad with you.,
Test your complete lean-to shelter's stability by gingerly applying gradual weight/pressure to various places of the spine.,
If you found any weak-spots, you may want to reinforce those with a couple well-placed ""ribs"" that are in a ""Y"" shape, basically forming support columns.,
Admire a job well done!,
When you have your shelter and a hot, controlled fire, you may try to stand a large, flat stone (or similar object) up on the side of the fire ring to reflect heat to your shelter.

,
Cover your gear with a pack cover or trash bag, (if you have gear in a pack) and check-in to the ""I'm warm and definitely not dead"" motel!",How to Build a Survival Shelter," Note that you will probably make some compromises here due to time constraints. Or, if you are in a coniferous area with trees that don't typically split their trunks, you will have to stick a sturdy ""Y"" shaped limb/branch into the ground to simulate a tree with a split trunk.;
, It should be a few feet longer than you, and from 3"" to 6"" thick. Rough bark is a plus, as it will help to avoid slipping. This is going to be the spine of your shelter, which the rest of the frame (which you can think of as the ribs) will lean against.

, The other end should rest sturdily on the ground, or if possible, be stuck/buried in the ground a few inches.

, start leaning them against the ""spine"" to create the basic frame of your shelter. Once again, it helps if you can push a few of the larger sticks into the ground to add to the stability of the frame.

, Lean these up against the ""spine"" to fill in the space between the thicker ""ribs"".

, You need some insulation, or ""skin"" to keep your body heat in, and the wind/weather out. Gather green pine boughs if they are available. (Don't kill off the trees by taking all of their branches though.) Find other things such as thin twigs, leaves, brush, or even mud. Use these types of materials in whatever combination is available to you.

, You can add to this layer as much as resources and time will allow. This will increase heat retention and weather resistance.

, (You always should if you are just practicing.)This will help stop the cold ground from sucking all of your precious body heat away.

, Do this very carefully! You want to check the structure's safety, by finding a spot where it feels like it might start to give way; but you don't want to actually put enough pressure that it does.

, (Probably from the inside.) If you cannot find any nice, ""Y""-shaped sticks, you will probably have to re-distribute the weight of the ""skin"" to alleviate the uneven weight on the frame.

, At this point, you will probably want to build a fire if you didn't have time already. Be sure to make a fire ring by placing rocks in a circle, and removing as much snow as you can (assuming there is snow on the ground) from the center of the circle.

Run through a short checklist of questions to determine what kind of tent you need:


Will you be camping during summer only (in which case a 3-season tent is sufficient) or will you be camping during winter, in which case you need a 4-season or expedition tent?,
Set a maximum budget for yourself and stick to it.,
Practice setting the tent up before you buy it--most stores will allow you to do this, or at least have a sample tent set up so you can see what it looks like fully erect.,
Bring the backpack you intend to carry your camping tent in to the store with you.,
Make a short list of tents that suit your priorities and budget to help guide your camping tent purchase.",How to Buy a Camping Tent," If you intend to go mountaineering--winter camping under extreme conditions--go straight to the expedition tents.
How many people will be sharing the tent? Tents are rated in terms of ""people capacity"": 2-person, 3-person and so on. But the tent ratings usually assume a snug fit, so if you need more personal space, size up by ""person.""
Which is more important: tent capacity, price, or weight? In general, you can find a tent that excels with at least 1 or 2 of these factors, but not all 3 at once.
If reducing size and weight are your highest priorities, consider single-walled tents.
Does the tent need to be freestanding? In other words, are you willing to stake it down every time you set it up (non-freestanding) or must it be able to stand on its own, stake-free (freestanding)? This is usually only a consideration for 1- or 2-person tents; the larger tent designs are almost always freestanding, although you still need to stake freestanding tents down in high winds and other wet weather.;
, There's no point in even considering something you can't afford to buy, although you can sometimes find excellent cut-rate deals from retailers like sierratradingpost.com, rei.com/outlet and campmor.com.


If you need a high-quality tent on a limited budget, check online and print classified listings for used tents.

, Ask yourself the following questions:


Could I set this tent up in the dark, rain, wind and/or snow?
How long does it take me to set the tent up? (5 minutes or less is ideal, once you've got the hang of it.)

, Pack the tent down and check to see how well it fits in your backpack.


Remember, you also need enough room to carry a sleeping bag, sleeping pad and camp stove in the same pack.
If you're buying a tent for several people to share, you can divide the parts of the tent (body, rain fly, poles) between several peoples' packs.

,


A good camping tent will last for years; a bad camping tent will also last for years, and annoy you the entire time. So although you should stay within your budget, remember that you usually get what you pay for.

Do not roll a bag if it comes with a stuff sack and space is no issues.,
Lay the sleeping bag on a flat, dry surface.,
Zip up the bag and push any large air pockets out through the head.,
Fold the sleeping bag in half lengthwise.,
Start rolling upwards, firmly, from the feet.,
Sit on the bag with your knees to keep it tight.,
Use the attached straps to keep the bag rolled.,
Keep the bag dry and free from water.",How to Roll a Sleeping Bag1," Rolling a bag frequently can damage the insulation, making it less effective at keeping you warm. Most bags that come with a storage bag are actually meant to be stuffed into the bag loosely, not rolled. Check your owner's manual if you are unsure how to store your bag.


If the bag came with straps, either separately or attached near the head, it is likely meant to be rolled. These straps are meant to keep the bag rolled up.
If you need to save space, rolling your bag is the best way to compress it into its smallest shape. However, you should try to remove your bag from compression as soon as possible.;
, If possible, use your ground tarp of the floor of your tent to roll up the bag, as this will keep it clean and moisture from getting rolled into the bag, where mildew might grow.

, Zip it up completely, as an unzipped bag makes it hard to roll evenly.Smooth out the bag so that you get out as much air as possible, as air pockets will prevent an even, tight roll.

, Fold one side over so that it lines up with the zipper. Take some time to make sure the edges are lined up. They don't have to be perfect, but the closer you can get them the better., Use both hands to roll the bag up tightly, kneading it with your hands to push any air in the bag up and out the hole at the top for your head., If you are having trouble getting the bag tight enough, crouch down and use your knees to keep the roll tight and push out air. Then roll up another 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm), using your fingers to get the roll tight, and push some more air out with your knees.

, Most sleeping bags that are meant to be rolled have straps that cinch around the rolled bag and then tighten, keeping it rolled up. You should have at lease two, and they should be positioned roughly 1/3 of the way from each edge of the rolled bag.If you don't have straps, you can improvise one out of a belt, large rubber bands, or rope.
If your bag came with a bag but no straps, store the sleeping bag in the appropriate carrying bag and close the top tightly.

, If you are in the backcountry a wet sleeping bag isn't only uncomfortable, it can be dangerous. Water wicks heat away from your skin much faster than air, so a wet bag can lead to deadly cold temperatures if you aren't careful. Keep your bag in a waterproof bag, or improvise one out of garbage bags if you don't have one."
"
Know that prolonged compression will make your bag less effective.,
Turn wind or water resistant bags inside out.,
Use a stuff-sack for tighter packing.,
Air out your bag when you return from your trip.,
Gently pull any leaking down feather back into the bag.",How to Roll a Sleeping Bag2," Keeping your bag tightly stuffed or rolled for long periods of time will make it lose loft, which is what traps hot air to keep you warm.While you want to roll your bag tightly to travel with, you should never store your bag compressed or jammed in a stuff-sack.


Loosely roll your bag, or let it rest, lightly folded, when it is not in use.

, The layering on the outside of these bags is great at keeping air out when you need to stay warm, but it can keep air in when you need it to escape for packing. Turn these bags inside out, zip them up, and then roll them as normal., These bags come with several straps and cinches that let you pull down on the top of the bag and get it even smaller. They are usually waterproof, and you can often get a large enough bag the lets you stuff several other items, like shirts or camping pillows, in with the bag.


Always start packing by the tail if you use a stuff sack -- this allows the air in the bag to escape through the top., While you should never stuff your bag and store it fully compressed, good bag care requires brushing out any dirt, twigs, and leaves and letting the bag dry out completely when your trip is over. Mold and mildew will grow if your bag is allowed to be stored wet, and it is tough to remove once it grows. Let the bag rest outside on a dry day for several hours and brush out any debris.


UV light can damage the sleeping bag fibers, so take care not to leave the bag in the sun all day., A few loose pieces of down is not uncommon in new sleeping bags. Gently work the quills back into the bag, pulling from the back side whenever possible. The holes will close back up and the insulation should settle with time."
"
Unpack your tent supplies.Once you've found a good area to set up camp, it's time to unpack your things.,
Lay down a ground cloth.No matter how much you clear the area, there may still be twigs and other debris that could puncture your tent or make the surface otherwise uncomfortable.,

Avoid setting up in low areas if there's a chance of rain.It's not recommended that you camp on a day where there's a likelihood of rain in the first place, but just in case, it's a good idea not to set your campsite in a depression in the ground.,
Find a flat space.Tents need a flat space to be set up properly.,
Clear the chosen area of debris.Once you've found a relatively flat area that's free of apparent hazards, you should prep the campsite by clearing out debris that could hurt the tent or make the surface uneven.,
Make sure the area is reasonably clear of wildlife.",How to Assemble a Tent," It's a good idea to pack all of the parts out at once. Assembling your tent will be fastest if you don't have to unpack each item one at a time. Keep all parts nestled in one place so you can keep account of everything. Because the list of supplies depends on the specific type of tent you're using, here are a few different types of tents you can consider:


A-Frame tents are the most typical and common type of tent for personal use. They're the easiest to erect and usually come with extras like a rain-fly and weather tarp.
Tunnel tents are different from typical ""A-Frame"" tents because they are structured by two long poles that both run the width of the tent. This creates a wider interior with more headspace. However, they're not nearly as stable when it comes to wind.Dome tents are generally the largest, and usually reserved for larger groups in camping. Although they're quite a bit bigger, they're generally very easy to pitch.;
, A ground cloth should be big enough to encompass the space of at least most of your tent. The added cushion of a ground cloth will lead to a more comfortable rest.

, Lie the tent frame out. That way, you can make sure you're sliding the poles through the right slots. This is arguably the most time-consuming part of tent assemblage, but it's very straightforward.


In the case of a ""tunnel tent"", make sure the poles are parallel from one another.

, If the support poles have joints, make them rigid. The poles are going to have a pre-set frame to them for the main body of the tent. Help the tent up by lifting parts of it. The poles should hold the frame in place. If not, secure loose parts of the poles or extend them as needed.

, This will stabilize the tent and make sure it doesn't move around. If you don't have tent pegs for whatever reason, you can improve by using sturdy sticks and pushing them into the soil.

, This is where the rain-fly comes in. A rain-fly is an additional piece you set overtop the tent. There should be something along the line of latches on the roof of your tent to secure the rain-fly in place. Even if you're pretty sure there will be no rain, it doesn't hurt to install it nonetheless. It will ensure all of your tent equipment stays in one place, and prepare you for unforeseen rain showers.

, Once the tent is set up, you can equip the interior. Because there isn't usually much space in a tent, you should decide which things are alright to store outside, and which things should be kept inside. Sleeping bags are an obvious must in your tent. Crates and hard-cased storage can be left outside.


If there's a risk of bears in the area you're camping, it is strongly recommended you keep food out of the tent. If a bear comes, you don't want him rummaging into your tent because he picked up the scent of granola.

, This makes the experience of camping nicer, but it also makes the cleanup process easier. Make an effort to keep shoes off while you're in the tent. Keep the space clutter-free and throw out excess wrappers appropriately.

, Taking pegs out is usually pretty easy, and should be the first thing you do before dismantling your tent. If you can't pull them up by hand, try digging out the soil around the peg to loosen it.


The rain-fly should be unlatched as soon as possible as well.

, Once the pegs are out, pull the bottoms of the tent poles out from the sockets in the fabric. Do this for all four corners before you move on and take out upper sockets. This will make sure the tent isn't imbalanced later on during the dismantling.


Take down the camp slowly. Even the best tents can be fragile if you're not careful.

, While you're putting pegs and poles aside, do your best to keep them all in one place. You should be storing them all in one place usually, but it's especially important if you're out camping. You don't want to drive away without first taking account of all the parts.

, Once the camp is dismantled, you should do a last-minute scan to make sure there isn't anything you accidentally left or forgot about. In most cases you'll be able to account for everything, but it definitely helps for the occasions you'll have missed something. While you're scanning, you should make sure you haven't left any garbage. You should make the campsite look as good or better than when you left it.

, Once you get back home, you should keep the tent parts in one place and somewhere dry. If the tent gathers mildew or moisture over time, this will rot out the fabric and ruin the tent for any future use.

, There are lots of different types and sizes of tent on the market. Some are only big enough to fit one or two people, while others are massive enough to include tables and chairs. If you're buying a tent for personal use, you should stick to smaller-sized tents. Bigger tents are harder to carry around, and usually take longer to put together and dismantle.


Tents will usually have a recommended persons limit on the box. Although the worth of these estimates is a bit iffy (you should usually round up the number, if anything) it can give you some insight as to the approximate size.
Don't cheap out and purchase the discount brands of tent. Although you'll save money, they wear out quickly and lack the protection of better tents. You'll be making this tent your home on more than one occasion after all, so it's worth to spend a bit more and go for at least a run-of-the-mill model

, Any new tent is going to take a bit of time to figure out how it goes together. With these two things in mind, it's a good idea to set the tent up in your back yard or living room before you even leave for your trip. You'll be able to work out the kinks in the assembly process without having to worry about time or having somewhere to sleep.


This is also recommended in the small possibility that the package did not come with all its parts. If there was a fault on the part of the manufacturer, you can send it back and get a replacement version.

, Among the more obvious things like food and clothing, its essential that you bring some kind of basic first-aid kit with you whenever you camp. Bandages, over-the-counter painkillers, gauze and topical cream are some of the things you should bring with you. Although serious injury is unlikely, minor scrapes and bruises are commonplace when you're outdoors, and you'll want to get to soothe them quickly so that they don't impact your experience.

, It's a preventable pain to realize you've forgotten something necessary at home. This is especially true if you get to your camping location and realize you left something essential for the tent behind. Even if you're in a rush out the door, take a few extra minutes to verify you have all your bases covered.


It's useful to write up a quick list of the things you and your party will need for a trip.

, When you get to a potential camping location, you should give a quick glance around to see if you spot anything dangerous. Chances are you will be camping in a natural woodland area. If this is true, it's a good idea to read up on your location a bit beforehand to see what kind of hazards other people have reported.


Broken trees above can be lethal if they fall on your tent in the tent. It's best to stay clear of anything that looks unstable.
Bee hives are hard to spot in a wild area. All the same, the sight of one is a good sign you should stay away.
The common sight of animal droppings is an indication that this is an area that gets a lot of animal traffic. Although many animals will steer clear of you, some predators (often bears) will make a target of campsites.

, If it rains, the rain will trickle down and risk flooding your campsite.

, This is the ground you'll be sleeping on, so it's necessary you find the flattest possible piece of ground within reason. Keep the size of your tent in mind, and accommodate for a space outside the tent gate. Having a hill drop right outside the door is a recipe for injury.

, Although broken glass can be legitimately dangerous to camp on, you won't be able to sleep if there are stones on the ground where you're trying to rest., If you're camping out in a relatively wild area, you should be prepared for the possibility of animals. Although most animals will stay clear from humans, bears are a major danger and can be lethal. Seeing a lot of animal droppings can be a sign that you're close to an animal's hunting ground. Although you'll never be able to know for sure, you can usually look up the camping region beforehand to see if other people have reported bear sightings.


If there is any risk, you should keep things like food out of your tent. That way, a bear won't need to rummage into your tent if he picks up the food's scent.

Learn how to sleep in a hammock.",How to Camp Comfortably With a Hammock," When most people think of hammocks, they think the fishnet kind or the rug with wood poles at the end. Those hammocks are bad. If you want real comfort don't go for them. Look for flexible, blanket-like hammocks that are made of cotton or spandex that can wrap around you with a foot extra. You want it longer than you are, and wider is better. They can be expensive, but they are very comfortable and worth the money.;
, They should come with a rope, but if they don't, you should buy some. There are strap kits available for trees so that you don't damage them by drilling in screws or having ropes strip the bark.


Figure out how high or low you want to be while laying in it. Then, because the hammock will stretch, put it up about two feet higher than you want.






Wrap the rope around the tree or attach it to the pole.






Bring the rope around the tree/pole to where the end is facing you.






Tie it in a sailor's knot, then come around the tree/pole again, and repeat the sailor's knot.







, Don't put your head at one end and feet at the other -- it's not comfortable and often hard on your back. Instead, stretch out at a diagonal or across the middle.

Cool beers with cold water.,
Give the beer a cold ""bath"".,
Add table salt to the ice.,
Run the faucet.,
Submerge the beers in a body of water.,
Stick your beers in the snow.",How to Cool Beers Without a Fridge1," This is one of the fastest ways to lower the temperature of a beverage, and you can do it indoors or outdoors. Completely submerge the surface of your beer container in cold water; the colder, the better. If the water is icy, you should be able to sufficiently cool a beer from room temperature to ""party cold"" within five minutes. The process might take somewhat longer if you're outdoors, or if the water is warmer.


If you're indoors: Dunk the beers in a bucket of ice water, or run them under a cold tap for a few minutes.
If you're outdoors: Submerge the beers in a natural water source – a river, a spring, a lake, or an ocean. Make sure to secure the beers so that they don't sink or drift away.;
, Fill a bucket, a bathtub, a cooler, or any large, watertight container with the coldest water that you can find. Supplement with ice, if possible. After you're done, try re-purposing the water: water your lawn, or your garden, or fill a pet's water bowl. Place your drinks in the ice water solution and rapidly stir them all around for 2-5 minutes. By stirring, you're using forced convection to speed the transfer of heat out of your drink and into the ice water solution.


Add as much ice to the water as you can, but not so much that it prevents the entire beverage container from being submerged into the water. A 50/50 mix of ice and water is a good rule of thumb.
The thicker and better-insulated the container, the better. Seal the container off from the air to retain even more of the chill. This way, the ice will melt more slowly.

, A small handful should do the trick. Salt lowers the freezing temperature of the water – which means that the water can get colder than the normal freezing temperature (32 degrees Fahrenheit or 0 degrees Celsius) without turning into ice.

, If you have access to a sink, you can cool beers quickly. Hold the beer under the faucet and run a steady stream of cold water over the container. You should be able to cool a beer within five minutes. Save the runoff water in a bucket so that you can re-purpose it.


If you don't have a sink, you can use a shower, a bath spigot, or any other water source.
Don't waste water. Save the runoff water in a bucket, then using it to wash dishes or water plants. Running the tap for five minutes just to cool beer is incredibly wasteful.

, Find a cold and accessible body of water: a river, a lake, a spring, a sea. Rig up a system to keep the beers from sinking or drifting. Tie the beers into a net or bag; string them together with rope; push them into the sand at the bottom; wedge them between roots, rocks, or kelp. If you cool your beers in running water, make sure to tie them to the bank, a boat, or yourself so that they aren't swept downstream.


Don't use hot water sources, such as hot springs or geysers. This is intuitive, but perhaps bears mention.
If there's a cold rain outside, try leaving the beers out where they'll catch the brunt of the elements. This may not cool them as effectively as a full submersion, but it should do the trick in time.

, If there's snow on the ground, simply wedge your beers into the snow and wait half an hour. If it's cold out—say, below 40 degrees—but there is no snow, you can still put the beers outside to cool. Try to leave them in the shade, not the direct sunlight. If the snow is deep enough, wedge the beers beneath the surface so that they cool more quickly.


If you leave beers beneath the surface of the snow, make sure that you mark the spot so that you don't forget where you've left them. Otherwise, you may be doomed to drink warm beers in the springtime.

Try chilling your beers with evaporative cooling.,
Find two clay pots.,
Insulate with sand.,
Wet the sand.,
Place the beers inside.,
Place a wet towel over the top.",How to Cool Beers Without a Fridge2," The concept: you will put the beers inside a clay pot, insulated by a layer of sand and a larger clay pot. Cover the top of the pot with a cold, wet towel. As the water evaporates, it cools the inside of the container. After an hour or two, you can put the beers inside and let them cool! You can use this method even on very hot days – you may be able to cool the inside of the pot to more than 40 degrees below the outside temperature.In a pinch, you can use smaller-scale evaporative cooling. Soak a towel, newspaper, or toilet paper with cold water, then wrap the beer inside. As the water evaporates, the beer should slowly cool., One should be large enough to hold 2-5 beers at once; the other should be large enough to hold the first pot with at least a half-inch of clearance on each side.Plug the bottom of each pot with clay, putty, cork – anything that will help retain the sand.


If you must use plastic pots (or another material), then you may. Bear in mind that clay is a better insulator, so a ""clay pot fridge"" will be more effective., You can use any sort of sand, although fine-grit river sand (as opposed to less dense sand with bigger grains) will insulate best. Fill the bottom inch of the largest pot with sand, then place the smaller pot inside. Carefully fill the space between the two pots until it is completely packed with sand. It's okay if you spill a bit of sand in the bottom of the smaller pot.







, Carefully pour icy-cold water into the gap between the two pots, all the way around. Let the water soak into the sand, but do not use so much water that it pools on top. You want the sand to be damp, but not muddy.








, Once the inside of the pot-fridge has sunk below about 50 degrees, you're ready to start cooling your beers. You might need to wait a few hours on a hot day, or a matter of minutes on a cold day. Check the beers every hour or so, but no more frequently.








, Thoroughly soak a towel with cold water, then wring it out so that it isn't sopping. Drape the towel taut across the rims of the two pots, and make sure that it covers the entire opening. Now, your ""clay pot fridge"" is complete. As the water evaporates from the sand and the towel, it will cool the interior of the pot. Leave the contraption to sit for a few hours before you place the beers inside. Once they're cold, they're ready to drink!









If you need to cool your beers quickly, then it's okay to put the beverages inside immediately. Bear in mind, however, that the interior may cool more quickly without the beverages taking up space – and that the process will still not be immediate.
Re-soak the towel with icy water as needed. As long as it's damp, you should be okay. If you move the towel, don't leave the ""fridge"" open for long, or else you'll lose all of the cool air.
Consider leaving a thermostat inside the pot. This will help you gauge how well your ""fridge"" is working, and it will give you a clue about when to insert the beers.

"
"
Consider burying your beers in cool, moist soil.,
Find a spot of cool, moist earth.,
Bury the beers.",How to Cool Beers Without a Fridge3," This method isn't as fast as the others, but it can keep bottles cool for long periods of time. This may be especially effective if it's a warm and sunny day. It's less messy if your containers are large, and it helps keep your beers chill if you're moving them from other cold storage.

, Look in the shade, not the beating sun. Try to bury your beers along the shore of a river, a lake, or a sea – but be careful if the tide is coming in. The wetter the soil, the better.


You can also pour water onto the ground to keep it moist. This may be the best choice if there is no body of water around, and you have water to spare,

, Dig a hole that's large enough for the beer container. Bury it up to the cap or lid; in general, deeper is cooler. Consider leaving the cap or lid exposed to keep it from getting dirty. If you bury the beers completely, make sure that you don't forget where you left them!"

Ignite; light the fuel on top.,
Cook.",How to Make a Simple Beverage Can Stove,";
, To cut the base, draw a straight, dashed line around one of the two beverage cans, approximately 1.5"" (3.5 cm) from the bottom of the can. If you find it difficult to make this line straight, you can put an elastic band around the can, untwist it to make it even; then follow this band around as you make your dotted line.

Neatly and carefully cut around this line, using one of the suggested cutting implements.







,
Draw a straight, dashed line approximately 1"" (2.5 cm) from the bottom of the can.
Turn it upside down so you can make the holes with the can still whole.






Around the rim of the upside down top, mark about 16 – 24 holes, evenly spaced (use a ruler or your fingers to space it out). Make more holes if your pin is very small; fewer holes if your pin size is larger.






Take a push pin and pierce each hole. If this proves difficult to achieve with hand pressure, gently tap in with a small hammer. Hold the hammer close to its head and tap gently, while holding the push pin between your thumb and first finger, just under the pin's head. Take care not to hit your fingers. The top of the push pin should be protecting them. Make the holes as small as possible. If the holes are too big, too much gas escapes and you will not get a good burn. This is the hardest part of the stove, getting a good hole sizing and pattern.






Try to keep all the holes the same shape to ensure even heating.







, There are two possible approaches to making the fuel drainage holes:


The first is to make a screw sized hole in the middle of the top. Get a short, fat sheet metal screw that will act as fuel hole cap. Make sure this fits snugly, to prevent fuel escaping from this hole.
The second method is to create a flower shape of the same small size as the pin holes made for the outer rim. To do it this way, make one hole in the center and 6 holes evenly spaced around the center hole. As these holes will be smaller, the fuel will drip through to the base, not pour through. This method is obviously easier if you do not have access to a screw but is a little slower than the first method for filling purposes.

, Once you have made the holes using the strength of the whole can, it is time to cut the top part. Cut it along the line you drew earlier.

, Once you have the top piece cut, you will need to create slits to allow the two halves of the stove to telescope together. Cut vertical slits with scissors, taking care not to cut past the rim of the can (the rounded part). Cut in about four to six even places (you can always cut a few more slits if the top isn't easing in gently). As an optional step, you could use a paper punch to make holes halfway up the can, then cutting the slits up to them. This will stop the can from tearing when trying to mate the two halves.

, At a pinch, you could even use sand. Perlite is a naturally occurring siliceous rock that is found in many parts of the world. You can purchase it at most gardening centers. In each case, the filling acts as a wick to hold the fuel and disburse it evenly and gradually.

, Once you have the filling in place in the base, and the slits made for the top, it is time to put the two pieces together. Steady the stove base by placing it on an even surface, such as a table top or flat ground. Take the top and gently but firmly push it down into the base of the stove until it fits snugly; shuffle the perlite or other filling around a little to help ease in the top. Some users recommend creating a wedge from some of the spare aluminum to ease it in. The top will now be sloping inwards (dimple), ready for pouring in your fuel.

, Make sure the stove is sitting on a surface free of flammable material. Choose a spot of ground free of plant matter, or put the stove on a pie plate or a dinner plate. Depending on which fuel holes you have used, proceed to adding your fuel. Only some fuels should be used in this type of stove (see ""Tips"" for these fuels):


Plugged hole - remove your fill hole plug (the metal screw). Slowly pour the fuel into the top, allowing it to drain into the fill hole. Fill the stove base about 1/4 to 1/2 way full. Replace the plug if you have used a large hole, to prevent further dripping of the fuel.
Flower shaped hole - pour the fuel into the stove base via the small holes in the dimple, until the stove base is about 1/4 to 1/2 way full. This method relies on the fuel dripping through the small holes, so it will not be as fast as the first method.

, Tip a little extra fuel (about a teaspoonful) in the dimple (middle) of the stove so that it pools there and even splash a little over the rim holes (it will burn off quickly).

, Hold a match, lighter or candle to the edge of the stove and move it around slowly. Since the stove has been primed, the heat will now travel down the sides of the can and heat the fuel inside.

, Put your cooking pans onto a stand and cook. You can make your own stand (see ""Tips"" below) or use a ready-constructed version. The fuel should burn for up to 15 minutes but this will depend on several variables, including the weather conditions, whether you are indoors or outdoors etc. Experiment to see how much time you get from the stove before trying to cook a meal.

Rinse it out if necessary and then fill it with clean water. Place it over the fire so it starts to boil while you eat., Once the water is boiling, carefully distribute it between three buckets. One bucket is for washing, one for rinsing, and one is for sanitizing your dishes. Fill each bucket about a quarter of the way full with water., In your first bucket, add a few drops of a liquid dish soap. The soap should be biodegradable to help protect the environment while you camp.Some soaps are specifically made for camping. Before leaving for your trip, see if you can find a camping-specific dish soap online or at a local department or hardware store.

, You can buy sanitizing agents online or at local hardware or camping stores. Check the label to see how many sanitizing tablets you should add to the bucket. Usually, the ratio is one tablet per gallon of water, but ratios will vary by brand.You may not have a means to measure the exact amount of water you're using. Just do your best to estimate.

, Use paper towels or cloths to wipe down your dishes immediately after eating. This removes any obvious scraps of food from your dishes.It's best to scrape your food into the fire. This way, the food will burn up and you won't risk attracting animals to your campsite.

, Place the dirty dishes in the wash tank one at a time. Scrub down the dishes thoroughly with the soapy water and clean rags. After the item is clean, shake off any suds before transferring it into the rinse tank.Start with the cleanest dishes and then move on to the dirtiest ones.

, Transfer the clean dish to the rinse pan after washing it. Dunk the dish in this tank briefly and swish it around to remove excess water.If you notice your dish is not completely clean when you place it in the rinse tank, move it back to the wash tank and give it a good cleaning.

, After your dishes are rinsed, set them in the sanitize tank. Briefly let the dishes soak in the sanitize tank to remove any lingering bacteria. This is especially important for dishes like knives and cutting boards, which harbor a lot of strong scents that can attract animals., Never let dishes stay wet after washing them. Use a clean towel to dry off your dishes after sanitizing them. You can then store your dishes for the night., After washing your dishes, pour all three buckets of water into a single bucket. It's best to dump the sanitize bucket into the rinse bucket and then dump the rinse buck into the wash bucket., Place a metal strainer or a similar device over one of the empty buckets. Pour the water over the sink to strain out any lingering food debris.Any solid waste should be transferred into your garbage or burned in the fire.

, You don't want to contaminate water sources with your dirty water. It's vital to be at least 200 feet away from a water source before dumping your dishes.Estimate if you don't have an exact means of measuring. Always go farther than you think you need to.

, As you dump the water, move the bucket around so it's dispersed over a large patch of land. Dispersing the water in a single spot is an environmental hazard."

, Synthetic cord is the most suitable for this task, especially if you're new to the art of Friction Fire. 550 Parachute cord is commonly used due to it's overall durability and resistance to wear. Other suitable options include: shoe lace, the roots and bark of certain trees, reverse wrapped plant fibers, and long strips of clothing that have either been braided or reversed wrapped.

, Hardwood is excellent, such as cedar, hemlock or oak. If you use a soft wood it will last a shorter time, although it will be easier to make a fire. It should be something you can hold down with your foot while kneeling. This will be what you drill into to make the ember that will start the fire. Make a small notch in the piece of wood where your drill piece can go. This drill piece is called the firebird.

, stick that is almost perfectly straight for the drill piece. Taking the bark off is better, but leaving it on is okay, if you lack a knife.

, The best thing to use is a fist sized rock with a small hole drilled into it from a harder rock, this is called a top rock. The hole is used to hold your spindle in place.

, Make sure the bow is not tight, but don't allow very much slack either. The string should not rebound if plucked.

, A tinder bundle is a fine bundle of tinder, which can be found from poplar trees on the inner layer of bark. Other materials will work, such as dry grass. The tinder bundle should resemble a birds nest. Your kindling should be smaller than a standard pencil.

, This should make the string much tighter. Finally, to make the ember, vigorously spin the drill on the piece of wood by moving the bow back and forth. Use your top rock to hold down the drill and keep it in place.

, If it starts to smoke, do not stop. It will smoke before an ember is created.

, BE CAREFUL! Blowing even slightly hard will disperse the punk, or the hot sawdust, ruining the ember. Then scoop the ember into the tinder bundle and blow into flame. Add kindling and work your way up to larger sticks.

If you are at a location that has a designated fire pit area (like a campsite), you should build your fire there. If you are in a more uninhabited area, you should clear away any flammable woodland debris extending at least 8 feet away, and build your bonfire there.Make sure your fire pit is not directly under any tree branches or hanging plants.;
, Scrape away at the area you intend to make your bonfire. The center section where you intend to build the fire should be a little depressed so the fire is more controlled, and the ember ashes have somewhere to fall.


This will also help the wood fall in on itself rather than falling outward.
Be sure to remove any leftover ash from previous fires. This will provide your bonfire with a clear base from which to start.

, Position rocks in a circle around the area you intend to build you fire. The rocks contain the bonfire while setting a boundary between the burning wood and flammable items.

, It is always a good idea to have a fire extinguisher nearby when building a fire. You may also want to consider keeping a bucket or two of water near your fire site. This will provide a backup for immediately putting out the fire, if need be.

, Tinder is very small pieces of dry material that catch fire quickly. Things like dry leaves, dry bark, dry grass, and any dry bits of wood are all ideal materials for tinder. Kindling is bigger (but still small) pieces of woodsy material that also catches fire quickly. Things like small branches and twigs (about the width of your fingers) are ideal materials for kindling.


It’s a good idea to have both tinder and kindling when making a fire, because they help to get the fire started, to help inflame the actual logs.
It is very important that the tinder and kindling materials are dry when creating a bonfire. Wet materials most likely not burn.
If the outside environment you’re building your bonfire in is wet and damp, you might want to consider bringing your own tinder and kindling. Things like balled up newspaper, ripped pieces of cardboard, and dryer lint are all good alternatives for tinder., Walk around your woodland area and collect pieces of wood that are approximately the width and length of your arm. The sizing can vary, but the fueling firewood should be the biggest and thickest pieces of wood you use to build your bonfire. The firewood needs to be relatively dry, so avoid wood that is really flexible, and has a lot of moss growth.


Burning wet wood will only result in creating a lot of smoke as the wood burns.
Collect about 20-25 pieces of firewood. This is only so you are prepared to add more wood and keep the fire going, if need be., Lay your tinder pieces inside the center of the designated bonfire area. Create a layer of tinder about a square foot wide., Stack and lean your kindling pieces on each other in a teepee style. Keep adding more kindling until you have a solid teepee structure. Then, add your bigger pieces of firewood to make the teepee structure bigger.


There are many ways to construct a fire (teepee style, lean-to style, log cabin style, top-down style, crossfire style, etc.), depending on the intended use of the fire. Since a bonfire is different from a campfire in that it meant to burn for a limited amount of time and is usually for celebratory gatherings (rather than cooking or burning over a long period of time to provide heat), a bonfire is typically assembled in a large, teepee style.Be sure to leave a space in the teepee on the side the wind is blowing. This will allow you an entrance space to light the inner tinder, while also allowing blowing wind to further increase the burning fire., Use a match or a lighter to light the tinder through the opening in the teepee. You can light the tinder from other sides as well.


As the fire burns and the wood starts to disintegrate, add bigger pieces of firewood to the fire. Be mindful to build upon and maintain the teepee shape, and not get any body parts too close to the flames.

, Sprinkle water onto the fire rather than pouring a bucket full of water over the pit.By sprinkling the water, you can gradually put out the flames. If you pour the water onto the pit, you will flood it, making too wet to use at a later time.

, Use a stick to mix around the ashes as you sprinkle water onto the pit. Mixing the ashes makes sure that all of the ashes are dampened and put out.

, Turn the back of your hand to face the remaining ashes.If you feel heat coming up from the ashes, they are still too hot to leave. Continue to sprinkle water on the ashes and mix them up. Once the ashes are no longer giving off heat, you have completely extinguished the bonfire.

Nail 2x4s between your main posts.,
Remove leaf matter and undergrowth.,
Place your wood bark side up.,
Fit the pieces together like a puzzle.,
Leave space between each piece of firewood.,
Stack the wood until it is 4 feet high (1.22 meters).,
Provide support for your stack.,
Sort your wood by size and shape.,
Place plywood and tall pieces of wood vertically.,
Stack 2x4s and irregular wood.",How to Stack Wood," The piece of ground you choose should have sun exposure to the south. Pick a piece of ground that is at least 8 feet (2.43 meters) long. In addition, verify that the piece of ground you pick runs perpendicular to the prevailing winds in your area., Dig two holes 2 feet (.6 meters) deep and 2 feet (.6 meters) apart on each side of the 8 foot (2.43 meter) section you choose. The holes should measure at least 2 inches (5 centimeters) by 4 inches (10 centimeters). The 4-inch (10 centimeters) section will be parallel to the other side of the 8-foot (2.43 meters) section of ground. Go to the other side of the 8-foot (2.43 meters) section and dig another two holes the same way.If you want, you can dig larger holes and substitute 2x4s for more substantial cuts of wood.

, Position the 2x4s into the hole so they are sticking straight up. The planks should line up with each other very closely. This is important, as you may want to nail 2x4s across the planks to tie them together.

Remember to make sure the longer part of the 2x4 faces across to the other set of holes.
You can substitute a stake or any other piece of wood for the 2x4 planks., Once your planks are in and line up with each other, fill in the holes. You can choose to refill them in with dirt, or you can refill them with rocks, clay, or even concrete. Whatever method you choose, the planks must line up with each other and be firmly in the ground.


Your rack should be able to store 1 full cord of wood. Typically, this is measured as 4 feet by 4 feet by 8 feet. (1.2 meters by 1.2 meters by 2.43 meters)., If you want, you can take 2x4s (or even smaller pieces of wood) and use them to tie your main posts together. Simply take them and nail them between the posts on either end of your 8-foot section of ground., Before placing your wood down on the ground, you’ll want to remove any leaf matter and other debris from the ground. This is important, as undergrowth and debris will retain moisture, which could lead to your wood rotting.

If you want, you can place a couple pieces of wood on the ground and cover them with pressure-treated 2x4s so most of your wood will be elevated. This will help keep your wood dry and reduce rot., Begin by placing your firewood bark side up against the 2x4s on one side of the rack. Since the average piece of firewood is 16 inches long (40 centimeters), you should be able to create three rows. Continue placing your wood in rows until you reach the far side of the rack.

By placing your wood bark side up, you’ll help it dry and stop it from leaching moisture down into the stack., When placing each piece of wood down, fit them together like a puzzle. If you have a wedge shape, try to fit it into a proper space. Fit square or rectangular pieces into square or rectangular holes., While you want to stack your wood together like a puzzle so that you fit a lot of wood on your rack, you need to make sure there is some space between your pieces. This will provide air flow so that your wood stays dry and does not rot.You may need to purposefully place some pieces so they don’t fit like a puzzle. Do this when appropriate.

, Continue stacking your wood – like a puzzle, but making sure there is air flow – until your pile has reached 4 feet high (1.22 meters). Don't go above 4 feet (1.22 meters), as your stack could topple., If you notice your stack leaning to one side, you can use poles or branches to prop up the stack. Simply place them at a 45-degree angle to the stack and press them into the ground a little bit., Create a pile for plywood, a pile for 2x4s, and a pile for irregular wood pieces. Like pieces should be placed together. This way, you’ll have an easier time stacking everything.

, Take your plywood and lean it against the poles you placed in the ground. The plywood should lean slightly onto the poles. Put the tallest/largest pieces of plywood against the polls and then place shorter/smaller pieces as you move inward on the rack.

Placing your plywood this way will make it easier for you to access it., Begin to stack your remaining wood on the other side of the rack. Place larger pieces on the bottom and slowly build up and place smaller pieces toward the top. If you have 2x4s or other long pieces that are longer than the area you have available, let them hang out the side of the rack."

Collect the leaves.,
Put the leaves somewhere sensible.,
Prepare yourself for the fire.,
Light the leaves.,
Keep watch.,
Safely put the fire out.",How to Set Fire to Leaves," There's no point trying to burn each and every leaf while it's still on the floor of your garden. Not only will it leave burnt leaves and ashes everywhere, it's very dangerous too. The fire can easily spread and burn your whole house down! To keep the fire safe and controlled, you need the leaves to be in one place. Use a rake or broom to sweep the leaves into one neat and tidy pile.;
, If you leave the leaves on the grass and burn them, the grass will obviously catch fire too. If you have a patio or a sheet of metal, put the pile of leaves on there. When they start burning, only the leaves will catch fire and nothing else. This means that the fire will be much more controlled and the risk of this going wrong is much lower.

, Before you throw a match into that annoying pile of leaves, you need to take some safety precautions.


Firstly, remove any baggy clothing. This doesn't mean strip naked, it means remove a baggy jumper or coat that could catch fire. T-shirts and jeans usually don't catch fire but try to wear something well-fitting just to be safe. Any ties must be removed or tucked in. Tie back long hair.






Keep a bucket of water nearby. Fill a large bucket with cold water in case something goes wrong and the fire needs to be put out quickly. More importantly, the bucket can be used if somebody else catches fire and needs to be saved. Alternatively, you can keep a garden hose nearby as long as the water can be turned on quickly.







, Although soaking the leaves in petrol and letting a cigarette fall from your mouth into them in slow motion sounds cool, it's actually pretty dangerous. Instead, light a small, but long, piece of wood and burn the leaves from a distance. You can also use a lighter that is quite long, not a small cigarette lighter. Light one or two leaves at first and let the fire spread. If the leaves aren't burning at all, add a small drop of white spirit into the pile. White spirit is highly flammable so only add a tiny bit.

, Constantly supervise the fire while it's lit to make sure nothing goes wrong. If you go to bed and let it burn, you may be waking up to the sound of sirens and the fire brigade! If it's a cold night, warm your hands over the fire. Don't get too close as you can burn yourself, use your head. If it's a hot summers day, sit back with a sandwich or lemonade and enjoy the heat on your face. If the fire does spread to somewhere it's not supposed to go, use the bucket of water to put it all out and start the burning process. It may sound extreme but it's better than letting some of it still burn only to have the same thing happen again.

, When all the leaves are burnt, you may be left with a pile of ash that looks like it's gone out. To be safe, pour some water over it and then sweep the ashes up. Dispose of them by putting them into the bucket of water. This will help you be 100 percent sure that all of the fire has gone out. It will also make sure that your house and everybody inside it -including you- is 100 percent safe. Pour the bucket of ash and water down a drain once you're satisfied that the fire has gone out.

Repeat the steps until the fire is cool to the touch.",How to Put Out a Campfire1," Fill a bucket with water and pour it on top of the campfire. Don't stand directly above or downhill from the fire to avoid inhaling smoke or hot steam.Continue pouring water over the fire until all the hissing from the hot embers stops., Use a stick or shovel to mix up the ashes and embers into the soil. As you stir the remnants of the fire, you may uncover more red embers or burning wood which must be extinguished before you leave., Use your stick or shovel to scrape off any partially burnt sticks or logs to ensure that they are fully extinguished. This may reveal more burning embers under the surface of the wood., After you've stirred the fire thoroughly, you'll want to add more water to it to extinguish any remaining embers that may have come off burning pieces of wood., Put your palms up next to logs and coals. If you don't feel any heat radiating off of them, you can touch them with your hands.Any warm or hot pieces of your fire must be doused down with more water.

, Continue dousing the area and mixing the soot and embers to ensure that you've put out the fire fully. The fire is fully extinguished when it's completely cool to the touch.

The rocks surrounding the fire should be cool to the touch when the fire is fully extinguished.

If the glass needs clearing, pour in a bit of hot water, and when you shake it, the white coating will come right out. This is not necessary for already clear light bulbs. After you rinse it a few times, you should have a crystal clear bulb.

,, You've just created a makeshift magnifying glass.

, To use it, focus the sun through the magnifying glass and onto a piece of paper (or wood); it should start smoking, and a minute later, burst into flames. Transfer the paper to pre-prepared kindling in a suitable fire pit and you'll soon have a campfire to be proud of.

Do not add logs to your fire if you know you are leaving soon so that the fire can stop burning. If you need to extinguish the fire quickly, this is not an ideal method. Instead, use water to put out your fire., Use a shovel or a long stick to poke the embers left over in the fire. Uncover large unburnt logs or sticks to make sure that there are no embers remaining under the ashes., You just want enough dirt or sand to smother the embers and to extinguish the fire fully. Do not cover or bury the fire, as this could create a fire under the surface of the dirt that could reignite later and will make the sand or dirt incredibly hot., Put your hand a couple of inches away from the coals in the fire to make sure that it's cooled off. If it still feels warm, repeat the steps until the ashes are completely cooled."

Find your supplies.,
Cut the cloth.,
Attach the wick to the torch.,
Soak the cotton wick with flammable liquid.,
Light the torch.",How to Make Torches1," A minimalistic torch is ideal when you don’t have access to many resources, such as when you're in the woods without the right equipment. To make this kind of fast-burning torch in an emergency, you'll need:Green stick or branch that’s at least 2 feet (61 cm) long and 2 inches (5 cm) thick
Cotton cloth or birch bark
Fuel, such as kerosene, naphtha-based camp fuel, lighter fluid, or rendered animal or vegetable fat
Matches or lighter;
, A torch needs a wick, just like a candle does. You can use strips of cotton to make the wick, such as from an old cotton t-shirt. Cut or tear the fabric into strips that are 1 foot (30 cm) wide and 2 feet (61 cm) long.


Alternatively, you can use a strip of birch bark if you don’t have fabric. Find a birch tree and peel a strip that’s about 6 inches (15 cm) wide and 2 feet (61 cm) long.If you're using bark, you'll also need twine, rope, string, or some reeds to tie it in place.

, Position the widthwise end of the cotton strip at the top of the green branch. Wrap the strip snugly around the top of the torch, wrapping in the same place to form a thick bulge. When you reach the end of the fabric, tuck the end underneath the wrapped fabric to secure it in place.For birch bark, wrap the bark snugly around the end of the torch. When you get to the end of the bark, hold the bark in place and tie a string or reed around the top and bottom of the wick to hold the bark in place.

, A cotton wick needs to be soaked in a flammable liquid before you can light the torch, because it’s actually the fluid that will burn and not the fabric. Place the wick end of the torch into the fuel and let it soak for a few minutes to ensure the fabric is saturated.


With a birch wick, you don’t have to soak the wick because the bark contains natural resins that will burn., Use a light, matches, or a campfire. Hold the torch upright and hold the flame to the base of the wick until the wick ignites. This may take about a minute. Once lit, the torch should last at least 20 minutes, and could burn as long as an hour.A birch wick may only burn for about 15 minutes.


Don’t burn your torch in dry, heavily wooded areas, as you could set the surrounding wood on fire.
Don’t burn the torch inside houses or buildings.
Hold the torch at arm’s length to avoid burning yourself.

Use tree bark.,
Search near bodies of slow-moving water for cattails, sometimes called bull rushes.,
Locate trees with patches of tinder fungus, a specific growth that works excellently as tinder.,
Whittle bamboo reeds into thin shavings.,
Gather other plant materials in nature.",How to Make Tinder for a Fire1," The type of tree will vary depending on your location. The most important characteristic of the bark is that it is dry. Break off the inner bark and shred or break it into small strips or chips, depending on the strength of the wood.

Do not strip bark unless absolutely necessary. Cutting bark can damage or kill trees. Ideally, pick bark that is on dead trees, on the ground, or the like. Peeling bark off trees should only be done in an actual emergency.
Different barks burn differently. As natural material, they also will burn differently depending on your environment, the season, and in your weather conditions.
Choose cedar, if possible. You can spot a cedar tree by its reddish-brown fibrous bark that is easy to shred with your hands.



 


Cut off a chunk of cottonwood bark with whatever sharp tool you have and whittle away the outer bark until you can see the cord-like strands on the inside. Cottonwood bark has a soft characteristic that can, like cedar bark, be stripped into small pieces. ;
, Cattails are common throughout Europe and America and are abundant around swamps and ponds.

You want to use the bushy, cotton-like material on the top of the stem which flourishes in the fall as the plant goes to seed. Simply snap it off and ignite.






In mid to late summer, cattails bloom into a brown sausage-shaped substance on the top of the cattail. This part of the plant works for tinder as well. Snap it off and break or cut it open to get to the driest material possible. , Cut off a large piece and break it into smaller chunks if it is sufficiently dry.

Tinder fungus predominantly grows on birch trees, which can be identified by their white bark, and has the appearance of a chunk of burnt or blackened crusty bark.






If the material is wet, you can slowly air-dry the fungus over time for later use. ,


Holding a knife at a right angle with the blade pointing away from your body, run the blade back and forth to create small shavings. Your shavings should look similar to sawdust.

, In a pinch, almost any dry plant material can be used as tinder. This includes dry grass, leaves, sticks, dry pine needles, cotton fabric, or natural twine or rope. These may not be the easiest materials to ignite, but they will kindle a fire in desperate situations.

Gather your supplies.,
Find a cattail.,
Soak the cattail with flammable liquid.,
Assemble and light the torch.",How to Make Torches2," A cattail torch is another type of minimalistic torch that requires only a few simple items. With this type of torch, the spike on the end of the plant will be soaked in flammable fluid. Along with the cattail, you'll also need:


Hollow reed, stick, cane, or bamboo piece
Fuel
Matches or lighter

, The best place to look for cattails is around the perimeter of lakes, ponds, marshes, and other wetland areas. You may also know this plant by the names reedmace, cumbungi, or bulrush.Because cattails are rather flimsy, you'll also need to find a hollow stick or cane that you can insert the cattail into. The stick will act as a holder. Make sure it’s at least 2 feet (61 cm) long.

, Place the cattail into your flammable liquid or oil. Let the cattail soak for at least an hour. This will give the spike time to absorb lots of oil, which means a longer burning torch.Good fuels for this purpose include kerosene, naphtha-based camp fuel, lighter fluid, or rendered animal or vegetable fat

, When the cattail is done soaking, insert the bottom of the cattail into your hollow stick so the oil-soaked spike is protruding from the top of the stick. With a lighter or matches, hold a flame to the bottom of the spike until it ignites.


A cattail torch could give you up to six hours of flame.Don’t burn these torches inside or near other flammable objects.
Hold the torch away from your body to avoid burns.

Cut the Kevlar fabric into a strip.,
Attach the Kevlar to the pole.,
Wrap and secure the fabric.,
Dip the wick in fuel.,
Light the torch.",How to Make Torches3," This type of torch requires more tools and specialized equipment than the other types. This is not a minimalistic torch that you can make in an emergency. To make this type of torch, you'll need:Aluminum pole that’s at least an inch (2.5 cm) thick and 2 feet (61 cm) long
Kevlar fabric
Kevlar twine
Scissors
2 quarter-inch (6 mm) self-drilling aluminum screws
Drill or screwdriver
Bucket
Naphtha-based camp fuel
Old towel
Matches or lighter

, Use the scissors to cut a strip of Kevlar fabric that’s about 4 inches (10 cm) wide and 2 feet (61 cm) long. You can buy Kevlar fabric at some home stores, department and hardware stores, fabric stores, or online.


Kevlar is a durable synthetic fabric that’s made from plastic. However, it’s flame-resistant and doesn’t melt, making it ideal for torches.Kevlar is often used by fire jugglers and fire poi performers.

, Place the widthwise end of the fabric strip at the top of the pole. Drill or screw a self-drilling screw through the fabric and into the pole at the top and bottom edges of the fabric. Position the screws a half-inch (13 mm) from the top and bottom edges.Aluminum has a smooth surface, and to prevent the Kevlar wick from sliding down the torch, you have to secure it in place with screws.
It’s important to use aluminum for the pole and screws, because aluminum won’t conduct the heat from the torch.

, Once the fabric is screwed to the pole, wrap the Kevlar wick around the end of the pole. Pull on the fabric as you wrap so it’s nice and snug. When you reach the end of the fabric, tie it in place with lengths of Kevlar twine.Use two pieces of twine to tie the fabric, one near the top and bottom of the wick.

, Fill a bucket with at least 4 inches (10 cm) of camp fuel. Dip the wick into the fuel and let it sit for a couple minutes to soak. Remove the torch from the bucket and let the excess fuel drip onto an old towel.

, With matches or a lighter, hold a flame to the bottom of the wick until it ignites. This Kevlar torch will burn for several hours. You can also put the flame out and reuse the torch later.To put out the flame before it burns out, cover the top with a metal container, such as a soda can with the top cut off. Hold the can there to smother the flame until the torch goes out.

Set the container atop an already flaming fire for about five minutes.






Remove the container from the fire using tongs and allow to cool.






Open the container and observe the squares. They should be blackened in color., The steel wool you use to scour your pots can be excellent tinder and all you have to do is light it.

, Finally, that annoying lint that you have to clean out of your dryer every time you put in a new load has a use! Simply collect enough lint to form it into a long rod-shaped mold and ignite.

, The petroleum grease ignites extremely easily.

, A rolled-up newspaper, the cover of a paperback novel, or whatever paper material is available to you will help get a fire started. While you wouldn't want to turn your map into tinder, any spare paper can work to ignite a fire, though it requires more patience than some of the other methods.

Find an empty metal tin.,
Punch a hole in the lid.,
Choose natural fabric.,
Cut the fabric into pieces.,
Fill the container.,
Put on a ventilated heat source.,
Wait until it stops smoking.,
Let the tin cool.,
Inspect the cloth.",How to Make Char Cloth1," Many people use breath mint tins, but any clean, metal container will do. Clean the inside.


To make a large amount of char cloth, use a paint can or oatmeal can. Check that they're 100% metal, with no plastic or rubber parts.
For a can without a lid, wrap the top tightly with aluminum foil.;
, Stab a hole in the top with an awl or a nail and hammer. It should be about large enough to stick the tip of a pen through, but not the whole pen. Gases and hot air will escape through this hole, preventing the tin from exploding.If the hole is too large, air may enter the tin and set the cloth on fire, burning it to ash instead of char cloth.
If your tin has a hinged lid, a little air can get in through the hinge.This isn't a disaster, but you might get better results if you enlarge one of the hinge holes instead of punching a new one.

, An old, clean 100% cotton T-shirt or pair of denim blue jeans are good options. White cloth is best, since it's easy to tell when it's charred and there's no risk that dye will interfere. Most dyed cloth will work fine, but never use cloth that contains synthetic material. Here are a few more suggestions:Loosely woven fabrics (easy to light): cotton shirt, cheesecloth, rolled up cotton balls, linen, jute, hemp
Heavy fabrics (long-burning): denim, cotton web belt, natural canvas, soft cotton washcloth, hemp rope

, The fabric will shrink during charring, so 2 inch (5 cm) squares of fabric will leave you with a small but manageable piece of char cloth.There's no need to measure exactly or get even edges. Just eyeball the size and cut up the fabric with a pair of scissors.


All pieces should be small enough to lay flat inside the tin. Rolled up pieces may not char evenly.Bigger pieces will burn longer, which can be an advantage if your tinder is damp. Of course, you'll get fewer uses out of a pile of large pieces.

, Drop the fabric squares into the container, keeping them mostly flat. You can leave space in the tin or nearly fill it, as long as you don't tamp down the fabric.

, The charring cloth will let off bad-smelling and potentially toxic smoke. Set up a heat source outside over non-flammable ground. If you do this indoors, make sure the area is well-ventilated and fireproof. Here are some options you might have available in a camping or survival situation:


Camping stove turned to minimum flame.
Bed of hot coals from a fire (or from a grill)
Grease candle — make your own with a jar, leftover cooking fat, and a wick., The cloth inside the tin will partly fall apart into gas and ash, leaving ready-to-light carbon behind.The smoke and fire (burning gas) leaving the hole is a good sign. Just leave the can until these die down.


This can take anywhere from 5 to 50 minutes, but it's usually done within 15. Larger tins and lower temperatures make the process longer.
Keep the can upright, so the hole is on the top or upper side.
Large cans sometimes have trouble heating all the cloth. Using tongs or a poker, turn them or roll them in the coals to make sure no more gas needs to be burned off.

, Remove the tin from the fire or coals. Place it on a fireproof surface. Wait until it's cool enough to touch.


Optionally, place your nail or other tool back in the hole to stop fresh oxygen from entering the cooling can. The newly made charcloth inside is burning hot, and may spontaneously ignite if you let too much oxygen into the tin.

, You should end up with completely black charcoal, with the fiber patterns still visible. You should be able to pick it up and transport it without it falling apart.Peel apart the pieces and store them in a waterproof bag for emergencies or camping convenience.


If the cloth isn't fully black, return it to the tin and heat again. Make sure there is no smoke leaving the tin before you take it off.
If the cloth crumbles to dust when touched, then you left it on the fire too long. Try again with new fabric.

Make sure that you can legally build a campfire.,
Acquire a campfire permit, if necessary.,
Find a low, dry, sheltered space.,
Build the fire pit.,
Practice fire safety.",How to Start a Campfire1," If the season or region is particularly dry, there might be restrictions on when, where, and why people can light fires. Check the local fire restrictions online or at a ranger station before you go. Some areas require you to register a campfire permit. You may only be able to build fires in designed ""campfire"" spots.Respect the fire restrictions. They are in place for a reason! Only you can prevent forest fires.;
, In the U.S., many National Forest and Bureau of Land Management areas require you to carry a permit for building a flame outside of a designated fire pit area. Visit any Forest Service, Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Bureau of Land Management office to ask for a permit sheet. In some areas, such as California, you can download a campfire permit online., In order to protect your fire from the wind, you should build your campfire on ground that is lower than the land around it. Consider setting up the fire in an alcove against a rock or cliff face that will protect the flames from the wind – but be careful not to leave burn marks on the rock! Make sure that the ground is dry, and that there is no chance of your spot being exposed to rain.


If you are in a forest, look for a large clearing and build your fire near the center. This way, the flames won't lick too close to the surrounding trees.
If you're expecting rain, you have two options: build the fire within a natural shelter, like a cave or an overhang; or tie up your own protective cover using a tarp or a tent fly.

, First, dig a shallow hole—no more than 3-8 inches deep— so that the fire is protected from the wind. Then, line the rim of the pit with stones or a thick berm of earth. This protective barrier will help retain the heat, and it should keep the fire from spilling beyond its boundaries.


Use large stones (as big as your hand) to build the bulk of the barrier, then use smaller stones and soil to fill the cracks. Try to choose dry stones.
If you cannot dig, you should still try to build a protective perimeter. Clear any twigs and leaves at least two feet away from the edge of your fire circle.

, Keep a water source nearby to extinguish the fire if need be. Make sure to clear flammable objects from the perimeter of the fire pit. Sweep away dry leaves, pine needles, twigs, and other things that might accidentally catch aflame. Clear a swath at least a foot wide.


In a pinch, you can put out a fire by quickly shoveling earth or sand over the top. However, there is no substitute for water.

Gather firewood, kindling, and tinder.,
Build a Fire.,
Lay the cloth on your tinder.,
Light the char cloth.,
Spread the flame.,
Place the tinder under the kindling.",How to Make Char Cloth2," Char cloth won't burn hot enough to light a log all by itself. Just like any fire, you'll need tinder (dry grass, bark shavings, newspaper), kindling (twigs and small branches), and of course the logs themselves. Char cloth makes it easy to start this chain and light the tinder.


Char cloth is most useful during damp weather, when tinder is more difficult to light.

, Find a fire pit or a large dirt area cleared of all vegetation. Avoid areas with overhanging branches. Stack your kindling, then the wood on top of it, allowing plenty of room for oxygen. Here are a couple straightforward methods:For cooking: Arrange a ""teepee"" of vertical kindling, then a larger teepee of firewood around it.
For a long-lasting fire: Lay the kindling criss-cross, then criss-cross the firewood over the kindling.

, Place one square of char cloth on top of a bundle of tinder. Be ready to pick up the tinder and shove it underneath the kindling once it's alight.

, You can light char cloth with a flint and steel or other portable sparking device (including a lighter that's run out of fluid). As soon as a spark lands on it and forms a glowing red patch, you're good to go. There are two common ways to aim the spark:Hold the flint directly over the cloth, angled downward. Run the steel downward across the flint so sparks land on the cloth.

Or hold the cloth against a sharp edge of the flint. Run the steel along this edge.

, Blow on the glowing char cloth to get the heat to spread across it. Pick up the tinder bundle and gently push the sides up and over the cloth, until they start burning., As soon as the tinder starts burning, place it and the char cloth underneath the kindling. The fire should now spread to the kindling, then the wood.

Get a used, washed tin can.,
You can take off the label if you're a bit of a square but it will probably just burn anyway so it doesn't matter.

,

Build a ""tipi"" or lean-to of logs.,
Gather kindling: twigs, leaves, and bark.,
Gather small branches.,
Prepare your tinder.",How to Start a Campfire2," Search around your campsite for logs and large branches. The logs should be thick – about the diameter of your leg above the knee. Make sure to use dry, clean logs; avoid wood that is rotting, mossy, or waterlogged. Prop three or four logs against each other so that they provide shelter for your kindling, but also allow plenty of air to flow through your fire.Set aside extra logs for later. They will form the primary fuel for the fire once you've gotten it going.
if you want a fire just for the evening, use softwood—pines, firs, and other trees with needles—as it will burn faster. If you want your fire to burn through the night, use hardwood: trees with leaves, like oak and birch.

, This is the first part of your fire that will catch.Make sure that they are completely dry. Depending on the ecosystem, it may take time to find enough twigs – so be patient. Search beneath trees and bushes where these bits may have fallen. Make a small pile of twigs near the campfire site. Then, when they are gathered, carefully stack them in the center of the fire pit, between the legs of the ""tipi.""

, These should be no thicker than an inch in diameter – about as thick as your thumb. Collect an armload or two of these branches. Once you have these branches, put them on top of your dry twigs in the fire pit.


If you are burning hardwood, you want to use only fallen branches that are dead and very dry. If you are burning softwood, you can take the branches directly off the tree, needles and all.

, This is the flammable material that you will burn to get the fire going. You can use thin bark, dry leaves, newspaper, cardboard, pine needles – anything that will catch fire quickly and ignite the wood.Think of it as ""fuse"" that leads to your bed of dry twigs and leaves. Set aside plenty of tinder so that you can light the fire in several spots.

"
"
Protect the fire pit from the wind.,
Light the tinder.,
Stack more branches on the fire.,
Put a log on the fire.,
Maintain the fire.,
Know how to put out a campfire.",How to Start a Campfire3," Get down on your knees and place your tinder underneath your twigs. Place yourself between the fire and the wind. If there is a lot of wind, use your logs to create a barrier which will stop the breeze from buffeting your fire.

, Strike a match or a lighter, then hold the flame directly beneath your paper. The tinder will catch and begin to burn. Use the same match to light the tinder in multiple places. Watch the fire carefully to make sure that the kindling (twigs, leaves, bark) catches and stays ablaze.


Try fanning the flames to push airflow through the kindling. Fire catches best when there is a slight breeze, but not enough to blow it out.

, As the kindling catches, proceed to place larger and larger branches on top of it until you can no longer see the flames. Be patient, and don't add too much at once. Make sure to leave plenty of gaps for airflow – you don't want to suffocate the fire.

, Once the blaze burns through the larger branches, heave one large log onto the top of the kindling. Again, make sure not to stifle the fire. After ten minutes, put two more logs onto the fire, along with a few more large branches. Add fuel every 45 minutes, or as needed.

, Keep an eye on the flame to make sure that it doesn't get out of control; watch where the sparks are landing, and be aware of where the wind is blowing. From time to time, stoke the heart of the fire with a long stick to push the embers to the surface. Knock off charred portions of log in order to expose new wood to the flame. When the fire gets low, add more branches or another log.

, Make sure to extinguish the flames before abandoning the campsite, going to sleep, or otherwise leaving the fire unattended. If possible, wait for the fire to naturally burn down to the embers. Start by shoveling dirt or sand into the pit to subdue the blaze. Then, when the fire is just coals, pour water over the embers until they have cooled – when they are no longer giving off steam.Avoid pouring water directly onto a blazing fire. This will extinguish the flames quickly, but it will also throw up a large cloud of dust and steam. Be patient.
When the fire is out, fill in the pit completely with dirt. If you are camping in the backcountry, consider scattering the stones, rearranging the leaves, and returning the space to the way it was when you found it.

Get tinder and kindling.,
Use dry firewood.,
Start with softwood, sustain with hardwood.,
Add oxygen to fan your flames.",How to Keep a Fire Burning1," Tinder and kindling are small bits of wood, twine, or paper get your fire going easily. Tinder is the material that will burn easily even with a small spark, making your fire start. Kindling is more substantial and will sustain your fire. You need both to make a good, durable fire.


Good tinder materials: Newspaper, cotton swabs, and toilet paper work well if you have them at your campsite. If you need more natural materials try dry leaves, Cattail fluff, and Birch bark.Good kindling materials: Dried twigs, small, thin pieces of wood like sticks and broken tree branches. Dried leaves also work well.
Keeping a fire burning is a cycle. Start with tinder, then add kindling, and finally wood. To keep your fire from going out, you’ll have to repeat the process throughout.;
, All the wood you use to build your fire should be completely dry. If there's any moisture left in the wood, it will be harder to keep a fire going. Instead, you might end up with a pile of smoking wood. If dry wood is not available, use extra kindling and tinder to combat any moisture.Stay away from recently chopped trees, as they have a lot of water still and won’t contribute to a sustaining fire.

Seasoned firewood is the best, because it has been left to dry out for months or even years. If firewood has been seasoned properly, it will catch quickly and sustain a nice burn.
When outdoors at a campsite or in the woods, look for fallen logs, or find an older tree to chop down. Oak and birch trees are abundant in the United states and are nice, hardwoods which can burn hot, but allow for a longer, sustained fire.

, Weigh the options of using Hardwood vs. Softwood. Softwood is good for building up a fire, and hardwood will help you keep the fire going.


Softwoods like pines and firs are easier to light but burn down quickly. If you’re trying to keep a fire going that’s burned down, add softwood to quickly draw a larger flame.
Hardwood is harder to light when starting a fire, but lasts for a very long time, and burns with more heat.A solution to keeping your fire burning is to start the fire with softwood and switch to hardwood when you have a good, stable flame with some embers.

, Make sure the fire has enough ventilation, preferably from all sides. This can be obtained by building your fire on top of a grate if you have one. Put some paper product (such as newspaper) in the middle of your fire, on top of the grate before placing your wood.


Stack the new firewood with a lot of space between the logs to get proper ventilation.
Frequently add more tinder and kindling to the open spaces between your logs.
Blow on you fire. This is especially useful when you are just lighting the fire, to make it bigger.
If you need to quickly restart a fire that’s gone out, gather up all your embers into a pile. Use your embers as a bed to stack on more tinder and kindling. Then, when you see a flame to start to rise, add more wood. Use softwood if possible.

"
"
Start small.,
Wrap your wood in a towel before trying to burn.,
Use smaller logs, sticks, and anything else at your disposal.",How to Keep a Fire Burning2," If it’s raining, or has recently rained and you don’t have access to dry firewood, it’s still possible to keep your fire burning. It just takes more effort and patience.


Focus on building up a small flame in one area of your fire pit. The larger the wet area and material, the harder it will be to create enough heat for a sustainable fire.
Use extra tinder and kindling. Don’t try to light a whole log just yet. Work on building a flame with paper and sticks.
Birch trees have good bark for quick burning even when it’s raining as the bark has natural oils which repel moisture.
If you can, place a tarp or something over your fire to block any rain. Just make sure it’s enough to prevent scorching or catching fire.

, Use a dry towel or even dry clothes to wrap all of your wood and burning materials in. Damp the wood down and try your best to suck up as much moisture as possible.


If you suspect you may encounter rain, grab a canister before you go out and fill it with dry twigs, pine cones and needles. An oatmeal tin works great for storing small kindling and will keep it dry.
When burning a fire outdoors, it’s always a good idea to have extra logs which you keep wrapped up just in case of rain.

, A grouping of smaller logs and kindling will be easier to light individually than one large log. In addition, you can try to light anything that will burn to get your fire started, or keep it going.


Waterproof matches, a lighter, or flint and steel are your best best for sparking a flame.
Foods that have a lot of carbohydrates can also be used as fuel in a pinch. Foods like chocolate and marshmallows work well.
If you have a hatchet or other way to split logs, use it. Split logs down the middle to expose the dry area. Stand the logs up and face the dry bark towards the flame.

"
"
Remove any excess ash from your fireplace before building a fire.,
Stoke your fire regularly.,
Add kindling and tinder regularly.,
Add Hardwood logs.",How to Keep a Fire Burning3," An Ash bed of 1-2 inches should always be maintained, this helps protect the floor of the firebox and will also assist in catching embers and radiating heat.


Excess ash in the base of your fireplace can pile up and hamper any new material from being able to burn quickly and properly.
Excess ash can also be a potential health hazard.

, If the fire seems to die out, use a long stick or a fire poker to move the logs around. You should also blow on them to provide a burst of oxygen. Keep working on the fire until it seems to be stable again, if you neglect it, it will go out.Use your poker to keep your coals together. Red, hot charcoal burns hot and will provide enough heat to quickly light tinder, kindling, and softwood. Coals will get hotter and hotter as you accumulate them with the fire poker/stick and retain plenty of heat for a long time.
As the wood burns down to charcoal, make the charcoal glow red by poking and blowing air onto it. Then add on some more tinder, kindling and firewood.

, Sometimes, when burning a fire in your fireplace at home, parts of your logs may not get hot enough to catch fire. To Keep your fire burning longer, frequently add more kindling and tinder before adding logs to create more flames and heat, helping your logs burn.


If you have an elevated grate in your fireplace, place your kindling and tinder under the grate so that the flames can raise up beneath the logs.
If you don’t have space under your logs, stuff the material in between the logs with a poker.

, Place new logs on your fire so that there is still space for the fire to breathe. You don’t want to smother what fire you have.Larger hardwood logs are great for sustaining an already burning fire. If the fire is hot enough, the hardwood logs won’t take too long to start burning.
If your fire is dying out, mix some softwood logs in as well to quickly draw a larger flame.

Understand the value of tinder.,
Once tinder catches and begins to smolder, help it along.",How to Make a Campfire Without Matches1," When you don't have matches or a reliable source of flame, tinder is essential for starting a fire with one of the suggested methods below. Tinder consists of very fine, very dry plant material, piled into a loose heap in the fire pit. Tinder must be very dry––there is no way of getting around this. Suitable types of tinder include:


Bark, coniferous pitch, lint, punk (the insides of rotting tree trunks), shaved resin, dead and dry leaves, crushed dead and dry leaves, bird's nests, dry grasses, etc.
If you have alcohol or fuel, these can be used to saturate the tinder and make it more susceptible to burning.

, Blow on it gently or fan it until it turns into a strong flame. Once this happens, you can slowly start to feed the kindling onto the fire, followed by the wood fuel last.

Open the main fuel valve slightly until you hear a gurgling sound.,
Get ready with your match or lighter and open the main fuel valve while applying the flame inside the lantern just below the mantle.,
After several hours of use if lantern the starts to dim, rotate the cleaning lever several times again to clear the generator tip and/or add more air pressure using the pump.,
Close fuel valve fully to shut off lantern.,
Make sure lantern is fully cool before placing in any container or opening the cap on the fount.

",How to Light a Liquid Fuel Lantern," The tank (fount) may be under pressure so open slowly.;
, A funnel that has a filter will ensure the cleanliness of the fuel. If the lantern is capable of using unleaded gasoline, then it can be used. If the lantern is for use with Coleman liquid fuel, then this is the only type that should be used. Coleman fuel is preferred due to the cleaner burning as compared to unleaded gasoline.

, If the lantern does not have mantles installed or the old ones have a hole in them, they will need to be installed or replaced. Tie the mantle(s) on the burner tube and cut off the excess string. The instructions should be on the package. With a match or lighter, hold just beneath the mantle and it will burn. Allow the mantle to burn until it turns into a white ash. Once it turns into a white ash, it will be fragile so if it gets touched or bumped, it will break. Never use a mantle that has a hole in it. This will let a jet of hot gas shoot out of the hole and could burn the glass globe. Reinstall the glass globe and reassemble the lantern.

, What you are doing is unlocking the check valve so air can flow through it. With your thumb over the hole in the pump handle, give it 30-40 full strokes. This will build up air pressure inside the tank (fount). After pumping is complete, turn the valve to the right until it closes all the way.

, The lantern, if it's older should have some sort of small lever sticking either out of the back or out the side of the frame. This could resemble a small brass wire either bent over or bent into a small loop. Rotate this lever in a circle, either direction, for a couple of turns. This is clearing the generator tip where the fuel/air mixture will come out of. If it's a newer lantern, rotate the main valve wheel fully open and closed several times, this also is clearing the generator tip.

, This is the fuel/air mixture being released from the generator tip into the mantle. If you just hear air, you may have a fuel air tube problem.

, It should light on fire. Flames may be visible inside the globe and may go up into the vent hood. This is normal. Once the mantle produces enough heat, the generator, the small brass tube behind or near the mantle, will heat to the point when the fuel is converted to a gas. Once this happens, the flames will subside and a bright glow will appear. Open main fuel valve fully.

, The lantern should remain bright for several hours with a clear tip and the initial air pressure that was applied. If the lantern dims after a short time, a half hour or so, it may be leaking pressure.

, The lantern may burn for up to a minute or so while the remaining fuel is burned off.

You can light the newspaper in your hand and then place it in the middle of the wood.






You can place the newspaper in the middle first and then light it. If you are using twigs and leaves, place them in the middle of the wood FIRST before lighting them. They are smaller so it is unsafe to light them in your hand before placing in the center.

Survey your camping site for a place that is safe to build your fire pit that is safe for you and for your surroundings:


Select an area that is level and downwind.,
Dig a pit with a shovel to a depth of at least 12” (304.8 mm).

,
Place rocks around the perimeter of your fire pit.

,
Fill the pit 2/3 full with dry kindling and firewood.

,
Have a bucket of water and a shovel nearby so that you can quickly extinguish the fire should it threaten to get out of control.

,
Pour water on the fire when you are ready to leave.",How to Build a Campfire Pit,"
The spot you select should be at least 15’ (4,572 mm) from your tent and other campers and not directly underneath low hanging branches.
Clear away all debris in a 10’ (3,048 mm) diameter circle. Brush away all combustible materials, such as leaves and twigs. You can use a broom or a snow brush.;
,,,,, Shovel dirt on top of the wet ashes and stir the dirt and ashes around to make sure there are no burning embers.

"
"
Choose an area nearby to search.,
Learn the history of your area.,
Look for flint nodules in larger rocks.",How to Identify Flint1," It might seem like flint is difficult to find, but you generally just need to know where to look. In some areas, like the Ozarks of Missouri, you can find chert lying all over the ground. That is because flint and chert are hard, durable rocks that are so resistant to weathering they remain intact long after the surrounding rocks have weathered away into the soil.You can search along the freshwater shores or riverbeds.Flint is very durable and resistant to chemicals, so it often collects in the remaining soils as surrounding carbonate rocks erode.While rocks like limestone erode and fine soil is carried downstream, small pebble deposits of flint and chert collect along the shores.
Try other locations where there is a large variety of rocks present, such as a construction site or along a gravel road. Many times rocks are harvested from riverbeds for construction from all over so you might be surprised to find chert or flint pebbles just down the block.;
, If you live near an area that was once populated by tribes of Native Americans, you might have a good chance of locating flint fragments around that area.


Flint was an ideal choice for creating tools and weapons. Flint can be made to form a blade that is actually sharper than steel, with a tip that is just the width of a few molecules.If you find an arrowhead or sharp rock near a old tribal ground, you found some flint.

, Flint often forms as nodules inside pieces of chalk or limestone.So in addition to looking for pieces of flint, look for larger rocks that may contain several pieces of flint. Bust them open and see what you find.


Look for discolorations on a piece of limestone. Usually flint or chert nodules will be a slightly darker shade than the surrounding limestone.You can break these pieces out with the use of some tools and collect the flint.
Grab an iron hammer and bust open some smaller rocks. If you notice some sparks when the hammer contacts the rock, there is likely some flint or quartz inside.

Be very cautious when stoking the fire, adding fuel or cooking over it.,
Put the fire out when you're done with it.",How to Be Careful Around a Campfire," Build about 10 feet (3.0 m) away from tents, trees, roots, overhanging boughs or dry leaves, and other flammable items. This is especially important if if there's no fire ring available.


Sweep away loose twigs, sticks, leaves or roots.
Underground roots can catch on fire in dry conditions. Do not place a fire near these.;
, Dig it a few inches into the ground (a fire pit) to contain the fire.

, Put rocks around the pit to create a barrier between the fire and everything else.


Don't use rocks saturated with water. When they heat up, the steam pressure created can cause the rocks to explode and fracture. Use dry rocks.

, This makes it a lot easier to keep under control.

, Do not add anything dangerous to the flames, such as pressurized cans or glass.


Never use flammable liquid or fuel to start a fire. Keep gas canisters/bottles and fuel cans well away from the campfire zone.

,, Have the tools ready to put out any escaped fire if necessary.


Prepare a bucket of water. Keep it near the fire. In some cases, you might even consider having a bucket of water beside each tent.
Keep a fire extinguisher nearby. Not only is it safe, but if you have children with friends, then parents will be reassured that their child is safe.

, Make sure all children are kept away from the fire's edge. If they are close to it, make sure they have adult supervision.


Never leave children, pets or the fire unattended when camping.

, Put chairs in a circle far enough from the fire where you can feel heat, but it is not threatening to catch on fire.

, Stay alert for sparks and for coals that roll out.


Handle hot cooking gear with oven mitts or gloves. For example, hot handles from cast iron pots etc. and food wrapped in aluminum foil should not be touched with bare hands while over the fire or for a while after it has been removed.
Sticks or tongs can be used to wedge cooked things out of the fire.

, Be sure to extinguish every last ember properly.


Allow the fire to burn to ash.
Pour water over all the ash, as much as is needed to completely smother it. When the hissing sound stops, you can stop adding water.
Stir with a shovel, breaking up any branches or twigs left.
It should all be wet and cold to the touch. Be careful testing!


A fire should be extinguished before the last person goes to bed at night.

Notice the color of the rock.,
Look for flint in various shapes.,
Look for a glossy surface on the rock.,
Test the hardness of the stone.,
Take out a striker made of carbon steel and strike it against the stone.",How to Identify Flint2," Flint will likely appear black or dark gray. This is the only physical difference between flint and chert.Chert doesn't have a particular identifying color, but it usually appears in a combination of a few different shades depending on the other minerals that are present. Shades of maroon, tan, yellow, white or occasionally a deep blue are all common among types of chert. Sometimes these colors may form bands along the surface.


Other types of quartz to learn to identify that can also be used in place of flint could be carnelian, agate, bloodstone, jade and chalcedony.Surrounding rocks can impact the appearance of flints. When flints are buried in chalk, a white patina or film can form over the flint., Flint can be found in natural occurring nodules or as a fragment that has been worked into a shape.


Flint nodules can appear in various smooth, rounded shapes embedded in chalk or limestone. When you find flint that has been embedded in a chalk bed, it is common to find an imprint of shells cast into the surface.Look for rocks that have been split like broken glass. Flint fractures differently from many crystals. When the pieces come apart the tend to look like glass shards, with curves and sharper edges.In addition to looking for natural nodules of flint, be sure to look for flint that has been worked into a shape. You can control the way flint splits easier than other rocks, which is another reason why people used to used flint to shape tools and weapons. Sometimes flint may have edges that seem to have been chipped away or have a point, indicating they have been used as a tool.

, Flint often displays a natural, glassy luster. If it was just broken, the luster may seem dull and somewhat waxy to the touch. You can usually rub away or sand this cortex to reveal more of the surface luster.

, If you have a glass bottle, try to scratch it with the sharp edge of the flint. If the rock is strong enough to scratch glass, it is as hard as flint.


Be careful when striking glass with a rock. Using gloves to protect your hands is a good idea.

, If sparks fly after several attempts, then you might have a piece of flint.


The ""sparks"" produced are actually just the tiny fragments of iron breaking off the iron surface. The sudden exposure to air generates a rapid oxidization where the fragment can not dissipate the heat as fast as it generates it. The spark is only a glowing piece of freshly exposed iron.If the rock doesn't have a very sharp edge, you will want to create one to test for sparks. To check the inside of a rock use a larger rock as a hammer to flake of pieces from the thinnest end of the rock.
When striking your flint of metal, make sure the stone is dry, as a damp stone may not produce sparks.
Other rocks, such as quartz, that have a hardness of seven on the Mohs Scale of Hardness will create sparks when struck against a carbon metal. If you are only looking for a rock which you can use to create sparks and start a fire, try learning what other rock types will also do the job.

Bring tinder.,
Gather kindling.,
Collect firewood.,
Pack a firestarter.",How to Build a Campfire1," To start an effective campfire, you must start with tinder, which are the smallest fire-starting materials and burn the easiest. The tinder must be dry, so it’s best to bring tinder with you from home instead of looking for it while camping. You can use a variety of household items as tinder, such as:Wood shavings
Wadded newspaper
Cardboard
Wax
Dryer lint
Commercial fire sticks;
, To keep your fire burning, you’ll need to add some more substantial material to the tinder. Kindling is larger than tinder materials, but not so large that it will smother the fire’s flames. Look around your campground for small twigs and branches to use as kindling.Choose twigs and branches with a diameter between ⅛- and ½-inch, or approximately the width of a pencil.
Just as with tinder, it’s important that your kindling materials are dry. If there are any damp areas on the twigs and branches, use a pocket knife to carefully whittle them off.

, For your campfire to really maintain its flames, you must add larger pieces of wood. These materials, usually known as firewood or fuelwood, can be anywhere from 1- to 5-inches in diameter, so you can use complete logs or split larger pieces of wood into smaller chunks.You shouldn’t break branches off trees to use as firewood or you’ll ruin the trees at your campsite. Instead, look for pieces that have already fallen off.
Look for firewood that bends or snaps easily. That way, you’ll know it’s dry enough to burn in the fire.
You don’t want to use firewood that’s too large because it will take much longer to start burning.
If you’re not sure whether wood is the right size, compare it to your wrist or forearm -- they should be about the same size.

, Once you have the proper materials to build your fire, you’ll need something to light it. Make sure to include some type of firestarter in your camping gear, so you can easily start your fire. Regular matches work well to start a fire, but you may prefer to use a lighter.You can also use a ferro-flint rod as a firestarter when camping. Also known as a flint spark lighter, it generates a spark that helps ignite your fire materials."

Select the area to build the camp fire in.,
Prepare the area:


Clear the area of debris and other flammable material.,
Gather firewood.",How to Build a Teepee Camp Fire1,"


Criteria include: No low overhanging tree branches, these could catch fire if the flames leap, and is the Campfire far enough from the tents so that the tents won’t melt;
,
Ring the Campfire area with rocks and dig a depression into the ground to help contain the fire and shelter it from wind
Pile the excess dirt near the fire and Have a bucket of water nearby to be used to put out the fire.

,


In order to begin building the Campfire, material must be gathered that will be burned in the Campfire.
The Camping Guide from LoveTheOutdoors.com classifies the three types of wood that will be needed to build a successful campfire:

tinder,
kindling,
fuel.


Use material that is already on the ground and is dry, using fresh cut or wet wood will make the fire smokier and is more difficult to catch fire. Pile the firewood a couple yards away from the fire so that it doesn’t catch fire

"
"
Make sure campfires are permitted.,
Choose a spot for the fire.,
Clear and dig out the spot.",How to Build a Campfire2," Before you begin building a fire, it’s important to verify that fires are allowed in the area. Look around your campsite for posted signs, which will usually inform you if fires aren’t permitted. You can also ask a ranger or the campsite’s host if fires are allowed.Don’t assume that a campfire is permitted just because there’s a fire ring at your campsite. It may be intended for use with a camping stove but not an open flame.
In some cases, there may be fire restrictions in place, which limit the types of fires that you are permitted to light. Make sure you understand what materials you’re allowed to use for your fire.
Campfires may not be permitted at certain altitudes, in areas that are experiencing droughts and are extremely dry, or at times when the winds are very strong.

, Some campsites have specific fire rings designed for building a fire. However, if you’re camping in an area that doesn’t have a fire ring, it’s important to choose the right spot for the fire. Make sure that the site is at least 15-feet from tents, shrubs, trees, and any other flammable objects.If your campsite has a fire ring, there may be ashes in it from a previous fire. Push them to the outside of the ring to make room for your fire. If the ashes are completely cold, you can also place them in a plastic bag so can dispose of them properly later.
Make sure the spot that you choose is shielded from wind gusts, which can not only make it more difficult to light but can help spread the fire if the flames get too large.

, It’s best to build a campfire on bare dirt, so you may need to clear the spot you’ve chosen. Remove any dead grass, leaves, or other vegetation to create an 8- to 10-foot area of bare soil for the fire. Next, dig down into the dirt for several inches to create a pit to contain the fire.Keep the removed dirt close to the fire. You can use it to help smother the flames in case of an emergency.
You can place the removed dirt in a mounded ring around your fire pit to serve as a firewall. Setting large rocks around the pit can also help insulate the fire.

"
"
Place tinder in the center of the fire pit.,
Create a teepee with kindling and firewood.,
Light the tinder.,
Add kindling and firewood as needed.",How to Build a Campfire3," As with most campfires, a teepee fire starts with a foundation of tinder. Gather up your tinder materials and place them in a bundle in the center of the fire location.To make it easier to bundle the tinder, you may want to lay it on top of a piece of dry tree bark.

, Once your tinder material is in place in the center, gather your kindling and use approximately five or six pieces to create a cone-like teepee shape around the tinder. Next, add a layer of firewood to create a larger teepee around the first.Stick the smaller twigs and branches into the ground to help secure the teepee.
Start with smaller pieces of kindling and move on to larger pieces for a second layer as you build the structure.
Make sure to leave an opening in the teepee so you can light the fire when you’re ready. Place the opening on the side of the teepee where the wind is blowing, so the fire will get the air needed to maintain it.
Leave spaces between the pieces of wood as you place them to help air circulate through the fire as well.
Keep a reserve pile of kindling and firewood on hand after building the teepee. You may need it later to feed the fire.

, With the teepee structure in place, it’s time to light the fire. Place a match or lighter under the tinder to ignite it. The teepee structure helps encourage the flames to move upward, so the kindling should catch fire first, followed by the firewood.If the flames don’t move from the tinder to the kindling and firewood, you may need to relight the tinder to get the fire started.

, As the fire burns, the teepee structure will eventually collapse, and help feed the fire for some time. However, the flames may start to die down after a while. At that point, throw some kindling and firewood from your reserve pile onto the fire to maintain it.A teepee fire is ideal for cooking because it burns steadily for a shorter period of time.

Place a piece of kindling in the ground with tinder beneath it.,
Add smaller pieces of kindling.,
Light the tinder.,
Add more kindling and firewood.",How to Build a Campfire4," Start preparing your fire by setting a long piece of kindling in the dirt at a 30 degree angle in your fire pit. Next, gather your tinder material into a bundle, and place it beneath the lean-to kindling.While kindling usually consists of thin sticks, you can use a small or medium-size log as the lean-to.
Make sure that the end of the kindling that you place in the ground is pointing into the wind.

, Once the lean-to and tinder are ready, start placing additional pieces of kindling in your fire set-up. Choose smaller pieces of kindling than the stick serving as the lean-to, and set them against the tinder bundle and lean-to.As you lay the kindling around the lean-to and tinder, you’ll create a tent-like shape.
Once you have a first layer of kindling arranged around the lean-to and tinder, find larger pieces and place a second layer on top.

, After you’re finished building the lean-to structure, it’s time to light the fire. Use matches or a lighter to ignite the tinder. As it starts to burn, the kindling will eventually catch fire too, and create larger flames., Once the kindling starts to burn, you can add more pieces to feed the fire. If it isn’t as large as you’d like, you can throw some firewood on the fire to help it grow. Start with one piece, and only add more when you’re sure that the fire hasn’t grown large enough.A lean-to fire is good for cooking because it doesn’t burn too long but remains steady while it is lit.

Create a small kindling teepee over the tinder.,
Place four pieces of firewood around the teepee.,
Continue laying firewood to build a cabin.,
Top with the lightest kindling and light.",How to Build a Campfire5," To start a log cabin fire, you’ll need to create a set-up similar to a teepee fire. Center your tinder in the fire pit, and use kindling to create a teepee shape around it. Make sure to start with smaller pieces of kindling and then add a second layer of larger kindling.Your teepee lay doesn’t have to be as large as it would if you were planning a teepee fire. Two layers of kindling are usually enough.

, Collect four pieces of firewood to set around the teepee. Take the two largest pieces and place them on opposite sides of the teepee. Next, set the two smaller pieces on the other sides to form a square with the wood. Make sure that the smaller pieces rest over the two larger pieces.Be sure to leave an opening on the side of the structure that is upwind, so you can reach the tinder when it’s time to light the fire.

, Over the four pieces of wood that form the base, lay smaller and shorter pieces of firewood in the same pattern. The goal is to create a cabin-like structure around the original teepee.The process of laying the wood around the teepee is similar to building with the Lincoln Log toys that you may remember from your childhood.

, Once you’ve built up the cabin for the fire, place some of your lightest kindling on top to close off the structure. Use a match or lighter to light the tinder inside the cabin.For best results, light the tinder from several sides.
Until the external walls of the cabin catch fire, continue to add kindling to the inside in order to feed the internal fire.
A log cabin lay typically offers up a longer-lasting fire, so it's an ideal choice if you need warmth for an extended period.

Build the teepee camp fire.,
Light the fire.,
Put out the fire.",How to Build a Teepee Camp Fire2," Now the Campfire is ready to be built. The key to a successful Campfire is layers.


Place your campfire Tepee from campfiretepee.com in your fire pit.
Loosely place lots of tinder around the middle of the Campfire tepee.
Place a little kindling around the tinder.
Lean 3 pieces of fuel wood against your campfire tepee, one at 12 o clock, one at 4 o clock, and one at 8 o clock.

,


Light the tinder first, and keep feeding the fire tinder until the kindling catches fire.
Once the kindling catches fire, continue feeding the fire kindling until the fuel catches fire.
Once the fuel catches fire, continue feeding the fire fuel wood until it is time to put the fire out.

, First deconstruct it by removing the embers from each other with a stick. Then douse the fire with water, and stir the ashes with a stick. Continue dousing and stirring until the fire is out. Finally cover the stirred ashes with dirt.

"
"
Start putting it out early.,
Sprinkle water over the fire.,
Stir the embers.,
Test the heat with your hand.,
Remove the ashes.",How to Build a Campfire6," You’re responsible for putting out any campfire that you start, and the process often takes longer than you think it will. To prevent the possibility of leaving any smoldering ashes behind, plan ahead to give yourself enough time to do the job right. Set aside at least 20 minutes to put out the fire, so you can be certain to kill it completely.You should never leave a fire unattended, so you need to put yours out when you go to sleep at night. Make sure to give yourself about a half hour to put out the fire before you plan to go to bed.

, While you may be tempted to throw an entire bucket of water on the flames to put them out quickly, that’s not the best way to extinguish a campfire. Instead, start slowly sprinkling water over the fire, using only as much as you need to put out the fire’s embers.Pouring water on your fire is a bad idea because it will flood the fire pit, making it unusable when you or someone else wants to light a fire later.

, As you sprinkle water over the fire, you want to ensure that it reaches as much of the embers as possible. To accomplish this, use a shovel or stick to stir the ashes and embers as you douse them with water. Make sure to bring up embers from the bottom of the pile so you don’t leave any smouldering underneath.You’ll know that you’re done sprinkling water and stirring the embers when you no longer see steam or hear hissing sounds.

, To be certain that the fire is out, you’ll want to make sure that it's no longer giving off heat. Place your hand, palm-side up, over the ashes. If you don’t feel any heat, the fire is out. If you still feel any heat, the fire isn’t out and you shouldn’t leave. Continue to add water and stir the ashes until you no longer feel any heat.Repeat the hand test as many times as needed to be certain that the fire is cold. You’re better off safe than sorry.

, Once the fire is out and cold, you should remove the ashes from the fire pit or ring so the next camper doesn’t have to deal with getting rid of them. Use your shovel or hand to scoop up the ashes and place them in a plastic bag for disposal.As you walk away from your campsite, start spreading the ashes around on the ground to dispose of them.

Learn how to make tinder for a fire and have your tinder nest ready.,
Gather dry wood.",How to Make Fire Without Matches or a Lighter1," For all of the methods below, you will need a tinder nest to nurture the sparks and/or embers you create into a flame.;
, In order to create friction and maintain a flame, you will need to use dry wood, as best as you can get.


Dry wood hiding places. If the area is damp, you may have to check the interior of logs, under ledges, and other places that are protected from wetness.
Know your trees. Not all wood ignites equally. Depending on your locality, some particular trees start fires more readily. For instance, paper birch yields paper-like bark that, even when wet, often makes an excellent tinder.
Look beyond wood. Although fire-building is usually taught in the spirit of building a fire in the wilderness, you may have to adapt. In an urban situation there may be no trees, so you may have to look at things like old books, wooden pallets, furniture, and the like to get a fire started.

Make a tinder nest out of any dry plant material that easily catches fire.,
Find a battery and locate the battery terminals.,
Take your steel wool and rub it on the battery terminals.,
Continue to create friction by rubbing the steel wool on the batteries.,
Blow gently on the steel wool as it starts to glow.,
Once the steel wool is glowing brightly, transfer the steel wool to your tinder nest quickly, continuing to blow lightly on the nest until the tinder ignites, creating a flame.

,
Add increasingly larger pieces of dry wood to build your fire once the tinder nest has ignited into a flame and enjoy your fire!

",How to Make Fire Without Matches or a Lighter2," You can use dry grass, leaves, small sticks, and bark. This nest will be used to create a flame out of the spark you create with the battery and steel wool.

, The terminals are the two circular receiving prongs located on the top of the battery.


Any battery voltage will work, but 9-volt batteries will ignite the quickest.

, The finer the steel wool, the better for this process.

, This process works by creating a current through the tiny steel wires that then heat up and ignite.


Another way to do this is to take a 9-volt battery and a metal paperclip and rub the paperclip on both battery terminals at the same time to create sparks. This is similar to how the wires in light bulbs and toasters ovens operate.

, This helps nurture the flame and encourages it to spread.

Take your flint rock (a rock that emits sparks) and hold it between your thumb and forefinger.,
Grab a piece of char cloth between your thumb and the flint.,
Take the back of a steel striker or the back of a knife blade (depending on which you have handy) and quickly scrape the steel against the flint.,
Catch the sparks with your char cloth and continue the process until the cloth glows like an ember.,
Transfer the glowing char cloth to your tinder nest and gently blow on it to induce a flame.

,
Begin to add increasingly larger pieces of wood to grow your flame into a fire.

",How to Make Fire Without Matches or a Lighter3,", Allow about two or three inches of flint to extend past your grasp.

, Char cloths are small squares of cloth that have been turned into easily combustible charcoal pieces. If you do not have any char cloth on hand, you can also use lightweight tree fungus.

, Continue to strike until sparks begin to form.

, Char cloths are specially designed to hold a glow without catching fire.

Build your fire.",How to Start a Fire with Sticks," There are a few different methods for starting a fire with sticks, but whichever method you try you are going to try, begin by gathering together the tinder and firewood that you will be burning. For tinder, anything that is dry, fibrous, and will take a spark or catch and ignite should do. Pocket lint, feather down, dried mosses, and shredded plant fibers such as cedar bark are all good examples.


You should try to get a tinder bundle that is very dry and fine.The tinder bundle is the first thing that you will burn.;
, You will also need to gather together the kindling, which you will add to the tinder once you have the beginnings of your fire. Gather several handfuls of kindling, typically tiny pieces of wood in various sizes. You want some that are as thin as or thinner than a toothpick but longer; several handfuls of wood about the thickness and length of a pencil; and lots of wood up to about the thickness of your arm.Avoid using wood that was on the ground since it may be damp. Instead, look for snags (dead branches that have fallen off trees but get caught in lower branches or on bushes).
It is possible to snap dead branches from trees, but only take those that immediately snap free. Otherwise, they may not in fact be dead.
If a branch bends without breaking, it's still alive or not dry enough. Avoid green wood since most won't burn well.

, Once your fire is up and running you will need to add some larger pieces of firewood to keep it fueled. It’s a good idea to get yourself a large stack of wood ready to use before you try to light the fire. This wood should be larger than the kindling, and only added once your fire is established.


This wood must be as dry as possible. Dead trees are often a good source of dry firewood.When you collect the wood, try to avoid putting it directly onto the ground if it is wet.

, Whichever method you use to get your spark, you will need to make a small nest with your tinder. This is also known as a tinder bundle. Once you have a spark or some coals, you will transfer these to the nest to get the first flames. Bunch together a small ball of your tinder, around the size of a cotton ball, with small fibers, such as cattail plant at the center. You can use some slightly thicker fiber on the outside, such as dry leaves, to shelter the nest. Make sure you make a hole or indent with your thumbs for the coal.


Try to fashion the tinder bundle into a shape similar to a birds nest.
You can use a strip of bark wrapped around the bundle to hold it together., Before you start to work on getting your spark or coals, you can build up some of your firewood into a teepee shape. Arranging a cone of your fuel, with lots of timber in the middle, and larger sticks around the sides, can help your fire to establish and grow. Don’t overload the teepee, and remember to leave plenty of space so that air can pass through it and feed the flame.







, If you are using either the hand drill or the bow drill method, you will need to first prepare your fireboard. This is what you will press the drill against to create the friction that will hopefully start your fire. The fire board and the drill both need to be made from light, dry, non-resinous wood.









The best wood for this won't have any sap and will be light and soft enough to easily dent with your thumbnail without gouging.
Shape whatever wood you choose into a piece about an inch thick, 2-4 inches (5-10 cm) across and at least 12 inches (31 cm) long., Once you have your fireboard you will need make your drill. Your drill should be made of harder wood than your fireboard. Poplar and Maple are good woods for this. Try to find the straightest piece of wood possible, and carve it down to a length of around 8 inches and a diameter of about 1.5 inches.









Carve one end of the stick into a tapered point, like the end of a pencil.
Carve the other end into a blunt point., If you are trying the bow drill method, now is the time to make your bow. Use slightly flexible wood for this, as you'll be exerting a lot of pressure on the bow and dead wood is more likely to break than similarly sized green wood. Green or dead wood can, however, both work as a bow.Make a bow that is approximately the length of your arm, and has a diameter of one or two inches. Use as thin a piece of wood as you can so the bow will be as light as possible.
A lighter bow is easier to control and takes less strength to push back and forth. However, it has to be stiff enough to not bend when you're using it., Use a shoelace, drawstring, small rope or whatever cordage you can find for the bowstring. Natural materials such as dogbane and nettle were traditionally used to make bowstrings. Cut a length that is around six feet long, and tie one end of the cordage tightly to one end of the bow.









Tie the other end of the string on with a looser an adjustable knot so that you can alter the length and tension of the string., It's important to keep the string tight so that it doesn't slip on the drill. However, if it's too tight, it will make the drill pop out of the socket or the fire-board. There are a number of ways to deal with the string adjustment.









Get the string almost tight enough, hold it at the very end of the bow and then squeeze the string up against the bow as you start to saw back and forth, if needed.
Even if you get the string just right at first, it will often loosen up as you're sawing back and forth, so this is a good technique to master. You may need to work your hand up the bow to get the string tight enough as you go.
To keep the cord firm, you might have to loop it around your finger(s) or adjust it by tying a tighter knot.
Another way to keep it tight is to put another stick (preferably thick, as this method can snap smaller sticks) in another loop, near the end.
Twirl it around and around until you reach the desired tightness and then 'lock' it against the bow. If it keeps slipping, hold that end in your hand.

, The socket, sometimes referred to as the handhold, is the thing you will use to exert extra downwards pressure on the drill, Typically it is a small object with a hole or notch in that you place on the top of drill and push down on. Your socket can be made of bone, wood or rock.









Look for a rock with a smooth dimple in it. Ideally, the rock should be about fist sized. It should fit easily in your hand but not be too small or it can heat up very quickly. The ideal rock has a deep dimple with smooth sides.If you can't find a rock, the easiest socket to make is wood. It should be small enough for you to comfortably hold in your hand, but big enough that your fingers don't wrap all the way around it and touch the drill.
It is best to make the socket out of hardwood if possible, or use a knot in softwood as a naturally lubricated socket. Use the tip of a knife or sharp rock to drill a hole no more than halfway into the wood.
You can also improvise a socket from many other materials. Look for things that will keep the narrow end of the drill stable, but still allow it turn easily. Of course, other things can be used as sockets.
Lubricating the socket with lip balm or resin is a good practice.

, If you have already drilled a hole in your fireboard before you set off into the wilderness, you won’t need to do this step. If, however, you are making your fireboard from scratch, you will need to the make the hole which you will then insert the drill into.









Carve a small hole with your knife, about an inch from the edge of the board. The hole should be the width of your drill and about a quarter of an inch deep.
When you push down on the drill if should be difficult to turn it. You should feel strong friction., Once you have carved a small hole, you can use your drill to make this into a better shape to create friction and fire. You can do this by drilling into the hole and burning it with friction. Once you have made this hole, you will be able to re-use it in the future when you want to start a fire with sticks. Note that the following steps are written from the perspective of a right-handed person or ""rightie""; it would be the reverse for ""lefties"".


Put the fireboard on the ground.
Put your left foot on the fireboard about one inch to the left of the crater. The arch of your foot (not the ball or the heel) should be over the fireboard. Make sure the ground is pretty flat or bed the fireboard into the ground. You don't want it to wiggle or rock much, if at all.
Kneel on your right knee. Make sure that your right knee is far enough behind your left foot that you make all 90 degree angles. (More about that later.)
Hold the bow in your right hand and the drill in your left.
Put the drill on top of the string with the pencil-sharp end pointing right, and twist it into the bow. You can loosen the string a bit if it's too hard to do, but the string must not slip once wrapped around the drill.
Put the blunt end of the drill on the crater. Put the socket on the drill.
Grab as close to the end of the bow as you can. Put some downward pressure on the socket and start to pull back and forth on the bow. It's a delicate balance between putting too much and not enough pressure on the drill, and having the bow string too tight and not tight enough.
Saw back and forth with the bow faster and faster, and put more and more pressure on the socket.
Eventually, you'll get some black powder and smoke around the bottom of the drill. This is a good sign! Stop and pick up the fireboard., If you are not using a bow, you still have to burn the hole into the board. You can do this by using your hands to turn the drill and create the friction in the same way that the bow does. Place the drill between your hands and run your hands backwards and forwards to spin it.









Ensure that you are keeping downwards and inwards pressure on the drill all the time.
You will find that this leads to your hands moving down the drill as you go. It’s important to keep it turning, so when your hands are near the board move them back up to the top of the drill quickly.
Keep going until you see smoke. This can be a long and arduous process, so have patience and stick with it., Use your cutting device to make a V-shaped notch that reaches from the edge of the fireboard almost to the center of the hole you just burned in the fireboard. The most important thing is to make sure that it's not so wide that when you start spinning the drill in the hole again it just slips out through the notch.


The notch should be the size of about 1/8 of a pie slice.
The narrow end of the slice should meet the center of the hole you have burned into the wood.
The wide end should face outwards away from the hole.The notch and the drill end that goes into it should both be rough, not shiny and smooth. The roughness promotes friction. If they get shiny, put a little sand in the notch.

, You need something to catch the coal that's created, keep it insulated from the cold ground and carry it from the ground to the tinder. This can be a dry leaf, sliver of wood, piece of paper or bark, among other options. Whatever it is, make sure you can pick it up without fumbling around and dropping it.


Place it directly under the notch you have cut in the fireboard before you try to make coal., Now it's time to make fire! You do everything the same way you did when you burned a hole in the fireboard. Don't forget to put your coal catcher under the chimney notch, and have your tinder bundle ready.









Start pushing and pulling on the bow, and pushing down on the socket. As you get into a rhythm, saw faster and put more pressure on the socket.
Keep the bow in the middle of the drill. If the string moves up the drill, it will create more horizontal force up near the socket and will be more likely to pop out.
The bow string should always be horizontal to the ground (if the ground is perfectly flat) and perpendicular to the drill. This ensures that every stroke of the bow is providing the maximum amount of ""output"" and as a result, lessens fatigue on your body--using a bow drill is hard work!
Eventually you'll get black powder collecting in the chimney notch. Keep going and you'll get some smoke.
When you've got a lot of smoke coming out, don’t stop. Increase the pressure and the speed of your drilling.
Look at the dust you are creating. The darker the dust the better.
If you are getting smoke from your dust pile, it is likely that you have a coal., If you are using your hands, repeat the hand drilling technique you used to burn the hole in the fireboard. Using your hands rather than a bow is generally slower and harder work, but you can get a coal if you stick with it. Move your hands backwards and forwards rapidly across the drill, and don’t let up the downwards pressure onto the fireboard.









Try to keep your hands towards the top of the drill by moving them in a half circle or arc motion.
The lowest point of the arc should be the point where they run against the drill., Once you have a coal, carefully remove the drill and lift away the fire board, using a twig to hold the new ember down if it gets stuck in the notch. Use one hand to gently fan air over the coal, making it bigger and more solid. Don't blow on it unless you blow very gently, as you might knock it off the coal catcher.









If the ground's wet, it'll put the coal out. You might also put it out if you have to pick it up off the ground.
Once you're sure the coal isn't going to go out, transfer it to your tinder and give it a gentle blow.

, Begin blowing softly through the bundle while gently squeezing the tinder around the coal. As more tinder catches, you might have to turn and/or reshape it to keep the ember spreading into more and more of the tinder.Blowing will provide more oxygen to stoke the fire and transfer the energy from the coal to the tinder bundle., Continue blowing and gently squeezing with the tinder bundle until you get actual flames. Put it on the ground where you want your fire. Keep blowing if you need to keep the flames going. Add the toothpick size sticks on top of the bundle, then the pencil sized sticks, followed by increasingly bigger items until you have your campfire.


If you have prepared a teepee-type fire, put the burning tinder bundle into the center.
Keep blowing slowly and steadily to help spread the fire.

How to Make Fire Without Matches or a Lighter;
, Tinder catches the initial spark from the ignition source and transfers it to the kindling. If the kindling is damp or wet, the tinder must burn long enough to dry out the kindling.


You can turn dry sticks and pieces of bark into powdery tinder with a knife.
Other sources of tinder include:

dead dry plants and grasses
wax
lint
birch bark
charcloth
moss
wood shavings
paper
pine pitch
dry needles from coniferous trees
fire sticks
dry leaves
fire starters



, Kindling needs a large surface to volume ratio (about 1/8"" to 1/2"" diameter) and more bulk than tinder so it can ignite easily, produce sustained concentrated heat and flame, and light the main fuel source.


Good sources: dry twigs and wood pieces, cardboard, large pieces of wood cut into small pieces, and fuzz sticks (sticks with shavings cut into them, but still attached).
If you need to split small pieces of wood into smaller pieces for kindling, try these methods:

Hold the wood you want to split parallel to the axe, with the top of the stick touching the axe blade. Both your hands are near the bottom of the axe handle: one holding the ax, and the other holding the stick. With the stick touching the axe blade where you want it to split, swing both the stick and the axe together to hit the chopping block. When the axe splits the stick, give it a twist to finish splitting the stick into two pieces.
To split a small piece of wood, hold the stick upright, either by sticking into the ground or holding it with your feet. Take a rock a little bigger than your fist, and smack the end of the stick with the rock until a crack has been created. Peel the layers back with your fingers to split the wood into smaller pieces.



, Good fuels for sustained burning include dry wood that is 1"" to 5"" (2.5 cm to 12.5 cm) in diameter, twisted dry grasses, peat, dried animal dung and coal. Gather more fuel than you think you'll need, especially if you're going to sleep by the fire.









Green or wet fuel can be used, but only once the fire is established because it will burn more slowly than dry fuel.
Softwoods/conifers/evergreens have leaves in the shape of needles. They burn quickly and very hot, and they also contain flammable resins which burn hotter and help with starting a fire. Because of this, they're often used for kindling as well, since they're easier to ignite than hardwoods. You will know if you are using a wood with resin because it crackles and pops while burning.
Hardwoods have broad flat leaves and they don't catch fire as easily as softwoods. Once they do, however, they burn for a longer period of time and give off more heat. It may be necessary to know How to Split Hardwood Firewood or How to Split Gnarly Firewood

You can also Make Logs from Newspapers.

, Build a ring of rocks or dig a fire pit that's several inches deep using a shovel or hand trowel. Constructing a ring of stones will insulate the fire. Building a firewall with logs or rocks will reflect the fire's heat, especially if you'll only be on one side of the fire (because otherwise the heat sent off in the other direction is wasted).









If the ground is wet or covered with snow, build a platform out of green logs and cover them with a layer of earth or stones.

, You want your kindling close enough to ignite but spaced enough for good air circulation.









Place your tinder on the pile of kindling. Light the fire with your ignition source and gradually add more kindling.
Slowly blow air on the igniting fire to build heat and intensity.

, The arrangement you choose will determine the fire's longevity, how fast it burns, and how long your wood lasts.










Build a tepee. Arrange the tinder and a few sticks of kindling in the shape of a cone, and light them at the center. The outside logs will fall inward and feed the fire. This is the most effective of all fire arrangements.

Since a flame is hottest at the tip of the fire (where the oxygen combusts into fire to create carbon dioxide) the top of the teepee is where the most intense heat will be, so if a stick is thicker at one end, be sure to place the thicker end at the top of the tepee.
Because of the tepee arrangement, wet wood and green wood will burn well. However, since very intense heat is generated by the arrangement, the fire burns through wood rather quickly.Construct a log cabin. Stack layers in alternating directions to form 4 walls in the shape of a square. Leave enough room for a tepee structure in the center, and make sure that air can circulate between the logs in your ""cabin"" walls.

The ""chimney effect"" will suck air in through the bottom and let it exit through top as strong flame. If the fire seems like its not getting enough oxygen, dig small holes under the walls to allow for better air flow, or blow on the fire to reach optimal burning temperature.
This arrangement is best for cooking food, because the square shape creates uniform heat. You can place food on top of the stack for a while if you use larger, green pieces of wood at the top.



Erect a pyramid. Place 2 small logs or branches on the ground so that they're parallel to each other. Then, put a solid layer of small logs or branches on top of them in a perpendicular direction.

Add 3 or 4 more layers, each time alternating the direction, and each layer being smaller than the one before.
Light the top of the pyramid on fire, and the flame will naturally travel down toward the base.



Build a lean-to. Push a green stick into the ground at a 30-degree angle with its tip pointing in the direction of the wind. Put tinder underneath and lean sticks of kindling against the main stick. Light the tinder and add more kindling as needed.

Dig a cross ditch. Scratch a cross in the ground that's 12"" (30 cm) in diameter. Make it 3"" (7.5 cm) deep, and place a big wad of tinder in the middle. Build a pyramid out of kindling over the tinder. The ditch will allow air to flow through and feed the fire.

Create a star. With this arrangement, you can push the logs inward to increase heat, and pull them out to decrease heat. This method is particularly helpful if you're trying to conserve fuel.,"

, The patterns are ever changing and delight the eye and mind. Watching flames can be meditative.

, Look at and enjoy the sparks flying into the air.

, Do not inhale smoke that you can see; you can still smell it from a little further away, and it's not strong enough to make you cough.

,,,, Dried pine cones that are still closed will open when placed in a hot fire. They also burn with a bright flame, due to the oils in them.

Hunt in shallow water.,
Follow the tide.,
Search tide pools for seaweed.,
Fish in the mid- to late summer.,
Fish at night.",How to Catch Prawns1," Prawns hatch in shallow coastal waters. They also tend to stay in large, shallow bodies of water with tide pools or bays. Fish in these waters instead of deep bodies of water.;
, Veterans always fish for prawns when the tide runs out. This is because prawns will naturally come up toward the surface of the water as it becomes shallower.This makes it easy to skim them out of the water with a hand-held net or with a two-person trawler net.

, Plant material makes up a good part of a prawn’s diet.If you see a tide pool with green seaweed, you’ll have a better chance of finding a prawn eating and hiding in it. However, you should be prepared for a lot of hunching over. Prawns tend to hide in awkward spots.

, July to September is the best time for prawning. This is when the water reaches its warmest temperatures.It is also when many species of prawn have completed the mating season and are more likely to be closer to the shore., Many species of prawns are sensitive to light, so fishing at night is one of the best ways to fish for them. Try to plan fishing trips on evenings when the moon is full. This will maximize the light reflected on the water's surface.


Use a flashlight to help you see the prawns’ eyes. Shine it in an arc over the surface of the water.

Again, make a tinder nest.,
Find an object to use as a socket such as a stone or a heavy piece of wood.,
Find a long, flexible piece of wood about the length of your arm.,
Make the string of the bow using any strong, abrasive material that can withstand a lot of friction.,
Tie the string as tight as possible to each end of the bow handle.,
Find a piece of wood to use as the base of your hand drill, otherwise known as a fire board, and cut a small V-shaped notch into the center using a knife or other sharp object.

,
Place your tinder nest underneath the V-shaped notch.,
Loop the bow string around your spindle stick one time.,
Whittle one end of the spindle into a point, to reduce friction in the socket.,
Place one end of the spindle in the V-shaped notch in your fire board and then stack the socket on the top end of the spindle.,
Begin sawing the bow quickly back and forth, holding the curved, wooden part of the bow in your dominant hand.,
Continue to saw back and forth until you create an ember where the spindle meets the fire board.,
Gather the ember you created onto a piece of scrap wood and drop it into your tinder nest.,
Blow on your tinder nest as you gradually add increasingly larger pieces of dry wood to create a fire.

",How to Make Fire Without Matches or a Lighter6," Use any dry plant material you can gather.

, The socket will be used to put pressure on the spindle.

, It is best if this piece of wood has a slight curve in it. This will serve as the handle of your bow.

, You might want to use a shoelace, a thin rope or string, paracord, or a strip of rawhide.

, If there are not already natural notches in the bow wood to anchor the string, whittle small, straight notches into the wood in order to act as a groove for the string.

,, You want to have the tinder right next to base of the spindle so that you can easily create flames.

, Make sure you do so in the middle of the bow string to create enough space to roll the string back and forth.

, Once a char starts on this end, avoid cutting it off to make the spindle last longer.

, Hold the socket with your non-dominant hand.

, This will cause the spindle to spin (hence the name ""spindle"") and create heat at the base of the fire board.

, Make sure your tinder nest is close by.

, You may just be able to slide the ember off of the fire board into your tinder nest.

Choose your boat.,
Get in the water.,
Work with a partner.,
Use a sounder.",How to Catch Prawns2," Make sure your boat has enough space for a cooler to store freshly caught prawns. A row boat without a motor works best, as it won’t create noise and scare the prawns away. If you do use a boat with a motor, turn the motor off as you approach the prawns’ habitat.

, After you steer the boat to your desired location, put on your wading boots and climb overboard. When you wade, you can walk through shallow waters where prawns are plentiful and follow them as they move. Return to the boat to store your prawns in a cooler to keep them fresh.

, Fishing for prawns will be easier if you work as a team with one or two other fishers. One of you can be responsible for the net while the other steers the boat or aims the flashlight.

, A sounder is a sonar device that can help you find fish. To tell prawns apart from fish, look for a mass of objects coming from the bottom of the water. It should look like a cloud.You can buy high-tech sounders at marine and fishing supply stores for under $100.

"
"
Choose your net.,
Move the water.,
Use a metal spoon.,
Bring the hand-held net back up quickly.,
Spread commercial nets out.,
Check for bycatch.",How to Catch Prawns3," Fishing supply stores usually sell nets in a hand-held variety, similar to a butterfly net, and in a larger commercial varieties adapted for trawlers. Choose which one is right for your prawning needs.

, Create motion in the water around you. Prawns naturally swim with the tide, so your motion will stimulate them to move with the water and come up off the bottom of the bay or tide pool.

, Position your hand-held net behind prawns. Place the spoon in front of them. By instinct, they’ll back away from the shiny object. As they swim backward, they’ll end up in your net., Prawns won’t stay in the net for long if you keep it in the water. As soon as you feel the prawns enter the net, sweep it up with a quick upward forearm movement. Angle the net pointed-side-down to keep the prawns from escaping.

, Do this slowly and behind the school of prawns before disturbing the water in front of them. Make sure there is a fisher with the net ready to gather it up around the prawns when they swim into it with the movement of the water.

, Nets sweep up every solid form in their paths. As soon as you make your catch, inspect the net for animals that aren’t prawns. Even if you know they’re not endangered, toss them back in the water. If you find plastic, metal, or other refuse, toss them in a nearby recycling bin or trashcan.

"
"
Choose your trap.,
Buy a weighted line.,
Use a buoy.,
Connect your gear.,
Attach bait.,
Lower the trap into the water.,
Retrieve the trap.",How to Catch Prawns4," Fishing supply stores usually sell traps under the name “shrimp traps,” but they can be used for prawning. They are available in a variety of sizes. Determine which size fits your needs. A modest sized trap about ½ inch by one inch will usually do the trick.


Double check with your local authorities on limits to trap sizes before making your purchase.

, You’ll need this to lower the trap in the water. Weighted lines prevent the trap from floating and endangering marine life and boats. Fishing supply stores sell these in a variety of lengths. Purchase a line that’s about 25 percent longer than the depth you want to lower your trap to., You’ll need a regulation fishing buoy to spot the location of your trap. Don’t use plastic bottles from home, as they’re too light to accurately mark where your trap is. Mark your buoy with a unique color, initials, or serial number to tell it apart from other fishers’ buoys.

, Attach one end of the fishing line to the trap. Connect the other end of the line to the buoy. If you plan to set your trap far from your boat or land-based location, attach a polypropylene rope to the buoy so that you can pull the trap back to you without having to wade or swim too far., This step is optional, but it can help to increase your catch. Use pieces of dead fish, cat food, or artificial bait.Secure the bait in the trap with waterproof tape.

, Slowly submerge the trap into the water from your location on land or in a boat. Allow it to sink beneath the water. The fishing line will keep the trap weighted down. Wait a few hours or monitor the underwater action with your sounder.

, Locate your buoy. If your trap isn’t too far from shore, wade into the water and retrieve the trap by hand. If you attached a rope to the buoy, carefully start reeling the trap back to the surface. Stash your catch in a cooler to preserve their freshness. If you’re not happy with the results, repeat the process until you catch enough prawns.

Be aware that in the winter, bait (shad) is notoriously difficult to find and catch.,
Go deep in the cold water.,
Search hard to find a place where the shad have been attacked by predatory fish, like stripers or catfish.,
Add sufficient handle to the net to reach the target depth.,
Cruise slowly while watching the sonar for a large number of flashes in a single spot.,
Steadily pull the net back up to the boat and grab the ""horn"" of the net.,
Rinse the net.,
Prepare the shad.",How to Catch Shad with a Throw Net in the Winter,";
, This sometimes needs to be as much as 50 feet. The shad form tight schools that cruise along the bottom searching for food. They are virtually invisible to the older fish-finding sonar units.

,  The shad will form a protective tight ball to protect individual shad from attack. Look for the pattern of the ball of shad above the bottom on the sonar unit and drop a round cast net on them. There is a learning curve involved, but there are other preparations to make before casting the net at them.  

, The cast net generally comes with 25 feet of handline, not nearly enough if the shad are 50 feet deep.


Cast nets come in various sizes from 3.5ft to 20ft radius. A 3.5 ft net will open up to make 7 feet across. 
In Oklahoma, there is no limit as to the maximum size of net that can be used, so you can use a 10 foot net. (Some other states require maximums of 7 feet and some States do not allow them to be used at all.) The purpose of a larger radius net has to do with the depth of the water.  As a net sinks, the actual netting causes resistance against the water, closing the net as it falls. A 10 foot radius (20 ft diameter) net is only 12 feet in diameter by the time it reaches 50 feet.

,  Quickly cast your net directly over the shad and allow the net to go all the way to the bottom.  Once it is there, the work begins. 

, Lift the net over your prepared cooler and allow the net to open directly into the cooler, dumping your catch neatly into the chest. 

, When you have captured enough bait for the trip, rinse the net out over the side and then allow it to dry or roll it up until you get back to the house, then unroll it and allow it to dry. Mildew will destroy an expensive net.

, The shad should always be cut in at least two pieces. The smallest ones are cut and baited with both parts. Use circle hooks for best results.

Fish for shad in coastal rivers.,
Fish in the spring and summer.,
Fish where's there's a strong current.,
Fish at the right depth.,
Fish within 30 feet (9.1 m) of the bank.,
Get a lightweight rod and line.,
Use barbless hooks.,
Use the right bait and lures.,
Consider using a net.,
Learn their patterns.,
Cast upstream.,
Try to find the line.,
Cast in the same place more than once.",How to Catch Shad," Shad divide their time between the sea and coastal rivers, where they travel in spring in order to spawn. They can travel hundreds of miles upstream during a season, and are nicknamed ""poor man's salmon."" Unlike salmon, however, most shad don't die after they spawn.


In the Western US, the Colombia and Sacramento rivers are the best places to fish shad.In the Eastern US, the best place to find shad is in the Connecticut river. However, shad can be found in rivers as far south as Florida.;
, Shad spend their autumns and winters in the ocean, so the best time to fish them is during the spring and summer, when they return to the rivers for much easier access. Most people begin fishing shad in April and May.

, You want to face the current so you can catch the fish as they swim upstream. They'll move toward the shore, where there's less drag from the current.Look for areas where there's a bend in the river, since the current is faster there and will tend to propel the fish toward the shore.


Shad often congregate just below rocks and islands, and where water flows from fast to slow., It's easiest to catch shad in places where the water is no more than 10 feet (3.0 m) deep, and no less than 4 feet (1.2 m) deep. Check out the fishing guides for the river you plan to fish to find out where you should set up shop., Since fish tend to hug the shore in an effort to avoid the current as they swim upstream, you're much more likely to catch them if you cast within 30 feet (9.1 m) of the bank. Depending on where you're fishing, you might want to anchor a small boat to give you more casting freedom.

, Fishing shad does not require a heavy rod. Go for a long, lightweight spinning or fly rod in fiberglass. Use the lightest line you can find for the size fish available in your region., This will make it easier to release other fish that you're not aiming to catch. Silver or gold size 1 or 2 works are sufficient for shad.

, To catch larger, heavier shad you'll need to individually attract them with the right bait and lures. Switch them out to experiment with what works well with the fish in your area.Flys in white or yellow with red heads are popular.Beads should be used in the colder water to entice and attract the deeper shad. Cast from upstream, allowing the beads to slowly float towards the shad making them appear alive.
Darts should be used when fishing in deeper cooler water. They will sink further and faster than a fly.
Spinners should be used when fishing from shore, floating from upstream to downstream.
Spoons work most efficiently at about mid-level water. Use these when fishing from a boat, casting out and then reeling in at a medium speed.

, If you want to catch smaller fish to use as bait, you can use a net. Your casting net needs the correct mesh for the shad you are catching. Smaller shad will fall through the larger mesh holes. A typical shad casting net is 7 foot (2m) in circumference, weighing 1/2 lb (227g) with 1/2 inch (1.3cm) mesh.


Prepare the net to make it easier to throw and more effective by soaking it overnight in a washing machine or tub with hot water and fabric softener. Then lay it outside in the sun for a day. Once dry, the net will be more flexible and easier to use.

, Shads' location in the water varies with the weather patterns. During the spring and summer, search for shad in the early evening or right before daylight (though you can catch them at any time of day).


In the evenings, shad can be found in the warmer water towards the back of a cove or creek. During mornings or after dark, shad can be found around sources of light.
In the fall you will need to plan more around the cold weather patterns. The colder currents will push the shad out of the creeks and coves to the deeper water, making them more difficult to catch.

, The best way to fish shad is to cast upstream and let your line float downstream a bit with the current. Your lead should lightly flick the bottom, but it shouldn't sink so far it gets stuck. With luck, it'll cross the path of a school of shad. Make sure you're casting within 30 feet (9.1 m) of the shore, and try for a spot where the fast current meets slower waters.

, Shad travel in single file lines, rather than in big groups. That means it's easy to go home empty handed after a day of fishing in the wrong spot and missing the line of shad by just a few feet or even inches. Don't give up too easily if your first few castings don't field a bite.

, When you do find that line, keep fishing it. Where there's one shad, there are bound to be more. Shad fishing's popularity is due in part to a fisherman's ability to go home with a cooler brimming with fresh fish at the end of the day; all you've got to do is find that line, and you're set."

Get the proper equipment.,
Get the right bait.,
Get a fishing license.,
Go out at the right time of day.,
Find a spot with deep water.,
Cast your bait.,
Get a bite.,
Keep fishing if you catch one.",How to Catch Perch," This usually means getting a rod, reel, and some fishing line to spool on. The rod should only need a 6 to 8 pound test. Perch are smaller fish, and do not require complicated or expensive equipment.You may also want a cooler or stringer to hold you fish, especially if you catch several, or want to keep fishing after a catch.;
, Live bait is best, and perch prefer minnows and insect larva. Many anglers have also found crayfish meat to be popular with perch as well.Get the right lures. If you can't get live bait, artificial lures such as plugs, jigs, and spinners are good ways to draw in perch. Yellow, white, and yellow-white designs seem to be the most popular, but perch have been known to favor other colors and designs.Perch are smaller fish and move quickly, so you'll need a lure that reacts to less movement and is easy for you to keep an eye on., Some states require a fishing license depending on where you fish and what kinds of fish you are searching for. Make sure you know your state's laws, and that your license is up to date.Be sure to check if the license comes with any catch limits. You don't want to get in trouble for taking too many fish. Plus, that isn't fair to other anglers.

, Like other fish, perch are most active when feeding, so if you want to catch one, this is when you should be out there. The time of day they feed depends on the season you are fishing. These are some general guidelines, as the best feeding times can change day by day.During late spring and early summer, early morning and early evening hours are best.
During late summer, late afternoon and evening is best.
In autumn, the best times are morning, and late afternoon evening.
During the winter, the low light of late afternoon-evening is good.

, Perch like areas with deep water and structures that block sunlight and provide them places to hide.


Boat fishing is a good way to get into deep water, and allows you to move quickly if fish aren't biting or the school moves.
Shore or dock fishing are good places to catch perch. They like the shelter of man-made objects, and can usually be found near overhanging trees or other cover.If you are near the shore, look for areas that will have a steep drop-off into deep water. Your state's Department of Natural Resources may have topographic maps to locate these spots., There are a variety of methods you can use to attract perch.Perch, and other fish, like to feed off the ground, so you will need to make sure your line can go deep into the water.


Bait casting. Cast your line out into an area where the fish might be. Let it sit for a while, reeling in if you feel the need to recast. Aim beyond the point you want to hit, as it's always easier to pull your line back.
Still fishing. This involves dropping your line into the water and letting it sit, seeing if the fish come to you. You can do this from the shore, a dock or pier, or an anchored boat. This method involves the most patience, as you will not do much more than sit and wait for the fish to bite.
Trolling. Drop your line into the water, and move, letting your line drag through the water. You can do this by having your boat move slowly through the water, or by walking slowly along a shoreline or pier. If you are in a boat, you will need to keep the engine running lightly to avoid scaring the fish. Some states do not allow motorized trolling, so make sure you are familiar with regulations before trying it.
Ice fishing. Perch are active in the winter, so you can still catch them even in water that is frozen over. Fish in the winter are move more slowly, so if you find them they probably won't go to far. With the thick ice, having an electronic fish finder can help you figure out the best place to cut into the ice.

, Perch are light fish, so you will have to be quick about noticing when you get a bite. Once you see your line move, set your hook by pulling up quickly on the rod. As you reel in the line, pull your rod upward as well. You don't want to pull too hard, as you might pull your hook out of the fish.


It may help to have a bucket or small net to hold the fish once you get it out of the water.

, Perch are schooling fish, so if you find one, you'll find many more. Once you find a school, keep re-baiting your hook to get as many as possible. Schools move around, so if your catches dry up, you'll need to move.By the same token, if you aren't catching any fish, move. Perch stay in their schools, and if they aren't in one place, look for another one.

Use large chunks of native fish or entire fish for bait.,
Pick a durable rod that can flex and is long enough to carry the load of a large fish.,
Select a a reel with enough cranking power in order to pull in a monster catfish.,
Wear high rubber boots and comfortable clothes.",How to Catch Monster Catfish1," You want to make sure that you don’t use artificial lures, or smaller bait like prawns. Catfish require bait from their natural habitat, so you should choose a freshwater fish that swim in the same rivers. Using bait like chicken livers or other species of fish may work, but they are not as consistent.Two types of freshwater fish that are good at luring catfish are shad or skipjack, as they are natural to most catfish habitats.Catfish have a keen sense of smell and will be able to detect your bait from long distances. ;
, Stiff graphite rods are not suitable for catching catfish because they do not flex and bend enough, which could cause it to crack or break. Instead, choose either an e-glass or composite rod that is 7 - 12 feet long, because the added length will allow you to bare a higher load, and the flexibility of those rods will absorb some of the fight from the fish and the river's current. You’ll be struggling with the catfish who is at the bottom of the river and these properties are crucial so your rod won't break.


A longer rod will also allow you to cast out further, which may be required when boat fishing or fishing in a deeper lake or river.

, A large, round, conventional reel will do, but it must have a good drag system and large line capacity if you want to catch the biggest fish. Because you will likely be fishing in a river or other source of water that has a current, a good drag system will allow your bait to float with the current from where you cast it., and the line capacity will give you enough fishing line to accommodate it.


Use 20 to 30 pound test monofilament line so it won’t break under pressure.
Use a slip bobber ring for your hook because they are the best for catching bottom dwellers like the catfish. Slip bobber rings have three curved hooks so when the catfish takes the bait it will ensure that he won't tear away, harming the fish and losing your prize!

, You’re going to be out in muddy water, and depending on the weather conditions, it could get very cold. When you fish for giant catfish you should wear comfortable clothes for the long haul.


Because you’re shoes are likely to get wet, wear rubber boots to avoid trench foot, a dangerous condition one can contract from having their feet submerged in cold water over prolonged periods of time. "

, In Northeast North America, it is typically June through October, while the season in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Californian coast usually ranges from August to March.

,


Find a government agency or other location where you can apply for your license. You may be able to purchase your license at a local bait and tackle shop or marina.
Fill out the application and pay any application fees. Some agencies may also require you to take and pass a test to receive a license.

,


Note the number of lobsters you are allowed to catch per day.
Check for time limits. Many locations will not allow night diving to catch lobster. Common time spans for lobster fishing are sunrise to sunset.
Determine the number of lobster traps you can use at 1 time. There are also regulations for the number of lobster traps that you can have on a single fishing boat.
Map out any areas that are off limits for lobster fishing. Check for marine preserves and other protected areas before setting off on a boat for a day of lobstering.
Learn the size limits for caught lobsters. Many areas will fine you if you keep under- or over-sized lobsters.

, Lobsters generally hide during the day and hunt nocturnally.


Look for clawed lobsters in coastal waters from 4 to 50 m (13.1 to 164 feet) in rocky areas, especially those with ledges or crevices.
Check rocky environments such as rocky reefs for spiny lobsters.

,


Make sure you have a lobster trap, heavy-duty gloves, a lobster gauge and a catch bag if you are targeting clawed lobsters.
Bring heavy-duty gloves designed for underwater use, a tickle stick, net, lobster gauge, a catch bag, and either snorkeling or scuba gear or a hoop net if you target spiny lobsters.

, Chartered boats are often available, as well as rentals, or you may own a fishing boating.


Follow any licensing requirements. Some areas require you to have your license number showing somewhere on the fishing boat.

, Choose an area with a rocky environment.

, Lobster traps generally have 2 compartments. The first compartment has 2 funnel like openings and an area where you place the bait. The lobster enters 1 of the openings to eat the bait and then enters a third opening which leads to the second compartment of the trap.


Put bait in the bait compartment. Don't use offal-many regions have regulations against this. Use dead fish.
Make sure your lobster trap meets current regulations. Lobster traps should have an escape hole so that under-sized lobsters can easily get out of the trap. Also check for a biodegradable escape/ghost panel. This is an area of the trap that will eventually disintegrate in case the trap gets lost. This allows any caught lobsters to get free of the trap so they won't die.

, You may need to write your license number on the tags.

, Label the buoy clearly with your name or initials and your license number with paint or a permanent marker.

,,,, A lobster gauge is a metal or plastic metal measuring device that measures the carapace, or body shell, or a lobster.


Wear gloves.
Read your region's recommendations on how to measure before you begin lobster fishing. Some regulations state that you should begin measuring behind the lobster's eye stalks, and some measure from the center area between the lobster's horns.
Place the gauge at the top of the carapace. Read the measurement at the area where the carapace meets the lobster's tail.
Refer to your area's regulations to determine whether or not the lobster is over- or under-sized.

, Close the bag tightly to prevent lobsters from escaping.

, Check your area's regulations to make sure hoop nets are allowed for lobster fishing.


Hoop nets are composed of 2 metal rings with a collapsible metal netting between them.
You can scuba dive or snorkel for lobster from the shore, known as beach diving, or from a boat.;
,


Go to an area where you want to lower the net. People generally lower their hoop nets from boats, but some do so from surfboards.
Make sure you are wearing heavy-duty gloves to protect your hands.
Place an aromatic or oily bait in the bait pouch at the bottom of the net. Good options for bait include anchovies, sardines, Pacific mackerel, or even raw chicken or a perforated can of cat food.
Keep a firm grasp on the line on top of the hoop net and lower it into the water. Lower to the bottom.
Attach a buoy to the line on the net to mark the net's location.
Wait 10 to 15 minutes to allow lobsters time to enter the net.
Pull the line up slowly. Check for lobsters in the net.

,


Put on your snorkeling or scuba gear and make sure you are wearing protective gloves.
Choose a location to look for lobsters.
Scan the areas under rocks, coral and ledges for lobster antennae. Remember that most lobsters will be in hiding during the day.
Take out your tickle stick. A tickle stick is a narrow stick you use to help safely dislodge a lobster from its hiding spot.
Stick the tickle stick into the crevice where you see the lobster. Use a sweeping motion to encourage the lobster to move.
Grab the lobster with your hands, or use a net to catch the lobster.

Fish in a state where catfish are plentiful and legal for game fishing.,
Choose an area off a main river where catfish usually dwell.,
Locate an environment that catfish prefer, like areas with cover or along a rocky coast.",How to Catch Monster Catfish2," These bottom dwellers are native to the main channels and tributaries of Ohio, Missouri, and Mississippi.They can also be found in states like Arkansas, Louisiana, and Ohio. In some states like Alabama, catfish are non-game fish, which means that you can’t fish them for sport.Check with your state to see the legal status of catfish or you may be fined.

, Some areas along the river may attract more catfish like the mouth of a tributary off a main river, or a smaller channel. You should also look for inside river bends, as the current is weaker there and catfish prefer to swim in those areas.


If you are fishing in a lake, you can use sonar to detect sunken island, humps, or hills, as these are prime locations for catfish to feed.
Choosing a location that has a depth that is similar to how deep your baitfish swims is a good way to trick catfish into biting.

, While location is important to finding the where catfish may be, you also need to identify suitable environments. Catfish prefer thick cover, like trees that dip into the river, or aquatic vegetation like lily pads or log rafts.


Warm and humid places are a prime habitat for flatheads.
Their love of food makes catfish a pretty predictable predator. Think about where its food source would be and try fishing there.

Fish just before or after sunset, as catfish will usually be feeding during those times.
The best time to fish for the largest catfish in the U.S., the blue catfish, you should try to fish during the winter and the spring. Flathead and channel catfish are more likely to be found in the hot summer.

, Catfish have the ability to hear you by sensing the audio waves produced by sound. If you are making a lot of noise or sloshing around in the river, it might swim away. Limit conversation if you are fishing with someone else, or keep your voices very low.
Avoid playing music while fishing for catfish.

, There are several different ways you can fish for catfish. You can jug fish, which means you will cast a number of jugs that act as floats, with fishing line attached underneath or you can try more traditional methods like shore fishing or boat fishing.


Make sure to check your bait if the current is fairly strong. It’s possible that the water can wash your bait off your line.

, Once you hook a catfish, make sure that you leave enough slack for it to fully get hooked, but once it is you need to hold onto your reel tightly. Catfish are incredibly strong fish, and can easily pull your rod from your hands if you aren’t paying attention.


Work the reel up in a smooth motion to bring the catfish closer to you gradually. You want to make sure to sink the hook into it's mouth and not yank it away.
Allow the catfish to tire itself out, and make sure to use the current to your advantage if it is trying to swim upstream. You can allow your line to go out further if it means making the catfish tired, and thus easier to reel in.
If you are battling with a catfish for a long period of time, make sure that there is no slack on your line because it gives it the opportunity to wrestle loose. As long as your hook is sunk into its mouth, you should be able to reel it in eventually.

Find pompano schools on the far side of wave breaks and sand bars.,
Use a spinning rod, fish finder rig, 2/0 circle hooks, and 12-lb (5.5 kg) monofilament line.,
Catch sand fleas to use as bait.,
Cast right into the break of the surf and on the back sides of sand bars.

",How to Catch Pompano1," The fish wait for sand fleas, also called mole crabs, and other small crustaceans to be washed off the beach and carried to them by the wave action. This puts them in easy reach of anglers who prefer to fish from the beach or a pier.;
, Add a pyramid weight sufficient to keep your bait from returning to shore with the waves. You may need a bigger rod when the surf is heavy.

, Sand fleas are the pompano's favorite food and are readily available in areas where pompano are.


Look for v-shaped eddies when the waves roll off the beach. These are where sand fleas have washed ashore and are digging into the sand. Collect the sand fleas in a dry bucket.
If you can't find any sand fleas, it's likely that you won't catch any pompano. Move to a location where sand fleas are plentiful.
Pompano will eat other crustaceans, like shrimp, and even on occasion small bait fish.

Use a long rod, about 7 feet (2.1 m), with medium to heavy action.,
Choose monofilament or braid fishing line.,
Add a baitcasting reel.,
Add a wire leader at least a foot long on your line.,
Use live bait.,
Use dead bait.,
Use spoon lures.,
Consider buck tails, spinner baits, jigs and prop baits.,
Find waters at the entrances to lakes and bays.,
Go where the pike's prey live.,
Fly fish near the water's edge during springtime.,
Try boat angling in deeper waters in the summer.,
Lay the pike on its back.,
Using one hand, carefully insert one finger under each gill cover.,
Grip the chin bone firmly.,
Remove the hook with very long nosed pliers or forceps.

,
Return the fish to water as soon as possible.

,
Hold the pike, right side up, underwater, just above the tail.

,
Let go of the tail when the pike feels strong enough to swim away.,
Be prepared to nurse the fish even longer.",How to Catch Pike," The rod will need sturdiness in the lower half to handle the weight of a pike, but be nimble in the top half for accurate casting.;
, Monofilament strength should be at least 20 pound test. For braid, you'll have to go up to 50 pound test.

, They are dependable whether you're fly fishing near the shoreline or casting from a boat.

, Wire leaders are essential to prevent a pike's numerous, sharp teeth from severing your line.

, Pike are predators and seek out live fish. Small fish such as minnows are good for smaller pike. If you're fishing for large pike, increase the size of your bait accordingly. Pike like to feed on fish that are 1/3 the size of their length but can and will feed on smaller fish.

, Pike are also scavengers and will feed on dead fish. For best results, use fatty fish such as herring, sardines and mackerel. Or, insert or inject your bait with fish oil.

, If you don't want to handle live or dead bait, or they just aren't working, a spoon lure is a very effective alternative.

, They all work well for pike, and open up your baiting strategies.

, The mouth of a stream or river, or channels between islands are also popular pike habitats.

, Walleye are one of pike's favorite prey. Find the walleye and pike will be there, too.

, Big pike move into the shallows in the spring to spawn in weedy areas. The quick motion and bright flies of fly fishing are conducive to a pike's aggressive nature, making them more likely to strike.


Be far enough from your target area that you can cast without alerting the fish of your presence.
Be prepared for a strike at the last second. Pike have been known to break the surface of the water going after a fly.

, Larger female pike move to deeper waters during the less active months of summer.


Keep checking for rod vibrations. They indicate a pike has or is about to bite the bait.
When the line vibrates, give the rod a fairly good tug. This ""sets"" the hook in the pike's mouth.
If the hook does not set, let the bait sit. Pike are know to hit and let go several times before the bait is taken.
Be prepared for a fight. Pike are very quick, strong and aggressive. Combined with their weight and size, landing a pike can become quite physical.

, Hold it firmly between your knees.

, Let them slide towards the chin, following the triangular shape of the gill and jaw.

, Once you have it, gently lift the pike’s head upwards. The pike's mouth will open naturally.

,,,, This usually takes a few minutes.

, Be absolutely sure it is fully recovered before releasing it.

Use a light-action rod with 4 to 6 pound test line.,
Choose a lure that mimics native baitfish.,
Use night crawlers, minnows or salmon for live bait.,
Use a depth finder.,
Try jigging for trout.,
Troll for trout when they're scattered.,
Watch the line continuously.Large trout will slowly swim away after biting the bait.,
Look in North American lakes.,
Find them in cold, deep water.,
Fish for trout all year round.,
Fish near dropoffs and ledges.,
Look near feeding areas.",How to Catch Lake Trout," This is the best rod to use for trout fishing and allows you to use a variety of techniques to catch your trout. The lighter line has less friction with the water, allowing you cast your line to the very bottom of the lake with ease.

/images/thumb/3/38/Catch-Lake-Trout-Step-6-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Catch-Lake-Trout-Step-6-Version-3.jpg









Some lake trout can be over 35 pounds, you will need a heavier rod for these. If you know you're fishing a lake that has massive fish, bring a heavier rod as well.
Use an open faced spinning reel with a thin line. Be sure to put the reel on the rod facing the correct direction.
Use either number 6 or 10 hooks.;
, Since lake trout feed on a number of different native species, the best lure is the one that most closely mimics their individual food preferences. If you're not sure which lure is best, ask around at the local bait and tackle shop. Local anglers will be able to tell you what to use to catch lake trout in your area.Small weightless lures and spinners typically make the best artificial bait.
Add shiny metal foil or beads to further attract the trout.

, If you prefer to use live bait, these three options are usually the best bet. Again, ask at your local tackle shop to find out what the fish in your area are biting on lately. Fish have different preferences depending on the season and region.

, Since catching lake trout is so dependent on finding out at what depth they're located, investing in a depth finder can make or break your day's success. Lake trout prefer to be in approximately 53 degree water. Their depth and eating habits will change with the weather.


In the early spring and fall lake trout swim at a depth of between 35 and 45 feet (10.7 to 13.7m).
Later in the spring and in the summer they move deeper to 50 to 65 feet (15.4 to 19.8m).
In cold weather, when the lake is iced over, trout are found closer to the surface, at a depth of about 10 feet (3 m).

, This technique is best in areas where fish are concentrated, so you might want to try it if you're fishing a well-stocked lake. Use a spoon jig or a white buck-tail jig, and bait with a minnow or a piece of sucker meat. Drop your line near the bottom of the lake and slowly work your way up, jiggling the line to so that your jig resembles a wounded baitfish and attracts your trout.
/images/thumb/1/13/Catch-Lake-Trout-Step-10-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Catch-Lake-Trout-Step-10-Version-3.jpg
/images/thumb/1/13/Catch-Lake-Trout-Step-10-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Catch-Lake-Trout-Step-10-Version-3.jpg









This technique does not require any special rod or reel. Be sure the jig you use is light, just 1/2 ounce to 3/4 ounce.
This technique works best from a boat, rather than the shore.

, Trolling is the better technique to use when fish aren't concentrated into schools, but scattered in different places around the lake. You ""troll"" for fish by moving around to find them. Be sure to use your depth finder, and you might want to use a fish finder, too. You can troll for fish from a boat or on shore, as long as you'll be able to cast your line deep enough. To troll for fish, do the following:


Use a spinning reel or bait caster and any type of rod with the properly weighted line. Attach a weight so that you can cast to the proper depth and drag the hook along without it rising to the surface. The weight is determined by your speed and the season. Use a light lure or a spoon, or use a live minnow that's hooked through the lips.
Drive your boat to the middle of the lake and use your depth finder and fish finder to find a good starting spot. Start trolling at a slow speed once you have reached the desired depth. The key is to go very slow.

, You will have to feel and watch the line to know when you have a bite. Small trout will furiously swim away, causing the line to vibrate quickly. Jerk the rod up 1 to 2 feet (31 to 61cm) to further hook the trout once it has bitten.
/images/thumb/b/b1/Catch-Lake-Trout-Step-12-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Catch-Lake-Trout-Step-12-Version-3.jpg
/images/thumb/b/b1/Catch-Lake-Trout-Step-12-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Catch-Lake-Trout-Step-12-Version-3.jpg









Reel the trout in slowly, keeping the rod above your head.
Remove the trout from the hook and either place in a cooler or return back to the water.

, The largest concentration of lake trout is found in Ontario, Canada, where 25 percent of the world's lake trout population lives. Lake trout are commonly found in lakes stretching as far south as Kentucky. They have also been introduced to lakes in Europe, Asia and South America.


Lake trout are so popular among anglers that their natural population has been overfished. Lake trout are commonly stocked in lakes to meet the demand of anglers.Since lake trout like cold water, they're less commonly found in warmer regions like the southern US.

, Lake trout like to spend time where it's colder. You're more likely to find a good supply of lake trout in a deep, cold lake than in a shallow, warmer lake. Check around your region to find out the best places to go trout fishing, or ask local anglers where the deepest spots of your local lake are.

, Trout fishing can be done during any season. It's important to know where they like to spend time in different types of weather. During the summer, trout can be found in the deepest, coldest parts of the lake. After the lake ices over, they're found closer to the top, since the shallower waters are cool enough for them.


Once you find a good spot for trout fishing during a certain season, return to it the next year during the same season and you're likely to find a good trout supply there again.
If there's one time of year when trout are most difficult to catch, it's probably the middle of summer, when the lake is warmest and the trout are in its darkest depths. It's more difficult to figure out where the trout are hanging out and reach them with your line., Trout are often found near natural dropoffs and ledges, since the water near these features tends to be deeper and cooler. If you're fishing from the shore, it's especially helpful to set up near a dropoff rather than casting your line from a place where the grade is more gradual.

, Trout feed on smaller fish as well as plankton, and you can often find them under a school of smaller fish. They hang out underneath to wait for a weaker fish to get close enough to eat. These smaller fish feed on underwater vegetation. If you're fishing from a boat, set up near an area with plenty of vegetation to see if trout might be hiding under the smaller schools of fish.


Knowing the specific feeding habits of the smaller baitfish in your region can be very helpful. Talk to an experienced angler at a bait and tackle shop to find out more about the eating habits of local lake trout.

Locate a pompano school on the down current side of a bridge.,
Use 20-lb test line in case you hook a larger fish.,
Collect small fiddler crabs to use as bait.,
Anchor your boat or tie it to and up current piling.,
Chum every 15 minutes or so.,
Allow your bait to sink to the bottom, pull it up slightly, and let it hit bottom again.",How to Catch Pompano2," They wait for small crustaceans to be pulled off the bridge pilings by the current. The pompano will linger in one place as long as there is food coming their way, making them easy to catch by anglers who prefer to fish from a boat.

, Attach an egg sinker, about 12 inches of leader, and a size 6 hook.

, Break off the big claw before baiting your hook.


Place some rags in a bucket and just cover the crabs with seawater. Fiddler crabs will live several days in a shady place.

, Drop your line near the down current pilings.


Pompano will be on one side of the bridge when the tide comes in and the other side when the tide goes out, so you will have to move your boat if the tide changes.

, Chumming is the practice of dumping cut bait or fish parts into the water to attract fish. When fishing near a bridge, scrape barnacles and mussels from the pilings with a long-handled garden scraper and allow the current to carry them toward the pompano.

, The bait will disturb the sand on the bottom, which attracts the fish. You may have to change the weight of your sinker to accomplish this. Let your line play out as the current drags your line toward the down current pilings.

Get a cast net.,
Find a good spot to cast.,
Practice casting the net at home.,
Spot the mullet in the water.,
Cast your net.,
Retrieve the net.",How to Catch Mullet1," Because of the way mullets tend to congregate in large schools and appear close to the surface of the water, it is probably most common for people to fish them with cast nets. While this is an easier and more efficient method than using a hook and line, mullets are known to have excellent eyesight and can dart away quickly when they see a net being cast.When getting a net, check your local fishing regulations for permitted mesh size.
In Florida, for example, it is not permitted to use a net for freshwater bait fishing that is greater than 1 inch stretched mesh.;
, You need to find a place where mullet gather that you can reach with your net. It's not uncommon the find mullet near sea walls, off piers, inshore from boats, as well as in shady canals and streams.If you don't have a good idea of where to look, ask someone in your local fishing shop or club

, Before you go out there and cast your net into the water, you want to be sure you know how to handle it. The mullet might not hang around to give you a second chance if you get it wrong. A good way to practice is just t set up some kind of target in your backyard, such as an old tire or a ball.


Stand a few feet away and try to catch the target in the net.
Move further away as you get better to test your skills.

, Mullet often travel in big schools and can be quite active in the water, leaping in and out. This means that if there are some nearby they can be quite easy to spot. Look for disturbances in the water, such as patches of bubbles. Be patient and watch for fish breaking the surface of the water., Once you have spotted some mullet within reach, it's time to cast your net. Wrap the end of the rope around your throwing wrist, with the rest of the rope loosely coiled around your arm. Allow the net to droop by your side with the weights at the bottom.


With your other hand, take hold of the lead line at the point directly below your right thumb.
Now with you right hand take hold of the lead line and hold it out about an arms length from your other hand, which will be in front of your chest.
Rotate you body back to the right and swing forward, releasing the net at a slight upward angle towards the fish., Once cast the net will sink into water, trapping any unfortunate mullet. Keep a slight tension on the rope so you can feel what is going on. The net will descend in the water. After a while you will feel it hit the bottom and the rope you are holding will stop drawing down into the water. Soon after this happens begin to pull it back in towards you. A sharp tug when you feel it hit the bottom will close the net and trap the fish.Coiling the rope over your arm as you pull it in will help to keep everything tidy avoid the risk of tripping or tying yourself up.

Scout your location.,
Choose bait that attracts halibut.,
Choose a strong but lightweight fishing line.,
Fish with several other people.,
Drop your bait close to the bottom of the sea floor.,
Wait for a halibut to take the bait.,
Set your hook and steadily pull the line up with control.,
Allow a “spooked” halibut to run free for a bit.,
Keep at least the halibut's head underwater.,
Raise the wounded halibut alongside the boat.,
Prepare the fish for eating or storage by filleting it.",How to Catch Halibut," Halibut prefer to remain near the bottom of the ocean, usually at depths of around 40–80 feet (12–24 m); rarely will they be found below 120 feet (36.6 m) (36 m).They also prefer to hang out in “hydraulic relief zones” — current-calming obstructions like depressions, valleys, rock formations, and the like at the bottom of the sea.You can utilize sonar and other electronic equipment to map out the depths and contours of the ocean below and identify good fishing spots. It never hurts to pair this with firsthand advice on prime fishing spots from successful halibut anglers, of course.;
, Experts on catching halibut often advise the use of bait such as live squid or octopus, or mackerel heads or guts. Artificial bait such as plastic fish colored like a sardine or anchovy can also be used in halibut fishing. Add attracting scents to your bait and line as well, and chum liberally and regularly to lure halibut in.Luminescence and movement help draw halibut in, although jerking movements of the bait can have the opposite effect.

, The size and strength of halibut mean that they can snap weak or low-quality lines. At the same time, though, lines that are too heavy-duty or offer too much stretch may make the reeling process too difficult. Aim for a low stretch, high quality Kevlar or Spectra line at 80 - 120 pound test strength.Use a light fishing line to prevent you from tiring too quickly when you reel the halibut in. A California halibut can weigh around 50 lbs. (23 kg), while a Pacific halibut can be over 500 lbs. (230 kg).

, It’s always nice to have some company while fishing, right? Also, this puts more bait in the water to draw fish. Yes, this also means more competition for your prize, but adding more chum and bait to your fishing area will still improve your odds of catching a halibut.


If going halibut fishing alone or with a few people, create your own chum slick to draw fish to your boat., This is where halibut typically spend their time. Once you hit bottom, reel back a bit so you are just off the floor. Wait for around thirty seconds for a bite before moving the bait again.Raise and lower the bait a few feet (meters) or gently move it from side to side in the water to help attract the fish to your line.

, If, after about a dozen casts, you haven’t had a bite, you may want to consider repositioning. Try exploring one of your other target spots.Once you do get a bite, fight your instinct to set the hook by pulling — a powerful halibut is likely to slip free this way. Instead, allow your fishing line to lower back into the water until it goes tight.

, Wind and lower your fishing rod and then pull again, bringing the halibut up close to the water's surface. Take your time and go easy. Halibut will often come to the surface without much resistance if a gentle touch is applied. Keep going until the fish is just below the water’s surface., Don’t try to fight it or pull it closer, or you will likely lose your hook or break your line. Instead, give it some slack and wait for it to calm back down. Then, try slowly but surely bringing it up again. Remember, this magnificent fish is worth the extra time., You need to weaken this powerful fish before bringing it aboard. Flailing halibut have been known to seriously injure unsuspecting anglers. Make sure your prize is unable to put up resistance before putting it on your boat.Use a gaff or harpoon to wound the fish. Aim for the solid area just behind the head, and drive the gaff or harpoon straight through. Wait for the fish to grow tired and lose some blood.
Some people use guns to wound halibut. However, this is illegal in some areas; you risk ruining some of the best meat on the fish (the cheeks); and it’s simply a more dangerous practice than is necessary.

, Tie it up (“hog tie” style) and cut its gill rakers with a knife. Bleeding the fish further will kill it and provide cleaner meat later. Stay on your guard until you know the fish is dead — even when it’s on death’s door, a halibut can still injure you.Put the dead halibut on ice as soon as possible.

, This works better for halibut meat than trying to cut it into steaks. Remove the skin for short-term storage, as it can affect the flavor of the meat.However, if you intend to freeze the fillets for longer than a couple months, you may want to keep the skin on and rinse the meat down with salted water. Then vacuum seal it and freeze it.

Gather your supplies.,
Connect the bottles.,
Prepare the stitching.,
Sew the bottles together.,
Puncture the bottle.,
Attach a line.,
Find a minnow-rich area.,
Set the minnow trap.",How to Catch Minnows1," You can create an easy trap from common household supplies. The base of the trap is created out of two empty soda pop bottles. The pop bottles will be rigged to attract minnows in, but won’t let them out. You’ll need these supplies:


2 2-3 liter pop bottles
1 woodworking nail (size isn’t important)
Twine or small string
Scissors
Pliers
Access to a flame
15-20 feet of rope, string, or twine;
, Use your scissors to cut out a third of the bottom of one bottle. It is important to keep the cap, or top part, untouched. Cut out the “neck and shoulders” of the second bottle. This is the top portion of the bottle; a half inch below the part of the bottle where the sides begin to straighten out.The bottles must be the same size before you cut into the bottles.
Remove the cap from the second, smaller bottle.
Take the second bottle and insert it into the first bottle.

, Turn on your flame to a low setting and grip your nail’s head using pliers. Once your grip is secure, place the point directly in the flame for about thirty seconds. Poke 10 to 12 holes around the bottom circumference of the conjoined bottles. Space out the holes about an inch apart.

, Use the string or twine to sew the two bottles together. You can either use a large piece of string to sew around the circumference, or use individual strings to secure the bottles. If you are sewing, thread the string over into a hole followed by an under thread.


You could also cut out individual strings for each hole. Use a double knot on each hole.
If you sewed the bottles, tie the tail securely in a double knot and cut off the excess string.

, Reheat the nail with the flame using the grip from the pliers. Let the nail’s point heat for about 30 seconds. Create several holes all over the top bottle. Create at least two dozen or so holes. Reheat the nail if it becomes tough to puncture through the plastic., The trap works by sinking into a body of water for several hours. To reel the trap in, you'll need to attach a rope or string. Gather a long narrow rope, string or twine that is about 15-20 feet. Tie a double knot to the top of the trap around the neck.


Tie the opposite end to a nearby tree or secure it with a heavy rock near the water.
Use a secure object that is close to the water so the trap will sink deeper.

, Search for a spot along a moving body of water like a stream or creek. Creeks will have a larger population of minnows. Check a map to locate creeks that feed into a larger body of water.

, Now it’s time to fill the trap with bait to lure in the minnows. The trap is designed to attract minnows inside, but won’t let them out. Add some bread or crackers through the bottom of the trap and shake the trap to secure the bait. Once the rope is secured around the bottle and nearby object, toss the trap into the water.


Check on the trap in two hours. The trap will be more effective if left overnight.
Pour the captured minnows into your bait bucket."
"
Acquire your bait.,
Prepare a bucket to keep the bait alive and ensure that water temperature does not vary drastically from the area where you will be fishing.

,
Prepare your rods, leaders, hooks and lines using action rods and lightweight, dull-colored line.,
Locate a good spot for kingfish by checking with locals.

,
Look for birds hovering over the water as a sign of schools.

,
Direct your boat to the outside of the school rather than the middle, going slowly to avoid scaring away the fish.

,
Slow your boat to idle speed when you have located kingfish.

,
Set up at least two trolling lines running about 20-30 feet (or 6-9 meters) behind the boat.,
Hook your live bait.

,
Proceed slowly, making sure that the bait are swimming below the surface of the water in a natural way.,
Grab the rod when you feel a kingfish on the line.

,
Allow the kingfish to move along the side or in front of the boat as you pull in line and reel in slowly only when you do not feel the fish pulling.

,
Gaff the fish when you have successfully brought it alongside the side of the boat.

,
Pull it into the boat and store it for the rest of the trip.

",How to Catch Kingfish,"


Only use live bait for kingfish. Larger fish like porgies are best, though minnows will also work. As you will be using at least two trolling lines or even double baiting, you will need lots of bait.;
,, Heavy line or line that shines will scare away kingfish.

,,,,,


They should be far apart from each other and run straight in the water.
A good spot to hook a porgy is at the nose. Double baiting, especially if using fewer trolling lines, will increase the likelihood of a kingfish biting.

,,


Do not allow bait to skip along the surface and replace bait as it tires or dies.

Find a prime spot for mullet.,
Prepare your tackle.,
Prepare your bait.,
Consider using a fly.,
Reel them in carefully.",How to Catch Mullet2," Where you find mullet will vary depending on what part of the world you live in, and which kind of mullet you are fishing for. Tidal rivers, estuaries, harbours and canals are all good places to find mullet. They are often close to the surface and in big schools, so if they are there, you should be able to spot them.


They are often found in big groups on a rising tide as they feed on algae., You don't need elaborate tackle to go after mullet. Just be sure to have a light rod with a click-drag reel. You will need long leaders with a 6lbs test strength as well as fine diameter lines to counter the mullet's excellent eyesight., Baiting for a mullets can be a tricky task, with all sorts of baits recommended and discouraged. No bait is every a certainty, and this is especially the case for the algae and invertebrate feeding mullet. There are a number of baiting options that have been successful for you to consider and experiment with. These include:


Ragworm.Bread or dough.
Peeled prawn., Given that mullets gather in schools near the surface, using a fly can be good way to fish them. You'll need a small fly, and don't expect a bright flashy lure will work on the bottom feeding mullets. Try tossing some clumps of oatmeal into the water and casting in front of the mullet as they feed.A bread and oatmeal batter mix can be effective when fly fishing for mullet.

, Once you've got a bite, you'll soon discover that despite their relatively modest size, mullets are fighters on the hook. Take care as you reel them in, don't try to pull them in too quickly. You can consider using a landing net for the final catch.


Using a braid line will help you feel the movements of the mullet in the water.Remember that mullets can really leap up out of water, so take extra care when landing them or they could jump off and away.

"
"
Opt for a homemade oatmeal chum.,
Prepare the tackle.,
Prepare the bait.,
Toss the bait and cast into the chum.",How to Catch Mullet3," Fishing for mullet with a regular hook and line can be very tricky. One way to increase your chances, but still use a hook and line, is to use a chum bait. A chum bait will attract large numbers of mullet who will begin feeding. You can then cast into the chum and you have a good chance of getting a bite or two in the frenzy.

, Use a medium to medium light spinning rod (6' or 7'), with a spin cast reel that you have spooled with line not heavier than 10lbs test. You can attach hooks spaced around ten inches apart, as well as adding a cork or floating marker for depth., Now you need to get your bait ready. You will need water, laying mash (such as chicken feed), and oatmeal. Mix equal parts mash and oatmeal in a small tub. Add enough water to get a consistency reminiscent of a dough ball. You don't want the mixture to be too thick, or you risk it taking too long to dissolve when you toss it in, or just sinking straight to the bottom.If it's too thin it'll dissipate and drift away.
Ideally, it should be break up and dissolve slowly to attract the mullet.

, Once you have found a good spot where you know there is mullet activity, it's time to toss the bait mix into the water. As soon as it starts to dissolve you need to cast into the chum. With a small piece of jerk bait threaded onto each hook, go ahead and cast.If you leave the hooks and line in the chum mix before casting, the chum may stick to your hooks and encourage the mullet onto them.

Understand the minnows.,
Use the right gear.,
Fish for minnows.,
Use waxworms.",How to Catch Minnows2," A lot of minnow species are too small to catch using a standard fishing pole. There are larger minnows such as the creek chub that are ideal for the fishing pole. Creek chubs are found particularly in smaller creeks that weave through the land that may lead to nearby river or lake.


Look at a map to best scout out one of these locations., Larger minnows are best caught using fly fishing techniques rather than standard spin fishing. It is advised to use small dry flies with a 3 weight fly rod. It is much more difficult to use a spin fishing rod for catching minnows alone. Here are specific flies that are commonly used to catch larger minnows:


Nymph fly
14 Humpy
Woolly worm, Again, this is a technique for more advanced fishermen who already have access to fly fishing gear and knowledge. Pick out a few local spots that are densely forested with plenty of creeks and a larger base of water nearby. Bring a large cooler for the minnows you catch.


Start early in the morning and spend some time fishing in the creeks.
Focus your fly around large trees and scout for schools of minnows.

, Waxworms are good bait for micro fishing, such as fishing for minnows. Attach the waxworm to your hook and cast your line into a creek. Don’t use a lot of slack with the waxworm attached. You barely need to submerge your line to attract a minnow with the waxworms.


Again, store what you catch in a large cooler with water to best preserve your catch.

Buy a minnow seine.,
Prepare the seine.,
Find a location with a lot of minnows.,
Set the seine.,
Stabilize the seine and wait.,
Check on the net.,
Separate the minnows or other bait.",How to Catch Minnows3," Minnow seines are a popular netting technique that generate many minnows without waiting all day or night. Certain fishing brands market these exclusively as “minnow seines.” Visit an outdoor store that has a fishing department or order one off the internet.Smaller seines work better for creeks.

, Gather two wooden boards that are about four feet tall. Use a saw to cut a sharp angle at the bottom of each board. Tie the seine to the top and bottom of each board.


You can also staple the seine or net to the wooden boards., Search for a spot along a moving body of water like a stream or creek. Creeks will have a larger population of minnows. Check a map to locate creeks that feed into a larger body of water.

, Locate an area of the body of water where the water flows above or around natural objects like rocks. Stick the boards with the seine attached into the creek using the sharper edges.

, Keep hold of the net while both the stream and creatures enter your contraption. Keep an eye out for schools of minnows as you stabilize the seine and support boards., After 10 to 15 minutes, lift the seine out of the water. Grip the bottom of the seine and meet it with the top of the seine. You should have an abundant supply of creatures caught in your net.


Try again if you didn’t catch any minnows. Be sure to align the bottom of the seine with the bottom of the creek's floor.
Relocate if you are still having troubles.

, Transfer the caught fish into your large cooler. Go through the fish that you caught and make sure that there isn’t any larger fish in the cooler. It’s okay if you caught other bait fish like a crayfish or a shiner.

Drop your anchor slightly upstream.,
Toss chum to the ocean floor.,
Attach live bait to your hook.,
Drop your line to the bottom of the ocean.,
Crank the reel so that your bait is suspended off the ocean floor.,
Keep the line tight and reel in when the grouper bites.",How to Catch Grouper1," Bottom fishing requires you to go offshore with a boat. The deeper the water, the larger the grouper typically is. Locate an area where there are rocks, ledges, or other natural or man-made structures. To determine the current, drop a buoy and wait five minutes for your boat to drift. Then motor back to the buoy and drop anchor 150 feet up-current.


To get the best grouper, you should go 30 miles (48.2 kilometers) to 85 miles (136.794 kilometers) offshore.Grouper will naturally swim on the current and into your bait.;
, Dropping chum to the bottom of the ocean will attract grouper to the area.You can purchase a grouper specific chum block at a fishing shop or you can create your own. To create your own chum, grind up fish bait and put it in a fine mesh bag.


You can use Jack Mackerel, sardines, and some menhaden oil as the base for your chum.Talk to the fishing shop owner about the most effective chum for grouper.

, Using live bait is a great way to get the attention of grouper swimming near the reef. You can attach your hook to your baitfish in a number of locations, including its nostrils, dorsal, or throat. Putting the hook through your baitfish's throat is the best method for bottom fishing., A weight or sinker is required to drag your bait to the ocean floor where grouper usually congregate.The movement of your live bait should attract grouper to the area. If you feel a slight tug on your line, it could be a bite or it could be your baitfish trying to make an escape.


If you feel your baitfish trying to escape to the rocks or another structure, reel down and raise your rod so that you can keep your fish out of the rocks.Check on your bait regularly to make sure that it hasn't fallen off the hook.

, You do not want your weight to bounce off of the ocean floor. To avoid this, crank your reel a couple turns, and lift your rod to straighten out the leader. Then, slowly lower your pole so that the bait sits on the bottom., Waiting is an important part of fishing. Not all areas are going to be grouper heavy, and there's a chance other bottom dwelling fish are going to take your bait. When you feel a tug on your line, crank your reel hard, then raise your rod. Continue doing it in this pattern until you can reel in the grouper.


The grouper tends to try to escape to its natural habitat and can tangle your fishing line.
Lay your rod on the rail of the boat to help give you stability and power while reeling in the fish.
If the fish has pulled your line to the reef or rocks, you can wait until it comes out of the reef and try to reel it in again.
If you feel like the grouper has tangled the line on the reef or rocks, you should cut your line.

"
Find a grouper prone part of the ocean.,
Drive your boat at 3-7 knots.,
Drop your bait into the ocean and count to ten.Leave slack on the line when you are dropping your bait.,
Lock your reel and wait.",How to Catch Grouper2," Take your boat to areas that would be suitable for grouper, like near coral reefs or underwater cliffs. When you begin to troll, make sure you are doing so off the rocks or your line might get snagged. Aim for the sandy areas around the rocks or areas where you think grouper are swimming.


Large amounts of grouper live in the Bahamas, Gulf of Mexico, South Carolina, and Florida.Circle back to areas where you felt bites, as these are likely fish prone areas.If an area is unsuccessful, change locations.

, Keep a steady speed as you troll the area.Going faster than 12 knots may cause your lure or bait to get dislodged from your line.When using live baits, make sure that you are trolling at lower speeds., As you begin to move your boat, the line will straighten out. Counting to ten will let the bait reach the bottom of the water. Your bait should be bumping on the bottom periodically, but not getting hung up on anything.


You can use artificial or live bait while you troll.
Check your line often if you are using bait to make sure that it hasn't become dislodged.

, Lock your reel and wait for a bite on your line. When you feel a bite, make sure to reel as hard as you can and raise your rod. You'll see the tip of your rod bend significantly when you've hooked a fish. Your rod should naturally bend by rubbing against the bottom of the ocean.


The momentum of your boat will help you pull grouper out of rocks or reefs if it tries to escape.

Get a durable and heavy duty rod.,
Get a spinning reel capable of holding a 50-100 pound test line.,
Use the right fishing line.,
Use the right baits and lures.,
Set up the proper rig.",How to Catch Grouper3," Get a conventional rod, so that the line is on top and not below your rod. This will give you more cranking power and allow you to put more pressure on it. Your rod should be six to seven feet, and capable of carrying a 50-100 pound test line., Grouper can get very large and weight a lot. Your reel will need a lot of cranking power so you can pull up the fish if it's a big. Depending on the waters you are fishing, getting a reel that can hold a 50-100 pound test line will ensure that your grouper won't break the line if you are bottom fishing or trolling.


Getting a reel with a low-gear ratio will make it easier on you as you crank the wheel., Braided lines have a high breaking strength and minimal stretch. Less stress will allow you to feel bites easier. Monofilament lines are not suitable when fishing for deep water grouper because they stretch a lot.If the depth of water is under 15 feet, you can use a monofilament line when fishing for grouper.Using a monofilament or fluorocarbon line for your leader is standard practice because of their transparency and stretch., Live bait is one of the best things you can use to lure grouper to your hook. You can fish for smaller native fish in the area, or you can go to the store to get live bait or purchase artificial lures. Grouper have large mouths and will go for larger baits, so keep this in mind when fishing for them.Grunts, pinfish, sardines, blue runner, squirrelfish, and white mullet are the best baitfish for grouper., Your rig will change depending on the size of fish you are trying to hook as well as your personal preference. Typically, you will have a sinker connected to a swivel, which will then connect to the leader which connects to your hook. Circle hooks are preferable when fishing for grouper.Make sure that your swivel is capable of handling a heavy load.


100lb ball bearing swivels are the best option when fishing for larger grouper.To learn more about setting up a rig for fishing, read Rig-a-Fishing-Line

Your leader should be at least four to six feet long."

Read up different varieties of gar.,
Decide which variety to fish.,
Plan an outing.",How to Catch Garfish1," Gar or garfish are a family of freshwater fish that live in North America, distinguished by their long, cylindrical bodies, short snouts, and rounded tail fin. They are also good sport fish. If you are thinking about trying gar, you should know that they come in several varieties, however. Take some time to learn about the different types, their habitat, and characteristics.


Alligator gar are probably the most striking. They are huge, growing up to 8 feet long and up to 300 pounds. Gator gar are brown or olive above and lighter underneath, with light spots, broad snout, and two rows of very sharp teeth.Longnose gar are very slender fish. They are smaller than alligator gar, maxing out at about 6 feet 8 inches and 35 pounds, but with a similar coloration, and most known for their elongated snouts, which are about twice as long as their heads.Shortnose gar lack spots. They also have much shorter snouts than longnose gar, as their name implies. The typical adult is about 2 feet long. Spotted gar usually grows to a length of about 2 feet, as well. Their bodies are brownish-olive, even on the belly, and are covered with dark spots.Florida gar have a ranged centered on the states of Florida and Georgia. They are olive-brown in color with spots, and mainly distinguished from spotted gars by their shorter snout. They grow to about 2 feet.;
, Although gar are generally good gamefish, each variety will give you a slightly different experience and require slightly different preparation. For example, Florida gar are usually found in streams or lakes with abundant vegetation, unlike their cousin the longnose gar, which prefers open water.Alligator gar will pose the biggest physical demands, certainly, because of their great size. They are also increasingly rare.Longnose are pound for pound the most challenging of the gar family. They are built like torpedoes and their slender snout is very difficult to hook.Shortnose, spotted, and Florida gars are fairly easy to fish, with broad snouts that take a hook quite easily. They still put up a fight, though!, Once you’ve decided which variety to fish, you’ll need to start planning your trip. You may need to do some traveling. Most gars across the Midwest or Eastern United States, but a few varieties have a much more limited range.


Longnose, shortnose, and spotted gar can be found throughout Eastern North America. The longnose inhabits streams, rivers, and lakes in the Midwest, while the shortnose ranges mainly in the Mississippi watershed. The spotted gar also lives in the Mississippi watershed, with a northern range near lakes Erie and Michigan.Shortnose gars like big rivers and lakes and don’t mind murky water as much as other varieties, while spotted gar prefer shallow open water or stagnant backwater.The Alligator gar was once found in the lower reaches of the Mississippi river watershed. Nowadays, it is mostly restricted to the states of Texas and Louisiana. Gator gars like slow-moving water, either fresh or brackish, and can be found in lakes and bayous.To get a Florida gar, you’ll have to go either to Georgia or Florida. Their range is limited to the swamps, streams, and canals, with a preference for slow water and vegetation."
"
Head south.,
Look for prime habitat.,
Bring heavy duty gear.,
Work the deep pools.,
Exhaust the fish.",How to Catch Garfish2," You’ll have to go a locality where you can fish for Alligator gar, for starters. That means packing up and heading south to the lower Mississippi river and the Gulf of Mexico.


Places in Louisiana like the Henderson Swamp and Lake Pontchartrain near New Orleans have Gator gar.In Texas, try the Colorado, Trinity, Guadeloupe, Sabine, or other large rivers or Lake Livingston., Alligator gar spawn in the spring, around April, but the best time to look for them is in the summer in July or August or whenever is hottest.


Concentrate on slack water or sloughs. Gator gar like to hang out in slow waters and especially like to congregate in deep holes near shallower water, where they can surface to feed.Keep your eyes open for large river bends that naturally create deep holes surrounded by sandbars. Alternately, you might try an oxbow lake. These are lakes that were once bends in a large river but silted over, became cut off from the main stream, and are slack water except for during floods.

, Alligator gars are extremely large and will need very heavy gear. Growing up to 200 pounds or more, with sharp teeth, you’ll need to be well prepared and to have a clear plan for what to do when (or if) you hook one.Most people use a large circle hook attached to a steel leader as a rig – this is because the fish is generally pretty hard to hook. Some people use a treble hook, however.
You’ll want to have a stiff composite rod with pretty robust-strength test line. A typical strength is anywhere from 30 to 100 pounds and a reel capable of spinning out 150 to 200 yards.
Bait up with a small fish like a whole, descaled mullet. Other people will use live bait like shiners, scad, carp, or perch.

, Cast into the deeper areas, as this is where a gator gar will most likely find your bait. Gar like to swim away once they have taken the bait, so allow it to take a bit of line before setting your hook.


Don’t set the hook too early. Otherwise, you will hook the fish in a poor place or dislodge the hook entirely.Wait for about seven second after the bobber and line take off, then set the hook. Pull hard and perhaps several times, as the setting will require a good deal of force.

, Once you’ve got it on the line, try to tire out the fish. Being so big, alligator gars are a tough fight and can easily injure you with either their body or sharp teeth. Slowly bring the fish in, avoiding logs and other obstructions.


Do not try to pull the fish aboard a boat unless it is completely exhausted. If may be useful to use a gill gaff in this instance to position the gar’s head away from others on the boat.
Because they are so potentially dangerous, many fishermen advise against fishing for gar unless you plan to kill them. Use extra caution if you choose to release the fish.
Make sure to bring along a de-hooker or pliers in order to remove the hook, if you are planning to catch and release, as well as protective gloves and arm protection. "
"
Choose your equipment.,
Make a rope lure.,
Try bait fish, alternately.,
Fish your lure in open water.",How to Catch Garfish3," For fishing longnose gar, you’ll want a solid rod with good strength test line. It needn’t be as strong as for alligator gar, but don’t underestimate the longnose. It is still a formidable fish.Many fishermen will recommend a 6 foot spinning rod with a good quality reel.
Use 14 to 30 pound test line. Also consider getting a superbraid, like Fireline or Cabela’s Ripcord. Not only does super braid have very little give – important for setting the hook – but it also is more difficult for the gar to snap with its sharp teeth.

, According to some fishermen, a lure made from a nylon rope is ideal for longnose gar. It is very hard from them to pull the lure free, nor can they cut the line as their teeth get entangled in the nylon.Take a 6 inch piece of 3/8th inch soft braided nylon rope. Then, using a lighter, melt one end and unravel the main braids from the other end. Leave about 1.5 inches for the lure head, and tie off the head with some unraveled strands
Take this artificial lure and tie onto your main line with a standard half-hitch or slip knot.

, Other fishermen like to use cut or live bait for longnose gar. It really is up to you. You might use a 4-6 inch minnow, for example, in which case, rig the bait through the eye on a #4 treble hook.

, Longnose gar prefer open water, so cast and gently retrieve your bait, keeping the rod held high. Watch your bobber for signs that a gar is hitting the bait.


Like an alligator gar, a longnose gar will take off as soon as it gets your bait. Let it go for at least a minute before you try to set the hook.
Wait until the fish stops to swallow the bait. Then, set the hook quickly and firmly.
Enjoy the fight! Longnose gar as known to be ferocious fighters on the line, but they usually fatigue quickly."
"
Prepare for your outing.,
Bait your lure.,
Fish away.",How to Catch Garfish4," General rules for equipment apply to shortnose, Florida, and spotted gar as held for the longnose. These fish will give you a good fight, so don’t underestimate them when preparing your rod, line, and tackle.


Keep in mind that fishing for these types of gar will be rather more easy than fishing for alligator or longnose gar, mainly because their snouts are broader. This should allow you to set a hook with more ease.
Go again with a 6 foot spinning rod with a good quality reel.
14 to 30 pound test line will work well, as will a superbraid line.

, As with other kinds of gar, many fishermen will go with either live or cut bait like shiners, perch, or scad. However, gar might also attack worms or grasshoppers. In general, they are voracious eaters and will tend to attack anything, live or dead.If you go with bait, use smaller fish or cut larger ones into smaller chunks.
Rig the bait on a treble hook. Some fishermen might recommend using a Kahle hook, but gar will sometimes swallow these whole. Removing a hook from the fish’s throat will do a lot of damage and probably kill it.A treble hook, on the other hand, will more easily snag the gar’s snout.
Another option is the Lambo lure spinner. These spinners are made specifically for gar and are smooth, so that they will not get caught up in the fish’s teeth and thus not set properly. Change the spinner’s hook to the treble to increase its effectiveness.

, The best time to go for shortnose, spotted, and Florida gar is the high summer. During this period you be able to find spots where gar congregate – look for them resting just under the surface of the water.


Cast just in front of or beyond the gar. Reel in the bait slowly with the rod held upright so that it passed just in front of the fish.
When the gar takes your bait, wait as with other varieties. The fish will swim away to swallow the bait, so you do not want to try to set the hook too soon.
Give the fish anywhere to a minute or more to swallow the bait. Then, reel in all of the slack line and give it a firm tug. Set the hook hard!Reel the gar in slowly until it is within reach of your boat. A net may be useful to land the fish and bring it aboard your boat.

Bowl for water. You can purchase collapsible bowls from hiking stores that look like caps and can carry water poured from your drinking bottle.
Leash. Whether or not leashes are required in the area you'll be hiking, it is a good idea to have one with you.
Collar with tags. It is important to have a collar and tags for identification purposes in case your dog gets spooked or wanders off.
Snacks. Some healthy dog chews or dog cookies are an important addition to your dog's hiking gear.
Paw protectors. Some dogs may need paw protection, especially if you will be walking on hot, very cold, or rough terrain. Dog booties can be purchased from dog parlors, hiking stores or pet stores. Check to see if your dog likes them before assuming that they will work on a hike.;
, In addition to outfitting your dog, you are going to want a few items for yourself. These things can help if you get lost, aid in an emergency, and make your hike comfortable and safe.Things to pack include:


Map
Compass
Emergency poncho
Small first aid kit
Water bottle
Snack
Wear hiking boots (or comfortable shoes with a good tread)

, It is important to respect the rules of the place where you are hiking. Some places do not allow dogs at all. Other places require a dog to be on a leash. Breaking these rules can lead to citations and/or fines, so be sure you understand the rules before you head out.Perform an internet search for the trail you plan to hike. You may find a website or message board with info about dogs.
Look for a phone number to a local visitor center. Call and ask about dog and/or leash laws on the trail.
Most National Parks do not allow dogs on trails, but most other federal lands are fair game.

Stay on the trail.,
Expect to see other dogs.,
Be aware of predators.,
Stay hydrated.,
Rest.,
Pick up the poop.",How to Hike with Your Hound2," Even where you are allowed hike with your dog without a leash, do not allow your dog to run around everywhere. This could crush precious wildflowers and fragile soil structures. Additionally, traveling off of the trail can get you both lost. Make sure that both you and your dog stick to the hiking trail., Before you head out on a hike, think about your dog's temperament. If you know that your dog likes to pick a fight, keep them restricted on a leash. It is very likely that you will encounter other people and dogs on the trail, so try to be prepared., Many wilderness areas contain predators—such as bears, snakes, or mountain lions. Research the predators that may exist in your area, and take necessary precautions.If you are hiking in an area with bears, always carry bear spray. Also, it is safest to hikes in groups of three people.
If you are hiking in an area with poisonous snakes, watch the trail and avoid stepping on one. You can also carry a snake bite kit.
If you are hiking in an area with mountain lions, avoid hiking at dawn and dusk, and avoid running on the trail.

, Both you and your dog should drink frequently. Drinking water at least once every half an hour is appropriate during an average hike. Bring your own water along, and avoid drinking (or allowing your dog to drink) from unfiltered water sources., Anytime you or your dog feel fatigued, it is important to rest. Don’t try to overexert yourself or your pet. Take a seat, catch your breath, and enjoy the beautiful scenery.

, Doggy-do in the wild is a complete no-no. Be prepared to pick it up and pack it out. Carry appropriate bags for disposal with you at all times.Be sure to bring:


Plastic bags
Hand-sanitizer

Check for ticks.,
Remove plant life.,
Thank your dog.",How to Hike with Your Hound3," Always check your dog for ticks at the end of a hike. If you are camping overnight, check the dog each night. Ticks are small insects that attach themselves to skin. Be sure to look near your dog’s backside, ears, and anywhere that the skin folds (such as the arm pit).


If you locate any ticks on your dog, you will have to remove them.
Be sure to check yourself for ticks as well!

, In addition to scouting for ticks, check your dog for any plant life. To avoid tangled hair and the potential for rashes and other allergic reactions, remove any prickles, burrs, thorns, or sticks that have become entangled in your dog's coat.Double-check your dog's eyes, ears and nose for seeds or prickles.
If you do find a problem that worries you, contact your vet.

, At the end of a hike, express your pleasure at how well your dog hiked and provide a small treat. This helps to establish a positive association for your dog, fosters additional bonding, and encourages good behavior on your next excursion.

, A stretch of rope and a knowledge of knots will take you many places-and may help you get out of them. With a stick and hook, catching a meal in a nearby river will be a pinch-as long as you bait your hook.

, Life is about memories: a quick sketch of a bird or plant, a wishlist, a jot of the most important thought ever. A pad and pencil is also perfect for writing down a license plate at the scene of the crime, spying, or even writing the Great American Novel. Your pencil can also be sharpened with your knife.

, For when hair gets in the way (obviously). It can be used as a rubber band too. Or you can use your bandana or pencil.

, For strapping things on the go. It can be used for other purposes too, but that's pretty much it.

, Basic tool for sleep out and reading under the covers at night. A small piece of red cellophane make a good ghost story even creepier. A solar or shake-the-battery flashlight is good too, but always bring an extra pair of batteries if using a normal one. Eventually you can get a headlamp, so you have two useful hands.

, You need to know where you are, and a compass can help. Of course, you'll need to know how to use a compass too. Hang it around your neck with a whistle if your out exploring, hiking, etc.

, Because they're good to have on hand when things need to be put back together, when you want to express eternal friendship to an new pal by decorating with a few beads as a gift. Just make sure you don't poke yourself with them. When they say ""safety"" pins they aren't very accurate.

, Two inches wide and as hard as nails. Good for clubhouse construction. The list of things it can do would be too long for me to put here, so here's the scoop: used for almost anything.

, Old standbys, but not the most essential item (unless that book is a how-to book.)

, To carry your essential gear. No need for lots of pockets. Just something enclosed on the inside is fine. If you want, tie your bandana to a stick instead.

, It's a quality not a thing, but it's essential so we'll include it here. Forget perfect on the first try. In the face of frustration, your best tool is a few deep breaths, and remembering you can do anything once you've practicing two hundred times. Seriously.

Plan your hike.,
Dress appropriately to hike Mount Whitney.,
Pack the appropriate supplies to hike Mount Whitney.,
Hike Mount Whitney.",How to Hike Mount Whitney,"

If you intend to hike the mountain between May 1 and November 1, a permit is required.
Contact the Eastern Sierra InterAgency Visitor Center at (760) 876-6200 or see the Inyo National Forest Service website for details on how to obtain a permit. The rules for obtaining a permit vary depending on how long your hike will be and when you intend to embark on it.
The application to obtain a permit for the popular summer months must be submitted by February 15 to enter a lottery system, which is how the recipients of permits are determined.
You should receive a response with regard to the status of your permit application by early April.
Mt. Whitney may be approached from other trailheads north, south and west of the peak but all of the other trails involve several days of backpacking. Permits may be obtained through Inyo National Forest and Sequoia National Park.;
,

Learn about acute mountain sickness (AMS), how to recognize it and what to do if you develop symptoms. AMS is a very real concern, especially for those attempting to hike Mt. Whitney as a day hike. The risk of developing AMS can be reduced by staying at an intermediate elevation such as Whitney Portal for two nights prior to the hike.
Get as physically fit as you can. The hike is strenuous, with a large elevation gain, so start training several months before the hike. Try to hike steep hills and take long hikes to simulate the long hike to the summit.
Assemble your gear and make a checklist so you don't forget anything.

, It may be warm in the desert on the east side of the Sierra but at over 14,000 feet the temperature will be much colder and afternoon thundershowers are possible. Wear breathable synthetic, wool or down clothing, not cotton.


Wear sturdy hiking boots and synthetic or wool socks.
Bring warm pants and a rain jacket, even if it is warm and dry down below. Bring a lightweight down jacket or fleece for additional warmth.
Wear a hat to protect your head from the sun and/or keep your head warm in cold conditions. A baseball cap will suffice on warm days, but you should bring a fleece or wool hat in case it is cold at the top.
Wear sunglasses to protect your eyes from the sun.

,


Pack plenty of water. One gallon (3.79 L) should suffice, but pack extra if you typically become thirsty often during hikes. There are water sources along the way so bring a water filter or other purification method.
Pack a flashlight in case you have to hike at night, whether you intend to do so or not.






Pack a bear canister. This is a bear-resistant food-storage device that will help keep bears and other wildlife from eating your food.
For breakfast and lunch meals, pack foods with high amounts of carbohydrates. The human body breaks these down quickly and they will help fuel your body for your hike. Bring bland, easily digestible foods as your appetite may decrease at altitude.
For dinner meals, pack foods that contain plenty of fats and proteins. Fats help insulate the body for the lower night temperatures and proteins help rebuild the muscles and tissues that wore down during the day.
Pack a Wag Bag and toilet paper, as all solid human waste must be taken off the mountain with you.
Pack a sleeping bag and a tent if you plan to stay overnight.
Take a trail map and a compass or GPS device. The trail map will guide you during your hike and the compass or GPS device will help you navigate if you become lost.
Pack sun screen and insect repellent to protect yourself from the sun and insects.
Pack a first aid kit that includes bandaids and over the counter medications such as ibuprofen.
Pack an ice-axe and crampons if you are hiking during the winter. Crampons are traction devices that improve the ability to maneuver on snow or ice.

,


Mount Whitney is located east of Lone Pine, California off of US Highway 395. View directions on how to get there on the Internet or call (760) 876-6200 for directions.
Drive from Lone Pine to Whitney Portal, where the trail begins.
Stay on the trail at all times. Use your map to verify your location.
There is an elevation gain of 6,137 feet (1,870.56 m). If you develop symptoms of acute mountain sickness stop and evaluate whether you can go on, depending on the severity of symptoms, time of day and other factors.
The hike is approximately 22 miles (35.41 km) round trip.
Most people take 1 to 3 days to complete this hike.

Park at the old toll house trail head and pay the State Park entrance fee of $3.,
Choose between the two different trail options to the spot of the old halfway house.,
Hike up the gentle sloping Old Halfway House Trail (or Old Tollhouse Road) to the Halfway House.,
Reach the site of the historic Halfway House.,
After leaving Halfway House, the trail will quickly turn steeper.,
Climb till you reach above the timberline.,
Keep climbing past the false summit to the real summit.",How to Hike Mt. Monadnock Via the White Arrow Trail,";
, One option is to walk up the wide, gravel Old Tollhouse Road pictured here. Another option is to take the Halfway House Trail. Both routes are of approximately equal distance, over parallel areas, but the trail offers a more ""wilderness feel"" and is the more recommended route.

, You will pass a variety of deciduous trees and will see beautiful foliage if you do the hike in October.

, While the house is no longer there, the historical marker will remind you that you are about halfway in distance to the summit. That said, at this point the trail becomes much steeper and the real work is still ahead of you.

, At times it will be a staircase like series of rocks. As you climb, the trees will change from deciduous trees to evergreens till the point you eventually pass the timberline.

, The evergreen trees will give way to series of bushes and allow a view of the summit. While the summit looks tantalizingly close at this point, some relatively slow climbing over steep rock remains ahead.


At this point the trail becomes a bit less obvious and it helps to follow the white paint trail markings found on the rocks every 30 feet (9.1 m) or so.







, Enjoy the fantastic view.

Check weather reports before you travel, and learn to recognize warning signs of a potential downpour, such as thick, dark clouds that obscure the entire sky so completely that you can't see the sun.,
Carry the following with you in case of rain:

A waterproof, windproof, breathable jacket.,
Wear waterproof shoes or hiking boots.,
Purchase or create a rain cover for your hiking pack.",How to Hike in the Rain,"


If you're aware of the weather patterns, you can prepare yourself properly before starting your hike, then properly evaluate when or whether to turn back on the trail.;
, Not only does this keep the rain outside from penetrating in toward your body, but the breathable material also allows moisture from perspiration to escape, so you don't end up soaking wet from your own sweat. You can hike with a non-breathable jacket, too, but you'll have to either open under-arm zippers to vent excess body heat and moisture, or travel slowly to keep from getting sweaty. Otherwise, you defeat the point of wearing waterproof hiking gear anyway; you're already wet.






A broad-brimmed hat to help shed rain. A good hood on your rain jacket can substitute for a hat, but unless the hood has brim to keep water off your face, you might want to wear a ball cap beneath it.






Blowing rain, sitting on wet ground or wading through wet foliage can get your lower half wet, too. If you're going on a long hike or expect to encounter any of the conditions just mentioned, carry waterproof pants that you can slip on over your pants. You won't always need them, but you'll be glad to have them in case of heavy rain.






Dry socks. You'll be glad to have them to change into at the end of the hike, or even at the midway point if your feet are soggy.







, Hiking through mud or wet grass can quickly turn non-waterproof shoes into a squishy, miserable mess.


Avoid cotton socks; once cotton gets wet it stays wet, and loses most of its insulating power. Wool, treated silk and wicking synthetic materials are a much better choice.

,

You can also spray your pack with a waterproofing spray, but water can still seep through zippers and other fastenings, and spray-on waterproofing coatings tend to wear off relatively quickly.






Some packs come with a stowable rain cover built in. Check the bottom of the pack for a zippered or hook-and-loop compartment that might hold the rain cover.






You can improvise your own rain cover by placing a large garbage bag over your pack, with the opening facing down.

Schedule your hike when there are no expected thunderstorms. Lighting strikes are the number 1 cause of death on Half Dome.;
,


Bring enough clothing to account for the temperature reduction that you are likely to experience. The top of Half Dome is typically 15 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit (8 to 11 degrees Celsius) cooler than Yosemite Valley, which is where you will begin your hike.
Pack a bag to carry any recyclables or garbage, as there are no receptacles on the trail.
Bring plenty of water. It is suggested that you bring at least 1 gallon (3.79 L) of water if you plan to hike to the top of Half Dome.
Bring toilet paper and a bag or portable toilet.
There are scattered bathrooms on the trail, but solid bodily waste must be buried at least 6 inches (15.24 cm) below the surface and 100 feet (30.48 m) from any water or trails if you are unable to reach a bathroom in time. You must take any toilet paper you use with you.
Bring matches or another means of starting a fire in case you must spend the night outdoors.
Bring a flashlight in case you remain outdoors after nightfall.
Bring a first-aid kit with items that include pain killers (such as those you'd find over-the-counter in a pharmacy) and foot medication for blisters and sores.
Bring plenty of food. You will be exerting a lot of energy on this hike.
Bring a tent if you intend to spread the hike over multiple days.
Bring a map of the route you intend to take. Contact Yosemite National Park prior to leaving to verify that they have trail maps if you intend to get 1 while there.

,


Wear hiking boots that have strong ankle-support and traction. Doing so will help prevent blisters and ankle injuries.
Wear hiking gloves. These will be especially useful when hiking the last part of the trail, as you must use cables to climb the steep rock formation.
Wear a hat or other form of head protection. This will help with insect and solar protection.
Wear sunscreen and sunglasses to protect your skin and eyes.
Wear rain protection, such as a raincoat, if any inclement weather is expected.

,


Drive to Yosemite National Park and park near Curry Village. Ask a park employee for detailed directions if you are unsure how to get to Curry Village.
Board the shuttle bus and ask the driver to drop you off at stop 16, which is for Mist Trail/Half Dome.
Cross the bridge and turn right. Follow the dirt road to the end, which is where the trail begins.
Once you reach the next bridge, which should only take a few minutes, you will reach a fork in the trail.
Turn left if you want to take the shorter route (Mist Trail). Turn right if you want to take the longer route (Muir Trail).
Follow your trail map to navigate the trail that you choose. Follow all recommended safety precautions at all times.
Once you near the end of the trail, you will reach a steep incline that must be scaled using cables that are pre-installed for hikers. You do not need your own equipment.
Once you have reached the top of Half Dome, you have completed your ascent. Follow the trail back down using your trail map for a safe exit.

Do the Necessary Pre-Research: Before, you plan to come, do your research on the region you would like to visit for trekking and for that you may take help through different search engines on the internet that will provide you information regarding the area, local tours and guides.,
Know the Region: The Himalayan mountain chain is spread southeast to northwest across the Asian continent.,
Planning and Preparation: the first and foremost part is that you like hiking in the first place!,
Physical Condition: when you are planning to trek in Himalayas, it demands a degree of physical fitness in which muscles are conditioned to take the rigors of ascent and descent in long marches.,
Mental Condition: mental preparation is more complex than physical condoning.,
Preparation for the Trip: there are various factors to consider, both mental and physical, in preparation for the trip.,
Food and Fitness: first rule for anyone interested in trekking in the Himalayan region is that one must be good in physical and mental condition.,
Altitude Sickness: no other mountains deserve the kind of respect the Himalaya do in terms of altitude.,
The Trekker Medical Kit: should include wound disinfectants, band aids in different sizes, gauze pads and rolls, mosquito repellents if crossing malarial areas, thermometer, analgesics, and anti-inflammatory and other antibiotics as prescribed by a doctor from a travel clinic.",How to Go Trekking in the Himalayas," You can register with the region’s local licensed tour company to make your travel easier. The climate and geography is complex, so when considering your trip you need to plan carefully where to go, when to go and what your budget is.;
, In the east, the Himalaya originates from a knot between Myanmar, Tibet (now under China) and India. The chain continues to the border of Bhutan. Beyond that lies Sikkim, home to many peaks including the world’s third highest, Kangchenjunga. The Himalayan range west of Sikkim forms part of Nepal until you reach the border of Kumaun and Garhwal. From here the Indian Himalayan chain continues without a break through Kinnaur, Spiti, Ladakh and lastly East Karakoram range. Knowing the region may help you choose the suitable area for the trekking depending on the type of trekking terrains you want to choose.

, Consider some short hikes nearby home to develop basic fitness, start by walking slow in the beginning and gradually increasing your pace. Consider carrying a backpack, camping for days together, walking on rough trails, the different food. This will help you to select the trek best suited to you. walking alone or with few friends can be wonderful, though it is easier for the young as you need to put more than walking into your day. If you plan to camp out and cook, develop stamina. If you plan to stay in local homes or tea houses, than you must know the language a little, learn the basics like greeting and common phrases used by locals.

, A trek is enjoyed more if you are not particularly tired on reaching the camp after a day's march. Even if you are only moderately conditioned at the outset, it will not take more than 2 to 3 days to become almost fully conditioned after a week you will either be perfectly tuned or completely fed up, depending upon your mental and physical responses. Enjoy your walk keeping in tune with the demands of the land.

, The experience is likely to be a cultural surprise cum shock which you must learn to absorb. You need to adjust, at least temporarily, to the ways and responses of the people and sights encountered wherever you happen to travel. Only those read few books about the Himalayas will not acquaint you with the region from authentic sources. Most Europeans who have never visited India and Nepal before have wrong ideas and notions about the country. The initial experience - the heat, the noise and the street life, the vibrant colors and the multitudes of people - may bewilder and exhaust the first - time visitor, but the country and its people are friendly and hospitable. Once you have spent some time here everything will fall into place, and you will be amply rewarded with your first glimpse of the Himalayan peaks, one of the most spectacular mountain ranges in the world.

, : -


physical conditioning of the cardiovascular system with aerobic exercise.
background reading, maps etc.
wear warm clothes as climate in such higher altitude areas remain very cold throughout the year.
camping and cooking equipment: this depends on the style of trekking, but if you are totally equipping yourself then you could consider the following:
sturdy rain-proof tent.
sleeping bag with liner and foam mattress.
backpack, day pack and probably a duffel bag to keep in storage in hotels while on trek.
a kerosene stove that can be cleaned easily, a leak-proof fuel container, lightweight pots, pans and cutlery. Favorite food items.

, Good food is essential part of the trekking and here good food does not refer to costly delicacies but wholesome and nutritious diet. Choice of food is limited once you leave the town and head for wilderness. In many villages there are no food outlets and the trekkers have to be on their own for food. One should drink boiled water or tea mostly to avoid dehydration. However freshly cooked food has no substitute as tinned food losses its taste after some time. Trekkers should carry dry fruits, chocolates, sweets, soup packets, coffee powder, a biscuit, butter cheese, noodles etc.

, As the Himalayan Rescue Association likes to point out, 'The Himalaya starts where other mountains leave off.' Remember it is the sleeping altitude that is critical. If you ascend to an area of high altitude, you are likely to experience some form of altitude sickness. Usually, the symptoms are mild and will improve if you descend. What counts as high altitude? *high altitude refers to heights that are between 1,500 and 3,500m above sea level.*very high altitude is from 3,500 to 5,500m above sea level.*extreme altitude is from 5,500 to 7,500m above sea level. The way to prevent altitude sickness is to give the body enough time to get used to the rarefied air. A slow and steady ascent is vital. Adequate hydration is also helpful. The body is constantly losing fluid from the lungs and the skin in the high, dry environment. Drink enough to maintain a clear and abundant urine output. Other measures include eating a high carbohydrate diet, climbing high during the day and coming lower down to sleep, and to mild to moderate activity during the rather than just lie around. Almost all altitude problems can be avoided if symptoms are recognized and acted upon. The warning signs are headache, lack of appetite, nausea, feeling of tiredness, and sometimes vomiting. This stage of mild mountain sickness can be treated with aspirin or Diamox for headache and something mild for the nausea and vomiting.

, Always ask your doctor for advice and read the patient information that comes with your medicine.

Obtain an up to date map and plot your course according to your fitness and experience.,
Plan according to the season and what you intend to see.,
Consider how far you wish to travel.,
Pack supplies according to the weather and terrain.,
Organise & collaborate with your travel partners.,
Keep a close eye on the weather, and take notice of the weather reports as the weather in some areas is changeable and may prove unfavourable for long walks.",How to Go Bushwalking1," You can often source these maps online, either from the local Governments Website or from Bush-walking sites. Often bush-walking trails are clearly marked on the map with recommended rest or camp areas, points of interest and good vantage points for photography or scenic beauty.;
, The best time to visit the bush depends on the local area. Many states have wildflower tours and seasons when the bush is ablaze with colour. Its typically late spring, being late September through to November that is an ideal time for wildflowers, but pay attention to local climate. A mild winter will mean flowering will start much earlier.

, Many bush tracks can be less then a kilometre long so are a light stroll, some can be many kilometres long.

, A basic list would be:


Robust but comfortable walking boots with good grip are highly recommended, and better still if they are water-tight. The Australian bush varies in terrain from clay to sandy soils (both of which can be treacherous when wet and dry), as well as flat, hilly and/or mountainous. If you need to make a river crossing and there is no bridge, or you are travelling during the winter where there may be mud and deep puddles; gumboots or waders would be very useful.
Clothes to suit the landscape & climate. In the tropics, ticks and other parasites are happy to make a meal of you, so it is recommended that you wear leggings or trousers that breathe easily. In summer, the landscape of much of Australia is very hot and dry, it is important to include a hat and wear clothing to protect you from the sun. Popular hats also have net-veils sewn into them to keep flies and the sun away from your face. In cooler seasons, you can wrap a thin scarf (such as a linen cloth) around your nose and mouth to keep flies away. In winter, it can drop to freezing in southern or mountainous areas so it is wise to pack warm clothes, even if you are walking in the middle of the day. High visibility clothing is useful on long country treks.
Take adequate supplies. A bottle of water is essential, although fruit juice or other sports drinks are recommended for supplementing your energy.
Take medicines if necessary. A first aid kit is always useful on camps and long treks. Low odour insect repellent and sun blocking cream is highly recommended as well as antihistamines; Australian plants flower en-masse so people who suffer from allergies will be well advised to take some.
Pack hiking equipment. For short walks, you seldom need anything more than your map, but walking sticks, a compass, binoculars and a backpack are useful for longer journeys, especially where GPS (Global Positioning System) and other web based services will not get a signal.

, In practice, if you don't know the terrain, are going on a long journey (more than 2 km. in the hot season, or 5 km. in the cool season) or plan to camp in a National Park, you should travel with a partner as outside of the metropolitan areas, phone coverage is extremely limited.

, Some seasons are renowned for their heat and cold spikes and heavy rain in some districts can make areas dangerous.

"
"
Start early in the morning in the summer, or when the chance of frost has passed in the winter.,
Expect to encounter rocks and slopes if you walk in a hilly terrain.,
Treat any animal, reptile or insect you see with respect and caution.,
Observe any interesting flora.,
Enjoy the landscape.,
Keep an eye out for animal tracks.,
Remove all waste that you bring in to National Parks as there are very high fines for careless littering.",How to Go Bushwalking2," Advise people with whom you are staying that you are going on a walk and let them know where you are planning to walk.

, Sandy areas too may prove treacherous so walk carefully and at a steady pace. The fragile sands found in coastal and sand plain districts are similar to those of a beach so hikers will tire quickly if they strive to ""conquer"" the landscape. Pre-planning is a useful tool if you intend to stop at a scenic point for lunch or spend time painting, photographing or simply admiring the landscape, so you should gauge how long it should take you to get there at a slow and steady pace before you leave.

, Not all Australian animals are deadly, but even the ones that aren't can ruin your day if you get bitten. If you wish to observe them, approach quietly and give them space. In well walked areas, or districts that are close to towns, larger reptiles and animals are rare. You are more likely to see reptiles in the summer when they are active, but you may occasionally see one in winter sunning itself on a rock.

, Ideally do not touch them if you don't know what they are, for they may have small thorns or spines and / or have pollen or sap that can be irritating to the skin. Not all Australian flowers have perfume, but many do, including aromatic oils, so if you intend to smell them, do so carefully if you suffer from allergies. Be mindful that it is illegal to remove plants from a National Park.

, Be it waterfalls, striking rock monoliths or the peace and quiet. If you intend to sketch, paint, meditate or do some other activity such as bird watching, it is recommended that you visit on a quiet day (such as a weekday) when you are less likely to be disturbed.

, Generally, tracks are not always visible and Australia does not have many large predators such as wolves, bears, lions and tigers. But snake tracks can advise you to be alert. Most snakes and reptiles will move away from you if you make heavy stamping noises, but some snakes and lizards (called Goannas) can be aggressive and have been known to chase people.


Most wild animals will avoid humans but you may see them on your walk, particularly if you are walking deep into the outback areas. If you particularly wish to see larger animals such as Kangaroos, larger marsupials or reptiles it is highly recommended and much safer to visit a zoo or native animal sanctuary.

, Many bush fires have also been caused by stray cigarettes and cooking fires that have cost lives.

"
"
Contact people you know or call an Emergency Service Number.",How to Go Bushwalking3," In Australia, Dial 000 if you have a phone signal. Take special note of your starting point and the landscape and any landmarks along the way so that you can be clear when describing your location. Aim to locate yourself in a place where you will be visible from land and sky. In the outback a helicopter or the Royal Australian Flying Doctor Service may be your rescuers. If it is too hot to be in the sun, then use a landmark, your tent, or some high visibility clothing laid out for them to see. Common problems hikers experience are:


Dehydration or heat stroke. Symptoms often appear as headaches, fatigue, dizziness and feeling lightheaded. Rest in the nearest shade that is free from signs of animals. Drink water. Do not continue your hike until you feel safe to do so.
Sprained ankles and similar injuries. Wrap in a bandage or manufacture a bandage from existing clothing, a suitable fallen branch may suit as a splint, but you would be wise to pack for such contingencies if you are a long way away from other people. Slips and falls are very common with inexperienced or hasty bush-walkers, so it is recommended to be careful where you tread at all times.
Cuts and grazes. These are very likely when walking through dense scrub. All scratches should be treated with an antibacterial and anti-inflammatory cream. To avoid infection, always apply a band-aid after treatment. If the climate is suitable, wear jeans and long sleeved cotton tops as robust fabric is far more resistant to scratches.

Ask friends who hike often if they would recommend a certain trail or area for a hike during autumn. Many areas have hikes that are known to be beautiful during the fall and are advertised as the best for this season.You can also call the national park service in your area or state and ask them for recommendations. Check their website as well for a list of the best hikes for fall in the park.;
, A big part of going hiking in autumn is taking in the changing foliage on the trees. Go for an area that has a lot of trees or surrounding forest. You may also opt for a hiking trail that leads to a high view of forest or trees. Make sure the area you are hiking in has lots of greenery so you get the best views of the changing foliage.


You may look up images of the hike beforehand online to make sure it has a lot of forest or trees. Compare several images of several different hikes to determine which one will be the most stunning during autumn.

, When you are choosing a hike, you should also consider your skill level and your experience as a hiker. Most hikes will be categorized by skill level, ranging from novice or beginner hikers to advanced or experienced hikers. Go for the hike that will suit your skill level as well as the skill level of those you are hiking with. This way, everyone is hiking at their level and can enjoy the trail.For example, if you are hiking with young children, you may opt for a hike that is recommended for beginner hikers or is family friendly.
If you are hiking with a group of young adults who have done several hikes before, you may go for a more advanced hike that gives you access to a lot of forest and trees.

, Before you head out for the hike, you should always check the weather forecast for the day of the hike. Autumn can be an unpredictable time weather wise, as temperatures can fluctuate throughout the day, depending on where you are located. Check your local weather forecast and note if there are any advisories for poor weather in the area you are planning to hike.You should also look up the conditions of the trail you are planning to hike. Look online for the trail conditions for the hike the night before or the day of the hike. Note if there are any advisories for the trail, such as an avalanche warning for the trail or a trail closure.
You can also call your local park service to check on the condition of a trail before you head out. They can often tell you if you should be concerned about going on a particular trail.

, Hiking in autumn means you may experiences shifts in temperature throughout the day. Be smart and dress in layers so you can shed them as you sweat or put more layers on when you start to get cold. Wear long pants and hiking shoes with socks that go over your pants so your legs are covered. This will prevent tick bites and ensure you stay warm during the hike.You should also wear lightweight, breathable clothing that is made of non-wick material and avoid cotton, as you do not want your sweat to dry on you as this could make you feel cold.
Bring a raincoat just in case it rains during the day and to keep you warm if you start to get cold on the trail.

, Put together a hiking kit that includes all the essentials, such as a firestarter, matches, a first-aid kit, a flashlight, and a pocket knife. You should also bring sunscreen and a compass that you can use in the event you get lost. Put all these items together in your hiking backpack so they are on hand in the event you need them.You may also get hiking poles to help you navigate the trail more easily. Hiking poles may be ideal if you are going on an autumn hike that has steep sections or areas.
You should pack a small camera in your hiking kit to ensure you get good shots of the stunning autumn scenery. Make sure the camera is secure in your bag and on you when you take it out on the trail so it does not get damaged.

, You should also pack a hiking backpack that contains snacks for the day. Bring easy snacks like sliced fruit, sliced cheese, and crackers. You may also pack granola bars and energy bars so you can stay energized during the hike. Try to bring enough food for everyone in your group so you can all sit down at some point during the hike and have a snack.You should also bring a full water bottle with you. Make sure each person in your group has their own water bottle so you can all stay hydrated during the hike.

, You should bring a tarp or a cover that could work as emergency shelter. Even if the weather for the day is supposed to be clear, you never know when the weather can turn during the fall. Having emergency shelter will ensure you are covered in the event it rains hard and you are stuck on the trail.You may also bring some rope or bungee cords that you can use to secure the tarp or cover over some trees to make a shelter.

, Hiking with at least one other person or with a group of people will ensure you are all safe on the trail. Enlist some friends to go with you on an autumn hike or invite your family along. Hiking in a group can also be a fun way to bond and enjoy the stunning views with others.Hiking alone is not advised, even if you are a seasoned hiker.
When you hike as a group, you should all try to go at the same pace. The pace of the hike should be tailored for the slowest hiker in the group. This will allow you to all stay together. You should start and end the hike as a group.

, Tell friends or family who are not going on the hike with you where you are hiking, when you are starting out on the hike, and when you plan to be back. Letting others know will ensure you are covered in the event of an emergency. If you do not contact the person you tell, they can then alert the park authorities and make sure you get home safe.There are Apps on your phone that you can download and use to check in with others before you go hiking. You could then check back in once the hike is over to confirm you are safe. If you do not check back in, the App can then alert others who can check on you.

, In many areas, autumn is the hunting season. You may end up sharing the trail with hunters who are hunting for elk, deer, and other game. Be aware of the presence of others on the trail, from hunters to other hikers. Greet other hikers on the trail and make eye contact. Step aside for hikers who are coming down the trail you are climbing and make room others on the trail.You should also be aware of the needs of those you are hiking with. If you notice everyone in your group is tired and the weather starts to turn, for example, it may be time to turn back. Be willing to turn back and try again another day if you feel it would not be safe to continue.

, The skull plate should be sitting on your table so that you can take horizontal and vertical measurements of the rack. You will need to take all measurements to the nearest one-eighth inch.

, This is the distance between the tip of the right antler and the tip of the left antler. Take the measurement from the front of the antlers.


Write down all your measurements on your score sheet or using the Boone and Crockett Club online form.
This is usually a small measurement, because the main beams reach toward each other in the middle of the rack.

, This is the distance between the widest point of the left antler to the widest point of the right antler. This horizontal measurement can be taken along any point of antlers along the main beam.

, Measure the horizontal distance between the widest curve of the main beam on each side.

, Start at the burr, where the antlers meet the skull. Twist your flexible measuring tape so that it follows the center of the lowest outside edge of the main beam over the outer side to the end of the main beam.


Start with the right antler, and then do a separate measurement for the left antler.
Antlers are not perfectly symmetrical.

, Typical/normal points are those extending from the top of the main beam. Abnormal points can extend from the main beam near the burr., This should be fairly easy and short, unless your deer’s antlers are extremely abnormal.

, The Boone and Crockett Club scoring sheet has places for up to seven points, although few deer will have that many. Repeat with the points on the left antler.


Each point will have a separate box in which to write the measurement.

, This is the narrowest point between one location and another. Use a flexible measuring tape to wrap in a circle around that point, or use a flexible steel cable and then lay it out across a yardstick to determine the measurement.

, Make sure you are choosing the narrowest point. Repeat on the left.

, Do the right and then the left.

,,, Confirm that you have followed fair game rules when hunting the deer.

, In order to be entered into their awards program, you will need to contact a local Boone and Crockett Club and have an Official Measurer score your antlers.You can also submit your score to your state agency for special consideration or awards.

Purchase good boots.,
Wear the right socks.,
Cut the toenails before leaving home.,
Tie the boots well.,
Keep an eye on the tightness of your shoelaces.,
Keep your feet dry.,
Keep ankles flexed.",How to Fix Hiking Shoes for Safe and Comfortable Hiking," This one goes without saying, really. You should do the research, get fitted properly, and purchase hiking boots that suit the type of hiking you are doing.;
, Socks that ride down into the shoe, prevent proper breathing, or are just plain itchy, will make your hiking experience a misery. Purchase good quality hiking socks, preferably those made specifically for the purpose. There are many to select from to suit any budget. Some hiking socks have in-built padding and special features accompanying them; seek advice from the sales assistant or the manufacturer's online website.

, There is nothing more uncomfortable than long toenails on a hiking trip. Deal with them before you even embark on the trip so that they won't be creating holes in your socks and causing you pain as the boot knocks them into your toe skin. Ouch!

, If your laces are always undoing, chances are that you have laces that have a slippery covering. Solve the problem at the start by tying a double knot.

, As you hike, your laces tend to loosen. It is always a good idea to check the tension of your laces before commencing a descent. Retying the shoelaces to tighten them again will help prevent such problems as slipping feet and toes banging against the front of the boot.

, If you know you are hiking somewhere that your boots might get wet, place plastic bags over your socks before putting on the boot. If the unbearable happens and your boot gets completely wet, your feet stay dry. Or, if your boots are wet from a day of hiking, put the plastic bags over your dry socks the next morning so that the wet boots don't create wet feet.

, Some hiking boots with high backed supports prevent your ankle from flexing as you walk uphill. To prevent your shin from being rubbed raw, loosen the top laces or tie only the second-to-top eye. You can tighten the laces again on flat or downhill surfaces.

Read the hunting laws in your state.,
For example, a state like Alabama requires hunters to get permission from private landowners in every situation before hunting can take place.,
Post your property.,
Fence in your property.,
Discourage wildlife from coming onto your property.,
Be active on your land.,
Tell hunters to leave.,
Call the law enforcement non-emergency line.,
File an online report.,
Call the police emergency line.,
Follow up as necessary.,
Analyze your state’s hunting laws.,
Require permission in advance of a hunt.,
Create restrictions if necessary.,
Keep records of everything.",How to Report Trespassing Hunters," Every state has statutes determining criminal and civil liability for individuals that improperly go onto another person's private property. In addition, each state's trespassing laws will dictate how hunters can and cannot interact with privately owned land. While every state is different, there are some common themes that will help you decide what you need to do to legally keep hunters off your property.;
,


In a state like Minnesota, hunters can enter onto private land for the purpose of hunting unless the land has been posted, the land is agricultural in nature, or if you have explicitly told the hunter to leave.
In Florida, a hunter can be charged with trespassing for simply firing a projectile (i.e., a bullet) across your private property.
In many states (e.g., Minnesota) there are exceptions to trespassing laws that allow hunters to enter onto your land in certain situations. Often, these exceptions allow hunters to retrieve wounded wildlife or a hunting dog., If you are required to post your property in order to keep hunters out, you must place signs or leave signals that tell possible hunters they are not allowed. If your state requires you to post, you need to follow the requirements set out in the law. For example, in Minnesota, you must place signs at 1,000 foot (300 m) intervals (500 foot intervals in wooded areas) that state ""no trespassing"" or similar words. The letters on the signs must be at least two inches high and the sign must have your contact information on it. You may also post signs at every corner of your property as well as at every property access point.In other states, for example Virginia, posting can be accomplished by painting an aluminum colored line at least two inches in width and eight inches in length on posts on your property boundaries.Most states that require posting will require you to complete this task once per year.

, Some states consider a fence to be another adequate indication that your land is not to be hunted on. For example, in California and West Virginia, hunters cannot enter onto private land for the purpose of hunting if a fence has been erected around it.Even if your state's laws do not identify fencing as an adequate indication, putting one around your property is a great way to deter hunters from coming onto your land.

, If wild game is not likely to be found on your property, hunters will not want to visit. Therefore, if you can keep deer, pheasant, duck, or any other wild game off your private property, you will disincentivize hunters from trespassing. To do this, remove as many wild game attractions as possible. For example, deer eat hostas and other plant life that you might plant in your gardens or elsewhere on your property. If you keep deer food off of your property, they will be less likely to wander in.


Also, in many states, it is illegal to purposefully feed wild game on your property., A lot of hunters will use private land when there is no activity on it and they do not know how to contact the landowner. However, if you are present on your land regularly, hunters will most likely stay off your land or at least ask for your permission to hunt there. Try things like spending time outside, keeping your property presentable and clean, and having lights on in dwellings. If you do not live on the land you are having problems with, go there at least once a week if possible and walk around.

, If you find a hunter on your private land, you should ask them to leave immediately. If no damage has been caused by the hunter, it is usually best to tell him or her that they are on private property that does not allow hunting. Most hunters will respect you and leave your property right away. If they do, this simple conversation may end your trespassing problem without having to involve law enforcement.


In states that allow hunting on private land without permission, you may actually be required to tell the hunters to leave before you can take any legal action against them. For example, in Minnesota, if you do not post your land and it is not agricultural, a hunter can legally hunt there without your permission. However, if you ask the hunter to leave, that hunter is not allowed to return to your land for one year.In addition, a lot of law enforcement agencies will be reluctant to press charges against a trespassing hunter that has not caused any damage, unless that hunter has been asked to leave at least once before., If hunters return after being asked to leave, or if your property is properly posted, you might choose to call your local law enforcement agency's non-emergency line to report the trespassing. By using the non-emergency line, you are avoiding taking valuable law enforcement resources away from other crimes that may be occurring. Also, you will be engaging the trespasser in a less adversarial way.


The non-emergency line is also a great tool if you do not catch the trespasser in the act and there is no ongoing emergency to report. For example, if you go to your land and you see trash, shotgun shells, and/or bullet casings, but you do not see the hunter, you may choose to call the non-emergency line to report the crime.
When you call the non-emergency line, you will be asked to give a detailed description of the trespasser, what they were doing, and when it occurred. If you did not see the trespasser, you may be asked to identify what leads you to believe someone was on your land (e.g., tire marks, shell casings, etc.). When the phone call is completed, an official report will be created and a law enforcement officer will usually visit you within a few hours. Work with the official in order to get them as much information as possible about the trespassing.

, If you do not want to call the non-emergency line, you can usually file a non-emergency report online with your local law enforcement agency. Usually, these reports can only be filed in certain instances and for certain crimes. Be sure you check with your local law enforcement agency to ensure this is a valid option for you.


For example, in Gwinnett County, Georgia, you can submit an online complaint if the trespassing took place in that county, there are no known suspects, and there is no physical evidence. If you meet these requirements, you can click on the report button that corresponds to criminal trespass. You will then be asked to supply as much information as possible then submit the report., You should only call 9-1-1 if the hunter is currently trespassing on your land and is posing a danger to you, your family, or your property. For example, if the hunter is pointing his or her firearm toward your home or toward your livestock (if you live on a farm), you may want to call 9-1-1. When you call 9-1-1, calmly explain what is happening and ask that a law enforcement member be dispatched to the area immediately. When law enforcement arrives, let them handle the trespasser and do not engage until asked to do so.

, Once you have used any of the methods to report trespassing hunters, be sure you follow up whenever necessary to ensure the problem does not persist. If you handled the matter on your own, be sure you take the time to visit your land and make sure the trespasser has not returned. If you have involved local law enforcement, keep track of their progress and make sure you are willing to take the steps necessary to ensure the problem will not occur again. If law enforcement is pursuing criminal charges, you may be asked to testify against the hunter in court.


If a hunter is found guilty of criminal trespass, he or she will usually pay a fine and have their hunting license revoked for a period of years.
If a hunter is found liable for civil trespass, he or she will usually have to pay damages., Allowing hunters to use your land can be a positive experience for both parties. Hunters can be an important piece of the conservation puzzle, they may be willing to pay lease fees to use your land, and they may clean up your land while they are hunting.Depending on the state you live in, permitting hunters to hunt on your land may need to be done explicitly or permission may be implied. If you live in a state where posting is required to keep hunters off your land (e.g., Minnesota), permission may be implied if you do not post. However, if you live in a state where permission is always required (e.g., Alabama), hunters will need to speak with you before they can hunt on your land.


Make sure you know what type of state you live in so you can help hunters access your land during hunting season.

, If you are going to allow hunting on your land, consider posting signs around your property that ask hunters to contact you before entering your land. By doing this, you can control how many hunters are on your property at any one time and you can make sure everyone on your land is in a safe environment. For example, if you know there are hunters on your property on a specific day, you can stay off the property and keep others away. This will ensure nobody is hurt by rogue gunfire or other accidents.


Some states have forms that hunters can fill out and bring to you. These forms are a great way to keep track of hunting activities on your property. When a hunter uses one of these forms, they will fill it out and bring it to you prior to hunting on your land. The form will include where your property is located, when the hunter can hunt, and any restrictions you place on their activities. You should keep a copy for yourself and the hunter is required by law to carry it with them whenever they are on your land., Restricting what hunters can do on your land is a great way to create a safe hunting environment and will ensure wild game are hunted responsibly. For example, you might dictate that hunters can only take a certain amount of wildlife each day. You might also dictate the type of wildlife a hunter can take (e.g., antlerless elk). Finally, and maybe most importantly, you might restrict where hunters can hunt. While the law requires hunters to stay a certain distance from dwellings, you might ask that hunters stay even further back from your home or barns. Also, if you have multiple people hunting your property on the same day, you should tell each party where the other will be hunting and where each party is able to go.

, Each year you should keep a file for all of the hunting related materials you receive from hunters. This will include permission cards, written letters, notices, and anything else you get. This information may become important if you have a dispute with a hunter regarding their use of your land. The more information you have the stronger your case will be.

Wrap the cable around the antler between the second and fourth points.,
Give information on your name, personal information and the location the deer was found to submit it for official scoring.",How to Score Mule Deer Antlers," It usually takes about 60 days to dry the antlers.;
, This is only necessary if you are trying to make it into the Boone and Crockett official records.

, Hover over the tab entitled “Big Game Records.” Scroll and select “Scoring Your Trophy.”

,,, You can use a ¼-inch steel measuring tape for the straight measurements. Then, you should place a yardstick down and use a flexible steel cable to wrap around the circumference of the antlers.


You will lay the flexible steel cable out across the yardstick to find the exact circumferences.
Measurements should be taken to the eighth of an inch.

, The points must be one inch (2.5cm) or more from the tip of the point to the edge of the beam. Enter the number of points on the left antler and the number of points on the right antler.

, These are any points originating from the bottom or sides of the beams, outside of the normal five points per antler.

, There should be spaces from one to four. Any additional points can be tallied in the abnormal points section.


The tips of the main beams are not considered points in the same sense.

, There should be five spaces on each side for abnormal point lengths. If there are more, you can add them together with the point lengths in the final space.

, These often loop inward off of the front of the beams. This is called the tip-to-tip spread and it is the inner space between the tips of the main beams.

, Measure the space between the outermost points of the antlers on each side. It can be measured across the main beams or points, depending upon which is wider.

, This is the inside area between the beams, not the tips, from left to right.

,, Wrap it around the thickest point and mark it with your thumb until you can measure it against the yardstick.


Repeat on the left antler.

, Write it down and repeat on the left side.

Tighten the shoulder straps until they are flush with your upper back.,
Snap the load lifter strap into place.,
Walk around in the store.",How to Fit a Backpack," Use a fabric measuring tape to determine the circumferences of your natural waist. This number will correspond with the backpack belt.;
, Start at the base of your neck at the seventh cervical vertebra and continue along your spine until you reach the iliac crest. The iliac crest is the top front of your hip, and you will need to show your helper where the level of the iliac crest is on your spine with your fingers.


Find the seventh cervical vertebrae by standing up straight. Tuck your head forward. The neck vertebra that sticks out the farthest is your seventh cervical vertebra.
The iliac crest is a bump at the side of your hip. It is not the top of your hip on your back. This bump is farther forward in women, and usually at the direct side of the hip in men.
Place your hand on your hip, between your thumb and forefinger, to mark the line of the iliac crest for the helper., Men with slender frames can get a better fit with a woman’s pack than with a men’s pack.

, Women with broader chests or shoulders can get a better fit with a unisex pack, because women’s fit packs tend to have a narrower shoulder construction.

, You may need to get a replacement shoulder harness, so look for a pack that allows you to replace belts and harnesses.

, It is unlikely standard packs will adjust to accommodate you comfortably.

,,, A waist 28 inches or smaller needs a small or extra small belt. A waist over 36 inches will need an extra large belt.


You may want to test medium and large belts for comfort if you are in between this range.

, Pick a pack and ask the associate to help you test it.

, (9 kg) of weight into the pack. Most outdoor stores have sandbags that will allow you to test weight without taking too much time packing individual gear in the pack., You don’t want them to be cinched up until you start putting the pack on your back., Lean forward and allow the pack to spread across your back. Tighten the shoulder straps slightly., Cinch it tightly. You want the majority of the weight to rest on your hips.


Tighten the hip belt stabilizers, if the pack has them. They are smaller straps that fit the belt more snugly.

, There should be no gaps above or behind the shoulders.You can stand sideways in a mirror to assure of good fit.


If you can’t get the shoulder straps to be tight and comfortable, the torso is likely too long for you. If the torso length is adjustable, take the pack off again and change the length.
If the shoulder straps lift the weight off your hips, they are either too tight or your torso length is too small., It is usually located on the chest between the front of the shoulder straps. They should be at a 45-degree angle with the shoulder strap.


Tighten the load lifters as needed.

, Lean slightly forward as you walk, just as if you were on the trail. If the straps dig in or feel off-balance, try another pack.

",How to Pack for a Fishing or Hunting Trip," You should also take into account the season planned for your trip.


Know if your destination is prone to sudden weather changes, such as in the mountains. You may have to pack extra clothing and gear in these instances.;
, A few items of warm clothing and rain gear should be packed, even if it is supposed to be warm.


If it is a day trip, you will only need spare clothing for that day. If you are planning a 2- or 3-day trip, you will need at least two days of clothing.

, Remember to do this early, because licenses can be in high demand.

, If you will be fishing from a boat, check local laws for boat safety equipment you may need.


Check with an experienced hunter for the correct firearms and ammunition for the type of game you will be hunting. You can also bring call whistles or other hunting aids.

, You should also include an emergency weather radio and a first aid kit.

, You don't want any flesh sticking to the skull, as it will rot, smell, and attract bugs. There are a few different ways to take care of this:


Using beetles. Skin the skull and remove as much flesh as possible. Place the skull in a terrarium with dermestid beetles to let them eat the flesh. The terrarium should be large enough to hold the bone and antlers, and covered. You can acquire a colony kit from a taxidermy supplier, or borrow some from a taxidermist's colony. Once the beetles have eaten the skull clean, rinse it off and brush with a soft wire brush to remove the last bits. Keep the skull wet with some occasional misting, and keep the terrarium in a dark place.Use simmering water. You'll need a large pot and a propane heater. Do this outdoors, or in your garage, as it will definitely smell. Heat the water to a simmer, and submerge the bone into the pot. Make sure the antlers do not get into the water, or if any of them do, wrap in tinfoil to prevent from getting wet. The process may take several hours, or all day.Using maceration. First, clean the skull plate yourself to remove as much meat as possible. Place in a bucket of water, and let it sit outdoors for anywhere from a week to a couple of months to grow bacteria. You shouldn't need to heat the water as long as you don't expect the temperature to dip below freezing. Some people like adding things like baking soda to speed up bacteria growth, but that isn't necessary. Keep an eye on the water, and if it gets too murky with meat tissue, change out most of it.Leaving it outdoors. Allow the skull to sit in the sun for several weeks for the growth of bacteria and insects. If you do this, you'll need to protect the bone with a plastic bag or some chicken wire, and firmly attach it somewhere to prevent other creatures from picking at or running off with it. Make sure you check every few days to see when the meat is falling off.

, After letting nature or water do the heavy lifting, you'll want to get the last bits of meat out. Rubbing the bone with some Borax and a wire brush should get the trickiest parts if anything is left., Place the skull or skull plate in a non-metal container with hydrogen peroxide. 40% volume, available at beauty stores, is the better option than the 3% you'll get at grocery or drug stores. Again, avoid submerging the antlers or wrap them in foil to keep their natural color. Cover the container and let sit for 12 hours (with 40% peroxide) or a few days (3% peroxide).This will give the bone a clean, white look. If you aren't displaying the bone openly, or prefer the more natural color, you can skip this step.

, You can mount antlers using other mediums, but wood is customarily used because its natural, elegant appearance. Pine, oak, walnut, and cherry all are fine examples of mounting woods. Choose wood with appealing grains.Purchase a plank with a thickness between 1 inch by 6 inches (2.54 cm by 15.24 cm) and 1 inch by 20 inches (2.54 cm by 50.8 cm). It is not advised to mount antlers on wood planks thinner than 1 inch by 6 inches. Determine the length and width of the plank to purchase by doubling the size of the skull plate.

, Sketch the shape of your plaque on a piece of paper. The style and construction of your mounting plate is completely up to you. Just make sure the finished size is large enough to mount the skull on. Once you have a good design, trace it onto your wood.One good way to get a good, symmetrical pattern is to trace one half of your design on the side of a closed manila folder, using the folded edge as your center. Cut out the tracing, and when you open up the folder, you will have a perfectly symmetrical pattern to trace on your wood., Using a scroll saw or jig saw, cut out the shape of your plaque. After you have finished cutting, sand the edges for a smoother finish.

, Find a stain appropriate to your choice of wood, based on its hardness. Clean off any dirt or grease, and sand to smoothness. Apply the wood stain generously across the whole surface of the wood, following any directions as given by the product. Let the wood absorb the stain, then set somewhere to dry for 6 to 8 hours. You can also apply a polyurethane finish for some extra shine to the plaque.You'll want to choose the right color, which depends on the wood you use and the antlers you are mounting. You want the stain to help highlight the antlers, so use a light to medium stain for dark antlers, and a darker stain on light-colored antlers.Follow the direction of the grain when applying wood stain to make the grain visible.

, This will either be two or three holes depending on the size of your skull plate. Place the holes where you want the skull plate to sit on the plaque. Near the top or in the middle of the plaque are the best places., Use the thickest part of the skull plate, as that will be the sturdiest part to hold the mount in place. These will need to match the size and position of the holes on the plaque., Insert drywall screws into the holes you just made, and into the holes you've drilled in the plaque. These should be strong enough to hold the antlers in place., You can use leather, felt, velvet, silk, or rubber to cover the skull plate. When you cut the material to cover the plate, make sure to add an extra half-inch around to wrap over the edges of the skull. Make sure to cut holes for the antlers as well. Stretch around the plate to cover the part that will face out, and secure on the back with tacks or staples.You can switch the order between this and the previous step. If you secure the antlers to the plaque first, and can't wrap around the back, use decorative brass tacks and nails to hold the covering in place., Display your work proudly, somewhere to remind you of a good hunt or to impress guests. Make sure you use a sturdy hanging tab, or a flush holding bracket, to keep the plaque in place on your wall."

Choose a sturdy noose material, preferably wire.,
If you don't have wire, use string or cord.,
If you don't even have string or chord, consider the tools nature gave you.,
Scout out the area.,
Pick your ""engine.""",How to Make a Snare Trap1," To build a noose, the most effective material to use is wire.You can use anything as long as it's flexible and not too thin or brittle. It must quickly and easily tighten. There are a number of wire types you can choose from:


Craft wire
Headphone wire
Stripped wires from cars
An uncoiled spring;
, Make sure it's strong enough to hold a small (5-8 lbs; 2.5-3.5 kg) animal. If it snaps under your own strength, it probably won't work. The following items are suitable for a snare trap if you don't have or can't find wire near you.


Shoelaces
Dental floss
Fishing line

, That means stringy tree bark and plant fibers. It's going to be more work, but if primitive cultures did it, so can you.


Milkweed
Dogbane
Cattail, A snare can be used day or night, rain or shine, and in any climate. All you need to make sure of is that animals pass by more than once in a blue moon. Placing random snares with no eye for signs of small game is a waste of time.


Look for signs of game in droppings, shelters, tracks, scratches, and signs of feeding.
A significant source of water and food for the area is a safe bet as well.

, Now that you've found the general area you want to build your snare in, look above you. What sort of trees do you have to work with? The tree will be the beef of your machinery.


Find a sapling (a young tree) that is strong enough yet bendy. Keep in mind, it must be able to hold the game high in the air until you find it.
If no saplings are around, look for a large tree limb and decent-sized rock. This is an alternate method that uses the same idea but doesn't require a bendable, well-placed sapling.

If you completed the first part of the test, wait for your instructor to assign you a partner.,
You and your partner will progress through an obstacle course, while demonstrating proper gun and hunting safety as the instructor(s) watch.",How to Pass a Washington State Hunting Education Test," You can contact the state-provided Department of Fish and Wildlife class online.;
, Your instructor will provide a lesson each day, and you must memorize the key elements.

, These are vital, and you will need to perform them exactly.

, You will need to learn the types of game available in your area, areas that are off-limits, the parts of a hunting rifle, how to safely hold and fire a weapon, and basic gun safety.

, The first part will be written, the second will be demonstrated.

, You will be given a date and time. Arrive in appropriate hunting clothes (with a family member if you are under 18).

, You will be given a real gun. Once you reach the end, return the gun to the instructor. Within the week, if you passed, you will receive your Washington hunter education certificate.

Carve a mouth, or hook, into two sticks.,
Plant the base into the ground.,
Tie your cord around a bendable sapling.,
Attach the other end of your cord to the hook.,
Tie a noose to the bottom of the hook.,
Arrange your noose.",How to Make a Snare Trap2," Think of linking your own hands together (fingernails tucked into the other hand) and pulling your elbows apart. That is the tension you'll be using.


The base should be longer than the hook and a bit sturdier.
The hook can be small--as long as it fits into the mouth of the base.

, It is easier to drive into the ground if you carve it into a peg shape first. The point breaks the soil much more quickly.


The base should be very close to the sapling you scouted out; the two will work in tandem.

, Make a knot that will not come off, even under tension. It should be about 6-12 inches (15-30 cm) from the top, depending on the strength of the sapling.


Test it before you assume it's sturdy. Remember: the animal will be struggling.

, Place the hook in mouth of base. Right now, the base should be the only thing preventing the hook from flying up into the air and the sapling straightening out.


Make sure your cord is the proper length. When the hook is in place, the sapling should be bent towards a 90 degree angle. When the hook is removed, it should straighten up again (dangling the animal).

, Again, make sure the knot is securely in place. At this point, the hook should have two cords attached: one to the noose and one to the sapling.

, The snare is in place. All that's left is arranging a noose, filling it with bait, and snaring your game.


Make the noose wide enough that it won't miss your target. You can spread it out on the ground with small twigs or pebbles; they won't interfere with it flying up when the animal is caught.

Hammer down two sticks into the ground.,
Hammer down a third, peg-shaped stick.,
Tie a thin stick underneath the arms of the first two sticks.,
Tie your string around a nearby sapling.,
Attach a small stick at the end of your wire.,
Place a stick between the peg and small stick on the wire.,
Tie a noose underneath the trigger system to the smallest stick.",How to Make a Snare Trap3," They should both be shaped like a one armed man and roughly two feet apart (.6 m).


Carve them into peg shapes beforehand to drill them into the ground more easily.
Place their ""arms"" parallel to each other. You will use the armpits as a source of support for the necessary tension.

, It should be, again, two feet or so apart from the other two, forming a triangle.


This stick does not have to be any particular shape but semi-straight.

, Using your same wire, make sure the stick is securely in place in the armpits of the two original sticks.

, Just like in the hook method, it should be 6-12 in (15-30 cm) from the top, depending on the strength of the tree.


Test everything before you assume it's secure. A struggling animal will not go easy on your trap.
Tie your wire around a rock and throw over a sturdy tree limb if easier or more convenient. The rock should dangle above the ground and emulate the same methods used with the sapling.

, This is your trigger point. Knot your wire and then knot it again.


A stick that is around 4 in (10 cm) is long enough. Hold it under the stick that's in the armpit of the first two, wire tugged tight in front. It uses the tension between the cord and armpitted stick to stay where it is when propped up.

, This will be the stick that gets hit, falls, and pulls up the sapling. It is propped up between the smallest stick and the peg, just waiting for trouble.


This is a balancing act. Make sure it's centered near perfectly or a breeze could knock it off kilter.

, The noose will follow the small stick flying in the air when an animal walks across its path.


Use small pebbles or twigs to widen the noose, lowering the possibility of your target just tripping the snare and escaping.
Place your bait within the noose. Choose whatever bait appeals to the type of game you are aiming to catch.

Find a sapling near the water's edge.,
Follow the hook trigger method.,
Tie one end of your line to the hook and place the baited line in the water.",How to Make a Snare Trap4," Test it for strength and flexibility. Try to see if fish seem to venture close to the area.

, You will need two sticks with carved out mouths and several feet of wire. The only difference between this method and the hook trigger method is that you must make sure the soil is compact and will not erode away while your trap is waiting for its target.

, Instead of a noose, you will be using your baited line to catch fish. The bait dangles in the water and the top of your line rests on the hook, ready to fly into the air upon even the slightest of tugs.


Make sure algae or seaweed won't mess up your trap. Try to clear the area of any needless shrubbery that could trigger your snare unnecessarily.

Gather plenty of newspaper or a very large plastic bag to lay the pheasant on.,
Know the two types of feathers you will encounter and how to deal with them.,
Hold the skin in place with your supporting hand whenever pulling out feathers.,
Start by removing the long, thick tail feathers one at a time.,
Work on the wings next, pulling 1-2 feathers at a time.,
Pull off the back feathers slowly by working against the grain.,
Using the same strategy as used on the back feathers, move on to the breast.,
Remove the thick feathers around the neck, and under the wing one at a time.,
Carefully remove the last bits of feather around the feet, neck, and tail.,
Optionally, hang pheasants for 3-4 days before plucking to make processing easier.",How to Pluck a Pheasant1," This is a very messy process, so lay out a nice area to work on that you can easily clean later. Have a trash bin handy to put the plucked feathers in while plucking., Pheasants have two types of feathers, each of which come out a little differently. Be ready for them to avoid any surprises and ugly plucked pheasants.



Thick, quill-like feathers are found along the neck, sides of the breast, and flanks. They should be removed 1-2 at a time.

Thin, wispy ""under-feathers"" are found along the body, and come out relatively easily, even in bunches., Don't let the skin of the bird pull with the feathers, as this will rip it and lead to an ugly, ungainly roast bird. Instead, use the hand holding the bird to keep the skin in place around the area where you are plucking.


Slow down even more around pellet holes from hunting or joints -- these areas are often the softest and most prone for rips.
This should slow you down as you pluck. Pheasants have delicate skin, and you need to work slowly to get a nice bird., These feathers will take a bit of effort to get out, but work slowly for the best results. Hold the bird under your arm, tucked against your ribs for support, and pull in the direction the feather is pointing. You want a quick, forceful yank to get the feather out, not a gradual pull.


If you're struggling to remove feathers, think about the direction you're pulling in. You want to pull hard in the direction the feather is going, but at the last minute you can pull upwards a bit, away from the pheasant, to get some extra power., Again, work slowly here, using a strong, quick yanking motion in the direction of the feather. Do not try and grab a handful of feathers and remove them all at once -- this usually leads to ripped skin or wings.


The wing are the deepest quills, and often take most effort.

, Start near the tail, grabbing only 2-3 feathers at once. This time, pull the feathers off by yanking up towards the head of the pheasant, opposite the natural direction of the feathers. You only want to pull a few feathers at once, as pheasant skin is thin and this motion can quickly rip the bird to shreds., Again, work in small areas, going slowly and holding the skin in place as you work. These are the thinnest, easiest feathers and will likely come off easily., These are the thickest feathers and some of the softest skin, so work slowly. Make sure you keep the skin in place to prevent large rips.While it seems counter-intuitive, a rapid, forceful yank will protect the bird much better than a slow, gradual pull.

, There should be some more thin under-feather around the bird, so simply rotate the pheasant and pluck away any last feathers you find. Remember to go slowly, especially in these hard-to-reach areas.

, Most people will dry their birds by the neck before plucking. Simply use a meat hook in the neck or beak to let the birds dangle for a few days in a cool, dry place, like your garage. This loosens the skin and feathers and prepares for later drawing and gutting.


Feathers come off best in heat. If you do hang the pheasants, let them return to room temperature before you start plucking."

Find a straight branch.,
At one end, take a knife and split down the middle about three inches.

,
Find a small twig and carefully shape it into a wedge.

,
Now, force the wedge into the split from step #2.,
Leaving the wedge in the stick, drill two small holes in the stick, one on each split end, down about one half inch from the top.

,
Thread heavy duty string through the two holes, and secure it so that it forms a ""bridge"" from one split to the other split.

Soak the birds quickly in hot water to make plucking much faster and easier.,
Set a large pot of water on the stove until it reaches roughly 140–150 °F (60–66 °C).,
Holding it by the neck, dunk the body of the pheasant into the scalding water for 30 seconds.,
Remove the bird, draining over the pot until water no longer streams down the sides.,
Dunk and drain the bird two more times so it ""cooks"" for 90 seconds total.,
Quickly pluck the pheasant as if you were doing a normal dry pluck.,
Heat and pluck only one pheasant at a time.",How to Pluck a Pheasant2," Dunking the birds into simmering water for 90 seconds will make the skin looser and the feathers more likely to slide out. It can weaken the skin a bit, and is likely overkill if you only have to clean 1-2 birds. However, if you have a large number of pheasants to pluck, this will save you tons of time.


Make sure the pot is big enough to fit a whole bird.
While this makes plucking faster, you only want to soak one pheasant at a time., The important thing is that the water is steaming, but not yet boiling. This is shortly after the water becomes too hot to touch. You want to scald the pheasants, not cook them.

, This will heat the skin and feathers, but won't allow any of it to actually start cooking.

, Remove the bird just long enough that it stops pouring water off it. This will temporarily cool it down.

, You want to work quickly, as it is the heat, not the water, that makes plucking easier., You should have your work station, with garbage bag and newspaper, already laid out. Let the last bits of water drain off, then get to work plucking while the pheasant is still hot. All of the normal rules apply:


Only remove 1-2 feathers at a time.
Hold the skin around the feathers tight with your supporting hand.
Use quick, forceful movements to yank out feathers., Remember that the heat, not the water, is what makes plucking easier. Don't try and dunk all of your pheasants at once, then pluck them all afterwards. Heat a pheasant, pluck it, then move on to the next one when it is done."

Cut a piece of wire for your snare.,
Create a small loop at the end of the wire.,
Twist the end of the wire to hold it in place.,
Take the opposite end of the wire and push it through your slip-knot loop.,
Pull the end of the wire through your slip-knot loop to make a noose.,
Drill a small hole through a stake or wooden post.,
Secure the wire to the stake.,
Drive the post into the ground.,
Angle the noose 6–8 inches (15.2–20.3 cm) above the ground.",How to Make a Rabbit Snare1," You want roughly 2.5 feet of wire to create your snare. While you can use any long, bendable string, usually a steel or aluminum wire works best.;
, Bend one end of the wire around your finger to create a small loop roughly 1 inch across. The end of the wire will bend back on itself so there are roughly 2–3 inches (5–8 cm) of extra wire at the bottom of the loop. This is your slip-knot loop.

, Wrap the excess wire from the loop around the wire at least 5-6 times to snugly secure them together. Imagine braiding two pieces of rope or hair snuggly together. This is the most important part of the trap, and the loop needs to be strongly attached. When done it will resemble a balloon on a string or the head of a needle.


Put a pencil into the loop and then try to pull it apart. It should hold firm under a fair amount of pressure.
You can use pliers to clamp the wires together for added stability., Feed the opposite end of your wire into the small loop you just made, like threading string through the top of a needle. Your wire will now resemble a large circle with the both ends of the wire close together.

, Keep pulling until the wire circle is roughly the size of your fist, around 6–7 inches (15–18 cm) across. Your wire will look like a yo-yo on the end of a string, with the wire on one end and your small noose on the other. The bottom wire should meet the noose at the slip-knot loop.

, This will keep your trap in place once a rabbit runs through it. The hole should be roughly 8–10 inches (20–25 cm) off of the ground once you secure the post in the ground.

, Feed 3-4 inches of wire through the hole in the post and then wrap it around so that it meets the rest of the wire. Braid the end of the wire to the rest of the wire, making a balloon shape like the one used to make the slip-knot loop.


You can also tie the wire to the post, or use a staple gun to secure it to the wood.
You want to have roughly a foot of wire between the post and your snare.
Tug on your wire to make sure it is attached to the post and does not come out easily.

, Find a small path where you’ve seen rabbits in the past and secure the post into the ground. Use a hammer to firmly stick the trap in place – it shouldn’t move or come out easily. You can also play your trap near fences or gardens, at the edge of high grass, or in the underbrush.


Make sure the post is driven into the ground firmly – if the rabbit can pull it out of the ground they will escape.

, Think of your noose as a target you want the rabbit to hit mid-jump. When the rabbit hops through the loop, it will pull the noose tightly shut, killing the rabbit.

Use your tools to break flakes off your platform.,
Prepare the surface between strikes.,
Select a flake.,
Select a suitable object.,

Select a small shaping tool.,
Sit and prepare to start working.,
Use the tool to shape an edge around the entire object.,
Flake more material off both sides of the edge to create the desired shape.,
Notch your arrowhead.",How to Make Arrowheads," It should be brittle, fine-grained (no large patterns or striations), uniform in texture, and contain no fractures. Jasper, chalcedony, quartzite, obsidian, and any type of chert or flint are all excellent choices.Obsidian is the most distinct, a very shiny black glass, but it only occurs in certain areas. Even if you can't identify any of these, however, there are still ways to test whether a rock is useful:
Tap the stone with another stone and listen to the ring. Generally speaking, the higher the pitch, the better the core.Strike it once with a harder stone. If a cone-shaped impression is left and sharp fragments break off, this rock is good for shaping.
Glass and porcelain will also work, but unless you have an unusually large piece, you'll probably skip straight to the instructions for shaping it into an arrowhead.
If you have no success finding the right rock in your area, you can use a beer bottle base and skip straight to instructions for shaping an arrowhead.;
, This will be your core, and the larger it is, the more chances you'll have at breaking off a good piece. However, it should be small enough to hold steadily between one hand and your leg.

, If you're using obsidian, glass, or another especially brittle material, you can select a softer rock. A specialized tool called a billet will also work.The stone should be roughly round, easy to grip, and harder than the material you selected. This is called a hammerstone.
A billet is a hard cylindrical object traditionally made from moose antler, bone, or very hard wood.
Soft hammerstones and billets are used on softer cores and for more precise flaking, since they ""catch"" on the core's material and allow you to direct the force more accurately.You only need one tool, but trying out several will let you test which one works best for the size and type of rock you chose.

, This is called a ""platform"", and should be located next to an edge of the rock with an acute angle (less than 90 degrees).









If your rock does not have a suitable platform, break apart one of the rounded edges with a large hard hammerstone.
A flatter platform will be easier to strike, but the angle of the edge is more important. A rough platform will improve as you hammer it.

, It may take practice before you can reliably form suitable flakes.









Sit with legs apart and hold the core firmly against your leg using your left hand (if you are right handed). Keep the platform oriented over the gap between your legs.
Strike the edge of the platform with a controlled glancing blow, coming from above and following through below the core.The ideal flake is long and fairly thin, though not so thin it will break. Large is good, so strike the platform with a good deal of force if you're only making small fragments.

, Set aside the flake just created and grind off small fragments from the striking surface's edge. This strengthens the platform and reduces the chance of unwanted breakage. You can use your hammerstone, any soft rock, or a nail file. 








This shouldn't require much force.
This is also referred to as ""brushing"" or ""abrading"" the rock.

, Once you've removed at least a few flakes, decide which one(s) to shape into an arrowhead. An ideal flake for this purpose is long, relatively thin, and convex on both sides.

, If you completed Part 1, you'll already have one made exactly for this purpose. Otherwise, a flat piece of glass such as the base of a beer bottle is an easily accessible material for practicing. Either way, the rest of the instructions refer to this as a flake.If using a beer bottle base, be sure to carefully remove hanging glass fragments with a rock before you begin. Gloves are especially important for this.

, If you created the flake yourself, this is the same process you used on the core to strengthen it between strikes. You can use a soft stone or nail file.









If there are any protrusions or areas too thin to use, break them off as you grind.
WARNING: Always prepare the edge below the centerline of the flake (an imaginary plane running through the horizontal center of the flake). Striking above the centerline will cause the flake to shatter.

, This is called a pressure flaker: a durable flexible tool, usually with an antler or copper tip. You can purchase one or make it yourself out of a copper nail fastened in a piece of hardwood., This should be in an outdoor area so you don't fill an enclosed space with rock dust. Gloves and goggles will prevent cuts.


Firmly hold the flake against your knee. The next step will require a fair amount of force, so you'll need to keep it stable.

, You'll be working on both sides of the flake to reduce the object to two convex sides with one edge between them. This is called creating a bifacial edge.








Push down with your pressure flaker below the centerline (midpoint of the object) to push off a smaller flake. This will create a ""flake scar"".
Flip the object over and use the flake scar to create a similar flake on the opposite side.
Rotate slightly and repeat. Eventually you'll have one edge all around the flake, with flake scars on either side.

, Pay attention to where you're applying force as you do this; you'll need to remove more material from portions of the object in order to end up with the ""rounded triangle"" or ""lens"" shape of an arrowhead.


REMEMBER, always keep the side you're working on face down. Pushing through the top of the object will shatter it.
Place your tool against the ""valley"" of a flake scar and push hard into the center of the object (not down as before).
Maintain that pressure inward and push down to remove a long flake extending as far toward the center of the object as you can manage.
Moving around the edge on both sides, repeat this process until the flakes you are removing reach the center of the object on both sides and the arrowhead shape is achieved. You may need to fully rotate the object several times.
Consider switching to smaller tools to make smaller adjustments as you near your goal., If you'd like to bind your arrowhead to an arrow shaft, you'll need to create two notches at the base. You can use a specialized notching tool similar to a flathead screwdriver, or use the same pressure flaking tool as before.









Using the same technique you used to begin your bifacial edge, flake off a portion of the base angled toward the center of the arrowhead.
Gradually work your way into the arrowhead until the notch is long and wide enough to tie onto an arrow shaft. Keep flipping the object over to work on each side of the notch in equal amounts.
Grind the inside edge of the notch smooth using a nail file.
Create a second notch on the opposite side of the base.

Then, cut one 12"" section of 1"" PVC and two 4"" sections of 1/2"" PVC fiberglass., Fist, insert one 4"" PVC pipe into the main bow pipe. Use a rubber mallet to hammer it in. It will be a tight squeeze, so you may need to use a lot of force. Force it all the way in until the tops of both pipes are flush at the end. After the first one is in, do the same with the second 4"" pipe on the opposite end., Cut the 1"" section of PVC pipe down the middle on one side. This will help you slide it over the main bow. Once you have it cut and placed in the center of the main bow, use the electrical tape to secure it on. Try overlapping the tape to create one sturdy layer.Face the side with the cut on the outside of the bow away from where the string will be. This is important because when you bend the bow during use, the cut may open and close. If the cut is facing the wrong side, it may pinch your fingers or rip the tape.

, You will need about 62"" of paracord to tie onto your bow. This length is a couple inches longer than you need, but you will lose some length as you tie the paracord onto the bow. Measure out 62"", and carefully cut the paracord straight across with sharp scissors.Seal off the ends with a flame. You can use a lighter or a match to lightly burn each end of the paracord. This will keep the ends from fraying.

, Use a hacksaw, or a saw of your choice, to create a 1/2"" wide groove that sits at a 70 degree angle. Angle the groove towards the back of the bow so it goes the same direction as the paracord as it is pulled. This angle helps the paracord stay secure, and a 1/2"" groove allows the paracord to fit snugly so it does not slip out., Start on one end, and when you have a firm knot secured, bring the string up to the other end and tie a second knot. There should be enough tension in the string so you can pull it with your finger, and it will snap back., To help finish the look of your bow, and protect the paracord on each end, consider placing on PVC caps. The 4"" inch caps should fit snugly onto each end. Do not glue the caps on because you want to easily remove them in case a string breaks, and you need to restring the bow., If you want to decorate your bow with some color, try using spray paint. Lay your bow down on a piece of cardboard outside, and spray directly onto the bow. Be sure to remove the paracord and PVC caps before painting, and allow the paint to fully dry before using your bow.Follow the directions on the label for the paint you decide to use.

Dye your burlap by filling buckets with fabric dye and hot water.,
Hang your burlap sacks to dry.,
Cut off the bottom and side stitching of the burlap sack.,
Using your fingers or a large-tooth comb, separate the individual strands of jute from the material.,
Cut your netting to the same size as the panels of fabric on your BDUs that are exposed when you're lying down.,
Attach your netting onto the back of your BDUs using a combination of the following; unwaxed dental floss (high tensile strength and because if no wax, it holds a knot a LOT better and does not rot like thread will over time) and ShoeGoo.,
Attach a piece of 2'x4'netting onto your boonie hat or ball cap style camo hat in the same fashion.,
Taking between 8 and 16 strands of jute of the same color at a time, tie them onto the netting using an over hand knot.,
Keep in mind, you want to create a ""mounding"" affect that breaks up the outline of the human shape.",How to Make a Military Style Ghillie Suit," Mix in the dye until the color of the water matches your desired result. Stuff the burlap sacks into the buckets and leave them to soak overnight.;
, Make no attempt to work with wet burlap (it's miserable).

, This will produce a rectangular piece of workable material. You can either discard the cut-off stitching or save them to tie onto your ghillie suit.

, Keep these strands organized by length and color.

, In my experience, the easiest way to do this is to put on your BDUs and lie on your belly while a friend or assistant drapes the netting over you, chalking over the netting where it meets the seams on your BDUs so you know where to cut it later.

, You can either attach the netting with just ShoeGoo, or you can use dental floss like you would use a needle and thread and then, ShoeGoo on top/over the knots you've made w/the dental floss. Anchor the netting onto the seams of your BDUs with unwaxed dental floss every 3 inches (7.6 cm) or so, adding additional stitches in areas of high stress such as the shoulders. (keep in mind, this takes a few hours to do it right. Ideally you don't want the netting to pull up any more than an inch to 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) off your back or you will deal with a 'sagging' effect.

, The netting should be large enough to completely cover your head and drape down below the neckline except for your face. If you want the netting to cover your face for some situations, you'll need to cut the face area in a manner that will allow you to tuck it up under your hat when you do not desire to conceal your face.

, You'll want to snug the knots well enough to stay, but not too tight, as you will ultimately need to add/remove burlap over time, to fit the colors of the area you're in. If the knots are too tight, removing colors that don't match your environment can be a real time consuming process. This step takes hours, but a good ghillie suit should.

, In doing so, you will need to use enough burlap, but, this makes for a very HOT and stuffy existence in the summer months, so take care in where you put the jute/burlap and how much you use. I know from experience that if you use too much, you will suffer because of it, both in weight of the ghille and the heat.

Cut a 2.5ft piece of wire, rope, or cord.,
Create a small loop at the end of the wire.,
Twist the end of the wire at the bottom of the loop to hold it in place.,
Take the opposite end of the wire and push it through your slip-knot loop.,
Keep pulling the end through your slip-knot loop to make a noose.,
Place a branch, felled tree, or bar horizontally over the ground.,
Tie your snare to the bar.,
Create barriers to force rabbits towards your trap.",How to Make a Rabbit Snare2," This is the wire that will capture and kill the rabbit in your snare, so it needs to be strong enough to hold the animal. While you can use any long and bendable wire, a thin metal wire works best.


While easier to work with, rabbits can chew threw many thin ropes and cords, making metal the best option.

, Bend one end of the wire back on itself to create a simple loop, no bigger than an inch. You can wrap the wire around your finger to get the shape and size right. There should be roughly 2–3 inches (5–8 cm) of extra wire at the bottom of the loop. This is your slip-knot loop.

, Wrap the excess wire from the loop around the wire at least 5-6 times to snugly secure them together. This is the most important part of the trap, and the loop needs to be strongly attached. When done, it will resemble a balloon on a string.


The best way to test the strength of your loop is to put a pencil into the loop and then pull it apart. If the loop comes undone then you should retwist the wire to create a stronger loop.
Use pliers to clamp the wires together for added stability if you need it., Feed the opposite end of your wire into the small loop you just made. Your whole wire will now resemble a large circle.

, Pull the end of the wire through the loop, shrinking your circle until it is the size of your fist, roughly 6-7 inches across. Your wire will look like a yo-yo on the end of a string.

, It should be elevated roughly a foot off the dirt and placed in a narrow corridor, such as a small footpath or a trampled trail in the forest. Your snare will hang from this to trap the rabbit.


Felled trees, low hanging branches, or iron bars will all work.
Make sure your bar is secured or heavy enough that a small rabbit couldn’t pull it away.

, The loop should be hanging from the trap so that it is 7-8 inches off of the ground. Your trap will resemble a noose hanging from a rafter or bar. As the rabbit jumps through the loop its weight will pull the loop tightly shut and kill the animal.

, Using large branches, block off the space underneath and to the sides of your snare, forcing them to jump through your loop. You want to block off all the space except the one in your snare.

"

Set up traps near fence holes.,
Place traps near small, beaten paths.,
Set multiple traps for the best results.,
Make sure your snares are the right height.,
Return to your traps after 24 hours.",How to Make a Rabbit Snare3," One of the best places to put a trap is in the holes rabbits use to enter your property. If your fence has openings that rabbits use regularly, fit the loop of your snare right in the hole and wait for them to come back.

, Rabbit trails will show grass that has been stepped down repeatedly, little tracks in the dirt, and patches of mud. If you could walk through it, then rabbits will likely use it at some point to navigate the forest.


Look for openings in tall grass, muddy paths, or known rabbit holes., Trapping is a numbers game; the more snares you set, the more rabbits you will get. Separate them by a few hundred yards to increase your chances of successful capturing.

, The snare works by catching the rabbit mid-hop so that it pulls the snare tight as it returns to the ground. You want your snare to be 6-8 inches off of the ground.


Remember that a rabbit needs to fit its head and ears into the trap. Most rabbits are 6-7 inches big from nose to ear tips., Constantly checking in on your trap scares away wildlife, so be patient. After one day has passed, return to the trap to check if it caught anything. If not, leave and return the next day. If you have still not caught anything, adjust the height of the snare or move it.

Gather the materials.,
Select the right tree.,
Cut down the tree.,
Peel off the bark.,
Inspect the wood.,
Cut the wood.,
Bend the limbs.,
Create the notches.,
String the bow.,
Try out your new bow.",How to Make a Hunting Bow2," You can use alternate tools in place of the suggested tools to create a wood bow, but just be sure you are using proper safety precautions. Here is a list of suggestion tools:


Hand axe
Machete
Draw knife
Wood rasp
Carpenters pencil
Tape measure
Straight edge
Bow string

, A hunting bow can be built from just about any tree, but there are certain qualities to look for. Find a tree that is about 4"" in diameter, smooth, and straight., Look for the straightest six foot section, and cut it down with a handsaw or chainsaw. Let the wood, or stave, mature for about six months in a dry place so the wood can dry out., The easiest way to remove bark is to use a draw knife. A draw knife is a woodworking hand tool that works nicely for skinning bark and roughing off corners. Use caution when working with a draw knife, and consider wearing gloves to protect your hands., Look for the cleanest and straightest side of wood that will fit the proper measurements for the bow which should be 68"" long. Try to find sturdy areas that do not show any signs of rot or weakness. Wood can be smoothed out, but there isn't anything you can do about wood that has started to break down. Once you find a good area, use a thick carpenter's pencil to mark where you will cut., Use a hatchet and machete to cut the ends. You want to make the limbs about 1/2"" thick near the ends, and leave the 4-6"" handle section in the middle about 2"" thick. To help shape the limbs to the appropriate thickness, use a wood rasp which has small teeth and is meant to shape and smooth out wood., After you have finished shaping the bow, place the bow limbs on the floor and give gentle pressure in the middle with your foot. You want to make sure the limb bends uniformly. Be careful when applying pressure, and go slow. You want to test the flexibility of the bow, but not break it.Check to see if the bow can bend into a semi circle. If the wood refuses to bend with ease, scrape away more wood to weaken the limb., At both ends of the bow limb, you need to cut notches that are about 1"" deep that will hold the string or paracord. Angle the notches towards you and away from the front of the bow. This will help secure the string at you are using the bow., Tie a knot around each end through the notches. Tie off one end, and then bring the string down to the other side. Make the string have enough tension so that it snaps when you pull it., You can either purchase arrows or make those yourself too. Be careful when using your new bow, and always practice caution.

Decide what game you're going to hunt.,
Pick a location.,
Hire a guide.,
Invite your friends.,
Pack the necessities.,
Be safe.,
Obey the law.",How to Organize a Hunting Trip," There are a lot of options, such as deer, elk, or bird, so consult with your group to see what they would prefer to hunt. Make sure that whatever you're hunting is in season and check to see what the limitations are. For example, sometimes you are only permitted to bag a certain number of animals in a single hunting trip.;
, Decide if you would rather be in a remote area and camp out in tents or on a deer blind, or if you would rather hunt in a more populated area and sleep in a lodge or hotel rooms.

, Even if you are an experienced hunter, a guide can make your hunting trip even more successful. Look in the yellow pages or on the Internet for a hunting guide. Talk to previous clients to see if the guide is worth hiring.

,


Give each person a job. One friend can be in charge of the food and another can take responsibility for the maps and planning the route.
Everyone should be in charge of their own individual equipment.

,


Take standard camping gear, like a tent, matches or a lighter, and sleeping bag.
Bring your favorite weapon. If you're unsure of what to bring, talk to a local hunting expert. Don't forget ammunition and a hunting knife.
Bring equipment to preserve your game. You wouldn't want all the game you collect on the trip to go bad before you can get it home. Get a large cooler and bring lots of ice.

, Go over safety requirements before anyone picks up a weapon.


Make sure all members of your hunting party know how to use their weapons and that they know how to set the safety on their weapons.
Make sure all of your hunting buddies are outfitted in orange hunting gear, so they are clearly visible to other hunters.
Tell someone your hunting plan. Leave your agenda and location details with someone who is not going on the hunting trip. This way, if anything goes wrong, the individual will know where to find you.
Keep all the weapons in one spot when they are not in use.
Be accountable to your other hunting buddies. Let each other know where you are going to be at all times--especially if you are out in a remote area of the woods.

,


Make sure the game you're hunting is in season.
Make sure your hunting license is valid. Do the same for all of your hunting buddies.
Be careful not to trespass on private property. You need permission to hunt and kill animals on private property.

Put your empty weapon in the holster.,
Put on the holster so your weapon is under your arm.,
Ensure that the point where the straps cross in back is centered high on your back, just below the back of your shirt collar.,
Adjust the holster the straps.,
Check to see if your magazine carrier is under your right arm (left arm for left-handed shooters) and that you can easily unsnap it and remove the magazines.,
Attach the tie-downs to your belt, if you usually wear a belt.,
Put on a jacket and practice drawing your weapon and removing your magazines.,
Consider cutting the strap ends after the final adjustment if they are long enough to get in the way when you're drawing your weapon.

",How to Wear a Shoulder Holster," Put the magazines in the magazine carrier, if you have one. If your shoulder holster is designed to carry 2 firearms, put both in the holster.;
, It should be under your left arm if you are a right-handed shooter, your right arm for left-handed shooters, or both arms for double carry.

, Make sure the straps aren't twisted.


If your shoulder holster has shoulder pads connected with a strap in back, adjust it so the pads are placed high on your shoulder, near your neck, and not over the shoulder joint. Make sure they're even and centered back-to-front.

,


The holster should hold the weapon horizontally with the muzzle pointed behind you. The handgrip should protrude 2 inches (5 cm) in front on your left arm when it's relaxed at your side. This forward position makes it easier to draw you firearm, and prevents the muzzle from printing (showing an outline) on the back on your jacket.
If you're carrying your firearm vertically, the handgrip should still be forward of your arm. Weapons with long barrels should be carried vertically so the muzzle points at the ground.

, If you can't, readjust the straps until you can.


You may find you can reach the magazine carrier more easily if you adjust it so it's forward of your arm and tipped up slightly.

, Adjust the straps to keep your weapon and magazines snug against your sides without pulling on your shoulders. Tie-downs are optional.

, Make sure you can do this smoothly and quickly. If you can't, make further adjustments.

Learn and follow all the rules of the specific shooting range.,
Double-check that you have everything mandatory before entering the range.,
Have your gun thoroughly unloaded, with its bolt or action open, and in its case before you bring it into the building.,
Stay away from the shooting tables and your guns when anyone is downrange.,
Never walk in front of a loaded gun, even if the gun's safety is on.,
If there's a range master around, familiarize yourself with him and do as he says.,
Wear eye and ear protection.,
Learn the rules on collecting empty shells at the shooting range.,
Get yourself and your things set up.,
Always make sure the range is clear of people before commencing shooting.,
Make sure everyone knows the rules and safety practices of the range, and that everyone knows when the range is hot (people are shooting) and when all guns must be set down and not touched so people can go downrange.,
When the range is hot, go to your shooting bay, load your cartridge or gun, and shoot at your target.Between loading your gun and firing it, turn on the safety.,
When you're done shooting for the time, make sure all your gun's rounds are emptied, the gun is completely unloaded, and its action is left open so others can see that it's empty.,
When all the shooters are done shooting for the time, make sure it's good with everyone and then declare the range as cold.,
Don't be rude or obnoxious.,
Know that you may not be allowed to enter as a spectator or guest, and even then you may have to pay to enter the shooting range.,
Wear eye and ear protection.,
Stay behind the shooting tables and sit quietly.,
Don't take any water or food with you into the range.,
If you need to ask someone something about the range or shooting, realize that you may have to do so rather loudly due to the ear protectors.

,
Don't take any pictures of those shooting.",How to Use a Shooting Range," You can usually pick up a pamphlet of rules for free, and sometimes rules are also posted outside the shooting range buildings. Make sure you know and are following all the rules before entering the shooting range.


The only common requirement of every shooting range in the US is that the shooter must be at least 18 or 21 years of age (or have a legal guardian present) and have signed a waiver beforehand.Know that a ""hot"" range is when the range is active and people are shooting downrange. A ""cold"", or inactive, range is when absolutely no one is allowed to shoot, all guns must be completely unloaded, and no one is permitted to even touch their guns.;
, This usually includes but is not limited to the following.


Eye protection
Ear protection
Gun case
Targets (sometimes you can purchase these at shooting ranges, other times you'll need to bring your own and some way to set them up)

, Check to make sure its unloaded once, twice, and three times. Being thoroughly unloaded means there should be absolutely zero ammunition in the gun or the gun's cartridge.

, This is mandatory at some shooting ranges, at others it isn't mandatory but is a very good safety practice.

, Anyone can make a mistake and a gun's safety mechanism can be faulty. Never trust that a loaded gun won't go off, and place yourself accordingly.

, If you, or someone else, is doing something that could be unsafe, he should tell you to stop. If he does, listen to him.

, This is almost always mandatory, and even if not, it's best to protect your senses. Sometimes prescription glasses or sunglasses are allowed as eye protection, though at some ranges you'll need actual safety glasses. For ear protection, both foam/plastic inserts and shooting ear muffs should be okay.

, These rules differ from range to range: Some ranges will penalize you for collecting empty ammunition shells or cases, while others' rules state you must clean up after yourself. Sometimes the latter type of ranges will have a container you can 'donate' your emptied shells into, other times you'll have to take them home to dispose of them.

, Set your gun at an empty bay or empty table, and set your stuff along the wall behind you. People at shooting ranges are almost astoundingly polite and friendly; you'll probably never need to worry about someone messing with your stuff.

, Generally shooting ranges are set up with two repeated types of usage: one when the range is hot and people are shooting at the targets; the second when every person is done shooting, all the guns are unloaded and not being touched, and people are permitted downrange to check, set up, or tear down targets.

,


If a shooter or spectator doesn't know the rules or isn't practicing proper gun safety and could harm others, kindly tell them so. Explain the rules and why they're in place, and any other gun safety if applicable.

, This isn't always required but is a good precaution. Just remember that safety's don't always work and you should never treat a loaded, ""safe"" gun as if it's actually safe. It isn't.
Practice muzzle control at all times. Never point your gun's barrel near any people, wildlife, or anything like metal or rock where a bullet could ricochet.
Keep your finger off the trigger. This is a very good habit to form, and you should never touch the trigger at all until you're aimed and ready to shoot.
Don't shoot at other people's targets unless they left it up. Sometimes people will leave their targets hanging for others to use, but that's sometimes considered rude.
Don't shoot the wildlife. Some wildlife such as deer will venture close to shooting ranges. These are not intended for targets and should not be shot at unless you want to face high fees or penalties.

, Step back from your gun and have a seat along the bench wall, letting other shooters know that you're done shooting for now and are waiting for them to finish before going downrange.

, When the range is cold, people can go downrange to check, set up, or tear down targets.


Some nicer gun ranges will have a flag or light system set up to indicate when the range is cold.

, Communicate with the other shooters and try to do everything in a timely manner. (Do note that some shooting ranges have designated times for the range being hot and the range being totally cold and inactive; if so, follow these designated times along with everyone else.)


If all the other shooters have their guns emptied and unloaded and are waiting to go downrange, don't spend forever shooting more rounds. Instead, finish off the rounds you have loaded, triple-check that your gun is empty and the action is open, and let the other shooters know that you are done shooting.
If you aren't done shooting and the other shooters are asking how many more rounds until you're done, indicate the answer by holding up your fingers. This is often easier and more efficient than trying to shout above the ear protectors.
When you do go downrange to examine, set up, or tear down targets, try to do this quickly. Don't have everyone waiting on you.

, Sometimes shooting ranges will allow a member to invite a guest, but only for a limited number of times. Know the rules for your shooting range before driving out there.

, Even if you aren't shooting and even if this isn't required, it's still best to protect your senses. Sometimes prescription glasses or sunglasses are allowed as eye protection, though at some ranges you'll need actual safety glasses. Both foam/plastic inserts and shooting ear muffs should be okay.

, Don't touch or mess with anything that you didn't bring with you.

, This is due to the possibility of the ammunition containing lead (some still does), and is a rule at some shooting ranges.

,, Guns are a very controversial topic in some areas and there's no need to start strife in a community. This is common courtesy.

Check your local laws.,
Choose a suitable location.,
Build a shelter.,
Get a sleeping bag.",How to Live Outside1," While you may plan to live in a public park or state forest, understand that it may be illegal to live in these areas. Make sure that there are no rules about sleeping in public or forbidding ""vagrancy.""In state and national parks, check to see if you need a camping license.


You can research laws on a city or state website or by visiting a county law library. State and national park guidelines are usually listed on their website.
Never trespass on somebody else's land. You could be fined or arrested.;
, Location is everything. You should find a safe area where you can set up your shelter without being disturbed. If you are in a city or urban area, you might be limited in where you can set up, but in the wilderness, you just have to find a secure location.


If you are living in the wilderness, you should find a place that is far away from any potential hazards (such as cliffs, rockfalls, avalanches, or flooding). Find a location that is close to fresh water and to places where you can forage for materials.In a town, you may be able to set up a shelter under a bridge, at the beach or park, or just outside city limits., While you can always sleep under the stars, you should have some sort of shelter to protect yourself from wild animals, bad weather, or wind. You can easily make your own shelter out of local materials or from a tarp.A tent is the easiest and most convenient form of shelter. If you don’t have a tent, you can hang a tarp between two trees for a similar effect.
If you are living in a hot, dry climate, you might build a ramada. This is a roof suspended on poles without walls.
If you are living in snowy conditions, try a snow cave or an igloo. A quinzhee is also an option. This is a dome made out of snow with a hollow inside.
Use whatever materials you have on hand for the shelter. If you don't have a tarp, for example, you can use garbage bags or an old raincoat.

, A good sleeping bag will insulate you during cold or nasty weather, and it provides a certain degree of comfort as well. Try to invest in a good sleeping bag that you can carry with you wherever you go.


If you need to make your own bed, insulate the ground with a tarp, leaves, ferns, blankets, or other materials to help keep heat in your shelter and your bed.Cover yourself with a tarp or blanket if possible.

Identify sources of food.,
Carry fresh water at all times.,
Locate places where you can bathe.,
Make use of public facilities.",How to Live Outside2," You can always buy food to eat, but if you are trying to save money, make sure that you can find free sources of food. You can forage for food in both urban and wild environments.Research your local region to find out what types of edible greens, nuts, flowers, berries, mushrooms, and fruits grow there. Dandelions, watercress, cattails, strawberries, blackberries, morel mushrooms, and acorns are common wild foods in the US.
If you are in a town, you might ask a grocery store or restaurant about taking foods that they would otherwise throw out. Usually these foods are too old to sell, but they are still good to eat.
You can always visit a food bank, soup kitchen, or a welfare agency for assistance.

, Carry a bottle or two of fresh water everywhere. You can get water from rivers, lakes, or streams. You can also collect rainwater in jugs or buckets. If you are near populated areas, you can get water from a water fountain, public restroom, or restaurant.Reuse plastic water or soda bottles. These are a much cheaper option than buying a fancy bottle.
Make sure to purify any water if it came from a natural source. The easiest way to do this is to boil the water first. You can also use a water pump or treat it with iodine.

, Good hygiene is important, even if you are living outside. A bath or shower can help keep you clean and healthy. It will also reduce the risk of infection.You can buy a one-day gym pass to use the bathrooms at a gym. You might also be able to pay for a shower at a truck stop.
Homeless shelters and public pools often have showers that you can use for free.
Natural sources of water, such as rivers, streams, and lakes, can be used for baths. Just make sure that you are not in a populated area where nudity is not allowed.
If you want to clean your clothes, go to the closest laundromat. You can also wash them in a clean lake or stream.

, If you are living outdoors, you may still want access to technology, electricity, and other aspects of modern life. You can always rely on public spaces to get these without having to live indoors.


If you need to charge your phone, you may be able to find a café, library, or bus stop that will let you use their outlets.
If you want to use a computer, go to a public library. If you own a laptop, cafes, bookstores, malls, and libraries often have free public wifi.
Homeless shelters can give you a roof over your head during storms or if you just need a break from the outdoors.

Learn survival skills.,
Bring a first aid kit.,
Dress appropriately.,
Protect yourself from weather.,
Create an emergency plan.",How to Live Outside3," If you want to live in the wilderness, you need to learn specialized skills to help you survive. You can take a class on wilderness survival or read wilderness survival manuals, outdoor magazines, and nature blogs. Go the library to use their computers or books for free. Research the dangers of your region as well. Important skills to learn include:Building a fire
Cooking food
Healing minor injuries
Foraging for safe foods
Fishing

, No matter where you are going or how experienced you are, you should carry basic medical supplies at all times. Keep your supplies in a waterproof container. A good first aid kit should include:Gauze and waterproof dressings
Adhesive bandages
Tweezers
Antibiotic cream
Ibuprofen or acetaminophen
Any required prescription medications

, What you wear is one of the most vital aspects of survival. Make sure that your clothes are right for your local climate. As a general rule, always wear one more layer than you need.Choose fabrics that will dry quickly and which will provide warmth even if wet. Go with wool if you can. Avoid cotton.
Keep a waterproof shell, jacket, poncho, or raincoat in case of rain or snow.
Wear sturdy shoes. Make sure to have warm socks on underneath.
If you live in a place with cold winters, you will need insulated and layered clothing. Cover every part of your body, including your hands, head, face, and neck.Visit thrift stores, clothing donation sites, and charities for cheap or free clothing for all seasons. You can even find winter coats at low cost.

, If there is a storm, snowstorm, tornado, or other dangerous weather, you will need to make sure you can survive it. This means that you may need to find alternate shelter during these events.If you are living near an urban environment, you might go a public building to wait out the storm.
Find a ditch or a low-lying crevice if there is a tornado.
Rockwall and boulders can provide shelter from the wind.
Avoid tall structures during lightning storms. In the woods, go to a low-lying area or find shelter under smaller trees away from the larger trees. In an open field, go to the lowest area possible, and crouch down., It is important that you can get medical attention or rescue if you need it. Determine now how you will contact the authorities should you become injured, lost, ill, or stuck.


Always let someone know where you are living. Ask them to check up on you periodically.
You should always have a way to contact help, even if you live in remote wilderness. This could be a satellite phone, a cell phone, a two-way radio, or flares.

Lay out your tent cloth.,
Tie the corners at each end together.

,Now you have a hammock with no tarp, good, just center the tarp on one of the 20 foot (6.1 m) straps and attach it with resin in everywhere but the middle (unless you think you want to finish now, then you just put everywhere the strap makes contact)

,
AND THAT IS THE STEPS FOR A BASIC HAMMOCK, supplies to make it better are: 1 tight mesh fabric (big enough to cover the opening), thick vinyl (same size) and and about 16 square inches extra, the other strap, a blanket, a pillow, and sewing supplies START ON STEP 12 AND THEN GO BACK TO 5.

,Sew the mesh onto all edges of the opening, i know it looks like you can't get in but we will fix that

,Cut down the middle OF THE MESH and sew a zipper in there

,
Sew the vinyl along ONE SIDE of the mesh, and a long zipper along the other, it should look like the diagram on this line (/z) ()=sides of hammock /=sewing z=zipper


Now you have a semi-waterproof hammock, and your tarp completes that, but, how will you breathe

,Cut air holes in the SIDE, NOT THE BOTTOM, and sew mesh to cover those

Purchase a brand new toilet plunger brush.
,

Cut a hole in the lid that is big enough to insert the plunger handle through.,

Decorate if wished.,

Fill the camp washing machine with water, clothes, and suitable detergent (see ""Tips"").,

Start plunging.,

Remove the lid and check the clothing.,

Hang to dry.",How to Make a Camp Washing Machine," A size near enough is fine too, provided that it has a lid. If you have a restaurant industry wholesaler near you, food buckets with lids work just as well.
,, The plunger will always need to be inserted from the underside of the lid through to your hand when using., It can be helpful to label the bucket ""CAMP WASHING MACHINE"" in waterproof marker so that everyone knows what it is and doesn't try to use it for other purposes like filling up with fish bait..., Insert the plunger into the lid and place the lid onto the bucket, holding onto the plunger handle., Unfortunately, you're the source of energy for this washing machine but it will work well. Plunge up and down to mimic the action of a washing machine agitator. Do this for about five minutes. Take turns if it gets overwhelmingly tiring or boring., If the clothing looks clean, you can either perform a rinse cycle, or just hang to dry. The ability to rinse or not will be dependent on water availability, your patience level, and the pressing need for the clothing to be rinsed while camping!, There are lots of choices for hanging clothes when camping, just avoid barbed wire fences and thorns. Some ideas include:

Hang from tent spaces
Hang in the car if car camping
Hang over a fence
Hang from clean tree branches and bushes (check for dirt, sap, insects, etc. first)
From a piece of string or rope tied between trees or objects
From a camp clothes line if you have one
Over camp furniture
On your body if swimwear

Clean the knife thoroughly.,
Select a sharpening tool.,
Lubricate your stone if desired.,
Lay the blade across the stone.,
Sharpen one side of the blade.,
Sharpen the other side.,
Switch to a finer stone.,
Dry the blade.,
Strop the blade.,
Check the sharpness.",How to Sharpen a Swiss Army Knife," Dirt or grease on the blade may result in an uneven sharpening of your knife.


Sharpening the blade may be easier if you briefly dip the cold blade into boiling water right before you begin sharpening it.;
, There are numerous types of files and sharpeners on the market, including Japanese water stones, stones with diamond encrusted surfaces, and stones with different grades of grit.


These different tools will give you slightly different results. For most purposes, a basic, two-sided sharpening stone, available for about $10 at most hardware stores, will be adequate.There is also a knife sharpener you can buy specifically for the purpose of sharpening Swiss Army Knives, available from the company's online store.

, There is some disagreement as to whether it is important or even beneficial to lubricate your sharpening stone.If you choose to lubricate yours, a variety of different options are available.


Some people believe that lubricant should be used because the friction that results from sharpening the blade has the potential to warp it,or because the lubricant will help float away metal particles that can dull the blade during the sharpening process or clog the pores of the stone itself.Others believe lubricant is unnecessary, slows the process the down, and may actually dull the blade by washing the metal particles over the blade during the sharpening process.If you opt to use a lubricant, you can use cutting oil, mineral oil, kerosene, or WD-40 on natural stones, or water on diamond stones.Before applying oil, consult any instructions that came with your sharpening stone. Some types of stones can be ruined by the use of oil., The blade should meet the stone at an angle of 15°-20.° This will result in a cutting angle of 30°-40.°Keeping the angle consistent throughout the sharpening process is key to a good sharpening. With an official Swiss Army knife, you can approximate the correct angle by resting the back edge of the blade on two stacked pennies.If you have a hard time keeping the angle correct and consistent, you can buy a sharpening guide for about $10 that will make the task easier., Run the knife along the stone as if you were trying to carve a thin piece off the stones surface, repeating this motion several times.If your knife is very dull, start this process on the rough side of the whetting stone, or with a diamond stone.Don't apply too much pressure. Let the stone do the work.If using lubricant, add more every few dozen strokes to wash away metal shavings.If the knife blade is longer than the stone, you’ll need to sweep the blade sideways as you sharpen so that the entire edge is sharpened completely and evenly.As a rule of thumb, you'll want to give the blade six to twelve strokes across the stone.A more precise way to know when to switch sides is to look for a burr (also sometimes called a ""wire"") that is formed on the other side of the edge. You'll be able to feel burr with your thumb on the side of the edge opposite the stone. The formation of a burr indicates that the steel is thin enough at the very edge that it is folding over slightly.The steel must get very thin to be razor-sharp.

, Now, turn the blade over and repeat the process, sharpening the other side of the blade., To get a razor-sharp edge, and to remove the burr on the knife, you'll now want to switch to finer grit (i.e. the other side of your whetting stone, if you've got a standard two-sided sharpener).At this stage, alternate which side of the blade is making contact with the stone with each stroke.Apply even gentler pressure on these last few strokes to avoid raising another burr., Wipe the blade on a towel or clean rag to remove any lubricant and metal fragments from the sharpening process., Stropping is running the blade edge across a leather strap that has been covered with an abrasive such as stropping paste or green chromium oxide.It puts a final polish on your knife edge.


Move the blade in the opposite direction you did when sharpening. Run it over the leather with the ""spine"" of the blade at the front and the sharp edge behind.Stropping the blade between sharpenings can help keep your blade sharp longer., Once you think you're done sharpening the knife, check to see if the blade is sharp. There are several ways to do this.


Cut some paper. A razor-sharp blade will easily cut right through.Shine a bright light on the sharpened edge. A dull edge will reflect the light.Drag the edge lightly across your thumbnail. The blade should scrape the nail cleanly, without catching or vibrating."

Train within your limits.,
Run and walk in intervals.,
Stick to an easy pace.,
Increase your mileage.,
Establish “normal” runs versus longer runs.,
Select a “medium” run.,
Keep your easy and medium runs fixed.",How to Run Longer Without Getting Tired1," Whether you are only beginning to run or have already made a practice of it, design a training schedule based on your current abilities. Forget “no pain, no gain.” Resist the urge to push yourself too hard too fast. Keep your runs sensible and achievable, especially in the beginning.Running is a high-impact exercise with a risk of injury, especially for beginners. The tortoise-wins-the-race mindset will decrease your chance of injuring yourself while gradually increasing your endurance.;
, If you have little or no miles under your belt, alternate between running and walking in the beginning. Jog for one minute, then walk for four. Repeat three more times for a total workout of 20 minutes. As the one-minute jogging intervals become easier from one workout to the next, double them to two minutes each and decrease the walking intervals to three. Continue to increase the jogging and decrease the walking over time until you are comfortably running for a total 20-minute stretch.

, Keep it slow enough for you to be able to jog and talk with someone else at the same time without becoming seriously winded. Worry about developing speed later. For now, allow your body to adjust to the rigors of running without taxing it too much. Concentrate more on perfecting your form so it becomes more natural and less of a “pose” that you have to actively think about maintaining., Whether you plan your runs according to distances or set amounts of time, increase the amount you run in one session bit by bit. Be sure to make the changes gradually.

For instance, once you are able to run 20 minutes at a consistent, easy pace, add another five minutes to your runs. Then, once 25 minutes becomes perfectly manageable, add another five to make it a half-hour run., Once you are consistently able to jog comfortably for a certain length of time or distance (let’s say for 30 minutes straight), designate this length as your normal or “easy” run. In a given week, alternate between easy runs and longer ones.Again, increase your mileage gradually. On your first longer run, jog at your normal pace for 40 minutes, or even just 35. As this extra mileage becomes manageable, increase it by another five or ten minutes.


However many days per week you are able to commit to running, always be sure to go out on more easy runs than longer ones each week., As you grow more accustomed to jogging for longer stretches than your easy run, pick a certain distance or amount of time as your medium run.Include at least one medium run in your weekly training, as well as one longer run. On your medium run, stick to the designated distance or time, while continuing to add mileage incrementally to your “long” run.


Let’s say you run five days a week. Your easy run is 30 minutes and your medium run is 40 minutes. On Day 1, jog for 30. On Day 2, jog for 40. On Day 3, jog for 30. Then, on Day 4, jog for 45 or 50 minutes. After that, finish your week with another easy 30-minute run.

, In general, the more mileage you run, the more damage your body incurs due to the constant impact with the ground.Once you establish your easy and medium runs, stick to those limits, whether you define them by distance or time. Focus on improving your performance within those limits rather than continue to endlessly expand them over time.


Continue to add mileage a little at a time to your long runs if desired, but never do more than one long run per week. Give your body the chance to recuperate."

Shorten your runs.,
Run fartleks.When you go out for a run, set the timer on your watch for a short amount of time.,
Charge hills.,
Work out on the track.",How to Run Longer Without Getting Tired2," Once you are satisfied with your ability to run long distances at a comfortable pace without getting tired, focus on increasing your speed. Start with your easy runs. Run a shorter distance at a slightly faster speed than normal.For example, if your easy run is 30 minutes, run for 20 minutes at a quicker pace. If you have built up enough endurance, you should still be able to have a slightly breathy conversation while doing so.


As you adjust to jogging faster on your easy runs, increase your easy runs back to their original length. Move on to running shorter medium runs at a quicker pace. Once you have mastered that, slowly increase your medium runs until they reach their original length.
Once your faster pace becomes your new “normal” pace, repeat the process to add more speed with an even quicker pace.

, Let’s say five minutes. Be sure to set the timer on repeat so it continues to count down five minutes again and again. Start off at your normal pace for the first five minutes. When the timer goes off, increase your speed to a pace that you can run consistently for the next five minutes. When the timer goes off again, drop back to your normal pace. Repeat for the duration of your run.


Over time, as five-minute intervals become less challenging, increase each interval by another five minutes.

, Find a low, steep hill. Or, if you live in a particularly mountainous area where there is no such thing as a “low” hill, mark a distance up the gradient to sprint for eight to twelve seconds. Sprint up the hill as fast as you can, walk or jog back down, and repeat. Exercise as many leg muscles as possible, all at once.Gradually increase the number of reps from workout to workout as each one becomes easier.

, Sprint at full-speed on a 100-meter straightaway.As always, start small. Do only a few reps at first, with a focus on form. As you become able to maintain maximum speed from start to finish in every rep, increase the number of reps.


Also gradually increase the distance. Do 200-meter sprints, then 300, then 400. Each time you increase the distance, decrease your speed so you can grow accustomed to the longer distance, then gradually increase your pace, with the aim of sprinting at a consistent pace from beginning to end.
Try combining various distances into your reps. For example, sprint for 400 meters, then jog for 100. After that 100-meter jog, sprint for 300, then jog for another 100. Sprint for 200 after that, then jog one 400-meter lap around the track to recuperate before repeating the rep.

Keep your strides short.,
Maintain posture.,
Keep everything moving forward.",How to Run Longer Without Getting Tired3," Avoid overextending your leg in front or in back of you. When you raise your knee ahead of you, keep that foot’s heel directly below it as you bring it down, so that your shin is perpendicular with the ground at a 90º angle when your foot lands. When you want to burst forward with a faster speed, focus on increasing the number of strides you take while maintaining this form, rather than reaching farther forward with your leading foot.The only time you should change the length of your stride is on hills. Shorten your stride to climb hills faster with more steps, and then open your legs up into a wider stride as you descend., Keep your back straight to open your chest and fill your lungs with air. Imagine drawing each breath all the way down to your stomach in a straight line from your nose and mouth to your belly.Lean forward a tiny bit to push your body forward if needed (for example, when you run into the wind),but avoid slouching so far forward that your lungs become constricted.

, Keep your eyes up so that you are looking directly ahead. Pump your arms front to back to drive your legs. Avoid crossing them over your chest in a side-to-side motion as you run, or bunching them up tight over your armpits.With each stride, your knuckles or hands should brush your hips on their way forward or back.Running with your thumbs up is a simple way to remind your arms to move forward and backward instead of side-to-side. Don’t hold them too rigidly, however,since this will tense up your arms, needlessly burning energy.

Read the Air Chair manual to learn the correct setup and all of the possible options.,
Setup the ""blades"".,
Insert the wedge.,
Tighten all bolts on the base and blades, and insert the post into the bottom of the chair and be sure the bolt is hand-tightened (not too tight) and the pin is placed through the shaft of the chair for extra safety.

",How to Ride an Air Chair1,";
, There are two blades which make up the hydrofoil. The front blade is stationary and creates the majority of the lift. For the second blade, there is more than one option.


The Air Chair is shipped with a ""beginners"" blade which is very stable and makes learning easier. The blade is somewhat triangle-shaped with two fins on the bottom.
A secondary rear blade is much more rounded (like a thick boomerang). This blade makes the chair more maneuverable, but also requires more practice to control well. When the ends of the ""boomerang"" are pointed toward the rear it is the intermediate setting, and when the blade is flipped around, it creates the advanced configuration.

, Not only are the blades affecting how the chair rides, but there are wedges which fit between the base and the blades that affect how much lift is created and the general angle-of-attack that the hydrofoil uses.


There are different sizes of wedges and the placement of the wedge will finely tune the angle.
It is usually best to start with the medium size wedge, and experiment with the placement, and move to the other wedges if you need the chair to handle differently.

Do not pack any canned foods.,
Share the load.,

Fuel.,
Pack the right clothes.,

Dual purpose.,
Upgrade.",How to Lighten Your Pack for a Backpacking Trek," Plan your menu without cans, the metal is heavy, they are full of water and you have to hike them out. It is easier than ever now that tuna (a backpacking favorite) is packaged in vacuum sealed bags instead of cans. Between mountain house and other dehydrated foods, and grocery/ health foods stores selling bulk dry grains and fruit, there is no reason to carry cans.;
, Divide a 2-3 person tent into poles, tent, and fly (or whatever is even). Split up the stove, fuel and cookware. Only pack one water filter per 3-4 people. Does everybody need their own GPS, big survival knife or Leatherman tool? How about just one per group.

, This won't make your pack any lighter, but it can shift 15-30 lbs. from your legs/feet to your arms.

, If you're planning for summer, or a hot climate consider purchasing a +40f rated bag, or just a light fleece blanket and leave the -15f down at home. For spring/fall when the temperature can drop from a seemingly sunny day, bring a wool hat, it is lighter and warmer than another layer. Buy a comfortable and breathable rain jacket you can wear as an extra layer.

, Titanium cookware despite its durability and super-coolness, can be the same or heaver than its aluminum or lexan counterparts. Nalgene and Kleen canteen brand bottles come in fashionable colors but are significantly heavier (and not necessarily more durable) than disposable plastic water bottles. Even the lightest Thermarest inflatable pad is heavier than the heaviest z-rest or ridgerest foam pad.

, Shoes are a balancing act, too light and you risk injury, too heavy and they can feel unnatural and tire you out. If you are carrying a heavy load and need full ankle boots, consider synthetic materials rather than full leather, and never ever use steel toed or steel shank boots. If your pack is under 1/4 of your body weight, or you feel comfortable and experienced enough, low top boots or trail running shoes are a great alternative. They are as tough as full boots but much lighter (while sacrificing some ankle support). They say an ounce on the feet is a pound on the back.

, While many of us would love to carry nothing but a flint to cook with, few national forest or parks allow wood gathering, and those that do have restrictions (high altitude, burn bans) which can prevent use of firewood as a dependable fuel source. So use your fuel wisely. I love to cook with grains, beans when i backpack, but dry lentils and plain rice can take 20-30 minutes worth of gas. Instead use dehydrated beans and instant rice, which take a little over 5 minutes. Also, iodine tablets or a UV sterilizer is lighter than the fuel it takes to boil as much water. Don't forget your wind-shield.

, Extra socks are a no brainer, but any clothes not planned for layering are not needed. If you're wet and risking hypothermia, time to get in the sleeping bag. A dry sweater can only do so much. Wash your clothes in a stream (not as good as a machine with stain fighter and downy, but it still feels really good).

, Synthetic (Coolmax, Duofold, under armor) in the summer. Wool and silk in the winter.

, Rain gear as an extra layer. Eat and cook with the same utensil. Use a space blanket as a ground cloth. Trekking poles as rain fly poles. Pot as washbasin. Pill divider as spice rack. the list goes on and on.

, So, you've weeded out every extraneous milligram from your pack, and you still want to go lighter? Time to bust out the wallet. A big weight factor is the pack itself. Gregory, Patagonia, and Dana Designs all make ""ultralight"" backpacks. These are different from typical frame backpacks in that they use silicon impregnated nylon (same stuff as hot air balloons and stunt parachutes) instead of heavy-duty nylon and have a carbon fiber, aircraft aluminum, or no frame at all. Some tent companies offer aircraft or carbon fiber pole upgrades from their heavier fiberglass or aluminum stock poles.

Look for a caliber stamped or marked on the frame or barrel of your pistol (such as 9mm, .45 ACP or .38 SPCL).,
Consider the type of ammo that you prefer.,
For target practice, almost any bullet will work.,
For hunting, accuracy, penetration, and expansion are the most important things.,
For self-defense, dependable function is second only to bullet placement.,
Cost is also something to consider.,
Look at the bullet weight.,
Realize that some calibers can utilize different bullets.,
Consider the source of your ammunition.",How to Pick Pistol Ammo1," The caliber of ammo on the box you use should match the markings on your pistol. Understand that caliber alone is not the soul requisite for choosing the correct ammo, there are several 45 caliber bullets, and more than one 9 mm, and these are not interchangeable.;
, The type of bullet (or projectile that will be striking your target) varies and may be important if you are using the ammo for a specific activity such as either target shooting, hunting, or self-defense. Here are examples:


Full Metal Jacket (FMJ) have a brass or other metal casing surrounding the softer (usually lead) core. These are required by the Geneva Convention for military rounds, as they have very limited expansion, making combat wounds less devastating. They generally leave less fouling on the barrel's rifling, resulting in slightly better accuracy than some other rounds.
Soft point bullets have the front, or tip of the bullets soft metal core exposed, but the sides and tail of the bullet are jacketed so they foul the barrel less than bullets with no jacket at all, and engage the barrel's rifling more aggressively.
Hollow points have a hole in the center of the tip of the bullet, which causes more initial expansion on impact. There are arguments as to whether this feature affects accuracy, but the real results vary from gun to gun.
Semi Wadcutter bullets are flattened on the end to create a shockwave in living tissue on impact. These are often a preferred round for self defense, since the generally do more damage than other bullets.
Wadcutters have a completely flattened tip, again designed for causing maximum damage on impact.
Shot shell bullets are bullets load with small bird shot, sometimes referred to as rat shot, used for shooting small varmints (hence the name) at very close ranges.
Non Lethal rounds are special low velocity rounds used for riot control and other police/military purposes.
Blanks, as the name implies, are blank cartridges, containing only a powder charge, used for theatrical purposes or in starter pistols.
Other bullets include frangible bullets, tracers, and armor piercing rounds with special purposes not really addressed in this content.

, All you are doing is putting holes in paper. However, trying different types of bullets while target-shooting will give you an idea of how that bullet functions in your gun. How accurate the ammo is, and how dirty your gun becomes when using that ammo will be apparent as well. You can observe how much ""flash"", noise and recoil are produced.

, You may only get one shot at a living target; if you miss and scare it away. The bullet design is also important depending on what you are hunting, and more can be read about that elsewhere.

, You do not want to use a bullet type or under-powered ammo that will not function in your weapon.

, Use less expensive ammo for high-volume plinking. This will give you both familiarity and skill with your weapon. If you decide to use expensive or ""premium"" ammo for either hunting or self-defense, you must still try it out to be sure it functions in your weapon and that you can place the rounds where you need to.

, 9 mm bullets are usually available in loads of either 115, 124, or 147 grains. There are a number of other weights available from bullet manufacturers for special reloading applications. The lighter bullet will generally have a higher velocity, where heavier bullets may have more energy at impact, although this is a variable that also has to have distance factored in. Look for a middle ground weight in your caliber to begin with, then try lighter or heavier bullets according to your needs.

, A 357 Magnum revolver, for instance, can use a .38 caliber bullet, resulting in less noise and recoil and a substantially lower cost for target practice or plinking.

, Factory manufactured ammunition is made with strict quality controls using new brass and bullets, so it is, in most cases, the best choice for the average shooter. There will still be a significant difference in brands, and within brands. Some offer premium loads, target loads, hunting loads, and other levels of quality, and for practical purposes, the cheaper the bullet is, the lower the quality and the expected results achieved with it. Here are some of your options for buying ammo.


Retail stores. Big box stores like Walmart carry handgun ammo at most locations. They may have a limited variety of common calibers at competitive prices, but for specialized rounds or unusual calibers, you will have to look elsewhere.
Sporting goods stores will have a wider selection, and large, chain type stores will also have competitive pricing. One advantage of shopping a sporting goods store with a firearms department is the likelihood the counter help will be more knowledgeable about the products they sell.
Online ammo sellers. Websites like Ammo-to-Go, Cheaper Than Dirt, MidwayUSA, and Scott's Ammo offer wide ranges of calibers and bullet weights, as well as the aforementioned bullet types. They also often offer military surplus at reduced cost, and bulk purchases can further reduce the cost. To get a quick overview of the pricing of online bullets, go to ammoseek.com and enter the caliber you are looking for. They will give you a listing of prices from numerous online ammo sources.
Reloaders. Although people may feel like it is a gamble to buy ammo from a reloader, there are some advantages, particularly with special loads like subsonic ammunition for noise suppression. The main issue, when dealing with a reloader is being familiar with their process. Do they use brass in good condition? Do they accurately meter the power charge? In other words, can you depend on a reloader to produce quality ammunition?

You should be able to load your gun quickly 100% of the time — without looking at your pistol, your hands, or your magazines.,
Emergency reload is the reload in which you have spent all the rounds from your magazine and your slide is locked back.,
Tactical reload is the reload in which you encounter a lull in the gunfight and are able to place yourself behind cover.,
You should be practiced enough that when you are shooting (no matter how many rounds are in the magazine), you should be able to feel when the handgun is empty.",How to Practice Drills with Your Handgun1,";
, This should all be done while keeping your gun pointed at your target. Psychologically, lowering your gun gives your intended target an advantage over you and keeps you focused on your gun rather than on your target.


The technique is as follows: when the slide locks back, you want to grab another magazine (likely from a magazine pouch). As you move the fresh magazine toward the gun, eject the empty magazine letting it hit the ground (they should essentially pass each other during the drill). Place the rear of the magazine against the rear of the magazine well of the gun, align the two, and with some force (though there should be little resistance) seat the magazine using the heel of your palm; then depress the slide release.

, You know you have spent some rounds from the current magazine and want to prepare for whatever may come next.


This drill can be done at the ready, since it should be done from behind cover and the other shooter (target) may be visible, but not an immediate threat. Reach to your magazine pouch (or other magazine holder — a pocket perhaps — and grab a magazine with your thumb, index finger, and middle finger. Move back to the gun and eject the partially depleted magazine into your hand, grabbing the ejected magazine with your ring finger, pinkie, and the palm of your hand. Insert the fresh magazine into the gun and tug on it slightly to make sure that it is seated in the magazine well correctly. (This is especially important when loading a magazine that is topped off.) This reload doesn't require manipulation of the slide release.
This reload should be executed before you re-holster your pistol so if you need to draw again you are fully prepared.

,


The slide has two separate actions every time a round is fired; after the last round is fired you will only feel the first action, ultimately there is less muzzle flip. The quicker you are able to reload the magazine, the better. After this, you execute an emergency reload.

Hop in the water after you suit up with a life jacket and swim trunks.

,
Place the Air Chair into the water.,
Slide your legs in through the seatbelt after you loosen it.,
Move to the edge of the seat, for most people the Air Chair works best if your back is at the back edge of the seat, so you are sitting most of the way off the front of the seat.,
Grab the rope and align it in front of the exposed part of the ski.,
Steer with the rope!,
With the boat pulling you in a straight line, try to the keep the Air Chair straight.,
Lean forward and keep the rope high to remain on the water.,
Steering is the same as when in the water with one addition: leaning.,
Attempt to raise the ski off the water.,
Straighten your back (so you aren't leaning forward or backward), and keep your arms high (this keeps you on the water).,
Practice the basics of controlling your height until you are able to go the full length of the post on command.,
Jump by leaning back.",How to Ride an Air Chair2,", Though the Air Chair is heavy, if the post and blades are attached to the chair correctly, nothing will sink. Only the last few inches of the nose of the ski will be above the surface.


As you approach the Air Chair be wary of the post and blades which are below the surface that you can't see.

, Strap your feet into the booties by pulling the heel strap below your foot and snugly on your heel.

, Once in position, tighten the seatbelt and secure it.

, If you are learning to get up, have the boat drag you very slowly (idle) in a straight line. Try to learn to keep the Air Chair pointed in the correct direction.

, The Air Chair uses leverage as it's primary means of control. Move the rope to the right and it will pull you to the left, and vice versa. Control the angle of the Air Chair by compensating with the location of the rope. This will take a lot of practice to perfect.


The driver of the boat will have to be patience (as will you) because you will get turned sideways more than once and you will fall, once up, more than once!

, As the boat accelerates (after you say, ""Hit it!"" (or whatever your ""go"" phrase is) keep your back straight (perpendicular to the ski), your arms outstretched and make and minor adjustments to your direction with the location of the rope (read above). As soon as the ski has planed (no longer being pulled through the water — but on top of it), lean forward to keep the ski down on the water.

, This is the best way to learn the basics of steering and control.

, Like a bicycle, you must lean and turn at the same time. But unlike skiing or wakeboarding, if you only lean to turn you will likely fall. You must turn (using the rope), then lean into the turn to compensate for the forces put on the rope. This all becomes even more important when riding on the hydrofoil rather than the ski.

, At first it is usually best to try leaning back to bring the ski off the water. As soon as you are off the water, lean forward again to bring it back down. Keep your arms steady for now (don't move them higher or lower). Try leaning back and forth until you get more comfortable with the idea of being above the water.

, Lower your arms until you start lifting off the water, then bring it back down by raising the rope again. Practice this a few times until you are able to comfortably control your height off the water just by using your arms (remember, if you need to go down in an emergency, you can lean forward).

, Be aware that going to high will most likely cause you to crash as air being caught under the hydrofoil will remove all lift and will bring you down to the ski in a hurry. The picture at right is an example of what happens after you go too high.


Cutting (turning to the extremities of the usable water) is a unique experience among water sports. The Air Chair requires a good deal of balance and control to maneuver over the wake then to keep level as the rope pulls you at more of an angle. The rope has been keeping you level while behind the boat, but as the rope pulls at nearly a perpendicular angle to your motion, the downward leverage is gone. You must compensate by leaning forward or back to keep level.

, This is a bit of giant leap from the rest of the article, but it is a natural progression, and learning to jump is very easy, it is the landing that is very difficult. Land by leaning back until your descent is slowed then straighten your back and control your elevation with the rope.

Realize that the ""best"" ammo will change according to purpose: Hunting?,
Try a limited number of rounds before buying a stock pile of one particular type of bullet.,
Read online resources or print publications for detailed information about bullet energy, ballistic data, and specific data about what weights of bullets are available for individual caliber guns.

",How to Pick Pistol Ammo2," Target shooting? Self-defense? Cheapest for shooting lots of ammunition for fun? All these are different tasks, and take different ammo to do the job best. Not to mention, some firearms will tolerate very ""hot"" loads, while others will be rapidly worn-out by shooting ""hot"" ammunition. A dealer or gunsmith can guide someone on a case-by-case, pistol-by-pistol basis.

, You may find a round shoots dirty, doesn't shoot well in your gun, or for other reasons don't meet your expectations. This trial and error is the best way to refine your choice in the long run.

Look at the following list of questions you can ask yourself when you are deciding on a bullet.",How to Pick Pistol Ammo3," This assumes you have done some homework and tested different rounds.


Does it operate reliably (no jams)?
Does it shoot accurately out of the pistol? (This is a little hard to tell. It takes a lot of practice to be good enough to know that this good group and that bad group are due to ammunition differences, rather than because the shooter was more tired when he shot the bad group, or whatever else might have caused it, but if someone is good, they'll know.)
Is the ammunition designed to do the job the shooter has in mind? (Like, is it a good defense round, or a good target-shooting round, or a good hunting round... and for this, most folks depend on their dealer or on advertising. But if you buy ammunition that is designed to be, say, for self-defense, then check or reliability and accuracy, and you're probably ok.)

"
Position yourself about 7-yards (the distance the FBI determined a man could move in a second and a half — about the time it takes to draw a pistol and fire) away from a large (10+ inch) target.,
The next stage is to put bursts into the target.,
Practice with multiple targets.,
Practice while moving.,
Integrate the Mozambique Drill.",How to Practice Drills with Your Handgun2," In a lowered gun stance (ready position), pull your gun up, as quickly as possible, to firing position and focus hard on the front sight of your gun, wait until you see a bit of the front sight between the rear sights and pull the trigger (this is called flash sighting). You should be able to land a hit in the 10-inch target every time. If you are missing try going a little slower. The key is to practice perfectly, and the speed will come naturally.

, Take a few steps back (go for 10 yards). Do the same things as before, but this time, put two or three shots quickly into your target, between each shot, get the flash sight again. Once you are able to get to firing position and put three quick shots into your 10+ inch target consistently in under a second-and-a-half, you can move on.

, You want to start by setting up three or more targets a yard or two apart. Quick to firing position and go down the line. One shot at each target. Change it up: maybe try in a different order; have a friend tell you which one to shoot (""one!"", ""three!"", etc.), but the key thing to be sure of is that you hit your target; once you are sure you can hit your target every time, try to accelerate your pace. At first when you fire move the gun with the recoil. As soon as the recoil is completed you should be on the next target already. As you get faster you can force the gun into position and be ready before the recoil is complete.

, While moving, you should still be able to hit targets at 10 yards (9.1 m). Set up three or more targets about a few yards apart from each other. Start about 15–18 yards (13.7–16.5 m) back. Run up to about 10 yards (from your first target) while drawing your gun to firing position. Fire a two-shot burst, side-step to engage the next target, and so on. Each time you run the course, try to do it faster; try to pause as little as possible when shooting (even while moving you should be able to get a flash sight), the longer you pause the more accurate you will be, but in a gun fight, the clock is always ticking quicker than at the range.

, If a friend is calling out target numbers, and they call the number of a target you have already shot, this time you go for a head shot. This is also known as ""failure to stop"" practice. The idea is, you have shot the target, but he isn't impressed (i.e. he is on drugs, is wearing body armor, or is just plain determined) and keeps coming, so you have to take a head shot. Read Human Targets below for more information.

"
"
Bullet placement is much more important than the bullet itself.,
The thoracic cavity is the ""center of mass"" in a human.,
The second major area is the cranial cavity.,
For practice, replacing the circular chest target with a dome-shaped 11x7-inch target and the head with a 3x5-inch target will get you a more realistic targeting area.",How to Practice Drills with Your Handgun3," There are two critical areas of a human which contain major organs and vitals which, if shot, can stop a man in his tracks or kill him.

, This area contains the heart, major veins and arteries, the trachea, bronchi and lungs, the esophagus, and structures of the nervous system including the paired vagus nerves. To imagine the area that this encompasses it starts above the diaphragm (just below the sternum) and makes (from a frontal view) a dome shape up to the first lateral rib. This is a pretty large target area. A shot in one area of the thoracic cavity is little different any another, unless you hit the heart.


The problem with shots in the thoracic cavity is that a determined fighter or a man on drugs will be less than impressed with anything you throw at him in this area. Even if you destroy a person's heart they still have 20 to 30 seconds of full cognitive and physical ability with which they could severely hurt or even kill you. Additionally the heart is a very small target and completely destroying the heart with one bullet is nearly impossible, which means that they will likely have even more time before their eventual fate is achieved. For all these reasons, many have the self-defense rule: ""shoot until the threat ends."" But you must determine for yourself what your protocol will be.
Body armor is also a factor. Just hitting a man in the chest (unless you hit him in the exact same place every time) is just going to deplete your magazine.

Bullet penetration is a very key factory in bullet selection. This penetration does a few things for you. At less than optimal angles, the bullet will still reach vitals, and it will give your bullet a chance to possibly hit their spine, which (depending on where it lands) can incapacitate them completely or at least part of their body, enough so you may be able to get away.

, This area is much simpler; it contains the brain and upper spine.


While the brain is an obvious target, there are still some considerations in shot placement. The front of the cranium (above the eyebrows) is one of the hardest bones in the body, it is also not a flat target (it is angled back slightly, or on the sides: angled to the side). There have been instances where bullets have ricocheted off a person's forehead.
Luckily, just below this bone (below the eyebrows), down to the top of the upper-jaw is a very soft area with cartilage and holes which lead directly to the lower brain, the medulla oblongata, and the upper spine. The brain is the largest target, and a bullet in there will mean lights out, but flinching and minor movements have been known to occur when a brain shot is incurred. The medulla oblongata and the upper spine is how those flinching signals are sent to the body. A bullet through either one of those, and there is no way the body might accidentally pull a trigger or move in some other potentially detrimental way.
In a situation which requires the immediate and unquestioned incapacitation of a person, a shot through an approximately 3-inch (above the upper-jaw to eyebrows) by 5-inch (the outside edges of the eyes) window in the head is essential. This 3x5-inch area is about the same no matter what angle the person is facing you at (from the rear and the sides it is about the same size and about the same level on the head).

, When scoring (to compare your improvements) or competing, a shot breaking the line of either cavity is good. The size of the grouping should matter less than getting the hits in quickly; and when shooting at the cranial cavity, only a guaranteed shot should be taken (you should always take more time for a cranial shot than a thoracic shot). But keep in mind, ""remember your worst day at the range, you will be twice as bad when you are in a gun fight."" So a general rule of a hand-sized grouping in the thoracic is optimal.

Glock and other Constant Double Action (DAO) pistols (such as QA Walthers, LEM, and DKA triggers) have a trigger which has a reset-point after the gun has been fired.,
Most other pistols (single-action—SA, double-action—DA, double/single-action—DA/SA) are a bit more standard.,
After you have your trigger pull down.,
The process of the gun when you fire a bullet is such: bullet is fired, slide racks back, shell ejected, as the slide moves forward the rest of the gun (frame, barrel, etc.),
If you pull the trigger before the gun is at rest in your hands you will shoot higher than the first bullet.,
With some practice you will find you can do 10–12 inch (25.4–30.5 cm) groupings at 7 yards (6.4 m).",How to Practice Drills with Your Handgun4," Fire a round at your target; now, slowly release the trigger until you hear a click, and resistance on the trigger is lessened. At this point you can pull the trigger again. This not only allows you to be more accurate while doing single-shots (due to the shorter trigger pull), but when you get your finger used to the motion, it is the best way to shoot the gun quickly.

, You have to release the trigger completely before it can be pulled again. SA and DA/SA will be easiest for this drill, as they will have lighter trigger pulls than their DA (or DAO) counterparts.

, The first thing is to practice (at close range — 4-8 yards) shooting the gun as fast as possible. The faster you can pull the trigger the more options it leaves for you.

, raises (this is called muzzle flip), as soon as the slide is back in battery (full-forward) the gun can fire again. The final slide position happens before the gun has gone back to its original position in your hands.

, If you wait too long, the gun will actually bounce below the original position, firing during that stage will cause the bullet to land low. You can either wait a bit longer (but that removes the word ""rapid"" from this drill), or you can time the firing to when the gun is falling past the rest position.


You can also increase the cycle speed of gun in your hands by getting a tighter/firmer grip on the gun (too firm for accurate single-shot shooting). If you do this, timing is more important, but it allows you to shoot faster.
Note that each gun, and each caliber will have totally different cycle times, so being practiced with few handguns is best. If you get the timing wrong, you will find hitting a target consistently even at 5 yards (4.6 m) can become difficult.
If your bullets are hitting high after the first one, try shooting a bit slower. You can alternatively try tightening your grip on the gun. If you are shooting low, either shoot faster or loosen your grip on the gun.

, Once you are able to do that, or get close to that, you can add other drills: setup two or more targets. Fire four or five rounds at one target, then turn to the next target and so on. This combines one of the earlier-mentioned shooting drills and the rapid fire drill.

Always keep the gun pointed in a safe direction. A safe direction means that the gun is pointed in such a way that an accidental fire would not cause any harm.Obey the step until it becomes second nature to keep the gun pointed in a safe direction, even when you know the gun is unloaded.
Always keep your finger off the trigger until ready to shoot. You initial gripping and aiming of the revolver does not require you to have your finger on the trigger, so keep your finger on the outside of the trigger guard until you are truly ready to shoot.Always keep the gun unloaded until ready to use. You do not want to store or transport your revolver while it is loaded—wait until you are at the shooting range and ready to begin.Always be aware of both your target and what is beyond it.Read and follow any additional rules specific to your shooting range. If they do not have rules posted, ask for a copy of their range rules before they assign you a lane.If you are purchasing your own revolver, ensure that you have a way to store the weapon so that it’s only accessible to authorized persons such as with a gun safe.;
, Depending on the type of revolver you have, the cylinder may swing out or there may be a loading gate or “trap door” that swings away from the rear of the cylinder.


If the cylinder on your revolver swings out, there will be a release on the cylinder that is typically located on the left side of the revolver behind the cylinder—just above the area your thumb would rest if you’re holding the gun in your right hand.The cylinder will also typically swing out to the left of the gun rather than the right.
If your revolver has a loading gate or trap door, then you open the loading gate, which is most often at the back of the cylinder and rotates down to the right.This style of revolver is most often associated with classic single-action revolver remakes. You may also have to pull the hammer back to half-cock—the first click—in order to freely spin the cylinder.

, Turn the cylinder to ensure that each chamber is clear of a previous round. Always check this from the rear of the cylinder and never by looking down the chambers with the barrel end facing you.Most revolvers have a convenient ejector to empty the chambers. The ejector is the pin at the front center of the cylinder. You can push down on the ejector pin to eject spent cartridges or to unload live rounds when the revolver is not in use., Most revolvers will have five or six chambers in the cylinder. Place a round in each chamber in the cylinder.


For a revolver with a loading gate, the gate only gives you access to one chamber at a time, so you will have to rotate the cylinder manually before you can insert each round.For this style of single-action revolver, the safest method is also considered to be loading all chambers but one and lowering the hammer on the unloaded chamber until you are ready to shoot., You are now ready to close the cylinder. For a cylinder that swings out, you can simply push it up and to the right until it clicks back into place. For a single-action-style revolver, you will turn the cylinder until the empty chamber faces the top of the cylinder, close the loading gate, hold the half-cocked hammer with your thumb while you release the tension on it by pulling the trigger, and slowly lowering the hammer over the empty chamber.If you are new to single-action revolvers, then you may want to have an expert at your local shooting range show you the process.

, You will feel the majority of the recoil from the revolver in your hands and arms. It will by no means take you off your balance. However, you will have an easier time aiming with your feet firmly planted at a relatively wide base, about shoulder-width apart.

, You want your dominant hand around the handle of the revolver first. You also want to keep your hand relatively high up on the handle so that your thumb can wrap around to the opposite side.The lower your hand is around the grip of the revolver, the more the recoil will push the gun up instead of back, which will take you longer to aim again.Do not yet place your finger on the trigger. Keep your index finger on the outside of the trigger guard until you are ready to shoot.

, Some people want to put their non dominant hand around the bottom of the grip, but this does not help with recoil. Instead, place your non dominant hand around the grip as well to help support your dominant hand.With this grip, the thumb on your non dominant hand will rest on top of your dominant hand thumb.

, At this point, you’re ready to bring the gun up, so make sure you bring it up to face the target and nowhere else. Don’t lock your elbows, but straighten and extend them to bring the revolver out in front of you. The ideal location is to bring the revolver all the way up to eye level and with a straight line to your dominant eye.This allows you to aim comfortably without having to turn your head or neck.

, This step only applies to single-action revolvers where you must manually pull the hammer back to cock the gun before you can fire. With your hands still on the grip, use your thumb to pull the hammer back until the second click. The first click is only the half-cocked stage used for loading the revolver.


Make sure the revolver is already pointed downrange at your target before even touching the hammer. You do not want an accident discharge going in any direction but down the shooting range.

, There are normally two sights on a firearm. A front sight and a rear sight. The front sight is a small, fixed ""blade"" and the rear sight looks like a valley or a notch. To aim the revolver, place the front blade on the target, and then place the front blade in between the ""valley"" back sights.The front sight alone ensures that you don’t hit to the left of right of the target, and making sure that the rear sight is also in alignment ensures that you do not hit above or below the target.


Once you line up the target, you may be tempted to shift your focus back on the target and away from the sights, but even small movements will have an effect on your aim. Keep your focus on the front sight even if it means the target beyond it is a tiny bit unfocused.

, With your grip right and the revolver pointed downrange toward the target, you can now place your dominant index finger inside the trigger guard. Touch the trigger but no not place any pressure on it.


You want to use the pad of your index finger and not the crease of the first knuckle., Aiming any gun can be a slow, precise process, especially for people new to marksmanship. One of the biggest mistakes people make is to try to hold their breath as they aim and shoot. Keep breathing and stay aware of your breathing. You ideally want to squeeze the trigger at the natural pause between the end of your exhalation and the beginning of your next inhalation., You do not want to jerk your finger back on the trigger because this will surely mess up your precision aiming. Instead, gently squeeze the trigger with the pad of your index finger while keeping the rest of your grip steady and your focus on aiming.


Don’t panic about the recoil of the revolver as you squeeze. Your solid, firm grip on the gun handle and your arm strength will cushion most of the recoil. Tensing up as you know the gun is about to fire is a sure way to mess up your aim as the revolver shoots.

, With the proper grip on the revolver, the recoil will push slightly more back than up. Keep your wrists locked and forearms tensed, as you had them for your shooting stance, and you will naturally absorb most of the recoil. However, you will definitely still need to take aim again before firing another round.

The cartridges in a revolver are loaded into a cylinder in the middle of the frame of the gun. A capacity of six is most common but some hold five and are designed to fit smaller hands. A semi-automatic pistol has a sliding mechanism at the top of the handgun and a magazine of pre-loaded ammunition in the handle. Operation of each type of handgun differ slightly so it's important to clearly define terms before handling a gun.


Revolvers have a revolving cylinder for holding the ammunition. The ammunition is loaded into the cylinder, then the cylinder swings into the revolver and it is ready to fire. After a bullet is fired, the cylinder rotates and lines up the next cartridge in line with the firing pin. Most revolvers can be fired in a double action mode which is pulling the trigger which rotates the hammer until it falls and fires the cartridge. Additionally, the hammer can be pulled back into position before the trigger is pulled, this results in a much lighter trigger pull and improves accuracy. In order to retrieve the spent cartridges, the cylinder is rotated outwards allowing the empty ammunitions to be removed.
A semi-automatic pistol advances each cartridge into the chamber from the magazine. It then ejects the empty cartridge after it has been fired. The slide on the top of the gun is used to advance the first shell into the chamber, and can be locked in the back position with a button or pin on the side. The removable magazine is removed and loaded separately.;
, Handguns come in many varieties with a seemingly endless array of ammunition options. Also, consider your body, hand size and purpose of your handgun.


You probably don't need a .357 Magnum to try out target shooting at the gun range. Avoid buying an overly large high-caliber gun if you're interested in getting started, and instead get a small-caliber reliable gun, like a .22. Talk to dealers and others experienced with firearms for recommendations.

, Headphone-style ear protection and earplugs will protect against the noise of the gunshots. Safety goggles will protect the eyes from flying shells, hot gasses and lead particles that are ejected from a semi-automatic handgun.


Wear safety goggles even if you already wear glasses. Safety goggles are designed to protect you in a way your glasses won't.

, When handling a handgun, always keep it pointed downrange. Do not use a gun range unless there is an appropriate backdrop and safety equipment.


Be careful of all safety consideration while at the range. It is not only important to practice good gun safety, you must be aware of what those around you are doing. Many beginners struggle pulling the slide back with a semi-automatic with just their thumb and forefinger, especially if the handgun has a strong spring or your hands are sweaty. If you need to use the palm of your hand (or your whole hand) to pull back the slide, turn your body sideways to the weapon and keep it pointed downrange.

, ANY time you pick up a handgun you need to check to see if it is loaded. Even when you first bring it home from the store, check to see if it is loaded. If you got it out of the closet for the first time in ten years, check to see if it is loaded. If you just unloaded it, check to see if it is loaded. And, always check any gun that is given to you by anybody at anytime. Failure to do this can result in serious damage to property, injury to people and death!


With a revolver, release the cylinder and rotate it to the side. All the chambers should be empty. In a semi-automatic pistol, remove the magazine from the gun and pull the slide back to look into the chamber to make sure there isn't a cartridge in the firing chamber. If there is, racking the slide should eject it.
Keep the slide in the back position while you practice holding the gun to be sure it's unloaded and to get used to keeping your thumb out of the way of the slide's action.

, Whenever you handle it, make sure the barrel is pointed downrange, which should be clear of people. Outdoors, always keep your handgun pointed downwards, never up. A bullet fired up by accident will come down and may injure someone.


NEVER point any gun at anyone even if it is unloaded, and even as a joke. Pointing a gun at someone is a crime in some states and the stupidest thing you can ever do. There will be times you believe it to be unloaded when it is. Practice holding the gun at the range with the gun unloaded.

, Taking the pistol in your other hand, insert the grip (handle) of the pistol into the web of your dominant hand. With your thumb on one side of the grip, keep your middle, ring, and pinky fingers curled securely around the other side just below the trigger guard.


You are really gripping the gun only with the middle and ring fingers, the ""pinky"" is resting on the gun but is not used to grip; neither is the thumb used to grip the gun. The grip should be firm but not tight. If you're gripping it so tightly that the gun shakes, you will not be able to accurate control it.

, Your non dominant hand should be held underneath the handgun providing support for the weight of the gun. Place your index finger on the bottom of the trigger guard or in front of it, wherever is most comfortable.

, Some older semi automatics have a habit of 'biting' the web between your index finger and thumb. Getting ""bitten"" by the slide can be very painful as well as dangerous, because you don't want to react to pain and risk dropping a loaded and cocked gun with the safety off.

, Your feet should be shoulder-width apart, with the foot opposite your dominant hand about a step past the other foot. Lean forward slightly with your knees bent, making sure you’re firmly balanced. The elbow of your dominant arm should be almost straight and your non-dominant elbow should be flexed at a slightly obtuse angle. Your dominant arm must be in line with the handgun and pointed at the target.


Some shooting matches are done one-handed (off hand). In those events, the stance is more ""open"" with the gun arm and the body in almost a straight line to as much as about 90-degrees, the dominant foot toward the target. A firm grip on the gun is more important since you are not using the other hand for support.
Never aim the gun sideways or with a bent wrist like in the movies. This is extremely dangerous and unsteady!

, Ensure that the top of the front sight post is level with the top of the rear sight, and that the rear sight appears evenly centered within the notch of the front sight. This will ensure that the gun is level and that you'll get a good ""sight picture"" when aiming at the target.


It is most common to aim by using your dominant eye and closing the other. For other events where depth perception is important, practice aiming with both eyes open. You will need to learn to ignore the picture from you non dominant eye while still seeing the depth.

, When shooting, a common confusion is where to focus.On the the target? On the sight? On the target? After leveling the handgun and ensuring your firearm is aimed correctly you will need to focus on the target or placing your shot accurately is impossible.

, You should see the sharply focused front sight touching the bottom of the blurry, unfocused bulls-eye. Now you place your trigger finger on the trigger.

, When you're ready to shoot and you've practiced aiming and steadying the gun and developing a good sight picture, load the gun. Keep the safety on when loading the gun (if your gun has one) and remove it when you're in the firing position with your gun pointed at the target. Keep the barrel of the gun pointed downrange the entire time you load the gun! Most shooting accidents happen during loading and unloading a handgun.


If the pistol is a semi-automatic, you'll need to load a round into the chamber by pulling back the slide and releasing it.

, Shortly before firing the handgun, after you have carefully aimed it, you will need to take a deep breath and hold it. Calm your body. Looking at how the sights will be moving, you will notice that it traces a small figure eight pattern. This is due to the beating of your heart. In order to ensure you can see your aim point, pull the trigger when the sights come to the bottom of the figure eight. By the time you are finished pulling the trigger, the sights should be at the aim point. From the time you hold your breath to the time you pull the trigger should be short but not rapid or hurried.

, Every sport has ""follow-through"" and target shooting is no exception. As you squeeze the trigger the gun will fire, but don't release the trigger suddenly or relax your posture, your stance or your arms. Be still. Release the trigger after you've taken a breath and prepare for the next shot.


Follow-through action improves accuracy and reduces shot variation, just as follow-through does for a golfer or a tennis player.

, Take your time between rounds. There is no hurry.It is better to get a few accurate hits than to get many bad shots. You are at the range to get better, not turn money into noise.

, With the gun still in firing position, click the safety back in place (if your handgun has one) and remember to keep the gun pointed downrange while you unload it. For revolvers, check the cylinder to ensure there are no rounds in it or remove any that are. Release the magazine from a semi-automatic pistol and rack the slide to eject any shells that may be in the chamber.

This drill can be added prior to any other drill.,
Most semi-automatic pistols will not fire if the slide on the gun is not in battery (full-forward) position.,
Charging a bad guy seems like a stupid idea in most cases, but if the bad guy is reloading, or otherwise distracted, it can be of great benefit (you may be able to catch them by surprise or disarm them).",How to Practice Drills with Your Handgun5," It is designed to get your heart rate up and maybe some adrenaline going which will give you a mild tunnel vision effect. Before you do a drill, with your firearm securely holstered, do 20 or more push ups. Go until you have a bit of a burn and you are getting out of breath. Jump up and do your drill as soon after as possible. You will find that acute aiming is much more difficult, though general flash sight aiming shouldn't be too much different; this is why it is so important.

, This becomes a problem if your pistol is resting against something or the front of the gun is pressed into something soft. A simple drill to keep the bad guy off of your gun in a close quarter situation is to put your support arm straight in front of your chest bent at a 90-degree angle. This keeps the bad guy off you, while your firing arm is lowered near your hip. For practice: a tall target you can lean up against your arm and fire into it is good (make sure the target is soft, so the bullets don't ricochet and it doesn't splinter — make sure you shoot straight forward so you don't hit your arm). A couple times is all you need with this drill, just to give you the feel.

, Have a center-chest-sized target (10+ inches) setup 15–20 yards (13.7–18.3 m) away. Start your sprint at it, when you feel you are close enough to hit the target while moving, slow down to a crouched walk with your knees slightly bent (to keep your upper body smooth) and shoot the target.


Add different things while running: have a friend tell you when to start shooting (at random times). Or start running at the same time a friend starts reloading. Have the friend yell when he is done to let you know to start shooting. It can become a reloading vs. sprinting contest (it will also give you an idea of how long a reload feels like if you need to rush someone).
If your location allows, stand 15–20 yards (13.7–18.3 m) away from your target. Have another person stand well off to the side pointing at a different target. The person standing to the side will have one round in the chamber and an empty magazine, with a loaded magazine in easy access (i.e. magazine pouch). You should have your gun out at and the ready. The other person will fire; you start running at your target. When you are close enough to get good hits, you shoot; if the other person is able to reload and fire at his target before you shoot, he wins. It is best (for safety reasons) for the other person to be aimed and shooting at a target which is different direction than yours, so at no time will one person be in front of someone else's muzzle.
Additionally, you can try reloading while running at the target, then shoot the target when you are done (this is the most advanced version of this drill).

If there is no click, look at the malfunction and act accordingly (remember it may be an empty magazine too). After shooting for some time you should be able to feel when the magazine is depleted, allowing you to execute emergency reloads very quickly.

Practice:


Load a full magazine into the gun with an empty chamber.",How to Reload a Pistol and Clear Malfunctions3," Often a type-1 malfunction is a misfeed, in which a round was not loaded into the chamber (e.g. you didn't rack the slide after you loaded a magazine, or the magazine wasn't seated enough to load a round).

, This is a relatively dangerous malfunction where there is not enough force to propel the projectile out of the barrel. In semi-automatic pistols, a squib is often easily noticeable, as the slide will not cycle and a new round will not be chambered. If a squib load happens, remove the magazine and clear the obstruction immediately.

, Only attempt to immediately clear the malfunction during a live-fire, real confrontation. This is due to the risk of the round eventually firing. If you experience a hang fire, keep the firearm pointed down range for at least 10 seconds before attempting to clear.

, The quickest way to do this is through immediate action. With a semi-automatic pistol, pull the slide back, ejecting the last round. Observe the ejection and the round. If the lead is still on the bullet, you know that the round didn't fire. If the lead is gone, it may indicate a weapon malfunction. Observe the chamber. Check for double feeds, or things that don't belong. Release the slide, seating the next round. Deactivate the safety and attempt to fire the weapon. If it still fails to fire, remove the magazine and eject the current round, and turn the weapon over to a gun expert for repair.

It's often better to spend a little more on the mount than on the scope itself, so you won't have to continually adjust things when you've got it sighted in.


To install the mount, you'll tighten the screws into the mounts according to the manufacturer directions. It's best to proceed in an X pattern, so that you are not pulling the scope one way or the other. Start the screws loosely at first, so you can make adjustments if necessary.;
, Lay the scope into the bracket, according to the manufacturer's directions, with the eyepiece oriented in the correct direction. Use a small torpedo level, laying it on the top of your scope to check for level, and tightening the rings firmly.








, Set the distance to your shooting eye so the position is correct when in your shooting position. Your image should be sharp and clear when you look through the eyepiece, when this is achieved your know you are in the correct place.








, Your rifle should be held in a steady position, mounted on a stand so that the rifle stock is level and square to the ground level. Start rotating the cross-hair so that the vertical cross-hair is at top dead center, or 12 o'clock.









Imagine a line through the cross-hair that runs directly through the center of your rifle. You can make further adjustments later, but it's important to get the cross-hairs oriented in the correct position now, before you tighten it down.

, Make sure that the cross-hair remains top dead center, then gradually tighten your mounting rings. Tighten each screw only half a thread at a time constantly checking the cross-hair hasn't moved. Go slowly.

, The only way to accurately sight-in a rifle scope is to shoot it from a variety of positions. The easiest way to do this is at the gun range, typically, where you can be sure of the distances and your backstops. As always, practice good gun safety while you're handling a firearm and bring eye protection and ear protection, as well as enough ammunition for a day of shooting.


Use a bulls-eye target specifically for zeroing. These will typically have lots of measurements that will let you make accurate adjustments on the rifle. The more sure how ""off"" each hit is, the more accurately you'll be able to sight it in.
Follow the specific regulations and rules at the range at which you're shooting.

, When you're zeroing a rifle, you need to eliminate user-error from the equation as much as possible. In other words, you can't miss. To give yourself the most accurate zero, you need to mount your gun into a rest specifically for this purpose, which are available at all sporting goods outlets, and may be available at a gun club near you, which you can borrow. All the more reason to head to the range.


If you don't have a solid gun rest, get in as solid a position for shooting as possible. Even just setting up a couple of steady books, or your boots, or your jacket, will help you to rest the gun on something and shoot more accurately. Just make sure whatever you're resting it on is clear of the bolt.

, Wait for the signal that the range is hot, and look through your scope, training the sight on the bulls-eye. Using a proper stock to cheek weld and maintain the same sight picture as you usually do. Take the safety off the rifle. At the end of your exhale, hold for a split-second, then squeeze the trigger firmly without jerking it for the most accurate shot. Repeat 3-5 times for the most accurate first run.







, Wait for the signal that the range is cold, then safety and unload your rifle, checking it twice to be sure. Retrieve your target, or examine it through a range sight to get an accurate picture of your shots. The adjustments you

, Return to your rifle, and make adjustments using the adjustment knobs on the top and one side of the scope. Each scope will have a slightly different mechanism for making adjustments, but the principles are basically the same. For specific instructions about adjusting the zero, read the next section.









Once you've made your adjustments, repeat this process. Fire a few more rounds, check the grouping, and readjust. That's the process.
It's a good idea to mark the holes in the target that you've already made, so you don't get confused later, or to use a new target. Some targets come with four or five different bullseye, just for this process.

, Generally speaking, most marksmen will want to sight-in the rifle from a variety of different positions, focusing most on the distances at which you'll be likely to fire. The same basic process and adjustments can be made at each position, but you'll probably want to measure from at least two, and probably more like three or four distances.


Start at 20 yards (18.3 m), then move out to about 75. Try not to move more than 50 yards (45.7 m) at a time, to keep yourself making little adjustments. If you have time and feel like you could still make more adjustments, you can move into the 200–300 yard (180–270 m) range and get ambitious. At that point, however, wind will be a big factor., Most scopes should have two dials on it, one on the top and one on the side, which are used to adjust the scope and will allow you to zero it, so what you're seeing and where the rifle is aimed will be in line. The top knob is used to adjust the up and down of the cross-hairs, and the one on the side will adjust the scope left to right.


On some older sights, you'll need to use a penny or a small key to turn the knobs gently, though on most sights you can just use your fingers to twist the knob, like a dial.

, If you missed high, adjust the scope to go higher. If you missed left, adjust the scope toward the left. Continue making the necessary adjustments until your secured and steady rifle is hitting bull's eye regularly, then move elsewhere on the range to try from another distance.

, On most scopes, each click you turn either dial that moves the zero 1/4"", so four clicks of the knob would be about an inch. Read the user manual that came with your scope to be sure about adjustments, but always move little.

, If you have access to a laser bore sighter that will save you a lot of ammo and less wear on the shoulder. If not, take your rifle it to your local sporting goods dealer and have them bore sight it. It's a very inexpensive process that will result in a pretty accurate rifle.


Once the gun has been bore sighted and is ready to shoot you should still test it yourself using these directions and make the necessary adjustments. Some difference will come from different user variables.

Choose what type of optics or sights to use.,
Pick your ammunition.,
Choose your zero distance.,
Use a laser bore sighter.,
Consider utilizing a shooting rest.",How to Zero a Rifle1," There are a number of different options of types of sights to use on your rifle, and even more options within each type. Choosing the correct sight for you requires considering what type of shooting you want to do, at what distance, and what your preferences are. Some people prefer traditional iron sights, while others like to use high magnification scopes, and everything in between.Iron sights are the sights that usually come on the rifle and include a rear sight aperture and a front sight tip. They are used primarily for short distance shooting, but can be accurate at nearly any range.
Red dot optics involve projecting a red dot onto a lens in the sights you are using. This red dot, or floating reticle, shows you on the lens where the target should impact. Red dots are used mostly for short to medium range shooting.
Magnification optics use a lens to show you a magnified view of the target. They are used for long distance shooting primarily.;
, Different types of ammunition will affect the flight path of the round you fire from your rifle, so it’s important that you choose a type of ammunition and stick to it throughout the process of zeroing your rifle. Being consistent with your ammunition choices removes a variable that could affect where the round hits the target, so you can make adjustments more precisely.Different types of ammunition may use different propellants or amounts of propellants, which can make the round travel faster, limiting the arc of the round and affecting its point of impact.
When zeroing a rifle, you want to be as consistent as possible with the equipment and methods you use.

, As a round flies downrange, it travels in an arc. Think of the round you fire as a football. It travels upward slightly before arcing and traveling back downward. The distance you choose to zero the rifle at will determine what portion of the arced flight path the round impacts the target on. You can only zero your rifle correctly for one distance, so choose one that approximates the distances you intend to be from your targets in the future. You will still be able to sight in on targets at any distance, but will need to adjust your aiming based on the distance your rifle is zeroed for.Zeroing at a shorter distance like 25 or 50 meters will mean the round is traveling upward at a steeper angle, so it will be sighted high for longer distances. If you will primarily be shooting at short range targets, this is your best option.
Zeroing at a longer distance means the round will be on a downward slope when it impacts the target, so you will be aimed low for closer targets. If you will primarily be shooting at long distance targets, this is your best option.
Many people choose to zero their rifles for one hundred yards, but you should choose your zero distance based how you intend to be shooting.

, In order to zero your rifle, you must first get your rounds “on paper.” Getting on paper means hitting the target anywhere, so you can see where the rounds impact and make adjustments to your sights to bring those rounds closer to the bullseye. A laser bore sighter is a laser pointer that’s designed to be shaped like a round you would load into your rifle. Turn it on and then load the rifle with the bore sighter, the red dot will show exactly where the barrel is pointed on the target. It should provide you with enough accuracy to get on paper with your first rounds.Look through your sights at the red dot, then adjust the sights until the red dot is centered in your scope or sights.
Remember that the bullet won’t actually travel in a straight line, so this method will only get your sights close enough to begin the zeroing process.

, Competition shooting rests absorb recoil and keep the rifle exactly in place while you shoot. One of the biggest obstacles shooters must overcome is a moving rifle. When holding a rifle up, or even supporting it with your bone structure, your body will sway slightly with your breathing and heart rate. These small movements can dramatically effect accuracy at a distance. Shooting rests hold the rifle in place for you, so you can be sure you aren’t moving it when firing.Equipment like bore sighters and shooting rests are not required to zero a rifle, but can provide a big help, especially for inexperienced shooters.
Some rifle ranges may have shooting rests you can use, so you won’t have to purchase one.

Load it.,
Cock it.,
Aim it.,
Prepare for the next shot.",How to Use a Lever Action Rifle," There are many different ways lever action rifles hold ammunition. Many have tubular magazines, located directly below and running along the length of the barrel.


Loading a tubular magazine is simple. Most are either fitted with a spring-loaded plunger mechanism that holds the loaded cartridges in place, or a simple rotating shroud. To load cartridges into a tubular magazine, find the release mechanism that will either rotate a small shield, revealing a port in the tube to allow the insertion on new cartridges, or that will release the plunger which should be removed, similarly revealing a loading port. After loading the magazine, close the rotating shield or re-insert the plunger. Most tube magazines are constructed so that ammunition can only be inserted in the correct direction (usually with the bullet facing the 'forward' direction');
, This is done by pulling down the lever and then pulling it back up. Be sure to move the lever through its full range of motion to ensure that the action is fully cycled. If a spent casing was already in the chamber, it will be ejected and a new round will be loaded from the magazine. Otherwise, a new round with simply be loaded into the chamber.

, Know how to Aim a Rifle. If you have fixed sights, align the rear sights with the front sight. If the rifle too heavy and is hurting your arms or shoulders, try firing from the prone position or bracing the rifle on a solid, stable object.

, You will have to cock it, following step 2, in between each shot. Once you pull it down, it ejects the last spent casing, and pulling the lever up prepares the next shot.

Be sure that your scope is mounted properly.,
Know your rifle.,
Most eyepieces have a lock ring.,
Adjust the objective for infinity (very far, often a small 8 symbol).,
Point the scope toward a blank wall or the sky.,
Once the eyepiece has a sharp reticle image, lock the eyepiece adjustment with the lock ring.,
Adjust the objective.,
You should now be able to move your eye from side-to-side while the rifle stays still and the cross-hairs of the reticle should not move on the target.",How to Use Adjustable Objective Rifle Scopes," Sighting-in can have been done preliminarily, but additional sighting-in will be desirable after following these steps:;
, There are actually two optical systems in a rifle scope. The objective (front lens) focuses the target image on the reticle (cross-hairs); the eyepiece (rear lens) focuses the eye on the reticle. The eyepiece must first be adjusted before any adjustment of the objective.

, Unscrew the lock ring a turn or two so that the eyepiece can be screwed in and out.

, This will cause anything you actually look at that is close to be very blurry.

, At this stage, we are only interested in focusing the eyepiece on the reticle and not on any actual target. Screw the eyepiece in/out until the reticle is in sharp focus. This may take several tries with removing your eye from the eyepiece between tries to give it a rest.

, (This does not have to be more than just snug.)

, Now that we have a clear image of the reticle, the distant target image can be focused on the reticle. In practice, you will think that you are focusing the image on your eye, but what is actually happening is that the image is being focused on the reticle. Most objectives focus by turning the front lens. Some focus by turning a knob on the side of the scope. In any case, the idea is to get a sharp image of the target. It will be easier to focus if you choose a target area with some contrasting texture such as wood grain - you will see the image ""pop"" into focus better on patterns than on large areas.

, This means you have eliminated parallax from your scope system for this target. If the distance to the target changes, you only refocus the front objective (or side focus). You never touch the eyepiece adjustment unless your prescription changes, basically.

"
"
Set up your firing position.,
Set up your target and fire your first few rounds.,
Focus on consistency.,
Adjust your sight to move your shot group.,
Fire another group after each adjustment.",How to Zero a Rifle2," Before firing your first round, make sure you set up a good firing position that allows you to remove as many variables as possible as you fire. In order to zero the weapon, you need to try your best to make everything exactly the same each time you fire, except the adjustments you make the to the sights. If possible, try to set up your firing position on a table, using a shooting rest or something like sandbags or a bipod to stabilize the weapon.If using sandbags, try marking the bag where you rest the weapon. That way you can rest the weapon in the same place on the sandbag each time you fire, even if you move your rifle between rounds.
Try to find a location with limited wind resistance, as wind can dramatically affect the flight path of your rifle.

, Aim for the center of the target and fire one round. Before repositioning or making any adjustments, slowly fire two or even three more. Firing a few rounds will establish a shot group, which can help you determine if you are firing consistently and get a better sense of where the rounds are impacting based on how your sights are currently set up.If all of the rounds impact the target in tight group, that means that you are firing consistently and can adjust the sights to affect where you hit the target.
If the rounds are impacting the target in different areas, it means you are not firing each round in a consistent manner. If the first round hits the top left corner of the target and the second hits the bottom right, it means you are moving the weapon as you fire. Practice good firing fundamentals and keep trying until you can establish a tight group.

, Everything you do before and during firing each round should be exactly the same while zeroing your rifle. Eliminate all variables that you can and interact with the weapon only as much as you have to during the zeroing process. While it’s important to practice firing the weapon the way you intend to use it, zeroing is less about your practice than it is about setting up the weapon effectively.Use the same breathing, sight picture and trigger control each time you fire a round to ensure it isn’t you that affects where the round impacts the target, but the sights.
Doing something differently could result in impacting your target differently. Then the adjustments you make to your sights will be based on your actions instead of the actual zero of the rifle.

, Once you are able to fire a tight shot group at your target, you can begin to adjust your sights to bring that group closer to the center of the target. Different sights use different adjustment methods, and it’s best to familiarize yourself with the instructions that came with your weapon or aftermarket sights to be sure you can adjust each properly. If your rounds impact on the right side of the target, adjust your sights to the left. If they impact high, adjust your sights to lower your aiming point.Scopes or magnified sights usually have two knobs. One adjusts your reticle from right to left (windage) and one adjusts it up and down (elevation). Turn the windage knob to adjust your reticle to move your rounds along the horizontal axis, and the elevation to move them along the vertical axis.
Red dot sights often adjust in a similar manner to scopes, using small knobs to adjust the reticle on the lens from left to right and from up to down.
Iron sights are made up of two components. Adjust the windage by turning the knob on the rear aperture. Elevation is usually adjusted by turning the front sight tip to raise or lower it a small amount on the weapon.

, After you make an adjustment to your sights, fire another slow and controlled group at the target. Ensure you fired another tight shot group, then assess how your changes have affected where the rounds are impacting the target.You may have to repeat this process a number of times as you slowly move your shot groups into the center of the target.
Remember to practice the fundamentals every time you fire to ensure you don’t affect the accuracy of the weapon by changing your methods.

"
"
Find your natural point of aim.,
Practice breath control.,
Use proper trigger control.,
Follow through after firing each round.,
Get good sight picture before firing.",How to Zero a Rifle3," While holding a rifle properly may seem straight forward, it may require a fair amount of practice to do it well. In order to allow yourself to fire accurately and consistently, don’t adopt a comfortable position and then try to point the rifle at the target, instead focus on finding your natural point of aim. You can find your natural point of aim by first determining the most stable position that you can be in to hold your rifle as still as possible. Use bone structure to support the weapon instead of your muscles. While your natural point of aim may not be comfortable, it should be a position you can remain in for a few minutes at a time.You will have a different natural point of aim for each shooting position, but while zeroing your rifle, you should use either the prone (laying down) or a seated position, preferably with a table to support the weapon.
Once you find your natural point of aim, adjust the direction your entire body is pointed instead of just adjusting the weapon. Think of yourself like a life sized green plastic toy soldier. You have to turn the toy to aim downrange, not the weapon.

, When firing your rifle downrange, you need to focus on your breathing to ensure you don’t accidentally affect the flight path of the round by shifting the weapon slightly as you breath. Pay attention to your natural breathing cadence, then fire the weapon during your natural respiratory pause.The natural respiratory pause comes at the end of an exhaled breath. After you exhale, pause for a second before inhaling.
Fire your weapon during that brief pause between exhaling and inhaling.

, Simply pulling a trigger can actually reduce the accuracy of your weapon. Instead of pulling the trigger when you want to fire, slowly squeeze it. When the weapon fires, do not release the trigger right away, but hold it back for a split second instead. Practicing these habits will prevent you from jerking the weapon slightly when pulling the trigger. Zeroing your rifle requires consistency, so squeezing the trigger the same way each time you fire will help you zero it more quickly and accurately.Use a steady and consistent amount of pressure as you squeeze the trigger to avoid jerking the weapon.
Try holding the trigger back for a short one count after you fire each round.

, Follow through coincides with the final portion of trigger control, where you maintain your firing movements for a short time after the round leaves your weapon. Do not pull the trigger and then quickly adjust your positioning. Instead, slowly squeeze the trigger, allow the weapon to fire and remain still with your head in place, looking through your sights and with your finger still in the pull position.Follow through ensures there is no movement in the rifle as you fire the round. Any movement, no matter how slight, can affect the flight path and accuracy of the round.
Take a breath before moving after firing each round.

, Accurately aiming is based entirely on your ability to establish good sight picture, and when using iron sights, establishing front sight alignment. Sight picture is the term used to describe how you see the target through your rifle sights. If you are using sights made up of a front sight tip and rear sight aperture, make sure the front sight tip aligns perfectly with the rear component of your sights. Misalignment means the weapon is not pointed straight at the target. When using red dot or magnification sights, you only need to focus on achieving good sight picture.Proper sight picture involves aligning the sights so you can see the target beyond your sights. Instead of focusing on the target, focus on the front sight tip or reticle on your lens, with the target blurred but visible behind it in your vision.
In all firing situations, establishing good sight picture is the most important element in accurate shooting.

Wait one minute before reloading.",How to Load a Black Powder Revolver," Before loading the revolver, you must remove the manufacturer's preservative and/or any built-up grime. To do so thoroughly, you'll need to disassemble the gun.


The exact disassembly process will vary by manufacturer, so check on the procedure before continuing.;
, Scrub all parts of the disassembled gun with a cotton swab to strip the grease away. Dip the swab in a cleaning solvent or hot, soapy water.


Scrub the interior of all cylinder chambers with the cotton swab.
Set the cylinder down so that all of the chambers face downward. This will allow the water or solvent to drain.
Pass a cleaning patch soaked with solvent or hot, soapy water through the barrel.
Pass clean, dry swabs or patches through each chamber and through the barrel to finish the cleaning process.

, As you reassemble the revolver, you should oil all moving parts and grease the grooves of the cylinder pin.


Note that reassembly will vary by gun manufacturer. As with disassembly, you should check on the exact procedure before continuing.
Use a natural lubricant instead of a petroleum-based one.
Apply a light coating of your chosen lubricant to all moving parts of the gun. Do not oil the gun heavily since doing so can cause fouling.
You should also lightly grease each ball you'll be firing and the opening of each chamber.

, Even if you just reassembled the revolver, it's a good idea to verify that the gun is currently unloaded before continuing.


At this time, you should also put on your safety goggles and hearing protection.

, Set the hammer in its half cocked position. Aim the gun at a safe target and squeeze the trigger.


The hammer should not move. If you can squeeze the trigger and the hammer falls, the revolver is broken and unsafe. Do not load it. Instead, you must have the gun repaired.
The half cocked position acts as the revolver's ""safety"" position.

, Slide a cleaning rod or wooden dowel down the barrel and mark rod at the muzzle. You need to make sure that the chamber is aligned with the barrel.Remove the rod and lay it along the outside of the barrel, lining it up with the mark at the muzzle. The opposite end should end at the nipple, which is where the chamber ends.
Repeat this step with each chamber.
If the rod does not line up correctly for any chamber, there is an obstruction. Do not load it. You must clear the obstruction before continuing.

, If the hammer is not currently half-cocked, then put it into that position now.


Point the gun in a safe direction. Do not point it at yourself or at anyone else. Ideally, you should point it down range.

, Snap a cap on each nipple with the gun still pointed down range.


Note that you may need to pinch the cap to ensure a secure fit.

, Switch the hammer of the gun to its fully cocked position.


At this point, the gun is live. You will be able to pull the trigger and fire it.

, Point the gun at an appropriate target and fire off each cap.


For percussion caps, an appropriate target would be a leaf, blade of grass, or sheet of paper positioned roughly 1 foot (30.5 cm) away. The target should move. If it doesn't, there might be an obstruction in the barrel. Do not load the gun until the obstruction is cleared.
Firing off percussion caps will further clear and dry each chamber.

, Make sure that there are no unfired caps left on any of the nipples before continuing.


You also need to remove any busted or fragmented caps at this time.

, Switch the hammer of the revolver into its half cocked position again.


Note that the cylinder should be able to rotate freely at this point.

, Point the barrel of the gun toward the sky, keeping the entire gun in an upright position.Keep the right side of the gun facing toward you.
Do not position any part of your body over the revolver.

, Carefully pour a properly measured charge of black powder into the chamber closest to the loading cutout. Repeat for each chamber.


Use an individual powder measure. Do not pour powder from a large powder flask or can.
The exact amount of powder will vary depending on the type of gun.

For a .36, use 12 grains of powder. Never exceed 20 grains.
For a .44, use 20 to 28 grains of powder. Never exceed 35 to 40 grains.



, Set a proper size ball or bullet over the opening of the chamber nearest the loading cutout.


The ball should be oversized so that it only rests on top and does not enter.
Make sure that the ball or bullet has been lightly greased before you load it.

, Rotate the cylinder of the revolver until the ball sits under the plunger of the loading lever.

, Unlatch the loading lever and use it to firmly press the ball down until it sits securely and firmly on the powder.


Apply smooth, even pressure as you do this.
There should be no air in between the powder and ball, but you should not crush the powder as you seat the ball.
Also note that a thin outline of lead will be shaved off the ball as you do this. It should be visible at the opening of the chamber. This is a good sign and and indication that the ball is properly fitted.

, Follow the same steps to load the remaining chambers with a ball or bullet.


It is recommended that you only load five chambers of a six-chamber revolver. Keep the hammer rested on the nipple of the unloaded chamber to reduce the risk of an accidental firing.

, Fill the space above the ball in each cylinder with vegetable grease or bullet lubricant.


The use of grease can prevent ""chain firing,"" or accidental secondary discharges.

, Point the gun down range and place a percussion cap on each loaded chamber. With the completion of this step, the revolver is fully loaded.


Make sure that the hammer is still in a half cocked position before doing this.

, Only switch the hammer to a full cock position when you are ready to fire.


If you do not plan to fire the revolver immediately, then you should rest it over the empty chamber of the gun. If no chamber has been left empty, then rest it on a safety notch in between two nipples or on a safety pin.
Note that it is not safe to carry the revolver with the hammer in its half cocked position over a loaded chamber.

, Aim the gun down range at a safe target. Pull the trigger to fire the revolver.


You should be able to continue firing until all of the chambers have been emptied.
Keep count of your shots as you fire. Make sure that all of your shots have fired before you set the gun down or reload it.

, Wait at least one minute before reloading the revolver. Doing so allows any remaining sparks to burn out.


When the revolver is ready to reload, you can reload it by following the same procedure outlined in the ""Loading the Revolver"" section.

Choose a pistol that fits you well, and has the attributes you want in a sidearm.,
Use point-shooting only at very close range, as the best known ""tactically minded"" shooters strongly encourage flash sighting beyond a couple yards.",How to Point Shoot a Pistol (Handgun)1," Determine basic point-shoot capabilities of the gun. With an unloaded gun, close your eyes and point the gun in a safe direction with your finger next to the trigger, but not on it, at a makeshift target. Imagine pointing the barrel of the gun directly at the target. Open your eyes — the sights should be lined up exactly where you wanted it. At five yards, it should be no more than a couple inches off center-target.


If the handgun is pointing high or low, this can be compensated for with practice. For example, almost everyone who has never used a Glock before has a high point-shoot location by 6–10 inches (15.2–25.4 cm) at five yards. But with practice, you will find that you can compensate for that quickly.
If you then pick up a better-fit gun, you will find that it will point low. If the point is too far off, you might want to consider a different handgun.
Side-to-side point-shoot inaccuracy may be a matter of grip or design of the pistol. You may need to try a rubber grip, different back strap, or larger or smaller pistol.;
, But there is no sense in not trying to hone every skill in your bag of tricks.

Clean your rifle scope as necessary.",How to Use a Rifle Scope," Most modern rifle scopes come either pre-drilled and tapped for a scope base or with grooved sections for mounting attachments. It’s important that you purchase mounting hardware that matches the design of your scope. If your scope requires mounting rings, ensure you purchase ones with the correct inside diameter, as the body of the scope will be mounted inside the ring.If you are unsure of the hardware you will need to mount your scope, ask the retailer your purchased the scope from to assist you in choosing the right mounting hardware.
If you purchased your rifle with a factory installed scope you will not need to purchase any hardware.
Gunsmiths can mount and bore sight your scope for you for a fee if you would rather not do it yourself.;
, The reticle of your rifle scope is the image you see on the lens of the scope that indicates where the weapon is pointed. It is usually a cross, though there are many reticle variations that include circles, exes, and a number of others. With the mounting rings loose, rotate the scope until the reticle is right side up or until the cross is properly aligned (like a plus sign). With that done, adjust the distance the lens of the scope will be from your eye to ensure it won’t hit you when the weapon recoils.








As a general rule of thumb, mount the scope an inch further forward than you feel is safe to be certain you won’t injure yourself or damage the scope when firing. You can adjust this distance more later.
Make sure you can easily see the reticle in your normal firing position.

, While there are many rifle scope manufacturers, nearly all of them utilize the same basic components. Before you take your scope out shooting, you should learn what each piece of your scope is called and what it does. A rifle scope is usually comprised of a body, eye piece, objective lens, shoulder, and windage, elevation and parallax knobs.The eyepiece is the part of the scope you look through and the objective lens creates the magnification of the target.
The shoulder of the scope is where the diameter increases to hold the objective lens.
Windage and elevation knobs can move the reticle side to side and up and down. Parallax knobs are rarely adjusted and affect the movement of the reticle in relation to the target.

, A single lens scope provides one level of magnification, whereas a variable power scope has a ring that allows you to choose between different levels of magnification. Most rifle scopes are single powered, but if you’re unsure which your scope is, look for a power selector ring past the shoulder of the scope but before the objective lens. This adjustable ring will permit you to choose between different levels of magnification the scope can provide.








If you have a variable power lens in your scope, choose a setting for the purposes of zeroing the rifle and keep it on that until the scope has been properly zeroed.
When hunting or in tactical situations, keep variable lens scopes set to the lowest magnification power to allow for the widest field of view while using the scope.

, You can determine the strength of your scope by looking at its model number. Scope model numbers include two distinct elements: the level of magnification and the diameter of the objective lens. A scope that is “4 x 30” means that an image will appear to be four times larger through the scope than it would appear to the naked eye. The 30 indicated the number of millimeters the scope’s objective lens is in diameter.Remember that the higher the magnification, the darker your target will appear to be through the lens due to the amount of light that can pass through it. Larger diameter lenses allow more light to enter the scope, thus making the image brighter.
The higher the first number in your scope’s model number, the stronger the level of magnification it provides.
Scopes with variable power will have model numbers like “4-12 x 32,” which means you can adjust between four and twelve times magnification.

, Eye relief is the distance the eye piece is away from your eye. The stronger the magnification of the scope, the narrower the proper eye relief will have to be in order to accurately see your target through the scope. In other words, the more powerful the magnification, the closer you will need to hold your eye to the eye piece in order to capture good sight picture.








Many scopes will come with an eye relief rating that will look like 3-9x. This means proper eye relief is between 3 and 9 inches from the eye piece.
Be extremely careful. Keeping the scope too close to your eye may result in it hitting you due to recoil when firing.
If your scope does not provide an eye relief rating, determine it yourself by looking through the scope while it’s mounted on the rifle and adjusting it until you can achieve good sight picture.

, Without a scope, good sight picture involves aligning the rear sight aperture with the front sight tip on the barrel, but your scope eliminates the need for those types of iron sights. Instead, good sight picture with a scope involves centering the reticle in your field of view, and positioning the reticle over your target. Your view should form a circle at the end of the scope that is perfectly centered. If there is more black on one side or the other, adjust the weapon until it is centered.








Depending on your shooting position, it may be difficult to maintain good sight picture. Placing the weapon on a table or using a bipod can stabilize the weapon and give you an opportunity to achieve proper sight picture.
Capturing good sight picture is more difficult with high magnification scopes than it is with lower ones.

, Be as consistent as possible when firing rounds at the target, and assess where they impact. Fire three to five rounds and look at your grouping. If you are firing consistently, each of the rounds should impact the target in about the same area. If that area is to the left of your intended target, you will need to adjust the windage to the right. If you are impacting the target too high, you can adjust your elevation to lower where the rounds hit the target.








While different manufacturers and models of scopes will have slight variations, the windage knob will always adjust the impact point of your rounds on the horizontal axis (left to right).
Elevation knobs adjust your aiming point on the vertical axis (up and down).
Refer to the manual for your scope to know how far each click of the windage and elevation knobs will alter your aiming point.

, Some high end scopes allow you to adjust a third variable in the scope: the parallax. Parallax is the movement of the target as it relates to the reticle in your field of vision when you move your eye away from the center of the eye piece. An issue with your parallax may cause the target and the reticle to appear to be on different optical planes. For many years, nearly all scopes came with an established and non-adjustable parallax because it is uncommon to need to adjust it and fairly difficult to understand. Under most circumstances, you will not need to adjust the parallax. To adjust the parallax (if you have the necessary knob) try the following:Look at the target through your scope and ensure the reticle is completely visible and clear.
Move your head up, down and to either side as you adjust the parallax knob slightly.
Continue to adjust the knob until the reticle no longer seems to move in relation to the target.

, Once you have gained a solid understanding of how to make adjustments to the aiming point of your rifle scope, you can zero the rifle. Zeroing a rifle involves choosing a set known distance and setting up your scope so that the reticle falls exactly where the rounds impact your intended target. To do so, you must eliminate variables you introduce as the shooter by moving the weapon unintentionally due to things such as heart beats, breathing, and muscle fatigue. Using a bipod or firing table can help you to keep the weapon completely still as you fire rounds to establish a zero. Use the windage knob to move the impact point horizontally and the elevation to adjust it vertically.








Practice proper breath control by breathing in, then out, and firing the weapon in the natural pause between your exhale and the next inhalation.
Utilize good trigger control by squeezing the trigger in a slow steady motion, then holding it in the fire position for a second after firing a round.
Aim at the exact same point with each round, then adjust the scope to bring the reticle and impact points together.

, The lenses on your rifle scope can be easily ruined by scratches or abrasions, so immediately place a lens cover over both the front and back of the scope when it is not in use to avoid damaging the lenses.








Replacement lens covers can be purchased at many fire arms and sporting goods stores.
You can also purchase sleeves to protect the entire scope from damage when not in use.

, Because wiping the lenses of your rifle scope with a non-optical cloth may cause damage to the lens itself, it’s best to utilize a lens brush when cleaning your rifle scope. Lens brushes use extremely soft bristles that are designed specifically not to damage the lenses of your scope while cleaning them. Do not use cloth to wipe the lens unless it is specifically designed for optics and after you’ve already brushed away any sediment stuck to the lens.Wipes that are made to clean eye glasses may be used to wipe away fingerprints or smudges on the lens of your scope.
Lens cleaning fluid can also be used to help remove stuck on smudges.
You can purchase lens brushes at most firearm or sporting goods stores.

, Extreme temperatures can negatively affect the internal lubrication of your rifle scope. Scopes are permanently lubricated and require no maintenance, but because of that you cannot replace lubricant that has been cooked by extreme heat. Direct sunlight can also have a damaging effect on your rifle scope, as the magnification of the objective lens can literally burn the inside of the scope.Store your scope in a vehicle’s trunk, gun cabinet or closet to protect it from heat and direct sunlight.
Avoid storing your rifle scope in the passenger compartment of your vehicle on hot days.

, Almost all rifle scopes are sealed and require no internal maintenance. To clean your scope, simply use a soft dry cloth to wipe away any smudges, fingerprints or sediment that settles on the exterior of the body. Do not submerge your rifle scope in water to clean it or you may damage the seals.Aside from regular optics wipes, you may choose to use anti-fogging optical wipes to clean the lenses of your scope.
Always use a dry cloth when cleaning the body of the scope.
Be careful not to adjust the windage or elevation settings while cleaning the rifle scope.

Know the proper form.A one-handed grip can be difficult and even dangerous if not used correctly.,
Understand the pros and cons of a one-handed grip.,
Try a thumb-over-thumb grip.While the thumb-over-thumb grip is not often used by professional sport shooters, many beginners find it to be the easiest grip technique to master since it provides more stability and makes it easier for the shooter to control the gun during recoil.,
Use the straight thumbs technique.,
Avoid tea-cupping.Tea-cupping, also known as the cup-and-saucer grip, is a somewhat popular two-handed grip technique, but it is also a fairly unstable one.,
Do not cross your thumbs.,
Keep your grip tight.As a general rule, you will shoot better if you grip the pistol with as much strength as possible while still maintaining the ability to control the trigger.,
Set your wrist.,
Apply isometric tension when firing the gun.",How to Grip a Pistol," You automatically have less stability when you only hold the pistol with one hand, but if you distribute the force of your dominant hand as securely as possible, this grip can work.

Hold the pistol with your non-dominant hand.



 


With your dominant hand, form a ""V"" by spreading apart your thumb and index finger. Place the gun into the center of this ""V"" so that the front and rear sights line up evenly with your dominant arm.






Wrap your middle, ring, and pinky fingers around the grip of the pistol. Make sure that you apply equal pressure with all three fingers, and use enough pressure to squeeze the grip of the gun into the back of your hand. Use your thumb to wrap around the other side of the grip, securing it in place.






Use enough pressure to cause your hand to tremble slightly. Relax it just a bit so that the trembling stops. Remember this amount of pressure; it is the proper amount of pressure you will need in order to make this grip style work.






Place your index finger on the trigger. The portion of your finger that lies between the tip and second joint should be the portion on the trigger. You need to make sure that your index finger can pull the trigger without disturbing the other fingers.






Remember the placement of your fingers and the amount of pressure you have applied. This is the right way to use a one-handed grip.





;
, A one-handed grip should be avoided if at all possible since it is a fairly unstable grip style. The primary advantage of this grip is speed. If you need to fire your gun in a hurry, knowing how to do so with one hand might shave a life-saving second off your draw time.

Note that this grip will be much easier to pull off if you are using a pistol with less recoil.






Use a two-handed grip whenever possible. In a two-handed grip, your non-dominant hand gives your dominant hand support and stability as you fire.







, It is slightly less quick and less precise, but you can still have basically good aim while using it.


Place the gun securely into your dominant hand. Spread apart your thumb and index finger. Place the gun into the crook that forms, keeping the gun back strap as high as possible.
Wrap your middle, ring, and pinky fingers around the grip of the pistol. Your middle finger should rest just below the trigger guard.
For the time being, rest your index finger along the opposite side of the gun frame.
Wrap your thumb around the grip. It should touch the top side of your middle finger from the other side.
Notice that there is a gap between the heel of your hand and the tip of your fingers to the left side of the grip. Take your non-dominant or support hand and wrap it around the strong hand so that this gap is no longer visible.
Position the thumb of your non-dominant hand so that it overlaps with the thumb of your dominant hand.
When it comes time to fire the gun, place your index finger on the trigger. The space between the tip of your finger and the top knuckle should be the only part on the trigger.
The most common problem faced with the thumb-over-thumb technique is a tendency to ""muscle"" the pistol, or grip it to tightly. This causes the gun to become unstable during recoil, and if you aren't careful, it may end up twisting in your hands.

, The straight thumbs technique, also called the forward thumbs technique, is very similar to the thumb-over-thumb grip. The only real difference is the placement of your thumbs. This grip tends to be more precise and allows for a faster draw, but it can also be a bit more difficult to master for beginners.


As with the thumb-over-thumb grip, the straight thumbs grip starts with proper placement in your dominant hand. Place the pistol in the crook between your thumb and index finger. Make sure that you keep your hand as high on the grip of the gun as possible.Wrap your middle, ring, and pinky fingers around the grip of the gun so that the fingers are all side-by-side. The middle finger should also lie just below the trigger guard. Keep your index finger on the opposite side of the gun frame.
Wrap your thumb around the grip as you would do with a thumb-over-thumb technique. The tip of the thumb should touch the top side of your middle finger.
There will be a gap between the heel of your hand and the tip of your fingers. Use your non-dominant hand to fill this gap. Wrap it around the dominant hand from the opposite side, positioning the index, middle, ring, and pinky fingers over your dominant fingers.
Line up your non-dominant thumb so that it lines up in front of the dominant thumb. Both thumbs must be pointing forward. Note that your dominant thumb will no longer be touching your dominant middle finger at this point. Instead, it will end up resting on top of the side of your non-dominant thumb.
When you decide to fire your gun, place the top of your index finger on the trigger and pull. You should only pull with the portion of your index finger between the tip and the top knuckle.
Note that there are some pistols that are difficult to shoot with a straight thumbs grip.

With a SIG, the dominant thumb has a tendency to ride up the slide stop and prevent the slide from locking open when empty.
With a Glock, the shooter may find himself or herself pushing up on the slide stop with the heel of the support hand and locking the slide open prematurely.
With a Browning Hi-Power, the dominant thumb can put pressure on the slide stop at the rear and the non-dominant thumb can bang into the front of the slide stop during the recoil, thereby preventing the shell from ejecting.



, It is not advisable to use it. Your non-dominant hand does not provide your dominant hand with enough support, and as a result, your aim is more likely to be skewed and the gun is more likely to fly back during recoil.


With a teacup grip, the dominant hand rests on the gun as it would with any other two-handed grip. The non-dominant hand rests below the dominant hand, essentially ""cupping"" it from the bottom. The non-dominant thumb is usually positioned somewhere around the middle and ring fingers.

, While no experienced shooter crosses his or her thumbs intentionally, a beginner may make this mistake without thinking. When you cross your thumbs, you are putting your thumbs at risk for injury. The slide of the pistol moves back once you fire the gun. When you hold the gun in this manner, you place your thumbs in the path of the slide, causing the slide to crash into the thumbs at full force.


A shooter with crossed thumbs holds both hands around the grip of the gun from either side. The fingers overlap in front of the grip, and the thumbs cross over each other from the back of the grip.

, It is important, though, that you only grip with your hands.


When you grip the pistol, pay attention to what your shoulders and arms are doing. If they feel tense, you need to relax them. Your hands should be the only part of your body in which you feel the tension of the grip.
You may find it easier to keep tension out of your arms if you grip the gun before your arms are in a shooting position. Push your arms out in front only after you have a secure grip on the gun.
A pistol grip that is too relaxed will cause the pistol to recoil too much, but a grip that is too hard may mess with your sight alignment or cause your hands to weaken too quickly.

, Position your wrists so that the heel of your non-dominant hand is as high and flat on the gun as possible. In doing this, you can ultimately support and control the pistol better.


As a general rule, you want both hands to be as high up on the gun as they can be. You need to secure the center of weight or pivot point to prevent the gun from flipping over during its recoil. If you keep your grip too low, you will not be able to steady the gun at this point.

, This technique is also known as the push-pull method. As you apply forward pressure with your dominant or firing hand, you should pull rear pressure using your non-dominant or non-firing hand.


This technique reduces the amount of recoil you will encounter and can improve your aim.
The supporting (non-dominant) arm should be bent with the elbow pulled down. The firing (dominant) arm should be fully extended with the elbow and wrist locked.

Position yourself 3-yards away from a large (10+ inch) target.,
Practice with multiple targets.,
Practice while moving.",How to Point Shoot a Pistol (Handgun)2," In a lowered gun stance (safe-carry position), pull your gun up, as quickly as possible, to firing position and fire multiple shots into the target. Do not use your sights! This drill is to get you less dependent on your sights.


It may take quite a few tries, but you will find you eventually can place that bullet near the center of your target every time.
The key is to try to perform it quickly, but try to take just enough time to allow the momentum of your arms and gun to slow as you get to the target.
Attempt to stretch your abilities by increasing the distance to the target, or decreasing the time you have to fire. Try to get good hits. A slow hit is always better than a fast miss.

, You want to start by setting up three or more targets a yard or two apart. Quick to firing position and go down the line. One shot at each target.


Change it up: fire a burst at each target; maybe try in a different order; have a friend tell you which one to shoot (""one!"", ""three!"", etc.), but the key thing to be sure of is that you hit your target; once you are sure you can hit your target every time, try to accelerate your pace.
Try it from the close contact position at 3- then 5-yards. See how quickly you can change between targets and how many bullets land in ""good hit"" zones.

, While moving, you should still be able to hit targets at 5-yards. Set up three or more targets a few yards apart from each other. Start about 15–18 yards (13.7–16.5 m) back. Run up to about 5-yards (from your first target) while drawing your gun to firing position. Fire a two-shot burst, side-step to engage the next target, and so on.


Each time you run the course, try to do it faster; try not to pause when shooting, but remember that doing so will likely make you much more accurate.
Try drawing when 3- or 5-yards away from the first target. Once you have landed good hits on the first target sidestep and move down the line of targets.

Type-1 malfunction: this is a failure-to-fire (FTF) malfunction.,
Type-2 malfunction: a failure-to-eject is a common problem on older 1911s and other guns with shorter ejectors.,
Type-3 malfunction: this is known as ""the Mother Of All Malfunctions"" (MOAM) by some.,
Type-4 malfunction: this is pretty uncommon, and if it ever happens to you when you are practicing with your gun at the range, throw the gun away and get a different model!",How to Get Better Using Your Pistol (Handgun)1," You pull the trigger and you get a ""click"" instead of a ""boom."" This is the simplest type of malfunction, the most common type, and the easiest to fix: just tap, rack/flip.;
, This type of malfunction is affectionately known as a ""stovepipe.""


The symptom of this malfunction is a ""dead trigger"" (no click, just a little bit of movement), and most likely some brass sticking out of your ejection port (but not necessarily), and the slide is not completely in battery (all the way forward). Fix it using the same method at a Type-1 malfunction: tap, rack/flip.

, This is a feed-way stoppage, which means that too much brass is in the chamber at the same time.


If you do get a type-3 malfunction under fire, many pistol masters will tell you just to grab for your back-up. Of course, if that is not an option you should find cover before executing the clearing.
To clear: grab your slide and lock it back (this is optional on many handguns). Press the magazine eject, grab the magazine and throw it to the ground (""strip"" it). Grab the slide again and rack it hard three times. Reach for a fresh magazine, put it in the gun (same as the tactical reload) and rack the slide one more time to load a round into the chamber. You can also learn to keep the magazine you have in your gun, read this.

, This malfunction is when the slide does not go back into battery after firing.


This might happen because your guide rod or guide rails are really gummed up (to the point where it looks as if there is a wad of Juicy Fruit in there), your guide spring is too weak or your chamber design is bad. Either way, modern semi-automatic pistols should never have this happen. A gunsmith (or you) may be able to diagnose the problem and fix it, but a gun that gets a Type-4 is not a reliable gun!(edit* The gun can be perfectly reliable and still have a type 4 malfunction. A good cleaning may fix the problem or you recoil spring is weakened and needs to be replaced, Or as stated take the firearm to a gunsmith)

While point-shooting sounds like a great idea (to be able to naturally point at a target), it is (for 99% of people) a very bad idea.,
The other option is called ""flash sighting"".,
Studies in police departments which train with flash sighting against departments who teach point-shooting have shown staggering results.,
Most people can use that one-tenth of a second to get that guaranteed hit instead of just putting a bunch of holes in the walls behind the bad guy.,
Ultimately the ""point of the gun"" (mentioned in choosing a good sidearm) is still important as it will decrease the amount of time required to flash sight, but since you are still using the sights it is less important.

,
Alternatively, most real life threat armed encounters occur at less than 21 feet (6.4 m), and the accepted hit rate in the shooting community is < 20%.",How to Get Better Using Your Pistol (Handgun)2," Past three or four yards, it may be impossible to get reliable hits on center-mass of a target. And remember, they say: think of the worst day at the range, you will be twice as bad as that in the middle of a gun fight!

, This means you pull the gun up to the standard shooting position; focus hard on the front of your gun and when the front post (sight) is somewhere in between the rear sights, you fire! It doesn't matter where; at three to seven yards even the worst flash sighting gets center-mass hits.

, The flash sighting police hit their targets four times as much as those who point-shoot. Average first shot times were less than one-tenth of a second slower (for those who flash sight).

, Flash sighting is something that needs to be rigorously trained, else you might return to point-shooting.

,, And since most PD's have and still train in the use of sighted fire, it obviously fails or is not available for use due to the BAR and it's affect on vision and fine motor skill coordination. Thus a knowledge of and practice in Point Shooting can provide the insurance and assurance that one will be able to make hits at close quarter ranges. And it is not a bar from using sighted shooting methods if conditions allow them to be employed.

Position 1: Pull your support hand in close to your body (touching your stomach is a great place).,
Position 2: Pull the pistol straight up (for passive-retention holsters, a straight, firm jerk is required), a couple inches from the holster.

,
Position 3: Rotate your wrist and lower your elbow of your firing arm.,
Position 4: Move your gun forward straight toward the target (sights level).,
Position 5: Complete the motion, extend firing arm to a good firing position.,
Once in the firing position you should be pulling back with your support and while pushing forward with your firing hand.,
Re-holstering should be done in the exact opposite order.,
Once you have practiced (perfectly, start slow!)",How to Get Better Using Your Pistol (Handgun)3," Your firing hand moves up above your pistol grip and back down on it to get a good firing grip on the gun (while in the holster). Release any retention system you may have.

,, This gets the pistol pointed down range at your target. Disengage any safety you have. From this position you are able to shoot a very close target (if necessary).

, When the gun passes your stomach, move your support hand toward the gun and in front of your firing hand to get a good firing grip on it.

, Keep your support elbow low (straight down is best).

, This creates ""isometric pressure"" which controls the muzzle flip and felt recoil of the gun.

, Pull back to close contact position 3, place your hand on your stomach, safety on, rotate your wrist and raise your elbow, push gun straight down into holster and secure. As mentioned before, a tactical reload before you re-holster is an excellent choice and habit to get into (read this to find out how to do a tactical reload).

, drawing about 500 to 1000 times (no joke — that is about how long it takes for the process to become procedural muscle memory) you will find you can draw extremely fast. Start practicing drawing and shooting a target (if possible).

Prone: You need to practice lying on the ground.,

Cover and Concealment: Hiding behind cover in a gun fight seems like a smart idea, but don't think you are invincible behind most materials.",How to Get Better Using Your Pistol (Handgun)4," You will find that lining up your sights will be quite different and rapid fire become difficult to control. Your stance on the ground should be such: lay on your belly. Then roll slightly to the firing side. Place your support knee and elbow down on the ground. You will be a bit sideways, but your firing arm will be completely flush with the ground with your head resting on it looking down the sights. This allows burden-free breathing and a very stable platform.

, Put your firing leg behind you and essentially sit down on the heel of your foot. Your firing knee will be on the ground and your toe. Rest your support elbow on your support knee. You are in a tripod position (support foot, firing toe and firing knee), and you are in an arrangement where you can move quickly (practice moving periodically to and from the crouching position).

, There is a big difference between ""cover"" and ""concealment"". Objects like car doors and walls may only serve to keep you hidden from your opponents' view (concealment), but in most cases bullets can pierce through these objects. It is more advisable to look for something that can stop bullets as well as hide your whereabouts (cover). Shooting from behind cover should be done while exposing as little of your body as possible. If the cover allows it, do not expose your body from the same side.

Position yourself about 7-yards (the distance the FBI determined a man could move in a second and a half; about the time it takes to draw a pistol and fire) away from a large (10+ inch) target.,
The next stage is to put bursts into the target.,
Practice with multiple targets.,
Practice while moving.,
Integrate the Mozambique Drill.",How to Flash Sight a Pistol (Handgun)1,"


In a lowered gun stance (ready position), pull your gun up, as quickly as possible, to firing position and focus hard on the front sight of your gun, wait until you see a bit of the front sight between the rear sights and pull the trigger (this is the primary drill to help your get in the habit of flash sighting).
You should be able to land a hit in the 10-inch target every time. If you are missing try going a little slower. The key is to practice perfectly, and the speed will come naturally.;
, Take a few steps back (go for 10 yards). Do the same things as before, but this time, put two or three shots quickly into your target. Between each shot, get the flash sight again. Once you are able to get to firing position and put three quick shots into your 10+ inch target consistently in under a second-and-a-half, you can move on.

, You want to start by setting up three or more targets a yard or two apart. Quick to firing position and go down the line. One shot at each target.


Change it up: maybe try it in a different order; have a friend tell you which one to shoot (""one!"", ""three!"", etc.), but the key thing to be sure of is that you hit your target; once you are sure you can hit your target every time, try to accelerate your pace.
At first when you fire move the gun with the recoil. As soon as the recoil is completed you should be on the next target already. As you get faster you can force the gun into position and be ready before the recoil is complete.

, While moving, you should still be able to hit targets at 7-yards. Set up three or more targets about a few yards apart from each other. Start about 15–18 yards (13.7–16.5 m) back. Run up to about 10 yards (from your first target) while drawing your gun to firing position. Fire a two-shot burst, side-step to engage the next target, and so on.


Each time you run the course, try to do it faster; try to pause as little as possible when shooting (even while moving you should be able to get a flash sight), the longer you pause the more accurate you will be, but in a gun fight, the clock is always ticking quicker than at the range.

, If a friend is calling out target numbers, and they call the number of a target you have already shot, this time you go for a head shot. This is also known as ""failure to stop"" practice.


The idea is, you have shot the target, but he isn't impressed (i.e. he is on drugs, is wearing body armor, or is just plain determined) and keeps coming, so you have to take a head shot. Read Human Targets for more information.

"
These are the basics.",How to Flash Sight a Pistol (Handgun)2,"


While point-shooting sounds like a great idea (to be able to naturally point at a target), it is (for 99% of people) a very bad idea at less than touching distances. Past three or four yards, it may be impossible to get reliable hits on center-mass of a target. And remember, they say: think of the worst day at the range, you will be twice as bad as that in the middle of a gun fight!
The other option is called ""flash sighting"". This means you pull the gun up to the standard shooting position; focus hard on the front of your gun and when the front post (sight) is somewhere in between the rear sights, you fire! It doesn't matter where; at three to seven yards even the worst flash sighting gets center-mass hits.
Studies in police departments which train with flash sighting against departments who teach point-shooting have shown staggering results. The flash sighting police hit their targets four times as much as those who point-shoot. Average first shot times were less than one-tenth of a second slower (for those who flash sight).
Most people can use that one-tenth of a second to get that guaranteed hit instead of just putting a bunch of holes in the walls behind the bad guy. Flash sighting is something that needs to be rigorously trained, else you might return to point-shooting.
Ultimately the ""point of the gun"" (mentioned in choosing a good sidearm) is still important as it will decrease the amount of time required to flash sight, but since you are still using the sights it is less important.
The above info may be OK for shooting on the range, but that does not mean it will work in a real close quarters life threat situation.
That should not come as a surprise to many as Bill Lewinski of the Force Science Institute had the following info about the eye in his 2002 Police Marksman article titled: Stress Reactions Related To Lethal Force Encounters: ""The eye undergoes three changes under high stress. The pupils dilate, the lens flattens and the eyes begin to move in a ""saccadic"" fashion....""
The thinning of the lens causes the loss of near vision and the ability to focus on the sights, so Sight Shooting won't be able to be used. And with the result that one will have no effective shooting method to use in their self defense in those situations where there is the greatest chance of being shot and killed. That is, unless they are taught an alternate shooting method such as P&S.
Sight Shooting has been taught for over 100 years, yet there are no pics or videos of it ever having been used effectively in a close quarters armed encounter.
P&S is an effective method of instinctive, fast, and accurate aiming at close quarters distances, and it can be learned with little or no training, and maintained with little or no practice. Common sense and safe gun handling apply to its use.
Basically, the index finger is placed along the side of the gun, pointed at the target, and the trigger is pulled with the middle finger.

Some dealers may require additional information as well. If you are concerned, you can call ahead and check with the dealer.If you are trying to find out the application procedure, you can call a dealership that interests you and ask, “Hello, will you please tell me what information I will need to bring so I can apply to buy a handgun? I do not already have a license to carry or to purchase.”
The dealer is allowed to charge an administrative fee for the background check.

, The dealer must take your identifying information and proceed with a federal background check through several sources. The dealer will notify the FBI, which then checks three sources, the National Crime Information Center, the Interstate Identification Index, and the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) Index. These each contain different state and federal criminal records. The FBI will notify the dealer within three days if there is any reason not to accept your application and sell you the gun.If the dealer does not receive a negative report on your application within three days, then your sale may proceed.

Alternatively, you could consult with an attorney for a legal interpretation., Minnesota has two age requirements for obtaining either a permit to carry or a license to purchase a handgun. You must be at least 21 to purchase and carry a handgun or handgun ammunition from a licensed dealer. You must be at least 18 to purchase a semi-automatic assault rifle., To get either a permit to carry a handgun or a permit to purchase or transfer a handgun, you must have a clean criminal record. In some cases, if you have been convicted of a disqualifying crime, you may still be able to obtain a permit if, after your conviction, you obtain a pardon or go through some other legal process to have your legal rights reestablished. Specific crime-related limitations are as follows:You must not have been convicted of a “crime of violence” in Minnesota or elsewhere, unless you have undergone a legal process to have your civil rights restored.

,, Make sure you are equally good at shooting accurately with both your left and right hand.

,, No matter what you've seen in John Woo movies, the human eye can't accurately aim two pistols at once, so use point shooting. This will lower your accuracy, but the alternative is painfully slow shooting.

, If you fire both pistols in different directions, check in advance that there's nothing that would be dangerous or irresponsible to shoot in the direction you aren't looking. And naturally, shooting in a direction without looking will be very bad for that hand's accuracy.

Both hands should perform their maneuvers simultaneously.,
Your wrist should be as straight as possible.,
Remembering to keep your wrist straight or in line with your forearm, rotate your arm at the shoulder down and forward.,
Remembering to keep the gun pointed towards the threat, move your gun toward your support hand at the upper chest and stop the gun underneath your dominant/shooting eye.,
Complete the motion, keep your shoulders squared to the threat (face the threat), extend both arm straight out.,
Create ""isometric pressure"" once in the firing position.,
Performing a tactical reload before you re-holster (only after the fight seems to be done) is an excellent tactical choice and habit to get into.,
Re-holster in the exact opposite order of above.,
Practice (perfectly, start slow!),
Try drawing and shooting a target at the range once you have the presentation perfected.",How to Do a Tactical Quickdraw With a Pistol," Pull your support hand to your body (touching your upper chest is a great place). Your firing hand moves up above your pistol grip and back down on it to get a good firing grip on the gun (while in the holster). A good firing grip consist of the hand being high on the grip. The web of your hand between your thumb and index finger should be as high as possible into the tang of the pistol. Your index (pointing) finger should be straight and resting on the side of the holster (see photo). Never put your finger on the trigger before drawing, as this is how negligent discharges happen. Release any active-retention system you may have.


This is one of the most important steps to complete the presentation quickly. You should practice bursting (all of a sudden) into this position.






If you get a poor grip the gun now, it will be hard to adjust as you draw the weapon, and will cause your shots to be inaccurate.
This position is easy to practice many times (and should be practiced the most) as it is a short and quick motion. Be sure to emphasize a perfect firing grip on the gun (all fingers around the grip —stock— and trigger finger on the index point).;
, It should not be canted either left, right, forward or backwards. Pull the pistol straight up remembering to keep your wrist in the straight position. If more elevation of the pistol is needed to clear the holster, rotating your arm at the shoulder in an upwards and backwards motion should clear the pistol of the holster. (for passive-retention holsters, a straight, firm jerk is required)


The pistol should be clear of any obstructions (to the front) created by the holster, but depending on the holster it may still be very near the holster (for example, the holster in the image has an open front so lifting above the holster is not required, just lift it to the opening).







, This gets the pistol pointed down range at your target. If your pistol has an external safety, you should disengage it simultaneously as you are rotating you arm forward.


From this position you are able to shoot a very close target (if necessary). Do not consider shooting from this position if the target is further than five feet (an arm-and-a-half away). For these reasons, this position is called ""close-contact firing position"" or ""firing from retention"".






This is not a position that most gun ranges would likely enjoy you shooting from, so you may have to just dry-practice this position, or at a less-official range (see Tips).
The key when practicing moving from position two to position three is to keep your wrist straight/in line with your forearm and rotating at the shoulder.







, While you are moving the gun, your support hand should be preparing to receive the gun. It should also move and meet the gun underneath the dominant eye. The support hand should wrap around the front of the grip and the side, enclosing the entire grip.


You want to keep the muzzle level (parallel to the ground — for dry-practice — or pointed at your target) this way as you look at your target and your gun comes into view you can start to line up your sights in the split seconds as the gun moves.
Having a friend watch your during your transition from position three to position five is very handy. The friend can tell you if you are ""bowling"" (dipping your muzzle low) or arching (throwing your muzzle high). Either one of those is less efficient and does not allow you to light up your sights on the fly.







, Bending of one of the arms is not recommended. Putting pressure on the gun and bending one arm causes a natural tendency for your body to twist causing your shots to be off. It can be overcome over time but is not recommended.


At the range a very straight firing arm is a good way to keep your sights at tight as possible, but in a tactical situation it usually is not best to keep fully extended because you increase your visual size.






Practice just extending it about two-thirds of the way, or even half. It will take some getting used to as the gun is much closer to your face than you are used to, but the smaller profile is much better for close quarters tactics.






Just before the gun is to its final position you should quickly focus directly, and only, on your front sight. Sight alignment should come shortly after (for more information on sight alignment, sight picture, and flash sighting please read the Tactically Prepare Yourself With a Pistol article.







, This is a stabilizing pressure that helps immensely for follow up shots, primarily, but helps retention and other things as well. Isometric pressure is made by pulling back with your support hand while pushing forward with your firing hand.


This is a strenuous position, but highly beneficial. Practicing this every time you are at the range will help your shooting, and will give yourself procedural memory that will be used in any extreme situation. This pressure which is being created should be somewhat tiring the first few times you try it. Especially when your firing arm is not fully extended.
The firing hand grip can be loosened (for increased accuracy) while more pressure is built-up by the support arm.

,


Not only are you sure you have encountered a lull in the fight (as nothing is immediately a threat), but if something were to happen while you are re-holstering, or after you have holstered, you have a full magazine (+1 in the chamber) to retaliate against an aftershock which may occur.

, Pull back to close contact position 3, place your hand on your stomach.


At this point it may behoove you to pause. In a combat situation, the fight which you think is done may spring up again. Take one last quick look around.
Then safety on, rotate your wrist and raise your elbow, push gun straight down into holster and secure. Unless you are a law enforcement officer, there should be no rush to re-holster your weapon, so these last two steps you can take slowly and make sure your pistol slides in your holster smoothly.






Be sure to maintain a full firing-grip on your pistol until you have completely secured the pistol in the holster (again, this allows for a quick response to any surprises which may arise).







, drawing about 500 to 1000 times (no joke — that is about how long it takes for the process to become procedural muscle memory) and soon you will find you can draw extremely fast.


Dry-practice (with an unloaded gun — see Warnings below) is the best way to get the motions ingrained into your muscle memory without any additional cost. Practicing for about 20 minutes everyday for a week will surprise you how fast you can become.

, Remember steps three through five should be smooth and level, try focusing on your front sight sooner until you are able to be flash sighted before your gun is in its final position. This is how you become a quick shot from the holster.

Mount the scope.,
Gather the following materials:

Padding of some kind so you don't go home aching and sore and also to protect the finish of your rifle.,
Bore sight your rifle.,
Sight to 25 yards (22.9 m).,
Cease firing.,
Sight to 100 yards (91.4 m).",How to Sight the Scope of a Rifle in and Zero It," Get your rifle and mount the scope with mounts that are designed to take as much recoil as your rifle will produce.


This is very important because if you are shooting a 30-06 and you have a .22 scope mounted on it, very bad things will happen! For example, your scope will probably fly off your rifle and could injure you or those around you.
Make sure the mounts are tight, and if necessary, use lock-tite on the screws.
;
,
A rifle rest or sandbags for added stability and to reduce error.
Start with at least a hundred rounds of ammunition
A bore sighter. They cost around $20-$50 and help the sighting process go much smoother.
Screwdrivers for adjusting your scope
Targets
A pair of binoculars
Note: if you are going to be using a tripod on your rifle, put this on with your scope.

,


At the range, set your target at 25 yards/meters and 100 yards/meters.
Secure the rifle in a bipod, on sandbags, or just any other method to hold the rifle steady while you sight it. Make sure no part of the rifle is resting on a hard surface.
If you have a bolt-action rifle, remove the bolt and look down the bore, aligning the bore with the target.
If you have a single-shot rifle, open the action.
Note: auto-loader rifles and pumps cannot be bore sighted this way.
Adjust the rifle stand so that when looking through the breech end, the 100-yard target is centered in your view.
Without moving the rifle, adjust your scope so that the cross-hairs are aligned on the same object.
Your rifle is now bore-sighted to 100 yards (91.4 m).

, When you're done bore sighting, replace the bolt, and set your scope to the highest magnification that gives you a clear image.


Relax, and fire one round at the center of of the 25-yard target.


, Make sure your rifle is unloaded, and look towards your target with binoculars or a spotting scope.


Find the shot grouping and see what you need to do when you adjust.
For example, if your bullet hit in the bottom left corner, you would adjust your scope up and to the right. Follow the scope manufacturer's instructions on sighting.
Repeat this process until your shots are hitting in the center.

, Make sure your barrel has cooled, get into comfortable, relaxed position, and fire 3 shots, slowly and carefully.


Check the shot grouping, and adjust the sight so that when aimed at the center of the bullseye, the bullets hit about 3 inches (7.6 cm) above center. This will give you the most effective maximum range.

"
Check that the gun is unloaded.,
Clean the rifle thoroughly, including the barrel.,
Tighten any loose screws on the sights and scope mounts.",How to Sight In a Rifle1," Always double-check to make sure that the gun is not loaded before starting to clean the rifle. Always practice good firearm safety and handling measures.;
, Rifles that have been sitting in storage for a long time, or rifles that are frequently used for hunting, can become covered with dust and grime. A clean rifle will shoot more accurately than a dirty one.


There is no set time when your gun should be cleaned, but the general consensus is to clean it after you are done firing for the day, and before and after you put the gun in storage., Like dirty rifles, loose screws can cause a rifle to fire inaccurately.

"
"
Decide between a dedicated rest or sandbags.,
Determine where you want to set the rest up.,
Place the rifle securely in the rest.",How to Sight In a Rifle2," The decision comes down to your budget and what you’re comfortable working with. There are professionally made rests available for purchase that will secure your rifle, or you can use sandbags to create a firm rest.


It is essential that the rifle does not move during the sighting process. Whichever rest method you use is fine as long as there is no movement.
Depending on the rest you use, you may need to prop the front or the rear of the rifle with sandbags.

, Depending on the location that you’re shooting, you may have access to different options. Comfort is not especially necessary since you won’t be firing much from this position.


If you are using a firing range, you may be able to use a bench at the facility.
If you are shooting in the wild, you can either set a bench or table up yourself, or assemble the rest on the hood of a car.
If you are prepared to lie down, you can set your rest up on the ground, provided that there is enough clearance to safely shoot.

, If you are using a gun vise as a rest, make sure that it is fastened securely. Wedge the butt securely into sandbags and rest the stock on another. Make sure that the rifle is as stable and secure as possible.


The only thing moving should be the trigger when you squeeze it.

Set up a target with a bull’s-eye at 25 yards (22.9 m).,
Remove the bolt from the rifle.,
Look through the barrel at the bull’s-eye.,
Adjust the scope.,
Reinsert the bolt.",How to Sight In a Rifle3," This technique alone will not accurately sight-in a rifle, but it may help get your rifle shooting much closer to the intended target than before.Most rifle sighting is done first at 25 yards (22.9 m), then at 100 yards (91.4 m). This will give you a more accurate sighting over long distances.
A quick way to measure yardage is to grab a tape measure and see how many paces it take you to travel 30 feet (9.1 m). Do this a couple times and average the results. Once you know how many paces 30 feet (10 yards) is, you can measure out 25 yards (22.9 m).

, The process for this varies from firearm to firearm, but almost all bolt-action hunting rifles should be able to do this relatively easily.


Make sure to place the bolt somewhere clean while bore-sighting.

, Move the rifle until the middle of the bull’s-eye is lined up with the barrel. If you are not using a bolt-action rifle, you can insert a collimator, which is a bore-sighting instrument, into the end of the barrel to continue bore-sighting the rifle.


Make absolutely sure to remove the collimator before firing your rifle.

, Check the scope to see if the crosshairs are also lined up with the bull’s-eye. If they are not, adjust the settings on the scope in the opposite direction you want the scope to move, until the crosshairs go through the center of the bull’s-eye. In other words, if you want the crosshairs to move up, you will have to turn the scope adjustment knob in the downward direction.

, Once you have finished bore-sighting the rifle, return the bolt to its original position.

"
"
Find the target in the scope.,
Check your rest again.,
Load the rifle with the ammunition you intend to shoot with.,
Fire your first shots.,
Find the center of the group.,
Shoot again.,
Place the target at 100 yards (91.4 m).",How to Sight In a Rifle4," Your target should still be 25 yards (22.9 m) out. Place the crosshairs directly on the center of the bull’s-eye. It shouldn’t require much adjustment from the bore-sighting section.

, Once you have the rifle aimed at the target, double-check your gun rest to make sure that it is secure and that the gun will not move when fired. Place extra sandbags around the butt if necessary.

, Different bullets have different weights, so it may shoot inaccurately if you change ammunition after sighting-in the rifle. When you are sighting in a rifle, you are essentially sighting it for one specific type of ammunition.


Put the cartridge in gently, so that you don’t disrupt the positioning of the rifle.

, Fire a group of 3 shots at the bull’s-eye, taking care to stay in the same position for each shot.Try to fire when there is little to no wind, so that your shot will not be affected.


Always follow strict safety guidelines when handling a live firearm. Never shoot when someone is downrange, and never point a loaded gun at another person.

, Measure how far away the center spot is from the bull’s-eye. Adjust the crosshairs vertically and horizontally, using the scope adjustment knobs. For example, if you need to move up 3 inches (7.6 cm), you would turn the scope adjustment knob in the up direction.

, Continue the 3-shot process, adjusting the scope as necessary, until you have centered the shots on the target.


Allow your gun to cool between shooting groups of shots. You should be able to hold the barrel for 10 seconds without burning yourself before firing again. If the barrel gets too hot, it can warp and lead to misfires and bad accuracy., Repeat the 3-shot process until you have centered the shots on the target again. Once you’ve centered your shots, you have successfully sighted-in the rifle.

Point the gun away from you and anyone in range - the safe direction is almost always at the target(s).,
Open the breech by opening the bolt.,
If there is a round in the breech, remove it.,

, Move the lever or bolt handle upwards, then pull the bolt back as far as you can. (Do not force it, it should come easily)

, Check to see if it has been misfired (it will be indented if so) - if it is a misfire, dispose of it. If you don't know where it came from, dispose of it. Otherwise, fire it at your own risk.

, You will have to click it into place. Some rifles require manual loading by placing the round behind the breech and SLIDING the round forward into it, until it is secure. Some rifles also have a built in magazine, that requires either a stripper clip or manual loading of each round. These rifles typically take 5-10 rounds. To load bullets manually in these rifles, push bullets down into magazine, they fit with the follower plate. Don't try to fit an extra round in the breech, just fill the magazine to it's capacity.

, The bolt head strips a bullet from the magazine and the rifle is now ready to fire.

The rifle must, in all respects, fit the needs of the marksman.,
For target practice (AKA ""plinking"") Always use a .308.,
For competitive target shooting, match-grade ammunition is preferred.,
For small varmint shooting (smaller than coyote – such as squirrels, rabbits, birds, etc), favor the .22lr.,
For large varmint shooting (sizes such as coyotes or even small boar) a .223 round is likely the smallest round you would want to use.,
For wild game (boar, deer, etc) a 6mm to a .30 caliber round will be sufficient to put a good portion of traditional game down quickly(deer, elk, bear, moose and almost anything else).,
Though we will be dealing more with targets and animals, if a situation arises which a human must be shot, a .223 round to a vital area is plenty, but a .308 or other .30 caliber round is arguably a better bullet as it will cause more damage if vitals are missed and will impact a human wearing heavy clothing more than the much lighter .223 round.

,
Weight of the bullet is something to consider, but in most situations it matters less than bullet design.,
Assume ALL firearms are loaded and ready to fire until you personally see that there is no ammo in the chamber.,
Be aware of your surroundings, specifically in the direction you are shooting.,
Point your rifle ONLY at something that you intend to shoot.,
Keep your finger off the trigger and the safety enabled until you intend to pull the trigger.

,
Ensure that your firearms and ammo are secure from anyone when stored in your home.

,
Be sure you have read and understand How to Handle a Firearm Safely.,
Pick the right location (keeping safety in mind).,
Bench rest: This is the most accurate stance.,
Prone: By far, this is the most accurate field position for ""sniping"".,
Crouching/Kneeling: This stance is considerably less accurate than a prone position.,
Standing: This is not a recommended stance, as it is very inaccurate compared to either of the other stances.,
Choose your rifle position.,
The forearm under the stock (if prone) or under the front of the gun where there is obviously a grip.,
Become aware of your breathing.,
Consider trigger pull.,
Scopes assist riflemen by allowing them to see more precisely at further distances.",How to Snipe or Be a Marksman With a Rifle," Choosing a rifle of insufficient quality or too expensive to shoot may greatly reduce your ability in the field.


Consider the brand of the rifle. Most brand names are good buys, but, in the current active gun-buying market, can often be overpriced. Shop around, as prices at local dealer and on-line auction prices can vary considerably.
As a rule of thumb, bolt-action rifles are usually more accurate and have a slightly higher muzzle velocity than an equivalent (price and quality) semi-automatic (auto-loading) rifle. The current crop of AR15 variants have achieved much higher accuracy, and are often advertised as capable of sub-MOA (Minute Of Angle) accuracy. This means they can group shots within one ""minute"" of angle (roughly 1"" at 100 yards) which is competitive with the better bolt guns.
Faster rifle twist ratios allow for heavier bullets to be shot more accurately through the rifle. For example, a .223 barrel with a twist ratio of 1:12 may only be able to shoot a 40-52 grain bullet accurately, while a barrel with a twist ratio of 1:9 will be able to shoot, accurately, any bullet between 40 and 65 grains, it will also compensate (to a point) the .223's tendency to tumble after penetrating a target.

There are drawbacks to higher twist ratios though, muzzle velocity may be reduced by a percent or two, there can be extra wear and tear on the barrel, and over-stabilization of the bullet can result in less damage to the target (these are minor drawbacks, however).

;
, Stick to rifle-style rounds (easily identifiable by a necked-down casing, unlike the .22 where the case is the same diameter from end to end). These rounds have a much higher powder to bullet weight ratio, which results in higher muzzle velocities. Of course, if the cost of doing so is too high, .22lr practice will at least get you trigger time with plenty of economy.

, It is more consistent and uses higher quality bullets; for plinking, cheap ammunition selection is fine.

, Low report (noise) and low recoil make it less likely to startle your prey if you miss, and quicker on follow up shots. Some of the more powerful .224 caliber rounds work quite well and will extend your range well past that of the .22lr.

, Though it is possible to kill this size of animal with smaller rounds, it becomes essential to get a head or heart shot; else the animal may die a slow painful death, or not die at all. Though for smaller animals a round as large as a .308 will be approaching the range of overkill, something in between these sizes is recommended.

, Even a .223 could kill these animals, but with smaller rounds, the bullet precision is much more important. If using smaller diameter rounds for large game, heavier bullets will transfer energy more quickly into the target.


Larger calibers such as the .338 Winchester Magnum or 45-70 and larger are helpful for use against very large wild game such as buffalo, or dangerous game abroad. However many people will suggest that accuracy is more important for hunting than caliber size, for instance some guides would have a client use a .270 for animals like bear and moose if they can shoot it accurately over a higher powered cartridge like the .300 Winchester Magnum.

,, Bullet weight is expressed in GRAINS, a common measure of gunpowder and bullet weight.


Light bullets are often favored for varmint and target shooting. The higher velocity allows a flat trajectory within a couple hundred yards of the muzzle. The bullet reaches the target quicker, so less leading is required as well.
Heavier bullets are preferred for game shooting. On contact with target, it delivers more energy in a shorter amount of time (which is more lethal). It may also reduce the likelihood of over-penetration. Over longer distances, due to ballistic coefficients (how streamlined the bullet is as it flies through the air), heavier bullets can produce flatter trajectories than light bullets, and are ultimately less affected by crosswind.
An example for a .223 (each caliber and rifle will behave differently): a 42 grain bullet (3700 FPS) at 100 yards (91.4 m) will drop (with no sight-zero) about an inch and a half. At 500 yards (457.2 m), it will drop probably around four feet and maintains about 80% of its velocity. A 65 grain bullet (3000FPS) at 100 yards (91.4 m) will drop two inches, but at 500 yards (457.2 m) will only drop three feet. At 500 yards (457.2 m) the bullet maintains about 85% of its velocity.
As a point of interest, if a bullet is dropped from your hand at exactly the same time as the same weight bullet leaves the muzzle of the rifle (fired horizontally to ground), BOTH bullets will hit the ground at the same time. Gravity has the same effect on a bullet that is stationary as it does on a bullet that is flying through the air.

, Insert a yellow plastic ""empty chamber indicator"" when handling guns.

, High velocity rifle rounds are capable of traveling miles. Most bullets can easily penetrate drywall in a home.

, Otherwise, keep the muzzle pointed in a safe direction (at the ground).

,,, All the rules should be followed at all times.

, You want to be able to position yourself comfortably. When shooting paper targets (and the like), comfort is your number one goal. You want to be able to practice at your optimal performance. When shooting animals, you want to be invisible to them. Even squirrels have a very keen sense of predators (that's you). If they see you, they'll likely run, and it may take several minutes before they brave the open land again.


With animals, height advantage is good. It allows you to see more area. But be sure to conceal most of your body in a thicket, tall brush, or by crawling.
With larger game, studying their patterns and location over multiple trips to the same area can be very useful; if you know a deer's escape route is past a long straight path, force them to run their escape, post on the path, and wait for them to cross.

, Although, this is less of a stance and more of a location of your rifle. This allows your rifle to rest on something other than you or the ground.


It gives the most stable platform without human input. This allows you to sight in your sights or scope, so you know when you are holding the gun that it is your fault when you miss. If you are planning on hunting you should get better at the below stances because you are probably not going to take a bench with you on your hunt.

, The most common position is lying on your belly with your legs spread out, your feet arch down partly embedded in the ground and the rifle tight in your shoulder. The position will look like you are in a "" Y "" shape. This position is the most stable prone position as to have the recoil be absorbed through your body. This will cut the recoil enough to give you better accuracy at longer ranges. Also as a note, your breathing has the most effect on your shot.


With a bipod or some other way to hold the front of the gun, it is often best to put your support (non-trigger) hand under the butt of the stock. This allows you to position the elevation of the sights or scope more precisely.
If there is no bipod or other item to hold the front of the gun, your support hand should hold the front of the gun, this is less accurate than a bipod so invest in a good quality leather military style sling. Use a ""loop sling"" position. This is made by having the sling connected to the front swivel and the other end in a loop to go as high up on your bicep as possible. Then put your arm through the area between the rifle and sling. Then in a clockwise motion end up with the forward hand gripping the rifle under the front stock close to the swivel.
You also have the option of making a make-shift bipod or tripod, or resting the front of the rifle on some other stable platform, like a backpack.

, There are many stances for crouching.


A common one is to sit on one foot laid sideways on the ground while putting your other foot in front of you as tight to your body as possible, this will bring your knee toward your face. Having something against your back is never a bad idea. You then place the rifle in your hand which is resting on the knee in front of you.
You can also kneel or crouch behind anything hard, and rest the front of your gun (or bipod preferably) on it. Or you can use a ""kneeling roll"", this is nothing more than an old carpet, shirt or old pant leg rolled up and duct taped stuck up where the laces in your boot are and the ground. This position also requires a ""trick"", to make you more stable, point your forward foot's toes inboard to your trigger fingers arm. You should be able to make accurate shots at 450 yards (411.5 m) with this position.

, However, the best way to stand is against a tree or a rock to reduce some of the sway.


Yet another trick is to start with the rifle in your shoulder, pointed up at the sky, your trigger hand on the stock and your supporting arm on the fore-end stock. Bring the rifle down meanwhile tuck your supporting arm into your hip, lean back and calmly breathe at the same time your cheek weld is being applied. You can shoot accurately up to 300 yards (274.3 m) like this with proper practice.

, This often changes from person to person and changes a good deal depending on the situation. But the most common rifle position is the butt of the stock in the pocket of your shoulder (just above your armpit), your cheek lightly against the stock, looking down the sights or scope in the most relaxed position possible. For larger caliber rifles with more kick, the rifle should be brought in some so the butt is resting partially on the pectoral muscle.


A critical component of sniping is acquiring a good ""cheek weld"" or ""stock weld"". This means your cheek bone is held fast against the butt stock to insure proper sight alignment and sight picture. The pocket of your shoulder will absorb the recoil. Without a good cheek weld, parallax in your scope is guaranteed and you will never become proficient with any sniper weapon system/ optic-equipped rifle.

, The forearm should be pretty far forward on a traditional length grip which goes about 14 inches (35.6 cm) in front of the receiver.

, This affects the sway and oscillation of the gun, which in turn affects how consistent your shots can be.


Note: It also helps to practice 'stress firing', where you must take hasty shots with fatigue. Try running a quarter mile or whatever will bring up your heart rate and do enough push-ups so that your arms are twitching. Learn to compensate for the trembling in your muscles. If you only shoot paper targets, you can skip this, but in hunting or combat you may not have the luxury of rested muscles. At a minimum, try it as an experiment just to see to what degree stress impacts your ability to engage targets.
There are many different techniques for breathing while standing, often it is recommended to have your lungs most of the way full. Hold your breath and wait until the reticle goes over your target.
If you are a sniper, a sling is essential. Firing in a standing position is very fatiguing, especially supporting the barrel. A sling will help support the weight and allow the shooter a much higher degree of accuracy.
For prone and kneeling, it is best to open your mouth and throat until your body is relaxed, this is when most of your air has exited your lungs. Relax, if your heart rate is slow enough, you can stay like this for 10 or 15 seconds, be patient and wait until the reticle stops over your target.
Once you practice while exhaled a few times you will notice the reticle bounces in sync with your heart beat. You want to fire between beats (on the downbeat of your heart) which allows the most time for a stable shot (this will be only a fraction of a second, but that is when you are able to be most accurate).
Try to avoid eye fatigue. If you stare through the scope for more than 15 seconds, you are bound to develop parallax or lose focus on your target.

, When pulling the trigger (with any type of trigger), be sure to pull the trigger straight back toward your shoulder. Keep your firing hand and support hand loose and relaxed. You want to squeeze slowly, and release the hammer precisely when over the intended target.


If it will not damage your weapon, practice 'dry fire' exercises to develop good trigger control. It can help you develop skill without wasting ammunition or being so 'spooked' by the recoil you cannot focus on the trigger tension.
If the gun does not have a set trigger, then it likely has a trigger pull of about 2-5 pounds. In this case, you must get used to your trigger. Practice pulling the trigger most of the way back, just before the point the hammer releases. Try doing that until you are at the point that you can release the hammer (smoothly) on command. It is important never to fire before you want to, so be sure there is some threshold where you stop.
NOTE: Precision sniper rifles have two-stage triggers, so that you will know when you are about to fire. Otherwise the advice above is golden. If you do not pull the slack out of the trigger before committing to the shot, you are virtually guaranteed to miss your target. This applies to ALL firearms. Even black-powder rifles had two separate triggers, the second being the 'hair trigger'.
With a set trigger, the trigger pull is closer to 8-14 ounces. This makes life much easier. The effort to pull the trigger can be done as soon as you intend to shoot. Be sure to practice and get used to the light pull.

, The power can range from 1.5x to 50x for conventional rifles. Standard combat rifles or varmint rifles are usually zeroed at 100 yards (91.4 m) (we will assume, from now on, 100 yards is zero distance).


Depending on the selected zero range, bullet, and rifle (you must do research or testing to find the case with your setup) this may mean the bullet is below the reticle before zero, then above after zero, and eventually falls again to (at a different distance) be lined up with the reticle again (this may be 120 yards or 300, and it will likely change from rifle to rifle, even in the same caliber).

Another scenario is that the bullet climbs sooner, and from (say) 40 to 100 yards (36.6 to 91.4 m) is above the reticle, it then falls to meet your zero, and from then on (100 and more yards) is below the reticle (this is likely low-power rifles like .22LR).


The most conventional way to zero the scope is to fire a shot. Determine how far off target the bullet lands, then adjust the scope accordingly. Most scopes have windage and elevation knobs which can be turned to compensate for inaccuracies. The elevation is usually on the top and affects the bullet's point of impact (POI) vertically. The windage is usually on the right side of the scope and affects the bullet's POI horizontally.
Most scopes have either mil-dot or ballistic plex reticle which allows the shooter to easily line up a shot at distances further than the zeroed point. Most scopes come with a chart to show based on the bullet's caliber and weight where to line up the reticle. Though it would be much more accurate if you make your own chart.
While military snipers practice adjusting the windage and elevation for the specific situation, it usually isn't practical for hunters or recreational shooters to measure wind speed and other factors to the target and adjust the scope. It is often best just to do approximate calculations and ""hold-off"" the reticle, so re-zeroing the scope is not necessary. There are many factors that need to be taken into account when adjusting the scope, here are a few of them (in general order of priority):


Distance to target, bullet velocity, cross wind, bullet weight, shot angle, and others.
There are computer or PDA calculators which can calculate the exact landing position of the bullet based on all the information above (at least the major points). The calculators usually assume you re-zero your reticle. That is the best way to be perfectly accurate, but for target shooting where you don't need a one-shot-one-kill, re-zeroing is a lot of hassle.


Scopes (except low-end scopes) also have adjustable parallaxes which allow the shooter to essentially place the reticle on the same distance plane as the target. This is essential to take an accurate shot. Most parallaxes have distances listed on them, use them as basic guidelines.

A way to ""cheat"" the parallax is to place your head in a relief position where you can see black around the edge while viewing down the scope. Move your head and eye to make the black area even on all edges around the reticle.

Set up your rifle.,
Place a target 25 yards (22.9 m) away.,
Adjust the scope.,
Lower the crosshair slightly.,
Move the target to 100 yards (91.4 m).",How to Sight In a Rifle5," You will need to make sure that your rifle is completely immobile during the sighting process. You will need to be able to make adjustments to the sight without moving the rifle. This method will sight your rifle about 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) above the target at 100 yards (91.4 m).


This is a standard height for longer-distance shooting. At 200 and 300 yards, the bullet will drop towards the center of the target.
This method will not result in pin-point accuracy, but will be sufficient for deer-sized targets.
You can bore-sight before performing this method for increased accuracy and ease of sighting.

, Load a round into the rifle and place the center of the target in the center of the crosshairs. Fire a single shot without moving the rifle.


Squeeze with even pressure and continue squeezing after the shot is fired to prevent the gun from jumping.
Always follow strict safety guidelines when handling a live firearm. Never shoot when someone is downrange, and never point a loaded gun at another person.

, It is essential that the gun does not move during this process or the adjustments will be incorrect. Using the knobs on the scope, adjust it so that the crosshairs are directly over the bullet hole created by your first shot.


Most scopes move the crosshair in the opposite direction of the knob. For example, to move the crosshair down, you would twist the knob up.
You can make the bullet hole easier to see by placing a brightly-colored sticker over the hole on the target.

, Once the crosshair is lined up directly on the bullet hole, lower the crosshair so that it is pointing at a spot about half an inch below the bullet hole. This will make your gun shoot about 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) above the target at 25 yards (22.9 m).


Being 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) above the target at 25 yards (22.9 m) generally translates to 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) above at 100 yards (91.4 m), dead-on at 200 yards (182.9 m), and 8–12 inches (20.3–30.5 cm) below the target at 300 yards (274.3 m). This will vary based on the caliber, but is generally similar., Sight the rifle in the dead center of the bull’s-eye and carefully take the shot. Your bullet hole should be between 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) above the bull’s-eye. At this point, the rifle is sighted


Avoid shooting during winds to keep your bullet from drifting left or right.

Ask for help when you need it.,
Learn the left-hand spin first, and efficiently perform it numerous times.,
Learn how to hang on to and balance the rifle while it is spinning.,
Learn how to bring the rifle around your back and back to port arms.,
Okay, so now that you have learned the left-handed spin and can do it efficiently, it is time to learn how to two-handed spin.

,
Before you begin, do a few left-handed spins first to prepare yourself.,
When you do the left-handed spin that you are ready to start the two-handed spin on, the rifle should be in your left hand in the position where your fingers are facing up (the trigger of the rifle should also be facing up.),
Take your right hand and place it next to your left hand closer the the barrel of the rifle.,
You will be using your right hand to push the rifle off and back into your left hand.",How to Perform an Exhibition Two Handed Rifle Spin," That is what every Team Captain is told and taught to do. Don't be afraid to say you don't understand anything and need help. Otherwise, you will never accomplish anything in your program!;
, The ONLY way you will learn how to spin a rifle with both hands is if you learn how to do it with one hand first. The left-hand spin is a very easy move to become efficient in, and shouldn't take more than one or two weeks to get the hand of.

, This is essential! No control or balance of a rifle will cause you to eventually drop it, which Drill Inspectors count off major points for at Drill Meets.

, This is in case you screw up with the rifle but don't drop it.

,, And remember, control the rifle. Don't let it slip out of your hands!

, You should be holding the rifle about 3 or 4 inches (7.6 or 10.2 cm) from the trigger (not towards the butt of the rifle, towards the barrel!) Hold it here until you are ready to try the next step.

, Don't put your hands too close (as in make sure they aren't touching), they should be just a few centimeters away from each other.

, When you are in the position stated above, release your left hand and use your right hand to push the rifle off. Toss it a bit high so you can catch it in your left hand. You will catch it like you catch a left-handed spin (with the trigger of the rifle facing down), and ready to spin it again in the same manner shown above. Congratulations! You have just performed one of the most difficult and good-looking moves in Armed Exhibition. With time, you will master it well.

Locate the bolt handle, operating rod or similar device.,
Locate the magazine (often called the clip).,
To make the weapon ready to fire, pull back the operating rod or equivalent.,
To clear the weapon (remove all ammunition), remove or empty the magazine.,
Check the direction of fire.,
Release the safety.,
Grasp the grip (may look like a pistol grip); place your index finger on the side of the gun over the trigger.,
Hold the forestock (barrel area, usually covered in plastic or wood) of the gun with your 'off' hand or you can hold it close to the front end of the handguard for a more accurate shot.,
Bring the butt of the gun to the front of your shoulder, between your chest muscle (or breast) and the front ball of your shoulder.,
Tilt your head so the eye closest to the gun is looking straight down the top of the barrel.,

Check the target.,
Once you are finished, clear the gun.,
These guns are designed to put a bullets in the air in a short time, and if you are in a safe location, and have the ammunition, you may want to try some rapid fire.,
Take the gun down and clean it after it has cooled down.",How to Properly Shoot an Assault Rifle," You will have to operate this to put a cartridge in the chamber, clear stoppages and clear the weapon (make it safe).;
, Load it with cartridges, and insert it into the magazine well. Make sure it latches, or locks into place.

, A round (cartridge) should feed up from the magazine. Release the handle, and the bolt should slam home, feed a round into the chamber, and lock into place. If you are not immediately about to fire, engage the safety catch. DO NOT touch the trigger until you are about to fire.

, Next, retract the operation rod and inspect the chamber visually (look to see it is empty) and physically (put a finger into the chamber to check it is empty). It is usually a good idea to lock the bolt back if possible, to show at a distance that it is empty. Not all rifles are able to do this. AK/Kalashnikov rifles for instance cannot, though AR/AR15/M16-style ones can.

, If you are not sure of what is behind the target, do not fire. Ideally, you will be doing this at a shooting range, or a quarry with a high bank to shoot toward to stop stray bullets.

, This will probably be a lever or button on the side of the action, but this varies considerably according to the rifle in question.

, DO NOT touch the trigger until you are ready to fire.

, Note that the closer your off hand is to the front of the barrel, the more steady your support will be. (support hand)(if you're right handed use your left hand; if you're left handed use your right hand).

, If this feels awkward, move your support hand down the barrel or towards you until it feels right.

, Place this eye where it can see past the rear sight but not to the sides of it (don't put your eye right next to the sight, but make sure you are not looking over the sight). If you are pulling the trigger with your right hand the left side of the butt/stock should be firmly pressed against your right cheek below the cheek bone (this is called a gun mold).

, You will want to put the front sight in the 6 o'clock position, in the center of your sight picture, aligned with your target.

,, when you have just breathed out. U.S. Marine training tutorials advise that single shots should be taken while holding ones breath for no more than 3 seconds.

, If you determine that your round went right, correct to the left, if it goes left, correct right. This adjustment is called ""windage"". If you are shooting high, aim lower, or if you hit low, aim higher. This is known as elevation.

, Plan your next target or method.

, Most legal versions of assault rifles in the United States are semi-automatic, so they only fire once each time the trigger is squeezed, but by holding the rifle and rapidly squeezing and releasing the trigger, you may be able to achieve a faster rate of fire.

, Whenever possible, always clean the barrel by inserting the cleaning rod into the breach (back) of the barrel, not the muzzle (front). Depending on how the gas system is designed to operate, you may or may not need to clean the gas tube. Check for cleaning instructions specific to you rifle before you start, and beware small pins and springs. A magnet can help to keep track of these small parts, which are more common on modern AR designs.

",How to Own a Rifle,"


Hunting. This will require that the rifle will comply with hunting regulations in your area. Some regulations specify a minimum cartridge power for large game hunting. For instance, a .22 Long Rifle cartridge is not suitable for deer, bear, or elk, whereas in most areas, a .223 Remington, 22-250, or 220 Swift, which are also .22 caliber weapons, would have adequate power for thin-skinned animals such as deer, antelope, or coyote.
Target shooting.

Consider the cost of ammunition. Rimfire cartridges are much less expensive than center fire rounds.
Consider the distance you intend to shoot. For long range shooting, you may select a high velocity, lighter weight bullet, a heavier barrel, and a good scope. Shorter range ""plinking"" can be done with a semiautomatic rifle and ""iron sights.""


Self (home) defense. Here, you may choose a semiautomatic rifle with a large magazine, but in some circumstances, a handgun or shotgun is more effective for this application.;
, For an occasional weekend outing to the gun range or other appropriate shooting location, you will not need a high-end rifle that may cost thousands of dollars (U.S.). Select a good, sound rifle within your budget. Don't forget about older rifles including military surplus, which can be perfectly safe and enjoyable for both target shooting and hunting after being inspected by a qualified gunsmith, while offering a very high quality vs. price ratio.

, In many places, owning an ""assault"" type weapon is illegal in any circumstance, while other jurisdictions may require you to obtain special licenses, registrations, and/or courses on safely handling a firearm. Most, if not all, jurisdictions require a gun owner to be ""legal age"" (either 18 or 21 years old, depending on where you live).

, You may not want to go to a high-end sporting goods or shooting supply store for your first rifle. Big box stores in many locations sell rifles and other guns at lower prices than specialty stores.

, Very large, heavy rifles may not be suitable for small or petite persons. The rifle should ""fit"" into your shoulder ""pocket"" comfortably, and the sight should be easy to see. You may also want to consider the ""hand"" of the rifle. Some have ""left hand"" models specifically manufactured for left-handed shooters.

, Talk to the sales person so that you are completely familiar with the weapon you have chosen. This includes:


Loading and unloading.
Bullet caliber, weight, and range.
Features. This includes the safety, sight adjustments, magazine capacities, and other accessories.

, For the first ten rounds or so, you should wet-swab (oil-dampened cotton cloth on a rod) then dry-swab your barrel between every shot. Then for another ten, do it every three rounds. After that, every ten rounds for the next one hundred. Now your rifle's barrel is ""broken in"" and cleaning it after every time you are out at the range should be easy.

, If safety is ever disregarded, it could end your rifle shooting fun - permanently!


One of the most fundamental firearm safety rules is to keep your muzzle pointed in a safe direction at all times. Always point it downrange or down at the ground. When you are ready to fire, no one should be in front of you, and you should be aware of what you target is, what is behind it, and what is around it.

, This makes it easy to hit, but it allows you to sight in your rifle as the sights may not be exactly where you want them. As you get better, you can increase the distance.

,


Place the butt of the stock on the inside of the ""pocket"" of your shoulder (slightly on your pectoral muscle). The support hand should be holding up the front of the rifle, with the elbow bent and pointed down toward the ground. The firing hand should be on the grip just rear of your trigger guard. Never put your finger inside of your trigger guard until you intend to fire. Place your cheek on the stock so you can look down the rifle.
For an un-scoped rifle, focus hard on your front sight, then place the center post in the middle of the intended target. For a scoped rifle, the center of the crosshairs should be on the center of the target.

, Slowly take deep breaths and exhale. Focus on your front sight (or your reticle) and attempt to keep the rifle as steady as possible. Exhale most of the air from your lungs; you want to be in a completely relaxed state (do not force the air out of your lungs; just let it flow out slowly).

, The slower you do it, the better. Eventually you will hear a ""click"" (remember, you are unloaded right now). Cycle the action, then repeat the process a few times. Dry-practice is never something you stop doing; even world-class firearms shooters dry-practice!

, Load a magazine or en-bloc system (alternatively, most rifles allow you to load a round directly into your chamber). Repeat the process above (the dry-run), remembering to relax your body, lower your heart rate, and slowly apply pressure to your trigger.

, Firing while prone (laying down) is often the best way to be accurate (aside from bench resting). Try it out - all the same rules apply. Remain relaxed and comfortable; you will find that while crouching or prone, the sway of the gun is minimized.

, Take a few steps back and challenge yourself; that is the only way you will get better.


Most shooters cut their groupings in half (are twice as accurate) the second time they go out shooting, and again the third time. You will find that if you keep up on your practice, and you continually challenge yourself to new levels of marksmanship, you will be better every time you are at the range!

, The barrel is the most important part of an accurate rifle, so wet-swab the barrel with clean swabs until they come out of the barrel clean. While the barrel is important for accuracy, the receiver is important for reliability. Refer to either the rifle's manual or an experienced shooter to tell you how to best clean the receiver. Remember to clean your weapon before and after every shooting exercise.

, Be vigilant to store your firearms and ammunition in a safe place that is inaccessible to children or pets. Teach your children to respect the power of a firearm.

,,

Pull the bolt back and visually and physically (stick your finger in there) check there aren't any cartridges in the magazine well or in the chamber.

Work the bolt.",How to Load Winchester Model 190," The first time you load and shoot a Winchester Model 190, you should use standard velocity .22 LR ammo.


There is no specific brand you need to look for.
As an older gun, the Winchester 190 generally works best with conventional ""no frills"" ammunition. It was also considered a ""budget gun"" in its time, so it had a greater tendency to jam than more advanced firearms produced in the same era. This means that the gun may jam if you use hollow points or high velocity rounds like stingers.
Since no two Winchester 190 owners may share the same firing experience even if they use the same ammo, it is generally best to try several different brands and types of 22 caliber long rifle bullet in your firearm. Do not use ammo with a different caliber or ammo designed for other types of firearm.;
, Even if you believe that the gun is currently unloaded, you should treat it as though it may already be loaded and ready to fire at any moment.It is especially important at this time to point the muzzle of the barrel in a safe direction. For loading purposes, you will need to keep the barrel and magazine tube in upright, near vertical positions with the muzzle pointing skyward. You should, however, tilt the gun forward slightly in a direction pointing away from all other beings and valuable property, since a misfired bullet could cause severe injury if it were to fire straight up and drop back down.
You must also keep your finger off the trigger and outside of the trigger guard at all times while loading the rifle.

, Locate the cap on the magazine tube. Squeeze or twist this cap until you feel it come loose.


There are two metal cylinders leading out from the chamber of the gun. The larger top cylinder is the barrel, and it is through this cylinder that the bullets will fire. The bottom cylinder is the magazine tube. You will load the ammo into the magazine tube, so it is this cylinder that you will be working with throughout the process. The cap referred to in this step should be located at the entrance of the magazine tube cylinder.
The cap is not a separate piece, so it will not come off as you squeeze or unscrew it. This cap is actually attached to a hidden cylinder called a “follower,” which will be handled in the next step.

, Pull the magazine cap forward. As you do, the follower inside of the magazine tube should slide out.


Continue to carefully slide out the follower until it is completely out of the magazine tube. Set it aside for the time being.
The follower is a hidden cylinder that fits snugly inside the magazine tube. Its purpose is to push and direct the ammo down into the action so that the bullets will cycle through the rifle properly. You will not be able to load the gun while the follower is still in place, however.

, Locate the loading slot at the side of the magazine tube. Place your bullets into the magazine through this slot, continuing until the magazine tube is full.Insert the bullets into the magazine tube one at a time.
The bullets must be inserted with the pointed tip facing the entrance of the magazine tube and the blunt end facing the back of the gun.
You should be able to fit a total of 15 to 16 bullets into the magazine tube.
The slot should be located on the bottom side of the magazine tube. It is usually blocked by the follower, but removing the follower opens it up and grants access to it. If your particular Winchester Model 190 does not have this slot, you will need to load the ammo directly into the front opening of the magazine tube, where the cap previously sat.

, Slide the follower back into the magazine tube and twist the cap to secure it.


Slide the uncapped end of the follower into the magazine tube. You should be able to push the entire follower into the magazine without any resistance. If you are unable to fit the entire follower inside, you may have too many bullets loaded into the magazine. You will need to remove several by inverting the magazine tube upside-down; the extras should fall out due to the force of gravity.
After replacing the follower, you need to make sure that the cap is tight and secure at its opening. If the cap is loose, the follower is loose, and it may not be able to direct the bullets into the action properly. If this happens, you may experience a jam or other firing problem.
Once the follower is secure again, the gun is loaded and should be ready to fire.

, When unloading a loaded gun, you must handle it with special care to prevent injury or death.


Even if the safety mechanism is on and you think the gun may not be loaded, you must still treat it as though it were loaded
Keep all fingers off of the trigger while unloading the gun. Your fingers must remain to the outside of the trigger guard throughout the entire process.
You should also point the muzzle of the gun in a safe direction throughout the entire procedure. You will need to tilt the barrel and magazine tube at different angles at different points of the process, but regardless of the specifics, you should always make sure that the gun is not pointing at any living being or valuable property.

, Cycle the bolt to open the chamber. If there is a bullet sitting in the chamber, this action should cause the bullet to eject from the gun.


Even though this is a semi-automatic gun and not a bolt-action rifle, there is still a bolt that allows you to manually manipulate the chamber. The bolt on a Winchester Model 190 is a small knob located at the side of the chamber.
When the chamber is closed, this bolt will face toward the front of the gun. When you pull the bolt toward the back of the gun, the chamber should open and the bullet inside should be ejected.

, Point the muzzle in a safe direction and look down into the chamber from the back of the gun. Verify that there are no other bullets inside the chamber or barrel of the gun.


You should approach the gun from the back as you look down into the chamber. Do not look into the chamber from the front of the firearm.
If there are additional bullets in the chamber, you may need to tap the outside of the gun barrel to help free the trapped bullet. After freeing the bullet, you should be able to drop it out of the chamber opening.

, Pinch or unscrew the cap on the magazine tube follower to loosen it.


Manipulate the cap in the same manner used when removing the follower during the loading process.

, Pull the follower cap forward. As you do this, the follower should glide out of the magazine tube.


As you do while loading the gun, you must make sure that the follower is completely removed from the magazine tube before you can proceed further with unloading.

, Carefully tip the gun forward until the magazine tube is vertical and pointing down toward the ground. Most ammunition in the magazine should drop out naturally due to gravity.You may hear the bullets moving around inside the magazine and dropping out. Do not rely on the sound of the ammo to determine when the gun is fully unloaded, though, since it may not make any noise, especially if some of the bullets are lodged in the magazine tube.

, Use your hand to strike the side of the magazine tube while it is still inverted. Doing so should loosen any trapped ammo inside the magazine tube, causing it to drop out.


Start striking the magazine toward the back end or chamber of the gun. Gradually work your way down the magazine tube, then back up again toward the chamber.

, Return the rifle to a standard yet safe position and cycle the bolt a few more times. If there are any bullets remaining in the gun before you do this, cycling the bolt should eject that ammo.


Push the bolt forward and back several times. There is some risk that ammo could have been caught in between the chamber and the magazine, and working the bolt several times should help loosen and free these bullets.
After completing this step, the Winchester Model 190 will probably be fully unloaded and safe to handle.

"
"
Dismantle the firearm.,
Identify the parts you are cleaning.",How to Maintain a Rifle2," Read the manual of the firearm on how to do this. On bolt-action rifles, it is usually only a matter of releasing the bolt. On auto-loading rifles, the tear-down will be more complex.

, The two primary areas that will require cleaning are the barrel and the receiver and action.

The barrel is the key factor attributing to the accuracy of the rifle. Be cautious with the muzzle-end of the barrel and the beginning of the rifling (inside the barrel), as these are the two most important things to affect accuracy and can easily affect it adversely, if damaged.






Receiver and action is the bolt, chamber, and trigger assembly. The bolt holds the ammunition in the chamber and the trigger assembly initiates the process which makes the firearm go boom. This area primarily affects reliability and ease of operation, but can also reduce accuracy if poorly maintained. For most rifles, the stock and receiver are one unit, and cannot be dismantled without tools.







"
"
Wipe down all components using some paper towel (or cloth, but this is less important to be lint-free).,
Spray solvent (preferably designed to be safe to continually contact your skin, like M-Pro 7) on all possibly dirty components.,
Let the solvent sit for a couple minutes.,
Scrub the whole gun with a brush (no metal bristles — like a toothbrush).,
Wipe the gun clean with lint-free cloth (you can buy pre-cut cloth, but a clean old shirt or socks also work).,
Wipe down the whole gun (inside and out) with a solvent-soaked lint-free cloth again, and look again for any areas turning the cloth dark, and clean it.

,
Use the pick to get off any thick chunks of carbon or powder buildup, or buildup in tight parts of the gun.",How to Maintain a Rifle3,"


Remove as much of the thick, caked-on carbon buildup created by the friction of use. Also wipe off any old oil and all unburnt powder buildup.
Be sure to wipe the inside of the magazine well (if available), the ejector, and the area around the chamber. You will find certain areas turn the paper towel black (clean these areas more).
On this step, precision is not required; wipe it quickly.

,


Many rifle manufacturers design components (even polymer and the stock) to be safely used with any solvent, but be sure there aren't types of solvents the manufacturer warns against.
A liberal amount of solvent is better than not enough.

, Make sure any area with dirt, carbon buildup, or unburnt powder has a healthy amount of solvent on it, soaking in.

, This works in the solvent and loosens up the buildup on the gun. Try to get into all the nooks and crannies.


On a bolt-action rifle, be sure to scrub all nooks and crannies of the bolt (when it is removed from the receiver).
On a gas-operated rifle, special care may be required while cleaning the gas rod area, gas tubes, or gas inlet.

, Get everywhere you put the solvent (should be pretty much everywhere) and wipe it until it wipes clean.

,,


The most common area with carbon deposits is in the chamber. Buildup occurs in the corners of the pieces of metal.

"
"
Use a bore brush to break any buildup free from the barrel.,
Swab the barrel with a cloth soaked with solvent.,
Swab the barrel with a cloth soaked in copper solvent.,
Do not oil your bore.,
Swab the barrel with a dry cloth before you start shooting.,
Clean your barrel every ten shots if you require top accuracy.",How to Maintain a Rifle4,"


Run the full length of the barrel at least five times (more if you have shot a lot since the last cleaning).
Be sure not to reverse direction with the brush (in the barrel), push it all the way through, then all the way back (letting the bristles changed direction outside of the barrel).

, Repeat with clean cloths (still soaked in solvent) until a cloth comes out clean. Run the swabs from the receiver to the muzzle (in only this direction).


The number of times needed to clean the bore will vary greatly depending on many variables. It may take as many as 20+ passes to clean the barrel properly on a very dirty rifle.
Use a bore guide to prevent rubbing the metal rod against the initial rifling.
Use a rod which is made from a soft metal like aluminum. Harder metals can easy scratch your barrel.

, This removes any copper which may have come off of a jacketed bullet during it's travel down the barrel. A few passes may be required (repeat until no copper particles are visible on the cloth, then do it once more).

, There is no advantage to adding gun oil down the barrel, and this increases the chance of buildup of dust and powder/copper/lead residue which can lead to jams and squibs (when a bullet gets caught in the barrel). Contrary to popular belief, oil does not neutralize solvent.

, This produces consistent results and ensures the solvents are neutral, while keeping your barrel dry for the first shot.

, The bore brush is not a required step for standard cleaning, but may be desired for a complete clean.

"
"
Oil all the components requiring lubrication.,
Reassemble the rifle and make sure all parts are functioning properly.

,
Wipe down the whole gun and remove any excess oil.

",How to Maintain a Rifle5," Often the manual for the gun will have specific areas needing oil, but a quick look at where the gun is wearing will give you a good indication of the needs.


Be sure to oil the areas around rotating parts, such as the bolt and trigger assembly.
Try to keep oil away from the openings into the firing pin housing (oil is a collector of dirt and powder buildup, and buildup around your firing pin can prevent it from firing).
Don't forget to oil the bolt rails and the grooves in which they ride.

Take full control of the weapon system with both hands.,
Remember ""Safety"" is the most important thing to remember when handling not just the SA80, but any weapon system.

If an instructor is present, you will hear the words of command ""LOAD!"",
Carry out the following actions.,
On the word of command ""LOAD!,Before fitting the magazine to the weapon, you must insure that the rounds (Bullets) are inserted correctly to the magazine and that it is free of dirt/dust or any other foreign objects

, Pick up the rifle. Hold the pistol grip with your right hand, your right index finger should rest on the trigger guard, not the trigger. Your left hand should hold the handguard (big green bit with holes along the top at the front). The butt (the bit at the back) should be between your shoulder and your collar bone. Your cheek should be resting on the plastic just in front of the butt. Your elbows should be tucked in quite a lot and resting securely on the ground. Have a look through the sights.

, Check the bolt and chamber for any rounds or damage.(7 point check) When you are sure that the rifle is clear then with your left hand push the release catch to allow the working parts to move forward. Remove the safety and fire off the action with an aimed shot. Re-apply the safety catch.

, Keep hold of the pistol grip with your right hand but let go with your left. Use your left hand to pick up the magazine. Check that the round edge of the magazine is backwards, and that the bullets face forwards (pointy bit goes forward). Tap the magazine against the housing. Now push it into the black housing. Try to pull it out. If you can pull it out push it back in and wriggle it around. Better? Is it the right way round? Push down with the rifle if the magazine still refuses to go in.

Follow through.",How to Fire a Rifle," Different rifles are operated in different ways, and since the first thing you need to do upon picking up a rifle is check to see if it's loaded, you need to learn how to load and unload different kinds of rifles.While specific models, brands, and styles will vary widely, there are two basic varieties of rifles that you'll encounter:


Bolt-action rifles fire when a sliding bolt is manually operated to advance and eject the ammunition casings, which are fed into the firing chamber from a magazine, or loaded directly into the firing chamber, one round at a time.
Semi-automatic rifles are also magazine-fed, but advance each round into the chamber automatically after a round is fired. To advance the first round into the chamber, you need to usually pull back a small bolt, much like on a bolt-action rifle.;
, Each and every time you pick up the gun, you need to check it to see whether or not it's loaded and make sure the safety is on. Most safeties will be located just to the front of the trigger guard, though some will be placed elsewhere. Check the owner's guide for the specific rifle you're firing to make sure you know where the safety is located.


To check if a bolt-action rifle is unloaded, make sure the safety is on, then pull the bolt backward. Remove the magazine, if necessary. If you see there is nothing in the firing chamber, and the magazine it out, the gun is unloaded.
To check if a semi-automatic rifle is unloaded, remove the magazine if necessary, and pull the bolt on the rifle back. Look into the firing chamber to ensure nothing is present. If there isn't, and the magazine is out, the gun is unloaded.

, The single basic rule of gun safety is to treat all firearms as if they were loaded, at all times. Every time you pick up a rifle, you need to check to see if it's loaded. Every time you put down a rifle, you need to check to see if it's loaded. Even after checking to see if the gun is loaded, you treat the gun as if it were. This is the only way to ensure that accidents don't happen.


Keep the safety on at all times when you're handling the rifle. Never switch the safety off unless you've aimed the gun in a safe direction, are holding the gun securely, and are about to fire the rifle.
Keep the barrel of the gun pointed downrange at all times. When you're firing a rifle, never point the gun in the direction of anyone, or swing the gun around horizontally. The barrel of the rifle should be pointed in a safe direction whenever you pick it up.
Keep your finger off the trigger. Whenever you're handling the gun, even when the safety is on, you need to keep your finger clear of the trigger. Never move your finger into position to fire the rifle until you've aimed the gun in a safe direction, have turned the safety off, and are ready to fire.

, Rifles need to be fired at shooting ranges, gun clubs, or on private property with sufficient safe space for shooting. Rifle rounds can travel long distances, making it absolutely essential that you only shoot rifles in areas in which you're sure of what's beyond the target.


Shooting ranges and gun clubs are usually the easiest ways of shooting rifles, providing specific ranges, with a variety of targets and distances for you to practice. Find a gun club in your area that you can join for target practice.

, Again, the best way to practice shooting your rifle is at well-kept and maintained shooting ranges, at which you can be sure of the safety of the targets and the backdrops at which you're firing.


Paper targets are the best way to test your accuracy, and should be backed with earth-mounds or other professional backing that will help to trap the bullet and decrease the possibility of a ricochet.
Steel targets offer a distinctive ""ping"" when shot accurately, and are actually safer than it may seem. Steel targets should be angled and only shot while wearing safety goggles. While all targets present the possibility of ricochet injury, properly maintained steel targets at the appropriate distance don't ricochet more than other types of targets.Targets need to be at least 20–50 yards (18.3–45.7 m) away, or preferably more. Most rifle ranges have a variety of target distances. ""Long"" range starts around 100 yards (91.4 m).Cartridges will also provide a minimum safe shooting distance, which you should always extend slightly. If it says 25 yards (22.9 m), chalk that up to 30 to be safe.

, Rifle cartridges are measured in terms of caliber, which refers to the diameter of the individual cartridges, which should match the diameter of the inside of the rifle's barrel. Depending on the rifle you have access to, you need to use only the size of ammunition that matches the rifle.


If you're trying to buy a rifle, the most common calibers of rifle are usually .22 and .30. .22 rifles are a good first gun.

, Any time you're firing a rifle, it's important to have the proper safety equipment in place. Gun safety requires good practices and also good protective equipment to keep everyone safe.


Safety glasses should be worn at all times when firing rifles. If you wear glasses, it's still a good idea to wear polycarbonate safety goggles over them.
Hearing protection, including ear plugs and more substantial wrap-around ear protection, needs to be used at all times, especially in shooting galleries, in which lots of people are firing at once.

, In marksmanship training, soldiers are required to hold their rifles so steady a hammer could fall on the barrel and the shot would still be accurate. Shooting is a matter of form, not luck or muscle strength. Practice shooting from different positions and find the one you feel most comfortable firing from, then keep practicing the others anyway. Good marksmanship involves being comfortable shooting from any of the following positions, with the basic fundamentals of shooting in place:


Standing position. In this position, you'll stand with the hip of your non-trigger hand pointing at the target, and will support the rifle with your elbows in tight to your torso to make it as comfortable as possible. This is the most difficult position from which to make accurate shots.
Kneeling position. This is a steady position that allows you to balance your supporting hand on your knee, making it one of the most comfortable and steady positions from which to shoot.
Sitting position involves sitting cross-legged, balancing both the shooting and the supporting elbows on each of your knees. While the sitting position is somewhat less comfortable than it may seem, it's extremely secure, especially if you can control your breathing.
Prone position. This is the most accurate shooting position for many shooters, offering you the most support possible, allowing you to use your close proximity to the ground to steady yourself.

, When you pick up the gun, always be sure to check and double-check that the gun is unloaded. Only load the gun when you're set and ready to fire. Pick up the gun, keeping the barrel pointed downrange, and place your hands on the handgrip and the stock correctly.


Hold the handgrip, just behind the trigger, with your dominant hand. Keep your hand well back of the trigger when you’re first getting situated. Your finger should be nowhere near the trigger.

, Up-turn your palm and use your fingers to create a “V” with your steadying hand. Seat the stock of the gun into your supporting hand, about halfway between the barrel of the gun and the trigger. Experiment some with your grip to get a sense of what's most comfortable for you.


Expert rifle marksmen generally support the rifle fairly close to the trigger guard, because it'll strain your muscles less to hold the gun upright.

, While rifles don't kick anything like shotguns, it's still important to secure the rifle in the pocket created by your shoulder and armpit, pulling it firmly into the muscle just inside of your shoulder. It should neither be resting against your gun nor your shoulder bone, but the muscle that connects them.

, After you've taken hold of the gun properly, get into firing position and maintain what's called ""cheek to stock weld."" Holding the gun properly, you should be able to let your head fall over gently to the side, letting your cheek rest against the butt of the rifle and align your eye with the sights. If you need to readjust some, carefully readjust and resettle yourself to make the position comfortable., Once your eye is aligned, you need to learn to aim the gun properly. The process is slightly different, depending on the variety of sighting mechanism included with your rifle. Some rifles have telescopic sights, commonly referred to as ""scopes"" while other rifles feature simpler bead-style sights on the top of the barrel.


Bead-style sights are aimed by lining up the bead at the very end of the barrel even with the port farther back on the gun. The bead at the end needs to be the same height and just between the ""V"" created by the port. Usually, these are marked with green or red luminescent dots. When you're firing, focus your eye on the bead, not on the target itself.
Telescopic sights are like telescopes mounted on the top of the barrel, which usually feature a cross-hair style sight imposed on the magnified image. Shooting involves lining up the point at which the lines cross and training it directly on what you want to shoot. It'll take some practice to line up your eye accurately with the sight, staying far enough back to get an accurate sight picture.

, Lots of chatter is given to breathing while you shoot, but the actual process goes a lot more smoothly the less you think about it. Breathe naturally and comfortably, taking full and normal breaths, then fire immediately after exhaling.


Fire in the second immediately following an exhale for the most accurate shot. Studies show you're at your steadiest as soon as air is expelled from your lungs.
Never ""hold your breath"" to fire. Holding your breath creates an automatic and unconscious waver in your body, as it reacts to being deprived of oxygen. It's less accurate than a shot fired immediately after an exhale.

, When you're aimed and ready to shoot, load the gun and make sure the field is clear of people and obstacles. It's common range courtesy to let everyone know that you're about to shoot before you start popping off rounds. When you're ready and steady, it's ok to switch off the safety on the gun.

, Keep aiming and maintain a proper sight picture on the target at which you're aiming. Breathe normally and switch off the safety. Your finger should be outside the trigger guard, resting gently against it. When you're ready and comfortable, move it onto the trigger and squeeze it gently but firmly, then release it and return your finger to the side of the trigger, letting it rest gently.Avoid jerking or “pulling” the trigger of the rifle. You want to fire quickly, but a jerky trigger finger can make microscopic changes in your aim, which can be enough to miss widely. Practice squeezing, as if you were trying to pull something just behind the trigger, rather than pull the trigger.

, It's likely you want to see what you hit, and it's possible to get all excited and want to drop the gun and run down range. Just like in basketball or tennis, your follow-through is important to making accurate shots. Be very careful and stay secure in your position after firing.


Re-safety the weapon immediately and keep the gun pointed downrange. Most shooting accidents happen immediately after the gun has been fired safely. Continue aiming and staying in your position, then let the gun come back down to rest gently, keeping the barrel pointed down range.
If you're shooting a bolt-action rifle, you can operate the slide-bolt to eject the spent casing, and rack another into place, if you want to keep shooting. It's a good idea to re-safety the weapon, either way.

Wipe off all excess oil with another clean rag.",How to Clean a Revolver," With the gun pointed in a safe direction and with your finger off the trigger, hold the gun by the grip. Using your thumb, push the cylinder release to open it up. With your other hand, reach over the top of the gun and push the cylinder out. Check to see that there are no cartridges in the cylinder or the chamber. Push out and set aside any bullets.





;
, Keep all of your supplies close by. You don't want to be walking around, dirtying your hands, or constantly pick up new things that may bring unwanted dirty near your gun. Wash and dry your hands once you have everything ready to work.









If you've never cleaned a revolver, check out this list of necessary cleaning supplies.

You can also purchase pre-made cleaning sets at most gun stores, usually for around $50., The rear cylinder is the part above the trigger, where the hammer hits the chamber to fire a shot. Wrap an old, long sock around this opening to prevent cleaning brushes from getting in and ruining the revolver.

, Bronze bristle brushes are less aggressive and are fine for removing powder residue. Steel brushes are more aggressive and can wear on the barrel, but may be useful in situations with old, caked-on, and hard deposits. Stick with bronze unless you have a reason to use steel. Nylon brushes are also available, but bronze is a good compromise in most cases.








If you are shooting jacketed bullets, you will have some copper-colored gilding metal in the bore. To remove copper (gilding metal), you will need to use a solvent designed to remove copper. Your gun dealer can guide you in selecting this. Copper solvent will eventually dissolve the bronze bristles on your brush. In that case, you can use a steel brush (sparingly) or a nylon brush while you are using copper solvents.
If you are shooting non-jacketed bullets, you may have lead in the bore. Your gun dealer can guide you in selecting a product to help remove lead., Revolvers are twisted inside, which spins the bullet for greater accuracy. You want to follow these grooves naturally with the brush to clean deep inside of them. Push all the way through the barrel, then pull the brush back through the other way. 








Keep the brush in the center of the barrel, only applying light pressure.Sometimes bore brushes are simply called wire brushes.
Give the revolver a minute to soak if the rifle is extra dirty.

, After the bore brush, get out your cleaning rod and attach a clean patch. If it isn't lubricated, dip it in cleaning solvent and run it through the barrel gently. If it comes out very dirty, get a new patch and repeat.








, Once you've finished with the solvent, get as much out of the barrel as possible. That said, remember that you still need to be gentle, going with the flow of the barrel instead of forcing it down.







, If you don't have a cleaning kit, a rag or toothbrush with some cleaning solvent will be perfect. Lightly scrub away the outside of the revolver -- hitting the in and outside of the cylinders, the trigger, the muzzle, and rear cylinder. Pull the extractor rod out of the center of the cylinder and clean that out as well.








, Push all the way through, then pull the bore brush back. Make sure you go through all the way, taking your time. Hold the gun so that it rests on the muzzle, allowing the solvent to drip harmlessly to the floor. Add a little more solvent for each cylinder.







, Remember to replace them, and use extra patches if they still come out dirty. When done, make sure your unlubricated patches get everything dry.








, Rub down the entire exterior of the gun with a small amount of gun oil. Avoid the hand grips as well as inside the barrels and cylinders. Wipe in small circles, adding more oil when necessary.







, You want it to be shiny, not oily or greasy. When done, you can finish the cleaning with a silicone gun cloth, which will leave the rifle as shiny as new.

Consider your personal defense needs.,
Determine your basic point-shoot at the range before buying.,
Choose a larger pistol for greater accuracy and range.,
Choose a smaller pistol if you need to carry it on your person.,
Know that chamber caliber matters as much as size when choosing a gun.,
Know that revolvers are considered more reliable and simpler than semi-autos.",How to Choose the Right Pistol (Handgun)1," Pistols are used almost exclusively for self-defense. Thus, you need to consider why you need the pistol and envision the places you intend to carry it. Do you plan on carrying it with you at all times, or is it staying in the house? Do you want something that will stop people and work as a crime deterrent, or do you want something with enough power to end the standoff violently?


These decisions make a big difference on the size, shape, and type of pistol you choose.
Think long and hard about whether or not you could ever pull the trigger on another human. It may seem like a good idea to pull the gun out without shooting to scare a criminal off. But, more often than not, a gun escalates the situation, and will make things much, much worse if you're not willing to shoot it.;
, You must find out how comfortably you can aim a gun before buying it. With an unloaded gun, close your eyes and point the gun in a safe direction with your finger next to the trigger, but not on it, at a makeshift target. Open your eyes — the sights should be lined up exactly where you wanted them. At five yards, it should be no more than a couple inches off center-target.


If you're too low, try a lighter gun. Too high, you might want something heavier.
If the handgun is pointing high or low, this can be compensated for with practice. For example, almost everyone who has never used a Glock before has a high point-shoot location by 6–10 inches (15.2–25.4 cm) at five yards. But with practice, you will find that you can compensate for that quickly.
Sample a variety of guns whenever possible. You want the one that feels comfortable in your hand when shooting, or a ""more accurate"" model might not do you any good.

, Larger pistols are more accurate than smaller ones due to their fit to the hand, weight (reduced felt recoil), and longer sight plane. They are, however, much harder to conceal and carry, and the added weight may make them difficult to aim and maneuver for some people.


Also called ""combat pistols"" or ""duty-pistols.""
Most people will have greater success shooting a full sized pistol, as the recoil and fit often lead to a more comfortable shooting experience.The 1911, Glock 17 or 22, and Beretta M9 are all good examples of popular combat pistols., Smaller pistols are easier to conceal and are lighter to carry, but they trade off some power and accuracy. However, because they are smaller they are often easier to aim, especially for smaller people.


Conceal-carry guns have a length of 4.5-6 inches and are light and small.
Often sold as ""compact,"" ""snubnose,"" or ""conceal-carry"" pistols.
The Glock 26 or 27, Kahr PM9, and the Colt Mustang XSP are all highly rated conceal-carry guns., The caliber bullet you're shooting does not change evenly with the size of the gun. Each caliber has it's own strengths and weaknesses, and you need to find one that fits your needs instead of just going for the highest number you can find. Beginners should aim for smaller calibers.


Smaller calibers mean less recoil, which in turn means faster and more accurate follow-up shots, but generally less energy and force. A good starting point is .380 ACP caliber bullets, common in smaller pistols.Larger calibers inflict more damage per bullet, but are harder to squeeze multiple shots off quickly. Try out .45 ACP, 10mm, or .357 sig for a autoloader or a .357 Magnum or .41 mag for a revolver., A revolver is easy to load, point, and shoot, and have been popular options for decades. They are also easier to clean and maintain than most semi-automatics. That said, comfort holding and shooting should be your first concern when getting a pistol.

Make sure the round has jammed and not misfired.,
Keep the weapon pointed in a safe direction at all times when attempting to clear the jam.

,
If using an approach through the gun's barrel to clear a jam, use pliers or another tool to grip the cleaning rod or other tool you are removing the round with so your hand is never in front of the muzzle.

,
Make sure the ammunition you are using is suitable for your weapon before loading and firing it.,
Consider the risk of using a gun that isn't feeding/firing correctly.",How to Clear a Cartridge Jam in a Handgun1," It is suggested you allow the handgun to remain pointed in a safe direction for several minutes before attempting to clear the jam in the event it is a delayed fire, and not a jam. For rounds that fired and left the empty shell casing stuck in the chamber, this step can be omitted.;
,,, Here are examples of potential ammunition problems that can cause jams:


Old, corroded, bent, or malformed ammunition.
Ammunition that has been incorrectly reloaded.
Ammunition that has been exposed to moisture or extreme temperatures.
Ammunition that is the incorrect caliber or style for your weapon.

, Yes, you can probably clear a simple jam and continue shooting your handgun, but in the long run, if there are either mechanical issues or underlying problems with the gun, you might be putting yourself or others at risk by doing so. A trip to a qualified gunsmith might be money well spent.

Look in your city's local phone directory or perform an online search to locate the names and addresses of Nevada gun dealerships you can visit.
Bring your identification and fees with you to the gun dealership.

, After deciding on the type of gun you want to buy, the dealer will provide you with a form to complete for the background check.


Enter the information required on the form; including your full name, type of gun you plan on buying, maiden or former names, gender, date of birth, and state of residence.

, After receiving your completed form, the gun dealer will call the POS program to conduct the background check. You can buy a gun after passing the background check.


The background check can only be conducted daily between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m., excluding legal holidays. If you visit a gun dealership outside of these hours, you may have to revisit the gun dealership at another time to complete the background check.
In some cases, the POS representative performing the background check may ask the dealer for additional information about yourself; such as your race, height, weight, Social Security Number, or other characteristics.

, Most counties in Nevada allow you to buy your gun and take it home after passing the background check; however, if you reside in Clark County (excluding Boulder City), you will be required to wait 24 hours to receive your gun.

Consider both the benefits and drawbacks of each bullet type.,
Understand the caliber of most common handgun bullets.,
Disregard ""knock-down power"" when shopping for a pistol.",How to Choose the Right Pistol (Handgun)2," Most people who study handgun bullet ballistics and tactics have concluded that handgun rounds are weak comparatively, and bullet-placement is a more reliable fight-stopper than the round itself. However, there are some advantages from one round to another, and knowing what caliber you're search for will help you make the most of your purchase.



Penetration is extremely important. If a bullet does not penetrate deep enough, vital organs and the nervous system are less likely to be damaged. In the late '90s the FBI conducted extensive studies which suggest a bullet should penetrate at least 14–16 inches (35.6–40.6 cm) to be reliable. This allows for bullets to enter a body at less than optimal angles and still have enough energy to reach vital organs or the spine.

Permanent cavity is the resulting ""void"" in a fleshy target where the majority of a bullet's energy was transferred and tissue was destroyed. The larger the permanent cavity, the greater the chance of vital organs or central nervous system being destroyed.

Recoil is something that is often not talked about in bullet ballistics because it is a very subjective and weapon-specific characteristic. Low recoil allows you put place more shots quicker and more accurately. Each person will have a different feel for the recoil of a bullet, and each handgun will transfer the recoil to the user in different ways.

Bullet energy is an over-emphasized feature of a round. In handguns, energy of bullets is extremely low. ""Knock down power"" is a fable born of Hollywood action movies scenes. People shot with a .22LR in non-vital areas have fallen down because they assumed being shot is synonymous with falling down and possibly dying., There are a lot of different calibers out there, and it will be daunting for the uninitiated to figure out what to buy without a basic primer:


9mm Parabellum is the most common pistol caliber. Its relatively low recoil allows for quick, accurate follow up shots. The magazine capacity is usually much greater than other larger rounds. Cost is low and availability is excellent, making the 9mm an attractive choice for extended practice. Finally, there are excellent higher pressure (+P rated) loads available, producing excellent self-defense characteristics (make sure your handgun is rated to shoot +P loads before you use them).
.45 ACP uses heavier, wider bullets than the 9mm at somewhat lower velocity. The caliber lends itself to use with sound suppressors due to the fact that a standard round (230 grain) is subsonic under almost all circumstances. The permanent cavity (on ballistics gel) of a JHP .45 is about 40% larger than JHP 9mm. Recoil is more severe than the 9mm, and magazine capacity tends to be much lower. Most law enforcement officers will say (referring to a point-blank gun fight), that if you don't hit them in the first three bullets, you aren't going to hit them. So a large capacity magazines mean less than you might think..40 S&W is another common caliber with performance characteristics somewhere between the 9mm Para and .45 ACP. It has gained a large following in law enforcement agencies and elsewhere. Among other benefits of the round, the flat nose of the round has shown to create larger temporary cavities and also to allow the energy to transfer at a quicker rate create a sizable permanent cavity.
.38 Special, .357 Magnum, and .44 Magnum are common revolver cartridges. The 357SIG (a 9mm bullet in a necked-down .40 cal casing) and 10mm Auto are also somewhat prevalent autoloader calibers.
The 5.7x28mm is designed to defeat Class III body armor with appropriate ammunition. Such steel-tipped ammunition is not widely available to civilians, but the advantage of the round as a very low-recoil, high-velocity round cannot be denied., Knock-down power in a pistol caliber is a complete farce. Newton's law says, ""for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction"" meaning that if the bullet had enough force to knockdown your target, firing the bullet would have enough force to knock you down. All this to say, one bullet is not guaranteed to knock a person down better than the other; it is more of a matter of who you are shooting, where you are shooting them, and whether or not this person has it in their mind that they should fall down when shot. Shot placement is much more important than the bullet size or energy."
"
Use Jacketed hollow-point (JHP) bullets for self defense.,
Test out solid FMJ (Full Metal Jacket) bullets for better target penetration.,
Consider the weight of the bullet.,
Know that powder loads can change a bullet's ballistics and the gun's feel.,
Avoid shooting with the ammunition you intend to use for self-defense, as it can get expensive.",How to Choose the Right Pistol (Handgun)3," JHPs are almost universally considered the best choice for defense ammunition. Other expanding designs such as Federal EFMJ and Cor-Bon DPX are also considered effective. A trade-off with hollow-point rounds is that, when the round expands, it creates a larger permanent and temporary cavity. However, because of the faster energy transfer it reduces the penetration depth.



Soft-tip JHP is a vague description for any type of JHP which has a filling in the hole (it may be polymer or other hard material). This allows the bullet to pierce some objects or to travel through soft things (like clothes or flesh) for a period of time before opening up, allowing for deeper penetration. There are alternate names for such bullets, like ballistic-tip or V-Max. This is arguably the most versatile bullet. It will easily penetrate heavy clothing while retaining its ability to expand in a soft target.

, Solid FMJ bullets do not have the problem of losing their energy as quick and are known for penetrating through barriers and still piercing deep enough into flesh to arrive at vital organs. The permanent cavity is reduced in size (compared to JHPs), but there are trade off to every bullet. FMJs are often used for target practice.Federal Hydra-shok is a bullet which looks like a standard JHP from many angles, but inside the front cavity there is a ""spear"". This allows the bullet to open up and still pierce through some things. When it was first created this design led the industry, but most will say that improved standard JHP designs have since caught up.

Reverse-tapered hollow point is a unique kind of bullet. The hole in the bullet increases in diameter as it descends through the bullet. The design allows for some penetration through hard objects without opening. When the bullet does open it folds open into separate sections which are held together by the jacketing.

, In general, lighter bullets have higher velocities than heavier ones, so over shorter distances (less than 100 yards) lighter bullets have flatter trajectories. The problem with light bullets is that against soft targets they lose their energy with less resistance than heavier bullets. It has been proven that extremely light bullets can even be stopped by very heavy clothing.


A light 9mm bullet would be 100 grains. And a heavy bullet would be 147 grains (though 124/125 gr. is more common).
A light .40 would be 135 grains, and heavy .40 would be 180 grains.
A light .45 would be 165 grains. But a 230 grain would likely be better for almost any purpose in a .45; even heavier bullets such as 250 grain are also available., Standard loads are always recommended for most guns, but some guns like Glock and H&K specify the ability to fire hot loads. Most H&K pistols come with a dual-stage recoil spring which helps with felt recoil as well as recoil shock to internal components. This allows H&K to shoot +P (hot powder load) and +P+ (very hot powder load) without a problem. Other guns may need a spring replacement or other changes. The hotter loads allow for more muzzle energy and velocity as well as better reliability since the slide will be racked harder with the extra energy (less chance of limp-writing or stovepipes).

, You should fire many of your ""specialty"" rounds to make sure the firearm cycles reliably with them. Some pistols are picky about certain JHP bullet shapes. For general practice you can use FMJ to for cheap practice rounds, but consider using the same weight (grains) bullets and, if possible, the same load (Standard, +P, etc). This is because rapid-fire cycles can change drastically with different weight and loads.

Get night sights for any conceal carry or duty weapon that you plan on using after dark.,
Consider getting a tactical, attached light.,
Consider getting trigger work to fire rounds faster.,
Consider a new rubber grip for comfort.",How to Choose the Right Pistol (Handgun)4," It allows the user to sight up targets in low- or no-light situations. The problem with any night sights used in nearing dusk, or early morning, when there is not enough light to adequately illuminate the white rings, and it is too bright to see the tritium, at this point the sights are very difficult to accurately line up. But any darker (when most shootings take place) the night sights are very visible.

, Tactical, attached lights not only are able to light whole rooms, but can also give bad guys a short period of blindness if used on them. The problem is that they add weight to the gun, and can possibly throw off the balance. Some argue that they also give the bad guy a nice easy target to aim at (but honestly, just try looking at the light for a few seconds — they may know the direction to shoot, but they won't see what they are shooting at). Buying a cheaper light will almost guarantee it breaking after a while. For a duty or concealed weapon, this can be left off, but for home defense use, it may help identify your target before taking action.A separate hand-held light can do most of what an attached light can do.

, Often lightening the trigger pull, or shortening the length of the pull. This is great for target shooting or match shooting, but a trigger pull that is less than three pounds can quickly become unsafe if you are carrying the gun a lot. It can also help a lot with quick follow up shots, making them more accurate. This is a change that should only be made to the gun if the trigger pull is grossly heavy or long.

, For people with very large hands, this is a must to allow for a solid fit on the grip. The grips have problems though. They can move, affecting accuracy and requiring constant adjustment. Most tactical-style handguns have groves and hatches in the grip to allow a firm grip even with sweaty hands; the rubber makes the gun a bit slippery when sweaty. Additional maintenance is also required, as sweat and dirt will build up under the grip, which require the rubber to be taken off and the grip and rubber washed thoroughly."

Use a cleaning rod to tap the cartridge out of the chamber.",How to Clear a Cartridge Jam in a Handgun3,", This event can be caused by either a weak ejector tang, a dirty chamber, or a damaged shell casing. If sliding the action back doesn't dislodge the jammed round, you may be able to visually inspect the shell extractor, it is a small metal item that grips the edge of the round to remove it from the chamber. If the bend at the end doesn't look clean or is deformed, continuing without repairing it will not be advisable. If the extractor appears to be in good condition, continue reading.

, With the action locked open, use a metal pick, or a very small flat bladed screw driver, to pry the edge of the cartridge out of the chamber. Look closely at the chamber and cartridge for visual indications of why the cartridge jammed.

, If you are not able to pry out the cartridge, lock the gun's action open and run a cleaning rod down the barrel to push out the jammed cartridge.

",How to Clear a Cartridge Jam in a Handgun5," This can be caused by a few different issues, the most common being bullets of a shape that don't function well in a particular firearm, but clearing it is the same, regardless. If the pistol is ""jammed,"" that means the next cartridge has been stripped from the magazine, but didn't make it into the chamber in the proper way.

Look at the whole situation after clearing the jammed cartridge.,
Examine the bullets and gun to make sure they are all in good working order.",How to Clear a Cartridge Jam in a Handgun6," Is there an immediate need to continue firing, for instance, a self defense situation? If there is an urgent need to continue firing, then do so, but understand there may be risk involved.

, Use a pen light to examine the chamber, looking for fouling, rust, or other damage that could cause the cartridge case to hang up. Look at the shells to make sure they are the correct caliber and type for your firearm. There are numerous different 9mm cartridges available, like 9mm Luger, 9mm Parabellum, and .380 Auto. These are not interchangeable. If you cannot ascertain you have the correct ammo, do not reload and fire your weapon.

Understand your reasons for carrying a handgun.,
Decide whether you will open or concealed carry.,
Understand the tactical differences between a semi-automatic and a revolver.,
Select a caliber appropriate to your style.,
Consider your holster.",How to Choose a Handgun for Carrying," Carrying for protection verses carrying for deterrence will affect what type handgun to purchase and how you will carry it.;
, There is great debate on which is better and why. Educate yourself on your criteria and chose based on your preferences. Carrying a concealed handgun can limit your options to smaller framed pistols and revolvers if worn with particular clothing. Many people carry full-framed 1911's under a vest and that is still considered concealed carry. Some people believe that carrying openly can PREVENT a crime, rather than REACT to it.

, Semi-automatics can be reloaded quickly, assuming you carry an additional magazine. Revolvers tend to be lighter and smaller, but are limited in carrying capacity.

, There is not a wrong or right caliber. What is important is that you decide if the caliber you select can do the job you are requiring from it. the 9mm Para. has become one of the forefronts in the self-defense market due to it's economical price and the ballistics in short range environments. However, to hunt big game a .44 mag might be a better fit for knocking down a large animal..

, Choosing a holster for daily carry is different that choosing a hunting holster that you will only use once a year. There are many holsters that will do the job, but consider what you want from it. For long use throughout the day, everyday, a good quality leather or synthetic holster will perform better than the $5 bargain at the local yard sale. Very important for safety is that the trigger should be covered. Find a carry option that suits you. Remember that if the firearm is a hassle or uncomfortable to carry you are less likely to carry it. Remember that the best firearm in the fight is the one you remembered to bring with you.

Choose a good pistol.,
So from the generalities above, a large SA (or DA/SA) pistol with a long barrel would be best.,
While a public shooting range is a common place to practice, it is not necessarily the most optimal location to practice your long-range accuracy.,
Start your practice out with some stretches.,
Do some warm-up shots (maybe at 15 yards).,
When you first start shooting at long-distance targets, it is best to start closer and move your way up.,
Your stance should be what is most comfortable to you.,
Lean your head slightly to the right to line up your right eye with the sights of the gun.,
Slowly breathe, relax, and attempt to lineup the sights over the target.,
You will find with practice that your breathing and ability to not get excited and remain calm are the primarily challenges when keeping your sights on your target.,
The ""sight picture"" should, on traditional iron sights, resemble a shape like III, where the front sight is framed perfectly by the borders of the rear site.,
A gun should be 'zeroed' (adjusted) to aim accurately when the sight picture is placed directly below the target.,
Different ammunition shoots differently (and more or less accurately) for different guns.,
Novice shooters often pride themselves on a bulls-eye when the rest of their shots lie all over the target.,
Once you have the sights correctly aligned and have placed a perfect sight picture on your target, you want to slowly pull the trigger directly toward the back of the gun, with the trigger on or past the last joint on your index finger (pull straight, slowly, and consistently between shots).,
When the shot fires see where the bullet landed (high, low, left, right, or any combination).,
Practice at this range until you consistently are able to hit a chest-sized target (about a 20-inch diameter circle).,
If your sights hit in the correct location (not high or low) at 40 or 50 yards (36.6 or 45.7 m) (this is best), you will find that at 60 or 70 yards (54.9 or 64.0 m) you will need to compensate for bullet drop by aiming higher; it may only be a couple inches, but you will need to get used to it.",How to Become a Marksman (Snipe) With a Pistol," Though any pistol can be wielded better, the weapon can seriously limit the ultimate success of being a marksman with your pistol. Here are some generalities to look at when purchasing a weapon. The generalities deal with single-shot, long-range accuracy; this is not including considerations like self defense, durability, or price. None of these are concrete as there are exceptions to all of them, and a pistol that fits you personally is always the best choice.


Larger pistols are more accurate than smaller ones.
Larger pistols will fit more peoples' hands than smaller ones.
Longer barrels mean higher muzzle velocities which mean flatter bullet trajectories.
Lighter, high-velocity bullets are more accurate at common pistol ranges (out to 50+ yards).
Heavy bullets are more accurate at longer ranges (100+ yards).
Smaller calibers are cheaper to shoot, which means you can practice more.
Smaller calibers mean less recoil, which in turn mean faster follow-up shots, or more people can comfortably shoot it.
For semi-automatic pistols, double-action only (DAO) (AKA Quick Action) pistols are less accurate than double/single-action (DA/SA) or single-action (SA).
Expensive guns aren't necessarily accurate or shoot well often due to limits of the user.
Your gun is more accurate than you are.;
, Examples of such weapons are the H&K USP Elite, Desert Eagle 14-inch barrel, or target pistols by Hämmerli and other high-quality target gun makers. These are not cheap pistols by any means, but they are match-grade firearms and will serve you well.

, A friend with lots of land and a safe place to shoot is often best. This allows you to setup custom distances to targets and become adept at any range with any size target.

, This sounds really weird, but it will loosen your muscles and allow you to have more steady hands and body.

, Find where you (and your gun) are shooting. If you find yourself not able to keep consistent groupings at this range, practice shooting very slowly and being patient until your sights move over your target. Once you figure out where your sights are compared to where you are shooting (optimally, the bullet should end up in line with your front sight, but hopefully slightly above it – if you know how far off you are, a gunsmith can likely correct your sights) you can continue to the practice you came for.

, A good starting distance is about 25 yards (22.9 m). Though this is much further than most people are used to, if you are going to be good at long range, you must practice at long range. When you start you may find yourself unable to hit a body-sized target consistently, but over time you will find you can hit cans 90% of the time at this range.

, It is often best to (if you are right handed) to place your left foot forward, and about shoulder-length diagonally behind that, your right foot. Bring your right hand straight forward as if you are attempting to touch the target, keep your elbow loose, but close to lock; this is the hand that will hold the grip of the gun. Your left arm will be bent at about a 120 degree angle. Your right arm controls the vertical angle of the gun; your left arm controls the horizontal position. You left elbow should be about pointed directly at the ground.


Prone: You need to practice lying on the ground. Your stance on the ground should be such: lay on your belly. Then roll slightly to the firing side. Place your support knee and elbow down on the ground. You will be a bit sideways, but your firing arm will be completely flush with the ground with your head resting on it looking down the sights. This allows burden-free breathing and a very stable platform.
Crouching: This can give you a very stable platform for shooting accurately. Put your firing leg behind you and essentially sit down on the heel of your foot. Your firing knee will be on the ground and your toe. Rest your support elbow on your support knee. You are in a tripod position (support foot, firing toe and firing knee), and you are in an arrangement where you can move quickly (practice moving periodically to and from the crouching position).

, You may need to move your right wrist to adjust the sights to point forward. To aim, move your body (in this stance) until the gun lines up with the target.

, For target shooting, it is often best to overlay the front sight on your intended target, while focusing on the front sight, or somewhere in between the target and your front sight (this should only be used if you have ample time to aim). Do not focus on the target; focus near the front sight, concentrating all of your mind on creating a perfect ""sight picture"" where the rear sight and front site line up completely. The target should be a blur beyond your firearm. If speed is an issue: 99% of the time it would be best to focus completely on your front sight.

, This can only be overcome with practice. Breathe in and out normally before shooting, then take a slightly deeper breath before exhaling completely and relaxing your lungs. It is during this relaxation point (*not* forcing air out, just relaxing) that your shot should be taken.

, Keep in mind this means horizontal as well as vertical! This perfect picture should then be placed below the target (not obscuring it) and the gun should then be fired.

, It is in this manner that making artificial adjustments (e.g., aiming left or high) is avoided and a gun aimed straight and true to a perfectly aligned sight picture will deliver a round to the desired target accurately.

, Try various types for your firearm and determine which groups best for your gun.

, Even a handful of marbles thrown at the target will probably hit here and there; this doesn't demonstrate skill, only luck. Concentrate on grouping your shots close together; this is the first sign of an effective marksman and demonstrates consistency in shooting.

, With a DA/SA pistol, you should have already pulled the hammer back (it is now in SA mode). Based on the gun, you may have anywhere between a 2 and 8 lb pull. The lighter the trigger, the easier it is to be accurate (though with DAO pistols, there is a ""sweet spot"" that can be found to reduce the trigger pull; find it by firing a shot, without releasing the trigger; slowly move your finger forward until the trigger clicks, you can then pull the trigger again to fire).

, This may take some practice, but you will be able to determine if the shot missed because the sights aren't lined up, your arm was swaying and/or your timing was off, or you anticipated the shot.


When a shot lands left of the target for a right-handed person, it means they are squeezing the whole gun instead of just the trigger when they are firing.
When a shot lands right of the target for a right-handed person, it means they either have too much finger on the trigger or they are pushing in with their grip-fingers on the firing hand.
Shots very seldom land high, but when they do, it sometimes means the shooter is anticipating the recoil and pull up before a shot.
If a shot lands low, it is often because the shooter is either mashing the trigger (gripping the trigger and the gun, and pulling too quickly) or more likely because they are anticipating the recoil and thus pushing down on the gun before it actually fires.
Anticipating the recoil is one of the most common reasons a person cannot shoot a gun accurately. The person will expect the gun to recoil, so before the round has fired, they will move their wrist, pointing the gun down or up, depending on the shooter. A very easy way to identify this is by handing the person a gun they are very familiar with. Make sure it is unloaded, but tell them it is loaded. When they line up their shot, and pull the trigger, they will move the gun themselves.
To break this habit, here are a few techniques.

The simplest is to concentrate on your trigger pull. Point in to the target and slowly pull the trigger. Just keep building pressure as slowly and evenly as you can. It could take up to 10 seconds for the gun to fire. The purpose is to get a ""surprise break"" meaning that you don't know when the gun is going to fire, thus you can't compensate for it. A gun with a smooth trigger and a crisp break are more likely to prevent this situation as you are less likely to feel when the gun is going to fire as your pull the trigger.
The second technique is essentially the same, except it removes all possibility of the user anticipating the recoil. Point in to the target and keep your front sight on the target as best you can. Have a friend put their finger in the trigger guard and pull the trigger for you (either your finger on the index point, or on the trigger under their finger). Make sure the person actually doing the pulling does it very slowly and keeps their hand (mainly their thumb) away from the back of the gun (where the slide will clip them). This method is very awkward, but it will prove that trigger pull is one of the most important elements in firing a gun.
Many shooters, even experienced ones, flinch without realizing it. Anticipating the recoil can manifest itself as subtle movements that are masked by the actual recoil of the gun, and therefore go unnoticed by the shooter or observers. You can easily test this using a snap cap http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_cap. As stated in the link, “A snap cap is a device which appears similar to a standard firearm cartridge but contains no primer or projectile and is used to dry fire the weapon. Snap caps usually contain a spring-dampened false primer which absorbs the force from the firing pin allowing you to safely test-fire the gun without damaging the components.”
Have a friend load your gun for you, but replacing one loaded round with a snap cap of the same caliber, positioned in the magazine (for a pistol) or cylinder (for a revolver) at random. As you proceed to fire all rounds, you’ll eventually find the snap cap, but you won’t know it until after you’ve pulled the trigger. At that moment, it will be obvious to you – If your site picture is rock steady, you’ve mastered the weapon’s recoil. If the gun jumps in your hand like a live round just went off, you need more practice. This is a simple, inexpensive test, but the results may surprise you.



, Move the target back about 10 yards (9.1 m). Practice the cycle again. Maintain constant breathing patterns. If your sights are off, get new ones put on to compensate, or have a gunsmith fix the current ones. The 3-dot sight system is my preference, but some people prefer different style sights. Adjustable sights also make it easy to change the zero-point on your gun at any point.


After you move the target back a time or two more, you will find that you are able to practice and eventually be able to consistently hit that chest-sized target at further and further distances.
At some point, go back to the close target, and impress yourself at how well you are able to make tight groupings. This way you give yourself more confidence as you are able to see marked improvement.

,


At 100 yards (91.4 m) there is significant bullet drop (about 10-15 inches for a standard .45), and wind becomes a bit of a factor. While standing you may find you can go further than 100 yards (91.4 m). Push yourself and find your limit. While prone our crouching with a support, you will find you can land consistent shots out to 200 yards (182.9 m).

Terminal ballistic abilities at 200 or more yards for the most common pistol are questionable. At very long distances heavier bullets hold a greater percentage of their energy due to aerodynamic coefficients.

Not to say that there aren't some advantages to one round over another, and in a fight, the advantage should always be on your side.

Penetration is extremely important. If a bullet does not penetrate deep enough, vital organs and the nervous system are less likely to be damaged. In the late '90s the FBI conducted extensive studies which suggest a bullet should penetrate at least 14–16 inches (35.6–40.6 cm) to be reliable. This allows for bullets to enter a body at less than optimal angles and still have enough energy to reach vital organs or the spine.

Permanent cavity is the resulting ""void"" in a fleshy target where the majority of a bullet's energy was transferred and tissue was destroyed. The larger the permanent cavity, the greater the chance of vital organs or the central nervous system being damaged.

Recoil is something that is often not talked about in bullet ballistics because it is a very subjective and weapon-specific characteristic. Low recoil allows you to place more shots quicker and more accurately. Each person will have a different feel for the recoil of a bullet, and each handgun will transfer the recoil to the user in different ways.

Bullet energy is an over-emphasized feature of a round. In handguns, the energy of bullets is extremely low. ""Knock down power"" is a fable born of Hollywood action movies; stories of people being ""knocked down"" after being shot have been proven to happen because of a preconceived notion that when shot, you are supposed to fall down. People shot with a .22 LR in non-vital areas have fallen down because they assumed being shot is synonymous with falling down and possibly dying.
""Bullet energy"" is a rebuttal against people bragging about a bullet's energy without other considerations, but the amount of energy will also contribute to the first three points positively and negatively. The first three points on the other hand are all competing against each other in the search for a perfect bullet. If a low-recoil round with deep penetration and a massive permanent cavity were available, no other handgun bullet would be needed.

, Its relatively low recoil allows for quick, accurate follow up shots. The magazine capacity is usually much greater than other larger rounds. Cost is low and availability is excellent, making the 9mm an attractive choice for extended practice. Finally, there are excellent higher pressure (+P rated) loads available, producing excellent self-defense characteristics (make sure your handgun is rated to shoot +P loads before you use them).
.45 ACP uses heavier, wider bullets than the 9mm at somewhat lower velocity. The caliber lends itself to use with sound suppressors due to the fact that a standard round (230 grain) is subsonic under almost all circumstances. The permanent cavity (on ballistics gel) of a JHP .45 ACP is about 40% larger than a JHP 9mm. Recoil is more severe than the 9mm, and the magazine capacity tends to be much lower. Most law enforcement officers will say (referring to a point-blank gun fight), if you don't hit them in the first three bullets, you aren't going to hit them. So, large capacity magazines mean less than you may think.
.40 S&W is another common caliber with performance characteristics somewhere between the 9mm Luger and the .45 ACP. It has gained a large following in law enforcement agencies and elsewhere. Among other benefits of the round, the flat nose of the round has shown to create larger temporary cavities and also to allow the energy to transfer at a quicker rate to create a sizable permanent cavity.

, .38 Special, .357 Magnum, and .44 Magnum are common revolver cartridges. The 357 SIG (a 9mm bullet in a necked-down .40 cal casing) and 10mm Auto are also somewhat prevalent autoloader calibers. Another specialty round is the 5.7x28mm, made by FN, (Fabrique Nationale) designed to defeat Class III body armor with this ammunition. Such steel-core ammunition is not widely available to civilians, but the advantage of the round as a very low-recoil, high-velocity round cannot be denied. Additionally, due to its tumbling effect in soft targets it creates a considerable permanent cavity (for its size) while still penetrating deeper than 14 inches (35.6 cm). The 4.6x30mm, which has the same characteristics as the 5.7x28mm, is made by Heckler and Koch.

You should be able to load your gun quickly 100% of the time — without looking at your pistol, your hands, or your magazines.

,
Emergency reload is the reload in which you have spent all the rounds from your magazine and your slide is locked back.,
Tactical reload is the reload in which you encounter a lull in the gunfight and are able to place yourself behind cover.,
You should be practiced enough that when you are shooting (no matter how many rounds are in the magazine), you should be able to feel when the handgun is empty.",How to Combat Ready (Tactically Prepare) Yourself With a Pistol3,", This should all be done while keeping your gun pointed at your target. Psychologically, lowering your gun gives your intended target an advantage over you and keeps you focused on your gun rather than on your target.


The technique is as follows: when the slide locks back, you want to grab another magazine (likely from a magazine pouch). As you move the fresh magazine toward the gun, eject the empty magazine letting it hit the ground (they should essentially pass each other during the drill). Place the rear of the magazine against the rear of the magazine well of the gun, align the two, and with some force (though there should be little resistance) seat the magazine using the heel of your palm; then depress the slide release.

, You know you have spent some rounds from the current magazine and want to prepare for whatever may come next.


This drill can be done at the ready, since it should be done from behind cover and the other shooter (target) may be visible, but not an immediate threat. Reach to your magazine pouch (or other magazine holder — a pocket perhaps — and grab a magazine with your thumb, index finger, and middle finger. Move back to the gun and eject the partially depleted magazine into your hand, grabbing the ejected magazine with your ring finger, pinkie, and the palm of your hand. Insert the fresh magazine into the gun and tug on it slightly to make sure that it is seated in the magazine well correctly. (This is especially important when loading a magazine that is topped off.) This reload doesn't require manipulation of the slide release.
This reload should be executed before you re-holster your pistol so if you need to draw again you are fully prepared.

,


The slide has two separate actions every time a round is fired; after the last round is fired you will only feel the first action, ultimately there is less muzzle flip. The quicker you are able to reload the magazine, the better. After this, you execute an emergency reload.

Type-1 malfunction: this is a failure-to-fire (FTF) malfunction.,
Type-2 malfunction: a failure-to-eject is a common problem on older 1911s and other guns with shorter ejectors.,
Type-3 malfunction: this is known as ""the Mother Of All Malfunctions"" (MOAM) by some.,
Type-4 malfunction: this is pretty uncommon, and if it ever happens to you when you are practicing with your gun at the range, throw the gun away and get a different model!",How to Combat Ready (Tactically Prepare) Yourself With a Pistol4," You pull the trigger and you get a ""click"" instead of a ""boom."" This is the simplest type of malfunction, the most common type, and the easiest to fix: just tap, rack/flip.

, This type of malfunction is affectionately known as a ""stovepipe.""


The symptom of this malfunction is a ""dead trigger"" (no click, just a little bit of movement), and most likely some brass sticking out of your ejection port (but not necessarily), and the slide is not completely in battery (all the way forward). Fix it using the same method at a Type-1 malfunction: tap, rack/flip.

, This is a feed-way stoppage, which means that too much brass is in the chamber at the same time.


If you do get a type-3 malfunction under fire, many pistol masters will tell you just to grab for your back-up. Of course, if that is not an option you should find cover before executing the clearing.
To clear: grab your slide and lock it back (this is optional on many handguns). Press the magazine eject, grab the magazine and throw it to the ground (""strip"" it). Grab the slide again and rack it hard three times. Reach for a fresh magazine, put it in the gun (same as the tactical reload) and rack the slide one more time to load a round into the chamber. You can also learn to keep the magazine you have in your gun, read this.
Some pistols, notably the Glocks, may be cleared of a Type 3 malfunction simply by dropping the magazine far enough to allow the slide to go forward and then re-seating the magazine with authority. If the slide goes completely forward into battery, the pistol is then mostly likely ready to fire. If not perform the Type 1 clearing action.

, This malfunction is when the slide does not go back into battery after firing.


This might happen because your guide rod or guide rails are really gummed up (to the point where it looks as if there is a wad of Juicy Fruit in there), your guide spring is too weak or your chamber design is bad. Either way, modern semi-automatic pistols should never have this happen. A gunsmith (or you) may be able to diagnose the problem and fix it, but a gun that gets a Type-4 is not a reliable gun!(edit* The gun can be perfectly reliable and still have a Type 4 Malfunction. A good cleaning may fix the problem or your recoil spring is weakened and needs to be replaced. Optionally, as stated, take the firearm to a gunsmith.)

While point-shooting sounds like a great idea (to be able to naturally point at a target), it is (for 99% of people) a VERY bad idea.,
The other option is called ""flash sighting"".,
Studies in police departments which train with flash sighting against departments who teach point-shooting have shown staggering results.,
Most people can use that one-tenth of a second to get that guaranteed hit instead of just putting a bunch of holes in the walls behind the bad guy.,
Ultimately the ""point of the gun"" (mentioned in choosing a good sidearm) is still important as it will decrease the amount of time required to flash sight, but since the sights are still being used, it is less important.

",How to Combat Ready (Tactically Prepare) Yourself With a Pistol5," Past three or four yards, it may be impossible to get reliable hits on the center-mass of a target. And remember, the old adage, ""Think of the worst day at the range; you will be twice as bad as that in the middle of a gun fight!""

, This is done by pulling the gun up to the standard shooting position, focusing hard on the front of the gun and when the front post (sight) is somewhere in between the rear sights, the weapon is fired! It doesn't matter where; at three to seven yards even the worst flash sighting usually gets center-mass hits.

, The flash sighting police hit their targets four times as often as those who point-shoot. Average first shot times were less than one-tenth of a second slower (for those who flash sight).

, Flash sighting is something that needs to be rigorously trained for, otherwise, the shooter may return to point-shooting.

Dismantle the firearm safely.,
Identify the parts you are cleaning.",How to Maintain a Pistol (Handgun)2," On many modern designs, this is a relatively simple process. De-cock the hammer (or striker), pull the take down tabs. After a pull toward the rear of the frame, the slide should be able to move freely off the front of the handgun.


The actual process may vary greatly depending on the model of firearm you are field stripping.
Glock & Steyr users: Be triple-sure your firearm is unloaded as you must pull the trigger on the firearm to initiate the field stripping process.

, There are four major pieces to every semi-automatic handgun (though they may be attached in different ways).


Frame: this is the stock (or ""grip"") of the handgun. The trigger assembly is usually embedded in the frame, and the magazine well is located inside of the stock.
Slide: the piece of metal on top of the firearm; it keeps the chamber sealed, compensates for recoil (on many semi-autos), and houses the firing pin (and a few other components). If you have a polymer frame, this is where 70% (or more) of the gun's weight is.
Barrel: the barrel assembly is the barrel and the chamber. Be cautious with the muzzle-end of the barrel and the beginning of the rifling (inside the barrel), as these are the two most important things to affect accuracy and can easily affect it adversely, if damaged.
Guide rod and recoil spring: often these are one piece. The guide rod guides the slide as it recoils and the recoil spring pulls the slide back into place after a round is fired.

Wipe down all components using some cloth rags, but a lint-free wipe is not necessary.,
Apply solvent (preferably designed to be safe to continually contact your skin, like M-Pro 7) on all possibly dirty components.,
Let the solvent sit for a couple minutes.,
Scrub the whole gun with a brush (without metal bristles; use something like a toothbrush).,
Wipe the gun clean with lint-free cloth (you can buy pre-cut cloth, but a clean old cotton shirt or socks also work).,
Wipe down the whole gun (inside and out) with a solvent-soaked lint-free cloth again, and look again for any areas turning the cloth dark, and clean them.

,
Use the pick to get off any thick chunks of carbon or powder buildup, or buildup in tight parts of the gun.,
Use a bore brush to break any buildup free from the barrel.,
Swab the barrel with a cloth soaked with solvent.,
Oil all the components requiring lubrication.,
After a thorough cleaning, the next step in maintaining your firearm is to properly lubricate it.,
After oiling your firearm, a light grease should be used on its sliding parts.",How to Maintain a Pistol (Handgun)3,"


Remove as much as you can of the thick, caked-on carbon buildup created by the friction of use and burning powder. Also wipe off any old oil and all unburnt powder buildup.
Wipe the inside of the magazine well, the ejector, guide rails, and the area around the chamber. You will find certain areas turn the rags/patches black (clean these areas more).
On this step, precision is not required; wipe it quickly.

,


Most handgun manufacturers design components (even the polymer) to be safely used with any solvent, but be sure there aren't types of solvents the manufacturer warns against.
A liberal amount of solvent is not necessary.

, Make sure any area with dirt, carbon buildup, or unburnt powder has solvent on it, soaking in.

, This works in the solvent and loosens up the buildup on the gun. Try to get into all the nooks and crannies.

, Get everywhere you put the solvent (should be pretty much everywhere) and wipe it until it wipes clean.

,,


The most common area with carbon deposits is in the chamber. Buildup occurs in the corners of the pieces of metal.

,


Run the full length of the barrel at least five times (more if you have shot a lot since the last cleaning).
Be sure not to reverse direction with the brush in the barrel. Instead, push it all the way through, then all the way back (letting the bristles change direction outside of the barrel).

, Repeat with clean cloths (still soaked in solvent) until a cloth comes out clean. Then swab it with an oil-soaked cloth, this coat of oil will protect your barrel from oxidation (rusting).

, Often the manual for the gun will have specific areas needing oil, but a quick look at where the gun is wearing will give you a good indication of where to apply oil.

, Lubrication is as important, if not more so than cleaning. In order to keep your firearms from malfunctioning, proper lubrication is essential and proper oiling protects metal parts from corrosion. Lots of people use Rem Oil, but there are other more effective options out there. When deciding on what type of lubrication to use it is good to understand what you are trying to accomplish. The main goals are to prevent wear and corrosion. Knowing what conditions cause these help us in deciding what to use to keep our firearms running smoothly. Firearms produce high momentary forces when they they are fired. These high forces can often cause an oil layer between two parts to be squeezed out resulting in grinding which causes wear. To prevent this from happening companies add microscopic solids to oil that provide ""boundary protection"". Basically it is harder to squeeze out microscopic solids than it is to squeeze out a liquid. The products that provide this boundary protection are known as ""anti-wear"" or ""extreme pressure"" (AW/EP) additives, so look for them in firearm oils like Lubrikit FMO 350-AW oil. This oil is great at penetrating into tight spaces but is thick enough to stay where you put it and provides the necessary boundary protection.


A tip, When oiling a part, put on a layer covering the entire part just thick enough to leave a distinct fingerprint after you touch it.
Oil all the components requiring lubrication. Often the manual for the gun will have specific areas needing oil, but a quick look at where the gun is wearing will give you a good indication of where to apply oil.
Be sure to oil the areas around rotating parts, such as the base of a hammer or trigger assembly.
Try to keep oil away from the openings into the firing pin housing (oil is a collector of dirt and powder buildup, and buildup around your firing pin can prevent it from firing).

, The use of grease has been discussed frequently online but since it is a newer concept, many have not tried it. Acknowledged gunsmiths are recommending its use, especially on the frame rails of automatic pistols.


Grease is better on sliding parts since these types of parts tend to shed oil quickly. As the parts slide back and forth the oil is pushed out of the way leaving the metal exposed. Grease was designed to stay in place and good ones like Lubriplate SFL-0 keep sliding parts covered. The staying power of grease keeps the parts protected even after continuous use.
You want to make sure your grease has a base that is safe for the metals you are using them on. Grease bases like aluminum and lithium are best(chlorinated compounds are not acceptable).
Make sure the grease is thin enough so it won't inhibit the action of the weapon (usually NLGI #0 is best). Also look for good cold working characteristics, resistance to acids/alkalis and water (especially water), and preferably non-staining (black grease stains are not attractive on your shirt and pants).
Don't forget to grease the guide rails and the grooves in which they ride on the frame and slide.
Use a good anti-wear, anti-corrosion oil for general application and a light aluminum based grease on the sliding parts of your firearm and you will keep it running smoothly for generations.

Reassemble the pistol and make sure all parts are functioning properly.,
Wipe down the whole gun and remove any excess oil.

,
Swab the barrel with a dry cloth right before you intend to start shooting to remove any oil residue.

",How to Maintain a Pistol (Handgun)4,"


A quick test for proper functionality is to rack the slide; make sure it goes completely back into battery (all the way forward). If it does not, the recoil spring may not be set properly.
Ensure it is unloaded (see above), and pull the trigger, you should hear a click. Rack the slide again, or if the gun is a double-action, cock the hammer (or striker) again.

,, Form the leather to all major characteristics such as the ejection chamber, trigger guard, sight clearance tube and so on. This is where you can add your own personal touch by adding as much or as little detail as you would like. If you would like to add fine lines to mimic your handgun select a smaller rounded object to add the lines. However, the majority of the retention of the weapon in the holster is achieved by depressing the leather into the trigger guard from both sides as well as the ejection chamber. As the leather begins to harden make sure that it reaches a sufficient firmness to retain your handgun when turned upside down and shaken gently. Re-submerge in the boiling water if needed.

, Leave the handgun in the holster overnight.

Position yourself about 7-yards (the distance the FBI determined a man could move in a second and a half — about the time it takes to draw a pistol and fire) away from a large (10+ inch) target.,
The next stage is to put bursts into the target.,
Practice with multiple targets.,
Practice while moving.,
Integrate the Mozambique Drill.",How to Combat Ready (Tactically Prepare) Yourself With a Pistol6," In a lowered gun stance (ready position), pull your gun up, as quickly as possible, to firing position and focus hard on the front sight of your gun, wait until you see a bit of the front sight between the rear sights and pull the trigger (this is the flash sighting technique). You should be able to land a hit in the 10-inch target every time. If you are missing, try going a little slower. The key is to practice procedure, and the speed will eventually improve naturally.

, Take a few steps back (go for 10 yards). Do the same routine as before, but this time, put two or three shots quickly into your target, between each shot, get the flash sight again. Once you are able to get to firing position and put three quick shots into your 10+ inch target consistently in under a second-and-a-half, you can move on.

, You want to start by setting up three or more targets a yard or two apart. Quickly, go to the firing position and go down the line. One shot at each target. Change it up: maybe try in a different order; have a friend tell you which one to shoot (""one!"", ""three!"", etc.), but the key thing to be sure of is that you hit your target; once you are sure you can hit your target every time, try to accelerate your pace. At first when you fire, move the gun with the recoil. As soon as the recoil is completed you should be on the next target already. As you get faster you can force the gun into position and be ready before the recoil is complete.

, While moving, you should still be able to hit targets at 10 yards (9.1 m). Set up three or more targets a few yards apart from each other. Start about 15–18 yards (13.7–16.5 m) back. Run up to about 10 yards (9.1 m) from your first target while drawing your gun into the firing position. Fire a two-round burst, side-step to engage the next target, and so on. Each time you run the course, try to do it faster. Try to pause as little as possible when shooting (even while moving you should be able to get a flash sight), the longer you pause the more accurate you will be, but in a gun fight, the clock is always ticking quicker than at the range.

, If a friend is calling out target numbers, and they call the number of a target you have already shot, this time you go for a head shot. This is also known as ""failure to stop"" practice. The idea is you have shot the target, but he isn't impressed (i.e., he is on drugs, is wearing body armor, or is just plain determined) and keeps coming, so you have to take a head shot. Read Human Targets below for more information.

"
"
Bullet placement is much more important than the bullet itself.,
The thoracic cavity is the ""center of mass"" in a human.,
The second major area is the cranial cavity.,
For practice, replacing the circular chest target with a dome-shaped 11x7-inch target and the head with a 3x5-inch target will get you a more realistic targeting area.",How to Combat Ready (Tactically Prepare) Yourself With a Pistol7," There are two critical areas of a human which contain major organs and vital systems which, if shot, can stop a man in his tracks or kill him.

, This area contains the heart, major veins and arteries, the trachea, bronchi and lungs, the esophagus, and structures of the nervous system including the paired vagus nerves. To imagine the area that this encompasses, it starts above the diaphragm (just below the sternum) and makes (from a frontal view) a dome shape up to the first lateral rib. This is a pretty large target area. A shot in one area of the thoracic cavity is little different from any other, unless you hit the heart.


The problem with shots in the thoracic cavity is that a determined fighter or a man on drugs will be less than impressed with anything you throw at him in this area. Even if you destroy a person's heart they still have 20 to 30 seconds of full cognitive and physical ability with which they could severely hurt or even kill you. Additionally, the heart is a very small target and completely destroying the heart with one bullet is nearly impossible, which means that they will likely have even more time before their eventual fate is achieved. For all these reasons, many have adopted the self-defense rule: ""shoot until the threat ends."" (Or as stated in The Rules of Combat: ""When in doubt, empty the magazine."") But you must determine for yourself what your protocol will be.
Body armor is also a factor. Just hitting a man in the chest (unless you hit him in the exact same place every time) is just going to deplete your magazine. (Your chest delivered bullet thump MAY induce a fibrillation, resulting in death, but it has to be timed perfectly with your target's heart beat. Not an advisable procedure. Nor is it reliable.)

Bullet penetration is very much a key factor in bullet selection. This penetration does a few things for you. At less than optimal angles, the bullet will still reach vitals, and it will give your bullet a chance to possibly hit the spine, which (depending on where it lands) can either incapacitate completely, or at least paralyze enough of the body, so you may be able to get away. An important factor to note is that while bullet penetration can be to your advantage, rounds with a high degree of penetration (e.g., the FN 5.7x28 round) can exit the target. When firing with rounds like these, beware of accidentally hitting people or objects behind your assailant. Position yourself to your advantage, and wait for a clear shot. Once it leaves the barrel, the bullet will hit something, and you can't call it back!

, This area is much simpler; it contains the brain and upper spine.


While the brain is an obvious target, there are still some considerations in shot placement. The front of the cranium (above the eyebrows) is one of the hardest bones in the body, it is also not a flat target (angled toward the top of the head, and toward the sides). There have been instances where bullets have ricocheted off a person's forehead.
Incidentally, just below this bone (below the eyebrows), down to the top of the upper-jaw is a very soft area with nose cartilage, sinus cavities, and eye holes, which leads directly to the lower brain, the medulla oblongata, and the upper spine. The brain is the largest target, and a bullet in there will mean ""lights out,"" but flinching and minor movements are also possible when the brain is shot. The medulla oblongata and the upper spine initiate those flinching signals that are sent to the body. A bullet through either one of those, should ensure that there is no way the body might accidentally pull a trigger or move in some other potentially detrimental way.
In a situation which requires the immediate and unquestioned incapacitation of a person, a shot through an approximately 3-inch (above the upper-jaw to eyebrows) by 5-inch (the outside edges of the eyes) window in the head is essential. This 3x5-inch area is about the same no matter what angle the person is facing you (from the rear and the sides it is about the same size and about the same level on the head).

, When scoring (to compare your improvements), or competing, a shot breaking the line of either cavity is good. The size of the grouping should matter less than getting the hits in quickly; and when shooting at the cranial cavity, only a guaranteed shot should be taken (you should always take more time for a cranial shot than a thoracic shot). But keep in mind, ""Remember your worst day at the range; you will be twice as bad when you are in a gun fight."" So, a hand-sized grouping in the thoracic region is optimal, as a general rule.

For the budget conscious hunter, an outstanding deer rifle for not a lot of money is the Mosin Nagant.",How to Choose a Rifle,"

If you are brand new to shooting, and just want a rifle to learn with, a light caliber is recommended. .22 caliber is cheap, easy to come by and is probably the best choice for informal shooting and learning the basics of firearms. Several other small calibers exists, but none can match the commonality and price of the .22 LR (.22 Long Rifle).
Due to the low power of the .22 caliber round, many companies offer simple and not too expensive rifles in this caliber. Brno makes excellent bolt action rifles, Marlin, Henry, and others make good lever action rifles, and Ruger makes an excellent semi-auto rifle in this caliber (the Ruger 10/22). All of these are user friendly, easy to field strip. The Ruger is also modular with aftermarket parts. Whatever rifle you choose, make sure you know all the relevant features, particularly safety features, before use.;
, An easy rifle to use will be fun to shoot. The only real way to get proficient with rifles is to shoot a lot. A fun rifle will therefor be the better option. If you plan to buy a rifle in a larger caliber later on, the type of operation can be important. If you plan to use a bolt action hunting rifle later, choose a bolt action and so on.

Hunting rifles come in many calibers. There is an old saying from colonial days that "".30 is a squirrel gun, .40 is a rabbit gun, .50 is a deer gun and .60 is a bear gun."" Of course, weapons have become a lot more powerful since then, so that formula doesn’t really apply. But on a similar format, here is a good standard for today. A .22 is a squirrel gun, .22 magnum is a rabbit gun, .30 or 7.62 is a deer gun and .300 magnum is a bear gun. Larger rifles are not recommended for beginners (or even experienced shooters except in special circumstances). Rifles do however come in calibers up to .600 Nitro Express, suited for elephant (and costing you as much as a house)






Good guns for survival type situations are military rifles with semi-auto or (where legal) full auto mechanisms. A good place to start is the AR-15 type rifle. It is very user friendly, and very accurate, but it tends to be unreliable when irregularly maintained. The .223 cartridge it fires can have too much over-penetration for too little stopping power. They also tend to be expensive. Another choice is the AK-47 or derivatives. It is much cheaper, it's 7.62x39 mm cartridge packs more punch, and it is much more reliable even in nasty conditions. But it is much less accurate, and many of the features are difficult to manipulate when compared to the AR-15 series, most notably the safety and magazine release. A very important aspect to consider in a survival rifle is ammunition availability.






Rifles are by their nature not ideally suited for self defense. They are long and cumbersome, and most of the calibers offered in rifles are excessively powerful and will tend to penetrate walls and potentially kill innocent bystanders. For an urban setting or other situations where you anticipate a lot of potential for collateral damage, some great choices are the Beretta Cx4 Storm chambered for 9mm and the FN P90 chambered for 5.7x28 mm. Both of these are good choices, as they are very short and easy to handle indoors, and the rounds are much less powerful, and when using hollow point or frangible ammo, they will most likely not go through walls.






Another thing to keep in mind is that it is becoming frighteningly common for criminals to wear bullet proof armor. For people living in inner city areas or in trouble with the Russian mafia, a good rifle of choice will be the M-14. It is very accurate, semi-automatic, fires from removable magazines, and its 7.62x51 mm cartridge will easily punch through Kevlar armor and in some cases, even ceramic ballistic plates. In the USA, this rifle is not considered an assault rifle, so it is California Legal.







,


Hunting rifles typically come in larger calibers, usually around .30 (7.62 mm). Most rifle makers offer rifles in this range, and used rifles are easy to come by for the budget buyer. If you buy a used rifle, make sure the paper-work is in order and take the gun to a gunsmith to make sure it is in good working order before using it! Cartridges in the .30 caliber range hold enough powder to endanger a shooter in case of a barrel obstruction or broken locking lugs.


, This was the Russian service rifle during WW2, and they are extremely common in gun and knife shows. It is a bolt action rifle that fires the 7.62x54R cartridge from a 5 round fixed magazine. And as of May 2009, they can usually be acquired for $100 or under, plus tax. Ammunition for it is also extremely affordable, and can be brought in bulk on the Internet for an even better deal.


As for the budget conscious personal defense rifle, that title definitely goes to the SKS 7.62x39 rifle. It is cheap, going for around $300 before taxes if bought used. It is extremely accurate. It can be modified to use a detachable magazine, but does not usually come with that feature, instead firing from a fixed 10 round magazine loaded by hand or from stripper clips. It is very reliable, even in bad conditions. And it is very easy to maintain. And like the M-14, it is not technically an assault rifle in the USA.

Consider the primary reason you shoot your rifle.,
Think about how much magnification you really need.,
Choose fixed scopes for cost-effectiveness, and variability for greater range.,
Consider your usual environmental conditions and check how solid the scope feels.,
Read the Objective Lens Diameter (OLD) to determine how much light the lens lets in.,
Look for a higher eye-relief in quality scopes.,
Know that parallax correction knob is a feature meant to add consistency and regularity to your shots.",How to Choose a Rifle Scope1," Are you hitting targets, hunting, or simply keeping the weapon for self-defense? If you shoot at targets, how far away do you normally shoot from? The primary thing to think about now is distance -- how far do you actually need to see to hit your common targets?



Self-Defense: Unless you're defending a large parcel of land, a scope will likely slow you down and get in the way for self-defense.

Target Shooting: Is your range 100 yards, or are you shooting long distances?

Hunting: Think about where you hunt and what you hunt. Small game hunters in New England won't need zoom above 10x, as thick trees are likely to make it useless, but those hunting big game out west may require a bit further vision.;
, When sold, scopes come with two numbers, often something like ""3-9x40."" Scopes come with a range of magnifications, depending on your range. The numbers to the left of the ""x"" represent how much bigger the target will look than to the naked eye-- so ""3x"" will make the target appear three times as big in the scope. While the following magnifications are guidelines, they can help you as you start shopping.


For carbines, a reflex sight or 3.5x-9x magnification telescopic scope should work well. These are often strong enough for most recreational hunters or basic target shooters.
Anything below 10x is best for off-hand shooting and following targets.
For full-scale rifles, 12x-20x magnification telescopic scopes may be necessary. They are made for big, open spaces and long shots. They will be expensive. Anything above 10x generally requires a supported position, such as prone or bench shooting.There is no real benefit to paying for higher magnification just to have it. In fact, zooming in 20x to hunt whitetail deer is overkill that often leads to missed shots and wasted ammo., Know that you'll pay more for high-range variable scopes. A variable scope is one you can adjust, like the 3.5-9x mentioned above -- you can adjust the zoom anywhere from 3.5 times normal size to nine times normal size. Of course, the greater this range, the more versatile your actual scope will be. This, of course, comes with a much higher price tag. In general, it is best to get a smaller, more specialized scope, but spend money on higher construction. Really ask yourself how often you'll need to shoot something at 20x zoom? Unless you're hunting huge game out west, this is almost always overkill.A classic, fixed 4x scope is common on many basic hunting rifles. Simple, effective, and cheap, it will work in a variety of mid-range scenarios.
If you know you're doing open, long-range shooting, a high-powered fixed scope, something from 24x, 36x, or even 40x power, might be the most cost-effective solution., Your scope, at the very least, needs to be fog-proof, otherwise you'll be severely limited in your conditions. While this is generally standard, not all scopes are designed to hold up in extreme heats, moisture, humidity. If you hunt in a variety of conditions or live in extreme winter/summer environments, spend the extra money for high-end weather-proofing.Feel the scope, checking for solid construction. There shouldn't be wiggling or looseness., The number after your zoom length is usually the objective lens diameter, or the size of the glass at the far end of the scope, and this determines the diameter of the ""main tube,"" which is the body of the scope. It is usually 30 millimeters or 1 inch (2.5 cm), but there are other options too.


The objective zoom diameter is noted by the number after the ""x"", so a 3-9x40 scope would have a diameter of 40 millimeters.With zooms over 10x, especially higher zooms, you may want to move up to 50mm OLD.
Larger objective zoom diameters allow more light into the scope as well, helping see the shot better. Note, however, that higher magnification lowers available light.

, Eye relief determines how far back from the scope your head can be to see everything, and is crucial to help prevent ""scope eye,"" when the recoil of the gun knocks the scope into your face. The higher the recoil on your gun, the more useful a higher eye-relief will be.The most common eye relief for rifles is around four inches. However, there are scopes for pistols and bigger guns that go up to 16–20 inches (40.6–50.8 cm), sacrificing some field of view vision in return.
Always test the scope how you most frequently shoot it. If you shoot with a bench rest, test the eye relief on a bench rest., Some smaller scopes are ""parallax free,"" but you should know what to do if your scope is not. On scopes with parallax, your cross-hairs actually move slightly when you move your head, making short-range scoping maddeningly difficult. A parallax knob helps with ""adjustable objectives."" Basically, it is a knob on the scope helping you dial in distance. For example, if you're shooting a 200 meter away target, set the adjustable objective to 200 yards. Now, your scope will be calibrated to give you the best shot at this distance.


For big game hunting, the movement of your breath and heartbeat is greater than any movement caused by parallax.
For smaller shots and target shooting, parallax is near industry standard."

Glock and other Constant Double Action (DAO) pistols (such as QA Walthers, LEM, and DKA triggers) have a trigger which has a reset-point after the gun has been fired.,
Most other pistols (single-action—SA, double-action—DA, double/single-action—DA/SA) are a bit more standard.,
After you develop a good trigger-pull skill, the next thing to practice (at close range — 4-8 yards), is shooting the gun as fast as possible.,
Gun works like this: bullet is fired, slide racks back, shell gets ejected.,
If you pull the trigger before the gun is at rest in your hands, you will shoot higher than the first bullet.,
With some practice, you will find you can do 10–12 inch (25.4–30.5 cm) groupings at 7 yards (6.4 m).",How to Combat Ready (Tactically Prepare) Yourself With a Pistol9," Fire a round at your target; now, slowly release the trigger until you hear a click, and resistance on the trigger is lessened. At this point you can pull the trigger again. This not only allows you to be more accurate while doing single-shots (due to the shorter trigger pull), but when you get your finger used to the motion, it is the best way to shoot the gun quickly., You have to release the trigger completely before it can be pulled again. SA and DA/SA will be easiest for this drill, as they will have lighter trigger pulls than their DA (or DAO) counterparts., The faster you can pull the trigger, the more options it leaves for you., As the slide moves forward, the rest of the gun (frame, barrel, etc.) rises (this is called muzzle flip), as soon as the slide is back in battery (full-forward), the gun can fire again. But, the gun is ready to fire before it has gone back to its resting position in your hands., If you wait too long, the gun will actually bounce below the original position, and firing during that stage will cause the bullet to land low. You can either wait a bit longer (but that removes the word ""rapid"" from this drill), or, you can time the firing to when the gun is falling past the rest position.

You can also increase the cycle speed of the gun in your hands by getting a tighter/firmer grip on the gun (this will be too firm for accurate single-shot shooting). If you do this, timing is more important, but it allows you to shoot faster.
Note that each gun, and each caliber, will have totally different cycle times. Therefore, practice with a few handguns, to round out your skills. If you get the timing wrong, you will find that hitting a target consistently, even at 5 yards (4.6 m), can become difficult.
If your bullets are hitting high after the first shot, try shooting a bit more slowly. Or, try tightening your grip on the gun. If you are shooting low, either shoot faster or loosen your grip on the gun.

, Once you are able to do that, or get close to that, you can add other drills: that is, setup two or more targets. Fire four or five rounds at one target, then turn to the next target and so on. This combines one of the earlier-mentioned shooting drills and the rapid fire drill."
"
Prone: You need to practice lying on the ground.,
Crouching: This can give you a very stable platform for shooting accurately.,
Cover and Concealment: Hiding behind cover in a gun fight seems like a smart idea, but don't think you are invincible behind most materials.",How to Combat Ready (Tactically Prepare) Yourself With a Pistol10," You will find that lining up your sights will be quite different and rapid fire becomes difficult to control. Your stance on the ground should be such: lie on your stomach. Then roll slightly to the firing side. Place your support knee and elbow down on the ground. You will be a bit sideways, but your firing arm will be completely flush with the ground with your head resting on it looking down the sights. This allows burden-free breathing and a very stable platform., Put your firing leg behind you and essentially sit down on the heel of your foot. Your firing-side knee and your toe will be on the ground. Rest your support elbow on your support knee. You are in a tripod position (support foot, firing toe and firing knee), and you are in an arrangement where you can move quickly (practice moving periodically to and from the crouching position)., There is a big difference between ""cover"" and ""concealment."" Objects like car doors and walls may only serve to keep you hidden from your opponent's view (concealment), but in most cases bullets can punch through these objects. It is better to look for something that can stop bullets, as well as hide your whereabouts (cover). An engine block will completely stop most types of bullets. Shooting from behind cover should be done while exposing as little of your body as possible. If the cover allows it, do not expose your body from the same side constantly. Variety is not only the spice of life, it can sometimes save it, by making you unpredictable in a gun fight."
"
This drill can be added prior to any other drill.,
Most semi-automatic pistols will not fire if the slide on the gun is not in battery (full-forward) position.,
Charging a bad guy seems like a stupid idea in most cases, but if the bad guy is reloading, or otherwise distracted, it can be of great benefit (you may be able to catch him by surprise or disarm him).",How to Combat Ready (Tactically Prepare) Yourself With a Pistol11," It is designed to get your heart rate up, and maybe some adrenaline going, which will give you a mild tunnel-vision effect. Before you do a drill, with your firearm securely holstered, do 20 or more push ups. Go until you have a bit of a burn and you are getting out of breath. Jump up and do your drill as soon after as possible. You will find that accurate aiming is much more difficult, though general flash sight aiming shouldn't be too much different; this is why it is so important to get familiar with this action., This becomes a problem if your pistol is resting against something, or the front of the gun is pressed into something soft. A simple drill to keep the bad guy off your gun in a close quarter situation, is to put your support arm straight in front of your chest, bent at a 90-degree angle. This keeps the bad guy off you, while your firing arm is lowered near your hip. Practice with a tall target that you can lean your arm up against and fire into. (Make sure the target is soft, so the bullets don't ricochet, and it doesn't splinter — make sure you shoot straight forward, so you don't hit your arm.) A couple times is all you need with this drill, just to give you the feel., Have a center-chest-sized target (10+ inches) set up 15–20 yards (13.7–18.3 m) away. Start your sprint at it, and when you feel you are close enough to hit the target while moving, slow down to a crouched walk with your knees slightly bent (to keep your upper body smooth) and shoot the target.

Add different things while running: have a friend tell you when to start shooting (at random times). Or start running at the same time a friend starts reloading. Have the friend yell when he is done to let you know to start shooting. It can become a reloading vs. sprinting contest. (This will also give you an idea of how long a reload takes if you need to rush someone.)
If your location allows, stand 15–20 yards (13.7–18.3 m) away from your target. Have another person stand well off to the side pointing at a different target. The person standing to the side will have one round in the chamber and an empty magazine, with a loaded magazine within easy access (e.g., a magazine pouch). You should have your gun out and at the ready. The other person will fire; you start running at your target. When you are close enough to get good hits, you shoot; if the other person is able to reload and fire at his target before you shoot, he wins. It is best (for safety reasons) for the other person to be aimed and shooting at a target which is in a different direction than yours, so at no time will one person be in front of someone else's muzzle.
Additionally, you can try reloading while running at the target, then shoot the target when you are done (this is the most advanced version of this drill).

"
First of all, knock-down power in a pistol caliber is a complete myth if not a farce.,
Newton's third law of motion says, ""for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction,"" meaning that if the bullet had enough force to knockdown your target, firing the bullet would have enough force to knock you down.,
All of this is to say, one bullet is not guaranteed to knock a person down better than another; it is more a matter of whom you are shooting, where you are shooting them, and whether or not this person has it in their mind that they should fall down when shot.",How to Combat Ready (Tactically Prepare) Yourself With a Pistol12," Information can be found on the Internet, indicating that ""here are twenty accounts of X caliber bullet getting a one-shot knock down."" The question is, how many shootings were waded through or disregarded to get these accounts? There are documented instances where a man shot with a .22LR in a non-vital area fell down and eventually died., If you don't believe this, do some research on the Internet, since there are many people doing objective testing of knockdown power., Shot placement is much more important than the bullet size or energy. On the other side, the correct bullet choice may give you the edge, which is needed for you to survive the fight."
"
Choose the reticle that looks the most comfortable to you.,
Compare the two key adjustment systems.,
Know that you get what you pay for with light transmission.,
Think about the coating system on the scope.",How to Choose a Rifle Scope2," There are tons of different reticles (the crosshairs you look through on the scope) out there, each with subtle enhancements meant to teach you more about your target on the fly. While many of them have benefits, they are only as useful as the shooter who uses them. If you understand the uses and functions of a reticle, then you're likely informed enough to use it well. If you're new or unsure, just stick to the classic ""duplex"" reticle -- the basic plus sign markers -- or the one you feel most comfortable looking through.Mil-dots: A dotted crosshair that lets you estimate the target's distance, so long as you know how big the object is.

BDC: Stands for ""Bullet Drop Compensator. It has a set or horizontal lines on the lower half of the crosshairs, helping you adjust for distance at great distances., Very few scopes come working right out of the bag. They need to be adjusted, and you'll need to keep adjusting them as you shoot potentially. There are two systems, each with their differences, illustrated below. If this seems too complicated, talk to the sales staff about your shooting history to find the right system for you.



MOA: Roughly, 1 MOA will correspond to 1 inch when shooting at 100 yards. So, if you miss by 1 inch, you can simply adjust with 1 click. Typically has smaller adjustments, leading to more precise zeroing. They are the most common for a variety of shooters. However, much harder to adjust when at distances not 100 yards.

MRAD: A little more complicated, 1 MRAD is roughly 3.6 inches (9.1 cm) at 100 yards. However, you can adjust right to the scope -- if you miss by one MRAD, simply adjust the scope by one MRAD. Favored by long-range shooters, but often bulky and expensive.You should also think of where these knobs are -- if you're hunting in the brush and moving around a lot, will they get banged up and twisted accidentally? Many companies make low-profile knobs to avoid this., This is key -- how much light does the scope let in so you can see your shot. Super high-end scopes offer higher light transmission, but with significantly higher costs. Theoretically, the highest a scope can go is 98%, but very few make it past 95%. Most are around 90%. While important, you should ask yourself if spending an extra $500 is worth it for an extra percentage point.


Note, the longer-range the shot, the more helpful high light transmission will be., Coatings provide you fog-proofing and waterproofing, and significantly affect cost. While coatings vary wildly, you should use the following guide to help you cut through the marketing baloney and know what you're buying. In order of effectiveness, and cost, with the weakest, cheapest scope first, includes:



Coated: Simply means that a least one lens surface has at least one layer coating it.

Fully Coated: A single coating layer covers all air-to-glass surfaces.

Multicoated: Multiple layers on at least one surface.

Fully Multi-coated: Multiple layers on all air-to-glass surfaces.

Hydrophilic and hydrophobic coatings are meant to shed water from the glass on you lens."
"
Feeding Above all, the first consideration should be, ""Does this bullet feed reliably in my chosen firearm?"",
Jacketed hollow-point (JHP) bullets are almost universally considered the best choice for defense ammunition.,
Solid FMJ bullets do not have the problem of losing their energy as quick and are known for penetrating through barriers and still piercing deep enough into flesh to arrive at vital organs.,
Bullet weight is another thing to consider.,
Powder loads can change a bullet's ballistics and the gun's feel.,
Practicing with the ammunition you intend to use for self defense can get expensive.",How to Combat Ready (Tactically Prepare) Yourself With a Pistol13," Some firearms ""prefer"" a certain shape or length. That being said, quality sidearms will generally feed almost everything well. Just test everything out before the worst-case scenario happens., Other expanding designs such as Federal EFMJ and Cor-Bon DPX are also considered effective. It has been proven that JHP and other expanding rounds at handgun velocity are unreliable (at best); and more to the point, that 50% of the time, subsonic rounds are less likely to expand properly in a target. Another controversy with hollow-point rounds is that when the round expands, it creates a larger permanent and temporary cavity, but because of the faster energy transfer, it reduces the penetration depth., The permanent cavity is reduced in size (compared to JHPs), but this again proves that there are trade offs to every bullet.


Federal Hydra-shok is a bullet which looks like a standard JHP from many angles, but inside the front cavity there is a ""spear."" This allows the bullet to open up and still penetrate through some things. When it was first created, this design led the industry, but now, most will say that improved standard JHP designs have since caught up.

Reverse-tapered hollow point is a unique kind of bullet. The hole in the bullet increases in diameter as it descends through the bullet. The design allows for some penetration through hard objects without opening. When the bullet does open, it expands into separate sections which are held together by the jacketing.

Soft-tip JHP is a very vague description for any type of JHP which has a filling in the hole (it may be polymer or other hard material). This allows the bullet to pierce some objects or to travel through soft material (such as clothes or flesh) for a short distance before opening up, which allows for deeper penetration. There are alternate names for such bullets, like ballistic-tip or V-Max. This is arguably the most versatile bullet. It will easily penetrate heavy clothing while retaining its ability to expand in a soft target.

, In general, lighter bullets have higher velocities than heavier ones, so over shorter distances (less than 100 yards) lighter bullets have flatter trajectories. The problem with light bullets is that against soft targets they lose their energy with less resistance than heavier bullets. It has been proven that extremely light bullets can even be stopped by very heavy clothing. A general rule is during the summer, any bullet will work, but light is nice for ballistic reasons; during the winter, when people are wearing heavy clothes, greater mass bullets are superior.

An example of a light 9mm bullet would be 100 grains. And a heavy bullet would be 147 grains (though 124/125 gr. is more common).
A light .40 would be 135 grains, and a heavy .40 would be 180 grains.
A light .45 would be 165 grains, whereas a 230 grain would likely be better for almost any purpose in a .45; even heavier bullets such as the 250 grain are also available.

, Standard loads are always recommended for most guns, but some guns, such as Glock and Heckler & Koch (H&K), specify the ability to fire hot loads. Most H&K pistols come with a dual-stage recoil spring which helps with felt recoil as well as recoil shock to internal components. This allows H&K to shoot +P (a hot powder load) and +P+ (a very hot powder load) without a problem. Other guns may need a spring replacement or other changes. The hotter loads allow for more muzzle energy and velocity as well as better reliability since the slide will be racked harder with the extra energy (less chance of limp-wristing or stovepipes)., You should fire many of your ""specialty"" rounds to make sure the firearm cycles reliably with them. Some pistols are picky about certain JHP bullet shapes. For general practice you can use FMJ to keep it cheap, but consider using the same weight (in grains) bullets and, if possible, the same load (Standard, +P, etc.) because rapid-fire cycles can change drastically with different weights and loads."
"
Night sights are a welcome addition to any conceal carry or duty weapon.,
Tactical, attached lights not only allow one to light up whole rooms, but they can also inflict temporary blindness on the bad guys if used on them.,
Trigger work is another tempting modification that many people do to their pistols, often lightening the trigger pull, or shortening the length of the pull.,
Rubber slip-on grips can make a sidearm more comfortable.",How to Combat Ready (Tactically Prepare) Yourself With a Pistol14," It allows the user to sight up targets in low- or no-light situations. The problem with any night sight occurs when used around dusk, or in the pre-dawn, early morning time, when there is not enough light to adequately illuminate the white rings, and it is too bright to see the tritium. Under those conditions, the sights are very difficult to accurately line up. But when it's darker (when most shootings take place) the night sights are very visible and useful., The problem is that they add weight to the gun, and can possibly throw it off balance. It makes the weapon bulkier and harder to conceal also.

A very serious problem with attached lights is that it requires the user to aim the gun at the bad guy in order to see him, which from a legal standpoint ""assaults"" him, and gives the bad guy the legal right to shoot YOU! This problem can be completely avoided by using a separate, hand-held tactical light, which can do most of what an attached light can do, although it will make two-handed shooting much more difficult if not impossible.
Also, some argue that attached lights give the bad guy a nice easy target to aim at (but honestly, just try looking at the light for a few seconds — they may know in what direction to shoot, but they won't see what they are shooting at).
Buying a cheap light will almost guarantee it breaking after a short while. For a duty or concealed weapon, this can be omitted, but for home defense use, it may be a very good thing to have so that the target is always identified before taking irreversible action.

, This is great for target shooting or match shooting, but a trigger pull that is less than three pounds can quickly become unsafe if the gun is carried a great deal or often. It can also help substantially with quick follow-up shots, making them more accurate. This is a change that should only be made to the gun if the trigger pull is exceptionally heavy or long., This is often a good thing, and for people with very large hands, it is a must to allow for a solid fit on the grip. The grips have problems though. They can occasionally move, and this can affect accuracy and require constant adjustment. Most tactical-style handguns have groves and hatches in the grip to allow a firm grip even with sweaty palms; and sometimes, the rubber makes the gun a bit slippery when wet. Additional maintenance is also required, as sweat and dirt will build up under the grip, which then requires the rubber to be taken off and the gun's grip and rubber cleaned thoroughly. With large hands, or for a gun which has a very uncomfortable grip, try using rubber grips."

Allow the epoxy to cure.,
Disassemble the rifle.,
Remove the compound from the stock’s pillar holes with a drill.,
Remove the modeling clay and rinse off the release agent.,
Reassemble the rifle.",How to Bed a Rifle Stock," Contact the manufacturer of your rifle. Work with a company representative to determine the type of action you require. Place an order for your rifle’s action and wait for it to arrive.The action is the part of the rifle that loads, fires, and ejects the cartridge.;
, Before bedding your rifle—coating the stock’s interior with an epoxy resin—complete a dry run. Make sure all of the pieces fit together properly before applying the bedding material. Insert the action, followed by the trigger, magazine box, bolt, and bolt release. To ensure that the action feeds correctly, place dummy shells into the magazine.Do not force the pieces to fit together properly. If the action or another piece does not sit correctly in the gun, contact the manufacturer and order a new part.

, If you are unfamiliar with the rifle, consider documenting the assembled firearm. Use a camera or your phone to take pictures of the assembled rifle. Documenting the assembled gun will provide you with a reference source., Take the action out of the stock. Remove the rifle’s small parts. These include the magazine and trigger. Examine the existing bedding job. Note where the epoxy was placed and how the stock was bedded.If the bedding is still in good condition, you can use the same method.
If the bedding is cracked, excessively worn, or softened, look into alternative bedding methods.

, Place newspapers on top of your flat work space. Retrieve your vise grips and set them on your work space. Insert the stock between the loosened vise grips and tighten.Vise grips will secure the stock in place and prevent the stock from rotating.
If you do not have vise grips, use a gun holder instead.

, Degreasing the action will allow other materials to adhere to the gun. Put on a pair of latex gloves. Dip a cotton ball or swab into denatured alcohol. Use the saturated cotton ball to wipe down the action and recoil lug., Placing tape over and around the recoil lug creates a small gap, which ensures the easy release of the action from the stock. Wrap the top, bottom, and sides of the recoil lug with two layers of masking tape. Cover the front and back of the recoil lug with two layers of masking tape., Put on rubber gloves before coating the action and barrel with a release agent. Be sure to coat the action screws, foot plate, and every part that will be reinserted into the stock. Allow the release agent to dry. There are several release agents on the market.Use an aerosol spray to liberally cover the barrel and action.When using a wax, dip your fingertips into the wax. Spread the wax over the action and barrel with your fingers.
Err on the side of caution—cover everything with release agent.

, To prevent the epoxy from seeping into places it shouldn’t cover, fill the action’s nooks and crannies with modeling clay. Use a popsicle stick or your fingers to fill the holes and a razor blade to remove excess clay. Don’t forget the screw holes!, Apply a second coat of the release agent to the rifle’s metal parts. Dip a cotton ball or swab into denatured alcohol. Use the saturated cotton ball to wipe down the inside of the stock., Retrieve a non-waxed plastic cup and a popsicle stick. Use the popsicle stick to place equal parts resin and hardener into the plastic cup. Add dye to the mixture so that it matches the color of the stock. Use the stick to stir the mixture until it is a peanut-butter like consistency.To avoid air bubbles, do not whip the mixture.Always follow the instructions on the product!
Apply the mixture with a popsicle stick. Put on disposable rubber gloves. Place a dime sized amount of the mixture onto the end of a popsicle stick. Use the stick to coat the recoil lug area and the rear screw area with a thin, even layer of the mixture.Use the previous bedding job as a guide. Apply the mixture on top of the previous bedding.

, Place the action into the stock. Retrieve a screwdriver. Insert the action screws into the action.


If the action has two screws, tighten the rear screw first.
If the action has three screws, tighten the screw directly behind the magazine first., Remove the vise from the stock. Insert the rifle’s barrel into the vise. This will reduce the stress on the stock., Once the action is screwed into the stock, epoxy seep through the seams. Wipe off any excess epoxy with a cotton swab. Go over the surface with a razor blade to scrape off any remaining residue., The mixture must properly set before you can clean the stock and action. On average, you should allow the epoxy to cure for 24 to 48 hours.Always follow the curing instructions for a product.

, After allowing the compound to cure, you must take the rifle apart. Unscrew the screws from the action. Tap the action with a mallet to “pop” the action out of the stock. Observe the stock—you should see an exact replica of the action.To remove a stubborn screw, insert the screwdriver and tap on top of the handle with a rubber mallet.
If you are struggling to remove the action, insert a ⅝ inch dowel into the back of the receiver. The dowel will function as a lever. Press down on the lever to evenly distribute pressure to remove the action., It is essential that you remove dried compound from the stock’s pillar holes. Insert a 5/16 inch bit into your electric drill. Remove the compound by drilling into the sealed hole.Since most screws used in rifles are ¼ inch, a 5/16 inch bit should work most of the time.

, Use a razor or knife blade to loosen and remove the modeling clay. Check to make sure all of the clay is removed from all pin and screw holes.Run a rag saturated in hot water over the parts to remove the release agent—the release agent should peel off., Retrieve the pictures of the assembled rifle. Reassemble the rifle so that it matches the pictures and tighten the screws. Wait one week to use the firearm to allow the compound to finish curing.


At this point you may torque the screws.

Identify what you are looking at.When looking at two different scopes you must first manage to identify them.,
Find out what your eye relief is.,
Find out what the reticle is.,
Compare adjustment turrets.,
Look at the quality of the build of the scope.",How to Compare Rifle Scopes," Most rifle scopes have a marking composed of two or more numbers, separated by an X. The first is the magnification of the scope, and the second is the diameter of the objective(in millimeters).


For example a 4x28 scope has 4x magnification and and objective lens of 28 mm in diameter. Some scopes have a varying magnification, or zoom.These are marked as 4-12x30 for example. This means that the scope can magnify from 4 to 12 times. Magnification is important, depending on the type of rifle that you are going to mount it on.
For example a .22 or air rifle will not need more than 4x, while a high-powered rifle will shoot at greater distances, therefore needing a higher magnification. .For hunting a varying magnification scope is better, as your targets will be at varying distances. The lens diameter is important for luminosity. The wider the objective, the more light will enter the scope and the better you will see the target.;
, Eye relief is the distance the maximum distance your eye can be from the ocular (the lens closest to the shooter) and still see the full image through the scope. For .22 rifles and air rifles a small eye relief is okay, but for safety reasons (getting hit by the scope because of the recoil) high powered rifles is necessary at least a 3–4 inch (7.6–10.2 cm) eye relief, depending on the recoil of the particular gun. Specialty rifles for scout sniper rifles or handguns need very long eye relief(around 20 inches or so).

, Reticle is the name used for the crosshairs you can see through the scope. They come in many styles such as fine crosshair ( thin cross), mildot ( cross with dots along the lines), or rangefinder. Both mildot reticles and rangefinder reticles can be used on estimating distances. A mildot or rangefinder is a welcome help, as distance to target is paramount to shot placement, especially in .22 and air rifles, where the ballistic properties of the projectile cause it to have a very curved trajectory even at relatively short ranges. Reticles can be illuminated some in different amplitudes, and colors. While red is the color that affects the shooters vision less in dark conditions, a green reticle is best for dusk or dawn situation as red light is less visible in that period of the day.

, Adjustments turrets for elevation and windage are usually found on most modern scopes. A scope that has adjustment turrets with ""clicks"" is better as it allows for more precise adjustments.

, A very important aspect that can differentiate scope is quality build. The lenses are primordial to good sight picture. Lens quality usually depends on manufacturer, as does tube material (steel or aluminum are best, but also modern plastics and polymers can do a good job) and general craftsmanship. Usually you can estimate these characteristics (by examining finish, image clarity and functionality) but usually for safety is best to consult reviews.

Develop your steady position.In the Army, soldiers who pass basic marksmanship are expected to hold their rifle steady enough to keep the front sighting post straight even if a hammer falls on the barrel.,
Steady the handgrip with your non-firing hand.,
Put the rifle butt firmly in the pocket of your firing shoulder.,
Grip the pistol grip with your firing hand.,
Keep your elbows down and in.,
Relax your neck and let your cheek fall naturally to the stock.,
Relax your body.,
Check your natural point of aim.,
Align the rifle sight.,
Focus your eye.,
Check your sight picture.,
Control your breathing.Shooting is a skill of millimeters, and you'll notice how much your breath affects your aim as you train your sights.,
Squeeze the trigger.,
Follow through.,
Fire from a prone position.,
Shoot from a seated position.,
Shoot from the standing position with your feet shoulder width apart.,
Fire while kneeling.",How to Aim a Rifle," By mastering these fundamentals of basic steadying technique, you should be able to hold your sights that steady in any position.


Practice different positions to find what works best and is most comfortable for you. The seated position, comfortable for some, is uncomfortable for shooters with bad hips.
If you're right-handed, your ""firing hand"" will be your right hand and your ""non-firing hand"" will be your left hand, and vice versa.
However, eye dominance also plays a factor. Generally, with shoulder-fired weapons, you line up on the side of the dominant eye. This is even true for cross-dominant shooters — people who are left or right handed and dominant in the opposite eye.;
, The rifle's hand guard should rest in the ""V"" created by your thumb and forefingers. The grip should be light, like a bad handshake, and the wrist should be straight with the fingers curled naturally around the handguard.


The non-firing hand should keep the rifle steady as the non-shooting hand in basketball should steady the ball. Most of the support of the rifle should come from your firing hand and your position, but the non-firing hand is for steadiness.
Take precaution to always keep this hand clear of the rifle's action and ejected shells.

, Make sure the butt is steadied against your shoulder, not the fleshy part of your armpit beneath it, or on your collarbone.


Keeping it firmly in this pocket allows the recoil to be absorbed by your whole body, rather than snapping back into your shoulder, making for a painful and inaccurate shot.

, Depending on the kind of rifle you're firing, you'll be gripping either a full pistol grip or a tapered shotgun-style grip. Regardless, your grip on it should be more firm than your non-firing hand, more like a business handshake. There should be some backward pull on the grip, pulling the rifle back firmly into your shoulder. This ensures that, when you're ready to fire, squeezing the trigger won't move the rifle and jostle your accuracy.


Your trigger finger should be straight. Do not curl it around the trigger until you're ready to fire. Rest it on the side of the trigger guard, or use it with the other fingers to grip the stock.

, Your elbows will be placed somewhat differently depending on whether you're seated, standing, or prone, but all positions require that your elbows stay under the rifle to support its weight. Imagine a string connected your elbows toward your hips, pulling them in toward your center of gravity.

, This is sometimes called ""cheek to stock weld,"" and can be obtained by bringing your nose to the charging handle on some rifles. Consistent cheek-to-stock weld will ensure that your eye aligns naturally to the sight and that you don't have to use your peripheral vision to strain and aim.








, With proper technique, you should be able to relax your body and assume a calm breathing rhythm. Your grip should be firm on the rifle without being tense. If you're using your muscles to hold the rifle, eventually they'll tire and your accuracy will waver. Getting into a comfortable, relaxed position is the best way to shoot accurately.

, Having oriented yourself in the general direction of the target and relaxed in a steady position, your rifle should be oriented mostly on-target without much more effort on your part. This is called your ""natural point of aim"" and is a sign of proper technique.


If, when you relax your muscles in your steady position and let your cheek weld to the stock, you have to expend effort to twist your body around even slightly to get the sight directly on target, this is a sign you need to reposition yourself. Abandon your position and realign yourself properly.

, A basic aperture-sighted rifle (i.e., there's no scope on the rifle) – often called ""iron sights"" – consists of two parts, a front sight post or ""bead"" near the tip of the rifle's barrel and an aperture or ""crook"" about halfway up the barrel. Before you worry about your target, you need to align the bead in the crook to ensure that the rifle is ""sighted."" Any error here in alignment multiplies exponentially when the bullet leaves the gun.


If you've got good cheek-to-stock weld, the sighting post should align in the aperture without much difficulty. Reposition your neck slightly if you need to.
If you're using a telescopic sight, the principle will be essentially the same.Make sure that your eye is the proper distance back from the scope, far enough to avoid recoil and aligned properly so there are no ""shadows"" in the scope's vision.
Make sure your scope is properly sighted before firing and that your front sight post is blackened and matte, not reflective. Use gun blacking or pencil lead to blacken.

, Align your eye with and focus on the front sight post. When you're trying to balance your elbows on your knees and breathe evenly and keep the stock tight and keep a little bead in a little aperture on a tiny target 50 yards (45.7 m) away, it can get frustrating: What do you even focus on? The short answer is the bead, not the target. Trust that you're in the right position, relax, and focus on the bead.


If you're in proper position and you've aligned the sight, your target should be in the aperture, and though it will appear blurry to you, focusing on the bead ensures that you maintain proper sight alignment while firing, resulting in a more accurate shot picture.

, A correctly aimed shot has the front sight post, the aperture, the target, and your eye aligned perfectly (or if using a scope, the crosshairs and the target). This is called a ""sight picture."" Take a second to shift your focus back and forth between the target and your sight, ensuring that everything is aligned.


Eventually, the more you practice your aim, you'll be able to do this without changing your focus, which tends to strain the eyes. Practicing cheek-to-stock weld and sight alignment will ensure that your eye doesn't have to work too hard when aiming.

, But it's important to breathe naturally and fully. Holding your breath will cause discomfort and inaccurate shots. In your breathing, learn to notice the moment immediately following an exhale, when you've completely emptied your lungs of air, but before you become uncomfortable and need to take a breath. It's a split-second, but it's the steadiest and most perfect moment to squeeze the trigger.

, All of your careful alignment and positioning will be undone if you yank on the trigger like a gear shift. Instead, you want to squeeze the trigger as if you were bringing your finger to your fist, completing the firm business handshake you've got on the grip with a gentle squeeze.


Early on, anticipating the report and recoil of the rifle causes many shooters to wobble when pulling the trigger. It's a lot to keep straight at once, but getting comfortable your rifle is the only way to shoot accurately. Take lots of time setting up your shots and learn to relax. That groundwork will pay off.

, Just like in basketball or golf, the proper positioning and balance needs to continue all the way through the shot. Jerking your head up to see whether you hit the target is the best way to miss it. Keep your muscles relaxed, your cheek welded to the stock, the butt tight to your shoulder pocket, and keep your eye focused on the front sight post. Take a few breaths and you're ready to either check your shot or fire again.

, Make a line with your non-firing leg and elbow that points about 25 - 30 degrees to the right of your target. Shoulder the rifle in the crook of your firing shoulder so your natural point of aim falls on your target. Keep the butt high enough in the shoulder so your head stays upright as if you were standing. Use your left hand to bring the rifle up to the target level.


The prone position is the most stable of all standard firing positions because the shooter's elbows and the weight of the rifle are supported by the ground. You can also use a bipod, sandbag, or other steadying device in this position.
Be careful of your hot shell casings. Since you're prone, hot spent casings can roll against your skin or fall onto your body, but this applies to shooting from any position.

, In this position, you'll sit cross-legged, oriented 90 degrees toward to the target. Rest your elbows on each knee to support the rifle stock, keeping your back as straight as possible to improve your accuracy.


This position is very comfortable for some shooters, but is effected significantly by breathing. Maintain good breath control when firing in this position.

, Keep your non-firing hip pointed at the target. You want to distribute the weight of the rifle over both feet evenly to ensure the most accurate shot, so keep your elbows down, your weight balanced on your hips.


Securely support the rifle by forming straight column of support with your body. The rifle should balance comfortably atop your body, requiring only minimal muscle use from you.

, Professional shooters use something called a ""kneeling roll"" to brace the ankle of the firing-side leg, but you can also use a rolled up t-shirt or other brace. Kneel over your brace, keeping your bracing ankle on the firing side straight and the non-firing knee vertical. You can rest the non-firing elbow on your non-firing knee, or use the kneeling position as a modified standing position and keep it up. Either way, keep your elbows and in and down, supporting the weight of the rifle.


If you do rest your elbow on your knee, make sure you avoid unstable ""bone-to-bone"" contact. Instead brace the ""meat"" of your arm against your knee. Try placing your knee against your left tricep an inch or two above your elbow, then making minor adjustments to find the stablest, most comfortable position for you.

Choose the right rock.,
Wash the rock.,
Shape the rock.,
Rub the stone of rough grade sandpaper.,
Use fine grade sandpaper to remove scratches.,
Sand with 300 to 600 grade sandpaper.,
Rub the stone with a piece of leather with polish.",How to Polish Rocks1," You can polish any stone you wish, but there are certain characteristics of a stone that will make it easier to polish. If you want an easy stone to polish, pick a somewhat softer stone like onyx, limestone or calcite. Stones that are very hard will take a much longer time to polish. However, though hard rocks take a long time to sand, they yield more shine than softer rocks.To tell if a stone is soft, scratch it with another rock. If the scratch looks chalky, the stone is soft.
Also try to pick a rock with a roundish shape, without major protrusions or indentations.;
, If your rock is dirty, wash it thoroughly with soap and water. Use a scrub brush to remove any stubborn dirt or debris. After you are done washing the rock, pat it dry.







, If you want your rock to be rounder, use a small hammer or a chisel to chip away at the stone. Put on safety glasses to protect your eyes from chipped off rock, and wear safety gloves if you wish. Chip at any outcroppings or sections that jut out.If you are happy with the shape of your rock, don’t worry about shaping it.
You can also rub the stone over a slab of concrete to break off any protrusions.

, 50 grade is the roughest grade of sandpaper, and is great for further shaping your rock. Use the sandpaper on any protrusions or bumps in the rock you want to smooth. If you are happy with the overall shape of the rock, give the rock an even sanding with the 50 grade sandpaper to smooth it evenly.







, Take the stone and rub it with the 150 grade sandpaper. You may notice that the coarse 50 grade sandpaper left scratches in the rock; go over these scratches with the 150 grade sandpaper to smooth and erase these scratches.








, Do an overall sanding of the rock with sandpaper in a grade from 300 to 600. Focus particularly on any scratches in the rock. This grade of sandpaper is fine and won’t create scratches, but it can correct any scratches left by the sandpaper in other grades., After you are done sanding your rock, polish it using leather and tube polish. Purchase a tube of polish and a sheet of leather from a hardware store if you don’t already have them around the house. Then put a couple dabs of polish on the leather and rub the stone against it. This should give the stone a beautiful, lustrous shine.








Make sure not to buy colored polish, or it may stain the stone.

Buy a rock tumbler and grit.,
Select and sort your rocks.,
Fill the tumbler ½ - ¾ full of rocks.,
Run the tumbler with course grit.,
Take the rocks out of the tumbler.,
Run the tumbler with medium grit.,
Tumble with fine grit.,
Clean the rocks and the tumbler.,
Do a final polish.",How to Polish Rocks2," Rock tumblers are great for rock polishing because they give the rock a more defined shine than hand-polishing, and they can polish dozens of rocks at once. You can buy rock tumblers online from specialty sites or Amazon. Keep in mind that pricing of rock tumblers varies dramatically, so buy one in accordance with your needs. Also purchase grit designed for rock polishing in coarse (80 grit), medium (220 grit) and fine (400 grit) grinds.


A cheap, plastic tumbler is a good option if you only want to use it a few times. Spring for a more expensive tumbler if you can see rock polishing as a new hobby.

, Before you start polishing your rocks, sort them so that the rocks you put into the tumbler are of similar hardness and surface shape.You don’t want to put rocks of different hardness in the tumbler because the harder rocks will wear down and scratch the softer rocks. You also don’t want to put in differently shaped rocks, with some being jagged while others round, because the rounder rocks will get polished faster than the irregular rocks.
Try to put in rocks of various sizes. This will help the rocks achieve a more uniform shaping.

, First, wash your rocks with soap and water. Once washed, drop the rocks of similar hardness and shape into the tumbler. Then take the rocks out of the tumbler and weigh them. After weighing them, put them back in the tumbler.

, Measure out .1 pound of grit for every pound of rocks in the tumbler. Then pour water into the tumbler until it reaches the bottom of the top layer of rocks. Seal the lid of the tumbler and turn it on. Run the tumbler for 24 hours and then open it to check on the progress of the rocks. Then put the lid back on and start the tumbler again. Tumble the rocks for 3 to 7 days, checking every 24 hours to make sure that everything is going smoothly.
The coarse grit is meant to smooth out the shape of the rocks. For rounder rocks, it should only take about 3 days to get a nice shape. For more jagged rocks, it may take about 7 to even the surface out.
Checking every 24 hours lets you see the progress of the rocks. After checking, you may decide that either they are ready for the next step, or that you want to keep tumbling them for another day.

, After 3-7 days, take the rocks out of the tumbler and place them in a pan. Clean the grit off of the rocks and clean the inside of the tumbler. Don't wash the grit down the sink because it will solidify and clog your drain. Instead, throw it in the garbage.Thoroughly wash your rocks and the tumbler until they are spotless. Having even small amounts of coarse grit left over can disrupt the next part of the process.

, Place the clean rocks back in the tumbler. Put in the same amount of medium grit as you did coarse grit. Then fill the tumbler with water until the water reaches the bottom of the top layer of rocks. Seal the lid on the tumbler and turn it on. Run the tumbler for four or five days, checking every 24 hours.


After four or five days, stop the machine and open it up. Place the rocks in a container and clean out the grit.
Again, make sure that the rocks and the container are completely clean, and throw out the grit instead of flushing it away., Place the clean rocks back into the tumbler. Put in the same amount of fine grit as you did coarse and medium. Pour in water until it touches the bottom of the top layer of rocks. Then put on the lid and start the tumbling process. This cycle should take about 7 days. Check every 24 hours to check the progress.This is the last stage of using grit, so don’t cut the cycle short until you are happy with the smoothness and shininess of the rocks. You may need to clean a rock off to see the shine when you’re checking in on the progress of the rocks.

, Thoroughly clean the rocks and the tumbler. Make sure that you have removed all the grit from the nooks and crannies of the tumbler, as this can affect its future performance. When you remove the grit from your rocks, you'll see that they are brilliant and shiny!, Sometimes soft rocks don’t get the brilliance you need just by tumbling. To add a finishing touch to rocks that need more shine, use leather and polish. Dab a bit of polish onto a sheet of leather, then rub the rock against it, making sure to use the polish on the entire surface. This gives the rock the brilliance that you want!"

Binocular and periscope Mil Dots are not the same as rifle scope Mil Dots.,
A Mil is 1-6,175 of a circle.,
When looking at Mil Dots through a scope, one Mil is the distance from the center of one dot, to the center of the next dot (not the space between the dots).,Mil distances on rear-plane cross hairs on a variable-power scope usually are only accurate at the highest power.",How to Calculate Distances With a Mil Dot Rifle Scope1," They measure the same type of angular distance, but is actually 10 Mils instead of only one, which is more suited for marksmen use.;
, But to simplify calculations, the U.S. military calculates them as 1-6283 of a circle (previously 1-6400 on older scopes). Russian-based scopes are set to 1-6,000 of a circle. This means there is up to a 3% error in distance calculations., Each dot is .2mil and the space between the dots is .8mil for the round army type mil dot reticle.

,"
"
Calculate the distance to the object by multiplying the height (or width) of the object by 1000 then dividing by the number of Mils that the object spans.,
Calculate as accurately as possible, and any ""added error"" (by yourself) is error in distance that may not be acceptable.,
Use a calculator if needed.",How to Calculate Distances With a Mil Dot Rifle Scope2,"


For example: a six foot tall object (2-yards) which is eight Mils in size is 250-yards away. 2 x 1000 / 8 = 250.







,

Sub-divide the Mil Dots as much as possible, and be as accurate in estimating the size of the object as possible.






The object is five feet (1.67-yards) wide and spans 2.8 Mils is 596-yards away.






A guess that the object is 2-yards instead of 1.67 would mean the estimation of over 100 yards difference which could mean a hit, or a miss of over five inches with a standard .308.






To be in the right mindset, calculate sizes of objects to the tenth of a yard (is that 3.4-yards or 3.5?). Calculate the span in Mils also to the tenth of a Mil. Both of these will take practice, but perfect estimations is the only way to get perfect range calculation.

, Some equations might get pretty complex, and accuracy is key, but the speed of a calculator may also help in some situations.

Prepare grass.,
Process yucca.,
Use nettles.",How to Make Rope," Rope can be made from a large number of materials, many of which you may have lying around the house, yard, or campsite. Depending on what you have available to you, you can make rope from:


Plant fibers like grass, hemp, flax, straw, bark, nettles, yucca, and any other fibrous or vine-like plant.Twine, string, thread, or even dental floss.
Plastic bags or paper, shredded into strips.;
, Your thread could be a blade of grass, or a piece of string, or a strip of bark, depending on what you're making rope from. Make sure that all the threads are roughly the same length and thickness. For a thicker rope, you will need more threads; for a thinner rope, start with about six pieces of thread.


If you are working with a material like string, where you are cutting lengths, remember that your rope will get shorter as you twist it together.
With materials like grass and other plant fibers, you can easily splice in more lengths of thread later to make your rope longer.

, Lay your threads together so they are all lined up, and tie a knot at one end to keep them secured together. Then, divide the bunch into two even sections.


Once you divide the sections, the bundle will be in a V-shape that’s attached at the knot.

, Grab one section in each hand and begin tightly and evenly twisting all the threads in the same direction.It doesn’t matter if you go clockwise or counter-clockwise, as long as it’s always the same direction.As you continue twisting, the two strands will begin to wrap around one another, forming a rope.

, For ropes made of plant fibers or grasses, it’s especially easy to splice in more lengths of fiber to create a longer rope.


As you near the end of your first bundle, grab two more sections of thread that are the same thickness as the original two.
Overlap the tails of the original thread sections with the heads of the new sections, making sure the tops of the heads actually extend beyond the tails, so that the new threads are anchored into place.
Continue twisting. Eventually, the twisting will wrap the new and the old sections together, giving you an additional length of rope.

, When you have finished twisting your threads together and have a rope of a suitable length, tie another knot in the end to prevent the rope from unraveling.If you are working with nylon or something similar, you can also burn the ends to melt them together and keep them from coming apart.

, Especially with grasses and plant fibers, trim off any excess that’s sticking out from the rope, particularly where splices occurred.


To make an even stronger rope, repeat this process, and then twist those two ropes together using the same method to make an even thicker rope., The reverse wrap is another way to twist the threads of your rope together, but this method is otherwise very similar to the basic twist process, and begins with the same material choosing and gathering.

, Just like before, you want your threads tied together into a single bundle and then divided into two sections that are joined at the knot.

, To do the reverse wrap, hold the top of the threads (near the knot) in your non-dominant hand. With your dominant hand, grab the section that’s farthest away from you.


Twist the section away from you once. Then, bring it over top of the other section back toward you, grabbing it with your non-dominant hand and securing it in place (as though you were braiding with only two sections).Grab the new section in your dominant hand, and repeat the twisting and wrapping process.

, Alternate between the two sections all the way to the end of your threads, twisting away from you and then crossing the sections, securing the cord in place with your non-dominant hand as you go. When you reach the end, knot the ends to secure the rope together.

, Ideally, you want tall, hardy grasses for a stronger rope, and the taller the grass, the less splicing you’ll have to do to make longer rope. Collect the grass and divide it into two piles. Flip one pile around so the roots are at the opposite end, and lay it down on top of the other pile so that half the tips are at one end and half the tips are at the other end.


You turn the grass in opposite directions so that there is thicker grass stalk distributed evenly throughout the rope.Once you’ve made your pile, grab either a thick or thin handful of grass, depending on the diameter you want your rope to be. Tie a knot in one end and proceed with your rope making.

, To turn yucca leaves into fiber for threads, cut the leaf from the base of the plant, and snip off the pointy tip. Lay the leaf on a flat surface and gently beat it with a stick or rock. As you beat the leaf, the fiber from the plant will begin to separate. Work your way up the entire length of the leaf until all the fiber separates., Find nettles that are tall and dry. Cut down a few and let them dry out over the course of a couple days. Then, use a rock or stick to press against the stalks and open them up. As the stalks open up, begin peeling off strips of green fiber from the stalk’s woody interior. Set the strips aside, and when you are finished you can use them for rope.This method will also work for other woody plants that are tough but break open easily.

Have a space prepared.,
Purchase the equipment.,
Stand back and watch the magic.

",How to Plan a Playground," You need at least a 20' x 20' space. This is to support the normal swingset/monkey bar combo with a slide. To add more equipment means you will need more space. To make your ground surface accessible by all children, plan to utilize a re-purposed rubber surface. If you wish to go more traditional, use either wood chips, sand or pea gravel.;
, The type of equipment you wish to have on site will be entirely up to you. Some of the more modern offerings and entirely traditional offerings are:


A shade. Now, more than ever, industrial playground builders are becoming creative in the wake of more exposure to the sun. A large shade can be used in place of mature trees, if no trees can be found.
A set of swings. A typical swingset will include at least 1 traditional swing and perhaps an identical one next to it or a modified horse swing where potentially 2 people can sit and push while pulling and make the swing 'go.' Alternatively, a baby swing can be placed next to the traditional swing or, more recently, a handicapped swing, with full-buckling ability can be used. An industrial set can include up to four or five swings. You can alter their heights to allow for shorter legs vs. longer legged pre-teens.
Climbing things. Rock walls have become welcome additions to swingsets, allowing children more options. A rock-wall pattern can even be used in a more personal swing set, to allow for children's climbing up to a slide area.
Towers. A tower area gives rise to the imagination, as well as an appropriate height for both slides and zip lines and dual towers allows for the plank walkways that make those satisfying rumbles as well as a little bounce in your step. Children delight in taking turns jumping and forcing a jounce in the other child's step.
Tire swings. A tire swing is an alternative style swing that allows children to tackle the swinging thing up to three at a time. Spin or sway, its up to the children.
Slides. Slides can be short or long and they can spiral or go straight or go bump, bump, bump. Slides have come a long way since the 50s and 60s when they were all made out of metal. Now slides can be made out of plastics, just beware of the static electricity build up.
Tunnels. Tunnels are great ways to get a child's inner energy out and the best thing is, it can go under the swingset or next to it or be used for an obstacle course. Made out of plastic, make sure its covered by shade as these can get really hot in the sun.
Telephone cans. Modern telephone cans are funnels which have sprinkler-type heads. The connecting tubing can be buried below the play set so that two kids can go on opposite sides and whisper secret messages to one another or plan a secret rendezvous.
Ball pits. Each of the next following items can be really fun, but they also come with their own warnings. Ball pits are great fun and the pleasure of sinking into a pit filled with semi-soft objects that can be thrown at others can be entirely enjoyable. However, a warning would be that for younger kids the temptation to go wee-wee while not being seen is a little tempting and spiders enjoy the shaded areas that the balls en-masse present.
Sand Pits. The hours that can be spent digging, creating a castle and destroying it afterward can feel rewarding. Watch out for kitties and other critters of the night which can perceive this as a litterbox. Also, some spiders actually enjoy burrowing in the sand as a good cool place to be.
Water Play. A water fountain or a shooting spout can be the best of summertime enjoyment. Be sure to have a way to turn it off for winter and non-use times. If it is to be for public use, post the times the play park will be active and stick to that schedule. Try to have anti-microbial rubber matting or cement with more texture to allow for children running and playing in the water. If you choose to have it move, to prevent standing water where insects can breed, then have jets at appropriate intervals to 'move the water.'

Cut the fabric.,
Turn under the seam allowance at both the top and bottom of the fabric length.,
Along the long side, turn in 6.25cm/2.4 inches each side, twice.,
Measure the tab-top tape across each short end and cut.,
Cut the piece of dowel into two even halves.,
Push the first half of the dowel through the base tabs of the hammock.,
Prepare the ski rope.,
Hold one end of the rope about 8cm/20 inches from its end.,
Repeat at the end with the arc.,
Adjust to ensure evenness.",How to Make a Hammock1," Measure the fabric to 225cm/88.5 inches long and 128cm/50.3 inches wide, then cut.;
, Make this 1.25cm/0.49 inches and do it twice. Sew in place.

, Sew in place. This forms the casing for the ropes.

, Pin in place at each end, then turn under and stitch to the first fabric piece. Use strong stitching and do two rows for added strength.


Do not sew across the rope casings on each long side.

, Drill an 8mm/0.31 of an inch hole at each end of the dowel, 3cm/1.1 inches in from the ends.

, Then thread the other dowel through the top end.

, Cut the rope to 9 meters/354 inches. Singe the ends to stop fraying (use a lighter, hot plate or candle flame).


Place the hammock on a flat surface such as a clear long table or the floor.
Patiently thread the rope through the first hole of one dowel. Then push the rope all the way down the casing and up through the exact opposite dowel hole at the other long end of the hammock.
Pull the rope over and leave about 1.6 meters/62 inches of it out. Then, thread the rest of the rope down through the other dowel hole on the same short side, then through the casing down to the other dowel hole at the beginning end.
The two loose ends of the rope (the other end is an unbroken arc) should measure about 1 meter/39 inches each. Adjust if needed.

, Pull the rope back on itself so that the weave opens. Push the singed rope end into the open weave at least 40-50 cm/15.7-19.5 inches. Press down on it, then tug tight. The rope will stay embedded and won't pull apart (test it by tugging).


If the rope you're using does do this, tie a firm knot instead.

, Cut the rope in half, then wind the ends around the dowel at the one third and two thirds points of the dowel. Then open the weave as above, feed in the other rope end and pull tight to seal.


You could also not create the loop. Instead tie large knots at the dowel entry point to prevent the rope from slipping through, then tie the loose ends around a large object such as a tree trunk or hang from hammock hangers attached to porch poles, etc.

, Hang the hammock on the hammock frame by looping it around the frame holes.

Turn the short ends of the canvas in 3.8cm/1.5 inches.,
Mark 20 evenly spaced spots along each end of the hammock.,
Punch the grommets into place along the marks.

,
Cut the rope.,
Braid the rope into harnesses.,
Attach the unwoven ends of the rope to the relevant grommet.,
Hang from trees or poles.",How to Make a Hammock2,"


Lengthen the measurements if tall people will be using the hammock. Bear in mind that 15cm/6 inches will be lost from making the hammock.

, Sew a seam.

, Press into place. Repeat one more time and press in place. Then sew the pressed ends together, using at least two or three rows of stitching. Keep the stitches at least 2.5cm/1 inch from the end, to leave space for the grommets.

, These mark the grommet placement.


Use an invisible fabric marker or tailor's chalk.

,, Cut it into 10 smaller ropes, each 2.7 meters/9 feet long.

, The most typical macrame braid is the clew knot:


Fold the cords in half.
Mount the folded cords to the ring with a larks head knot.
Slip the ring over an upturned milkshake cup or secure to the work surface in some other way.
Spread the cords out and straighten them.
Number the ends of the cords 1 through 20.
Weave the clew knot using all of the cords - see How to weave a clew knot for precise details.

, Use the instructions in How to make a clew knot to get it correct. When adding the ropes, use a strong knot, such as a bowline knot. Pull taut to tighten and test the strength of the hammock.

, Tie tightly. Test for weight suitability before lying in it.

Select either a tarpaulin or blanket for making this hammock with.

,
Cut the tarp or blanket to size.,
Pull one end of the tarp or blanket together in a bunch.,
Wrap the rope around a tree several times.",How to Make a Hammock3,", This is optional, only if needed. Allow for sag in the middle, below your feet and above your head before choosing to cut.


If you want to be able to use the item again for its original purpose, avoid cutting it.

, Tie this together with either a lark's head knot or clove hitch using strong rope.

, Then send it across to the opposite tree or anchor point. Repeat the wrap and tying process at the other end of the tarp or blanket. This will ensure a taut line is drawn above the hammock bed, which you can pull on to get in and out of the hammock. It also provides a place to hang a rain fly.


If you don't want the fly rope, you can always cut your rope in two, keeping the head and foot sections separate.
Use the tarp as a rain fly. If the tarp is twice as long as you are, double it over and hang above the hammock. This will create a fly for keeping off rain or for providing shade.

Start out.,
Practice prone paddling.,
Try knee paddling.,
Make sure you hold the paddle right.,
Paddle properly.,
Stand up.,
Turn.,
Back paddle when necessary.,
Stop your board.",How to Paddle Board," Finding calm wind is not necessary but always a good idea for your first hours on a board. If you are ‘launching’ your board off of a beach you can easily be swept down the beach and if enough wind is blowing you will see your board can act like a sail. Seek calm water as well; waves make it much more difficult to balance.


Comfort is key for first timers! We love launching new paddle boarders into a lazy, well protected river where they can easily make shore if need be.;
, Prone paddling can be used to get further away from the shore and into deeper water. To do so, lie down on the board and lie the paddle vertically along the board with the blade under your chest so it doesn't float away. With one arm on either side of the board, paddle as if you are swimming.

, Carefully sit up and position yourself on your knees. Make sure to hold on to your paddle so it doesn't float away. You want to remain in the center of the board so the nose and tail stay level with the water.

, Holding a paddle board paddle is similar to how you would hold a canoe paddle. Place one hand on the T Bar grip at the top of the shaft and the other hand slightly past the the middle, closer to the blade. You can switch hands as needed to paddle on both sides to keep the board straight. Make sure the paddle is facing the right way! The angle of the blade should be facing away from you- this will eliminate drag.

, Adjust the paddle to the proper height, which is about 8"" overhead. Keep your arms relatively straight to get a wider range of motion. You will be using a lot of core strength, more so than your arms. Paddle using a down and back motion, dipping the paddle in the water at the front side of your board and pushing it towards the back side. Switch sides every few paddles to remain straight.

, Place the paddle horizontally across the front of your board and place your feet in the center where your knees once were. You should be in a squatting position. Slowly stand up while holding on to your paddle. Keep your knees bent and your feet about shoulder width apart. Your feet should be parallel to each other. One foot in front of the other may make it more difficult to balance.

, Paddle on one side of the board without switching sides until you are facing the direction you want to go. You will turn the opposite direction of the side you are paddling on.

, Back paddling can be used to take smaller, quicker turns. Move the paddle from back to front. Dip your paddle in the water behind you, rather than in front of you, and push it forward.

, Back paddle just a few times to get your board to slow down. Continuing to back paddle will cause your board to turn. A more advanced method of stopping is to step back on the tail of the board to sink it under water.

Check the hammock tension.,
Place your hands on one side of the hammock to steady yourself, then sit down.,
Quickly swing your legs over the side and up onto the hammock.

,
Find your center of balance.,
Lie in the hammock.",How to Lie in a Hammock," There should be a decent dip or hang in the hammock––it shouldn't be too tight and it should appear comfortable to you. Also check that it has been suspended properly (if you have hung it yourself, you should already know this).;
, Try to make sure that your butt is in the center of the hammock. Never try lying down in a hammock first––sitting is the best way to get into it.

,, Depending on your weight and if you're on a hill, your center of balance won't always be in the exact middle. Shift your weight left or right to decide.

, Most people find that the back or side positions are the most comfortable when lying in a hammock. Stomach sleeping or resting doesn't tend to be as comfortable but you could try it before assuming it won't work for you.Most important of all, unless you're in a taut spreader bar hammock, you should find yourself lying diagonally and not straight. This is important because it lets you lie in the hammock for hours without back discomfort, with plenty of support and space."
"
Choose a gentle hill for the slide.,
Purchase thick plastic at the right length.,
Roll out the plastic over your hill.",How to Make a Homemade Water Slide1," Find a soft grassy hill to begin creating your own water slide. The best location is a hill with plenty of flat space to get a running start at the top, as well as more flat space to slow down at the bottom.


Use measuring tape and help from a friend to determine how long the space is that you’ll be using. This will help you to buy the right length of plastic for the slide.
Note that the steeper the hill is, the more material you will need to extend past the hill, where sliders can slow down on a flat surface.
Note that you will also need the slide to be positioned somewhere close enough for access to a garden hose.;
, Based on your measurements, buy a length of heavy plastic sheeting for your slide. Opt for a width of about 6 feet for a good amount of sliding area, and plastic thickness of 6 millimeters for the most durability.Look or ask for plastic sheeting at a hardware store. You can use a heavy-duty contractor drop cloth, a long tarp, or other plastic sheeting available.
It’s best to buy clear or light-colored plastic, as black will absorb more heat and become very hot in the sun.

, Spread out your plastic sheeting over your grassy hill. Get assistance from friends or family to help unroll or unfold and adjust the plastic.


Use sandbags or other heavy objects on the corners or sides of your plastic to help hold it in place, especially if it is windy.
Remember to position your plastic so that there is a flat portion of the slide at the bottom of the hill you set up on. Otherwise, sliders will come to an abrupt and painful stop on the grass after building up speed from sliding on the hill.

Add pool noodle buffers if desired.,
Stake down the plastic with garden staples.,
Set up a garden hose.",How to Make a Homemade Water Slide2," Create a soft barrier to prevent slipping off the edges of the slide if you wish to. Wrap foam pool noodles in the edges of the plastic and secure them with velcro to make the buffers.


Lay out pool noodles end to end on both long sides of your plastic, as well as the end if you want a stopper. The number of pool noodles will vary depending on your plastic length, but you can calculate based on a typical pool noodle length of 5 feet and a suggested 1 foot of space in between each noodle.
Wrap the edges of the plastic all the way around the pool noodles so that the plastic touches itself again. Place 2 inch pieces of velcro where the plastic overlaps, at the ends and middle of each pool noodle, to keep them wrapped securely.
Flip the whole slide over once all the pool noodles are secured in the plastic with velcro. This will create a smooth surface for sliding and prevent the velcro from coming undone., Use U-shaped garden staples to stake down the plastic for your slide. Push the staples through the plastic and into the ground at intervals along each long side of your slide to hold it in place. Make sure the plastic is pulled very taut before staking.


Cover each garden staple with a piece of duct tape to protect them from being stepped on or slid over. Use a bright color for the tape so that it’s highly visible.If you have enough material, fold over a small portion of your plastic once or twice at the top of the slide to double or quadruple it before staking it down. This will reinforce against tears at the beginning of the slide, which will get the most pull when sliders run and jump onto it., Place a garden hose at the top of your slide so that the water runs down the length of the plastic. Use a sprinkler or multiple water sources for a greater spread of water.


Use a sprayer attachment on your hose, or a full sprinkler, to create a spray or mist of water so that it covers the whole slide. Use several sprinklers if you have them.
You can also purchase a long sprinkler hose to run down the whole length of the slide to keep it wet."
"
Turn the hose on and add dish soap.,
Get a running start to slide.,
Roll up the slide after use.",How to Make a Homemade Water Slide3," Add inexpensive dish soap or shampoo to the surface of your slide to make sliding easier and faster. Then turn on your hose or sprinkler to get water flowing down the slide.


Add more of the dish soap/shampoo to the slide periodically to keep it slippery.Keep the water from running down just the middle or one part of the slide by making sure there are no major creases or wrinkles in the plastic, or using multiple hoses/sprinklers.

, Give yourself enough room to get a running start at the top of the slide to gain speed. Then jump on the plastic on your stomach, back, or rear end to slide all the way down.


Make sure to wear a bathing suit or clothing that will slide easily and that you don’t mind getting dirty or grass stained in the event that you slide off the plastic.
It will help to get yourself wet or even lightly covered with the dish soap/shampoo before your first run on the slide for the best results.

, Take down the slide after one or two uses to prevent the death of the grass underneath if that’s a concern. Grass will easily get ripped up by the friction of sliding and/or browned by the accelerated heat of the plastic over it.


There is also the chance of the plastic getting dirty, ripped, or even melted by environmental factors if left out between uses.
If you used pool noodles, simple roll up the slide over the noodles at either edge, removing the stopper noodle if you have one, and fold it at the breaks in between noodles. At the end of the season, you can take all the noodles out to store the slide more compactly.
You should be able to get several uses, even the whole summer, out of your homemade water slide with durable plastic and normal use. This can be a cost savings over store-bought water slides, which often have to be replaced after the first use.

Let surface air dry with respect to adhesive directions.",How to Patch a Leak in an Inflatable Stand Up Paddleboard,"


Inflate your paddleboard and apply a weight
Listen for a whistling sound - this is a great way to find the general area of a leak.;
, Place a finger on the exact location and dry the area.

Apply soapy water to the suspected area while applying some weight to your paddleboard.
The largest bubbles will form directly above the leak.
This step is important because leaks may be microscopic - invisible to the naked eye.

, The marker serves a visual aid as you prepare the patch.,


Use a marker to indicate the leak source and about 3-4 inches in each direction away from the source.

,

The patch should extend about 2-4in away from the leak in each direction for maximum effectiveness.

,

Smooth both the leak’s surrounding area and the to-be-applied side of the patch.
Wipe down the sanded areas with a wet rag to remove any dust residue.

, Use soapy water and then MEK.

The MEK is an industrial solvent that prepares the plastics for a strong bond. Wear proper protective equipment.

,


Follow adhesive-specific directions! These should be located on the bottle.
Apply appropriate coats to both the marked patch area and the to-be-applied side of the patch (usually 2-3). Wait 20 minutes in-between application.
Test stickiness of glue with a knuckle test - your knuckle should come away cleanly from the glue without leaving a dent.
Be generous in glue distribution.

, Patience and precision are important when placing patch to avoid trapping air bubbles.

When back out on the water, moisture will leak into any trapped air bubbles and increase the likelihood of further air leakage.

,


Roll the patch in at least 4 directions to maximize surface area adhesion between the patch and the SUP.

,


The paddleboard should cure in a dry area for at least 24 hours before being inflated and taken back on the water. Moisture will loosen the adhesive bonding and ruin the patch.

Put your baby in the hammock.",How to Make a Baby Hammock Swing," Prepare everything you need to make the baby hammock swing before you start. You will need:


3 meters of strong, thick fabric, like muslin, 40 inches (101.6 cm) wide
A 6 inch (15.2 cm) spring
A hook
A steel ring
A chain
A board:1 inch thick, 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide and 2 feet in length
A snap hook or quick link;
, The first thing you need to do is create the swing itself. Fold the edges of the fabric inwards by about 2 inches (5.1 cm) and sew all the way around.


Spread the fabric flat on the ground, then fold it in half lengthwise. Sew the two edges together to create a big ring of fabric.

, Next, you need to make the bottom of your baby hammock swing. Measure 14 inches (35.6 cm) from the first seam and sew another seam at that place, across the width.


Fold over those 14 inches (35.6 cm) of material and sew it in place. It needs to be attached to the rest of the fabric, to provide a reinforced bottom for the hammock swing.

, Make a canal for the elastic at the top of the swing. Determine where the baby's head would be.


Measure 8 inches (20.3 cm) on each side of the bottom center of your swing (the part with the 14-inch). On one side, fold over a ¾ inch strip fabric to create a channel for the elastic band.
Insert the elastic band, sew it down on one end, then gather the material until it forms about 6 inches (15.2 cm) in total. Once you've gathered the material, sew the other end of the elastic in place. .

, Make ties at the bottom end of the hammock using bias tape. Use 13 inches (33.0 cm) of tape for each tie, then just knot the end.


Find the center point at the bottom of the hammock and measure the 4 inch (10.2 cm), 8 inch (20.3 cm) and 12 inch (30.5 cm) points on either side. Mark these places.
Sew the 13 inch (33.0 cm) ties on the underside of the swing at these spots.

, Get the foam and cut a 14 x 30 inch piece to make a pillow. Make a pillowcase from the same fabric as the swing by measuring the size of the pillow.


Cut out two pieces of fabric that are 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) larger than the measurement of the pillow on all sides and sew three of the sides together. If the fabric has a print, make sure its on the inside when you sew the edges
Leave the fourth side of the pillowcase open. When you finish, turn the pillowcase right side out and insert the pillow.
You can close the open side of the pillowcase by sewing on buttons or a zip.

, Find a good place in your home for the hammock swing. Once you've found an appropriate spot, drill a hole in the ceiling and insert a hook.


Ensure that the ceiling is strong enough and make sure the hook is securely in place.
Check the hole and the hook from time to time because as it can start to come loose after a lot of swinging.
Make sure that there is space to swing. The swing must be at least 14 inches (35.6 cm) away from any barriers or hard surfaces, such as walls or edges of furniture.
Hang the spring on the hook. The spring will allow the swing to gently bounce while swinging.

, Measure the length of the chain that you need, depending on how low you want to set the hammock swing. You shouldn't make the swing too high, in fact it should be relatively close to the floor.


Measure from the top and do not forget to include the dimension of the swing in the measurement.
Measure the height of your hammock swing from the steel ring to the bottom of the swing.
Consider putting a mattress beneath the swing, that way if your baby falls they will not be hurt.
Place the chain on the spring. At the other end put the carabiner or a quick link.

, Cut a ""U"" shape into each end of the wooden board. Each ""U"" should be ¾ inches wide and 1 ½ inches into the board.


Pull the free ends of the swing fabric through these holes. Make sure the bottom of the swing is in the middle.
Secure the ends of the fabric by tying them up with additional ties.

, The steel ring should be in the middle of the fabric. Make sure the bottom of the swing is centered and that it stays flat.

Choose your time wisely.,
Select bait according to diet.",How to Catch Flathead Catfish1," In most areas, fishing is regulated by a local government agency, like the Department of Natural Resources. This prevents overfishing and helps to maintain the health of the aquatic ecosystem. Fishing without the right permit could result in a steep fine, the seizure of property, or even detainment, in extreme cases.;
, Flathead catfish prefer lower level light, and will spend most daylight hours in the shade of a tree or rock, or in underwater holes and caves. Flatheads can be found in virtually any sufficiently deep freshwater body of water throughout North America and into northern Mexico.


Expect to find catfish toward the bottom of rivers and lakes, where there is cover and shade.
Muddy waters can be favorable for flathead fishing., During late June and early July, which is spawning season for the Flathead, males will guard the mouths of caves where females lay eggs. This time of year can be hit or miss for flathead fishing, as mating can distract from feeding. However, the time leading up to spawning, when the fish are voraciously eating in preparation to spawn, can yield a better than average catch.


Generally, the summer months are favorable for flathead catfishing.
Flathead catfish can be lethargic and difficult to catch in the winter months.
The lower level light of dawn, dust, and overcast/rainy days are ideal times to go flathead fishing., Flatheads are notorious carnivores and prefer live prey. Many flathead anglers find that smaller fish, like bluegill and perch, work well as bait. Other food you might want to consider to tempt flatheads to your line include:Chicken liver
Chicken gizzards
Cheese

Choose your fishing style.,
Select your fishing location.,
Gather your fishing supplies.,
Rig your fishing line and bait your hook.,

Ready yourself for a fight.,
Relocate at intervals to improve your chances.",How to Catch Flathead Catfish2," You might have a favorite river that you already know is home to a good crop of flatheads, but you'll have to decide if you want to cast your line from shore or troll for catfish in a boat. Either can be productive for catfishing, though you'll want to be careful of causing too much noise in the water.Flathead catfish have poor vision, but are sensitive to disturbances in the water.

, Choosing your location can be difficult, especially for beginners. You can make use of maps that track flathead spawning patterns and populations, which can be found through an online search for ""flathead catfish maps."", Before you grab your tackle box and pole and rush off to catch some flatheads, you'll want to make sure your equipment is up to the task. Flatheads can be fierce; you'll want 80 – 100 pound test fishing line if you plan on fishing for moderate to large catfish. You'll also need your bait and a dependable fishing pole.


Flathead catfish have numerous, fine teeth that can wear down and weaken your line over time.
Have sinker weights on hand to ensure your bait reaches the bottom of the water in which you are fishing, where the flatheads live.
Larger sized bait should be used to fish for larger flatheads.

, Since flatheads prefer to live at the bottom of bodies of water, hiding in cracks, crevices, and caves, don't forget to put some sinkers on your line. Then bait your hook with your choice of bait., Your goal is to place your bait slightly above or just about level with likely flathead ""beds."" It can take minutes or hours before you get a bite on your line, so a bite indicator, like a bobber, bait clicker, or bell, can help you notice when you finally have one on the line., Flathead catfish can grow to incredible sizes, with some prize catches weighing in at over 100 pounds. Don't be taken by surprise when you have a flathead on the line. Give a yank when you feel the catfish bite to set the hook, then keep your rod pointed upward and begin reeling in the fish., Sometimes, the fish just aren't biting, and when that happens it can help to change location. Wait at least 20 minutes or so before reeling in your line and moving to a different location."
"
Know nesting locations.,
Wait until spawning season.,
Go with a friend.,
Enter the water near a flathead nest.,
Listen for thumping to identify nests.,
Reach inside the nest and hook the fish with your hand.,
Reach through the gills of larger fish for better control.",How to Catch Flathead Catfish3," Avid catfish noodlers spend years searching for and discovering popular nesting spots for Flatheads. You can accelerate this process by tagging along with an experienced noodler, or you might visit locations you've had luck pole fishing for flatheads, as these areas will likely have nests nearby., When noodling, you'll be hunting for male flatheads that are guarding spawning holes and caves. Noodling relies on provoking the male flathead to latch onto your arm, allowing you to draw the fish out of his hole.


Spawning season for flathead catfish takes place at the end of June and beginning of July.
Noodling for Flatheads outside of spawning season will likely be difficult.

, You never know what you might run in to in the murky water, so it's best to go noodling with a friend. That way, if you trip or get tangled in some roots, you have someone who can help you to safety.


Larger catfish, when noodled, might try to break free from your hold by twisting and thrashing.
If you've noodled an especially large catfish, you may need the help of a friend to wrestle your flathead free of the water., But before you do, remove any loose clothing that might get tangled in roots or make moving the water difficult. Once you're in the water, you might want to squish your hands in the muck to remove any ""human scent"" from your body that can scare away fish.

, When you believe you have found a suitable nest, dive underwater and listen carefully. You should hear a dull thumping noise; this is the flathead striking his tail to indicate it is guarding his nest. Approach the hole, and prepare to reach inside to provoke the fish., You may be able to gently slip your thumb into one side of the fish's gills, sticking your other fingers into his mouth to get a handle of it. As you do so, slowly but steadily wrap your other arm around the body of the catfish.


More aggressive catfish may bite you when noodling. This may startle you, but is not dangerous. The teeth of flathead catfish are too fine to do serious damage, though these may leave small marks or indentations on your skin.
When bitten, grab the lower jaw, which is shaped like a handle, and use your other arm to control the fish., Larger fish will have gill openings that should be large enough for you to fit a few fingers or, in some cases, your hand. Doing this will give you more control over larger fish, but will damage the gills, eventually causing the fish to die."

Try string and bait catching.,
Use open or closed traps.,
Catch crawfish by hand.,
Get a fishing license.,
Go crawfishing between April and October.,
Look for crawfish in freshwater lakes, ponds and creeks.,
Go crawfishing at night.,
Use the correct bait.,
Secure the bait properly.,
Cook the crawfish.,
Keep them as pets.",How to Catch Crawfish," String and bait catching is a simple way of catching crawfish and makes for a fun family activity. All you need is a fishing pole, rod or stick, some fishing line or string, and some bait.


You can attach the bait to the string using a fish hook or even a safety pin - this will ensure that the bait remains attached to the string and prevents the crawfish from getting away.
Lower the bait into the water and wait patiently until you feel a tug on the end of the string. Then slowly move the crawfish and bait as close to the shore as possible before gently pulling it out of the water. Immediately place the crawfish into a bucket.
If you like, you can use a fishnet with a long handle to scoop up the crawfish as soon as your reel them in. This will prevent them from releasing the bait and getting away.;
, Traps are the best way to catch large quantities of crawfish with relatively little effort. So if you want to feed your friends and family a crawfish feast, this is the way to go.


There are two main types of traps: open traps, which are basically collapsible nets that are open on one end, and closed traps, a more advanced variety with a funnel on one end which allows the crawfish to enter the trap, but prevents them from escaping.
Avoid using square-shaped traps as these can catch on rocks at the bottom of the water and become trapped or broken. Cylindrical-, conical- and beehive-shaped traps are all better options. Crawfish traps should be less than three feet in height, width and depth.Before you lower the traps into the water, you will need to bait them. Some traps have a hook in the center to which you can attach the bait, while other require the use of bait boxes or bait jars.
Open traps can be left in the water for several hours at a time, as long as there is enough bait, while closed traps can be left overnight. With any luck, when you pull the trap up again it will be filled with crawfish. Under the right conditions, you can catch 15 to 20 pounds of crawfish per trap!, A third option for catching crawfish is just to catch them by hand, as they are often found amongst the rocks in shallow pools and can easily be picked up -- just watch out for those sharp claws!


To catch a crawfish by hand, you will need to find a pond, creek or lake that is well known for its crawfish population. Crawfish typically like to hide under rocks and plants in the shallow parts of the water.
To catch a crawfish, wade into the water and look for rocks that seem likely to be hiding a crawfish. Then very slowly reach your hand into the water and gently lift up the rock. If you lift it too quickly it can startle the crawfish and stir up mud which obstructs your vision, allowing the crawfish to scurry away.
If you lift the rock correctly, you should see a crawfish just sitting underwater. Now you have two options. The first option is just to pick the crawfish up with your bare hands. If it's very small, you can reach your hands into the water and cup it between both hands. If it's larger, you can pick it up using the thumb and forefinger of one hand, just behind the pinchers.
Your second option is to use a small bucket and stick. Gently place the bucket 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) behind the crawfish, then wave the stick in front of it or give it a light tap. Crawfish swim backwards, so it should swim directly into the bucket. Once it's in there, scoop the bucket out of the water.Whatever you do, don't blindly thrust your hand into the water, or you could get a nasty pinch!

, In many states, a fishing license is required to catch crawfish. However once this license is acquired, you can catch as many crawfish as you like, 365 days a year.


Family fishing licenses (which entitles any member of the family to fish) are available for purchase at your local state department, for a fee of approximately $60.
When using crawfish traps, the license number must be engraved on or attached to the trap, along with your name and address., Crawfish are most active during the warmer months of the year, so the best time to go fishing for them is between April and October. However, it is still possible to catch crawfish during the colder months, just don't expect to find as many.

, Crawfish are freshwater crustaceans and can be found in many bodies of water across the U.S.A. and in countries around the world.


They make their homes in streams, ponds and lakes, in addition to canals, reservoirs, springs and bedrock pools.
Most crawfish seem to prefer still or slow-moving water, with plenty of rocks and vegetation to provide cover.

, Crawfish are nocturnal, which means they are most active at night, especially in warmer waters or during the summer months. Therefore, many people will set out to catch crawfish at dusk, or will leave traps in the water overnight and collect them in the morning.


If you plan on leaving traps in the water overnight, make sure to attach a piece of string tied around a cork. This will allow you to find the traps easily in the light of day.
However, crawfish can still be tempted by bait during the day, so catching them during daylight hours is not impossible.
Go fishing at whatever time works for you. Just remember that nighttime crawfishing expeditions can be a lot of fun!

, The best bait to use for crawfishing is widely debated, however most sources will agree that you can't go wrong with the heads, tails and guts of oily fish which are native to the local area.


Fish like salmon, herring, carp, perch, walleye and trout all work well as crawfish bait, but things like sardines, squid, clams, sole and eel will not.
Other options include any kind of fatty, raw meat such as chicken or pork. Crawfish are also attracted to pieces of hot dog and even fish-based cat food (though some crawfish experts would disagree with this).
The most important thing when it comes to bait is that the meat is fresh. Crawfish will not be attracted to old, spoiled or smelly meat, contrary to popular belief., When you are using traps to catch crawfish, it is essential that the bait is properly secured.


With some basic traps, the bait is simply hung from a hook in the center of the trap. This works well, but if the traps are left underwater for too long, the crawfish will eat all of the bait, then lose interest and escape from the trap.
Therefore, many crawfish experts recommend using bait boxes - these allow the crawfish to feed and enable the smell of the bait to disperse through the water, attracting more crawfish. But because the bait is less accessible, it will not be eaten as quickly, so the crawfish remain in the trap for longer.
Another option is bait jars - these allow the smell of the bait to disperse through the water, but do not allow the crawfish to feed. The bait will last for longer, but the crawfish are not as likely to stay in the trap once they realize that they cannot feed.

, Crawfish contain a delicious sweet white meat which can be eaten on its own or used in a variety of southern-style dishes such as crawfish jambalaya, crawfish etouffee and crawfish bisque. Crawfish can also replace other shellfish such as lobster and crab in most dishes.


First, kill the crawfish by thrusting a sharp knife between the head and thorax, or by submerging them in ice or boiling water for several minutes.
To cook them, boil a pot of plain water and add some salt, black pepper and cayenne for authentic Acadian seasoning. Rinse any mud or debris off the crawfish with clean water.
If you wish to purge the vein inside the crawfish (intestines) before cooking, mix half a cup of salt or white vinegar with a bucket of clean water and leave the crawfish to soak in it for 30 minutes. When the water turns murky, they are ready to cook.
Place the whole crawfish (or just the tails and large claws) into the pot of boiling water and leave for approximately 5 minutes, or until the shells turn bright red. If you like, you can add additional ingredients to the water such as seafood boil, onions, jalapenos or cilantro.
Eat the crawfish on their own, dipped in butter and lemon juice or covered in cocktail sauce. Serve with corn on the cob and boiled potatoes for a hearty post-fishing lunch or dinner. , Some people like to keep crawfish as pets, as they are easy to care for and are fascinating for children to watch. Sometimes they can even be brought to school and kept as a classroom pet!


Transport the crawfish by keeping them somewhere damp and cool. Do not place the crawfish in a bucket of water as most species need to oxygen to survive and will die in stagnant water. As long as the crawfish is kept moist, it can survive out of water for several days.
Keep the crawfish in an oxygenated aquarium on its own, as it will eat other fish. It can feed off any vegetation you place in the aquarium or you can feed it fish heads and trimmings, fatty meats or any of the bait described above.
Be aware that some states forbid people from taking live crawfish away from their capture site. Some states (such as Arizona) forbid people from taking live crawfish home - they must be killed at the site of capture. So if you are considering bringing a crawfish home for a pet, make sure to look up your state's regulations first.

You can look on government websites for catfish stocking schedules and information or check with local farmers to see if they stock catfish in their ponds.;
, You can find channel catfish in most kinds of water bodies including lakes, ponds, and rivers.Ask around and find out where people have the most luck catching channel catfish in your area. Or, you can just start trying out different locations for yourself.


In the US, channel catfish are particularly common ranging from the Appalachian Mountains toward the central part of the United States.Channel catfish can only survive in freshwater, so don’t go looking for them in bodies of saltwater.

, Catfish prefer submerged areas that give them something to hide in and provide them shelter from the water’s currents. Watch for fallen timber, large rocks, sunken boats, or other submerged debris that would give the catfish a nice, calm hiding place. These will be good areas to fish.Although clearer water is easier for you to see in, you will probably find more channel catfish in cloudy water. They prefer to hide, so the cloudier water near the bank or under a rock near a strong current are better places to look.

, These kinds of rods bend less in the body and make it easier to catch and reel in a larger sized fish, such as a big channel catfish.Catching catfish requires a much different skillset than, say, fly fishing. While fly fishing is very active, with repeated casts and constant movement, fishing for channel catfish is much more sedentary. It is about finding the right spot, using the right bait, and waiting for the catfish to be attracted and come to you.

, Research the location. If shad/chubs frequent the area, use cut bait, whole shad/chubs, or live shad/chubs. If not, use worms, doughbait, dip bait, or cut hot dogs.


Usually, cut bait is the best because catfish are attracted by the odors of the bait.Using cut bait simply means that you slice up a smaller fish’s carcass to use as bait to catch a larger fish. You can cut it into sections (head, midsection, tail) or use slices of the body lengthwise.You should check your bait every 40 minutes or so to make sure that it is still there. This is often enough to be effective, but not so often that it will disrupt the fish and spook them away from your fishing area.

, Use 20-30-lb line, 1/4 ounce weights, and sturdy hooks. Catfish can weigh up to 100 lbs, so it is important to get gear that can withstand the pull of a larger fish.Using sturdy hooks and strong 20 or 30-lb lines will help ensure that you won’t lose your fish once you hook him.

, Use a single shank, bait-holding hook for any form of shad/chub or the hot dogs. Use a treble hook for worms and doughbait. For dip bait, cut a piece of sponge into a cube, force the eye of a treble hook through it, and dip it in the dip bait., Catfish can pull with an enormous amount of force. If you aren’t careful, some of the bigger fish could easily pull you under with their strength. For this reason, it’s important to use a holder when fishing for channel catfish.If you are fishing from the shore, anchor the holder to the ground so that your pole will be connected more securely. If you are fishing from a boat, anchor the holder to the side of your boat.

, Channel catfish can be very lethargic, so be patient. You aren’t likely to get a hit right away. As with most fishing, it takes time and patience to catch channel catfish., When your line straightens, the fish has your bait. Let the fish pull the slack out of your line before you start reeling.Set the hook and be ready to use your strength because these fish can and will fight until subdued.

, Channel catfish behavior, as with that of most living things, varies from season to season. Knowing how to alter your fishing methods based on their seasonal behavior will greatly increase the likelihood that you will catch one, no matter what season you fish in.


During the late winter and early spring, channel catfish prefer deeper water because it is slightly warmer. So during this time, try using a bait with a strong rotting odor (like cut bait).During the spring, summer, and fall, channel catfish are one of the only fish that can be caught in high stream flows. In these warmer months, melting snow and rain water cause the water levels to rise. Channel catfish are one of the few types of fish that can take on these stronger current flows.
In the summer months, you can fish for channel catfish by wading in smaller streams. Use prepared bait for pan-sized catfish and chubs or cut bait for larger channel catfish.
You can even catch channel catfish during the winter (even if you have to fish through the ice). You just need a little patience and some cut bait to attract the catfish from the deeper waters.

Thin line (4 pound test is usually fine, but use 6 pound test in cloudier waters)
Small bronze hooks (#10 or #14 size)
Sinkers and bobbers, if desired
Bait (nightcrawlers work best)
Lures, if you are not using live bait (any kind of small, minnow-like spinner or jig)Wading boots (if you don’t want to get wet)
A net and canvas creel (to help you catch and hold your fish, if needed);
, While still on dry land, place half of a nightcrawler on the end of a small hook.Pierce it only once, at either end. If you are using a lure, attach it securely to your line.

, Walk up to the water quietly, from downstream.Try to keep yourself hidden from the fish—avoid casting any shadow on the water in front of you, for instance. Get to the side of the stream, and find a good spot to stand and cast. Do not, however, enter the water.

, Throw your line swiftly and smoothly, aiming upstream.This allows your bait to drift back to you.


If you are using a lure, you can cast in any direction. This will imitate the natural free movement of minnows.

, The light line used for brook trout fishing will float on the water.Keep an eye on it as your bait drifts back to you. If the line goes from slack to stretched out, you may have a bite. Reel it in and enjoy the catch!


If you are fishing in deeper water, you can also add split shot sinkers to your line., Work slowly and gently to avoid scaring the fish.


If you disturb the water, kick up mud, make too much noise, etc., then move across the stream or to another location and try again.

, If you catch a fish and intend to release it, wet your hands before handling it.This will preserve the fish’s protective coating and keep it healthy. If you want to keep the fish, remove the hook and put the fish in your creel.


If you have caught a fish and it is deeply hooked, just cut your line to free it., If you’ve tried and tried, but still haven’t had a bite, move upstream.You may find more fish there, and you can fish your way downstream when you are coming back.

, Good fishers care about their catch and its environment. Make sure to be familiar with all laws regulating Brook trout in your area before you go fishing, and follow them. If required in your area, you must also have a valid fishing license.


Many states have laws regarding the number of Brook trout you can catch and keep. They may also impose weight or length minimums. These regulations are designed to conserve Brook trout populations, which have been reduced in some areas.Certain locations, such as National or State Parks, may have regulations that differ from a state’s regular laws. Heed all posted information.
In some areas, there are restrictions on how you can fish for Brook trout. For instance, some may have laws stating that you must use artificial lures.

, Check with your local department of natural resources for tips. Your state’s DNR may share maps or other information sharing which waters are known to be best for fishing for brook trout, for example.,, Brook trout tend to live in small streams with good water.When choosing a spot to cast your line, don’t overlook small pools and riffles. Brook trout often gather in water that is relatively shallow, and around logs, overhangs, and other cover in the water. In larger streams, you can also try near the headwaters, since brook trout like to congregate there., The best time to catch brook trout depends on the season.You are most likely to catch them in the afternoon during the springtime, and in the morning hours in warmer summer months., Brook trout seem to be especially active during times that insects are hatching, such as when midges hatch in the spring.Cloudy or unpleasant weather can also be a surprisingly good time to fish for brook trout. In locations where ponds freeze over, brook trout may be easiest to catch just after the ice melts, since they will be hungry.

Choose a cane pole or light-weight rod & reel, 2-6 pound test line, and a small, barbed hook (sizes #6, 8, or 10) with a bobber (for fishing for shallow or suspended fish) attached 12–18 inches (30.5–45.7 cm) from the hook, with a small split-shot sinker attached 8–10 inches (20.3–25.4 cm) from the hook.,
Use live bait (Pan fish worms, Wax worms, night crawlers, baby crayfish 1-2in, small minnows 1in).,
Wake up early in the morning.,
Watch your line or bobber for any movement.,
Set your hook gently.,
If you prefer, use a small lure or even a fly.,
Small spinner baits like Beetle Spins or Mimic Minnows will also catch bluegill, and by trolling these or drifting while you cast, you will cover a larger area in a shorter time, hopefully discovering a ""honey hole"", or a location where these fish congregate in numbers.

",How to Catch Bluegill,";
, Crickets are a great bait and very cheap at the local bait shop. Or try fresh bread. These fish love bread! Just mash it around the hook into a hard ball. You'll lose a few, but it's easy and fairly cheap. A good way to keep stale bread on the hook is to make a peanut-butter sandwich on 1 piece of bread, fold it in half, and tear off little pieces, mashing it onto and concealing the hook.

, You should already be out on the boat at sunrise.

, These fish can be very gentle biters at times, especially in cool weather, and with a nibble or two, your bait will be gone if you are not paying attention.

, The fish you expect on the other end of the line has a small, tender mouth, and jerking the line too hard will snatch the hook from the fish's mouth.

, Small, black or dark-colored ones work well. Bottom fishing (using several heavy sinkers close to the hook), drift fishing (for running water), or fly fishing are some options.

Find a “heavy duty” rod and a braided line.,
Buy the bait.,
Use a jig, if you are not using bait.,
Fish in cooler waters.,
Go deep.,
Find their feeding spots.,
Put the bait on your hook.,
Cast your line.,
Jerk the bait or jig slightly up and down to create movement.,
Hook your cod.,
Reel your cod in.",How to Catch Cod," The rod should be rated for fifty pounds or heavier.The preferred rod length is 6’6” to 7’6”.The reel should have a substantial diameter in order to handle the larger lures or bait that you will be using, as well as a heavier fishing line. Experienced cod fishers recommend using a rod that is classified as “fast” or “extra-fast.” This refers to the “action” of the rod, which in simple terms, refers to how much the rod will bend while you are reeling in your cod. Fast action rods bend much less, and only in the top third of the length. These are great for jig fishing, which will be explained in more depth later.Use a fifty pound braided line. Braided lines have less stretch than single lines, and they are extremely strong. It can support a larger amount of weight than regular fishing line, and a fish will not be able to break it easily., Cod can be pretty substantial and they’re also strong. When it comes to catching cod, tiny bait is not going to cut it. You should use squid, mussels, crab, or very large worms.Use live bait if possible. If not, use the freshest, highest quality bait available. Using a sinker, or a weight, in addition to the bait will help your bait reach the bottom.

, Jigging is a popular method to catch cod. A jig is a type of fishing lure that consists of a sinker and a covered hook. Like with bait, the jig requires a heavy sinker to reach the depths that cods inhabit., Cod is found must abundantly in the north Atlantic and Artic Oceans, in water from 32 degrees to 40 degrees Fahrenheit. In general, cod moves inshore during winter months and offshore during winter months, however their migratory patterns are not uniform among all populations., Cod are bottom-dwelling fish, so you won’t catch them near the surface of the water. Typically they inhabit depths of 200 to 1,300 feet.Because of their depth, it is typically easier to catch cod off a boat. If you are a recreational fisherman and do not have access to a boat, try to locate a spot where you can be directly above deep water, such as on a dock or pier., Cod feed mostly on animals that live on the sea floor, such as worms and crabs.Luckily, cod are also creatures of habit. If you catch cod feeding in one spot, you’re likely to find others there regularly. Take note of the spots where you find cod. While they do not form extremely dense schools like some fish, cod do congregate., When it comes to baiting, more is not necessarily better. Experienced cod fishers recommend using well-trimmed bait with only a bit hanging off the hook. Do not cover the barb of the hook with bait. By leaving it exposed, you will have an easier time hooking the cod.You can increase your chances of attracting cod by adding brightly-colored grubs to your hook. Grubs are small, soft lures that can move easily in water, which will attract fish., To do this, hold your rod at waist level, and adjust your hands so that you are holding the handle and line comfortably. Move your hands so that you have a thumb over the release button. When pressed, the line in your rod will stay in place. When you are not pressing it, the line is free to fly. Obviously, releasing the line is the most important part of casting!As you press the release button down, pull the rod back so that it is over your dominant shoulder. Then, quickly sweep the rod forward. As you do this, focus on your intended target. Once the tip of the rod is at eye level, release the button. The weight of the bait or jig will pull the line. Once the line has been fully released and you are satisfied with the depth of your hook, press the button again.Ensure that you have plenty of space behind you before casting. This requires a big range of motion and you will have a sharp hook on the end of your rod, so use caution to prevent hurting anyone or damaging anything.

, Do this once the bait or jig has dropped to the bottom and the line is tight. The movement can make the jig or bait look like a living creature, which will attract the cod., Once you feel a tug on the line, pull up your rod as much as needed to make sure your line is tight. Do not allow your line to go slack. In order to keep the line tight, reel in your line if the fish seems to be swimming toward you, and discontinue reeling if it swims in the opposite direction of you., First, lift your entire rod so the fish is being pulled toward you. After you’ve pulled the first toward you, lower the rod again slightly and begin reeling rapidly. Continue reeling quickly until the fish is close enough to get out of the water. As the fish fights against your line, it will tire itself out. It may be helpful to let it continue to fight and tire it out. Then get the cod close to the surface and scoop it up with a net, or just drag the fish onto surface if possible."

, Don't use fluorocarbon tippet it sinks and costs $12.00 a spool. The leader can be 7 1⁄2 or 9 feet (2.3 or 2.7 m).

,, Do not put your fly line or your leader down over them, though. They will spook. Place your fly where they can see it.

, Be ready for an immediate strike! Meanwhile, lower your rod tip to the surface and slowly bring in slack. Twitch the fly gently by light, short retrieves. This can bring a strike. Keep at it.

, Look for rises and cast nearby.

Tie a hook on to the end of your line using a regular clinch knot, multiple lines are an option though bullheads usually don't travel in schools.,
Put a split shot sinker on the line.,
Put the bobber a few feet above the hook usually.,
Bait the hook with something smelly!,
Cast out according to the season.,
Good Luck!

",How to Catch Bullhead Catfish," If you don't know the depth of your fishing area multiple hooks at different lengths are an option. Size 2 hooks are good for bullhead and you won't catch a sunny usually. If you do catch a sunfish, or any other fish, you can cut it into chunks.;
, Do not put too much weight as the fish might spit it out when it feels the pressure. Another option is a leader tied to a swivel with sliding weights set above the swivel

, Catfish are bottom feeders and it pays to remember so.

, Stink baits are good along with homemade dough bait. Also corn and worms work well. The thing to remember is that Catfish can't see well but have a better smell then bloodhounds. Smelly and meaty are good. Pieces of fish work too. Using minnows and frogs from the area works very well too as the fish have likely encountered that food source before and remember its scent.

, In spring Catfish are shallow, in summer deep, in fall anywhere really. Wait for a bite then jerk the rod. If the baits smell is enticing to the catfish, they will come to it so just wait patiently.

Choose the right bait.,
Don’t forget that both red snapper and gag grouper have pretty tight seasons and regulations.",How to Catch Big Snapper and Grouper in Pensacola Bay," Now days it’s not a big secret that Pensacola Bay is full of big red snapper and gag grouper. On top of that believe it or not you will often find larger fish in Pensacola Bay than you will find fishing shallow water near shore spots in the Gulf of Mexico.


It’s not a mystery why these fish have decided to call Pensacola Bay home; Pensacola Bay offers deeper water than you will find anywhere else. You will find depths that exceed sixty feet of water in Pensacola Pass and many areas with over fifty foot of water inside of Pensacola Bay.





;
, For many years this fishery was limited to anglers who were willing to go the extra mile to target these prized fish. There was no magical list of numbers floating around town or easily available online; also people who had these spots weren’t usually willing to share. You can keep a close eye on Pensacola fishing reports and know when the bite gets good.

, Don’t think for one second that because you’re fishing in the bay you should use light line or small rod and reel outfits. Your typical offshore bottom fishing outfit is what you want to use. You'll generally have very good luck using the high speed reels with jigging rods; your local tackle shop can definitely point you in the right direction for brands.

, Don’t consider using any type of line other than braid. Ordinarily fifty to eighty pound braid will get the job done, but every once in a while you may run across a grouper on a spot that will require you to use even heavier line.

, You want to use a combination of live and dead bait. A lot of different live baits will work, but you will likely find the best results using croakers and pigfish. Menhaden are usually the best dead bait to use and try doing different things with them like cutting the tail off or butter flying them.

, Currently red snapper season opens around the beginning of June each year and anglers are allowed to keep two snapper per person with a 16 inches (40.6 cm) minimum size limit. This year gag grouper season will open on the first of July and anglers may keep two fish per person over 22 inches (55.9 cm).

Shuffle your feet so that you do not scare away any sting rays or cause any to lash out.

,
Walk along the coast in a row, alternating a person with a gig and then a person with a lantern, a person with a gig, and then a person with a lantern, etc.

,
The lantern holders should hold their lantern close to the water.

,
Look for dark outlines that resemble round, flatfish.,
The closest gig holder needs to approach the outline and in one swift motion stab straight down into the middle of the figure.

,
If it is a stingray, it will definitely squirm violently.,

Once the fish is up at a visible surface, if you see that it is indeed a shark, have someone assist you with a net!

,
Be very careful with the net!,
Once the shark is subdued, you may chose to release it or keep it.

",How to Catch a Shark (in the Bay)2," When buying your bait, ask the shopkeeper where the best spots to catch sharks are in the area.

, Let out the anchor slowly until it hits the bottom if you do not want your boat to drift. Drifting is fine too.

,, Reel up about every five to seven minutes to make sure the bait is still there.

,, You may feel a tug, if so, wait until you feel another one, and when you do, give it a good yank!

Get the appropriate permits from the NMFS before you start fishing.

",How to Catch Bluefin Tuna," Place your bait at various depths to create an attractive setup, setting out the shallowest lines first and the deepest lines last so that the lines don't become tangled.;
,


Toss the pieces off of the transom until you have a visible chum click. Toss in new pieces every minute or so to keep the chum slick constant.
Make sure that your hooked baits are within the chum slick.

,, If you are finding fish at different depths than the depths at which you set your bait, then you may want to change your bait depth. A bluefin will be 20 to 30 feet (6 to 9 m) on your fish finder and will have a characteristic hump shaped like an upside-down ""V.""

, If you hear a pop, your rod is bent and line is stripping off of the reel at top speed, then you've probably hooked a bluefin.

, Keep the rod tip pointed at the fish.

, The rods can be stored in the cabin or in the opposite gunwale from the hooked line.

, Clear the deck as needed.

,, Steer the boat so that the line is 45 degrees aft and off of the gunwale.

, If the bluefin turns and starts to swim toward you, your line may go slack and fool you into believing that your catch got away. Reel as fast as you can to keep up with the fish and to restore the tightness of the line.

, After a few runs, the tuna will start to circle under your boat. Apply constant pressure to wear down your fish by inching the drag up and switching to a lower gear on your reel to bring the fish up toward the boat. Make sure that you pull the fish away from your engine so that your line doesn't get caught in the props.

, When your bluefin sees your boat, it may make another break for it.

, Aim to get the dart behind the fish's shoulder.

, Gaff the fish in the head and pull it against the boat to tail rope it., When the fish comes over the side of the boat, put your reel in free spool and keep your finger on the spool to keep the rod from loading up with the fish hits the deck.

, If your fish swallowed the hook, then cut your line to release the fish., Bluefins live in the Atlantic Ocean and spawn either in the Gulf of Mexico or in the Mediterranean Sea. Every spring, they migrate to the places where they were born.


As they travel back and forth between spawning grounds, they can be caught off of the North American coast, particularly in the Virginia/North Carolina area and off of Massachusetts, New Hampshire and southern Maine.
They also congregate in the Eastern Atlantic. Bluefins used to populate the Black Sea, although their population has dropped significantly here., You'll learn about the procedure and about the equipment that you'll need, and you'll learn whether or not the sport is for you. Look online to find charter cruises in your area, particularly around Cape Cod and Cape Hatteras.


Ask the captain whether you get to keep your catch (or if there is a weight limit) or if the fishing is catch and release.
Your catch, if you get to keep it, may not be something you can legally sell. Have a plan for what you're going to do with all of this fish--sushi, anyone?, Fishing regulations can be very confusing. Call 1-888-USA-TUNA for permits and to explore questions that you may have. Also, know your catch quota. Check with the NFMS for annual daily catch limits.

, Kite fishing allows an angler to keep a live bait swimming on the surface. The kite physically lifts the bait, and prevents the bait from swimming downward. The result is a live bait, virtually half out of the water, swimming and thrashing frantically on the surface-basically ringing the dinner bell for any tuna in the vicinity.

Go to the right location.,
Use the right techniques.,
Make sure you're in a good spot.,
Use strong lures.,
Use good quality line, traces, rods and reels.,
Handle the barra with care after you catch it.",How to Catch Barramundi," Barramundi or Asian Sea Bass are tropical fish, found in Indo-Pacific areas between Southern China and Australia. Barramundi fishing is thought to be Australia’s most iconic fishing, throughout the full northern coast of Australia. You can’t call yourself an Australian angler if you haven’t scored at least one ""barra"", for short, in your fishing career.


In Australia, several water reservoirs are stocked with barramundi for recreational fishing. Although among the anglers of Australia, the catch-and-release fishing for these “Impoundment barramundi” is extremely common, it’s way more exciting to fish them in their natural environment.;
, Barramundi respond well to a large array of lures and jigs. Therefore, jigging, popping, spooning are the most common strategies for catching them. The secret is to match your lure to the tiny fish barramundi are feed on - the prey of the barramundi - in that individual place. As a general plan, lures from silver to yellow, brown ought to produce some nice results.


Fly fishing for barramundi is common as well, in smaller rivers, and clear water where the fish can see the surface. Fly fishers typically use larger flies and nets.

, Find a good In general, to catch a barra, look for a deep spot, with a steep muddy or rocky riverside, with lots of vegetation, few trees, stumps, mangroves or bushes within the water, places wherever a barra may hide. Typically you'll see them at the surface, and in this case, clearly you must forged your lure or fly in their direction.

, The ultimate way to catch barramundi is on lures like some use live bait to catch fish but some do not consider this.


Lures are trolled or forged to possible places, which incorporates snags, rock bars, undercut watercourse banks, and coastal flats wherever bait is being sought by fish. Lure color and size are greatly debated. However there's little doubt that some days barramundi will show preference for certain lures and hues. From time to time the fish can kill a selected food item and a lure will have to imitate that item to get any strikes.
Assure the lures are sturdy. Luckily there's a large variety of strong lures obtainable specifically for barramundi fishing.The soft plastic lures or ""jellies"" are terribly effective.

, Using light line and tackle/equipment, not up to the task, only see’s big fish lost with lures/hooks still attached.Also with using light line and light rod/reel setups, the time taken to land a big barra is too long, many big fish are totally exhausted and near to death before even coming to the boat. A barra that is brought to the boat quickly is in much better health and less stressed.

, Once the barra is beside the boat decide whether you really have to remove it from the water to release it. Only remove barra from the water if you require a photo and ask yourself, ""Do I need to photograph every fish I catch or only the trophy size fish?""


Once you have decided to boat the fish, make sure that where you are going to place it isn't hot. This is best done by wetting the carpet, Truth Mat, or wherever you intend to lay the fish. Remember that on hot days even wet carpets can become hot again very quickly. Place your barra down and remove the lure as quickly as possible using a strong pair of bent nose pliers.
The best way to remove big barra from the water is with an extra large, knotless net.

Attach a steel leader to your line.,
Wear gloves.,
Choose your lure or bait.,
Handle the fish quickly and carefully.,
Remove the hook with pliers or special tools.,
Hold the fish underwater until it revives.",How to Catch and Release Blue Fish," Bluefish teeth can sever nylon fishing line. Attach a steel wire leader to the end of the line to protect it.
, Work gloves protect your hands from bluefish teeth and make it easier to handle the wire leader and fishing line without cutting yourself. Kevlar or other cut-resistant material is best, but any gloves are better than nothing., Bluefish are aggressive feeders willing to charge at just about any splashing surface lure. Big, teardrop-shaped lures work well in choppy water, but they must be reeled back immediately to keep them on the surface. Rely on pencil poppers instead in calm water, working them slowly across the surface.You can use squid, mullet, mackerel, or other saltwater fish as bait instead, especially if you do not see bluefish breaking the surface.When practicing catch and release, use only one hook at a time. Multiple hooks or multi-pronged hooks can be very difficult to extract without injuring the fish.
Bluefish are messy eaters that can rip apart the bait while missing the hook. Pierce the hook through the length of the bait, not just the head or tip., Fighting the hook can cause extreme exhaustion, and even a short time out of the water raises the fish's mortality rate. Bring the bluefish next to the boat as fast as possible. If you can, leave it in the water while you remove the hook. If you must lift it out of the water, wet your gloves, then lift the fish out with both hands supporting the head and base of the tail. If you want a photograph, have someone take one while you're removing the hook — the fish may not be able to afford extra posing time.

Never touch the gills of a fish during catch-and-release.
Dry hands or knotted nets rub off a layer of protective slime, leaving the fish vulnerable to infection., To avoid bites, always use long-handled hemostats, needle-nose pliers, or de-hooking tools instead, withdrawing the hook gently but quickly. The fish is much more likely to die if you rip out the hook, or if you take too long handling it out of the water.

If the hook is caught deep inside the fish, removing it is likely to injure internal organs. Just cut the line as close to the hook as possible, and leave it embedded in the fish. The mortality rate is still very high in these cases. Avoid feeding line to the fish after it bites, which can lead to this situation.Circle hooks are easy to remove and less likely to snag deep in the fish., If you lifted the fish out of the water, lower it back down gently; never throw it. Hold the fish underwater for about thirty seconds until it is ready to swim on its own.

If the fish's gills are barely moving, gently push the fish back and forth in the water so water flows over the gills. Release the fish once the gills are pumping vigorously."

Soak catfish overnight.",How to Catch a Pond Catfish," Catfish tend to be lured by smelly bait. When selecting the proper bait for your trap, opt for something that produces a strong odor. Some options include chad, chicken liver, night crawlers, and crawfish., Do you know roughly how big the catfish in your area tend to be? If not, ask other fishermen or look up information on your local Department of Natural Resources website. You can also try observing catfish in a nearby pond for a few days. Depending on the size of the catfish, you'll need a different sized reel.Light duty reels should be sufficient if the catfish in your area tend to be smaller. For larger catfish, go for a heavy duty reel.
If catfish in your area come in many different sizes, it may be a good idea to opt for heavy duty reel just to play it safe.

, You may not need a long rod when fishing for catfish in a pond. While it will not hurt, longer rods are usually better suited for catching catfish in streams. A shorter rod, less than six to eight inches, should work for catching catfish in a pond.When it comes to fishing line, go for 10 pound test line. This allows you to get the bait towards the bottom of a body of water. Catfish tend to hang out deep under the water.

, A sinker is a weight used to sink a fishing line. When catching catfish, always use the lightest weight sinker available. A lightweight sinker will allow the catfish to taste the bait without feeling the weight of the sinker. If your sinker is too heavy, a catfish will likely become suspicious and drop the bait., As you generally don't use things like worms to catch catfish, make sure your hooks have bait holders. The types of bait you'll be using, like crawfish or chicken liver, cannot be easily hooked onto a fishing rod., Location is vital to successfully catching catfish. Catfish tend to hangout in the deepest parts of the pond. Look for a hole or a dip in the ground underwater. You are also likely to find catfish near any obstruction in the pond, like a dam or a pile or rocks.If a creek feeds water into your pond, you're likely to find catfish here. There may be more food and vegetation near a creek, so catfish will congregate here in search of food.
Catfish tend to hide in lakes and ponds. If there is algae or other vegetation in your pond, catfish are likely to be found here.

, In a pond, it's easier for catfish to hear outside movement. When positioning yourself in the right location, try to be as quiet as possible. Walk slowly and keep your tackle box held close so it does not rattle around. Move delicately as you prepare your rod and bait. If a catfish hears too much motion, it will swim away., The tight line technique involves attaching a tiny weight to your line. This will allow your line to fall down deeper into the pond. Catfish are more likely to be found at the bottom of the pond. This will also make it easier for you to feel a pull when a catfish grabs onto your line., Catfish are more likely to be found at night. If it's feasible for you, try to fish during the nighttime. Make sure to bring a flashlight or lantern so you can find your way around the pond., Catfish can be very strong. When one does take your bait, it may provide a lot of resistance. Be prepared to pull on your rod hard, and use a lot of force when spinning your reel., When you pull a catfish out of the water, make sure you wear gloves. When frightened, catfish will squirm. You can easily get cut by a catfish's fin without proper protection., How you hold a catfish is important for safety. When removing the catfish from your line, wrap your hand around the fish behind the dorsal fin. The dorsal fin is the fin on top of a fish. Keep your fingers behind the gills and fins on the fish's side.You can use pliers to more easily remove the hook from a catfish.

, It's important you kill a catfish humanely shortly after capture. There are two main ways to kill a fish: stunning or spiking.To stun a fish, lay a forceful blow to its head using a blunt instrument. Aim above the eyes as this is where the brain is located. Occasionally, fish will not die on the first blow and may only be unconscious. It's a good idea to do a second blow, just to be safe.
If you have an ice pick or screwdriver handy, you can spike the fish. To do this, place the spike above the fish's eyes. Then, move the spike from side to side as this will destroy a fish's brain.

, Once the catfish is dead, immediately store it in ice. You should always bring a cooler containing ice with you when fishing for catfish. This will preserve the fish's freshness and flavor., You want to make sure your catfish are clean before cooking and eating them. To do so, you'll need to soak them overnight with salt and vinegar.Add enough water to a pot to cover your catfish. Then, add 1 tablespoon of salt and 2 tablespoons of vinegar.
Refrigerate the pot overnight. Rinse the fish under cool water in the morning before cooking it.

, Thermal underwear comes in light, mid, and expedition weights. The colder the conditions and the longer you plan on being out in them, the heavier you should go with.

, Cotton soaks up moisture, meaning that your clothes will get damp, uncomfortable, and may even cause you to catch a chill in cold weather once you start sweating. Cotton is not appropriate if you're hiking in rainy weather.

, Merino wool and some silk can accomplish this task, but specially designed synthetic fabrics may do the most thorough job of it. Look for athletic wear that specifically advertises ""wick-away"" capabilities.

, Like your base layers, choose synthetic or wool socks to wick away moisture, which can be a cause of blisters. Whether or not you choose a thin or thick sock is a matter of personal preference with a consideration to the outdoor temperatures. In cold wintry weather choose a thick, warm sock. In humid summer weather a thin sock will do.


Some people find that layering socks or wearing a thin liner sock under a thicker sock prevents blisters.

, Layering is especially important for cold weather hiking. As you warm up, you can remove some of the layers to prevent yourself from overheating. When you need the extra warmth, you can put the layers back on.

, Your skin needs to breathe, and overheating can cause a variety of health problems. Some people prefer hiking skirts or kilts for even more ventilation. If you want to avoid insects or sun exposure, wear long sleeves and pants made of the most breathable, lightweight material you can find.

, Long sleeves and long pants are just the start. Vests, jackets, and tights are also important tools you can use to keep yourself warm.

, Polyester fleece is a popular option because it is lightweight and breathable. Merino wool and goose down are also common choices, but goose down must be kept dry to remain effective.


There are new kinds of down that are water-resistant.

, A basic waterproof exterior keeps you dry during mild to moderate precipitation, regardless of the temperature outside. A fleece interior keeps you warm during the winter, and selecting a removable interior makes it easier to adapt the jacket to warm weather use.

, Windbreakers prevent you from catching a chill on a breezy day, but they do not provide much insulation for more extreme conditions.

, Waterproof shells are designed to carry your perspiration from the inside of your jacket out, while simultaneously preventing large drops of precipitation from finding their way inside the jacket. These jackets are the most useful, but they also tend to be the most expensive.

, These jackets are less expensive than their waterproof counterparts. Tightly woven fabric blocks out wind and light rain, but it will soak through in heavy downpours.

, Even if your base and mid layers are heavily insulated, your outer layer still needs to provide you with additional warmth.

, Non-breathable shells are generally very durable and waterproof, but they trap your body heat inside and prevent your skin from breathing. As a result, you risk overheating or getting chilled from being damp.

, Hoods, pockets, and vents are all useful, but they also drive up the price of a jacket. If you plan on hiking seriously, however, you should invest in a hooded jacket with plenty of pocket space and zipper vents that can regulate your temperature.

, Hiking boots are appropriate for simple and advanced hikes because they provide your foot with good support and protect you from ground-level hazards like thorns and snake bites. Whether or not you want to select a low top or high-top boot is a matter of personal preference. Pick out a pair with waterproofing to keep your feet dry if you will be hiking in wet terrain. Realize that waterproof boots are less breathable in warm conditions.

, Hiking shoes or trail runners provide you with enough support for even terrain and give you the flexibility you need for hikes that also include some basic rock climbing. Look for hiking shoes with strong, secure grips.

, If you plan on hiking in the cold, an insulated cap prevents you from losing too much body heat through your head. If you plan on hiking in warm weather, bring a brimmed hat that can shield your face and neck from the sun.

, The best gloves are waterproof with a separate cloth interior. A neck gaiter can also provide extra warmth.

, Back packs are best for cold weather, since they offer enough room for you to carry extra layers of clothing along with water and food. Fanny packs are suitable for warm weather, when you do not need to worry about storing extra layers of clothing but still need to carry water and snacks.

Disassemble the parts and air dry.",How to Clean a Camelbak Bladder1," The water needs to be hot, but not boiling, as this can damage the bladder. Mix the ingredients until they are well combined.For example, if your Camelbak bladder holds 2 liters (8.45 cups) of water, then mix ½ cup (118.3 ml) of baking soda with 1 ½ cups (354.8 ml) of water.
You may also add ¼ cup (59.15 ml) of white vinegar to the solution. If you do, the vinegar will react with the baking soda, making the solution fizz. Wait until the solution stops fizzing before pouring it into the bladder.;
, Then shake it for 30 seconds. Let the solution set for five minutes.If you added vinegar, open the main valve (away from your face) to let any built-up pressure escape.

, This will allow the solution to flow into the tube and mouthpiece. Lay the bladder on its back and let the solution set for 30 minutes. Pour the solution out after 30 minutes.Make sure the hose is facing away from your face when squeezing the bite valve.

, Use a scrub brush or a sponge to clean the bladder. For the tube, use a pipe cleaner-like scrub brush. Scrub away baking soda and other residue from the bladder and tube.You can buy scrub brushes from your local hardware store, or you can purchase the Camelback Cleaning Kit which includes brushes.

, Mix 3/4 teaspoon (3.7 ml) of mild soap with ¾ cup (177 ml) of water per liter volume. Pour the soap solution into the bladder and shake it for 30 seconds.

Once the tablet has dissolved, shake the bladder for 30 to 40 seconds in order to diffuse the cleaning solution.You can purchase hydraulic cleaning tablets online.
Alternatively, you can use denture tablets instead of the hydraulic cleaning tablets., Pinching the bite valve will allow the cleaning solution to flow into the tube and mouthpiece. Once the solution is in the tube and mouthpiece, let it set for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, poor the solution out., Mix 3/4 teaspoon (3.7 ml) of a mild soap with ¾ cup (177 ml) of water per liter volume. Pour the soapy solution into the bladder. Pinch the bite valve again to allow the soapy solution to travel into the tube and mouthpiece.Shake the bladder for 30 seconds and then pour out the solution.

, Use a pipe cleaner-like scrub brush to scrub the inside of the hose. Then use a bigger scrub brush or sponge to clean the inside of the bladder.Scrub both the tube and bladder until any and all residue is gone.

, Rinse until all the soap is completely removed; you may need to rinse it two to three times. Then take the disassembled parts to a well-ventilated area, like an outside patio or the bathroom, to air dry.You may need to insert a wand-like object into the bladder’s entrance to keep it propped open so it can dry thoroughly.

Get the proper equipment.,
Research local fishing conditions.,
Update your fishing license, or get one.,
Decide if you want to rent a boat at the lake or river, or fish from shore.,
Drive or walk to the lake with the equipment, bait, and safety gear.,
Rent the needed items.,
Get rigged up.",How to Catch a Rock Bass1," This usually means getting a rod, reel, and some fishing line to spool on.


In addition to this, you'll need a lure. Most pan-fishermen prefer using a small 1/16 oz. jig, that is tipped with a red worm, wax worm, or piece of nightcrawler. Most rock bass will take nightcrawler, but it is also good to try spinners and spoons;
, You can Google local fishing conditions, or you may be able to find a fishing report on the web page of your state's Natural Resources or Fish & Game department.


Look for lakes, ponds, or rivers close to where you live.

, You can be fined and ticketed for fishing without a permit. It is very important that you have one, and that fishing is legal in your area.

, There usually is the same amount of action on shore that there is in a boat. If you want to go on a wider search for these fish, a boat is always recommended.

, The lake may offer safety gear (life vests, flotation devices, etc.) for a small fee. By law, those safety features are required if in a boat.

, This means rent the boat for a period of time, buy the bait, or buy ""dock-space"".

, Spool the line onto the reel, string the rod, tie your hook, and put the bait on the hook.

"
Start the motor.,
Go out to where you plan to fish.,
Start to cast around.,
Set the hook as soon as you feel a bite.,
Land your fish.",How to Catch a Rock Bass2," Be sure you know how, and read the safety information before you set out.

, You should try different spots, and remember to ask around. It also helps to have a fish finder or underwater camera.


If it is the summer, rock bass can be found on gravel or on rock bars in about 6–15 feet (1.8–4.6 m) of water.
If it is fall, the rock bass will be in about the same depth water, and in thicker vegetation or along a deeper rock stretch.

, You should have a slower jigging motion, but it should be constant if you are using a jig. If you are using a small spoon, its best to let the spoon drop to the bottom and jerk it up while you retrieve. Either way, the motion should be relatively constant.

, Make sure you don't set it too hard, or you can rip the hook out of the fish's mouth.

, Usually, you can just flip the fish into the boat, but it does help to carry around a small net, just in case.

"
"
Look off the dock to spot any signs of fish.,
Cast out and let the worm sit at the bottom.,
Watch your line for signs of nibbling.,
Set the hook when the fish bites.,

Keep something to put the fish in.,
Clean any fish you kept at a cleaning station.",How to Catch a Rock Bass3," Some signs include spawning beds, weeds, gravel, or even the fish themselves.


Try to locate a drop-off from the dock. If you are fishing at night, this can be key to catching big fish.

, By doing this, fish that are nearby will spot the moving worm on the bottom as they swim.


If you are using a small spoon, its best to let the spoon drop to the bottom and jerk it up while you retrieve.

, Usually, curious fish will nibble the end of the worm to see what it is. You can see the vibrations in the line if a fish nibbles.

, Make sure you don't set it too hard, or you can rip the hook out of the fish's mouth.

, Usually, you can just flip the fish onto the dock, but it does help to carry around a small net, just in case.

, It's good to have your stringer or live-basket handy, just in case you want to keep some fish. Some people also like to put their fish into coolers while on the boat.


Make sure the fish are completely in the water while on the stringer.

,


This easier because the people who work at the lake will sometimes clean the fish for you.
It is also easier because you can just wrap up the fish instead of driving home with fish smell in your car.

Take stock of the camping gear that you already have, as well as the type of gear you will need to bring along on specific trips.,
Consider the types of trips you are likely to take with your camping backpack.,
Decide on a price range that you can afford before you begin shopping.,
Bring your largest camping items to the store with you, such as your tent, sleeping bag, and sleeping pad.,
Decide what is more important to you: a backpack that is lightweight or a backpack that will be heavier, but that provides maximize comfort, space, and convenience.,
Try on the backpacks that you have selected based on your camping needs, and make sure to choose one that fits.",How to Choose a Camping Backpack,"


If you have older, bulkier camping items, you will need to look for a larger camping backpack with greater storage capacity. Newer camping gear is much lighter and more compact than the older models. If your camping gear is fairly new, you will be able to take a more manageable-sized pack.
If you intend to go on trips where bears are present, make sure extraneous bulky items such as a bear canister to protect your food will fit into your pack while leaving room for your other supplies.;
,


If you plan to take shorter trips lasting one to three nights, you can get by with a smaller camping backpack than if you were to take a longer trip. Backpacking manufacturers call smaller packs Multi-day or Weekend Trip packs. They generally hold between 40 and 75 liters, with women's packs generally having a maximum capacity of 65 liters (17.2 US gal).
If longer trips of 5 or more days are in your future, a pack classified as an Extended Trip pack will be necessary to accommodate all of your gear, as they generally hold over 65 liters (17.2 US gal) of content. Furthermore, this type of pack is appropriate if you will be traveling with children and carrying their gear, or if you are camping in cold weather months for more than one night. This type of pack can carry extra supplies required for extremely cold temperatures.
If you plan to take some shorter trips and some longer trips, but only want to buy one backpack, your best choice is to select the larger pack designed for extended trips. That way, no matter what length trip you are going on, you will have enough space for your survival essentials and can avoid strapping things to the outside of your pack. Gear on the outside of your pack may snag on branches along the hiking path.

, This will help you and the salesperson narrow in on an appropriate pack more quickly.

Researching camping backpacks by price and size ahead of time will help you know brand names, price ranges and other factors that would help you make your decision when it comes to exactly what you can afford in a backpack.

,


Try fitting these items into the various camping backpacks available in the store to get an idea for how large of a bag you will need. Make sure there is enough room left for your other camping essentials, such as food, cooking and eating supplies, and clothing.

,


Camping backpacks range from ultra lightweight, which trade convenience to minimize weight, up to deluxe, which adds in comfort and space but that will be heavier. Lightweight backpacks fall somewhere in the middle and are a popular choice.

,


You should base fit off of whether it is appropriate for your torso length rather than overall height, and whether it fits snugly around your hips. Ask a salesperson to help you determine your torso length and hip size, then look at backpack specs to find one appropriate for your size.

Splurge on boots.,
Wear a pair of wool socks over a pair of polypropylene liner socks.,
Wear shorts/pants according to season but try to avoid cotton and opt for polyester.,
Bring at least a long-sleeved shirt.,
Consider the weather.",How to Dress for a Backpacking Trip," When allocating your backpacking budget, boots should be your first priority. A good pair of boots is expensive, but there are a few reasons you should spend money on them.


First off, a good pair of boots is usable in many situations other than backpacking. If you decide at some point that backpacking isn't for you, you can still use them for tramping through snow to work or school, yard work, wood working, construction, camping, hiking, or any time your feet need protecting. A good pair of boots allows you to do a wide range of things safely, and it's good to have one around. Secondly, if you take care of them and don't lose them, a good pair of boots will last you 10+ years.
The most important quality of a backpacking boot is that it fit well. When walking downhill your feet shouldn't slide forward much. If they do, the tips of your toes are going to be hurting from banging into the front of your boots. When walking uphill, your heels shouldn't slide up much. If they do, you are likely to end up with blistered heels from the rubbing back and forth. Secondly, the boots should cover your ankles with stiff material. You should still be able to make circles with your foot, but it should be nearly impossible for you to roll your ankles. Some people prefer a lower top boot, but unless you are also investing in trekking poles this is probably not safe. Thirdly, the boot should have a thick sole that will keep you from feeling bumps underneath it and will grip rocks.
Look for boots with very few seams. This is for two reasons: waterproofing and durability. Treated leather repels water well on its own, but more seams make more opportunities for water to get in, and make it more difficult to waterproof the boot. You'll inevitably slip into a stream at some point, and a well waxed boot with a high top will minimize the amount of water sloshing around your feet for the rest of the day. The two things that wear out first on a boot are the seams and the soles. Boots can be resoled, and seams can be glued, but the boot will last longer if there are fewer seams to begin with.
Break in your new pair of boots. When you buy a new pair of boots, don't immediately take them out on the trail. The boots will take some time to conform to your feet even if they fit well, so break them in ahead of time. Wear them instead of your normal shoes for the week prior to the trip. If you are going on a long trip with them, take them out for a weekend trip beforehand. This helps to prevent blisters and can also catch any manufacturing flaws early.;
, Don't wear cotton. The wool and polypropylene will keep your feet dry and cushioned. The liners will absorb most of the friction of your foot moving around and help prevent blisters. You'll need 2 pairs each of these for a weekend, 3-4 for a longer trip. If you hike a day in cotton socks they'll end up as a moist, pulpy, off-white, smelly mass, and you'll probably have blisters.

, The evenings can get much colder in the countryside than in the cities, and much colder than that when you are up in the mountains. As such, it's good to have a pair of long pants with you even in the middle of summer if you are going to be at any elevation. For shorts, a pair of mesh running shorts will do. Shorts are there mostly to provide a little bit of sun protection. Don't bring jeans. They are heavy, bulky, and they will never dry.

, Avoid cotton. It dries slowly, and is useless for warmth when it is wet. Fleece, wool, polypropylene, or any synthetic fabric work great. For colder weather, the key for warmth is to dress in layers. This allows you to regulate your temperature over the course of the day. The clothes that make you comfortable when you are standing still will be too warm when you are walking. The clothes that keep you comfortable at camp in the afternoon will be too cold once the sun goes down.

, Under rain or wind, the most economical option is a nylon poncho. They are effective, lightweight, and very cheap. For summer backpacking, you probably don't need to use anything else. Ponchos are not as useful in wind, so find one with snaps along the side. For winter backpacking you're better off with a raincoat and rain pants. With a poncho your arms and calves will get wet, and this is more of an issue in the winter.

"
"
Consider what kind of weather you will hike in.,
Be flexible.,
Remove most layers for warm rain.,
Consider a rain hat for both warm and cold rain.,
Consider rain pants for both warm and cold rain.,
Buy good boots for rain.,
Use a poncho for emergencies.",How to Choose Good Rain Gear for Hiking," Is it going to be warm or cold rain? Will there be snow also? Warm rain requires water protection without warmth. Cold rain and/or snow requires both water and heat protection.;
, Bring various layers to protect from rain and cold, but not plain cotton. For cold weather, begin with a thin thermal layer in a synthetic fabric or silk. Then add light wool or fleece, and top it with a heavy Gore-Tex or similar jacket with hood.

, Start with a light synthetic layer that will remove sweat from your skin, and add the lightest nylon shell for water protection. Pit zippers (under the arms) allow your body to breathe while working up a sweat in the rain.

, Especially for warm rain, a wide-brimmed hat may be enough with a light shell. Be sure the hat is a fast-drying fabric like nylon or water-resistant cotton. Even for cold rain, a hat on top of your hood may help to drip rain away from your face.

, These nylon pants work well over light shorts in warm rain, since you will sweat. For cold rain or snow, add them over the other layers as on top: wicking long underwear, fleece pants, and rain pants. Do not wear jeans as they dry slowly and get heavy.

, Hiking boots with a Gore-Tex layer and high tops (at the ankle or higher) are good for swollen streams, puddles, snow, and mud. Add two layers of socks, liners, and thicker woolen trekking socks. For warm rain, the boots are still critical, but you may wear a lighter hiking sock over liners.

, Carry one in your day pack and you can always use it if you are caught without anything else.

Remove the laces and insoles.,
Brush off dirt deposits.,
Scrub your boots with water and mild dish detergent.,
Wipe away the soap.,
Throw your boots in the freezer to remove sap.,
Spray the boots with a waterproofing compound while they’re damp.,
Apply a leather, nubuck, or suede conditioner.,
Treat hardware with chrome polish.,
Dry your boots out of direct sunlight.,
Avoid drying your boots near a heat source.,
Put your boots away only when they’re completely dry.",How to Clean Hiking Boots," Insoles can collect lots of moisture, so you should remove them before you start to clean your boots. Sprinkling them with baking soda will help dry them and remove odors. Additionally, taking out the laces will make it easier to clean and polish the lace holes and metal hardware.To clean your laces, rinse them with warm water and dish soap, then leave them out to dry.;
, Use a stiff nylon shoe brush to remove any caked dirt from your shoes’ surfaces. In a pinch, you can also use damp paper towels to remove accumulated dirt.








If your boots have stubborn salt stains, soak them in water for an hour or two., Warm water and a mild dish soap should be enough to remove most grime and stains from your boots. Scrub with a soft cloth or, for stubborn stains, a soft bristled brush. If your boots are suede, use gentle pressure so you don’t damage the material.








Use a toothbrush to scrub hard to reach nooks and crannies.
Try using a pencil eraser to remove any scuffs that don’t come off with dish detergent., After scrubbing, rinse your cloth under warm water to wash out soapy residue, or just grab a new wet cloth. Use the wet cloth to wipe soap off of the boots.









When the cloth gets soapy, rinse it under running water, squeeze it out, then continue wiping the boots until you've sopped up all the soap.

, For pesky gunk like sap, wax, or gum, put your boots in a freezer bag and place them in the freezer. Keep them inside for an hour or two, or until the sticky spot has hardened. Once it’s frozen, you can easily remove it using a blunt knife or nail file., After cleaning, the surface pores of hide-based boots (leather, suede, and nubuck) will open, making them more receptive to water. To close and protect them, you should apply a waterproofing spray labelled for their specific material.








Spray them while they’re still damp to best impregnate the material and prevent future water absorption.
Waterproof your boots whenever you wash them. To keep them in the best shape, give them a spray the day before you go hiking.

, After waterproofing your hide-based boots, you should apply a cream or conditioner, such as a silicone-based protectant, to help retain moisture. Use a care product labelled for your boots’ specific material. Apply the product to your boots just after waterproofing, as the boots should be damp when you condition them.








While too much moisture is bad for hide-based boots, the right amount will help prevent them from wearing or cracking.
It's best to condition your leather boots whenever you wash and waterproof them. Just don't apply too much conditioner at one time, or your boots will become too soft., Hardware, such as the metal around your boots’ lace holes, is prone to rusting. You can remove and prevent rust by using a cotton swab to apply a chrome polish. Apply the polish, let it sit, then wipe off excess with a dry cloth.







, Choose an open, well-aired location to air dry your boots. To prevent cracking and discoloration, find a spot out of direct sunlight.








Try sprinkling baking soda and placing crumpled newspaper inside the boots to help them dry out and remove odors. Replace the newspaper whenever it becomes damp.

, Never use heat sources like radiators, dryers, blow dryers, or an oven to dry your boots. Intense heat will cause irreversible damage to hide-based fibers, and your boots will end up dried, cracked, and ill-fitting.The hot sun will have the same effect as a radiator or dryer, so avoid leaving your boots outside to dry.

, Once they’re completely dry, re-lace them and replace the insoles, then store them in a shoe bag or box. Storing damp or wet boots promotes mold growth, so let your boots air dry for at least 24 hours. 








Try not to leave your boots in the car after using them, or you’ll end up with moldy, stained boots.

But there might be no perfect knife for for everyone. The survival knife which might be perfect for one might not prove perfect for the other.When going in to the wild, you should know up front what you could come across. A knife that can meet these needs will make your experience more easy, and in some situations, save your life. (For example, an axe is considered a very useful tool in the California or Canadian woods. But a machete in a jungle environment is better suited to cut through the dense jungle foliage. Finding a knife that can meet both needs halfway could come in handy). For example you have to decide getting the best survival knife or trekking knife which can be used for multiple applications and are easy to carry in your bug out bag.;
, When choosing a knife to take with you you should keep in mind how easy it will be for you to carry. Some knives can be kept in your with a clip on bar. But some others will required for you to obtain a sheath to attach it to your belt, vest or pack. Remember, having the knife easy to access for you is ideal.

, Many knife manufacturers have a large variety and styles of knives that usually vary on price as well. Always beware of cheap priced knives as the quality of these can be so poor that they will fail you when you least expect it. But just because a knife is simple, it doesn't mean it is of poor quality (Such knives, like tanto blade knives are known for their simplicity but their reliability). But just as well, beware of overly priced knives that claim great quality and craftsmanship. Just because they claim to be used by survival experts, military groups or simply because of their brand name, you shouldn't spend hundreds of dollars on a knife that would meet the same requirements as a $50 knife with the same durability and reliability. (Ka-Bar knives are known for their strength and history, at a much affordable prices)

, Different blades are made of different materials. Most small, pocket sized or tanto boot knives are made of 440 steel. These is an affordable, light and decently strong metal for knives, that is known for it's light weight, sharpness, and that it takes a long time to rust. Other, much larger and heavier knives are usually made of 1080 (or higher grade number) steel. These knives hold their blade much better and longer. They are good for heavier task, like wood cutting or small game hunting. Many large 7 inch (17.8 cm) Ka-Bar or SOG knives are made of this material and are historically known for their reliability. But beware. These material makes them much more prone to rust easy over time, because of the high amount of carbonation the metal is put through. So keep them away from moisture, preferably on nylon sheaths.

, Just because a knife looks like Rambo's knife doesn't mean is the best to carry on your back for weeks to come. A knives handle can make a huge difference. Clip knives are often used for small, quick activities, because the clip makes it uncomfortable to handle over time and can create blisters in your hands. (just imagine building shelter in the rain while using a clip pocket knife). Larger knives can come with rubber grips, which makes it more suitable for wet environments than leader grip knives. A knife has to feel good in your hand, even if it is for a minute or for hours. (weight can make a difference as well. Heavier knives can cut through wood better, but lighter knives might make it easier to carry on load trips). Gerber knives are known for their comfort.

, Think of the many things you can or will do with the knife you choose. From opening cans to cutting through rope or vegetation, or even unscrewing things. All of these should be things you have to keep in mind when you decided what knife to carry. Many people prefer to carry a single multi-tool knife instead of a single blade knife, as this can be lighter, more compact and can be your one everything stop. But others, like hunters who expect to skin animals or kill small game, and some who will find themselves in more remote areas who expect to cut through wood for fires, or to make their own shelter, usually take much heavier knives that can take much heavier and tougher treatment.

, Just readying one or two articles or reviews on a couple of knives would not give you a good idea of what kind of knife makes the best match for you. read as many reviews as you can, form the goods to specially the bad ones, as these can give you a better understanding of the complications a certain knife can give you. Many web forums in which people discuss their experience with the knives they have purchased and used. Specially if they are written by known or respected knife experts. Also considered going to knife stores in your are. Look around, as a good quality knife can be found on almost any store even if you don't expect it. Stores dedicated to knives only tend to know a lot about knives and can give you advice on how to take care of it and what kind of sheath you could use, but beware, because they tend to overprice the knives tends of dollars than some other chain stores. (Target carries a good variety of Gerber knives for example)

, Expect your knife to fail or not to meet your expectation on your first try. Be prepared to go through a couple of knives until you know what style, size and material is the best suited for you. Many experienced campers and hunter carry at least two knives, a large or main knife, and a smaller tanto or clip knife as a backup.

Select a backpacking sleeping bag rated for temperatures you anticipate during your trip.,
Choose a gender-specific sleeping bag.,
Pick a backpacking sleeping bag with a low weight.,
Consider the size of the sleeping bag.,
Evaluate the shape of the backpacking sleeping bag.,
Determine the type of insulation you prefer.,
Choose a sleeping bag with a waterproof outer shell.,
Select a sleeping bag with features ideal for backpacking.,
Compare prices between sleeping bags.",How to Choose a Sleeping Bag for Backpacking," Prior to 2009, each sleeping bag manufacturer had its own temperature rating system. However, in 2009, many manufacturers adopted the European Norm (EN) 13537 testing methodology, so now temperature ratings are more consistent across sleeping bag brands. There are 4 general categories of EN sleeping bag temperature ratings. The ratings are calculated based on users wearing 1 layer of clothing and a hat, and utilizing an insulated pad under the sleeping bag.


Choose a summer season backpacking sleeping bag for temperatures above 35 degrees F (1.6 degrees C).
Select a 3-season sleeping bag for temperatures between 10 and 35 degrees F (-12.2 and 1.6 degrees C).
Pick a cold weather sleeping bag for temperatures between -10 and 10 degrees F (-23.3 and -12.2 degrees C).
Choose a winter or extreme sleeping bag for temperatures below -10 degrees F (-23.3 degrees C).
Select a sleeping bag with a temperature rating slightly lower than the coldest temperature you expect to experience for non-EN rated bags. For example, if you anticipate freezing temperatures, choose a bag that is rated for 20 degrees F (-6.6 degrees C), not 35 degrees F (1.6 degrees C). The 35 degree F (1.6 degrees C) rating is only intended to keep users comfortable at temperatures above 35 degrees F (1.6 degrees C).;
, EN 133537 testing revealed that women are colder when they sleep than men. Look for temperature ratings based on your gender.


Look for the EN Comfort Rating for women. This rating indicates the lowest outside temperature in which the average woman can sleep comfortably using the sleeping bag.
Consider the EN Lower Limit Rating for men. This rating indicates the lowest outside temperature in which the average man can sleep comfortably using the sleeping bag.
Choose an EN Extreme rating for either gender. The EN rating indicates the lowest outside temperature in which the average person can stay alive using the sleeping bag. This rating should only be considered for extreme temperatures. It does not take comfort into consideration, but only focuses on survival.

, Because the sleeping bag will be carried on your back, opt for a bag that has the lowest possible weight, but still provides necessary warmth and comfort. Look for sleeping bags that weigh less than 4 or 5 pounds, or 10 to 20 percent of your pack weight.

, Most manufacturers offer backpacking sleeping bags specifically designed for men or women.


Determine the size of a women's sleeping bag based on your height. Women's bags come in 2 sizes: regular for women up to 5 feet (1.5 m), 6 inches tall (168 cm); and long for women 5 feet (1.5 m), 7 inches to 6 feet (1.8 m) tall (170 to 183 cm). Women's bags are designed differently from men's in that they are narrower at the shoulders, wider at the hips and may have extra insulation in the foot box, which is at the bottom of the sleeping bag near the feet.
Select a men's sleeping bag based on your height. Men's bags come in 3 sizes: short for men up to 5 feet (1.5 m), 6 inches tall (168 cm); regular for men 5 feet (1.5 m), 7 inches to 6 feet (1.8 m) tall (170 to 183 cm); and long for men 6 feet (1.8 m), 1 inch to 6 feet (1.8 m), 6 inches tall (185 to 198 cm). Some brands offer extra long sizes for men up to 6 feet (1.8 m), 8 inches tall (203 cm).

, All sleeping bags made specifically for backpacking are mummy-shaped.


Consider a sleeping bag with narrow shoulder and hip specifications for increased warmth and decreased weight. Depending on your body shape, these narrow bags may be restrictive and uncomfortable.
Consider a mummy bag with larger shoulder and hip specifications for increased comfort. While these sleeping bags may provide more comfort, they are typically bulkier and heavier than the narrower bags.

, Sleeping bag insulation or ""fill"" reduces the amount of heat your body loses while you are sleeping. There are 2 main types of fill: down or synthetic.


Choose down fill for lightweight durability. Down, which comes from geese and ducks, is a natural fiber that is breathable and durable. Its light, compressible nature makes it ideal for backpacking sleeping bags. However, down sleeping bags typically cost more than synthetic bags and lose their insulating ability when they get wet.
Select synthetic fill for comfort in damp conditions. Synthetic fill is usually made of polyester and comes in 2 insulation categories. Short-staple fills are densely packed to reduce heat loss and are compressible for backpacking. Continuous-filament fills are thicker and less compressible than short-staple fills, but are more durable. Synthetic fill retains warmth even in wet weather. Synthetic sleeping bags are usually heavier than down bags, but they are non-allergenic and less expensive.

, Look for sleeping bag shells that are treated with a durable water repellent (DWR) finish. This will allow water to bead up on your sleeping bag and serve as a barrier to the fabric insulation.

,


Choose a backpacking sleeping bag with a built-in hood. The hood, which can be cinched with a drawstring, prevents heat loss through your head.
Consider a sleeping bag with a draft tube, which keeps heat from escaping along the bag's zipper.
Pick a sleeping bag with a stash pocket for small items like glasses, watches or cell phones.
Find a backpacking sleeping bag with pad loops so you can attach the bag to your sleeping pad. This will prevent your sleeping bag from rolling off of the pad.

, Sleeping bags for backpacking are available at retail and sporting good stores, camping suppliers and online. They range in price from around $100 to more than $800. Evaluate how often you will use your sleeping bag before making an investment. If you are on a tight budget, consider purchasing a used sleeping bag.

Get a good pair of boots.,
Do some training.,
Get a hiking buddy.,
Get some gear.,
Find some Hikes to do.,
Dream Big.",How to Begin Hiking," This allows you to take yourself further than wearing trainers or flat soled shoes. A reliable, sturdy and supportive boot is best. Also make sure your boots are right for the environment you will be using them in (For example, a pair of heavy duty waterproof boots are a bad choice for desert hiking). Your boots should be suited to you and your environment.;
, If you can't walk up a small hill without tiring then you won't make it up that really big mountain standing between you and success. No, a good hiker is one with good strength, stamina and the will to carry on in any conditions. Develop these quality's, and you will be hiking like a pro in no time.

, Find a friend who has a similar fitness level and has the same love of hiking as you do. They must be willing, as good as you at hiking and be good company. A really boring person with nothing interesting to talk about isn't very good!

, You don't have to go all out and get very expensive kit at all. Your going to need some lightweight pants and a t-shirt, a fleece and a waterproof jacket(depending on time of year etc) and a small day sack to put stuff in. Take lots of snacks and water, drink regularly and keep yourself hydrated. A map and compass are useful but a GPS of some sort can also come in handy (but don't rely on gadgets,they can always run out of charge when you need them most).

, Start out small and local and as you build up your strength go bigger and bigger! A three mile hike up a nearby hill is a good start, and keep going bigger and further.

, Eventually you will be able to tackle the tallest peaks, the longest distances and the toughest terrain.

Decide between buying 2 hiking poles or a single hiking staff.,
Decide which of the following features are most important to you.,
Size your pole.",How to Buy a Hiking Pole,"


A hiking staff is usually, but not always, longer than hiking poles. It provides only 1 point of balance, but, likewise, only 1 object to carry or strap to your backpack when not in use.
If you carry trekking poles, you have the option of loaning 1 to a friend.;
,


Shock absorbers: On most hiking poles and staffs, you can turn the shock absorber off by pressing down on the handle and twisting.
Adjustability: Collapsible or telescoping hiking poles and staffs pack down small enough not to stick out to the sides when you strap them to the outside of your backpack. You can also adjust the poles to fit hikers of different heights, or to help keep you steady when side hilling, or going uphill or downhill.
Hand strap or no hand strip? This is purely a matter of personal preference.
Material: Aluminum is strong and cheap, but heavy; carbon fiber is lighter but more expensive. Aluminum can bend under stress; carbon fiber is more likely to break.
Grip material and size: Foam, cork and rubber are your most common grip material choices. The grip may be just large enough to accommodate your hand, or extend further down the pole.
Baskets: on many trekking poles, these can be swapped out; use large baskets for hiking in mud or snow, and smaller baskets when hiking through brush or in everyday conditions.

,


Your hand should rest comfortably on the grip with your arm at your side, elbow bent at 90 degrees.
If the poles are adjustable, lock the adjusting mechanism in place (this is usually done by rotating half of the pole) and lean on the poles; they shouldn't buckle or give beneath your weight.

Consider waterproof boots.",How to Buy Hiking Boots," Trail shoes are lightweight hiking shoes that look much like a sneaker or walking shoe, except more rugged. They are fine for mild to moderate hiking where you are going to stay on a trail that doesn't climb much. If you're just an occasional hiker, this shoe should be enough for you. Nonetheless, if you plan to do more serious hiking or even if you just need to have more ankle support, you may need to move up a level.If you're a runner, another light option is trail runners, which have softer soles but provide good traction.;
, Hiking boots generally have more solid soles than hiking shoes, plus they usually come up to ankle height to provide support for your ankle. However, they do come in different weights, each of which is appropriate for different occasions.Lightweight hiking boots work best on fairly easy trails. You should also only use these when you have a fairly light load that you're carrying.While these boots do provide more ankle support, they usually only have an ankle collar, which doesn't provide as much support as sturdier boots.

, Both mid-weight and heavyweight boots offer more ankle support, a stronger sole, and better protection from the trail. This type of boot is the more traditional style hiking boot, and you should choose it for rough trails and off trails. You should also pick one of these if you're carrying a heavy load.Keep in mind that the sturdier your boot is, the longer it will take to break it in. It could take a while for these boots to really feel comfortable., You may also need other types of boots for different types of climbing. You wouldn't want light hiking boots when you're going mountaineering, for instance, as they won't provide enough support.For rough mountain terrains, you'll need mountaineering boots, which come with better traction and stiffer soles (soles that would be too stiff for normal hiking).
Similarly, if you plan to do scrambling, you need to pick a boot built for doing that, that emphasizes good traction. Usually, scrambling boots have rubber soles, which helps increase traction.

, When you're trying on boots, you need to wear the socks you plan to wear on the trail. Different socks will make the boots fit differently.Pick a sock that provides some comfort on its own, as it's supposed to provide some of the cushioning.Choose moisture-wicking fabrics. Don't use cotton socks, as they just stay wet. Rather, choose wool or synthetic fibers that wick away the moisture.
Make sure they hug your feet. You don't want your foot to slide around in the sock.
Pick thick socks for winter and thinner ones for summer.
Choose a sock with a flat seam so it doesn't rub.

, You may be tempted just to stay in your normal size range. However, in hiking boots, you may need to go up a half size or even a full size, particularly if you're wearing thick socks. Try on different sizes to figure out what feels best to you.In fact, have your foot measured if possible. Most reputable stores will have a device available for you to use.Also, your feet will often swell on the trail, so a larger size is generally better.

, Each brand is going to fit a bit differently, and no two people's feet are alike. Therefore, it's important to experiment and figure out which brand is best for you. In fact, the wooden form (called a ""last"") that makes up the inside structure of the boot may be great in one brand and not fit you at all in another brand. Therefore, it's important to make sure the boot feels right as you walk., The boot should fit securely around your heel, as well as the ball of your foot. However, it also shouldn't feel too tight. When you go up on the ball of your foot or move back towards your heels, you should be able to do so easily without it feeling like the boot is stopping you.If it doesn't fit around your heel, you'll end up with blisters.
When the boots aren't laced, check to see if you have about a 1/2 an inch of space at the back (the width of a finger).One way to check is to slip on the boot on your bare foot. If the store doesn't allow that, use the provided nylon ""socks"" that many stores have specifically for trying on shoes. As you test the shoe, see if it rubs or cramps your foot in any place., Any cramped feeling is only going to be exacerbated on the trail. When you try your boot on, make sure you can wiggle your toes and that the boot doesn't narrow too much in the toes for your foot to feel comfortable.In fact, when the boot is laced, your toes shouldn't rubbing against the front of the boot., Just standing in the boots isn't going to give you a feel for the boots in action. Walk back and forth down the aisle a bit to see how they feel. Make sure they are creasing in the right place (just at the base of the toes). Also, make sure your heel isn't slipping out of the back of the boot.You can also do a ""slant"" test. Many shops have a board you can walk down to test inclines. If your toes push into the front of the boot as you go down, you may need a larger size. If your foot sloshes to the front, you may need a different boot entirely.

, Obviously, you need a boot that is sufficiently sturdy for the hiking you'll be doing. However, the heavier the boot, the more tired you will be at the end of the day. Evaluate how much boot you really need, particularly if you are trying to decide between a lighter and heavier boot., Turn the boot over. Try to press into the sole of the boot with your thumb. If it gives way, it's likely too soft. Another way to test the boot is to try to twist the sole. If you are able to twist it, it's probably too soft once again.Soft boots will not protect your feet well enough, particularly for long trails or ones where you go off trail. Stiff soles will give your feet the support they need not to feel every sharp edge and bump on the trail.

, While waterproof boots are not a necessity if you're only doing light hiking, it can be essential if you're on the trail all the time. Wet feet can cause problems, such as blisters, which can lead to you being in pain on the trail or worse, getting an infection.Skip fabric altogether if it's not already waterproof. While waterproof fabric works well, it can be difficult to seal non-waterproof fabric enough for hiking.
Look at boots that are already waterproofed or that can be waterproofed, such as ones made out of leather. If they're not waterproof, you can use waterproofing solution on them, such as a beeswax solution.
If you already have boots that aren't waterproof, consider buying a pair of waterproof socks.

Go shopping at least a month before your hike.If you schedule a specific trip in the near future, work backwards from that date.,
Do some comparative shopping.Use the internet to research products or speak with sales staff to find the right boot for you.,
Handle boots personally before buying.,
Make sure they hug your feet tightly.,
Keep the receipt.,
Wear the right socks.,
Wear your boots around the house.,
Venture outside for brief walks.,
Pay attention to any pain.,
Flex the soles.,
Take longer walks.,
Simulate hikes.,
Continue until you wear them all day.,
Customize your boots if needed.",How to Break in Hiking Boots," Since it can take weeks to properly break in a new pair of boots, allow yourself at least a month between the time of purchase and your first full-day hike in them. From the purchase date, work farther back in time to factor in an adequate amount for you to do some comparative shopping and test-fitting, according to your availability.;
, Consider what type of hiking you plan on doing. For instance, are you looking for an all-purpose pair of boots to wear whenever, or are you planning a specific hike along, say, the Appalachian Trail? Refine your search by factoring in the following:


What distance does your average hike cover?
What sort of terrain do you hike?
What climate and weather conditions will you face?

, Once you have whittled your list down to a few favorites, visit sporting good stores, shoe outlets, department stores, or anywhere else that carries those boots, even if you plan on making your final purchase online.Wear the same socks that you use for hiking to the store. Also bring your insoles if you wear those too, so you can test each boot properly., Take the time to lace them properly. Walk around the store as much as needed to judge how they fit. Since they will loosen up as you break them in, a brand-new pair of boots should grip your feet securely at first, but not so much that they pinch your feet to the point of causing pain, constricting movement, or interfering with blood circulation.An ideal pair of boots should fit snugly at all points, except for the toe of the boot, which should provide a little extra space in front to prevent your own toes from mashing up against the interior when descending hills. All other areas of the boots should grip your foot tightly so that your heel is kept firmly in place within the boot. , If you make your purchase in-store, hold onto the receipt in case you need to return your boots. If you find a cheaper price for the same pair online, familiarize yourself with the retailer’s return policy before completing your purchase. Either way, since even the most “perfect” pair of hiking boots will most likely feel uncomfortable to some degree when brand-new, hold onto whatever paperwork is needed for returns in case the boots show no signs of improving once you start breaking them in., When breaking in your boots, don’t put on a pair of dress socks just because they happen to be handy. Wear socks that are appropriate for hiking so your boots conform to your feet exactly as they will be dressed when you actually go hiking.If you don’t already own some, buy yourself a pair of thick socks made of wool or synthetic fibers, since thicker socks will last longer and these materials won’t retain as much sweat or moisture as cotton.Also wear any insoles or arch supports that you might use for hiking.

, Treat your new hiking boots like indoor slippers for the first few days after purchase. Pad around inside the house while you cook meals, do chores, or simply pace back and forth from room to room. Avoid going outside or doing anything particularly messy or physically intensive. Keep your boots as a pristine as possible in case you need to return them if they continue to cause any severe discomfort after the first few days., If padding around the house doesn’t cause any excessive pinching, rubbing, or other pain, expand your horizons. Take your boots outside for short excursions. Wear them down the block to the corner shop when you need to pick something up or take a stroll around the block each night. Wherever you go, be sure to keep it short at first so that you continue to break your boots in gradually., Your boots need time to break in, so keep your walks short at first so you can better identify sources of pain. Venturing too far too soon may cause blisters that won’t necessarily appear later on once your boots are properly broken in. For now, note where your boots seem to pinch or rub your feet the most. Pay attention to these areas over the coming days to keep tabs on how much or how little the situation improves., Once a crease begins to form along the top of each boot, roughly where your toes connect with the balls of your foot, take the boots off after your walks. Bend the boots toes up and down for a little while each day. Make the soles more flexible to decrease stiffness and allow your feet a wider range of movement. Be gentle as you do so, however, so you don’t overstretch the soles and tear them!Performing squats while wearing your boots will also help loosen the soles.

, As short jaunts to the store or elsewhere become more comfortable in your boots, increase the length of your excursions bit by bit. Take 20 or 30 minute walks through the neighborhood each night. If your feet are feeling fine by the end of the week, use the weekend to take a longer hike through a nearby park. The following week, add another 10 or 15 minutes to your nightly walk. Be careful to increase the duration of each walk incrementally, so that you don’t end up hobbled in the middle of nowhere., Since trails typically aren’t as level or as smooth as sidewalks, take your boots off-road. Find short hills to put them through the motions of climbing. As your boots lose their stiffness, walk over rougher ground to test how they handle uneven surfaces. If you usually wear backpacks while hiking, wear them now with the typical amount of weight that you carry on hikes., Gradually increase the amount of use your boots receive each day until you are comfortably wearing them all day long.At this point, consider them broken in! Set them aside for hiking only so you don’t wear them out from casual use.

, If you continue to experience the same pain in the same area with no sign of improvement, bring your boots to a store that specializes in hiking equipment. Seek assistance from their boot-fitters. Describe the pain and ask what methods and/or modifications could be done to alleviate it.Learn the leading factors that caused the pain to begin with so you know what to look out for when buying future pairs.

Enlist a friend to hike with you: someone who likes hiking and is good company is a good choice.,
Choose where to hike.,
Pack plenty of water.,
Wear supportive, closed footwear and comfortable socks.,
Wear comfortable clothes in layers that you can remove or add as needed.,
Wear a hat and sunscreen.,
Somewhere along the trail you will probably get hungry, so you should pack something like GORP (Good Old Raisins and Peanuts).,
If you are going somewhere with steep, rocky slopes, then fingerless gloves are a good thing to have on you.,
Let someone know that you are hiking, where, and how long you expect to hike.,
Pack a cell phone. ,
Pack basic first aid supplies, including bandages, moleskin, tweezers, and antiseptic wipes.

,
Pack your camera.

,
Make sure you are conditioned for long hikes.",How to Be Prepared for a Hike,";
, Consider the following when choosing: natural views and landscape, accessibility, the availability of marked hiking trails, the length of the hike based on your personal experience and ability. Consider the terrain of the area as well. Hills and mountains are beautiful but even a short steep hike can be too challenging.

, Even if you plan to hike for just a couple of hours, you do not want to run the risk of becoming dehydrated. Plan 1 L per person per hour of hiking.

, Hiking boots are best. If you do not have boots, wear comfortable shoes with thick supportive soles. Make sure to take an extra pair of socks as well, particularly if you are going on a longer hike.

, If you are hiking in an area where the weather is changeable, pack rain gear.

, Pack additional sunscreen.

, GORP doesn't have to be raisins and peanuts. Cherries, almonds, M&Ms, walnuts, cranberries, and peanut butter chips are all good. Anything non-perishable and bite-sized will do. If you are eating a meal on the trail, pack light, and as spill-free as possible. Sandwiches, bite-sized vegetables, beef sticks, fruit leather, and apples are also good trail food. Pack a small bag to contain any trash that you make. Do not leave any trash on the trail.

, Normal work-gloves are good too. Hiking or walking sticks are also helpful for getting up a steep slopes, particularly if you carry a heavy pack or do not have good balance.

, Tell them you will check in with them when you return. Then check in with that person when you return. Just in case anything goes wrong (for example, you get lost), that person will know where to look for you, or know to contact help if you do not return as expected.

,,,, For example, if you are going on a 9-mile hike, try a 5-mile hike a week or two before, carrying the same gear on your back that you will have for the 9-mile. This gives you time to get comfortable with your bag, and to fix any weight-distribution problems in your packing, and also time to find a comfortable strap adjustment.

, Another option is the TrenItalia pass, an intra-Italy train pass - be sure the check the travel restrictions to see which rail pass is best for your trip.

, It is easy to get lost, but once you accept this, your visit will be a lot more fun. Embrace the winding paths and mysterious turns! Be sure to purchase some Murano glass, made on an island nearby. Take the water taxi for a cheap tour of the city, while actually cruising the canals! By the way, if you don't stop and get gelato, don't even bother telling anyone you went to Italy.

, See the grand Cathedral (which recently underwent a massive renovation).

, Do not miss Da Vinci's Last Supper painting, housed in a nearby church. Tickets can be hard to get, so it is best to purchase a bus tour of the city in your language, then make sure the tour includes a visit to the church! That is the easiest access, though treasure your time with the art, as it is a constantly rotating crowd, portioned and monitored by security guards. You get one look, and no photos... the gist shop is great and has all the image reproductions you could want.

, Look for the cute boutiques, which have something for all wallet girths.

, It may take time to get to by train, but it is worth it. These five seaside villages are the realization of the quaint picturesque scenes Americans envision. Most importantly, the best things about these cities are cheap or free. One can spend evenings watching the sun set on the rocks with a bottle of wine and a group of new international friends. And for only a few Euros, you can try the incredible pesto, which was created in this region. The fresh seafood is amazing as well, though beware most places charge by the weight of the fish. By far, the most famous attraction in Cinque Terre is the trek across the four mountains that separate the cities. The climb gets harder as you go North and the third mountain is a two-hour trial. But, the magnificent views, sights of the towns, and sense of accomplishment make the walk well worth it.

, The Florence flea market is a great place to pick up your mementos and Euro fashion at the best prices in Italy. Unfortunately, the museums are costly and there are many of them (even many churches charge entry fees.)

, One of the city's best kept secrets is the Piazza Michelangelo. A simple hike or bus ticket takes you to the hilltop Piazza, just outside of the city, which gives way to beautiful views of the city. This trip is especially worthy at sunset. A hip hangout seems to be in front of the Duomo, so head there at nightfall to see all sorts of locals and internationals alike. There is a great pizza shop, which sells by the slice across the street from the Duomo, great for the budget traveler! Siena, another city very close to Florence is also a gorgeous city.

, The great thing about Rome is that most of the monuments are free. Some of these include the Pantheon, Roman Forum, Circus Maximus, Victor Emmanuel Monument, Spanish Steps, and Trevi Fountain. The two big ticket items frequented by tourist are the Coliseum and the Vatican museums. The Colosseum is overpriced and underwhelming, and is usually accompanied by a long line. The Vatican museum does contain some famous masterpieces, including the Sistine Chapel. But, for those who are averse to spending money, you can still see most of the Vatican including St. Peter's Basilica for free. At night, the Piazza's are a flurry with activity. Camp di Fiori is fully of bars, many with Americans, and pub-crawls. The Piazza Navona is filled with street performers and artists, as well as outdoor cafes. The most beautiful sights in Rome are those of the monuments at night.

What’s important here is to make sure that the caliber of weapon (or type of arrow) you’ve chosen will be enough to properly kill a pig. Your choice of weapon will also have a big impact on the distance from which you can fire.While a rare choice as a primary weapon, many hunters will bring a handgun as a sidearm. Most useful for finishing a wounded pig, you’ll want at least a .44 Magnum to do the job, with .454 and .50 caliber being the only other plausible options.
Shotguns are a popular choice for hunters, though it shortens the distance from which you’ll be able to shoot the pig. If looking for a small pig (under 90 lbs), than any gauge larger than 20 (including 20) will work. For larger pigs, a 12 gauge will be the only suitable option.
Rifles are far and away the most popular choice for wild pig hunters, mainly for their ability to make a kill from a distance. The majority of calibers are also suitable for wild pigs (save for .22 and the 25-20 Winchester). Many hunters will include a scope for improved aim.
If you’re bow hunting, it’s recommended that you use the heaviest pulling weight possible to hunt pigs. A bow will also limit the kill range to about 30 yards or less. Use of a razor-sharp broadhead arrow is highly recommended.;
, While this will completely depend on where you live and where you’re hunting, most places around the world will want you to have a hunting license before you begin. However, there are often caveats in place for pigs in certain places, on account of their large numbers. Usually there are also allowances for private landowners to allow hunters on their property.Be diligent in finding out just what laws and regulations affect your area. There are few outcomes for a hunt as bad as getting caught doing it illegally.
Again, keep your license with you on the hunt. You never know when you’ll run into law enforcement, so keeping it handy is rarely a bad choice.

, While not always a necessity on a wild pig hunt, a good knife is a dependable and adaptive tool. When pig hunting it’s primary use will be to finish a wounded pig. In those instances, the quality of knife can make a tremendous difference. A well-made knife is also a great tool to have in general, and will last as long as you maintain it.For wild pig hunting, you’ll need a knife with a good (no-slip) grip with a blade longer than 6.5 inches. It should be a fixed blade (not a flip knife) and should be kept well-sharpened.
A thick blade with strong metal is important; be sure the blade is at least a quarter-inch thick.

, As with any outdoor activity, you’ll want to wear clothes which are breathable and durable. Avoid cotton as much as possible, as it picks up and retains moisture like no other fabric. Look for fabrics designed to wick away moisture as well as ones designed to wash well (they’re going to get dirty).


There’s not too many must-haves in terms of hunting clothes, but a bright hunter’s vest is one of them, especially when hunting in groups.
In terms of shoes there’s really no better option than heavy duty boots. Be sure any pair of shoes you use is thoroughly waterproofed before wearing them on a pig hunt.
You’ll also want a sizable backpack (or at least one member of your hunting party will) to carry all the essentials besides your weapon.

, Advisable no matter what you’re doing outdoors, a first aid kid is a must-have for hunting wild pigs. While the ideal hunt won’t include any injury, wild pigs are notoriously dangerous and are unique in their choice for charging and fighting over running away. With caution and clean shots this shouldn’t be a problem, but first aid kits are designed for the worst case scenario.


Commercial first aid kits can be found at a variety of stores. Consider browsing your local hunting or sporting goods store for one.
You can make your own first aid kit, just be sure to include a few key items:

Square-sized gauze pads as well as 1.5-2 inch roll of gauze for treating wounds.
Hydrogen peroxide for use as disinfectant.
Safety pins for fastening bandages.
Tweezers for removing splinters.



, Once the hunt is complete and a kill is made, you’ll need to take care of the body, whether or not you plan to save it as meat. Pigs are rarely small enough that you’ll be able to handle the carcass on your own with just your hands. Equipping to haul the carcass from the hunting grounds is critical for any expedition.


Fortunately the technology for moving the body is simple: a rope. Preferably of strong nylon, you’ll tie the hog up and drag it from the grounds. A towel (that you don’t care much for) may be desired to place under the carcass for transport.
You’ll also want a fairly heavy duty pair of rubber gloves (note: latex gloves will not do) for handling the body, especially when it comes time to skin and gut the carcass.

, One of the unfortunate features of any hunting is having to conform your hunt to the habits of the animal. Wild pigs spend most of the daylight hours resting in their “beds:” troughs they form in the ground to cool off in, usually within patches of dense foliage. They are most active in the late evening and early morning. So if you can manage it, a night hunt will be the most successful


Be sure to equip for the occasion; lights or night vision goggles will be an absolute must. Never hunt at night without the appropriate lighting.
Check your local hunting laws and regulations before launching a hunt at night. Some locations only allow pig hunting during daylight hours.

, Pigs are like many other game animals and can pick up scents as a form of warning from quite a distance. You’ll need to de-scent yourself and your clothes before your hunt to make sure the wild pigs don’t catch wind of you before you even see them.


Baking soda is a cheap fragrance remover. Take a shower with it by mixing it into some liquid, fragrance-free soap (don’t use straight baking soda--it will irritate the skin). Wash your clothing with it by including baking soda where you normally would any other powdered detergent.
Diesel fuel is another effective fragrance-remover, if a bit caustic for human noses. It’s best use is if you’re hunting from a blind, to remove any fragrances from the blind itself.
There is also a variety of scents commercially available that will not only mask your scent but also attract wild pigs. It’s still recommended to de-scent yourself, however.

, As with hunting any animal, it starts with using the animal’s own signs to track them. Fortunately wild pigs, more so than many other game animals, leave a variety of signs as to where they have been and where they might be going. Regardless of how you choose to hunt, it won’t be any use unless you’ve got a general idea of where the pigs will be.The first (and likely the first to come to mind) to look for are pig tracks, hoof prints, in the ground. They are near-circles with a slight indent at the front.

You can distinguish them from deer tracks by the deer tracks’ pointed end.
Tracks going straight up a steep incline are a sure sign of wild pigs; other animals usually climb hills at an angle.


Another sign of wild pigs will be their droppings. They come in clumps, with the size depending on the age of the animal. Using a rubber glove, you can examine them for some idea of where the pigs are feeding.
Wild pigs often dig into the ground, looking for roots and other plant life to eat. Look out for sizable troughs in the ground, usually many in a small area.
Wild pigs will also make indents in the ground near ponds or other still water. If you’re near either, look out for what look like artificial holes with splattered water and mud around.
If you see trees with bark removed in spots, or find hair on a tree, it’s probably a sign of wild pigs; they scratch their itches by rubbing themselves on trees.

, If you’re already an avid hunter of deer or other game, you may have a hunting blind or stand which you like to use. Using a blind to hunt pigs is a viable choice, but not necessarily the best one on account of the pigs’ highly mobile nature. Hunting from a blind is good choice, however, if you know the area well.Be sure to have a good spot. Either near an obvious food or water source, you need to set up your stand where the pigs will at some point want to return to.
You’ll want to be downwind of where the pigs will eventually be, in order to avoid them catching your scent.
One of the biggest benefits to hunting from a blind is it reduces the chance you’ll have to face a wounded boar.
You can use a store-bought pig call to lure pigs that you know are close. The best calls will be those which replicate a piglet’s squeal, especially useful when a female is traveling with her young.
You can also hunt from a blind by setting up where you think the pigs may be running from other hunters.

, Perhaps the most traditional way to hunt pigs is to follow their tracks and signs, and take position once you’ve found them. This is certainly (in theory at least) one of the quicker methods to hunt pigs, as you’ll always be on the move unless you have pigs in sight. Provided you’re up for a hike as well as a hunt, tracking to hunt may be your best option.Because hoofprints are so vital to this method of hunting, it’s best to try and plan tracking hunts after a rainfall. The mud makes for a great environment in which to hunt wild pigs.
If you know an area with heavy pig activity, plan a path which makes a circle around this area and move forward with every rotation.
Tracking pigs is perhaps the most viable option if you’re hunting only with a friend or two. Too large of a group would spook pigs you’re trying to stalk. All of the other methods will require some tracking, but this is the only one which requires some surprise.
Once you know you’re near a group of pigs, do your best to become as quiet as possible. It’s best to shoot from a static position for the best (and most humane) shot.

, Given enough people with the right transportation (some sort of all-terrain vehicle usually), you can put numbers to your advantage when hunting wild pigs. Essentially you’ll be spreading out to cover a wider area, as well as provide a greater chance of flushing out any hogs hanging around.Like hunting from a blind, you’ll want to have a good understanding of the land you’ll be hunting on. This will help you decide just how to organize your group with the landscape.
Most likely you and your fellow hunters will spread out in a line, each person relatively far from the next (twenty or so meters). Unfortunately this method won’t always result in a kill for yourself, but definitely increases the chances of multiple kills significantly.
Alternatively, you can have one group of hunters find a spot to sit, stationary. If you know the area of high activity, locate one group on the far side away from the others, and have them push forward in a line to flush the pigs out towards the stationary hunters.
More than any other method of pig hunting, you’ll need to be incredibly aware of the direction of your shot, and absolutely sure there’s nothing but foliage behind the pig you hope to shoot. Shooting a fellow hunter is an unfortunate but not totally unlikely consequence of group hunting.

, Though not necessarily the choice for beginners (as you’ll need a trained dog), hunting with dogs is more likely to yield results. Trained dogs will find the scent of the pigs and track them until they get one cornered; the dogs will bark so that they too can be found, and the pig dispatched.


More than the other methods of hunting, hunting with dogs will require a bit of fitness, on account of needing to follow the dogs a bit of a brisk pace.
Again, any dog used for this should be well-trained. Specifically, they should know to only chase the pigs and to avoid engaging them no matter what. Wild pigs, especially cornered, can be very dangerous.
If hunting with dogs is something you’re very interested in, it is possible to find dogs that come already trained, provided you find the right breeder.
Consider buying some body armor for any dog you use to hunt pigs. They usually come in a few pieces (one for the neck, torso, etc.); this armor can really make a difference if a dog happens to be attacked directly.

, Regardless of how you’ve chosen to hunt, this is one step that will be the same throughout. If you’re hunting pigs, this should not be your first time using whichever weapon you’ve chosen; a pig hunt is not the place to learn a new weapon. You’re going to want to choose a weapon that you’re confident you can make a clean, humane shot with when required.No matter what weapon you’re using, the best shot will be one to the heart and lungs, behind the pig’s front shoulders. Aim for the shoulder itself, high on the pig’s leg. This shot is the best because the cardiac/pulmonary damage will be such that you won’t need to trail for long.
Another plausible shot for those with high caliber weapons (bows and handguns not included) is the neck. You’ll be aiming for halfway between the bottom of the ear and the top of the shoulder. When done correctly, this shot will sever the spinal cord and the animal will drop quickly.
Never make a shot you’re unsure of. A lightly wounded wild pig can quickly become a dangerous enemy; pigs are known for their preference to fight over flight. It is also inhumane to leave a non-fatal wound in a pig. Shoot only when you’re cool and comfortable, and know where the bullet will land.

, Once you’ve shot the wild pig, there’s a good chance that it won’t go down immediately. Many pigs wounded in the chest will run for a good bit before tiring and laying down to die. You have an obligation as a hunter to find and dispatch any pig you’ve shot, no matter what.


If the pig has run off, mark the spot where it was when you first shot it. This will come in handy as a reference point.
Focus on any blood the animal has left behind; usually the wound you’ve made will leave a trail of blood in the direction of the wounded pig. Look out for signs on trees and bushes as well.
Be sure to not just focus on the ground, but look up and around as the pig may be a ways ahead of you, but still visible.

, As mentioned, a single bullet (even in the right place) may not be enough to kill a pig quickly and humanely. Once you’ve located the wounded pig, you’ll need to finish it off out of mercy and respect. Take extreme care in doing so, as even a downed and wounded pig may pose a threat to you.The best choice is a second shot, either to the head or again to the chest cavity, into the heart and lungs. Many prefer to do this with a handgun for ease of use.
If the pig is relatively close to death and safe to approach, you may use a knife to cut the throat or stab the heart (angled thrust, under a front leg) to finish a wild pig.

, If you’re hunting wild pig, chances are you aim to keep the meat of the animal just downed. To do this you’ll need to attend to the body quickly (gutted, skinned, and cooled)--pig carcasses can spoil quickly, especially in hot weather. To transport the carcass, tie your rope around the back hooves and drag it with you.


For safety, you’ll want to use rubber gloves when handling the pig carcass.
Once you’ve got the carcass where you’d like to skin it, hang it with the head pointing up to begin the process. Using your knife, cut skin-deep all the way around the neck.
From the cut made around the neck, use your knife to cut the skin in strips off of the pig’s body. Once skinned, hang in a shady place to dry and cool (down from living, body temperature).

, As with any meat, you’ll want to take every precaution when storing and keeping game meat. Once the meat has cooled to room temperature and dried out some, it should be butchered and left to freeze, covered in butcher’s paper.


When handling the meat or cutting through it, be especially careful to avoid nicking either the bladder or the intestines. Cutting into either will spill the contents, ruining the meat.
Come time to eat the meat, be sure to cook it completely (to 170 degrees Fahrenheit) so that any lingering parasites or bacteria are totally killed off.
Any meat you don’t eat needs to be disposed of quickly and correctly. Don’t dump it and allow other wildlife or your pets to get to it.

Get some wood.,
Check to make sure your wood is about one to one and a half inches wide and five eights of an inch thick.,
Begin shaping the wood.,
Understand that you must leave the bark on the back of the bow (the side that faces away from the archer) If removed, it may crack and break.,
Making the bowstring.,
Make the string three inches longer than intended to be so you can make a loop for stringing and un-stringing.

,
Start taking a fourth string that is two inches longer and twist it around it.

,
Begin making loops for stringing and un-stringing.,
Take a long string of the same material and wrap it tightly around the string only where you are going to nock your arrow.

,
Let your bow dry before stringing so that it does not warp and lose its springiness.,
Understand there is a faster way to make it dry.,
Make arrows out of cheap dowel rods.,
Know that the longer the bow the more power it can have and the easier it is to make, Depending on your height, you may want to make it as tall as you are.",How to Make a Flat Bow and Arrow," Any number of woods can be used to make a good flat bow; however, hickory, oak, ash, teak or yew work very well. composite bows are the best, but they must be sinew backed and that is not covered in this article.;
, When you're done it should be about one centimeter thick and three eights of an inch wide at the end and the same as what you started with at the base where the limb and the handle meets. There can't be too many branches on the limb -- branches mean weak points. Shave all the bark off of it except for the back of the bow which is the the outer part of the curve. Put your hand where it will normally be and mark it with a pen. Once this is done, put a second mark over the top limb's mark. The arrow will go in between these marks.

, Do not cut into the handle part. Use a thin hide, such as rabbit or squirrel hide. Wrap it tightly and use either fletching glue or hide glue. This will stay the same way it is so that it can support the limbs. To make this process go faster you can hack rather than whittle the wood. The best to use is a coarse sandpaper. Make the thickest part of the limbs at the base and make it narrowest at the end. Both limbs must be the same thickness or the bow will not bend right, making it worthless.

, Make the notches for the string on the sides of the bow, cutting them diagonally facing down on the belly. Make the string two inches from the notch.

, Braided sinew works good. Nylon string works ok. paracord works well. You must take three strings and twist them together. And if that still isn't enough then repeat this procedure two more times and finally twist all three of them together. Make the individual lines about 5–10 inches (12.7–25.4 cm) longer than the bow is. Keep in mind you will also need extra string for loops and string gets shorter when it is braided together

,,, The final part of making the string is to make a primer so that the string does not wear out.

,, Once it has dried, put some bow finish on it. Without bow finish, it will crack and break from rotting.If you put the bow finish on before it dries out, it will lock the moisture in. This will cause the bow to warp. So it's wise to be patient and let it dry.

, First, don't try putting it in a hot attic. You'll leave it there and forget it or overestimate the time it needs to be in there. The heat box is a better method. Find a long enough box for your bow. Then cut a hole on the wide side on both sides. Take a 125 watt light bulb and fix it to dangle in the box without touching the box. Do not use a cardboard box! It will catch fire. Use a nonflammable box. The way a heat box works is it pries the moisture out of the bow and the moving current through the holes carries the water away.

, Before purchasing, roll them on the floor and if they roll they are straight. If they are not straight, they won't fly straight. Don't sharpen the ends of the arrows.they will become dull within a short amount of time.instead use glue on triple point broad heads. There is a cheap military issued broad head called M-A3-L. Some archery shops will sell these.

, For about a 45-60 pound bow, it should be four to six feet tall.

Continue respecting the rules for hunting waterfowl after you get your kill.",How to Legally Hunt Waterfowl," Many states require hunters to take a course designed to assure they have weapon handling skills needed to safely participate in hunting. Some have a grandfather clause that permits older, and experienced hunters to hunt without this training.;
, You will need the following:


Federal Waterfowl Stamp
State hunting license
State Waterfowl stamp or endorsement if required
Management area permit if required

, Do not trespass to hunt under any conditions, as this may be a felony violation since you will be in possession of a firearm.

, Steel or alloy shot are preferred over lead shot since they are less damaging to the environment. In some cases, specific shotgun shot sizes less than number 4 are not allowed either.

, Different waterfowl have different values, so a mixed bag of birds may cause you to exceed the limit by points, rather than the actual number of birds. Some species (example, Mallards) may have a one bird limit, either sex, where another, (example, Coots) may have a multiple male bird limit, but still a one bird female limit.

, Normally, birds with more brightly colored feathers are males, drabber colored birds are females.

, The stipulations for hunting on farmland are pretty specific.


You can hunt over a field that has not yet been harvested.
You can hunt over a field that has been harvested if it has been flooded.
Hunting over an area where seed has been purposely scattered (baiting) is prohibited.
Avoid areas that have been baited.
Planting under normal agriculture schedules and processes is not considered baiting.
Do not hunt over a field that has been partly harvested.

, Though wildlife food plots are a normally occurring practice for other wildlife, the practice does not fall into natural agricultural planting and would be considered baiting for waterfowl.

, It is unlawful to hunt waterfowl over areas where farmers store feed for their animals or locations where they put grain out to feed.

, It is acceptable to abide by the 10-day-rule which allows hunters to hunt waterfowl on an area of land that would be considered baited after waiting a period of 10 days after the last of the ""bait"" is gone.

, Only a shotgun that hold 3 bullets can be used. Any gun higher than a 10 gauge or any other type of weapon cannot be utilized in your hunting efforts. This includes but is not limited to traps, rifles, pistols, high power guns, poisons and explosives.

, Boats must be shut off or the sail put down. Land vehicles should also have their motors disengaged. Any vehicle from which you are hunting must be immobile. Vehicles are not to be used to rally or stir up birds.

, Live birds should not be used as decoys. Recorded calls or electronic amplifications of bird sounds are not to be used.

, Take only the daily limit. Do your best not to leave any deceased or maimed birds on the field. Tag your birds immediately with thorough and correct information. Do not leave them in anyone else's possession until you do so. Birds cannot be fully field dressed on the field. The head or 1 fully-feathered wing must still be intact while in transport.

Wear orange, lots of it.",How to Keep a Horse Safe During Hunting Season," There are different type of hunt: non-jumping, optional jumping and jumping. Don't go to a jumping hunt until you are sure of your horse an its ability out hunting. If you would rather not jump, go non-jumping, and if you want to jumping, try optional. This means if you don't like the fence you can go around it.;
,


If you are unsure whether your horse has been hunting before, then it is best to put a green ribbon in their tail. This shows that they are ""green"". People are more likely to pass you safely.
If you think your horse might kick, put a red ribbon in its tail. This will warn others to stay of the horse's bum. Also, remember to stay away from red and green ribbons if possible.

, Horses get strong out hunting. A bolting horse horse could cause a lot of damage.

, Don't do anything you are not capable of. Don't attempt a jump if you are not sure your horse will get over it.

, These are very dangerous. Do not jump them (they can get thorns stuck in your horse's legs).

, If it is wet/slippery don't attempt to jump. Jumping on slippery ground may cause a fall of horse and/or rider.


Don't attempt to hunt after dark, without Hi-Vis.

, Even if the hunt ends, you might want to walk round the roads until your horse is no longer blowing.

, Sometimes it is safer to do this once you get home. You may also want to trot up if your horse feels stiff.

,, If at all possible, keep horses in during early morning and at dusk or during foggy weather.

, Or if the temperature allows, put a brightly colored blanket on the horses.

, Orange hunting socks can be placed on fence posts, gates, placed on a tail (like a tail bag), electric fence and any other creative areas where it will be easily seen.


Prominently post “No Hunting” signs on gates and fences.

, A small bell (not for every horse) can be fastened to a horses halter.

, Trail rides are better with company as well.


No matter what the season, when headed out on trail with your horse, tell someone your planned route and what time you will be back.

, Hunting season is not the time to be silent. Keep up a constant banter or sing. Even better put bells on your mount. Bear bells, cow bells, sleigh bells, etc. all work extremely well at alerting hunters of your presence. They may help keep bears and other predators away too!

, A phone in your saddle bags does you no good if you are separated from your horse.

,, Stay in open fields where you will be more visible. A horse traveling through the trees might be mistaken for an elk but is more obvious in the open.


Stick to the main trails and fields and avoid the thick wooded areas where it is harder to identify you.

, Wearing hunter orange may not be a fashion statement, but it can save your life. It’s also the law in many states across country.

Obtain your hunting license.,
Practice with your weapon.,
Gather your hunting gear.,
Decide on some decoys.,
Purchase blinds.,
Refine your turkey calling skills by listening and imitating turkey clucking, yelping and purring.",How to Hunt Turkeys1," Contact your local Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) or Department of Natural Resources (DNR) for licensing requirements and rules. Licenses may be purchased from State-approved license agents (such as some sporting goods stores), or, depending on your State, through an online application.








Pay close attention to your State’s hunting license requirements. You will likely need to provide a hunter education course completion certificate.
Your hunting license will contain information regarding the length of the season, season dates, the hunting area, how many males and females you may hunt per day, and how many males and females you may hunt per season.;
, Because turkeys startle so easily, hunting them requires precision shooting. Practice shooting from different positions (standing, sitting, lying down) and from different distances. If you are using a shotgun, you will need to pattern it. Patterning your shotgun allows you to make informed choices about which gun, ammo, and choke (the constricted end of a shotgun muzzle that shapes the spread of the shot) combination to use. To pattern a shotgun, follow these instructions:

Position a 48” square piece of blank paper approximately 40 yards (36.6 m) from the muzzle of the gun. Shoot at the center of the paper.
Draw a 30” circle around the center of the shot pattern enclosing the greatest number of holes. Count the pellets in the circle.
Open an identical, unfired shotgun shell and count the number of pellets.
Calculate the percentage of pellets in the 30” circle by dividing the number of holes by the number of pellets in the shell.
Repeat this process 10 times and calculate the average of all 10 results.
If your pattern is small and clustered together, you have a good gun/ammo/choke combination. If the pattern is spread out across the paper, consider changing one element at a time: begin experimenting with different pellet (shot) sizes, then different shell sizes. If that does not work, consider purchasing a tighter choke, which will focus the shot in a much smaller radius. , In addition to your camouflage clothing, you will need a few reliable supplies to be well prepped. Following are basics—you may include additional extras as you see fit:









Your weapon of choice. If you decide you want to carry a firearm, opt for a 12-gauge shotgun or smaller. A smaller shotgun means less bulk, making shots from a crouched position less cumbersome.
In terms of ammo, autumn turkeys (younger, smaller turkeys) require a smaller load than spring turkeys (mature turkeys). Choose a smaller sized shot (1¾ ounces of size 6 shot) for youths (poults) or hens who have smaller, weaker bones.Turkey calls are invaluable as they draw the turkeys closer to the hunter and make for clearer kill shots. Having three or so different calls—high-pitched gobble yelps, low-pitched gobble yelps, and high and low hen yelps—allows you to use calls appropriate for the situation.

, Decoys are another means of drawing turkeys closer to the hunter. This allows the hunter to be freed up to lie in wait.








, Blinds are helpful concealment tools while hunting famously skittish prey. Pop-up blinds are lightweight, easy to transport, and quickly create a place for a hunter to hide.








, Sometimes it takes different combinations to lure out toms. In the fall, make hen sounds to hens and tom sounds to males. Do the opposite in springtime. Following are four effective types of calls:









The Kee Kee Run is the high-pitched whistle made by a poult. It sounds like “hurry-hurry-hurry” or “boy-boy-boy.”
A lost yelp is made by a hen and sounds like a series of 10-15 sorrowful yelps.
A gobbler yelp is a low, hoarse yelp delivered slowly. At times, these yelps are followed by purrs indicating aggression.
A gobble is a low, guttural sound made by a male turkey. A long series of these may sound like a challenge to nearby turkeys. Be sure you are alone when using this call as it may attract other hunters.

"
"
Scout out your hunting territory.,
Track and lure your turkeys.,
Load your gun with the safety on and keep the muzzle pointed down.,
Once you’ve gotten the turkey in your sights, aim for the bird’s neck.",How to Hunt Turkeys2," Locating turkeys in the fall is more difficult than in the spring because gobblers aren’t as vocal in autumn months. Still, there are typical locations to spot large flocks:









Open areas, such as fields with long grass, house cow pies (a source of corn for turkeys!) and grasshoppers. Fields of corn, wheat, and berries provide rich sources of food and are frequented by turkeys.
Wooded areas provide turkeys with places to roost. Look for feathers, v-shaped scratches in tree trunks, and droppings at the base of trees. Male (tom) turkey droppings are approximately 2” long and are shaped like the letter “J”. Female (hen) droppings are round and circular in shape.If you wish to hunt on private land, you should contact the landowner and request permission well ahead of your planned hunt. Following up with a small gift is a common courtesy.

, After you’ve scouted out the terrain and have a good sense of the lay of the land, follow the flocks closely. Stage decoys close to roosts and employ various calls.









Set up blinds in close range (40 yards or so) of your decoys.
Put your back against a tree. This helps to obscure you from the turkey’s vision and allows you to position firearms without being seen.

, Only aim the gun when you're sure you have a clear shot of the turkey. You may need to employ alternate tactics to isolate turkeys to gain those clear shots:









Pick off loners. You can gain a prime shot of a lone turkey by attracting it over with soft, alluring purrs.
Scatter and recall. If you are unable to tease a stray turkey out of a flock, try creeping in close to a group of poults and hens and begin waving your arms wildly and making loud sounds to scatter the birds. Once they scatter (and hopefully not just fly away altogether), begin to lure them back with soft kee kee runs or lost yelps.Block the route to their food. If you’ve successfully tracked the flock and know where they feed in the morning, set up between their roost and their food. Place a hen decoy near your blind and make a series of yelps to attract the toms.

, Shooting the neck and head area raises the odds that you will kill the bird immediately. If you fail to kill the bird and only wound it, track the bird quickly and kill it humanely.








"
"
Gear up with the right bow.,
Get as close to the turkey as possible.,
Hide yourself as best you can.,
Aim wisely.",How to Hunt Turkeys3," Short axle-to-axle bows (33 inches or less) are good for hunting turkeys because they are made for easy maneuverability while seated or crouched low to the ground.









Axle-to-axle length is a measure of the distance between a bow’s cam/wheel center. The axle-to-axle length does not affect the accuracy of the shot as much as brace height—the perpendicular distance from the strong to the pivot point of the bow’s handle.
Make decisions on your axle-to-axle length based on your hunting needs. For example, if you are hunting from a blind, you would select a shorter axle-to-axle bow to make shooting easier.
Adjust the poundage of your bow. Poundage is the amount of force (measured in pounds) required to draw the bow to a set difference in order to shoot. The poundage to shoot big game (like deer) is typically around 70 pounds (meaning you must pull 70 pounds in order to shoot and kill).
When shooting turkeys, set your poundage to 60 so you are able to hold your bow at full draw for as long as possible. This allows you to shoot quickly and without being detected.Use expandable broadheads. Broadheads are flat pointed steel arrowheads with sharp edges. Expandable broadheads open on impact and cut bigger holes. This is important as turkeys have small vital areas., Place decoys 15 yards (13.7 m) out from your set up and shoot 20–25 yards (18.3–22.9 m) out. Decoys both draw the bird closer and serve as markers to indicate how far away the bird is as he approaches them.








, Whether behind a big tree or in a pop-up blind, hide well as turkeys can easily spot the smallest motions. If you are concerned about the motion of drawing your bow, consider using a crossbow as they are always cocked.








, In order to ensure a kill, aim for the turkey’s head (popular with those using expandable broadheads because they take the head clean off the bird), the butt of the wing, the rear end (where a severed spine paralyzes the bird), or between the legs, halfway up the body of the bird (severing the leg tendons making it difficult for the bird to walk or fly away). Humanely dispatch of the turkey in the event you do not kill it right away.

Clean your kills.",How to Hunt Squirrels," Squirrels are categorized as small game in most states (interestingly they are classed as vermin in the UK) and are therefore subject to the statutes pertaining to small game hunting. Obtaining a small game license in any given state usually entails filling out a form with your address, a driver’s license number, and other information, as well as paying a small fee.


Though small game licenses aren’t usually as regulated, many states only grant a specific number of certain license types each year, so you may want to pay attention to the date your state begins accepting license applications for the year.
For any questions you have regarding licensing, seasons, limits, etc. contact the proper governing body in your state. Each state’s hunting regulatory department goes by a different designation as well. For instance, in Nevada, it is the Nevada Department of Wildlife,whereas New York’s equivalent is the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.;
, Many states additionally regulate the specific breeds of squirrel you can hunt in any given season. In South Carolina, for instance, you can hunt gray squirrels, but many areas do not permit the hunting of fox squirrels.These specific regulations vary by state and region based on existing populations.
Many states may also differentiate between squirrel breeds that require a license at all. For example, the California Fish and Game Code classifies ground squirrels as non-game mammals, which can be hunted without a license if they are a nuisance to crops or property; however, all tree squirrels in the state are classified as small game and require the proper license.If you want to hunt squirrels on your own property because they are damaging your home or property, then check with your state’s regulatory department for specifics. This may require having a professional out to identify the breed as well.

, Each state will additionally observe widely varying seasons when it comes to squirrel hunting. For example, squirrel hunting season starts in Virginia in September,but in Missouri, it starts much earlier at the end of May.


Also pay special attention to “no firearm” seasons, during which you can hunt squirrels with dogs, but being caught with a firearm on your person is illegal., In addition to when you hunt, states also regulate how much you can hunt. Bag limits are usually posted as daily limits, and these also vary by state. As examples, New York state and Virginia set a daily bag limit of six squirrels,whereas Missouri sets a higher daily limit at ten.

, There are several different choices suitable for squirrel hunting; however, you state may regulate the type of weapon you can use, and they may also require you to specify your weapon type on your license application. Make sure that you only use weapons you are comfortable with, licensed to use, and for which you know how to handle safely. Options for squirrel hunting include:


Bow and Arrow - Archery is the hunting technique that involves the most skill. Learning to shoot a bow is not an easy task, and mastering it takes a very large amount of dedication and practice. Archery may be tough, but it is also one of the best ways to hunt squirrel. It is virtually silent, even quieter than air guns, so you can often hunt an entire family of squirrels without them realizing it. And the arrows are usually reusable unless you break them, and are very modular as far as the tips go. There are several different types of arrows you can use. Straight limb is a low-power type of bow usually found homemade or in youth archery departments. Recurve is a higher-power type of bow that is very accurate but is harder to draw and hold back. Compound bows are very high powered, easy to hold back, and their accuracy can be punishing, but they are very expensive, require a lot of maintenance, and are very sensitive to shock damage (they don’t take kindly to being manhandled).
Air Rifle - Air rifles are inexpensive and effective if fired with good accuracy. They are also very quiet, making it the weapon of choice for suburban squirrel haters. A simple .177 daisy pellet rifle can be bought from Walmart or some gun stores for around $50.00, and higher quality ones can set you back a lot more. Either way you go, you should experiment to find the the type of pellet your gun shoots most accurately since precise pellet placement is more important than minor differences in pellet penetration or expansion.Pellet rifles require top-notch shooting on the part of the hunter because a wounded squirrel can usually still climb a tree. Pellet rifles usually work better for this.
.22 caliber firearm - The .22 caliber is probably the most commonly used cartridge for squirrel hunting. The small size prevents overkill that destroys a lot of meat. The long range and high accuracy gives it the ability to hit squirrels from much further away than air rifles, shotguns, and archery. Many .22 caliber weapons are also auto loading, giving you the ability to get that quick follow-up shot if needed.However, like any firearm (or any projectile flinging apparatus for that mater) it is only as good as the shooter behind the sights. The point of impact is only .22 in. Accuracy counts in a very big way, but that is part of the challenge that draws people to this sport.
Shotgun - If what you desire is a larger spread, look no farther than the shotgun, although you will have to be closer to your quarry than the .22 can get you. If you choose to hunt with a shotgun, the recommended shot size if 5 or 6 on a shotgun with a 28” or 30” barrel length. Shotgun shells tend to be more expensive than other ammo, and they take up a lot of space in your gear. The large recoil may limit some smaller-built hunters in endurance as well. Shotguns are also louder and meaner sounding than .22s and air rifles, meaning that you are more likely to spook squirrels in the area.

, Whatever weapon you choose, you should ensure that you get plenty of practice with it in a safe, controlled environment before trying to hunt with it. Familiarize yourself with the safety setting on each weapon, and ensure that it’s always on except when you are ready to shoot.


Additionally, keep your weapon shouldered or pointed at the ground with your finger outside the trigger guard except for when you are ready to shoot.
Never point a weapon at anything unless you intend to shoot it.
Remember that an arrow can be just as dangerous as a bullet, so take all safety precautions with a bow as well.

, Squirrels are most active during daylight hours, and both morning and late afternoon can prove very productive times to hunt squirrels.Many squirrel hunting seasons start around late summer or early fall, so time of the year plays a part as well. You can use the rustling of not yet fallen leaves to help you locate squirrels in trees, though the same leaves that give away their position help to camouflage them as well.

, Squirrels especially love acorns, beechnuts, and hickory nuts. By looking for oak, beech, and hickory trees, you’re much more likely to find yourself in areas of higher activity., Cutting refers to the grinding noise you’ll hear that is evidence of a squirrel cutting the husk off the nuts it eats, and it is followed by the paired noise of the same husks typically falling through the leaves of the tree and hitting the ground.By looking and listening for the evidence of squirrel cutting, you can pick a great spot to set up shop and wait.

, The two main camps for squirrel hunting are those who play the waiting game and those who decide to stalk the squirrels.If you choose the right spot to set up, then waiting can be productive; however, many experts have more luck taking a stalking approach since you can follow the telltale signs of squirrel cutting.


Regardless of your approach, patience is the name of the game. If you choose to stalk, you must still move very slowly and quietly. Only take two or three steps at a time, and then pause to listen for movement., Camouflage clothing is very useful. If you can afford or make a ghillie suit, even better. But a blind of some sort is invaluable, even if it is just a log you are hiding behind. Squirrels that live in the forest are extremely shy, and if you can get within 15 yards (13.7 m) of one, you are doing extremely well. So, to get close to the squirrels, you will have to set up in an area that you can easily camouflage. You will want to be able to move to a shooting position with as little disturbance to the area around you as possible. If you have a hunting buddy, you should have them stand a few yards out to see if they can spot you lying in wait, as well as moving to a shooting position.

, If squirrels hear unfamiliar noises, they tend to pause for long periods in their trees to wait for the potential danger to pass.By mimicking the noise of other squirrels eating, you can convince the frozen squirrels nearby that they’re okay to resume their business.


One easy way to mimic the sound of squirrel cutting is to take two quarters—one flat and the ribbed edge of the other against it—and rub them together with a bit of pressure.This very similarly replicates the grinding noise of squirrel cutting.
A second way to mimic squirrel noise is to drop your hand into the litter beneath an oak tree and rustle the leaves there at random intervals.Repeat this without making any other noise at all.

, A variety of different traps and trapping methods are available for squirrels as well; however, states also highly regulate squirrel trapping, so contact your state’s regulatory department to find out what trapping methods—if any—are permissible in your state.

, Shooting into a tree for a squirrel always means shooting upward, so you want to make sure you take safe shots. You want to aim in such a way as to ensure that the bullet hits the tree if you miss.You will also have an easier time making safe, precision shots if you always keep the sun to your back as you stalk., In order to kill the squirrel in one shot, as well as to preserve as much of the meat as possible, you want to aim for the head.Squirrels are, well, squirrelly, and hitting one someplace other than the head may give it time to get further up the tree or into a hole before you can aim for your second shot.

, Take your time waiting for the squirrels and setting up the shot, especially if you are a new hunter. Moving too quickly may make more noise and shooting too quickly may cause you to miss your shot. Missed shots, as well as any noise you make, can scare the squirrel away. After a shot, you may have to wait as long as half an hour before a squirrel comes out of hiding.

, After successfully hunting a squirrel, you’ll need to skin and gut it in order to preserve the meat. You can learn all about the process for cleaning a squirrel at: How to Clean a Squirrel.

Pheasants have very good hearing and eyesight.;
, Depending on where you live, you will be subject to various regulations and licensing requirements.


You may need to tag and record your hunts.
You may be required to wear orange.
Some locations require hunting education.
Be aware of your locality’s rules regarding age, as well as load and firearms., While hunting pheasant without a dog is possible, it will be much easier with a dog to track and locate birds for you.


Labradors are good at tracking and flushing pheasant out of heavy cover. They are popular options.
Pointers are good for finding birds in light cover and notifying owners., There are a variety of options, and you will want to keep in mind not only your target, but long hours of walking and carrying the gun.


Stick with a gun that weighs less than 8 pounds.
A 12-gauge shotgun is always popular for hunting pheasants, although 16- or 20-gauge are possibilities.
Double-action shotguns are most common, although some hunters prefer semi-automatics.
Lead shot is often banned on public lands, so you’ll need steel. Pheasant hunting requires a heavy shot, like size 4.

, It's likely to be wet and cold, and you'll be doing a lot of walking on uneven terrain., It’s usually in the late fall through the early winter, but the specific dates can change based on where you live.


The best pheasant hunting in the U.S. is in the Midwest and Plains states like Iowa or South Dakota, although pheasants can be found in other parts of the country., You can't just hunt anywhere.Public grounds often provide good hunting during cold weather or later in the season, but you will be competing with many other hunters, as well as their car doors and noisy friends possibly scaring off the birds.
Public grounds can be more challenging, and more dangerous since there will be less control over who is there and what they are doing.
Arrive early, and try to find less popular spots.

, Dogs can smell better in cold, wet environments. It’s also easier to track pheasants in mud and snow., The birds are out looking for food in lighter cover at those times and are more easily located.

,


If the weather has been dry, the birds will gather near water.

, They offer several benefits, including guides.


They often begin earlier than hunting season on public lands, so you can practice with your dog. This is particularly useful for young dogs who need more training.
You will have the opportunity to get comfortable with your gun, and you can practice shooting clay pigeons, which requires shooting ahead of your target.
Clubs offer a variety of cover to experience.
Clubs release the birds throughout the day and you can request varying degrees of difficulty., Your dog will be especially helpful you are alone, so be sure to hunt into the wind.Drive around a strip of cover and position downwind.
Move toward an open area or an obstruction to slow the birds.Rises and ravines are also good positions because you have cover, and birds are obstructed.,


Groups can cover much more ground.
The social aspect of group hunting is an attraction for many hunters.

, Be meticulous. If you are in a group, coordinate your patterns.


Pause frequently to confuse the birds and make them nervous.
Be very quiet at all times. Use hand signals to other hunters rather than shouting to each other. From the time you arrive on the grounds, to the moment you leave, be very quiet.
Be patient.

, When your dog stops and points or quivers, get close to him quickly and quietly.


If you a using a flushing dog, such as a Lab, the dog will flush out the rooster.
A pointing dog, such as German Short-haired Pointers, will point to the bird, allowing you to do the flushing.

,


Pheasants have three toes pointing forward, with the middle often being longer.Tracks are more easily visible in mud or snow.
Pheasants like corn, so look for corn patches. They are attracted to the green and shade.
Pheasants also like thick cattails and marshy areas.

, Make your shot only after the bird is above human height. You will have about a two second opportunity, so you need to be very quick.


If you hit the bird and killed it, good job! Most dogs will retrieve the bird for you, or you can get it yourself.
Dress and cool the meat as soon as possible to avoid spoilage.
If you did not hit the bird, just try again next time!

, A dirty gun could misfire or malfunction.,


Always be aware of where your muzzle is pointing.
Disengage the safety as you approach the point.

, Your reaction time will improve with practice. Don't risk unintentionally firing.


Know what you are pointing at, but also what is behind it., You may not be required by your state, but wearing bright colors could save your life.

, If everyone walks shoulder-to-shoulder, there is much less of a chance of accidentally firing on each other., Birdshot can spray out, and could hit a dog or person.


Do not aim at water.

, Drugs or alcohol will impair your judgment and reaction time.

, Hunting is a cherished hobby for many families. But aware of your state's age restrictions before setting out.


Consider weather conditions when taking a child hunting.

Learn the regulations.,
Find a place to hunt.,
Choose a Firearm.,
Scout the land.,
Hunt from a stand.,
Stalk the hogs.,
Hunt with dogs.,
Call the hogs.,
Shoot a hog.,
Dress the hog.",How to Hunt Hogs," Because feral hogs are a non-native species that competes for food with wildlife and livestock and destroys the habitat of native species,most states with a wild hog population have very relaxed regulations for hunting them. Even so, it's important to know the law in your state.


In Texas, for example, hogs can be hunted every day of the year and any time of the day. Under some specific circumstances, you don't even need a license.By contrast, in Oklahoma, hogs can only be hunted in the daytime, and on public lands may only be hunted during certain times of the year.;
, Many property owners will allow you to hunt hogs on their land, either for free as a means of eliminating unwanted hogs, or for a fee.Check the internet and newspaper classifieds to find a place near you to hunt hogs.
Currently, feral hogs are most plentiful in the south, but can be found in 35 states. Because they are so prolific, many believe it's only a matter of time until they are in all of the lower 48., When selecting a firearm to hunt hogs, the most important thing to consider is accuracy. Hogs are tough animals, so if you don't hit a vital organ, they are likely to flee.Also important is the caliber of the weapon. Because hogs are tough, guns that fire larger rounds are usually a superior choice.
The minimum caliber for a hog hunting rifle is the .270 Winchester. A better choice is a .30 caliber rifle such as the .308 or the .300 Winchester Magnum.Other good options include the Browning Automatic Rifle, which comes in a special Hog Stalker model just for hog hunters.Other firearms manufactures also offer specialty hog hunting weapons such as the Savage Hog Hunter and the Weatherby Hog Reaper.You may also wish to consider a silencer, as this will make it harder for hogs to locate you after you've fired, and will also dampen the muzzle flash if you are hunting at night., Once you've found a place to hunt hogs, it's a good idea to scout out the land in advance to find the best places on the property to stalk hogs or set up a stand.


Look for hog droppings or signs that hogs have been rooting (digging) in the area. Land that hogs have rooted on generally looks as though it has been plowed.Hogs like to wallow in mud and shallow ponds, making such areas ideal places to hunt.
Placing motion-activated game cameras around the property is another good way to figure out where hogs gather., Especially if the weather is bad, you might want to hunt hogs from a stand or blind. This is basically a small shed, often raised above the ground, in which you can hide while waiting for hogs.While in the stand, you'll need to stay as quiet as possible so that hogs don't know you are hiding there.
Be prepared to log some hours waiting for hogs to come by. Especially if your stand is not well positioned, you may have to wait all day for a hog.
Using game cameras, you can keep of track of any hogs that might be headed your way, so you can be ready for them if they come.
Placing bait near your stand may increase the possibility that hogs will come by., Many hunters find still-hunting and stalking a more exciting way to hunt hogs, because it keeps you more active and you cover more territory.Still-hunting is moving slowly along through likely cover, looking for an animal to shoot. Stalking is creeping up quietly on an animal you've already located.This approach allows you to cover multiple high-potential locations in a day instead of just one location where you have built a stand.
When actively looking for hogs, you will most likely hear them before you see them. Move slowly and stop every few feet to listen for the sound of hogs.Hogs are somewhat nearsighted and tend to get preoccupied when feeding. Hogs that are eating, then, will be easier to sneak up on., In many states, it is legal to use dogs to track and flush out hogs.Some hunters like this method best because the excitement of dogs can be energizing.To hunt hogs with dogs, you'll need at least two dogs. First, you'll need a ""bay dog"" (or several) who's job it is to find a hog and alert you to its presence by barking. You'll also need a ""catch dog,"" who can meet up with the bay dogs once the hog is cornered, and grab it by the face or ear until you arrive to kill the hog.Bay dogs can be any kind of trained dog with a good sense of smell, catch dogs need to be large, powerful dogs, such as a pit bull or American bull dog.Make sure all your dogs are wearing cut vests to protect their necks and vital organs from the hog.
This type of hunting can be dangerous for dogs. it is a good idea to learn dog first aid and carry some supplies for patching your dogs up, should they be injured.

, You can also buy hog calls, either electronic or mouth-blown, which can in some cases attract nearby hogs.Electronic calls that are programmed with the sounds of piglets in distress are often most effective.

, Once you've found a hog, take aim and shoot it. As mentioned before, hogs are tough, so make sure to shoot at their vital organs, otherwise they may flee.


Shoot for the neck. A bullet anywhere between the shoulder and jaw or ear will usually stop a hog in its tracks.Another good area to shoot is right behind the shoulder. Here you can hit the heart or a lung without damaging choice cuts of meat.Try not to hit a hog's shoulder. Aside from the bone, hog shoulders are covered with an extra-tough hide of scar tissue developed from fighting.Hitting a hog in the shoulder may do little more than scare it away.

, Once you've killed a hog, you'll need to remove several of the organs to get at the meat you want.


Always wear latex gloves when dressing a hog. Hogs can carry swine brucellosis, a disease that can be transmitted to humans.Start by rolling the hog over on its back and spreading its hind legs. Then, cut down the center of the belly from the breast bone to the base of the tail, cutting through the hide and belly muscles but not puncturing the stomach or intestines.Then, roll the hog on its side and pull out the stomach and intestines.
Finally, cut around the diaphragm, then sever the esophagus and windpipe and pull out the heart and lungs, and drain any excess blood.
If the stomach or intestines were shot or punctured, wash out the body cavity with water as soon as possible.Get the meat in a cooler as soon as possible to prevent spoilage.

Usually, this can be done by applying online with the Department of Wildlife, or the Department of Fish and Game. In some areas, you might need to pass a hunting safety or a gun safety course or a quiz before being awarded a license to hunt rabbits.


Update your license before every new hunting season to make sure that you're up-to-date and legal. In many areas, kids under the age of 14 are allowed to hunt without licensed. Find out the local guidelines in your area, if you're underage, and only hunt with adult supervision.;
, Depending on where you live, harvesting rabbits may be limited to a particular season. Usually, rabbit season lasts from late fall and continues throughout the winter, though in some regions, like California, rabbits may be hunted year round.


It's also good to figure out whether or not you're permitted to harvest rabbits in designated areas. Often, rabbit hunting is illegal in state or national parks, while in other areas certain areas are permissible for hunting. If you've got a spot in mind, make sure it's legal to hunt there at the time of year you're considering hunting.

, Usually, you’re not allowed to take more than six rabbits at a time. In some places, though, there’s no limit on small game, including pheasant, rabbit, and other animals. Check the guidelines in your area to be sure.

, There's more than one kind of rabbit and not all should be hunted. Mexican Volcano Rabbits, for example, are extremely endangered and should never be harvested, though they look much like regular cottontail rabbits. It's important that you learn to identify the appropriate varieties of rabbit you'll be hunting, to keep your hunt legal and safe.Generally, these varieties of rabbits have extremely healthy populations, in the ""least concern"" category of wildlife preservation:


White or cottontail rabbits are the most commonly hunted rabbits, and there are several varieties of regional cottontails that vary slightly in appearance. Desert cottontails, for example, have extremely large ears, while swamp rabbits have smaller, sharp faces that resemble rodents more so than rabbits. Unique to the cottontail, however, is it's brownish-black fur and distinctive cloud-white tail. If you see the tail, you can be confident it's a cottontail.
Jackrabbits are distinctive for their thin ears that stick straight up. Black and white-tailed jackrabbits are common in desert regions and commonly hunted. They have long legs and grow to quite large sizes, making them ideal for hunting in some areas.

, Rabbits are commonly hunted with hunting rifles, shotguns, pistols, and even bow-and-arrow rigs. For many hunters, a .22 hunting rifles is perfectly effective for hunting rabbits, but it can be difficult for inexperienced hunters to make accurate shots with a .22. Rabbits are fast, making a smaller-gauge shotgun sometimes the best tool for the job.


If you use a shotgun, don’t go any heftier than a 20-gauge. Rabbits are small, meaning that a more powerful weapon constitutes overkill.
Use shotshells with 6 or 7.5-size steel shot. If you’re planning on eating your rabbits, make certain that you remove the shot and only use steel, never lead.

, Historically, rabbits were most commonly hunted using baited traps that were used to injure the rabbit and keep it in one place to be harvest later. Nowadays, hunting rabbits with spring traps, or other varieties of snares is illegal in many areas. It's most common to hunt rabbits using firearms, not traps.


Catching rabbits with live traps is perfectly legal on your own property. If you're going to catch a rabbit, use a live trap.

, Rabbits live in all kinds of habitats, and can flourish and nest in a variety of environments. To learn where best to find rabbits in the area you're hunting, talk to some local hunters to get a sense of heavy-traffic areas that would be safe hunting zones. In general, you'll often find rabbits bedded in or around the following areas:


Tall grass
Clover
Broadleaf fields
Soy, wheat, and alfalfa
Gardens

, Wherever you elect to hunt, you need to make sure that you've got permission to hunt and you don't accidentally wander on private property. Wandering around on someone's property toting guns is a good way to get into an awkward altercation, meaning that you should take special care to avoid these entanglements. Have property owners walk you around so you know your borders, or get a detailed map of the area to make sure you don't accidentally wander off property.


Hunting in state parks and nature reserves also requires lots of extra precaution. Trigger-happy hunters should avoid high-traffic areas.

, Wild rabbits are most active early in the morning and just as the sun is setting. Like many animals, rabbits feed in minimal light, as the sun is going up or coming down, meaning that they'll be most active at those times. The soft light can sometimes make it challenging to find rabbits, but you can learn to train your eye in the right direction to find rabbits in their habitats.

, The most common way of hunting rabbits is to walk around slowly and allow the noise of your tromping through the woods to scare them up. Unlike hunting deer, which requires absolute silence, you want rabbits to be able to hear you. You need to be quiet enough to listen for movement, but don't worry about absolute silence.


A good walking style is to take 10 even paces, then pause and wait 30 seconds. Look to the ground at likely candidates for rabbit nests, and watch closely for signs of movement.
More often than not, the waiting period of silence after walking and making noise is what will scare up a rabbit. Be patient.
If you’re hunting with others, stagger your paces so you’re not all walking at once. Wait until you see your buddy pause before you start moving. You can help scare up rabbits toward the other, flushing them out.

, In snow, mud, or other wet conditions, looking for rabbit tracks can be a great way of finding a general area that needs more exploration. If you see a variety of fresh rabbit tracks, double-back on the area, or consider following the tracks to see if you can't find the rabbit's nest, called a ""form.""


Forms are often built into shallow areas or bowls, then lined with grass, leaves, and the rabbits' own fur.They can be tough to recognize, so it's usually more effective to keep an eye out for the rabbits themselves.

, Increasingly, large fields and other hunting regions that were once flush with rabbits are difficult hunting grounds. Some hunters nowadays prefer to jump around between a few different areas, moving more quickly to cover large ground, rather than assuming that you'll scare up a few rabbits in the location that you've chosen. Try to be patient, but also recognize areas that might be too high traffic with hikers or other humans to be a good habitat for rabbits.

, Cottontails and other rabbits are extremely well camouflaged. Old-timers and experienced hunters know to look for the glinting eye of the rabbit, as opposed to trying to see the whole rabbit. Seeing the rabbit before it sees you can help you get set and train your gun before the rabbit takes off.Sometimes, the dark eye can stand out against the background, especially if it's snowy. Keep an eye out for the dark glisten of the rabbit's eye.

, Four-legged hunting buddies are excellent for scaring up rabbits and helping to flush them back toward you. Beagles, in particular, make excellent rabbit hunting dogs, letting loose with loud, piercing yowls when they scare up a clutch of rabbits. If you're a dog person, consider making use of a hunting dog.


Dogs can also be used to track injured rabbits and retrieve them. Using dogs in rabbit hunting makes the whole process less tiring and a whole lot easier. A properly trained hunting dog can drastically increase your haul.

, Anytime you're out hunting, you need to be extremely careful and always make the safety of you and everyone in your hunting party the number one priority. Every time you hunt rabbits, make sure that you bring the following things:


Blaze orange clothing. Even if you want to incorporate some camouflage into your hunting gear, you need to stand out from the other hunters in your party, and other parties who might be out looking for rabbits. Blaze orange hats, vests, and other gear is commonly available at sporting goods stores and it's essential for any hunting trip.
Ear plugs and safety glasses should be worn every time you're shooting. Invest in a good pair of each and use them each time you're using a firearm.
Heavy clothing, long shirt sleeves and pants are good for keeping your protected from the elements, and from sharp brambles or other obstacles you might encounter while out in the field.
Bring plenty of water, some emergency supplies, and first-aid, especially if you're going to be traveling way out in the field, or will be hunting over the course of multiple days.

, If you’re hunting in a group, you need to be especially careful about keeping track of all the other members of your hunting party. Hunting accidents are common, but the proper safety measures and presence of mind will keep tragedies from becoming a part of your next hunt. Anytime you're hunting with a group, keep in mind the following guidelines:


Everyone should be at least 50 feet (15.2 m) apart, far enough to make shots safe and accurate in the space allowed, but close enough to be able to see one another.
Communicate effectively. Keep talking, or signaling to one another effectively while you're out. If you're going to take a shot, you need to call it, shouting ""Mine"" or using some other designated signal.
Never shoot parallel to the ground. Rabbits are on the ground, which means your gun barrel needs to be pointed downward at all times. Under no circumstances should you be firing a weapon up in the air or parallel with the ground, unless you want to injure someone. Don't do it.

, Unfortunately, rabbits are commonly afflicted with bacterial infections and diseases, meaning that you need to be aware of any outbreaks in the area in which you're hunting, and learn to recognize the signs of tainted meat, especially if you plan on eating the rabbits you harvest.Rabbits infected with Tularemia, a common disease affecting small game populations, will act strangely. Rabbits will appear lazy and behave strangely, walking slowly and having delayed reactions. This is more common in extremely hot weather., Depending on your situation, the environment, and the number of rabbits you've collected, you may want to dress out the rabbit right away, or wait until you've gotten home, or back to camp. In cold weather (around 50 degrees F), rabbits will be fine for several hours. Since most rabbit seasons are during this time of year, it's most common to wait to dress rabbits until later.


To field dress a rabbit, you'll need a sharp hunting knife and your hands. Start by making small cuts around the ""ankle"" bones of the rabbit to remove the feet, then making a small slit across the back of the rabbit. Grab the fur firmly and pull it in opposite directions, slipping the fur off like a jacket. It should come off quite easily.
When the fur is bunched around the rabbit's neck, you can use your knife to remove the head, or twist it off firmly and discard. Use your knife to make a small incision between the groin and the ribcage of the rabbit, being careful not to puncture the cavity.
Hold the rabbit with the feet pointing down and use your finger to hook the entrails out and down. They should fall out easily.
Wash the cavity of the rabbit and dry it thoroughly. Once the meat is cooled to room temperature, it should be refrigerated below 50 F as soon as possible. The meat should keep for up to a week.

, Depending on where you've been hunting, you might need to safe some of the fur, or leave part of the rabbits intact for examination before you're allowed to take it home. Make sure you familiarize yourself with the regulations in your area to keep in full compliance.

",How to Hunt Moose," Most moose hunts are in remote northern regions of North America and take place in the fall, so you will need cold weather clothing, a stainless steel rifle is highly recommended, a good backpack, an all-weather tent with a rain fly and camping gear.;
, Google maps is a handy tool for seeing what the topography looks like where you will be hunting. Also, many states and provinces should have detailed orienteering maps for more detailed remote travel. A GPS is almost a no-brainer for detailed orienteering for the modern hunter.

, Due to the remote locations of most moose hunts, hunting by yourself in bush Alaska or Canada is not a smart move. You probably won't have cell phone coverage, so if something happens and you need a quick exit out having a buddy along is much safer. And much less boring!

, Location, Location, Location again is everything with moose hunting. Where are you going to hunt? Can you get there by boat, on foot, or with a canoe (yes, it is possible to hunt moose out of a canoe, but REALLY hard and not for the physically unfit.)? Hunting with a 4x4 is another well-used hunting method in Alaska and Canada. If you have money, hunting with planes is the easiest and offers the ability to get to the most remote locations.

, Alaska, Maine, and Canada all have extensive hunting regulations to manage their wildlife in a sustainable manner. If you break the law you will get caught and if you don't now hopefully you will in the future. Wasting meat and unsafe hunting practices have no place in the sport and give honest hunters a bad name and ruin future hunting chances in North America for everyone. Get a regulations book and read it!

, This goes without saying, but every year dozens of hunters get stuck in remote North American locations hunting moose and need a helicopter ride out of the bush. Some don't get out and are never found due to sloppy preparation, alcohol abuse, and lousy outdoor gear. Quality clothing is key. Gor-tex boots, rain gear, thermal underwear, and wool socks could save your life if you get stuck away from camp overnight. Avoid cotton clothing. It doesn't wick and won't dry out. Try to stay as dry as possible. Chances are it will rain a lot. It's late fall in Alaska what did you expect, Cancun?

, It varies by states to which sex you can shoot. You can't shoot cows in Alaska hardly ever (they do have some special lottery hunts) and never a calf. Bulls are also highly regulated. In Alaska, for example, many units will only allow you to shoot bulls over 50 inches (127.0 cm) or with 3-4 brow tines. The Alaska Regulations book will show you detailed pictures of what you are allowed to shoot and they don't allow excuses from errant hunters. In Ontario you will be issued a tag for just one sex, cow or bull, and that's all you can shoot.

, 1,000 of lbs of meat is wasted every year by sloppy field butchering methods. Bring game bags in your pack and get the quarters into the bag asap. Keep flies away as much as possible. Don't put the meat in water. It will rot faster. Keep your meat dry by hanging it high (One word: Bears) on a line. There are meat treatment sprays you can buy at your local outdoor store to treat the meat. If you don't know how to gut a moose then buy a book or watch a video on You Tube. Have the moose packaged by a reputable butcher, if you can afford it. If not buy tons of freezer bags, butcher paper, good knives, and a meat grinder and do it yourself.

Learn about “muleys.” In addition to their wide-ranging habitat and big ears, mule deer have other distinctive characteristics that are important for a good hunter to recognize.,
Identify your hunting ground.,
Follow the rules.,
Equip yourself properly and safely.,
Don’t underestimate the hunt.,
Scout out a promising hunting area.,
Set up in the right location.,
Locate and wait.,
“Spot and stalk.” If you prefer the “thrill of the chase” to camping out in a set location, mule deer make excellent prey for stalking.,
Make sure you are within your effective shooting range.,
Take your best shot.,
Track down a wounded mule deer.,
Finish the job.",How to Hunt Mule Deer," The more you know before the hunt, the more likely you are to find success.You can identify mule deer not only by their ears, but also their typical coloring (grayish-brown, with a light gray face and a black forehead “mask”) and size (up to 3.5 feet tall and 7 feet long, and roughly 130 to 280 pounds in weight). They can see fairly clearly for up to 600 yards (and, as nocturnal feeders, have excellent night vision) and can smell a human approaching from up to half a mile away (with a sense of smell roughly one thousand times better than ours).
“Muleys” eat weeds, leaves, twigs, and shrubs like other deer, but tend to be more picky eaters, preferring tender vegetation. This makes their foraging areas more limited (and therefore easier to identify).;
, As indicated above, you can find mule deer in the contiguous United States from Texas to Washington state, and especially throughout the Great Plains region. Mule deer hunts can happen on snowy mountains and in arid deserts, so it pays to do some research on when and where you want to engage in your search for that trophy “muley.”Before choosing when and where to hunt, determine if you are willing and able to deal with extreme temperatures and or weather conditions. Mule deer hunts usually involve several days spent mostly out in the elements, so extreme heat or cold can certainly be a concern.

, For your own safety (and to avoid legal troubles), as well as for the benefit of a mule deer population that is in decline,hunt only in season and according to the regulations established by that state, province, or territory.


In the U.S., contact the relevant state wildlife agency for information on hunting seasons, licenses, regulations, etc. Website links for seventeen state wildlife agencies in “muley” territory can be found at https://muledeer.org/state-wildlife-agencies/.
Familiarize yourself with any restrictions on the size or type of deer that can be taken during that state’s particular season. If you are hunting mule deer bucks, the definition of “antlered” may be as simple as “having an antler fully erupted through the skin and capable of being shed.”Meanwhile, the big prize for serious hunters is a “muley” that is over 200 inches (500 cm) in length and has a antler spread of at least 30 inches (76 cm).Your target buck is likely to be somewhere between these two extremes.

, Hunting mule deer or another species of wild game can for many people be an enjoyable and rewarding experience. However, never forget that you are in control of a deadly weapon, be it a bow or firearm. Proper training and firearm safety practices are essential, starting of course with young and/or new hunters but also including even seasoned veterans.In addition to firearm safety practices, investing in proper equipment will make the odds of an enjoyable and successful mule deer hunt much better. You will be scouting out “muleys” from long distances in low light conditions, so high-quality binoculars and a spotting scope are a worthwhile investment. Choose hunting clothing and gear that is suited to climate conditions (hot, cold, or in between), but also give preference to softer fabrics that are less likely to “crinkle,” rustle, or make other noises that might give away your location. Remember, mule deer have excellent hearing., While you’ll sometimes hear of a hunter who hops out of his truck and bags an impressive buck, mule deer hunting is often a taxing physical and mental challenge. Prepare your mind and body beforehand, and remember that the substantial effort you put into the hunt can make the reward all the sweeter.


Especially if you plan on stalking your prey (as opposed to scouting out a location and waiting for a good target to come into range), make sure that you are in good physical condition. You’ll need to be able to track over long distances in potentially rough terrain, crouch or lie down for long stretches, and be ready to react at a moment’s notice.Patience is a definite virtue when hunting “muleys,” whether you are stalking them or waiting in your chosen location. There’s a lot of waiting, a lot of stillness, and a lot of silence; take advantage of this change from the hectic nature of your normal life., The first step in hunting mule deer is figuring out where to find some of them, of course. Depending on geography, mule deer tend to forage freely at night and then bed down for the day in high grass, brush, or thicket. Learn to identify “muley” tracks and follow them where they lead you. Examine the plant life for signs of foraging as well.Mule deer need to have access to water every day, so a creek, stream, pond, spring, or other water source can make a good starting point for your search. Look for tracks to and from the water source., Whether you’re playing the “waiting game” or utilizing a stalking approach to your hunt, determining the best location in which to set up for your shot is essential. Consider factors like visibility, vantage point, and wind direction when setting up.Setting up on higher ground than your intended target is almost always a smart hunting strategy, and it typically holds true when hunting mule deer.
However, remaining downwind (or at least crosswind) from your target is even more essential when hunting “muleys.” As mentioned, mule deer have a fantastic sense of smell, and are likely to sniff you out if you’re upwind, even if you use a masking agent.

, If you don’t plan on stalking your mule deer prey, but rather want to wait for them to come to you, you need to pick the right location and practice a great deal of patience. Once you’ve established your target area, do a grid search to determine the best place to set up (on an elevated position near a watering hole, for instance) and get into spotting position.The first two hours of daylight in the morning and the last two hours in the evening are the best times to spot mule deer. They are heading to their bedding spot after foraging all day during the former, and getting up and out to feed again during the latter., You can spot them in the early morning, then spend the day (while they rest) moving slowly but surely into your ideal position, for instance. Or, you can scout out the bedding location beforehand, then set up before dawn to ambush your target “muley” as it returns for the day.Remember, patience and persistence are key to hunting mule deer. Think of it more as a chess match, with moves and counter moves, positioning and repositioning, and long pauses between the action.

, Whether you are stalking your prey or waiting for it to come to you, and no matter if you are using a bow or firearm, you need to practice patience and ensure that the mule deer is within your effective range for a clear shot. As a responsible hunter who shows respect for the hunt, you owe it to yourself and your prey to make sure your shot counts and brings down the “muley.” You will no doubt feel an adrenaline rush, but do your best to remain calm, composed, and focused on the task at hand.


While it is always helpful to get as close as possible to improve the accuracy of your shot, the heightened sensitivity of mule deer to sounds and smells mean that you may not want to encroach closer than you need to. Basically, stay as far back as you can while retaining full confidence that you can hit the target accurately., The phrase “you only get one shot” is quite often true when hunting mule deer. Miss your mark, and you will probably lose your prize (or, even worse, lose it and cause it a slow, painful death later on). In terms of choosing where to aim, you have several options. Shots into the brain or spinal cord will cause the quickest, most humane death, but are also much more challenging for the typical hunter. Basically, aim for a spot you know you can hit.Brain shots are the target of choice for many professionals, as they cause instant death and preserve all the meat. However, it is very easy to miss completely or, worse, wound the deer in the face or mouth.
A properly-placed neck shot will snap the spinal cord and cause quick death, but again, the target area is very small. A miss may paralyze but not kill the deer, or cause a wound that will cause a slow, painful death if the deer escapes.
A shot that passes from one shoulder blade through the other will also sever the spinal cord and kill quickly, but is likely to damage some of the meat. Also, once again, the target area is small.
Heart-and-lung shots, targeted behind the front leg and slightly up from the chest, are the traditional standby for most hunters. Such shots usually cause significant bleeding, which is beneficial because you will almost certainly have to track and finish off the wounded deer.

, Unless you are an expert marksman or happen to make a lucky shot, your “muley” is unlikely to drop dead in place from a single shot. To claim your prize and end your target’s suffering, you need to be ready to track and kill the deer you just hit. Be prepared for what may be a time-consuming process.


Parts Three and Four of How to Go Deer Hunting offer good advice on identifying and following blood trails to the injured deer, as well as finishing the kill. One piece of advice you may be surprised to see is to wait thirty minutes before you begin tracking the deer. An immediate chase may cause the deer to run further afield, while some patience may cause the wounded animal to lay down and bleed out closer to your location.

, Once you track down your wounded target, it may well be lying down or standing with little urgency to move. Some hunters abide by the practice of slitting a prone deer’s throat in order to end its life, but a properly targeted shot from close range works at least as well. Whatever method you choose, bring the impressive creature to its end without added pain and suffering.


Once the deer is confirmed dead, you will need to field dress it. While this is an easier process to learn by watching a seasoned veteran, How to Field Dress a Deer offers good step-by-step directions with illustrations.

Grip the pistol firmly with your trigger hand.,
Bring your other hand to the gun.,
Extend both arms so that your two arms and chest form a triangle.,
Bring the gun up so that the sights or red dot align on the target.,
Slide your trigger finger into the trigger guard and place your index finger on the trigger.,
While keeping the sights aligned on the target, pull your trigger finger straight back into the pistol grip.",How to Shoot Your Daisy 717," Push the back of the pistol grip into the web between your thumb and forefinger, then wrap your middle, ring, and little fingers around the front grip so pistol is positioned snugly in the pocket formed by your palm and the meaty part of your thumb.;
, Wrap the fingers of this hand over the middle, ring, and little fingers of your trigger hand and curl the index finger of your non-trigger hand around the front of the trigger guard. The thumb should overlap the thumb of your trigger hand. Squeeze gently, so that your trigger hand is pulled into the other hand, with the pistol grip sandwiched in between.

, This is a very stable position that is seen often in the movies and on cop shows. Your feet should be about shoulder-width apart with the foot opposite your trigger hand about half a step forward. Flex your knees slightly. Now, you have turned your arms into a very stable shooting platform.

, If you’re shooting with iron sights, align the sights so that the front post is the same height as the rear blade and there is equal space on either side of the front sight as it floats in the notch in the rear sight. The entire “sight picture"" should be over the center of your target.

,


If you air pistol has a heavy trigger, place your finger so that the trigger is caught in the joint between the tip and the next segment of your finger. This will give you enough leverage to pull the trigger.
If your air pistol has a lighter trigger, place the fleshy part of your fingertip on the trigger. You may want to experiment to see which works best for you.

, Try not to pull the pistol to one side as you pull the trigger. Relaxing the middle, ring, and little finger of your shooting hand may help. Use your non-trigger hand to help maintain the position of the sights on the target. The key to this method of shooting is that the two arms brace against each other and the trigger hand braces against the non-trigger hand for good shooting stability.

Fifteen years ago, maybe 10% of participants in firearm classes were women, today that number is up to 30%. According to the National Rifle Association, women of all ages enroll at a higher rate than ever.

, Help preserve your right to life, your inalienable rights, fundamental freedoms and spiritual rights to choose your way of life; first be informed, and vote for or against the well-meaning, ""gun-fear"" talkers and actors, and be prepared to ward off potential threats, possible weakening of your freedom, from within or without.

, The most important aspect of teaching anyone -- and especially children about guns, boy or girl -- is safety first and ""always"".


Never leave a child unsupervised with a firearm.
Seek firearm safety, from experienced trainers and gain expertise (and to get your own concealed carry permit/license).

, How? There is probably one more round already in the firing chamber, if it was either actuated, pumped or fired even once.


Removing the ammunition magazine/or clip, does not unload that gun. A chambered bullet must be removed separately, by hand. Otherwise, it is the most deadly, live round that you can even imagine!
Do not buy a gun or pistol without knowing that if: you take ""Concealed carry permit training"" with a revolver, then you must be retrained to carry a semiautomatic pistol which uses a clip/magazine, and is more involved! The other way around works, because revolvers are super simple!

, Be armed and capable of self defense with arms. Remind detractors that a gun is an inanimate objects that can not point or operate on its own.


Guns are power tools and like most any other tool will cut, puncture or ""bite like a snake"", if not handled carefully.
Children should never play with power tools.
Do not let children ""play"" with real guns, or even air guns without proper training, supervision and attitude adjustments as required!
Never point any gun, even ""unloaded"", at anything that you do not fully intend to fire upon or destroy.
Some firearms do not have a safety, or can fire, if loaded, without releasing the safety first, if it has one that is not set! A ""pump shotgun"" may have a stop that must be released before you can ""pump the handle/slide"" to load the first shell into the chamber. It does not automatically go back on safety after that.

, You may enter concealed carry class afraid of the gun, but as few as 4 or 5 hours later you may be on the shooting line, blazing away, having a safe, good time. Women may have certain physical capabilities, but could you, physically fight-off a man breaking into your house or jumping into your car, who was a determined attacker?



Start with an introduction to firearms class: include the child accompanied by the parent. The best age for a child to start training depends on serious mindset, your trusting each one, and their own reliability; each child is different.

, Learn all about: loading and unloading it, how to set the safety, if so equipped. Be sure of what is between you and the target -- and beyond.


Never put your finger on the trigger until you are ready to aim. Hold the weapon with both hands. Does it kick, jerk or rise? If so, be sure to hold with strength, muscles tensed. Aim. Squeeze the trigger (do not ""pull or jerk"" the trigger or the weapon).
Never fire a weapon where bullets or shot may go through several walls and could travel for a mile before hitting ""something""(?).
Never fire straight up into the air, indiscriminately; realize the bullet will, of course, come to a stop and fall back near you and can do serious damage. Imagine the injury or harm from a metal hailstone(s) of the size of the guns projectile(s).

,, Teach your children and grandchildren. It is important that all children be taught:


Respect the gun;
Handle the gun correctly;
How to not be afraid of it (when handled properly).;
,


Enrolling children in an ""Eddie Eagle GunSafe® Program"" for firearm education at an early age is a quick way to keep you and them safe (The National Rifle Association has local adults trainers in an eagle suit). ""The program is for pre-K through third grade with four important steps to take, if they find a gun."" The steps are presented by the program's mascot, Eddie Eagle, in an easy-to-remember form with the following simple rules:If you see a gun:

Keep shooting.",How to Shoot Skeet," As in trap shooting, skeet shooting involves aiming at small clay targets that are launched through the air to simulate bird hunting. They're typically orange and typically about 4–5 inches (10.2–12.7 cm) in diameter. They're fired individually and simultaneously from two different points at each side of an arc of stations, where you'll rotate, firing between 2 and 4 shots at each target. A round of skeet involves 25 shots.;
, Generally speaking, a skeet gun is an over-under double-barrel shotgun. Though any type of shotgun would be appropriate for the task of shooting skeet, this type of gun is often referred to as a ""skeet gun"" among experienced shooters for its accuracy and range.


Consider adding relatively open chokes to improve your accuracy and ensure that you'll hit the target regularly. This is a common addition among experienced skeet shooters.

, When shooting skeet, you'll move between 7 different stations in an arc (21 yards from the target launch) and one point from slightly closer up. You're essentially aiming in the same general direction each time (down range) but you'll change your angle on the targets when you move from point to point. There are two traps which release clay targets from either side of the range, one low target and one higher target, both of which will cross your field of vision and your firing line. The object is to hit both of the targets.

, The order of the targets being released changes from station to station. Generally, you'll only shoot one target from each trap, though this changes at different points along the way. Learning the pattern is part of the strategy of the event.At stations 1 and 2 a single target is released from the higher trap, then a single target is released from the lower trap (sometimes called ""high house"" and ""low house""). Then, there'll be another target released from the low trap, and then targets released simultaneously. On the simultaneous release, the object is to shoot the higher target first. A total of four shorts will be taken at each station.

At stations 3 through 5 a single target will be released from the higher target, then a single target released from the lower house, for a total of two shots at each station.

At stations 6 and 7 The pattern is exactly the same as stations one and two. A high target, a low target, and then simultaneous targets. The only difference is that the lower target should be shot first this time. There will be a total of four shots taken at each of these stations.

At station 8, the closer-up station, you'll shoot a high target and a low target. If you've not missed up until this point, there'll be a bonus shot on a target released from the lower house.

, If you've never shot clay before, stand inside any one of 7 stations positioned equidistantly around a half-circle on one side of the skeet field, between the high and low houses and take a few practice shots to get used to the flight pattern of the targets. Practice to get a sense of their timing and their basic trajectory.

, Facing the target, keep your back straight and spread your feet to a comfortable width. Bend your forward knee slightly and place your weight on your forward foot. Bring the gun to your shoulder and keep it tight in. Maintain good cheek weld on the stock and get a good sight picture with your gun.

, As you mount the gun, practice tracking your shots with the safety on and the rifle unloaded a few times to get a sense of the motion. The targets move pretty fast so it's no wonder that experienced shooters have to develop a fair amount of muscle memory to shoot well. It's got less to do with perfect ""aim"" and more to do with these mechanics. Once you've gotten your swing loose, it's time to shoot a few targets.

, Getting a sense of the trajectory and the lead you need to give each target will take some time, but once you've got it dialed in, you'll be winging 'em out of the sky. Adjust your lead time if you are missing the targets too often and move from one target to the next. Use your natural swing as much as possible to quickly track each target and squeeze the trigger., Just as in golf and basketball, accurate target shooting like this involves a certain amount of follow through. Imagine that your swing is like an arc that you push a button on to start and pull the trigger to activation at some point along the way. The arc doesn't stop after you fire. Keep moving the gun through your swing after you pull the trigger, but remove your finger from the trigger when you're finished.

, To get regular access to the club’s facilities, join a skeet club. There, you can meet other shooters, learn tips, and even start competing. Some clubs have skeet leagues you can join.

, As an NSSA member, you’ll be able to shoot in registered tournaments, improving your accuracy and your scores, and even acquiring a ranking.


The levels are generally classed at different skill levels, so you can compete against shooters with a similar handicap when you're first getting started. Don't worry about being the best yet. Focus on the mechanics and keep shooting and you'll eventually climb up., An experienced shooter can offer you helpful advice, critiques, and pointers to straighten that learning curve. As you improve, a coach can continue helping as you compete, kind of like a caddy does a golfer. Certified skeet-shooting instructors are an invaluable help when you're first learning.

, Reading about it won't help you get any more accurate. Get out there. Shooting regularly will help build in the necessary muscle memory and get you shooting accurately. After a while, it'll be raining clay.

Pick a rifle that fits you.,
One method of sighting at home is to bore-sight it.,
Tuck the stock into your right shoulder, where it feels comfortable.,
Place your dominant hand on the grip.,
Note the distance from your shoulder to the grip.,
Instead of moving your eye down to the rifle, hold the rifle across your body so that you are standing side-on to the target.,
Sight on your target.,
Use BRA: Breathe, rest, aim method.,
Note where the shot landed.,
Keep practicing.

",How to Shoot an Air Rifle," Length and weight are important. You should be able to comfortably hold it steady at ninety degrees to your body (parallel to the floor) without having to rest it on anything.;
, For this you will need a break barrel air rifle. If you do not have one then skip this step. Break the barrel just a bit so you can see down the barrel. Look down it and aim at a target. WARNING: Do not look down from the end of the barrel as it can risk eye injury. once you have picked and aimed at a safe target through the barrel look through the sights and line them up with the same thing while keeping the barrel aimed at the target.

, This applies even if you are left-handed; most rifles are shaped for right-handed users. If you are left-handed and find this uncomfortable, you can buy left-handed rifles.

, Keep your finger off the trigger for now.

, Your other hand should be about the same distance forward, under the body of the rifle. Don't touch the barrel.

, This allows you to look along the barrel by simply tilting your head slightly, and is much more comfortable.

, Check your rifle's instructions to learn how to use its particular sight. Most often, you have a small, notched piece of metal at the end nearest you, and a vertical stick (sometimes within a ring) on the end of the barrel. With this type of sight, you have to line the rifle up so that your target point is in the centre of the notch, and then bring the barrel up so the stick fills the notch, with the top of the stick level with the top of the notch. On quite a bit of new rifles you will have two red dots on the side nearest you and a green dot on the end of the barrel. Repeat the last steps the same way. Remember: Back sight, front sight, target.

, Take a deep breath, let it out halfway and hold it, rest a second and then slowly squeeze the trigger. To avoid trigger flinch you should squeeze so slowly but steadily that the firing surprises you. If you are not surprised then you knew it was coming because you squeezed too hard and possibly reflexively flinched which throws off accuracy.

, No sight will be perfect, so adjust. If it landed too high, aim a little lower. If it hit over to the right, aim left.

Always treat the shotgun as it were loaded.,
Hold the shotgun correctly.The gun should be held at all times with your non-firing hand on the hand stock, roughly in the middle of the grip.,
Put the gun in firing position.,
Weld your cheek to the stock.,
Develop your swing.,
Decide what you want to shoot.",How to Shoot a Shotgun1," Always wear ear and eye protection when shooting. Keep the safety on until the gun is in firing position. Never put your finger on the trigger until you're ready to fire. When you're not in firing position, keep the barrel aimed up or straight down at the ground, never point the gun in the direction of yourself or anyone you're with, and always assume the gun is loaded.


Before you try aiming, loading, or firing a shotgun, learn to respect the shotgun for what it is: a dangerous and powerful tool.;
, Cradle it firmly, using the ""V"" created by your thumb and forefinger. Hold the grip of the gun with your firing-hand (the hand you write with) on the grip behind the trigger. Hold onto the gun securely but gently, as if you were giving it a light handshake.

, Pull the gun snuggly into the shoulder, keeping your hands in the same position, but rotating the gun up. Pull the butt firmly into your shoulder. Failing to keep the shotgun tight in your shoulder will make the ""kick"" more painful when you shoot the gun. Keeping it tight allows your body to absorb the kick, as opposed to the gun bouncing into your shoulder.


Your feet should be shoulder width apart, your knees flexed slightly, with your body turned roughly 40 degrees to the side of the target your firing hand is on.
Your finger should not be on the trigger, but holding the stock behind the trigger guard with the rest of your fingers.

, To aim properly, you need to develop what is called ""cheek to stock weld,"" which means that you've aligned your eye evenly with the sight of the shotgun by keeping your cheek in tight to the stock. When the butt of the shotgun is pulled into the pocket your shoulder makes with your pectoral muscle, let your head rest against it by relaxing your neck.


If the shotgun has a sight aperture about halfway up the barrel, align the gun so the sighting point near the tip of the shotgun barrel lines up in the aperture. Practice letting your cheek fall to the same point on the gun and aligning the sight-points as quickly and as comfortably as possible.

, With an unloaded shotgun, ensure that the safety is on and practice bringing the gun into the firing position quickly. Push the gun straight out from your body, then tuck the butt of the shotgun firmly into your shoulder, keeping it tight against the pocket your shoulder created with your body.


Like in golf or tennis, shooting a shotgun is partially about swing. Whether you're sport-shooting or hunting, bringing the shotgun to firing position quickly and comfortably is an important start of the process.

, Mostly, shotguns are good for shooting moving targets in the air. If you decide to go to the gun range or to a safe rural property with lots of space where you can practice, you'll probably want to practice shooting clay pigeons before you move on to hunting or other kinds of shooting.


Gun ranges will have clay target areas with automated machines that launch the clay onto the range and various positions on the range from which you can shoot. This is a good way to learn from more experienced shooters. When you're in position, yell ""Pull"" for the clay operator to push the button and release the target onto the field.
Take a turn launching the clay onto the range to watch the technique of others. It's a great way to learn.

"
"
Go to a place where you can safely shoot the shotgun.,
Load the shotgun.,
When you're ready, pull the trigger smoothly.,
Develop your accuracy.",How to Shoot a Shotgun2," Remember that shot goes for several hundred yards, and slugs even farther. Gun clubs and shooting ranges are the safest bet to start out with and learn the basics. Shoot some clay to get familiar with your shotgun before taking it into the woods.


If you're going to hunt, make sure that you're not on private property, that it's the appropriate season, and that you follow the laws and regulations in your area.

, First, make sure the safety is on. If you have a ""break action"" shotgun, meaning that the barrel and the butt hinges open to allow for a shell to be inserted, flip the break-level, which will usually be on the top of the gun near the back hand grip. The gun will hinge open, so you can insert a shell into the barrel. Firmly snapping the gun back closed loads the shotgun. Leave the safety on until you're ready to shoot.


For semi-automatic shotguns and pump-action shotguns, you'll take a shell, orient it so that the brass end is facing the rear of the shotgun, cup it in your hand, and lift it up into the loading port directly ahead of the trigger guard. You should be able to load 3-5 shells into these types of shotguns.""Pumping"" the shotgun will load it. Alternatively, you can pull the pump back, opening the sliding shell-ejection port and insert one shell at a time. Moving the pump back forward will load the shotgun.
Only load your shotgun when you're in position to shoot. Make sure the safety is on until you're ready to shoot.

, With your shotgun pointed at the target and the gun in firing position, the butt firmly in your shoulder, flip the safety off and squeeze the trigger as if you were giving the grip a firm handshake with your firing hand.


Closing your eyes at the moment of firing or jerking the shotgun up by pulling the trigger abruptly is a common mistake when you're just starting out. Keep both of your eyes open to give yourself good ""sight picture,"" meaning that you can focus on the moving target you're trying to hit and maintaining good sight-alignment (the sight post in the aperture). The kick of the shotgun is more significant than most rifles, so it can take some getting used to.

, The difficult thing about shooting clay is that you have to compensate for the speed of the target, which means that you're shooting ahead of the target, not at it. Also, you have to compensate for the ""spread"" of the shotgun, which is the range of the shot in each shell. They have a fairly wide range, which means that you're aiming for the neighborhood of each target, and that you don't have to be directly on it. For this reason, you need to make sure you've got plenty of space with nothing behind it in which to shoot. Gun clubs are the safest bet.


Let the target to pass before you mount the gun onto the line of the target, swinging the gun along its line of travel. Get to the front edge of the target, and squeeze the trigger. Keep swinging and the gun will go off ahead of the target. Focus on the target, and follow through, hold the gun in position for a breath before you lower it, safety it, and check your shot. The whole process is similar to hitting a golf ball: eye on the ball; a good swing and follow through.

"
"
Consider single and double shot options.,
Consider reloading options.,
Choose a gun of a desirable barrel length.,
Consider the gauge.,
Select your choke.",How to Shoot a Shotgun3," Single-shot shotguns are generally the least expensive. They hold one shell at the time, which means you'll have to reload between shots, which can be a negative if you're hunting and need multiple shots.


Double barrel shotguns come in two varieties: over-unders (O/U) with one barrel above another, and side-by-sides, in which the barrels are located horizontally. Some people prefer one style, some the other; neither is ultimately better, and both styles are expensive. Some custom guns will run over $10,000.






Both of these types of guns are ""break action"" shotguns, which means a level will hinge the barrel and the stock open to load and unload manually.

, Pump-action shotguns hold 3-5 ammunition shells at once. To reload, you ""pump"" the slide on the stock and advance another shell into the chamber, ejecting the spent shell and loading another from the magazine tube. This inexpensive gun is known for its reliability and the distinctive sound the pump makes when reloading.


Semi-automatic shotguns load automatically every time the gun is fired. They range anywhere from $300 to $5000 and up.







, For a skeet, target, or hunting shotgun, a long barrel with a choke on it is probably preferred, whereas a home (or personal) defense, a shotgun should probably have a short barrel with little or no choke.


Long barrels allow more of the powder's pressure to accelerate the shot which in turn means higher muzzle velocities and because the pellets have more time to move in a straight path they spread out less. It also makes the shotgun heavier and more difficult (or at least slower) to swing around to aim at fast moving objects. Short barrels are great for close quarters and other situations when pellet spread means less.

, Bore size is also a big consideration as the the heavy 12-, or even 10-, gauge shotguns can be painful to shoot for a weak, small, or untrained user. 16- or 20-gauge shotguns are available which have much less kick and thus are easier to handle for a wider range of users.

, A choke is a section at the end of the barrel which slightly constricts the diameter of the muzzle. The size of the choke changes how wide the spread of the pellets will be. The tighter the choke the tighter the pattern. Loose patterns allow for greater accuracy error, but it also means that at a closer distance your pellets will no longer be affective against your target.


The two types of chokes are fixed chokes and screw-in chokes. Fixed chokes are part of the barrel design and cannot be changed or removed (without major work). The screw-in choke means the end of the barrel is threaded (inside the bore) to allow many different sizes of chokes to be easily replaced.

"
"
Use ""bird shot"" for sport shooting.,
For large game hunting, try Buckshot.,
Get shells of the appropriate size for your gun.,
Consider getting some slugs.,
Note the shot size of your ammunition.",How to Shoot a Shotgun4," There are a wide variety of ammunition options available for the shotgun, and bird shot--made of small pellets poured into a plastic wadding--is most commonly used for shooting clay pigeons on the target range, or small birds like doves.


You can also choose between high-base (also called high-brass) or low-base (also low-brass). High-base (compared to low-base) does not necessarily mean more powder. This is the type of shot you would use against small living creatures such as dove or varmint, where low-base you can use against clays.

, This type uses large pellets (up to 0.38-inches) seated into plastic wadding. The most common type of Buckshot is 00 (pronounced ""double-aught""). 000-buck (triple-aught) is even larger pellets, 0-buck (single-aught) is smaller, the next set of smaller pellets would be #1 buck, then #2 and so on.

, There are three shell sizes. 2-3/4-inch (standard), 3-inch (magnum), and 3-1/2-inch (super-magnum). Most common shotguns support up to 3-inch (shotguns can always shoot smaller shells, but not necessarily larger), but some shoot the 3-1/2-inch which contain much more powder than standard loads and can carry more pellets.

, Slugs are essentially what most think of when they think of a bullet. It is a large piece of lead propelled by powder .Slug power is determined in the same way as Buckshot, with standard, magnum, and super-magnum loadings. With magnum and super-magnum you also have the option of getting a heavier (heavier than 1oz.) slug.


There are two common types of slugs. The ""rifled"" slug is used in shotguns that have a smooth-bore barrel and the sabot slug is used for shotguns with a rifled barrel. Sabot slugs are generally more accurate and higher velocity than rifled slugs, but they require a rifled barrel to be fired accurately, which is less common.

, When you're shopping for ammunition, keep an eye out for the size of the shot listed on the box and get something appropriate for your needs. Just as a 12-gauge is larger than a 20-gauge, #6-shot uses larger pellets than #8-shot.


For shooting clay, a higher shot number (#7-1/2 to #9 shot) is usually preferred as the dense spread of the pellets is more important than the weight of individual pellets. The larger, heavier pellets (#4-#6 shot) is usually reserved for birds and rabbits, because fur and feathers are harder to penetrate than the ceramic of the artificial targets.

Clean the gun after every shooting.To keep your shotgun in good working condition, you'll need to follow this process after you're through shooting every time.,
Break the gun into its primary parts.,
Degrease the gun.,
Swab the barrel.,
Scrub the chokes.,
Wipe the gun down.",How to Shoot a Shotgun5," The powder and the grease from the gun can build up, causing malfunctions in no time. A dirty shotgun is a dangerous shotgun. Clean it.

, Follow the instructions in your owner's manual to break the gun down. If you've got a break action shotgun, you just need to let the gun hinge open and you can clean the gun that way. For a pump action gun, you'll at least need to remove the barrel to clean it.

, Use an aerosol degreaser or solvent designed for guns.Don't use this on any areas with moving parts, like the trigger assembly, but spray a coating of this into the barrel and into the choke tubes.

, Using a rag and a rod to push it through is fine, or you can purchase a Boresnake barrel cleaning device made for the purpose. Make sure the rag or the snake don't snag on anything and leave little cloth chunks in the barrel.

, These will get very dirty, taking the brunt of most of the powder grime that builds up on the gun. Use a rifle brush or an old toothbrush with a little bit of aerosol cleaner sprayed directly onto it.

, With a clean cloth, spot check for any powder or dirt spots that need scrubbing, and wipe the gun down of any excess aerosol spray.

, This is going to be your reloading bible, it will contain the information about which powders to use for a given caliber, which kind of primer to use, and all critical dimensions required for your newly manufactured ammunition.

, You will most likely already have the brass in your possession from once-fired cartridges, or you can purchase newly manufactured brass casings.







Primers. Make sure that you have the right primers for the caliber you are reloading for and the powder you are planning to use. The following primers are available on the market :






Small Pistol (Standard or Magnum)






Large Pistol (Standard or Magnum)






Small Rifle (Standard or Magnum)






Large Rifle (Standard or Magnum)






Extra Large Rifle (Commonly known as the CCI #35, used mostly for 50BMG ammo)






Shotgun Primer (Commonly known as #209 primer, also used in some muzzleloaders)






Note that magnum primers are only to be used if the powder used requires it. Usually, slower powders are harder to ignite and might require magnum priming.



Powder. There are two type of gunpowder, the first is black powder & their substitutes, which are nowadays usually used in muzzleloading rifles or cap-n-ball revolvers, but a few metallic calibers still require black powder. Black powder is mostly made of charcoal, sulphur and saltpeter. The second type of powder is known as smokeless powder, which is usually made out of nitrocellulose, nitroglycerin or a mix of both (the latter being called double based powder). Smokeless powders come in two types, ball powder, which are usually small, shiny black granules, and extruded powder, which looks like little cylinders, of various colors, but usually is in the green-ish palette. The selection of the powder will be made from the data provided in your reloading book.







Bullets. Bullets come in many forms:






Lead bullets : Usually used at low velocities in muzzleloading rifles, or pistols. The hardness of the bullet varies depending of which alloy has been used.
Gas Checked : Lead bullets, generally hard cast (harder alloy), with a small copper disk crimped at the base of the bullet. Gas checked bullets can be pushed at higher velocities than lead bullets
Jacketed bullets : Those are the modern standard, these include Full Metal Jacketed (FMJ), Jacketed Soft Point (JSP), Jacketed Hollow Point (JHP) and many other typed. These bullets can be pushed at much higher velocities than lead & gas checked bullets.
Remember that the weight and the composition of a bullet must always be taken into consideration when selecting the type and the quantity of powder to use.



,, Cleaning the brass is not only for esthetic reasons, but also to get rid of all the particles and debris that might scratch the sizing die and/or the chamber of the firearm.

, This step is only required if you are using steel dies, to reduce the friction between the brass casing and the sizing die. If you are reloading pistol ammunition and purchased carbide sizing die, you may skip the lubrication step. Tungsten carbide is a very hard metal which also provides a very smooth surface, preventing the brass from sticking to it. Rifle casings must always be lubricated prior to sizing regardless of the sizing die's construction.

, This step is usually combined with the sizing step as most sizing dies include an integral decapper. Another option is to use a universal decapping die, which can be used on virtually all calibers.

, When fired, the pressure generated by the burning powder will expand the casing so it contacts with the walls of the firearm's chamber, leaving the ejected casing bigger than it was before firing. These casings need to be resized to their original specifications with the help of a sizing die. There are two type of sizing : Neck sizing, which is only to be used with rifle casings that are used in a bolt action rifle (or other slow-action manually operated rifles), and Full Sizing, which is to be used when reloading for straight-walled cartridges, pistol, or for semi-automatic or fully-automatic firearms.

, This is especially important for bottlenecked rifle calibers, and can usually be skipped for straight-walled or pistol calibers. As the casing is being resized, it will usually stretch and end up longer than it was before sizing. You will need to reduce the length of the casing by trimming the case's mouth. This can be done with various hand tools or some power tools. The trip-to length of a cartridge is provided in the reloading manual.

, Most reloading presses are equipped with a priming device of some sort, or you can also use a hand priming tool.

, This is required if you are loading straight-walled cartridges, or loading non boat-tailed bullets. This is to prevent the casing's mouth from shaving the copper/lead of the bullet being seated. This step is usually integrated to the powder pouring on progressive reloading presses.

, Once you have chosen the type and the quantity or powder to use, you need to measure the quantity. You can weight each and every charge on a scale, or you might want to use a mechanical powder measure. Remember that even if you are using a powder measure, you will still need a scale to calibrate the powder measure and ensure that the right amount of powder is being poured. You should check the powder measure with the scale regularly to ensure that it is still accurate. Powder charges are usually measured in grains (a grain being 1/7000th of a pound, or 0.0648gram)

, This can be done directly from the powder measure, or with funnel.

, Using the correct die (the seating die), you must seat the bullet into the casing. The seating die must be adjusted to the correct level to reach the required Cartridge Overall Length (COAL, or OAL, which is provided in the reloading manual)

, Crimping is only required if the ammunition is to be used in a tubular magazine (on which the cartridges are pushing on each other lengthwise) or if the ammunition is to be used in a firearm with a 'brutal' action, such as a semi-automatic or fully-automatic firearm. There are 2 basic types of crimps: taper and roll. Taper crimp is normally used for semi-automatic firearms that headspace off the case mouth. Roll crimp is normally used for revolver or single shot firearms that head space off the case rim. The reloading dies for the specific cartridge will be factory set for the type of crimp required.

, Insert each case into the loading press. The handle should be positioned up. Lower the handle to resize the case and push the fired primer out. Raise the handle back up, remove the case and place it in a reloading tray. Repeat this step for all the cases.


Some presses have a rotating tray that allows you to load several at once. You'll still want to go through the process of de-capping all of the spent casings before you go loading any of them. It'll be tedious, but worth it in the end.

, Raise the handle to its highest position and place a new primer into the cup of the primer arm. Insert a case into the shell holder. Push the primer arm into the ram slot and lower the case onto the primer.Remove the casing and inspect the primer. It should be flush or slightly lower than the case base.

, Each type of size of shell requires a different variety and weight of powder. It is recommended that you buy a respected loading handbook such as the Alliant Powder Reloader's Guide that covers the calibers you intend to load. Follow their recommendations regarding powder and weight.


Weigh out the correct amount of powder. You can weigh each charge individually or use a volumetric powder measure or calibrated dipper.
Add the powder using a funnel. Discard or return unused powder to the factory container. If it's left on your measurement device or other equipment, the powder can damage it. Keep the reloading area clean and free of powder.

, The seating die pushes a bullet to the proper depth in the neck of the case and crimps the shell. Put one of your casings in the shell holder, lowering the press handle to crimp the casing, securing it in place with the lock ring. Consult the owner's manual for more guidance regarding crimping.Hold a bullet over the open casing with one hand while you lower the press handle with the other. If the bullet needs to be seated deeper into the case, adjust the seater.

, You can also lubricate moving parts on the shell loader with gun oil.

, Secure your reloaded ammunition in a lockbox separate from your firearms. Store the lockbox in a cool, dry location.

, Whether you are reloading spent rifle cartridges or new brass, you want to make sure that you’re starting with clean brass. Inspect your cartridges for cleanliness and determine the level of attention they deserve. You may use a case tumbler (most common method) or you may use soap and water but, avoid harsh chemicals as they may react with your metallic casings and damage them. Make sure your casings are dry before proceeding.


It’s much more important to clean the outside of the case rather than the inside of the case.;
, Cases from different manufacturers are too different to provide the kind of accuracy we are looking for. Settle on developing a load for one headstamp and set the other cases aside for plinking.


If you're using rifle cases that have already been reloaded 2 to 4 times, they may have become work-hardened. Now is a great time to anneal them.

, Regardless of whether or not you are using new or used brass, you should resize your brass. Since uniformity and consistency translates to accuracy on the range, the goal is create as much uniformity as possible between this set of reloads and the next as you get better at tailoring your reloads to your specific rifle.


Due to the differences between equipment manufacturers, be sure to follow the usage instructions for setting up your resizing die as outlined in the manual since doing so will insure that you achieve the correct resizing dimensions for your cartridge.
During this stage, you will also notice that the old primers will be punched out of the bottom of the case and the primer pocket will be empty. This is normal, we will replace the primers after case preparation is complete.
When resizing the brass, you need to lubricate your brass but, avoid lubricating it all at once. Lubricants can dry and harden and introduce modest inconsistencies as you resize your brass cases. Instead, lubricate as needed, as you go. Then, wipe away the excess lubricant from resized cases before it dries. Also, clean the excess lubricant from the resizing die when you done.

, If you’re using new brass, you should already have clean primer pockets and be able to skip this step. If you’re working with brass from ammunition that has been previously fired, the resizing die will have removed the old primer from the bottom of the case during the resizing process. The empty primer pocket from one of these cases will be dirty and fouled with soot after the process of ignition and should be cleaned before a new primer is installed. A clean primer pocket will insure that the process of seating a new primer is easy and results in a tight and even seal at the back of the case.


If you’re using military brass, you may need to also ream the primer pocket to remove military crimps or rough metal edges from primer pockets. Now is a good time to do that.

, Never skip this this step when reloading bottlenecked brass. Now that the cases have been resized using the resizing die, you need to carefully trim each one to insure they are all uniform in length. Again, consistency is the key to improving accuracy. With practice, you should have no trouble turning cases down to a uniform length that is accurate to 0.001”.


Check your reloading manual for the suggested trim length of your specific cartridge.
Also, be sure to follow the instructions for use as outlined by your manufacturer since there are a wide variety of case trimmers.
Make sure that you are carefully following the manufacturer's instructions for operation and that you’re using good quality calipers to check the length of your cases.
Making sure that your case trimmer is mounted to a solid surface will increase the consistency of your trimmed length.
Check the length of your trimmed cases often to guard against any over-trimming that may result from loosening of the settings on your case trimmer. If parts on the trimmer become loose with use, be sure to keep them tight.

, After trimming, any burrs and sharp edges on the outside of the mouth of the case should be removed. Be careful to not remove much material since you do not want to change the length of the case. All you want to do is smooth the outside edge of the case mouth and remove the sharp edge and burrs.


Try to give all cases the same treatment. Deburring can have a slight effect on the bullet crimp later in the reloading process, which can have a modest effect on the accuracy of the cartridge.

, The process of chamfering a case cuts a small chamfer on the inside of the mouth of the case which allows bullets to easily be seated in the cartridge without any damage caused by sharp edges and burrs.

, Look for uniformity of length and discard any cases that may be significantly shorter than the suggested minimum case length as suggested by your reloading manual.

, As long as the cartridges are approximately the same length, a measurement of their weight will be a good indicator of the case capacity. Record a measurement of the weight of each cartridge and take the average of the lot. Set aside those cases with a weight of +/- 0.5 grains or more in difference from the average case weight.


You may have significantly reduced the number of cases you have to reload for this lot. That’s the price of precision and accuracy but now you have grown your separate lot of brass for plinking purposes.
Having a uniform case capacity across your lot of brass is important for the purposes of having uniform pressures inside the case when the rounds will be fired. This is an important step for increasing the accuracy of your ammunition that requires a discerning eye and careful attention to detail. Don't waste your time and blame your trigger finger at the range.

, Before you move on to charging each case, we need to do a final inspection of our cases and set aside those with irregularities.


Set aside any other cases which have irregular flash holes that are poorly cut or poorly centered in the primer pocket. These are now for plinking.
Check each individual case for damage that may have been caused during the case preparation process (such as hairline cracks) and discard those cases that cannot be mended.
Cases that have scrapes which may inhibit proper functioning of the rifle now become decorative souvenirs and Christmas tree ornaments.
If you've reloaded your cases 2 to 4 times now, you may have noticed at the end of this process that they have become a bit work-hardened and may need to be annealed. Since you've minimized the size of your lot, now is a good time to anneal your cases if you haven't done so already.

, Now that your cases have been properly prepared, you can now begin the process of charging the round by priming your cases. This part should be relatively simple. Make sure the primers seat firmly into the primer pocket and flush with the bottom of the case because doing so will ensure they form a uniformly tight seal.


If the primer does not fit snuggly in the primer pocket, throw the case away.
Attention to consistency in this step becomes more important as pressures increase with more powerful loads.

, For the purposes of accuracy, this is arguably one of the most critical parts of the reloading process. For the best results, either use a high quality electronic scale that has the ability to trickle powder or, use an analog scale and trickle the powder up to the exact charge weight.


Avoid using the recommended maximum loads in your manual because they leave too little room for error.
Lower power compressed charge weights with are recommended for precision shooting because they ensure that the powder will not shift during the operation of the rifle and generally result in more uniform ignition. Also, compressed loads generally require a crimp to keep the bullet from working it’s way out of the case.
Using a slightly faster burning rifle powder for your cartridge can help to ensure that all the powder is burned before the bullet leaves the barrel. In this condition, you may see the most uniformity in performance between rounds. Be careful though, powders that are too quick may rob you of velocity and thus, terminal performance. Compare charging information from the manufacturer carefully and weigh your options.
If you are used to reloading pistol cartridges then you may notice how shockingly full your rifle cases appear to be with powder. This is normal for rifle cartridges as long as the powder is a slow burning powder that is recommended for use in your rifle cartridge. Do not go above or below the recommended charges recommended by your reloading manual.

, As a precaution, do not skip this step. Visually inspect each case and make sure that each case is charged and that all charges look the same. Once you are satisfied with the consistency of your charges, move on to the next step.

, Inspect your bullet seating die to make sure it is clean and extend your bullet seating pin as far out of the die as it will go, do not remove it from the die.

, Insert a trimmed case into the case holder and actuate the press into the up position so that the case is poking through the area where the die will be placed. This case should be checked to make sure it is approximately the average case length of your lot and preferably the same as the case trim length

, Once you feel the the die engage the case mouth, back it out one eighth of a turn and lock the die into place.

, If the bullet is not pushed downward firmly into the mouth of the case, lower the bullet seating pin until you meet resistance. Back the cartridge out of the die and lower the bullet seating pin by two more turns and actuate the press again, pressing the bullet firmly into place.

, Compare the cartridge length with the length of the magazine and incrementally adjust the die until the bullet is seated deep enough into the case to fit into the magazine.

, Gently chamber the round and apply very little force as the round slides into battery. If you encounter any force before the chamber can be completely closed, back the cartridge out of the action and seat the bullet a little deeper in the case. Repeat this step until the cartridge can be chambered completely.

, Now that the cartridge can be fit into battery, we are ready to use the ""sharpie test"" (most common) to seat the bullet precisely to the depths of the lands (no more or less). Color the tip of the bullet with with a sharpie marker and load it into the magazine of the rifle you will be using. At this point, the bullet should be slightly engaging the lands of the bore of the barrel when chambered. These lands will disturb the sharpie ink and leave marks on the bullet which indicate contact. Using very small increments, seat the bullet slightly deeper into the case until a round can be chambered without creating these marks. This should result in a cartridge that has an overall length that is custom fitted to your rifle where the bullet is seated just off the lands of the bore of the barrel.


The point of this procedure is to find the cartridge length which will allows the bullet to remain supported as it leaves the case mouth and enters the bore of the rifle barrel during firing. Therefore, extreme precision tools are not required though you can spend your money on them anyway if it makes you feel better.
This test should be repeated if you change the configuration of your rifle or if you change case or bullet models.

, Once the correct length is achieved, lock down the die with one or two die lock rings to preserve this setting.

, Now that you've dialed in your rifle's ideal settings, go ahead and finish making this lot of cartridges. Head to the local range and see how they perform but, be sure preserve your die settings when you're done and make good record of your load's recipe. You should now consider load development methods that will help you tune your powder charge to your rifle.

Dry erase markers are great for those who want to remove permanent ink from their cartridges without exposing their ammunition to solvents. Simply draw over the permanent ink with the dry erase marker and wipe away the residue.

Assemble the necessary materials.,
Check your empty shells for reusable hulls.,
Deprime your shells.,
Consult a reload guide for load sizes.,
Rotate the shell plate to load the shell with primer and powder.,
Seat the wadding and the shot.,
Crimp the shell.",How to Reload Ammo2," Each shotgun shell consists of five basic components, somewhat less complex than the materials available for reloading brass.To reload empty shot shells, you'll need:


Empty hulls, checked for wear
Plastic wadding of the appropriate gauge
Shot of the desired ""shot number""
Primers
Shotshell powder

, The only reusable component of the shotgun shell is the plastic shell itself, what is ejected from the shotgun after firing a round. To find reusable hulls, look for signs of wear around the mouth of the shell. They should be relatively uniform, rounded and intact plastic casings to reload.


Hold potential reload hulls up to the light and examine the mouth of each for splits and substantial wear along the crimping. If it's too torn up, you won't be able to use it to properly crimp back down, resulting in a faulty shell.
Generally, it's a good idea to throw away shells that have been stepped on or jammed with mud in some way. Shells that come from break-open shotguns that allow you to remove the empty shells directly from the gun are your safest bet. Put them directly into a box or bag to keep them, if you want to reload.

, When you fit the empty shell into the slot on your reloader, the first step is relatively simple. Pull the lever, and the uncapping pin will remove the spent cap from the empty shell, also resizing the casing to proper specifications. If the shell has warped some in transport, this step should round it back out some.

, The safest way to make sure that you're reloading your shells to the proper specifications is to consult a trusty reload guide like the Alliant Guide. Included will be a rundown of powder weights, shot types, and primers used in all brands and varieties of shells. If you're planning on reloading regularly, it's essential to invest in one of these guides.

, Each reloader will work differently, so you might check your owner's manual from your reloading press for a proper guide.


Most reload guides call for Red Dot shotshell powder for use in reloading, of a varying amount.12 ga. shells are usually loaded with between 16 and 25 grains of powder.
Most reloaders have a rotating plate that allows you to keep a load of each necessary ""ingredient"" queued up, allowing you to work relatively quickly. To advance between the steps, you simply rotate the plate and pull the handle again. You can go as quickly as you can do that simple action.

, Rotate the plate again and use the lever to insert your plastic wadding and the appropriate amount of sized shot for your variety of shell.


You've got some choice in the matter when it comes to what shot you want to load your shells with, depending on your purposes. 12 gauge shells generally use size 7.5, 8, or 9 size shot, sold in big 25 pound bags. The smaller the number, the larger the little lead balls. If you're shooting for sport, 8 or 9 is generally better, while you might want size 7.5 if you're hunting or reloading for some other purpose.

, Rotate the reloader again to crimp the shells closed, securing the completed shell. Store them in shotshell trays, widely available at sporting goods stores or other outlets, or just put them back in the old boxes that the shells came in.


If you've altered the shells in any way--using different sizes of shot or made other manual-approved modifications--make note of it on the box so you know what you're shooting.

Choose a comfortable pistol firing stance.,
Get a good grip.,
Find good sight picture.,
Establish sight alignment.,
Manage the pistol’s recoil.,
Follow through with your shots.",How to Shoot a Gun Accurately1," Firing a pistol accurately starts at your feet. Three are three common stances to choose from when firing a pistol accurately. The right stance for you will depend on your level of comfort, your natural firing position, and preference. The isosceles stance involves positioning your feet evenly about shoulder width apart. The weaver stance uses staggered footing, with the foot on your dominant side set back and your lead foot pointed at the target. The fighting stance bridges the gap between the two, placing your feet shoulder width apart and with your dominant side foot only slightly behind your lead foot.In all three positions, the shooter extends the weapon directly out in front of them.
Each position has advantages and disadvantages and it’s recommended that beginner shooters try all three to see which feels the most stable for them.;
, Always use two hands when firing a pistol. Your dominant hand should seat high on the handle of the pistol and you should extend your trigger finger along the side of the weapon. Your non-dominant hand should be slightly lower, wrapping around the handle. Do not place your non dominant hand on the bottom of the pistol, as it will prevent you from ejecting a spent magazine when reloading quickly.The web of your dominant hand (span of skin between your thumb and index finger) should be aligned with the wrist to properly absorb recoil.
Squeeze the pistol in your hands firmly, but not too tight. If your knuckles turn white, you are squeezing the pistol too hard.

, Most pistols come equipped with a front sight tip and rear sight aperture. The front sight tip is the small post sticking up from the end of the barrel of the gun. When you raise the pistol, focus on the front sight tip and ensure it is centered on your target. Having the front sight tip centered on the target is referred to as getting proper “sight picture.”In close quarters situations, acquiring sight picture is often sufficient to accurately engage a target.
Sight picture is imperative to accuracy. A common saying in military training is, “in a gun fight, you have the rest of your life to acquire good sight picture.”

, If your target is further than a few feet away, you will need to couple sight picture with proper sight alignment. Sight alignment occurs when you position the weapon so the front sight tip is centered between the two posts that make up the rear sight aperture near the back of the weapon. When the front sight tip and rear sight aperture are aligned, this creates sight alignment, meaning the weapon is level and not angled in any way.The front sight tip and rear sight aperture should be of even height, meaning neither appears to sit higher than the other in your perspective.
With good sight alignment and sight picture, the target should be blurry behind the front sight tip, which is centered in your vision between the two posts of the rear sight aperture.

, As you squeeze the trigger, the firing pin will strike the back of the round, igniting the gun powder and sending the round down range. This contained explosion is directed out the barrel, which in turn tries to push the weapon backwards. This counter force when firing a weapon is called recoil. Manage recoil by combing a proper firing stance with a good grip. As soon as you fire the weapon, quickly regaining sight picture and alignment will eliminate issues caused by recoil.The design of the weapon, the type of ammunition, and the caliber of the weapon can all effect the amount of recoil your pistol produces.

, After firing a round, do not immediately re-holster your weapon or move to acquire a new target. Instead focus on the target even after releasing the round. This will prevent you from accidentally sending a round off course by moving before the round has left the barrel.Even a tiny amount of movement can send a round off target at a distance.
Wait a second before moving on to a new target or lowering your weapon.

Coat the gun parts with oil.",How to Reblue a Gun," If most of the original bluing is still in place, you may be able to touch up the bluing yourself with a cold bluing kit. If most of the original bluing has worn away, you may want to consider removing the rest of the old bluing and hot bluing the gun metal.;
, Vintage guns dating back to the 19th century were blued using either the rust bluing or fume bluing process. These processes are not used commercially today because of the amount of time involved. There are products commercially available that will let you perform the rust bluing process yourself, or you can find someone who will perform this process for you.


Vintage guns that feature silver soldering or brazing cannot be hot-blued, because the caustic salts used in this process will eat the silver. Double-barreled shotguns commonly used this kind of soldering or brazing to keep the barrels aligned properly., Hot bluing costs significantly more than cold bluing does, so you need to consider the cost of the re-bluing process you plan to use against what you spent to acquire the gun in the first place and its resale value if you were to sell it.


You should also consider the intrinsic value of the gun, or what it means to you, as well as its actual monetary value. If the gun is a family heirloom, you may want to consider spending more money on re-bluing the gun, even if its monetary value is the same that of a gun purchased at a sporting goods store., In addition to the monetary and intrinsic value of the gun that needs re-bluing, you should also take into account the costs of the bluing process you are considering using.


Cold bluing, described in Part Two of this article, is the simplest of the processes, and therefore the cheapest, but it is also the least durable. If you plan to handle the gun a lot after cold bluing it, you can expect the cold bluing to wear off fairly quickly.
Hot bluing, described in Part Three of this article, is more durable than cold bluing and lasts longer than either cold bluing or rust bluing, but it requires more work and more equipment to perform. If you feel the gun deserves to be hot blued, but you find the work involved too daunting to do yourself, you may want to hire it done.
Rust bluing, described in Part Four of this article, is somewhat less materials-intensive than hot bluing, but more materials-intensive than cold bluing. It is also the most time-intensive of the bluing processes, as you have to let the gun metal rest for a time to achieve the level of coloring you want. Again, you may want to hire someone to rust-blue your gun if you find the process too daunting to do yourself.

, Depending on how worn the original bluing is, you may wish to remove it entirely before re-bluing the gun. You can use one of the following chemicals to do so:


A phosphoric acid-based automotive rust remover, such as Naval Jelly.
White vinegar, which contains acetic acid., Polishing removes surface rust and any scratches or pitting that the gun may have suffered over the years. You can use either 000 steel wool or 600 to 1200-grit sandpaper for this purpose.

, How you choose to clean the metal depends on whether you plan to blue the entire gun or touch up existing bluing.


If you plan to blue the entire gun, you may want to immerse the metal in a cleaning solution. Cleaning solutions you can use for this purpose include sodium triphosphate (a commercial detergent), denatured alcohol, or naphtha.(If you choose to use naphtha, you should wash it off with a mild dishwashing detergent and then rinse with hot water.)If you plan to immerse the gun parts to clean them, you can use a wire basket to hold the small parts and thread thin wire through the barrel to lower it into the cleaning solution and raise it again.
If you plan to just touch up existing bluing, you can apply a cleaning oil to the places where you want to remove the old bluing, then apply acetone on cotton balls to remove the cleaning oil. (One such cleaning oil, a mixture of vegetable and mineral oils, alcohol, benzyl acetate, and alkaline salts, is sold commercially under the name Ballistol.)As you clean off the old bluing, you may find some scarring that will require sanding or polishing out.

, Although this process is called cold bluing, gently heating the gun metal before applying the bluing can help it absorb the bluing better and create a better finish. Heat the metal by leaving it out in the sun for several hours, with a heat gun or blow dryer, or in a conventional oven set to its lowest setting., Slowly apply the solution to the area to be blued as evenly as possible, using a clean applicator. Apply the solution in a single pass to cover small areas, or in sections no larger than 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5 cm) when covering large areas, then smooth it out using steel wool. This will prevent the bluing from appearing mottled. For applying the bluing to large areas, old all-cotton T-shirts or new toothbrushes are recommended. For smaller areas, use a cotton ball, cotton swab, or flat toothpick no larger than the area to be covered.
You can soak small parts like screws or hard to cover areas in the bluing solution. If you don’t have enough bluing solution to soak a recessed area, put it in a clean spray bottle and spray it liberally on the part over a glass pan or plastic tray. After the part is completely covered, you can pour the solution that landed on the pan or tray instead of the gun metal back into the bottle and reuse it., Apply each layer with a fresh applicator, and use a fresh piece of steel wool to smooth out each new layer.


The more layers you apply the darker the bluing will be; however, each new layer is progressively less effective than the layer before it. Seven layers should be enough, in most cases, to achieve a dark blue-black finish. If you have spots that won’t darken, start the process over by sanding the spots with 320 to 400-grit sandpaper before applying the solution again. Try to sand no more than the stubborn spots themselves.

, Apply a layer of gun oil every few hours, using a cotton ball to remove the previous layer before applying a new layer. (In essence, you’re washing off the bluing solution with the gun oil instead of with water.)


Do not use the cleaning oil for this process, as it will take off the bluing you worked so hard to put on., Again, you can use either 000 steel wool or 600 to 1200-grit sandpaper to polish the metal., While the cleaning solution you use may not require it, the chemicals used in the hot bluing process proper, normally potassium nitrate and sodium hydroxide, are highly caustic. You’ll find it easier to dip the gun barrel if you thread soft wire through it and easier to dip the smaller parts if you put them in a wire basket.


Rigging the parts now before the cleaning step will make it easier to transfer from the cleaning to the bluing tank, and will also clean the support wire and basket to prevent either from contaminating the gun parts in the bluing tank.

, Parts should be immersed in the bath for 10 to 15 minutes and scrubbed while being immersed to remove any oil, dirt, or grease that could get in the way of the bluing process. You can use any of the chemical cleaners listed in the cleaning step for cold bluing, provided you read and follow all directions for the cleaner’s use, handling, and disposal.

, Rinsing should take no more than 2 to 3 minutes.


If you’ve used dishwashing detergent to remove the cleaning chemical, you may instead need to use hot water to rinse., The hot bluing solution, known as “Traditional Caustic Black.”, must be heated to a temperature of from 275 to 311 degrees F (135 to 155 degrees C).


Before heating the bluing solution, stir it thoroughly to break up any salt clumps that may occur on the surface or at the bottom of the tank holding the solution.
When dipping gun barrels in bluing solution, dip them at an angle to allow any air bubbles that may form to escape. Be sure to immerse the barrel completely.
Swirl the metal basket containing smaller gun parts around in the solution to ensure the parts are completely coated with the bluing solution.
Leave the gun parts in the bluing solution from 15 to 30 minutes. Check to see when the metal has reached the desired shade of bluing and remove it from the solution at that time.
If your gun has stainless steel parts, those parts are immersed in a different chemical solution, a mixture of nitrates and chromates. It is heated to similar temperatures as the nitrate-hydroxide mixture., Swirl the parts through the cold water to help wash away the bluing salts.

, This will boil off any remaining bluing solution residue. Simple parts need to be immersed for 5 to 10 minutes, while complex or ornate parts may need to be immersed for up to 30 minutes.


If the gun has any soldered parts, you can apply a chemical to these parts that will color the soldering to match the rest of the metal. Use a cotton swab for this.

, This will protect the finish from rust, sweat, and body oil. Leave the parts in the oil bath for 45 to 60 minutes, until they have cooled., Again, steel wool or 600 to 1200-grit sandpaper will work to remove any loose rust, scarring, or pitting from the gun metal.

, You can use any of the cleaners listed in the cleaning step under the cold bluing process, unless the manufacturer of the rust bluing solution you’re using says differently. After you’ve used the cleaning solution, rinse it off.

, The rust bluing solution is typically a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acid. This solution actually encourages the metal to rust, but to do so in a uniform manner.


Instead of coating the parts with the acid solution, you can instead place an opened container of the acid solution with the gun parts in a cabinet and seal it for a period of 12 hours. The acid evaporates from its container and condenses around the gun metal. This method is called fume bluing.
Another variation is to coat the gun metal parts with the rust bluing solution and then put them into a fume cabinet (or, in this case, a damp cabinet) for the same 12 hours. Often, a first layer is applied as a primer before coating the parts a second time and then placing them in the damp cabinet., This stops the rusting process by removing the acid solution.

, The surface rust is normally removed with a carding brush or wheel, which features very soft and thin wire bristles.

, In some cases, the metal may develop as deep a coloring as it can, making further bluing attempts counterproductive.

, The oil inhibits the formation of rust and protects the metal finish from dirt, sweat, body oil, and wear. Once you’ve applied the oil, let the parts stand overnight before assembling."

Stay calm.,
Call for help.,
Gather your peers.,
Get away from the attacker.,
Get inside the room.,
Cover up the windows.,
Block the door.,Cover all windows and doors the best that you can, but be quick and be quiet about it and make sure that the shooter does not see you do it.,
Help the injured.,
Contact emergency services again.,
Keep low and wait for help.,
Escort your party to the assembly point.",How to Protect People During a School Shooting," When you find out that there is a gunman on the loose at your school, try your hardest to remain calm. While your first instinct may be to cry, shout or run, this will only draw the shooter's attention to you and your peers, increasing the chances of being shot or taken hostage.


Remain calm and escort everyone to safety, or follow the teacher's instructions if you are a pupil. If you're calm, the people around you will automatically believe that you have a good idea of what to do and that following you is their best bet. This means you can maximize the amount of people in your party and save many more lives.;
, Call the emergency services from your mobile (UK number: 999: USA number: 911) and ask for the police.


The school office may have already done this; however in a crisis it can be difficult to know if it has been done, or what the situation is in that part of the school. If multiple calls are logged about the problem, it's better than none at all. Ideally, try to remember the name of the officer you spoke to, or a case file number if they give you one.
Switch your phone to silent mode as soon as this is done and encourage others to do so. Well-meaning parents will almost instantly phone their child in a crisis, and the ringtone can draw unwanted attention from the shooter to your whereabouts.

, If you're in a classroom at the time the shooting starts, be sure to take everyone with you, including as many teachers as you can. Chances are, at least one teacher at your school is trained in first aid and can help somebody that is injured better than you can.


Make sure that the teachers are calm too; your peers will only get scared if they see that even your teachers are frightened.
If you're not in a classroom, look around you to see who is there. If you see a child that is on their own, make sure you take them with you. That being said, if nobody is around you, don't go looking for people. Follow the next few steps alone.

, Now that you've gathered as many people that you possible can, get as far away from the attacker as possible. This will minimize your chances of getting injured or even noticed by the gunman. In all three of the following scenarios, you want to be running towards a room big enough to fit everybody in there. If you can help it, choose one with tables, chairs and cupboards to hide in.


If the gunner has not yet noticed you and is preoccupied doing something else, run in the opposite direction as fast as you can, but try to be quiet so that the attacker doesn't hear you.
If they have spotted you already, forget all stealth and run for your life.
If they have their weapon up, ready to shoot, and you are right in their line of fire, run in a zig-zag motion and always keep moving.

, Don't bust in there and lock the door. Even though it could save your own life, many others will die. Remember, they're somebody's child too, even the teachers. Let everybody else enter the room before you, constantly checking if the gunman is nearby. If you do spot the gunman, force the remaining students and teachers into the room and lock the door.


Once everybody is inside, lock the door and check to make sure that nobody is hurt or in a panic.

, If the gunman will attack from anywhere, it won't be the door. This is because by the time he kicks the door down, you can escape out of the window. Instead, the gunner will probably climb in through the window or pull children out through the window.


Shut the windows tight, make sure they're locked, pull the blinds shut, and start barricading them. If there is wood in the classroom, try to use a sheet of hardwood to cover up the windows. This will absorb any bullets better than a wood like plywood.
If possible, hide under a desk or in a suitable large cupboard if the shooter starts shooting at the windows. Just like in an earthquake scenario, the desk will offer some degree of protection from flying and broken glass. If you remain silent, the chances are higher they will not see you and assume the class is empty. Your hiding space should ideally be large enough so you can exit quickly if needed.

, Like the windows, start to cover up the door.


If there is a glass panel in the door, make sure that is covered up.
Block out any gaps in the door that can fit the barrel (the part where the bullets come out from) of the shooter's weapon.
If there is a heavy teacher's desk in the room, work together to push it in front of the door. This will avoid it being kicked down. After you've done that, pile everything you can find on top of the desk. Be it more desks, chairs or even speakers and computers. Money means nothing in a situation like this.

,, Now that you're completely safe in your room, attend to any students or teachers that may have been injured while getting to this point. Even if it's just a paper cut, hold some tissue over it for them until they stop bleeding. Obviously, attend to more seriously injured people before attending to them. If there is a first aid kit nearby, feel free to use it. If one of the teachers is qualified in first aid, though, leave all of the bandaging limbs and dressing wounds to them.


If somebody has been shot, know how to attend to a bullet wound, or make sure a teacher knows how to.

, While somebody else is attending to the injured people in your party, another person, or you, can call for help.


If somebody in your group is injured, call an ambulance too; calling an ambulance is never a bad idea. There could be somebody else out there that needs help. Keep quiet when talking on the phone; you don't want the gunner to hear that you've called the police on them.
It can be useful for the police to get an update on the situation, as that way they have insider knowledge about the situation and how they may best handle the situation. However, use your discretion about when and where you do this.

, Although the windows and doors are boarded up, there is still a chance that a stray bullet can pierce the barricades. Stay out of the line of the windows and the doors.


If there are windows all around your room, lay yourself flat underneath them so you can't be seen. Advise others to do the same. If they don't want to lay down, at least advise them to sit down. Walking around or standing up is a very bad idea, as it gives the attacker a sign that there are people in the room.
Wait quietly; try to keep the crying to a minimum. When the corridor is silent, it will be heard very easily. However, cuddling somebody that is very scared and reassuring them is not a bad idea either. Wait like this until you get the all clear.

, After a while, you may get a call on your mobile phone to tell you that the attacker has been arrested or killed and it's safe to come out.


Make sure that this isn't the attacker luring you out by asking questions like ""can I speak to "". Even if you make up a name, the attacker will be stuck and won't know what to say. Another question you can ask is ""am I the only child that you're waiting for?"". Obviously, there are about 30 of you in the room so you won't be the only child that they're still waiting for. If the reply is ""yes"", remain calm and tell the gunner that you're on your way, but do not leave the room. If the reply seems legitimate, keep your party calm and escort them to the assembly point.
Always get yourself and your students checked by first aid teams so they may assess the most high-need cases in the school. Attend counseling if it is available. Generally, the mind's own survival mode can kick in during a crisis and reduce panic, but this same panic may eventuate after the event, especially if lives were lost.

Get sight picture and alignment with iron sights.,
Acquire your target using a scope.,
Adjust elevation for accuracy.,
Change windage based on your environment.,
Support the weapon properly.",How to Shoot a Gun Accurately2," Iron sights on a rifle work in the same way the front sight tip and rear sight aperture work on a pistol. Ensure the front sight tip is centered on the target, and is centered in your view between the two tips of the rear sight aperture. This ensures your weapon is even and level.Rifle sight tips and rear sight aperture are often adjustable, as is uncommon with pistols. This allows you to adjust your sights to improve your accuracy.
You should sight in your rifle to make sure it is aimed exactly where you intend.
Sight picture and alignment also pertains to firing shotguns.

, Rifle scopes magnify your target to make it easier to aim at a specific point. Using a rifle scope can dramatically increase your accuracy over long distances as long as the weapon is properly sighted in and you practice solid shooting fundamentals. Establish sight picture in a rifle scope by centering the reticle of the scope on your target, and ensuring the circle you look through at the end of the scope is centered in your view through it.You can purchase scopes with varying levels of magnification based on the distance you intend to shoot.
The higher the magnification of the scope, the more difficult it can be to establish proper sight picture.

, You can adjust the elevation on a rifle scope by twisting the elevation knob. While there are many different brands of scopes, the elevation knob is commonly on the top of the scope. Turning the knob to the right will raise the point your round impacts the target. Turning the knob to the left will lower it.If you are firing at a further distance than the weapon is zeroed for, you will need to increase the elevation in the scope to compensate for the round dropping in height as it travels between your weapon and the target.
The elevation knob adjusts where your rounds will impact on the vertical axis (up and down).

, The windage knob is often located on the right side of a rifle scope and adjusts the impact point of the round on the horizontal axis (from left to right). If you are firing into a strong wind, you should adjust the windage into the wind to compensate for how the wind will push the round as it travels to the target. Turning the knob to the right will bring the rounds further to the right and vice versa.Depending on the rifle, ammunition, scope and distance from the target, adjustments to your windage will move the round different amounts for each click of the knob.
Look at the area between you and your target for signs of strong winds, then adjust your windage to suit.

, Always make sure the buttstock of the rifle is seated firmly in your shoulder. Place your dominant hand high on the pistol grip of the rifle or the buttstock where you can comfortable reach the trigger. Use your other hand to support the weapon. Whenever possible, use a bipod, sandbag or other stable object to rest the rifle on to prevent it from moving. If you are firing from a standing position, wear a tight sling that helps keep the rifle planted in your shoulder.Moving the barrel of the weapon even slightly can result in missing your target by feet over a large distance.
Try to use your bones to support the weapon instead of muscle. Fire from a seated or prone position when possible with your elbows resting on your knees or the ground to eliminate wobble created by tiring muscles.
Shoulder a shotgun in the same way you would shoulder a rifle.

Utilize proper trigger control.,
Practice breath control.,
Start with your natural point of aim.,
Understand the rules of firearm safety.,
Always wear the appropriate safety gear.",How to Shoot a Gun Accurately3," Despite the common phrase “pull the trigger,” you should never pull a trigger on a rifle or pistol. Always squeeze the trigger with slow, steady pressure. Pulling a trigger can alter the direction the weapon is pointed slightly, and although the shift may be difficult to notice as you fire, it will be evident when your round fails to impact where you intended. Try counting to three or five in your head as you slowly squeeze the trigger, then leave the trigger pulled for a one count before releasing it.Pulling a trigger can cause the weapon to jerk slightly, while a controlled squeeze allows you to keep the weapon on target.
Act as though you are attempting to close your fist through the weapon’s handle to squeeze the trigger instead of pulling it.

, As you breath, your lungs fill with air and then expel it, which can also affect your ability to keep the weapon on target. To combat this, you should always fire during the natural pause between exhaling and inhaling. Time your shot so you squeeze the trigger after you exhale, then don’t breath in again until the round has been fired.You move the weapon slightly as you breath, and although it may be difficult to notice, it can have a dramatic effect on your accuracy downrange.
Maintaining calm, steady breathing is important to ensuring you fire accurately, so practice firing during the natural pause between breaths instead of holding your breath as you fire.

, When you first raise your weapon and look through the sights, it is often not quite on target. This is your natural point of aim, and it’s where your body naturally wants to point the weapon. Don’t fight this natural point of aim, and instead, shift your entire body so your body wants to point the weapon directly as the target. Fighting against the natural point of aim can tire your muscles out and make it difficult to fire accurately.If you find your natural point of aim is off to the left of the target, lower the weapon and move your feet to turn your whole body a bit to the right, then raise the weapon again.
Finding your natural point of aim, then centering it on the target will make firing accurately much easier.

, There are four common rules of firearm safety that you should exercise any time you are around firearms. These rules were established to keep you and those around you safe. These rules are taught and exercised at firearm ranges, in law enforcement and the military, and work for all weapon applications. The four rules of firearm safety are:Treat every weapon as if it were loaded.
Never point a weapon at anything you do not intend to shoot.
Keep your finger straight and off the trigger until you are ready to fire.
Keep the weapon on safe until you are ready to fire.

, Whenever you are firing a weapon, it’s important that you wear the appropriate eye and ear protection. Eye protection will prevent expelled shells from hitting you in the eyes and protect you if the weapon were to suffer a malfunction. Ear protection will prevent you from suffering hearing loss or ruptured ear drums as a result of the loud sounds of gunfire.Look for ballistic rated or shatterproof eye protection.
You can purchase ear protection that goes over the ear or inside it; either are acceptable.

List your gun.,
Always ask for I.D.,
Write up a bill of sale.,
Agree to a safe location.",How to Privately Sell a Gun in Virginia," There are many websites and print publications that will list your firearm for sale. Local trading posts may charge a fee, but you'll probably get the most local exposure. Vaguntrader.com is a free member forum where you can list your firearm for sale anywhere in the Commonwealth. Stay away from craigslist and Facebook Marketplace; a firearm listing is against user terms and is likely to get deleted.;
, It is only legal to privately sell a handgun to a Virginia state resident; 18 years of age or older. Long guns like rifles and shotguns may be sold to individuals 18 years of age and up. For FFL gun trades They have to be 21 years or older for handguns

, This should include the buyer's and seller's information; driver's license or concealed carry permit (if applicable) number, home address (optional), and phone number; information on the firearm; make, model, and serial number; and the date of sale with both parties signatures. You may want to optionally include notes stating that the firearm is sold ""as-is"", and that the buyer is legally eligible to purchase a firearm; seller and buyer would sign respective statements. Don't worry, folks; there are templates already made up and available online.

, It might be good to meet in a private place of business or residence. This is especially true if you plan to sit and discuss the firearms before the transaction. The general public tend to get nervous when they see guns. Be sure to know the rules before transporting your guns in a vehicle. A good practice is unloading and safely packing them in a locked gun case before transport.

White: condition white is a state of unreadiness, you are oblivious to your surroundings.,
Yellow: in condition yellow the environment is observed and while a fight does not look imminent, it is still a thought in your mind.,
Orange: occurs when there is the possibility of threat but a source has yet to be identified.,
Red: this is the condition where your ""mental trigger"" has been tripped and you are taking action against a very specific adversary (or adversaries).,
Black: this is the condition you end up in at the end of the confrontation.",How to Read the Color Code of the Tactical (Combat) Mindset,"



White may characterized by daydreaming, self-concentration, looking at the ground, or concentrating mindlessly on any single subject.
This condition is the optimal time for any assailant to make their move as the victim will not see the action coming and will be caught by complete surprise.
Even the unarmed citizen should never be caught in this capacity, because many bad situations could be prevented just from a person being aware of their setting.;
,


Observations should include suspicious characters, watching what is behind you (from behind is the easiest way to take someone by surprise), and looking for general areas of cover (if something were to suddenly come up, you know where to move immediately).

Yellow is the state any concerned citizen should be in at any given time. While obviously this isn't possible (as everyone's mind wanders from one time to another), striving to see general environmental cues could save you the hassle of a fight.
Attackers are often wary about moving in on someone who is obviously in condition yellow. They notice that you are noticing them and would rather not risk anything when they can easily find someone in condition white.
By default, arming yourself with a weapon means you are always in condition yellow or higher. You should never be in condition white while armed.







,


This can occur when a situation is obviously turning south, or you are just in a bad part of town. Your awareness is heightened, and your observations become more specific: ""What is this guy doing walking right toward me?"" ""What is that in his hand?"" ""That group of hoodlums don't look like they are up to much good.""
While no need for action is immediately required, you are ready and prepared. If something were to happen you know exactly where to move at this moment and you are thinking about possibilities for tactical withdraw or retaliation.
This condition has a specific (and predetermined) point which will pull your ""mental trigger"", which means you will snap into action and execute your plan.
This point will vary from person to person as they weigh risk, moral, ethical, and other repercussions that will occur. Just remember the average ""shady person"" will be much more limited on kindness and forgiveness than you are.

,


At the beginning of the red condition your weapon should be out and ready. This will free up any required retaliatory options.
You execute your plan working your way from the primary threat to secondary threats, and so on; always be thinking of the here and now and not on what you have just done or will do after you have gotten away from the situation.
Remember, as you are making decisions, they will be very quick and the member of the battle who makes the correct decisions the quickest will be the most likely to walk away. As in condition orange difficult moral and ethical decisions that you will run into should have been determined (by yourself) before you ever started carrying your weapon on your person.
In this competition ""the only trophy is the right to breathe, and the loser gets sent home in a body bag.""

, This is when you are with the police or assessing a downplay of what just happened.


This is the combat debrief period. At this moment take steps to notify the proper authorities and analyze how the situation went.
Remember, after a combative situation, you may have to deal with both mental and physical aspects of recovery from a flight/fight response.
Cooperate with the Police, but make sure you do so through a lawyer or legal counsel. Sometimes you may need legal counsel to ensure your side of the story is accurate and is portrayed to the authorities in a manner in which you will minimize the Civil or Criminal liabilities for your actions.
No matter what, if you are at this condition, then you reached the desired condition. You have stopped the threat and, you are alive.

Be aware that there are multiple kinds of freshwater sources available in the outdoors.,

Prepare to collect if it looks like it is going to storm.,
Utilize snow.,
Look for water-filled, safe plants.,
Use a still.,
Find a large container such as a bucket, or dig a small, about hand-sized or two-hand sized hole in the ground.,
Place a clear plastic sheet over the containers, and place a slightly heavy object or a bit of dirt over the mouth of the smaller container but on top of the plastic.,
Let this sit in the sun for a few hours.,
Do some learning from others before heading out.",How to Get Water While Camping," The most obvious of these are rivers, creeks, or lakes. These can be located primarily in depressed areas such as valleys, and near vegetation.


Remember that plants need water to survive too. Where there are plants, there is water of some form. ;
, When taking water from one of these sources, try to find a flowing source. Stagnant water can house parasites, insect eggs, and animal waste that have been festering and can cause severe illness and, in some cases, death. While flowing water is preferred, it can still house some of these hazards.

, A clean, unused sock can be filled with layered materials to remove dirt and other solids from the water, along with charcoal to remove chemical contaminants. This can be done by boiling the water in a clean metal container.


Place the container on hot embers, or preferably hanging it over a fire so the flames are just ""licking"" the bottom of the container. Even if the water looks pure, it can house health hazards. Boiling water kills off harmful bacteria and other microscopic organisms that may be looking to cause you to have illness.
Alternatively, water purification tablets or filters can be used to remove pathogens.
In order to cleanse stagnant and sludgy water, chemical purifiers or a solar still should be used to remove solid pathogens.
Some water should not be considered fit for drinking under any circumstances. Examples of this water include swamp water or water that has deceased animals in or around it.

, This is a less conventional approach but may be helpful.

, Lay out clean containers and clean plastics or other materials to collect rainwater. It is important that these surfaces are clean. Pathogens can rest on items such as tarps, ponchos, or other plastics. Rainwater itself can be consumed without treatment, but it is still safe to boil it anyway. Many campers contract illnesses from drinking water off tarps that have seldom been cleaned.

, Snow can be an excellent source of fresh water, but if possible should not be consumed without boiling. Munching on snow can cool the body the same way eating ice cream makes you colder. This can cause problems when you are out in a cold environment for a period of time. Hypothermia can creep in very fast and it is important to protect yourself from it the best you can.

, There are several plants that can grant water or similar liquids to survive. Coconuts, vines, moss, and other plants can house water and other life-sustaining liquids that can be obtained to survive.


Never drink the fluid inside of a cactus. This can dehydrate you more and cause adverse effects.
Never drink the fluid or stored water from any unidentified plant, as this can lead to illness or death.

, If you only have access to salt water or have no fire, a solar still can be used to collect fresh water from these sources. A solar still uses the sun to evaporate and separate  fresh water out of solutions.

, Place a smaller container such as a cup or canteen in the middle of the container or hole and put the liquid around it in the larger container.

, It is important that this creates a  slight downward slant toward the mouth of the smaller container, but the plastic is not touching the mouth of the smaller container. This will cause the water evaporated to dribble down the plastic and drip into the smaller container.

, After this time, you should have a modest amount of fresh water. If you don't have access to salt water, you can substitute it with urine. Les Stroud used a solar still method by urinating into a hole, placing a plastic cup in the middle of it, laying plastic wrap over the hole, and placing a bit of dirt on top of the plastic over the cup.After a few hours, he had about half a small plastic cup of fresh water which he drank straight away. In a desert or similar climate, this can work in tight spots.

, Many forums exist online to get information about camping or survival. Alternatively, guides can often be hired or consulted for hands-on training. Do your research on these websites to get a better idea of how to survive and never push yourself too far. Always have a means of contacting help or getting back to civilization. Enjoy the outdoors, keep hydrated, and stay safe.

Shake out the sleeping bag.,
Fold it in half, lengthwise.,
Tightly roll the sleeping bag.,
Secure the sleeping bag with the straps.",How to Fold a Sleeping Bag," Pick up the sleeping bag and give it a good shake -- this will remove any crumbs, hidden flashlights or lost socks. Lay the sleeping bag out flat on a section of clean, dry ground.;
, Zip up the sleeping bag, all the way to the top, then fold it in half lengthwise. Make sure the edges and corners are perfectly aligned, otherwise you won't be able to roll the sleeping bag neatly.

, Starting at the open end of the sleeping bag (where your head goes), begin rolling the material tightly, keeping it very straight and pressing out any air as you go.


One good trick is to place a tent pole or straight stick across the top end of the sleeping bag and roll the bag around it, instead of around itself.
As you roll, use one knee to press down on the sleeping bag (in between the rolling motions). This will help to keep it nice and tight.
Continue rolling until you reach the opposite end of the sleeping bag.

, Once you get to the end of the roll, you need to secure it -- this should be relatively easy as most sleeping bags come with cords or elasticated straps attached to the bottom edge.


Keep one knee pressed tightly into the center of the sleeping bag while you pull the elasticated straps evenly over the rolled bag or tie the cords around it. If you're using the cords, you can use the same basic knot you use to tie your shoelaces.
If the sleeping bag has no straps or cords, simply tie a loose piece of string around both ends of the rolled bag.
Once the sleeping bag is secure, you can gently pull the tent pole or stick out of the middle (if used) and pop the perfectly rolled sleeping bag into its carrier bag.

Mount the hammock.",How to Hang a Hammock Indoors," Start by deciding what room you want to hang your hammock in. Once you have that in mind you need to think about how long your hammock is. You will need to find 2 opposing points on the walls with no obstructions. If the walls are close enough together you can use two parallel walls otherwise, use two perpendicular ones.

These are just references these spots will not be exactly where you mount your hammock.
Keep in mind that you want to pick two spots at least 4 feet high.;
, To do this you will need to use the stud finder. Sweep the stud finder slowly across the wall until it finds the edge of the stud. Mark the edge.


Your stud finder will beep or light up when it finds a stud.

, Coming from the other direction sweep across the wall until it finds the other edged of the stud. Mark this spot.









, If the two marks on the wall are not 1.5 inches apart you have not found a stud and you should move up the wall and try again.

, Measure 3/4 of an inch in from one of your marks and mark it with an X.


This is the center of your stud.
Repeat the marking process until you have found the center of both studs.

, Using the 1/16-inch drill bit, drill at least two inches straight into the spot you marked on the wall., Using the 1/4-inch drill bit, drill into the pilot hole you just made.


Repeat the drilling and expanding process for both studs you marked.

, Start by using your hand to screw a 5/16 threaded eyelet into the hole.

, Insert the screwdriver through the eye and use it as a lever. This should give you enough leverage to completely screw the eyelet into place.


Do this for both studs.

, The eyelets should now be securely in place and should support as much weight as your hammock typically would.

If you have a hammock with clips on each end, you may simply clip the ends of your hammock to the eyelets.

,, A sleeping bag is great, but if you don't have one, a couple of thick blankets will be fine. Always expect that it will be cold at night.

, You will not want to wear stinky old jeans you have just been crawling around in the mud in. It would also be inappropriate to sleep in your underwear in a group setting.

, Do you need mosquito repellent? Should you be on the lookout for ticks?

, Walk daily around your neighborhood. Swim at a community pool.

, This will allow you to write home often and easily.

,,,, They should check this in with the camp nurse on the first day.

, It would be a bad thing to be out in the mountains without any such items if you need them.

, Wearing makeup everyday is generally not considered practical (you may not get a chance to wash it off properly and then you will break out) You may feel you cannot live without your iPod, but if it gets lost or damaged, you'll wish you left it at home.

, Making friends at camp is actually easier than in a normal setting because almost everyone there is a fresh face. Very few people will know anyone else, so cliques are almost nonexistent. Almost everyone will be nervous and excited and eager to make friends. It's also a unique opportunity to be whoever you want to be. Even if you weren't a very cool kid at school, you can be the coolest kid at camp as long as you are nice and try to have a great time.

, Arrive early to set yourself up and you can help other campers set up as they arrive. This is a great way to introduce yourself and make friends. The entire time you are at camp, volunteer to help anytime you can. Approach every project with enthusiasm and you will have a blast!

With P&S, just grab the gun, place your index finger along the side of a gun, point at a target, and pull the trigger with your middle finger or left index finger.

,

,
P&S is fast, automatic, instinctive, and accurate.,
P&S works because the gun barrel is aligned with the index finger, which we can instinctively, automatically, and accurately point at things.,
And it works in good light or bad, while moving, and against moving targets, even aerials.,
But, it doesn't happen by magic.,
With P&S, you grab the gun and hold it in the natural, strong, and level shooting platform made up of your thumb, the web of your hand, and your index finger.,
The middle finger, which can be flexed and extended independently, is used to pull the trigger.,
The index finger, when extended along the side of the gun, helps to naturally ""lock up"" the wrist, strengthen the grip, and improve recoil control.

,
The thumb and index finger DO NOT have to be held aloof from the gun.

,
You can squeeze the bejeebers out of the gun if you wish, using the natural pincer made up of your index finger and opposing thumb.,
The P&S grip can be maintained even when the gun is jumping and bucking in your hand with rapid firing.

,
And when used in conjunction with a ""wrist lock"" grip, elbow smashes to the left or right can be made, as well as forward punches.,
P&S does not rely on the use of a specific stance, the sights, body indexing, positioning, controlled breathing, trigger manipulation, trigger squeezing, or placing the gun muzzle on an aim point.

,
It is cognitively simple (requires little active thinking decision making).,
P&S can be used with, and to enhance other shooting methods.

,
In the picture above, see the attachment on the side of the gun.,
You and Police Agencies are welcome to make and add the aiming aid to your/their personal/Agency weapon/s, and at your/their own risk and expense.

,
C A U T I O N:

,
P&S may not be able to be used with some guns because of their size or design.

,
One such example is the ubiquitous M1911.,
Also, the method should not be used if the index finger will rest over the ejection port, or if it will be hit by the slide, or be burned by hot gases escaping from the cylinder gap of a revolver.

,
Use common sense and safe gun handling practices.

",How to Point and Shoot or P&S,",,,,,,, But it is not precision shooting, so do not expect dime or quarter sized groups.

, As such, the barrel will be AIMED at any target pointed at.

, P&S is the simplest Point Shooting method, can be learned with little or no training, and maintained with minimal practice.

, It's like riding a bike or tying your shoes. Both are seemingly impossible tasks until done. But once done, they become almost automatic.

, Your ring and little fingers also help with the grip, and they add tenacity to it. That's their job.

, Its base adds to the grip.

,,, All the increased pressure will do, is strengthen your grip on the gun.

,, Recoil will be dampened considerably.

,, And it utilizes large muscle groups and gross motor skills which produce optimal performance during high levels of stress.

,, It was cut from a piece of plastic and attached with 3M Very High Bond double sided adhesive tape which forms a semi permanent to permanent bond. It keeps the index finger away from the slide and in place along the side of the gun, when firing rapidly.

,,,, The slide stop pin projects from the right side of the frame, so it may sit beneath the index finger when using P&S. If the pin is pressed while the gun is fired, the slide stop may shift and jam the slide.

Decide whether you'll choose an existing campsite alongside a river or you're wanting to make out your own campsite.,
If kayaking, canoeing or boating, get a map which shows you where it is safe to stop and camp.,
Never camp in a dry riverbed.,
Camp higher than the river.,
Find a suitable place to do your toileting and washing.,
Tell someone if you're wandering off, going fishing, sitting on a rock ledge over the river, etc.,
Watch out for dangers.,
Use your campsite as a base if you like.,
Set up activities to do.",How to Go River Camping," If the latter, be sure it is permitted to camp by the river.


Look online for campsites located along riversides. The campgrounds will most likely make the river aspect a feature of the advertising.
In National Parks, ask the rangers which campsites are located alongside the riverbanks.;
, This should also include places to keep the boat safe while you set up camp and sleep.

, It may be nice and flat and look inviting but after a storm begins or a dam breaches, that river can fill up faster than you can imagine. If you're all asleep, the water can roar down from its source unbeknownst to everyone, leaving no time for escape.


Know the weather in the region. How quickly do storms occur? If they're sudden and high impact, it is important to bear in mind that flash flooding may occur quickly and with dire results.

, Even if you're on the riverbanks, flooding is still a danger in some areas where high rainfall can cause the river to swell quickly.


Do not camp inside caves, coves or dugout areas in cliffs alongside a riverbank unless rangers or locals have confirmed one hundred percent that this area does not flood. If you see dampness on the ground or on ledges, this means that the water penetrates inside.

, Do not dump your washing water, kitchen scraps/leftovers or fecal matter into the river. It isn't a dumping ground and this can promote disease and/or attract vermin and predatory animals. Instead, find a location away from the river to dump used water, follow proper hygiene practices for using the toilet (or use toilet facilities provided) and take all garbage out with you.

, If something happens, someone should be aware of your whereabouts and your activity.

, Not all rivers are easy to cross or safe to be in. Know what the river contains and stay well away from possible problems.


Beware the local wildlife. Some rivers have inhabitants such as crocodiles, alligators, biting fish and other sources of potential harm. Find out well before you set up your campsite and wander near the river's edge.
Some rivers may be a source of disease or parasites, depending where you are in the world. Do your research before venturing in for a swim or a wade with bare feet.
Watch out for rapidly flowing water, deep water (often in the middle or where there is a lot of water), sudden drop-offs, etc. if you plan on swimming or using the river water.
Know how to cross a river safely.

, Unless you're traveling by boat and want to keep moving on, you could remain at the riverside camp for several days and head off on river-related adventures.

, There are lots of fun opportunities alongside the river, including:


Boating, canoeing or kayaking. If there are white water rapids nearby, there might be a company offering rides.
Fishing.
Water skiing.
Swimming.
Riding a bike or a horse along the river's edge.
Walking along the river's edge.
Photographing, painting or writing about the river. If you can, catch a sunset/sunrise or a moonrise over a river––absolutely magical.
Treating the riverside as a beach; lay out your towel, pull out the sunglasses and a good book and simply relax.

Have fun.","How to Enjoy Camp Chrysalis, Mendo Session"," Generally the camp packing list on Camp Chrysalis' website is good enough, but keep in mind that you absolutely cannot live without these items: at least one pair of wool socks (ideally, two); good walking shoes; tidepooling shoes; a sunhat; warm clothes for mornings and evenings; and, of course, a bathing suit. Remember, you'll be there for 10 days, and will be wearing things several times.;
, This is Mendocino, people. Expect bugs in the evening, constant fog, cold nights, and even searing-hot afternoons. The weather along the coast is iffy so you want to be prepared for anything. Put on lots of sunscreen even if it's overcast; the sun still shines through. Don't get bummed if it's wet or cold, you will have a wonderful time anyway.

, Sleeping arrangements: if you bring a tent that fits more than one person, expect to have a tentmate. it's great to sleep with a friend(s) from outside of camp or who you know from a previous session but you'll make more new friends if you're with a total stranger. Trust your instincts when looking for a tent mate you'll like. Talk to your group leader to change your sleeping arrangements; the general rule is no switching tents after campfire. If you want to sleep outside, go for it! If it's clear, the stars are beautiful, but put a tarp over yourself to protect you from morning dew and rain.

, You will be given enough quarters to take one short shower at the bathrooms down the road. It's a good idea to being extra quarters if you plan on washing your hair or taking two showers. Two quarters will get you three minutes of hot water. Many people shower after the second day of tide pooling, after the sand dunes, or after canoeing. Pick a time when other people aren't showering, such as the morning, so there will be hot water and no line. Also, bring enough underwear. It's important to change them frequently because the counselors will check if they are suspicious. Deodorant, soap, shampoo, conditioner, and wet wipes are also handy.

, There are certain things that happen at Chrysalis that you might not be used to if you live in a conservative community or go to typical camps. These may include the freedom you'll have around camp, the way counselors act, the frequent political discussions between campers, the occasional drunk staff member, or the casual co-ed atmosphere. Roll with it.

, The most important thing is to not trip! You will have an awesome time if you just let go and have fun. A lot of people are homesick since the session is 10 days. If you're homesick, talk to a friend, CIT, or counselor. Everyone at Chrysalis is totally cool and accepting. You will have the time of your life.

Sand down any sharp parts if using wood, or remove old screws, etc., that might be sticking out.







, This will avoid staining the ground or work surface.

, You can simply cover the entire stool in the same color, or you could get more creative. For example:


Write each stool owner’s name on the underside of each seat. Or, choose a different color paint for each stool, as a way of personalization.
Add ladybugs, frogs, bees or other cute designs that are simple to paint.
Ask children to paint on their own interesting design. This can allow them to express their artistic selves freely.

,, Depending on where you paint the stool, (heat or humidity add on to dry time), this could take up to 24 hours. Again, read the manufacturer's suggestions before assuming it's dry.

, If necessary, add a second coat of paint. The color should really pop, so add another coat of paint if it doesn’t have a vibrant appearance from the first coat.

,, If this is outdoors, use a spotlight or use lamps with extension cords (tape down any cords that cross walking areas, to avoid tripping). Then turn off the light and the stools should glow.


Follow the manufacturer's instructions for any deviation from this method.

, It is a shady site located near a bubbling rapid section of the river and sits in relative isolation from the other sites. It cannot hold an RV.
Other good shady sites on the Merced river include sites 502, 504, 526, 524, 522 and 520.
Sunny sites that are pleasant include sites on the river, such as site 113. Other sunny sites situated on the river but also located near the road, both in and out of the campground, are sites 101, 103 105, 107, 109 and 111.
One delightful spot is site 136. This is a shady, relatively isolated site within view of Tenaya Creek.

, They are the most crowded and do not provide riverfront access.

, Suitable sites include sites 18, 37, 28, 39, 60 and 63. These are great when the weather isn't too hot. Be aware, however, that on a very hot summer's day, the lack of tree cover can make these campsites rather uncomfortable.

, These are located in the back of the campground. As such, they have some relative isolation and avoid the sun. Suggested good sites include 87, 88, 89, 69, 70, 71, 53, 4 and 2.

, However, many of them may be crowded and unappealing if you are seeking more solitude and space.

Some camps even specialise for people physically or mentally disabled, or who require injections or infusions. Some camps like this are:

Hole in the Wall Gang Camp
Double H Ranch
Camp Boggy Creek

;
, There are a lot of camps that are specific to sports, theatre, arts etc. Be warned that you will doing these events all day long almost or every day of the week. Make sure you really can endure these activities for a long time or else you might not be happy. If you feel confident that you would enjoy doing these activities everyday try to find a camp that is specific to the activity.

, There are camps that are specific to certain religions. At these camps you may be required to attend special services and there may be special activities specific to the religion. If you do not feel comfortable integrated with other kids of another religion or if you simply enjoy carrying out the traditions of your religion a religious camp might be the right choice.

, There are certain camps that only allow girls or boys to attend. If the opposite gender puts a truly negative spin on your general lifestyle you might want to choose a gender specific camp. If you are neutral about the opposite gender you should probably choose a co-ed camp.

, Some overnight camps require you to pre-arrange phone calls with parents. Some even do not allow you to call your parents within a certain time if arrival. If you feel you would like to contact your parents on a regular basis you should call the camp and ask about their policy. You should probably also bring a calling card because most camps won't supply you with one. Some camps do sell calling cards though.

, Most camps offer a minimum of 2 week sessions but minimums can range 1-4 weeks (and possibly higher). Decide how long you want to stay and make sure the camp you choose accommodates that.

Understand your recreational goals.,
Create a checklist of your biggest priorities in a trailer, and then take the list with you when trailer shopping to decide on the type of trailer model, bathroom, kitchen and bedroom style you prefer.,
Consult your tow vehicle's owner's manual to learn how much weight your vehicle can safely tow.,
Consider how you will pay for the camping trailer.,
Narrow down your camping trailer options even further by talking to owners of the trailer you are interested in buying.,
Visit a RV show with multiple manufacturers.",How to Choose a Camping Trailer," Knowing how often you plan to use the trailer and where you like to camp will help determine the type of trailer that can meet your needs.


If you only want to camp during summer, a lightweight, less expensive trailer with tent-style pop-out walls may be more appropriate than a 4-season camper trailer with heavy insulation and a higher price tag.;
,


For example, if your family is large, a fifth wheel trailer may be ideal. Many of the largest fifth wheels have a separate bunkhouse and bathroom away from the master bath, which gives children an area to call their own.
A couple with no children may prefer a standard trailer, which has fewer layout plans but is more lightweight and costs less.
Campers who prefer staying in isolated, rugged conditions may find that a small, all-terrain pop-up camping trailer is the ideal choice for housing 1 or 2 people during short trips.

, Understanding this number will help you choose a trailer that does not exceed your vehicle's weight allowance when fully loaded with gear and water.


A fifth wheel trailer with a typical gooseneck hitch can only be pulled with a 3/4-ton or 1-ton pickup, while a small popup trailer with a standard ball-hitch can be pulled by mid-sized station wagons or even sedans.

, If you plan on financing a new model, remember that RVs (like all vehicles) lose a significant share of their value after the first year on the road. Good deals can often be found on used, depreciated RVs at the end of summer when owners decide they don't enjoy camping as much as they thought they would.

,


Visit online RV communities and camping trailer review websites to learn what seasoned campers do and don't like about their trailers.
Find out which manufacturers have the best warranties and repair service by asking trailer owners how they were treated when mechanical failures occurred.
Check for recalls on appliances contained within the trailers you are interested in buying. Trailer manufacturers typically do not make the appliances contained in their trailers (such as stoves, refrigerators and water heaters); trailer appliances are sourced from appliance companies who are responsible for contacting consumers in the event of a recall notice. Always ensure that the trailer you are buying doesn't have appliances that are under recall warnings.

, Seeing a variety of trailers on the showroom floor will give you a good idea of typical trailer floor plans and extras such as slide-out rooms, entertainment centers and types of bathrooms. RV shows also save time by allowing you to talk with a variety of manufacturers in 1 setting.

Decide which features matter most to you.,
Consider the affordability of the flashlight.",How to Choose a Camping Flashlight1," When camping, reliability and brightness are probably the key features that will ensure a good nighttime experience. If you plan on being in the wet a lot, water resistance or waterproofing will also be an important feature.;
, The amount of features and the strength of the flashlight can really increase the cost of the flashlight. For example, brighter flashlights usually cost more. Be aware of this before making your choice within your budget.

Wear the right clothes.,

Consider an umbrella--if it can be used safely.,
Wear minimal clothing.,
Take off any jewelry before going outside.,
Have the muddy puddles ready.,

Point out any hazards.,
Take close supervision while your child jumps in the mud.,
Join in.,
Play games while in the mud.,
Enjoy the time.,

Take off all your clothes outside, if practical.,
Towel off.,
Go straight in the bathtub.,
Wash off the muddy clothes.,
Clean up anything outside.",How to Jump in Muddy Puddles with Your Kids," Before jumping in and getting dirty, you and your children will need the proper clothes for their fun entertainment. Shovel on some snow pants beneath your jeans to protect you from the cold. Wear a thick coat or a raincoat that is zipped or buttoned tightly. If needed, wear a rain hat to protect your hair from getting wet or dirty.


Make sure you and your child have an outfit underneath their rain clothes. Choose washable ""play clothes"". A plain shirt and jeans will do.
Sometimes it may be too hot to wear the right rain gear. If it is a hot, summer day then have your child wear a regular summer outfit. They will get soaked, but just be prepared to change them afterwards.
If you do not have a rain hat, then use the hood on the back of your child's coat.;
, Rubber boots (also called rain boots, Wellington Boots and Gum Boots) are safe to run and splash in the mud in. They are easy to wipe clean of dirt, simply use a moist napkin or cloth or boots can be hosed off later. Not only that, but they are comfortable for kids to use and jump in. Water will be splashing in their toes so it is important to be prepared with dry socks later.

, Some children really enjoy umbrellas. Rain will be everywhere and having something protect you from the cold rain will help from getting mostly dirty. Even if it is not raining, the muddy water will hopefully land on the umbrella rather than the child.


An umbrella may not be needed if the puddles do not contain much water.
Children may use an umbrella by scooping water out of the puddle into an overturned umbrella. It is up to you whether this is acceptable play with the umbrella or not.

Young children tend to be unsafe and careless with umbrellas, especially in groups. If you have several children running about, or your child is not particularly careful with umbrellas, consider forgoing the umbrellas altogether.

, Another approach is to forgo all protective clothing. Perhaps even let them go play naked, if possible. There are several good reasons:

Laundry. If a child plays in mud, you will create extra laundry. So just accept this as a given. It is virtually impossible to keep a child perfectly clean dry under these play conditions. So wear just as much clothing as the child requires, and no more. Why give yourself more laundry than needed?

Raincoats, rain pants,snow pants and rain boots are not designed to keep out mud from mud puddle play. These items are designed to keep a child dry while walking out in the rain, not a child determined to play down in the mud.
In mud play, raincoats get filthy. Sometimes the mud comes off easily, other times it does not. And raincoats are typically not machine-washable. So the pretty ladybug patterned raincoat may end up permanently dull and soiled if taken out to the mud puddle.
If the weather is really too cold to have your child play in puddles, do not allow your children near the mud. Snowpants can help children keep warm, but snow and mud are quite different substances. A pair of snowpants soaked in mud will be cold and uncomfortable.
Playing in mud puddles teach valuable ""if-then"" lessons. Young children often have a hard time linking action and effect. A four year old may enthusiastically jump in a puddle and then be surprised that she gets wet. The lesson that links her action to the consequence (good or bad) is very educational.
You are only young once! At some point, it is not generally acceptable to play in a mud puddle naked. But it is if you are a toddler. Let kids be kids, and enjoy the simple (if messy) pleasures in life.

, Rings, necklaces, bracelets, earrings, and other types of jewelry should be taken off. Some types jewelry tends to get rusty from dirt, even if you wash it. Plus, you wouldn't want your expensive, gold ring to get all covered in mud.

, If it was raining the night before, the ground and soil should be muddy. If it hasn't, you can make your own mud. Spray your hose into the soil and have it soften.

, Children playing in mud may not realize hazards obvious to you. Point these out before letting loose. These include:

Road safety - no playing in the road, for instance.
Contaminated water, such as puddles with engine oil floating on it.
Very deep puddles. Children usually fall into these anyway, however!

, There are times when they might slip and/or get hurt.

, No one is ever too old to jump in a muddy puddle! Laugh and jump with your child, getting muddy and dirty. Try not to worry about the mess--you will clean everything up at the end.

, Try making up pretend games to play while jumping. You can ask your child for help since they like thinking up of new games. Some examples can be playing ""Ring a Ring o' Roses"" in the mud, playing Leap Frog in the mud, and so on., Yes, this is messy play but it makes children happy and healthy. Let alone the fear of the mess and just enjoy the time you get with your kids. Take photographs of the play.

, If possible, a quick hosing off can greatly simplify cleaning later.




, Mud can trickle in the house without removing your clothes off first. If you think that people can see, go in a private area like a garage, shed, or near a fence. Remove all dirty clothing off yourself and your kids and place it in a large, plastic bag, laundry basket, or other container.

, Even with clothes removed, there is likely mud that can be tracked in everywhere. A quick toweling off before proceeding forward can prevent a lot of mopping or vacuuming later. Remember hands, especially!

, Clean you and child up as they will be dirty, cold, and hopefully tired. If your child is old enough to take a bath, have them do so. Do not forget to shampoo your child well and and rinse with warm water.

, If possible, very muddy clothes should be rinsed before washing. Immediately place clothes in the laundry machine to launder later.

, If any toys, outdoor chairs, or other outdoor items got dirty it might be time to start washing them. Use your hose to give them a good cleaning. Have them dry in a safe, cool area.

Find two trees 10-12 feet apart.,
Wrap SlapStraps on each tree.,
Take extra precautions to protect trees.,
Attach your hammock to the straps.,
Test and adjust the hammock.",How to Hang an ENO Hammock1," Look for two trees that are about 10-12 feet apart to hang your hammock when you’re outdoors. The trees should be alive and healthy with solid bark and no overhead hazards.


Choose trees that are at least a foot (12 inches) in diameter to ensure stability.
Do not use trees for mounting your hammock if they are closer together than 10 feet, as your hammock may be too low to the ground when weight is applied.
Check with the administrators of the park or natural area you’re in before hanging up your hammock. Some have rules and regulations regarding hanging hammocks, as it can affect the health of trees.;
, Take out your set of two ENO SlapStraps and attach one to each of your mounting trees. The straps should wrap around a wide part of the trunk, about 5 feet from the ground.









To attach a SlapStrap, wrap it around the trunk of a tree and hold an end in each hand. Thread one end through the loop on the other end, then pull until the strap is tight around the tree trunk. Do this with both straps/trees.
You can use your own rope or strap system instead of ENO’s SlapStraps, but note that they may be more difficult to put up or less safe.

, Ensure you are using SlapStraps properly as discussed here to avoid any negative impact on the trees you use to hang the hammock. Try placing sticks in between the strap and the tree to lessen friction.


Gather a handful of sticks from the ground in your surrounding area. They should be roughly the length of your forearm and of the same diameter as one another. Note that you need their diameter to be thick enough to stick out from the bark of the tree slightly.
Hang your SlapStraps, then place the sticks between the strap and the tree, all the way around, about a hand’s width apart between each one., Attach your ENO hammock between the trees by using the provided carabiners on each end of the hammock. Slip the carabiner into one of the five loops provided.









Your ENO hammock comes with an aluminum wiregate carabiner at either end for attachment to straps. Push to open the gate to put it on one of the loops, then make sure the carabiner is fully closed around it.
The five adjustment loops available make it easy to adjust the height of the hammock. Just choose a higher or lower loop depending on how far you want your hammock to be from the ground (recommended 18 inches or lower when occupied)., Slowly put weight on your hammock once it has been attached to the straps on the trees. Sit and then lay down fully in the hammock to determine if it is at the right height.









If you touch the ground at all while in the hammock, it should be higher. Secure the carabiners to a higher loop on each SlapStrap. If you have no more available loops, you need to select trees that are farther apart.
If it’s difficult to get into your hammock to begin with, it should be lower. Attach the carabiners to a lower loop on the SlapStraps. If you have no more lower loops, choose trees that are closer together, or purchase Atlas or Atlas XL straps.
The ends of your hammock should be placed into loops so that they are level, or with a slight difference that’s comfortable to you while you’re lying down in it (for example, you may like to have your head slightly higher)."

Be aware of the legal and social concerns.,
Confine yourself to private areas.,
Wait until night time.,
Go naked outside at your leisure.,
Stick to your own property.,
Visit a nudist colony.,
Take a trip to a nude beach.",How to Go Outside Naked," Most people aren’t used to seeing themselves naked. In order to work up the courage to go uncovered outdoors, you first have to be confident in the way you look and feel. Take some time to get reacquainted with yourself in your most natural state, without judgment or self-consciousness.Learn to love and accept your body. Everyone is made differently, and there’s no reason to be ashamed of the way you look.Don’t rush yourself. It may take weeks, months or even years to get accustomed to going nude.;
, If you’re not used to going without clothes, it may feel strange at first. Take your time and build up to a level of nudity you’re comfortable with. You might walk to the bathroom naked to take your morning shower, or take a little longer before getting dressed after you’re finished.Learn to be more relaxed about nudity by gradually wearing fewer clothes. If you usually lounge around in sweatpants and a t-shirt, try switching to shorts and a tank top.
Once you get over the initial feeling of vulnerability, you may find nakedness to be very freeing., One natural way of going naked for longer periods of time is to get undressed before you go to bed. That way, you’ll still be covered up while you learn to let your body breathe. Some people actually prefer to sleep naked because there are no clothes to get tangled up in.If you share a room with someone else, make sure they’re okay with you going naked before exploring your new habit.
Sleeping naked is more than just a personal preference—it actually has health benefits, too., Perform routine tasks like making breakfast, reading the paper or answering your emails in the buff. Before long, you’ll begin to associate nudity with everyday activities and it will be less intimidating. And since you’ll be in the privacy of your own home, you can concentrate on relaxing and enjoying the feeling of freedom.This is only recommended for people who live alone, as it’s inappropriate to force others to see you without clothes.
Make sure the blinds are closed and the curtains are drawn so that others nearby don’t get an unwanted eyeful.

, Before you put yourself on display for the world to see, you should make an effort to learn a little bit about the laws in your area related to public nudity. Even if it’s not illegal to be naked out in the open where you live, it may be considered lewd by those around you. Knowing the risks will keep you from getting yourself into trouble or accidentally offending someone.It’s not a good idea to go nude outside in public areas, especially if there are families or children nearby.Should you decide to practice nudity outside, you should be ready to accept whatever consequences come your way.

, Don’t venture too far from your home right away. Instead, stick to spots that are out of sight from the neighbors, like a screened-in porch or behind a tall fence or hedge. This will allow you to remain hidden while you take your first steps beyond your living space.Enjoy a nude romp may be difficult if you live in an apartment or a crowded neighborhood that doesn’t allow much privacy.

, Going out when it’s dark will give you a chance to move further out into the open without fear of being seen. And, even if you are spotted, it won’t be as obvious what you’re doing. For most people, this will be a great way to take the plunge and go fully naked outside of their home for the first time.


To avoid any awkward situations, it will be safest to go out during the early morning hours when everyone else is asleep.
Stay away from streetlights, floodlights, passing cars or anything else that may make you plainly visible.

, Once you’re totally at ease, you can start soaking in the great outdoors in all your natural glory. Embracing nudity is all about innocence and freedom from shame. You’ll feel much more in touch with the world around you when you let go of social norms and return to the way man was meant to be.


Take care of your gardening or practice yoga without the burden of hot, restrictive clothing.
Remember to keep yourself concealed from neighbors and passersby as much as possible. If you get reported, you’ll have a tough time explaining yourself., You generally have a right to do whatever you please in the place you call home, as long as you’re not hurting anyone else. That means there’s no better place to shed your clothes than your own backyard. If you have enough well-screened space, you might even be able to do some sunbathing or go for a pleasant stroll.A wooded grove or field set far back from the road can make a perfect place to strut your stuff.
In most countries, it’s almost always against the law to be in public places, like the park or the local convenience store, without clothing.

, There, you’ll be free to roam around at will without fear of judgment or legal repercussions. You’ll also have a chance to speak with other nudists and gain some insight into their way of life. They may even be able to offer you useful pointers on how to go naked in more places and situations.Many towns have resorts that are specifically designated for practicing nudists. Run a quick internet search to see if there’s one of these sites near you.Always be respectful of others who have chosen to live as nudists. It takes a lot of courage to be naked in front of others, and there’s no room for harassment or ridicule., Plan your next vacation for somewhere like the South of France or Australia’s Samurai Beach, where nudity is not only permitted but encouraged. You’ll save room in your suitcase by not having to pack a swimsuit, and by the time you leave you’ll have the most even tan of your life. Just don’t forget to bring sunscreen!Nude beaches can be found on almost every major continent, and may be worth the trip if you have a desire to bear it all somewhere more interesting than your backyard.Be certain that your destination allows public nudity before you strip down.

Find two solid trees for mounting.,
Wrap Atlas straps around the trees.,
Use sticks for extra tree protection.,
Secure the hammock to the straps and adjust.,
Use Helios straps for more lightweight flexibility.",How to Hang an ENO Hammock2," Hang your hammock between two trees approximately 10-12 feet apart. The trees should be alive with sturdy trunks of at least 12 inches diameter and no overhead hazards.


The Atlas and Atlas XL can be used to hang hammocks between trees that are farther apart due to the extra adjustment loops. However, a distance of 10-12 feet between the trees is generally ideal. Don’t use trees closer than 10 feet apart.
Check with the administrators of the park or natural area you wish you hang your hammock in first. They may have rules or regulations about hammocks to protect the safety of trees.

, Use the two straps that come with ENO’s Atlas system to secure the hammock to the trees. Wrap a strap around each tree about 5 feet from the ground.









To secure an Atlas strap, pull the multi-adjustment end (with small loops at intervals along the strap) through the end that has the label and a single larger loop. Pull it until the strap is tight around the tree trunk.You are welcome to use other straps or ropes to hang an ENO hammock in this way, but it may not be as easy, safe, or adjustable.

, Ensure you are installing the Atlas straps properly as discussed here to avoid any damage to the trees you’re using to hang your hammock. Place sticks in between the strap and the tree to lessen friction as an extra precaution.


Gather a handful of sticks from the ground in your surrounding area. They should each be about the same diameter, and about the length of your forearm. Note that you need the diameter to be thick enough that the sticks will protrude out from the bark of the tree slightly.
Hang your Atlas straps normally, then place the sticks between the strap and the tree, all the way around the trunk, about a hand’s width apart between each one., Attach your hammock to the available loops on each Atlas strap with the carabiners at either end. Adjust the hammock to your desired height by changing which loops the carabiners fit into.









Atlas straps have a combined total of 30 adjustment loops, while the Atlas XL has an additional 10 loops and 54 inches of length for maximum adjustment options.
Your ENO hammock comes with two aluminum wiregate carabiners at the ends. Visually check that they are closed, and listen for a “click” before you put weight on your hammock.Slowly sit and lay on your hammock to test the height and evenness. Move each carabiner to a higher loop if your hammock is too low to the ground, a lower loop if your hammock is too high, or one or the other carabiner to a different loop if the two sides are uneven.

, Try out the ENO Helios straps if you need an extra lightweight design for backpacking, or you have a tricky space for hanging. Helios uses a bury splice design for extra adjustability.


Secure the straps to each tree like you would with SlapStraps or Atlas, except with Helios you will pull the thin end made with strong Dyneema cord through the end with a thicker polyester strap.
Slip each hammock carabiner through the small loop end of the cord that’s labeled “Place hammock here.” Then pull the long end of the cord to adjust the hammock higher, or pull on the cord between your hammock and the tree to adjust it lower.Note that the Helios straps are designed to hold 300 pounds, rather than the 400 pound maximum that other ENO straps are designed for."

Find two sturdy indoor or outdoor structures for the hanging kit.,
Find studs for the hanging kit anchors.,
Mark and drill into the wall.,
Attach the lag screws, anchors, and steel carabiners.,
Opt for a hammock stand.",How to Hang an ENO Hammock3," Hang a hammock more permanently indoors or outdoors in an area with a lack of suitable trees. Use a hanging kit to mount the hammock between any two structures that contain wooden studs or other sturdy wood material.


Find a space with a distance of about 112 inches between your two structures, where you can attach the anchors for the hammock about 50 inches off the ground. Lay your hammock down on the floor between the structures for reference, or hold it up in the space to make sure.
Note that the hanging kit from ENO is designed for use with strong wooden structures, like the wooden studs in a home wall. If you wish to hang your hammock from other structures, you should choose different screws and fittings designed for that material.Never install the hanging kit into trees, as it can severely damage them.

, If you’re hanging your hammock from two walls, you need to locate wooden studs for the hardware. Use a hammer and nail to help you find studs, or an electronic stud finder if you have one.


With a hammer, tap gently along the wall and place your hand just above where you’re tapping to feel the vibration of the impact. When you tap where there is a stud, the vibration will be much less and the sound will be a dull thud.
You can also use features in a room to determine where studs are. Either edge of a window or door frame will always be on studs, and you can measure 16” (typically) away from the center of any known stud to find the next one.
To test any location you believe to have a stud, hammer a thin nail into the wall. If it meets resistance about ½ inch into it, there is a stud there. If it meets no resistance, there is just hollow sheetrock, which will NOT be suitable for holding up your hammock., Use a pencil to mark where you want your hammock to hang from each wall (about 50 inches from the floor is recommended). Then drill a hole in the center of each stud with a 5/16” drill bit.


Make sure you will be drilling into the center of a stud by making several more test holes close together on the wall. When you find the edge of the stud, measure ¾ inch in to mark the center, as a standard stud is 1 ½” wide.
Using a drill with 5/16” drill bit, drill straight into the stud for 3 inches., Use a 9/16” wrench or a socket driver to tighten the included hardware into the wall. You will tighten down an anchor with a lag screw into each of your drilled holes.


Tighten the lag screw until the anchor is snug against the wall, slightly compressing the sheetrock without damaging it.
Replace the aluminum carabiners that come with your ENO hammock with the heavy-duty steel carabiners provided with the hanging kit. Then attach the carabiners directly to the anchors to hang your hammock., Use a hammock stand for your hammock if you want a very simple process for hanging. Opt for a stand if you don’t have options for installing the hanging kit or using straps on trees, such as in an open indoor or outdoor area.


Purchase a hammock stand from ENO for easiest setup. Choose from a standard solo hammock stand, one that can hold three different hammocks, or a Roadie stand that can be held up by the wheels of a car for road trips.You can use other hammock stands for ENO hammocks if you wish, as long as the frame is about 10 feet long."

Know which heaters will not be suitable.,
Choose fans that can operate from the outside, directing the heat inward.,
Consider hiring several smaller heaters rather than one large one.,
Try to keep the heating to the minimum amount needed according to the season.,
Test the heating before the event.,
Consider the size and location of the event.",How to Heat Your Marquees at Outdoor Events," Heating the outdoors requires a lot of power and the heater must have a powerful fan to be able to spread the warmth evenly and consistently across a wide area. The marquee has no insulation at all, so providing an even temperature across the marquee is dependent on the fans constantly working at a high rate. As such, the types of heaters that are not suitable include halogen heaters, patio heaters, cabinet heaters and table heaters, because none of these have internal fans.


Do not use anything that runs cords across where people will be sitting, standing and walking in the marquee. That's a tripping hazard waiting to happen.;
, The best type of heaters for marquees are indirect heaters that are placed outside the marquee, and are powered either by gas or diesel, with ducting that sends the warm air inside.

Do not try to buy these heaters––this type of heater can be prohibitively expensive to buy. Instead, find a company that specializes in these heaters and hire them. The benefit of doing this is that you'll have the company's experts set it up and take care of it, and you won't have to worry about the heating during the event.







, This will be helpful for evenly distributing the air at all sides of the marquee but you will need to pay particular attention to where you position these heaters:


The heaters will need to be relatively close to the main seating or gathering areas.
The heaters must be pointed towards any entrances where heat will be lost.


Both of these positions will help to maintain a more even temperature throughout the marquee.

, That will save on costs and avoid overheating or over-drying the air in the marquee. Obviously, for the deep cold of winter, you won't be turning the heaters off but you may find it optimal in other seasons to vary the usage of the heaters. Consider the following as good ways to provide heating in the marquee as per the season:


In cold seasons: You will need heaters on throughout the event, and perhaps for a period before guests arrive, to warm the marquee sufficiently.







In the late spring, summer and early autumn: You may be able to heat the marquee at the beginning of the event, turn it off for a while, and then if the event runs into the evening, you can switch it back on again later in the day when the temperatures drop.

, Test it at a similar time of day to when the function is taking place, so that you can work out how long the space takes to heat up to a comfortable temperature. Or, ask for the recommendation of the hire company as to how long the heating is required to warm the marquee sufficiently., If you are heating an outdoor space, again an indirect heater may be a suitable solution. If, however, you are only hosting a small summer event, such as a patio barbecue, you may find that several small outdoor gas patio heaters offer enough heating for seated guests, which will cost you less and provide sufficient comfort for the guests."

You could sleep by the shores of a Great Lakeor near caves ready for you to explore.;
, Many national parks offer campsites ranging from remote to full service. Remote, or backcountry, camping sites include few to no amenities like running water, electricity hookups, restrooms, or picnic tables.Full service campgrounds typically offer flush toilets, parking spaces, grills, and picnic tables.Extra services and amenities may enhance your camping experience, and you can often find these at privately owned camp sites. From delivery of fresh-caught lobster to your tentto heated indoor and outdoor pools,private camp sites can cater to your every need.

, Your tent will be your temporary home away from home, and if you choose well, you will enhance your camping experience.


Consider choosing a tent with a larger capacity than you will actually need. This will give your more space and can be helpful if you don’t like closed spaces or if you move around a lot while sleeping.Look at the weather forecast before you get a tent. If you are a new camper, a three-season tent, designed to be lightweight and good for camping in moderate conditions in the spring, summer, and fall, will probably suffice. If you will face harsher conditions, however, a four-season tent may be the right choice for you.Bring a tarp to place under your tent to protect it from damp, soggy ground.
Another useful item is a mat for your tent entrance to help keep down the amount of dirt tracked in to your outdoor home.
Regardless of the type of tent you choose, you should be sure to bring along extra stakes for the tent, in case you have a problem with one.

, You will definitely enjoy your camping experience more if you have everything you need to make your stay comfortable.


Bring camp chairs, folding tables, and hammocks so you’re not stuck sitting on the ground.
Extra blankets are good for wrapping up while around the campfire.
Most camping problems are easily solved if you bring along tools and hardware like a hammer or axe, rope, matches, pocket knives, lanterns, and flashlights.Other items that will help ensure your comfort and pleasure while camping include fire wood, toilet paper, paper towels, hand sanitizer, extra batteries, shower shoes and towels for bathing, and rain gear/umbrella.

, Your camping experience will be enhanced if you remember a few simple items for sleeping well under the stars:


Bring an air mattress, cot, or foam pad for under your sleeping bag. If you bring an air mattress, remember to bring your air pump as well.
Remember your pillow. There are pillows specifically designed for camping, but many prefer to just bring their comfortable one from home.Eyeshades and earplugs are also useful to help block out unfamiliar sounds or lights while sleeping in your tent.

, Who says camping cuisine needs to be limited to beef jerky, hot dogs, and dehydrated soups? If you pack foods and drinks you enjoy, you’ll ensure that at least your palate is happy.


Yogurt and granola are easy breakfast foods to bring, and bagels and muffins work well too.
Bean salads, pasta salads, fruit salads, and gourmet sandwiches are easily packable and could make for a tasty lunch or light dinner.
For dinner, you could bring items to cook over the campfire, like macaroni and cheese or Dutch oven lasagna. A quick Internet search will give you dozens of ideas.
Bring lots of ice in a cooler to keep your food from spoiling.
To keep food safe from foraging animals, odor-proof plastic bags or bear canisters are useful., Whether you’re camping in the heat of summer or facing rain or wind, having the proper clothes will make you more comfortable and ready to enjoy your outing.


Proper footwear, like hiking boots or trail shoes, will keep you comfortable and safe on trails near your campsite. Be sure to pack a few extra pairs of wool socks, too. They’ll help prevent blisters, and extra socks will be welcome if you face wet conditions.It’s good to think about layering when packing for camping. That way, you can remove or add layers depending on the conditions. If you’re comfortable, you are more likely to enjoy your campout.
A hat and sunscreen will help keep the sun off of your face, and rain gear will keep you dry in inclement weather.

, Having this essential item will increase your pleasure by helping you avoid itchy bites. Chemical bug repellents, like those containing DEET, are effective at deterring both mosquitos and ticks.You could spray the outside of your tent with bug spray to deter mosquitos and other pests from bothering you while sleeping.Citronella candles are another helpful item for keeping pests at bay.Although DEET has been declared safe by the Environmental Protection Agency, some still prefer “natural” bug repellents. Those containing oil of lemon eucalyptus have been found to be effective against mosquitos and ticks., Dermatologists recommend using a broad-spectrum sunscreen (which protects against both UVA and UVB rays) of at least SPF 30. Be sure the sunscreen is water resistant, since you may be sweating or swimming while camping.While outside, reapply your sunscreen every two hours, and don’t forget areas like your lips, ears, and back of your hands.

Pick a great spot for your tent.,
Go camping with friends.,
Add in fun activities.,
Have some old-fashioned fun.",How to Enjoy Camping2," Once you’ve arrived at your camp site, figuring out where to set up is your first challenge. Choose a generally flat area with good drainage. This will enable you to easily set up your tent and will help you sleep better knowing your tent won’t be flooded in the middle of the night.If you are backcountry camping, rangers can offer useful advice on good areas to consider for setting up camp.Look out for insect nests and slanted ground when setting up your tent. You will want to avoid both.
Avoid setting up below or near a dead or dying tree, since limbs can break off during heavy winds.Think about whether you want to be near restroom and shower facilities, for convenience, or away from them for privacy.

, If you are among people you enjoy spending time with, you will increase the odds of having a great time on your camping trip.


You may want to just bring a few friends to your first camping trip, since it will be easier to plan for a smaller number.
Another benefit of bringing friends along is that you can split up the gear and food that you’re bringing, so you each have to pack less. Just knowing that you have some help in the planning and preparation may help you have a better time while on your campout.

, Camping involves more than just sleeping in a tent. If you can think of ways to do things you enjoy on your campout, you will maximize your enjoyment.


If you are a foodie and love to cook, think of all of the ways you can bring that enthusiasm to cooking over an open fire. The Internet is full of gourmet campfire recipes you can use to impress your friends. For example, you could make grilled chicken or a fire-roasted vegetable salad.If you are a physical activity enthusiast, you have many options to increase your camping enjoyment. Hiking, biking, swimming, and boating are just a few of the activities you can partake in while on your camping trip.
Nature lovers can have a great time while camping by incorporating bird watching or stargazing into their trip.
If you need a break from the great outdoors, choose a campsite close to local attractions like historical sites or museums. That way, you get to do something you enjoy, while your camping partner gets to have fun too.

, At its core, camping is about the simple pleasure of slowing down and enjoying nature. You may be surprised how much fun you can have just relaxing and interacting with others.


Tell ghost stories around the campfire while eating s’mores.
Bring a guitar or other portable instrument and have a sing-along.
Play hide-and-seek in the dark.
Play card games.
Catch fireflies.

"

Stay in a cabin.,
Go glamping.,
Look into lodges.",How to Enjoy Camping3," From primitive to deluxe, cabins can offer you a way to slowly ease into the camping lifestyle. That way, you’ll get some basic comforts that you enjoy, and your fellow camper can experience the fun of the great outdoors.


Tell your camping partner that you’re not ready yet for tent camping, but you are willing to start with cabin camping.
Explain that you get the benefit of being with nature without the hassle of bringing along all of your equipment.
Show your fellow camper the amenities offered at the cabin you’ve chosen. They can range from fireplaces to hot tubs., High-end camping, or “glamping,” is becoming more popular, and it may be a way for you to really enjoy your camping experience.


Options at glamping resorts range from staying in treehouses, to yurts, to multi-bedroom permanent “tents.”Butlers, spa services, and fine dining are also common at glamping destinations.

, Even though staying at a lodge is not technically camping, maybe you can convince your camping partner that it’s as close as you’re willing to get to camping for the moment.


Many state and national parks offer lodges that can be rustic or deluxe.
With amenities like swimming pools and game rooms, you’ll be able to enjoy some indoor activities while also being close to nature.

Bring a first aid kit.,
Locate nearby hospitals or urgent care facilities.,
Leave contact information.,
Find nearby hotels or motels in case of terrible weather.,
Learn about poisonous plants/insects in the area.",How to Enjoy Camping4," Knowing that you have some medical necessities in case of a cut or fall will make you feel more secure and ready to enjoy your campout:Items to pack in your first aid kit include adhesive bandages, gauze pads, nonstick sterile pads, and medical tape. You should also include antiseptic wipes, antibacterial ointment, blister treatment, tweezers, and safety pins.
Medications to include are ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain relief, an antihistamine for allergic reactions, aloe vera gel for sunburn, poison ivy/poison oak treatment, and insect sting treatment.
In case of a sprain or strain, elastic wraps and finger splints are also useful to include.

, In case you have a more extreme accident, it is a good idea to know ahead of time the location of nearby medical facilities.


Just knowing the information could help you relax and have a good time while camping.
Make sure you also bring your insurance card or coverage information in case you need to go to the hospital.

, Give a friend or neighbor your contact information. You can leave your cell number, along with a number of the camp site that you have selected. You will be at ease knowing that your whereabouts are known in case you get lost while hiking or have car trouble.


Additionally, you won’t miss out on urgent news from home if you are easily able to be located and contacted.

, Even the most experienced campers sometimes face insurmountable storms or blizzards. If you plan ahead and have the locations of local options, you will be comfortable embarking on your camping trip.


Many national and state parks offer cabins and lodges, which could be an option if you face bad weather.
Often, camping sites are in recreational areas that have at least one motel or hotel nearby.

, One concern of new campers is how to avoid poison ivy or spider bites. If this describes you, having the knowledge of what plants and insects to avoid could add to your enjoyment of your trip.


Poison ivy is native to every U.S. state, except Alaska and Hawaii. It is characterized by its three pointed leaves that change color with the seasons. It can grow as a vine or as a bush.Poison oak also has three leaves, but these leaves resemble oak tree leaves. It can grow as either a low shrub, such as in the eastern part of the country, or as a climbing vine on the West Coast.
Poison sumac tends to grow in wet areas. It has smooth, not saw-toothed, leaves and red stems.The black widow, characterized by red marks on the underside of its abdomen, is a poisonous spider found throughout the United States.Another spider to watch out for is the brown recluse, which is brown with a dark violin-shaped mark on its head. It also has six, instead of the usual eight, eyes. Brown recluse spiders are most commonly found in southern and Midwestern states.

Being a freestyler requires a lot of hard work and extremely a lot of patience, so make sure that is met.,Yoga is Really Helpful and Stretching your Legs and Shoulders Make you Flexible and Make it easier for you

,
The Key is Practicing DO all The Tricks for a Month and After That You WILL Be Good at it in a month.

,
Get a soccer ball( not pumped too hard ) and start practicing juggling.,
After you master juggling you should start with basic freestyle tricks like stalling the ball which is holding the ball on your foot (pull the ball back as if your are about to start juggling, but instead balance it on your foot.,
Another basic trick is Around the World (ATW) when you flick the ball up go around it, and start juggling after you are done.,
Another basic trick that will get you the oohs and aahs is the neck stall.,
After you have perfected these 3 tricks, step your game up and link them all together.",How to Do Freestyle Football Tricks,";
,,, The key to that is to try to keep the ball below your hip and put a backward spin on it. Juggling helps your ball control and the speed of your legs. Practice juggling for 1 hour every day for about a month, most likely you are going to be an expert in juggling and you are able to do 100 keep-ups no sweat (if you practice).

, This move is a basic freestyle trick that leads up to other tricks. Once you master this trick you can work up to harder better tricks.

, This is not as easy as it sounds. For this trick you need a lot of speed and again a lot of patience. You should begin with the motion of it, and try doing it as fast as possible. When you think you are ready, out a ball in the play. Again practice for an hour a day for about 2 months and you can master this. But this trick is a lot harder than juggling so you need more patience. (*You can do this trick from juggling or from a stall, in both cases you should start going around the ball right after you flick it up, for juggling ATW, you should hit the ball from the right side of your foot for right legged people, and from the left side of your foot for left legged people.)

, Similar to foot stall you balance it on your neck. You can do this trick from a foot stall, you flick it up this time about half a meter higher than your head. Then you cushion the ball on your neck keeping you back straight on a 90 degree angle and keep your arm pointing back keeping your elbows straight. The key move in this trick is to cushion the ball on your neck, meaning you take the power of the ball away by going down at the same time as the ball only a bit slower than it so the power can be absorbed to your back/neck. Practice this trick for about half an hour every day for 2 weeks and you can perfect it. This trick is much easier than ATW.

, For example you can begin by juggling then going to a foot stall, then do ATW, followed by another foot stall and then a neck stall. If you are able to do all these three moves and keep the ball off the ground, you are going to be given respect.

Understand the motion of the sun in the sky.,
Know the season.,
Find east using the sun.,
Find west.,
Locate north and south.,
Navigate to your destination.",How to Determine Direction Using the Sun1," Due to the position of the earth and its motion through space, the sun generally moves through the sky from the east to the west. This is not a precise way of figuring out direction; depending on the time of year, the exact path of the sun changes between the northeast-northwest, east-west, and southeast-southwest horizons of the sky.A significant exception to this general rule can be found at the north and south poles. The extreme position of each pole on planet earth creates long seasons of darkness and light, with the sun being absent in some places for up to six months!;
, Our planet not only travels through space, spinning on its axis from west to east, but it also tilts toward and away from the sun.This tilt creates a difference in temperature that results in seasonal changes. The tilt of the earth will also influence the general position of the sun, so by knowing the season, you'll have a more accurate idea of the direction indicated by the movement of the sun in the sky.



In summer the sun rises over the northeast horizon. As the day passes, the sun will move through the northeastern sky into the northwestern half, finally setting behind the northwestern horizon.

In spring and fall the sun will travel a more direct route through the sky. This means that it will rise in the east and pass through the sky to set in the west.

In winter the sun will rise in the southeast part of the sky. Throughout the day, it will travel through the southeastern sky until it sets behind the southwestern horizon.NOTE: In the southern hemisphere (the southern parts of Africa, much of South America, Australia), the motion of shadows is reversed. This means that in summer the sun will rise in the southeast and in winter in the northeast, while spring and fall will be the same as the northern hemisphere with the sun rising in the east., Now that you're equipped with knowledge about the sun's path through the sky, you should be able to determine the approximate direction of east. For example, in spring east will be roughly where the sun has risen. Face this direction.


To find true-east more accurately in summer and winter, you'll have to adjust your direction slightly. In the summer you should adjust a little to the right, and in winter a little to the left.
The closer you are to the middle of the season, the more the sun will be oriented to the north in the summer or south in the winter. This means in the middle of summer and winter you'll have to adjust more to the right and left, respectively.

, The cardinal directions, north, south, east, and west, are equally distributed into quadrants on a compass. This means that east and west are directly opposite of each other, as are north and south. Since you're facing east, you now know the direction straight behind you is west.You may find it easy to hold these direction in your mind using landmarks or a mental picture. However, if you struggle visualizing these directions, you may want to draw a line on the ground straight in front of you. The far end will point east and the near end will point west.

, You should still be facing east at this time. When facing east, north will be 90 degrees to your left. Turn 90 degrees left to reorient yourself to face north. To do this, you should form a perfect L-shape with the direction of east. In your new position: east should be to your right; west to your left; north straight ahead; south directly behind.Again, you may find it easy to keep track of these directions using landmarks or a mental picture, but if you have difficulty visualizing these directions, draw a line on the ground straight in front of you. The far end will point north, the near end south.
If you have drawn lines to represent the directions of east-west and north-south, these should have created a plus sign (+). Each of the four points of the plus sign represent one of the cardinal directions - north, south, east, and west., Now that you know the approximate directions around you, you should be able to use major landmarks in the distance to get where you're going. Some major landmarks you might use include skyscrapers, mountains, rivers, large bodies of water, and so on."

Make a sun rod.,
Mark the shadow cast at first light.,
Draw your east-west line.,
Orient yourself to the north.",How to Determine Direction Using the Sun2," A stick, pole, or branch can be used as your sun rod. Find one that is as straight as possible and 1 meter (3¼ feet) long. Then take it to a level place that receives good sunlight. Drive your rod into the earth so that it forms a 90 degree angle (L-shape) with the ground.If you lack measuring tools, you may have difficulty getting your rod the right length. Generally you can assume that, if you are an adult of normal height, the distance between your fingertips when your arms are outstretched is about 1.5 meters (5 feet).Use this approximation to trim your sun rod as close to 1 meter (3¼ feet) as you can.

, To get an accurate read on your direction using shadows, you'll need to first wait for sun to set. When the sun rises in the morning, mark the spot your sun rod casts its first shadow. This shadow will point directly west, no matter where you are on earth., Wait 15 minutes and mark the new position of the shadow of your sun rod. It should have moved a few centimeters at this point. Mark this new shadow on the ground and then draw a straight line between your two marks.


This line will point approximately west in the direction of your first mark, and approximately east in the direction of your second mark., Stand on the line you have drawn, with your first mark on your left and the second mark on your right. You should form a 90 degree angle (an L-shape) with the line connecting these two points. In this position, you will be facing approximately north.


Following the line you have drawn to your will be west. Following the line you have drawn to the right is the east. Directly behind you, opposite north, will be the south."

Find your digging area.,
Dig into the dirt.,
Look under objects.,
Collect the worms.,
Preserve the worms for later.,
Store the worms.",How to Catch Worms1," Worms prefer living in black, moist, nutrient-rich soil with a covering of mulch or leaves. Small garden spaces, bases of trees, and areas that have decomposing leaves, are all typical sites that worms can be found. The optimal time to catch worms is right after a rainfall.It may be helpful to catch worms at dusk or nighttime. Night crawlers particularly like to surface at night.;
, Softly thrust a shovel into the moist dirt. Push the shovel down until the majority of the blade is in the dirt. You can use your foot to help push the shovel down further. Use leverage to lift the pile of dirt out of the ground, and look for worms in the newly made hole.


If you don’t immediately see worms wriggling around in the hole, you may have to keep digging a bit. You can also rake the mulch and leaves away from the soil and rake into the soil itself to stir it up and expose the worms. However, keep in mind that you will have to work quickly because they will head deeper underground when once the soil is disturbed.

, While searching for worms, turn big rocks, pieces of wood, bricks – along with any other relatively big and heavy object making contact with the soil – over, to search for worms underneath.You might find more success doing this when it is darker out. Once the object is flipped over, the worms will most likely try to burrow back into the soil when being shone with a light source., Use your fingers to pick up any worms you see. Try to pick the worms up by their end side, which will be lighter in color. This is because the end of their body is the last part of the worm to come out from the ground, and the first part to retract back in.You want to prevent the worms from getting the chance to retract back into the dirt.


If you grab a worm while it’s trying to go back into the dirt, do not yank it out of the ground. This can most definitely break the worm in half. Instead, hold steady pressure, keeping their body taut (don’t pull), and the worm will eventually relax and release their hold from the dirt.After grabbing a worm or two, dip your fingers into the apron full of sawdust. This will help dry your fingers from the slime covering the worms, and increase your grip when picking up the worms.Depending on what you’re using the worms for, a dozen or two dozen worms should suffice. You don’t want to remove a large number of worms from any given area, because it could have serious negative repercussions for that natural environment.

, As you pluck the worms from the ground, drop them into the plastic container with some dirt, a bit of decomposed leaves, or worm bedding.This will keep the worms alive while giving them an environment to nest in, until you use them later.

, The collected worms should be stored in a cool (less than room temperature), dark location. Be sure to put a cover on your plastic container.Worms are capable of crawling out of containers without lids. The lid must have puncture holes (about 5-6 holes a little bigger than the size of a pen tip), so the worms have the opportunity to breathe.


If you don’t put holes in the container lid, you’ll have a container full of dead worms.
Consider storing your collected worms in the refrigerator.A refrigerator qualifies as a cool, dark storage location, but just be conscious of the temperature of the refrigerator. You don’t want to accidentally freeze your worms.

"
"
Mix your soapy solution.,
Collect the worms.,
Rinse the worms off.,
Store the worms.",How to Catch Worms2," Squeeze approximately 10 tsp (40 ml) of dish soap into a watering can.Then, use a hose to add water to the soap in the watering can. Once the watering can is mostly filled with water, turn off the hose, and gently shake the watering can for about 10 seconds.


Rake the mulch and leaves off of the soil, and then pour the soapy solution over the area you plan to collect worms from. Make sure that you spread out the soapy water, and don’t pour it all in one spot.
Remember, moist, fertile soil is the ideal environment to find worms.
Shaking the watering can will mix the soap and water together, and you may have suds falling out of the watering can’s sprinkler., Once the soapy solution is poured over the dirt or grassy area, worms should start to wiggle to the surface.It may take a few minutes for most of the worms to surface, but as they do, use your fingers to pick them up and put them in a container until you can rinse them off later.


Again, try to pick the worms up by the end of their body, which will be lighter in color.

, Once you have your collection of worms, use clean, non-chlorinated water to gently rinse the worms from any soap residue.Add a little bit of water to the container holding the worms (completely covering the worms), and softly swish the water around for a few seconds. Then tilt the container with your hand on the edge, to drain out the water and catch any worms that might fall out.


You can also place a towel or old t-shirt over a bucket, place the worms on it, and then pour cool water over the worms to rinse away the soap.
Rinsing the worms is very important. Since the soap is irritating, the worms could die if soap residue remains on their bodies for too long.

, When your worms are clean, store them in a container with a perforated lit. Add some dirt with bits of leaves, or worm bedding to give the worms something to nest in. Keep the container in a cool, dark place until you need to use them.


Make sure that you do not repeat the soapy water process in the same area for at least a few weeks. It will make the area unappealing to worms. For this reason, you may also want to avoid using this method near compost piles, plants, or other areas where worms are beneficial."
"
Stick a pitchfork into the ground.,
Rock the pitchfork back and forth.,
Gather the worms.,
Store the worms.",How to Catch Worms3," Insert a pitchfork into the soil you are planning to collect your worms from.Again, remember that worms thrive in dirt that is moist, and nutrient-rich, with plants and crops nearby and with mulch covering the soil. Make sure the majority of the fork tenors are in the ground.

, Rock the pitchfork back and forth in a constant rhythm, almost wiggling the pitchfork in place.Worms will start to surface from the dirt.


This process may take a few minutes, so patience is key.

, Use your fingers to pick up the surfaced worms. They will be scattered, but be sure to maintain the rocking rhythm of the pitchfork., Keep your collected worms in a container with a perforated lid. The container should also have some dirt from which the worms can from, or some commercial worm bedding.


Keep the worms in a dark and cool place until you are ready to use them.

Detach your longboard trucks.,
Brush the grip tape with a nylon brush with water and soap.,
Rinse the grip-tape with a wet sponge.,
Flip the board and wipe down the underside with water and a sponge.,
Dry the board with a towel.,
Let the board dry for three hours and reattach your trucks.",How to Clean a Longboard1," You should remove your trucks before you start to clean your board. Water that gets on the metal part of your board can lead to corrosion and rust. The trucks are also large and will get in the way, making it more difficult to clean the board. To remove your trucks, flip your board over and use an adjustable wrench to remove the large nut between your wheels. Wiggle your trucks until they come loose, then lift them off of your board. Do this to both the front and the back wheels., Mix a bucket of water with a couple of drops of a mild dish soap or detergent and mix it until it starts to sud up. Dip a medium-hard nylon brush in the bucket and start to clean the surface of your grip tape with the brush. Use small semi-circlular motions when you’re cleaning the surface of your skateboard. The grime and dirt should start to come off.You can use a toothbrush as an alternative to a nylon brush.
There are also grip tape erasers that can help you maintain your board between deep cleanings.

, Soak a clean, soap-free sponge in some water. Once it’s saturated, transfer it to the grip-tape on your skateboard to remove any suds or leftover soap. Once all the soap has been eliminated, you can move onto the next step.


If your board becomes saturated, dry it off immediately as a waterlogged board can lead to warping and cracking., Use plain water and a soft sponge to clean the underside of your board. Longboards aren’t traditionally designed for tricks, so the underside of your board should still be somewhat smooth. Make sure to remove any built on dirt or debris as you clean.


Avoid getting the metal parts on the underside of your board wet.

, Dab the entire board down with a towel so that there is no moisture remaining on it. Use a cotton towel when doing this.


Paper towels or napkins rubbed against your grip tape will create a mess.

, Set your board in a dry area for three hours and allow it to dry off fully. Once it’s dried, use an adjustable wrench to place your trucks back in their position."

Remove your bearings.,
Peel away the bearing shields.,
Soak your bearings in a solvent or alcohol.,
Dry your bearings with a hairdryer.,
Re-grease your bearings.,
Snap the bearing shield back in place.,
Push your bearings back into your wheels.",How to Clean a Longboard2," Bearings are the round pieces of metal inside of each of your wheels. To remove the bearings from the wheels, unscrew your wheel from the axle completely. Then, fit the wheel over the end of the axle and use it as leverage to pop the bearing out of the center of your wheel. It may take a few tries before you can completely dislodge the bearing from the wheel.If your wheels make a lot of noise or don't spin well, there’s a good chance they need to be cleaned.

, There will be a plastic or metal shield that usually goes over your bearings. To remove the rubber bearing shields, take a flathead screwdriver or pin and wedge it under the rubber. Push downward on the screwdriver to pop the shield out of the bearing.You may damage the shield slightly while doing this, so be careful.

, Once you get all your shields separated from the bearings, you’ll want to soak them in a solvent or solution, like acetone, that will remove dirt and grease from them. Place your bearings in a bottle or jar with the solution and secure the lid. Shake the bottle for two minutes, or until all the dirt has been removed from your bearings.You can also use a citrus based cleaner with an orange oil or lemon juice to clean your bearings.

, Remove the bearings from the solvent and place them on a dry paper towel or rag. Set a hairdryer on high and place it over the bearings until all of the moisture has been dissolved.Be careful when handling the hot bearings because they can burn you.

, The proper lubricant will keep your wheels turning correctly when you skateboard. Use oil or grease that’s specifically meant to help lubricate the bearings on a skateboard. Place a drop or two of the lubricant with a dropper into the bearing. You can then roll the bearing on its side to distribute the grease throughout it.Oil will make your wheels turn faster but also makes your bearings less resistant to dirt and debris.
Synthetic grease will increase the longevity of your bearings and requires less maintenance, but will make your wheels spin slower than if you used oil.

, Place the metal or rubber bearing back in place and snap it on. Make sure that it is secure and that there aren’t any holes or dirt and dust may be able to enter your bearing. Your bearing shield will be different depending on what kind of bearings you have.

, Once you’ve put your bearing back together, it’s ready to go back onto your wheels. From there, you should be able to reattach the wheels to your longboard's axle.


You should conduct regular maintenance on your bearings, especially if they are noisy or they are not spinning properly.

Rinse your board off with water after you surf.,
Let the wax soften in the sun for an hour.,
Scrape off the wax with a credit card or wax comb.,
Wash your board down with water and a mild dish soap.,
Remove the remainder of the wax and grime with WD-40.,
Dry your board down with a rag.",How to Clean a Longboard3," Salt water can be corrosive to your board if it isn’t rinsed after you surf. Use a public water source to rinse off your board right as you come off the beach to remove the salt water from it., Before you clean your longboard, you'll want to remove the wax that is most likely on it. If your wax is cold or at room temperature, it’s going to be relatively hard to scrape off. A way to get around this is to allow the heat from the sun to soften the wax first. Once the wax is soft, move your board to a cleaning area outside.

, Work from the top of your board down to the bottom and scrape off all of the wax that’s on the surface of the board. A wax comb is an industrial surfer tool that you can use to remove the wax quickly. If you don’t have that, you can use a credit card. Move from one side of the board to the other and remove the layer of wax from your board.If you are having problems lifting the wax from your board, you can drip some liquid coconut oil onto the surface of your board to try to loosen it.

, Soap will keep your board clean and can prevent mildew and bacteria from growing on it. Saturate a sponge with soap and water and use to clean your board. Once you’ve covered the entirety of the board, rinse it off with a hose.You can also use inflatable boat cleaner.

, WD-40 will help loosen existing dirt and any left over wax that might still be on your board. Spray some of the solution onto dirtier areas of your board and then go over them with a rag. Make sure to rinse and wipe down the area after you use the WD-40.Use citrus cleaner as an all-natural alternative to WD-40.

, Use a dry cotton rag to wipe up the rest of the moisture from your longboard. When it’s dry, put your longboard in a sock, or a cloth covering and keep it out of direct sunlight.Remember to re-wax your longboard before you take it out to the ocean again.

Provide active supervision.",How to Check the Safety of Your Child's Playground," Many playgrounds have a surface of wood chips, sand, or pea gravel. To provide an appropriate soft landing and prevent injury, this surface fill should be at least a foot deep and not have a hard surface such as asphalt beneath it.Some playgrounds have mats, especially if they are indoors. These mats should be safety-tested and made of rubber or a rubber-like material. Inspect the mats for any holes or tears.;
, The fill or mats covering the surface around equipment should extend at least 6 feet (1.8 m) (about 2m) from the equipment in all directions, to allow for softer landings in the case of a fall from the equipment.Swings should potentially have a larger landing surface, at least twice the height of the suspending bar both in front and behind the swing set.

, Particularly in outdoor playgrounds, there may be tree stumps, rocks, or concrete footings that a child could easily trip over while running and playing. If you aren't able to remove these, you should at least point them out to your child.Keep in mind that pointing out a hazard doesn't do much to prevent your child from tripping, especially if they get caught up in play and are running without being careful. However, it can help if both you and the child are aware.
You also want to inspect the ground around swings closely to ensure there aren't any large rocks or other debris that could injure a child falling or jumping off the swing.
If there are too many tripping hazards, you may want to forbid your child from running or find a different playground without as many hazards.

, Outdoor playgrounds on concrete or asphalt, dirt, or even grass don't provide enough cushioning to reduce the impact of a fall. These playgrounds can be very dangerous, particularly if there is elevated equipment.Generally speaking, you shouldn't allow your child to play on playgrounds with these types of surfaces at all. However, if most of the equipment is low to the ground and there's not much risk of the child getting seriously injured when they fall, it might be okay. Just be sure to keep a close watch.

, If there are any elevated parts of the playground, such as the top of a slide or a suspended bridge, these should be equipped with handrails or guardrails to prevent children from falling from a height.Keep in mind that a fall from a height, even onto a soft landing surface, can result in a concussion or serious brain injury. If you have any concerns about the safety of elevated equipment, accompany your child on that part of the playground.
If accompanying your child isn't possible, forbid them to access the parts of the playground you believe are risky for them.

, Some playground equipment is built with treated lumber. Treated lumber contains arsenic, which can be found on the lumber itself and in any fill or surface surrounding the equipment.If your child is playing on a treated lumber playground, caution them never to put their hands in their mouths.
Wash your child's hands thoroughly with soap and water when they're done playing, and don't allow them to eat while playing on a treated lumber playground.

, Go over the playground equipment carefully, including areas underneath the structures, and make sure there aren't any bolts or screws sticking out that could snag your child.If bolts or screws are loose, check the structure to make sure it's still stable. If you have doubts about whether the structure is stable, don't allow your child to play on that equipment.

, If your child is playing on a public playground, you should be walking through it every time your child visits. Any hazards you spot should be fixed so that other children aren't also exposed to the safety risk.Find out who is in charge of inspecting and maintaining the playground so you know who to contact if you see something dangerous on the child's playground.
Contact the person in charge of the playground and find out how it is maintained, how often it is inspected for damage or hazards, and when repairs were last made.

, The chains by which swings are attached to suspension bars can pinch tiny hands. If the swing is hanging by a chain, make sure all the links are closed. Ideally the chain will have a rubber or plastic swing to protect the child's hands.Swings hung by rope also can cause rope burns on your child's hands if used improperly. Check ropes carefully to make sure they are not frayed.
Don't let your child swing on swings if there are any open or protruding hooks or S-links, or if the chains or bars are rusty or unstable.

, The safest swings have plastic or rubber seats. Metal seats can cut your child, as well as getting very hot in the summer. Wooden seats have the danger of splinters.Wooden seats also may break more easily than other materials, leading to a dangerous fall.
Even if the seats are made of plastic or rubber, inspect them carefully for damage before you allow your child to use them.

, The space between equipment is particularly important with taller structures, which should be separated from other equipment by at least 9 feet (2.7 m) so children won't collide with other equipment in the event of a fall.If you have concerns about the spacing of equipment, you may want to stand nearby while the child uses that equipment so you can act as a spotter.

, Many playgrounds have ladders for children to climb to reach more elevated play places. If the rungs of the ladder are less than 3.5 inches, or more than 9 inches apart, the child's arm or leg could get trapped there.If you're concerned about the safety of the ladder, stand nearby and assist the child when they climb the ladder, or don't allow them to use the ladder at all.
Be especially cautious with rope ladders, particularly if your child is younger or has a mental or physical condition that affects their balance or coordination.

, Your child needs to understand how to use playground equipment safely and how to behave on the playground, as well as how to play well with other children.Keep in mind that younger children play differently than older children. If there are a lot of older children on the playground, you may want to take your younger child somewhere else. Similarly, if your child is older, teach them to take care and look out for younger kids who might be playing.
Make sure your child understands how to use the equipment correctly, and not to try risky or dangerous stunts that could lead to injury.

, Many playgrounds, especially those at public parks or schools, have rules of conduct posted somewhere near the entrance to the playground. While most of these will be basically the same, some will vary depending on the playground's equipment and location.Both you and your child should be familiar with these rules. Make sure your child understands them and has agreed to follow them before you allow the child to play.

, If it's your first time visiting a particular playground, touring it with your child allows you to point out any hazards as well as explain to your child the proper uses of equipment.Ask your child questions to actively involve them in the experience. Get them thinking about which pieces of equipment they want to use, as well as which things make them nervous.
Let them know if there are any pieces of equipment that are off limits, or that you want to be nearby when they use them, and explain the dangers posed.

, If you have a younger child, seek out a playground at an elementary school that is geared toward your child's age group, rather than a larger public playground where there may be equipment for older children.Some playgrounds have separate areas set apart for younger children as well.
Keep in mind that children can be tempted to play on equipment they're too young to use, especially if they want to impress other kids who might be around.

, No matter how safe the playground, children are more likely to get hurt if they are playing without supervision. Active supervision means you are paying attention to your child and watching them closely.Make sure your child is clearly and directly visible at all times. It's not necessary to hover over your child, but you should be within a few feet of them, especially when they're younger.
Avoid distractions while your child is playing on the playground. Don't check text messages on your phone or answer a phone call. Just a few seconds is all it takes for the child to get into a dangerous situation.

Decide what you want the knife for.,
Think about price.,
Decide where you will carry it.,
Know the laws for carrying knives.,
Buy the knife as a gift.,
Visit a store.,
Examine each tool in the knife.,
Think about high-tech tools.,
Purchase knife care products.",How to Choose a Swiss Army Knife," If you want to go for practicality, it is important to consider what you intend to do with the knife. This will prevent you from buying knives that have too many tools, as they can be bulkier and more expensive.There are several broad categories of knife users, and where you fit among them can offer good clues on what to look for in a knife. They can be used for everyday carry, backwoods use, hunting and fishing, and home handiwork. Each of these types of uses will emphasize different tools, and your own experiences will help decide which are necessary.One way to help yourself think is to make a list of things you need to have on your knife for it to be useful. Then, make a list of tools you would really like having on your knife, even though you might not use them too often. This will help you limit your options while shopping, and get the knife best suited for your needs.
Another way to help think about your needs is to put yourself in a situation where you intend to use the knife, say a camping trip, or doing repairs around the house. Make a note of all the times you thought a pocket tool would be useful, and how often you thought about that. This should give you a pretty good sense of the tools you want to be looking for.;
, Good knives aren’t expensive, but you will probably have a price point in your mind that you don’t want to go over. Your list of necessary tools will help limit this as well, though you will also need to consider manufacturer quality as well.


A manufacturer’s website is a good place to start. They will have detailed, accurate descriptions of their knives, which should give you a good sense of what certain items cost.
When you compare prices, don’t look at the manufacturers only. Check online retailers and in-store displays to get the best sense of the price ranges.

, The great benefit of a pocket knife is having it on you at all times. There are a number of places you can carry the knife, and these will affect the size of knife you get.You can always put it in your pocket, just like the name suggests. Your pocket should be deep, and secure, so the knife won’t fall out when you are sitting. Your best bet is a cargo pocket to cover the top, or a dedicated slot in the fabric. That way, you will always know where your knife is, and it won’t get jostled around with other items.
Some pocket knives, even the multi-tool ones, come with a clip. This clip could attach to a key ring, or be used to hold your knife on a belt loop or the edge of a pocket. This can give you the flexibility to get a smaller knife to fit on the key chain, or a larger one that doesn’t need to fit inside your pocket.
You will also want to consider the easiest way for your dominant hand to access the knife. That is the hand you will actually use the knife with, so you will want to get it on the knife without too much hassle.

, Knives are not as heavily regulated as guns or other types of weapons, but can be a number of restrictions surrounding where you can carry or use a knife. Small folding blades like Swiss Army Knives are usually okay, but make sure you are familiar with these laws before you start searching for a knife, just to be sure.According to the Transportation Security Administration, small pocket knives are on the Prohibited Items List, and cannot be carried on to airplanes.Domestic travelers can carry them in checked bags, while rules for international flights depend on the country you are travelling to.If you fly a lot, you might want a cheaper knife. That way, if you forget to leave it at home, and TSA takes it from you, it’s less of a loss.
States and municipalities have a variety of laws dealing with the ownership of blades. Most state laws allow the concealment of blades less than 3 inches long, like a Swiss Army Knife, though in general you must keep the knife closed while carrying it. Some states do have age laws. In New York, for example, you need to be 16 to possess “any dangerous knife.”Many public buildings, like courthouses, schools, or other office buildings, forbid the carrying of knives, even the small folding knives like your Swiss Army Knife. Some private businesses will ban them as well., Narrowing down options can be a bit tougher if the knife isn't for you, but instead is a gift for someone else. Unless you want to tell the person what you are getting, and ask about their desires, you will need to exercise some judgment. Think about the person you are purchasing the knife for, and how you hope he will use it.


A beginning user, like a child, doesn't need a large knife with a variety of gadgets. A knife with one or two blades should be enough. Of course, you will also want to make sure the recipient is familiar with knife care and safety. That way, he'll use it properly, and have something that can last for a long time.If you are purchasing for a more advanced user, he will probably have more specific needs. You will want to balance versatility with heft, as he will consider the knife's weight and need for using it when packing.Alternatively, if you expect this person to be pickier, you may consider a larger knife with a variety of gadgets. It won't necessarily be practical, but that isn't the point. The knife becomes a souvenir or conversation piece, a nice way to recognize something important to him.
High tech users. Newer knives on the market include fancy technology like USB drives and LED flashlights. These can be a great gift for someone more tech-savvy. They might also enjoy a knife that includes a screwdriver, or other tools that would be useful for small gadgets, or computers with small parts.
The most famous brand of knives from Switzerland is Victorinox, which holds the copyright to the term ""Swiss Army Knife."" Victorinox also owns the brand Wenger, the other prominent Swiss knife manufacturer. These knives are easy to spot due to their red shell and Swiss cross.There are many other brands of pocket knives, plenty of which are also quality. For a gift, you may prefer the name recognition, but consult with a knife or outdoor supply store for other reliable manufacturers.

, Because so much of the knife’s use involves your comfort, you should take a visit to an outdoors shop to sample and handle blades before buying. Pictures online can’t compare to holding the knife in your hand and getting a real feel for how the size and weight will impact your usage.


While you are at the store, try handling a variety of knives. Use both hands and different grips to ensure you have something that you will be comfortable using in any circumstance.You don’t need to purchase the knife at the store, especially if you can get a better deal online. You should make sure you feel comfortable holding and using a certain model before pulling out your credit card.

, The benefit of a Swiss Army Knife isn’t the main blade, but the variety of additional tools you get with it. Check that you can open and close each one of them easily. Also make sure each tool is the size you will need.


Open everything on each knife you look at. While looking through the knives, you may find a tool you didn't know existed, or you forgot about, that you really like. As long as it doesn’t interfere with the tools you’ve already decided that you need, it can be a nice addition to your knife.

, Swiss Army Knives are becoming even more versatile in their gadgets. There are knives out on the market that include USB drives, LED flashlights, and digital clocks. Like any other tool, these will impact the size and price of your knife., To make sure your knife stays useful for a long time after purchase, make sure you have other products necessary to keep it in top shape. The most important maintenance needs of a Swiss Army Knife are sharpening and oiling. Just don’t forget to use these items after you buy them!


For sharpening the blade, you will want a sharpening stone or honing rod. The blade on a pocket knife is very thin, so you don’t want anything too coarse. If you have a knife set at home, the honing rod there is good to use, though you may want a small stone to take with you out in the woods.
You will need to regularly oil the hinges where the blades come out. This will prevent gunk from getting in there, allowing your knife to open easily and safely. Some knife companies produce their own cleaning oil, but you can also soak the hinges in warm water to keep them loose.You can also use vegetable oil to help keep the hinges lubricated."

, Does the aircraft have one or more wings? At least one wing is needed. It is narrow perspective and false to force soft canopy for the set of wings; certainly there are soft-canopy paragliders, but there are also stiff-framed paraglider; and fully solid wings may be the wing or wings of a paraglider.

, Does the aircraft have a freely falling mass at the lower end of the tether or tethers? Some mass is needed to be pulled by gravity at the end of the tether or tethers that go up to the wing or wings.

, In flight, does the tether generally stay in tension because of the deflective actions of the coupled wing or wings with the mass at the lower end of the tether or tethers?

Consider the gear you may need on your belt.,
Consider the type of climbing you will be doing.,
Try on several harnesses before purchasing a mountain climbing harness.",How to Buy a Climbing Harness," A 10-minute excursion up an indoor wall requires different equipment from an overnight trip on the side of a mountain.


Leg loops are not necessary for short climbs, but are a vital piece of mountain climbing equipment for longer climbs. If you plan a long climb, look for adjustable leg loops, which you can resize to allow you to fit different types of clothing to match your climbing environment.
Gear loops are used for carrying equipment. A recreational harness may have only 2 gear loops, and they may never be used. A specialized harness has 4 or more gear loops so that you can bring food, weather gear, and any other essentials with you.
The more gear you plan to carry on your climbing belt, the more padding you need for comfort. For some applications, such as mountain rescue, you may also require additional lumbar support.;
,


For recreational climbing, whether indoor or outdoor, you can get away with a comparatively inexpensive climbing harness with no accessories. A recreational harness is fine for short-term use.
A traditional harness has leg loops, gear loops, and light padding, but is not suitable for long excursions or climbing in extreme conditions.
Ice harnesses are designed to stand up to extremely cold temperatures. They feature adjustable leg loops to fit over cold-weather clothing, additional gear loops for equipment such as ice picks, and extra padding for additional support because of the additional equipment required for cold-weather climbing.
Mountaineering harnesses are lighter weight than ice harnesses. These harnesses are designed to be worn with a backpack on which you carry your gear.

, The harness you choose should be comfortable. You should fit in it at the middle settings, so that you can tighten or loosen it based on the requirements of different climbs. Some mountain climbing equipment stores offer an indoor testing station you can use to be sure you can hang comfortably in the harness before purchasing it.

Firstly, lay out all the equipment you are going to use-whatever pattern it is.,
Start with your rucksack, this is the biggest piece of your personal kit so needs the most camouflage.,
Next, move on to the helmet.,
Be careful with webbing.,
Be extremely cautious when disguising your weapon.,
Vehicles really need a vehicle camouflage net.",How to Camouflage Equipment," These instructions should cover rucksacks, webbing, weapon, helmet and vehicles.;
, The rucksack forms a large part of your silhouette, so its distinctive shape needs to be broken up. Do this by attaching pieces of scrim to tabs on the sides and top of the rucksack, being careful not to cover any zips or openings. Once this is done, you can attach local camouflage. As you come across it. If you can, stand back and look at the bag from a few meters away, and check that the shape is hidden.

, British Army helmets have a camouflage cover in Woodland or desert DPM and have straps and tabs for attaching camouflage. Start by breaking up the shape with scrim, hessian, burlap and cloth. Once this is done, push local vegetation into the straps. Make it secure and check that it does not impair your vision. Check that the shape is hidden entirely.

, Webbing is a dangerous bit of kit to camouflage, you mustn't camouflage it in such a way that you may not be able to access any part of it quickly. Put some scrim between the pouches, stitched with a few stitches of cotton. Also make a loop that you can slide over the belt buckle, especially if it is metal, and sew scrim strips to the loop. Repeat this for any other buckles on the webbing (this also helps to dampen 'jingle').

, Your weapon is the most important item you are carrying. In the case of automatic and semi-automatic firearms, you must be careful not to cover the magazine, cocking handle, trigger, forward hand guard or pistol grip, select-fire switch, stock or the SIGHTS! So, there is not much left to camouflage then... Well the modern weapon really requires a paint job to be camouflaged. Diagonal strips of 3-colour scheme paint should do the job, though ensure the width and pattern varies to stop a pattern from appearing. If heavier camouflage is required, scrim around the barrel can be attached, but ensure that this does not block the sights. Scrim can be wrapped around Sniper rifle scopes, and put a lens cap over both ends to reduce reflections.

, Put up a frame over the vehicle to destroy its silhouette then spread the net over that. Most modern vehicle nets are double-sided, to give the best camouflage for the situation. The more expensive nets are IRR proofed, so that the vehicle's infra-red signature is reduced-so it may be used for personal camouflage. Try to damage surrounding ground etc... as little as possible.

Choose a composite, carbon fiber, or e-glass fishing rod.,
Obtain sweetcorn or boilies for bait.,
Get a strong monofilament or braided line.,
Purchase barbed hooks to keep the fish on the line.,
Make sure you have comfortable clothes.,
Feed your line through the rings of your rod, leaving slack to the line.,
Add a stop knot, or float stop to the top of your line, above your float.,
String the line through the float.,
Add a weight under the float.,
Tie the swivel to the line.,
Cut a long piece of line and attach the hook.,
Find an area that’s filled with plant life and vegetation.,
Cast your line into the water.,
Sit back and watch your float to see if any carp are biting.,
Use the lift method if carp are eating your bait but not biting.,
Reel in the carp once it’s hooked.,
Use a net and scoop the carp out of the water.",How to Catch a Carp," Graphite rods can shatter under the pressure of a bigger fish, so unless you are fishing for smaller carp, you should try to avoid them. There are various brands on the market, but you should do your research, read customer reviews, and consider your budget if you need to purchase a different rod.


If you’re fishing for small carp, a graphite rod with a 3 lb. test curve will work.
Common carp can grow to be 60 pounds and require a good rod if you hook one.A 7-12 foot rod will will give you enough flex if you need to reel in a larger fish.;
, Carp love sweet corn out of the can, and it can make for some of the best bait if you’re fishing for them. While any corn may work, sweet corn contains added sugars and salts, as well as critical amino acids which make it ideal food for carp.


Boilies are fishing bait made of fish or milk proteins, eggs, and grains, and are an alternative to corn.The bright color of the corn also catches the carps' attention.
Some other carp baits include carp pellets, hemp, tiger nuts, maize, chickpeas and maggots.

, If there’s a chance you’ll bag a bigger carp, you want to make sure that your line is strong enough to carry the load of a large fish. Determine the average weight of the carp you’re fishing for, then buy a monofilament line with a tensile strength that will be able to carry its load. Tensile strength can usually be found on the box, or on the side of the product. If you know that you’re fishing for smaller one to two pound carp or smaller, braided line will also work.


Monofilament also enables you to tie reliable knots in your line which is important for certain types of fishing.
A nylon monofilament line is a single strand line that has near-neutral buoyancy and the ability to stretch and absorb the shock of a larger fish., Here, bigger hooks are not better as carp are highly adaptive and will typically nibble at bait before taking the whole thing in their mouth.Carp are able to see, taste, and smell a larger hook, so they won't usually try to bite one if it's big and obvious.Make sure to check that barbed hooks are legal where you are fishing, as they are restricted in some fishing areas.

, When choosing the right outfit, make sure to choose clothes that are weather appropriate. There’s a good chance that if you’re fishing in carp heavy waters, there will be a lot of mud and algae in the area. For that reason, it would also be a good idea to get a good set of boots so that you don’t get trench foot.


It’s important that your clothes will work for all times of day. Sometimes the temperature drastically changes when it starts to get dark outside.
Trench foot is a dangerous condition from keeping your feet wet and results in swelling, numbness, and pain. , The amount of slack to leave all depends on the depths of the waters that you are fishing. For carp, you want to make sure that your bait is on the bottom of the waterbed because that is where carp like to feed.


When fishing in 5 foot waters, leave at least 5 feet of slack.
The extra line is required for the float, weight, and hook.

, The float will move up on your line when in the water until it’s stopped by your rod. For that reason, adding a stop knot or float stop will make it so you can regulate where the float will stay on the end of your line. Leave plenty of space between your float and your knot so that your bait will be on the bottom of the lake or river you're fishing in. Where you put the knot depends on the depth of the fish, but as a rule of thumb it should be two to three arm lengths above the swivel.You can create a stop knot out of rubber tubing by feeding your line through the center and then feeding the line through it again., The float will have a hole in the middle. Take the slack from the end of your line and string it through the float. While they aren't necessary for carp fishing, floats enable the angler to tell when there are carp are nibbling at his bait. Because of how sensitive they are, it would be very hard to determine this with out one.


A float will help you indicate whether you have something on your line as well as give you control over the depth of your hook.
Waggler floats are commonly used as floats for float fishing.

, Weights weigh down the line so your bait can reach the bottom, where carp feed. It will also make sure that your line isn’t going downstream with the current. Your weight should be right above your swivel, around 5-9 inches away from your hook.


If you notice that you’re line is traveling too far from where you cast it, add a heavy weight to the end of the line.

, A swivel allows your hook to move in a 180 degree radius which will prevent your line from twisting and breaking if you hook a carp. This is especially important because carp are known to twist and turn to escape.There are three different types of swivels and include barrel, crane, and ball bearing swivels.
Ball bearing swivels are the best quality because they can handle the highest load., The idea is that the hook and line will be on the bottom of lake floor. Because carp are bottom dwellers, you want to make sure to make the extra piece of line long enough so that the hook is at the bottom with seven inches of slack.


You can calculate this by figuring out the depth of the water you’re fishing, then adding seven inches to the slack below your stop knot.
Some carp anglers have a smaller hook that hangs off a larger hook as a decoy, so if the fish tries to eat around the larger hook it will still get on your line.

, Carp will feed on nearby vegetation and the insects and other animals that feed on it as well.These are ideal areas to set up when fishing for carp. Carp prefer shallow water during hot weather and deeper water during cold weather.Make sure to find a place where you can comfortably sit for a couple of hours.
Carp are known to be very touchy and require patience to catch.

, If you see a school of carp feeding, you don’t want to cast directly on top them because they scare easily. A better idea is to cast ahead in the current, to where the carp may swim to to feed.


The closer you have your weights attached to your float, the easier it will be to cast your line into the water., Carp are intelligent fish and will eat around your hook. In some cases, they will take the entire bait before you even know they are under you. Watch your float carefully. If it starts to bob up and down, it’s possible that a carp is nibbling at your bait.


It’s easy to confuse water current with a fish biting on your bait, so before you reel in make sure it’s a good bite.
Your float will be quickly submerged if there is a carp on your hook.

, Sometimes your float will lift out of the water rather than becoming submerged, and this is a big indicator that carp are eating around your bait. For this method, wait until your float lifts out of the water, then jerk back your in an upward motion and start to reel it in. Doing this will hook any carp that has a hook in its mouth, but has not taken your bait.


This may result in reeling in nothing some of the time, especially if you’re not used to float fishing.

, Once the carp takes a real bite out of your hook, hold onto your pole tightly and smoothly pull it in an upward direction.


Work the reel up in a smooth motion to bring the carp closer to you gradually.
Allow the carp to tire itself out before pulling it out of the water.

, The best way to safely pull a carp out of the water is with a net. Make sure that the carp is tired already, and place the net under it in the water. Grab the carp by putting one hand on the bottom of its belly and the other safely secured on its tail. To prevent yourself from getting cut by its fins, make sure to wear gloves. Once you have the carp, remove the hook from its mouth.


For carp that thrash after you catch them, apply a wet dark cloth over its eyes so you can remove the hook.
Don't pick up the fish by its mouth as you would with a bass, because you could easily damage it.

Fish at the proper locations.,
Look for the fish in the shallows—typically, between 1 and 3 feet of water.,
Use lightweight tackle.,
For spin fishermen, use a 1/4 ounce flats bucktail jig tipped with a fresh shrimp tail.

,
Cast between 1 and 3 feet from the bonefish - preferably up-current from the fish.

,
Allow the jig to reach the bottom, then lightly twitch the rod upwards once, and retrieve one turn of the reel.,
Once the bonefish tugs on the line, wait to strike until the rod bends.

,
Expect the fish to run 100+ feet very quickly.

,Take your time bringing in the fish.",How to Catch a Bonefish," Bonefish inhabit warm saltwater. Excellent places to fish for them include the Bahamas, Key West and the Florida Keys, Costa Rica, and other Caribbean destinations.;
, Bonefish tend to blend in with their surroundings and often all one can see is their shadow.

, Bonefish can refuse or spook from any noticeable leader material.

,,, Continue bouncing the jig along the bottom as you slowly retrieve.

Get the right lure.,
Use live bait.,
Pick a reel.",How to Catch a Bass1," There are three major types of lures that are the best for catching bass. You can get crank baits, spinner baits, and plastic worms. They can all be used successfully no matter the location or the time of year. The main aspect of the lure you need to consider is the color you choose for them. You should have two of each lure for your tackle box, one in a natural color and one in a bright, vibrant color.


Crank bait are small lures that look like small, live fish. There are two three-point hooks on each lure, one under the belly and one at the tail. The lures also have a flat plastic area on the lip of the fish. Try the Jackall Boil Trigger and the Rapala Ultra Light Crank.
Spinner bait have two main parts. There is one arm that has large, curved pieces of metal called blades, and there can be one or multiple blades. The other arm is the same length with a hook on the end. The hook is sometimes covered in plastic wig that hides the hook or hooks. Try the Panther Martin or the Blue Fox Vibrax Spinner Minnow. The spinner arms can also be shaped like a fish, which can make it look similar to the crank fish. The difference is the crank fish has two three-pronged hooks and a lip while the spinner has one hook and blades.
Plastic worms look like large earthworms and have a hook embedded into them. The fish are hooked once they try to eat the worm, so they are effective but require a bit of patience.;
, If you don't want to use lures, you can also fish using live bait. The most prominent types of live bait for bass are worms, minnows, and crawfish. Worms are easy to keep and carry around, and you can keep them in the refrigerator in dirt if you don't use all of what you bought on your first fishing trip. Minnows and crawfish are harder to handle because you have to keep them in a bucket with water while you fish. You can also frogs, salamanders, and insects.


The best kind of minnows for bass are shiner and the creek minnow variety., There are two main types of reels used in bass fishing. You can use a spinning reel, which is also known as an open faced reel. You can also get a spin cast reel, which is also known as a closed face reel. The main difference between the two types is the level of expertise needed from the person fishing. The closed face reel is great for beginners and doesn't require any advanced moves. The spinning reel needs more dexterity to maneuver.


The spinning reel is a fixed spool with the line exposed. It is built to use 4 to 12 lb test line and can move the handle between the right and left sides. It allows easy casting but requires you to stop the line by hand. To do this, cast out your line. To stop the line, flip the metal lever over the top of the spool and hold the line with your finger.
The spin cast reel is rated for 4 to 12 lb test line but can take up to 20 lb. It is also simple to cast. You hold down the button on the front of the reel and release it as you cast your line. Once it gets to where you want the line to go, rotate the handle just a little to reengage the locking function on the reel.
The test line rating is the most weight that the line is tested for. The range of weights can be as small as a few pounds to upwards of 50 pounds.
Each reel has a rod of the same name that is used with it as well. If you are planning on catching larger bass, you need to get a rod with medium to medium light power. If you are just catching small bass, get a rod with light power. The power of a rod is its weight capacity and is usually written on the side of the rod. This measurement can be listed as a phrase such as light, medium, or medium light, or as a number between 1-10."

As secretive as muskie anglers can be with their honey holes, there are many ways to determine whether these fish swim in your body of water. Perhaps most reliable is to use your state or province’s Division of Natural Resources. Also check local fishing forums, clubs, and bait shops.Go to the Division of Natural Resources’ website for the state you plan to fish in. You should be able to find local bodies of water, such as lakes and creeks, where muskellunge can be found, as well as reservoirs that stock them.;
, Muskie water can be daunting to analyze. These fish live in lakes that are frequently thousands of acres, and knowing where to start can be a challenge.Being familiar with migratory patterns is therefore critical. Look up the current water temperature for the body of water you’ve selected.From the initial thaw through early spring, when water temperatures range from the upper 40s to low 50s Fahrenheit (about 7 to 12 degrees Celsius), focus on the shallowest parts of the lake.
Once water temperatures reach the mid-50s Fahrenheit (about 13 Celsius), fish in depths of five to twelve feet.
At 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 Celsius), focus on the fish’s summer homes: deeper structures, such as deep weed beds, submerged rock piles and timber.
In autumn when the water dips back into the 60s and 50s Fahrenheit (10 to 20 Celsius), fish in the shallows where there are schools of prey, such as shad, perch, and whitefish.
When the water cools to the 40s and 30s Fahrenheit (-1 to 9 Celsius), fish in deeper water where muskies reside throughout the frozen months. This is often when you can catch the largest fish.

, The adage of fishing at the “crack of dawn” is not entirely true. Like all fish, muskies cold blooded, and so their body temperature is a direct product of their environment. As a result, in early spring and late fall periods, muskie are actually most active during the warmest hours of the day when the sun is directly overhead. During the warmest months of the year, the opposite is true, and muskies find their most ideal hunting temperatures at dusk and dawn.

, If you fish during the daytime, choose a day with a new or full moon. If you’ll be fishing at night, pick a night with a full moon. Solunar calendars have been developed for muskie fishing for years, establishing that fishing during these moon phases are an advantage for anglers., Many successful muskie anglers keep a running log of fish seen and fish caught. Using either a map or a GPS system, keep track of the day, time, and location of each muskie encounter to generate a reproducible seasonal pattern. As seasons pass, add new spots to your log.


Over time a body of water can essentially become an algorithm, where you need only to plug in the conditions and season to know where you should fish.

, Use heavy tackle. Adult muskellunge can grow in excess of 50 inches and 50 lbs (22.7 kg). Try heavy action rods from seven to nine feet long. Pair a muskie rod with a large bait-casting reel, preferably in a fast gear ratio, to allow “catching up” to fast-moving fish.Heavy action rods have the backbone to not only fight such a large fish, but also to cast the jumbo-sized lures used to target muskies.

, The higher a line’s “pound test” is, the stronger the line will be. In order to prevent line breaks and missed fish, use heavy, braided line with a pound test between 80 and 100. Because muskies have such sharp teeth, connect the main line to the lure with either a steel or heavy fluorocarbon leader., The variety of muskie lures available can be overwhelming. Muskies are notorious predators who eat nearly every other freshwater fish in their waters, other muskies, frogs, and even rodents.In general, don’t be intimidated by using baits that seem absurdly large. Muskies frequently prey on fish 25%-50% their length, so using 8-12” lures is well within reason.Keep in mind that these fish are cold-blooded, and so their activity level is determined heavily by the season and water temperatures.


In colder water, fish are more sluggish. Select small baits such as rattle traps and crank baits.
In more ideal water temperatures, from the 60s to the low 70s in Fahrenheit (15.5°C to just above 21°C), fish are much more active. Use larger baits such as rubbers and swimbaits.

, In cold water, look for lazier, slow baits like glide baits, jerk baits and jib baits to draw more strikes. In warmer water, use fast-moving baits like bucktails, spinnerbaits and topwaters. When the water temperature is hot, the fish will be sluggish, so use deeper and slower baits.


When water visibility is low, look for baits with rattles, large blades, or other mechanisms of creating noise and water movement. Aside from typical auditory organs, muskies also utilize the lateral line, which is a set of sensory organs that run down the length of many freshwater fish. This lateral line system can detect small changes in water movement and pressure gradients created by prey (and lures) when visibility is decreased., In clear waters, natural colors and patterns work best. In stained or muddier waters, anglers should use lures that are easier to detect.


When the water is clear, “match the hatch.” For example, use perch imitations in waters where perch are the predominant forage, and shad imitations in waters where shad are the predominant forage.
When the water has low visibility, opt for bright colors like chartreuse, orange, or white. Alternately, choose very dark colors such as black to provide the greatest contrast to dirty water.

, Deciding how to retrieve a lure depends on water conditions and fish activity levels. In ideal conditions when fish are active, use a more rapid retrieve. Slower retrieves are necessary in both cold and warmer summer waters.


When the fish give you positive feedback by either following your bait or actually biting, try to repeat that retrieval pattern throughout the day and when you encounter similar conditions.
Muskie are famous for stalking baits before deciding to strike. While they can often be seen following behind a lure, more frequently they follow just out of site. For this reason, perform at least one figure-eight maneuver boatside at the end of each retrieval. The change in direction often triggers hesitant fish, and the figure-eight itself gives an angler more time to notice a fish closing in on the bait.

, Always use sharp hooks. Since large hooks right out of the package are often dull, bring a sharpening tool designed for large hooks. Carry jaw spreaders, needlenose pliers, a long-handled hook remover, and either a mini bolt cutter or side cutters. Bring a cradle, or if that’s not possible, a large net.Try to use a net only if you plan to keep the fish. If you must use a net and you plan to release the fish, your net should have rubber-coated bags to reduce the fish’s mucus loss.A deep net (about 52”) with an opening between 34 and 44 inches should suffice. Make sure to net the muskie head-first.These essential tools will protect the fish as well as you as an angler, since you will be handling the business end of a toothy fish as well as very large hooks.

, Allowing the fish to remain in the water for unhooking and initial handling is essential to the well-being of trophy muskies and the maintenance of our fisheries. Grab the back of the hook with your pliers and lift it.Use a long-handled hook remover to retrieve hard-to-reach hooks. If a hook is embedded too deeply to remove it, use sidecutters or a mini bolt cutter to trim the points off the hook., Don’t put your hand in the fish’s mouth or gills to retrieve your hook. If the fish thrashes, its teeth or gill rakers could injure you.Hold a small muskie firmly across its back, right behind its gill covers. If the muskie is large, hold it by the tail and under the body while it’s still in the water boatside, so another person can free the hooks. Do this inside of a cradle, if possible.


Always wear gloves when handling muskies. The gloves should be protective fishing gloves that are puncture resistant.
Leave the fish in the water within the net or cradle as long as possible, removing it only briefly to photograph or measure it. Despite their size and ferocity, these fish are not known to be hardy and do not tolerate extensive handling well., You can help preserve the quality of muskie fishing by practicing catch-and-release. Bring a camera with you to take a photo of your catch. Don’t keep the fish unless you are going to have it mounted.Slide the muskie into a cradle to release it into the water, so that it doesn’t injure itself.Revive the fish by rocking it gently back and forth before releasing it. Don’t release the muskie until it remains upright by itself – in other words, it shouldn’t be lying on its side in the water.

Look in lakes, rivers and streams with clear water.,
Find crappie near submerged brush piles and treetops.,
Fish around piers and docks.,
Use a fish finder to find bottom breaks with cover.",How to Catch a Crappie1," Crappie are freshwater fish that are abundant in the wild and stocked in many ponds and lakes in the United States and Canada. They're originally from North America, but they can be found in many countries across the world at this point. Black crappie and white crappie are virtually indistinguishable, and many anglers don't notice the difference.;
, Crappie like to spend time around cover, and brush piles and treetops, fallen logs, or other debris piles are a great place to look for them.


You can actually build a brush shelter for crappie as a way to attract them to a certain part of the lake. Carry large branches and sticks to an area of the lake with no other shelter nearby, then let it fall to the bottom. Take note of the spot; chances are, next time you visit, crappie will be hanging out nearby.
Sometimes crappie like to hang out in the water between branches and sticks, rather than next to them. Some of the largest fish may spend time in the crevices of a fallen tree branch. Skilled anglers can fish in these crevices.

, When there's no natural covering in the water, crappie will gather near these human-made structures. This is a good place to look for those who are fishing from the dock, rather than from a boat.

, Crappie spend time in deep water areas that have some kind of covering, like underwater brush or sunken wood. Finding a place where other fishermen rarely fish is key for finding large fish."

Buy a fishing rod and line.,
Buy fishhooks, bobbers, and other gear.,
Experiment with different types of bait.,
Choose a bait size that matches the size of the fish you want to catch.,
Keep the bait fresh.",How to Catch a Catfish1," The size of the rod you buy should be determined by the size of the fish available to catch in your region.


For fish under 20 pounds, use a six-foot rod with at least a 10-pound test line.
For fish over 20 pounds, use a seven-foot rod with at least a 20-pound test line.

Longer rods are better for fishing from banks, as opposed to a boat, since they offer greater reach.

;
, Most sporting good stores sell starter tackle boxes that include a range of supplies to get you started. When it comes down to it, all you really need are sharp fishhooks, but some of the other accessories are nice to have.


Glow-in-the-dark bobbers can come in handy when you're fishing at night.
Other types of bobbers can be helpful when you're fishing on a still pond.
You'll also need buckets and coolers to hold your bait and any catfish you'll be bringing home.

, Some catfish enthusiasts swear by a specific type of bait, but the truth is that catfish will eat many different things. For your first few catfish expeditions, take a few different types of bait, so you can find out what the catfish in your region like to eat. Try some of these options:


Try cut bait. Shad, herring, goldeye, and other baitfish release oils that attract catfish. Slices of these fish are particularly effective for catching channel catfish, which are the most common type of catfish in North America.

You can also use live baitfish that haven't been cut. These won't release oil as readily, but they may be more appealing to catfish since they're alive. Experiment to see which one is better.


Try crawfish. Catfish in southern regions might eat crawfish, which is available at your local bait shop.
Try nightcrawlers, which you can also buy at the bait shop. These worms are appealing to many types of fish..
If you don't want to make a run to the bait shop, you can use chicken livers or pieces of corn.
Try an artificial bait. There are dozens of artificial catfish baits sold at sporting goods stores, many of which claim to have a magic ingredient for which catfish go wild. However, expert fishermen say that the best fish are caught with real, live bait.

, If you know you stand the chance of catching a 50-pound fish, you're going to need a large piece of bait. Smaller bait like nightcrawlers will get stolen off the hook.








, Catfish aren't going to eat fish pieces that have been sitting out, so you'll need to store them in a bait cooler to keep them cold during the hours you'll be spending on the water.


Keep nightcrawlers in a container inside a cooler.
Keep cut baitfish on ice.
Keep live baitfish in a bucket of cool water.

, Every race will require a waiver. Keep in mind this is a dangerous sport. In order to participate you must sign a waiver.

, Once you’ve picked the race that is right for you, your significant other, and family register and register as EARLY as possible. Many events sell out and prices increase the closer it gets to the event.

, Although in most events you can bypass an obstacle and if you walk no one really cares, it is still in your best interest to train in order to prevent injury. Practice running on local trails to get the stabilizer muscles in your ankles, legs, and hips toned up to prevent sprains and to help you get a feel for how to place your feet when trail running. A little practice will make the event more fun!

Fish during the pre-spawn.,
Use a map.,
Start at the right time of day.,
Fish near areas of cover.",How to Catch a Bass2," The best time of year for bass is the pre-spawn.This is the time of year when the fish are waking up from winter inactivity to start the mating cycle. It begins with the water temperature starts to rise to 55 or 60 degrees and the females and males start to come up in the waters and interact with one another. Since they have been mostly dormant during the colder months, they are really aggressive and angry this time of year. This time period falls around early spring and lasts the whole season.


During this time, you can catch bass closer to the shore and closer to the surface.
You can bass in any season, but they are really active during the spring months.
If you catch a female during this period, make sure you let her go so she can nest and populate the body of water with more bass., Find a map of the body of water where you plan to fish. The maps will show you the depths of the different areas of the water and any drop offs under the surface of the water. Bass like the lurk near the bottom in non-peak seasons, so having a map of the depths of the body of water you are fishing in can help you find the bass. It can also help you find underwater structures where the bass might like to hide.


Most bodies of water have a map available online from either the state or local natural resources website., The best times of day to catch a bass are the early hours of the morning and the last hours of the day. Try to get to your fishing spot about an hour before sunrise or an hour before sunset because the bass bite more at these times when the sun isn't too high overhead. If you happen to fish during the middle of the day, look for the bass in shaded areas away from direct sunlight. They avoid areas of extreme light and heat.


You can get bass to bite in the afternoon in open water if it is cloudy or if the water is muddy enough to shield the sun., Bass like to be near objects, vegetation, or obstructions in the water, such as a stump or tree that has fallen into the water. It can be near boat docks or bridge posts. Cast around low hanging tree limbs and in large patches of weeds as well because bass like the constant cover provided by these places in the water.


Be careful when you cast around these kinds of objects since you might get your lures or hooks stuck on them. If you do, you could lose your lure or have to re-hook your line. The risk is worth it because sizable bass are in these areas."
"
Catch bass with crank bait.,
Nab bass with spinner bait.,
Get bass with plastic worms.,
Hook bass with live bait.",How to Catch a Bass3," Crank bait attract bass because the lures look like injured, weak fish in the water, which causes the bass to strike. To use the crank bait, put your lure on your line. Cast your pole out into the lake or river near a structure and let the lure sink to the bottom. Once you feel the line settle, pull back on your rod and start to reel in your line. As you pull back your rod, you will feel the lure dive into the water, which will cause resistance on your pole. Level out your pole again and stop reeling your line. This will allow your lure to rise in the water. Repeat until your lure reaches the surface. Then, cast out again and repeat.


Once you feel a bass tug on your lure, gently pull back on the pole. This will tug the hook into the bass's lip, which is called setting the hook. Once you do this, you can reel in your bass.
If you are fishing in a calm body of water such as a lake or pond, use steady, even pulls and reels with the bait. If the water is choppy or moving such as a river or on a windy day, switch back and forth between pulling and reeling fast and slow.
You can also try to make the movements seem as realistic as possible. You want to bass to think that the lure is a real fish., The method for using spinner bait is similar to the crank bait. The difference is that when you pull back your pole, you don't have to reel in your line. Pull it back to make it dive in the water, then slowly let your pole back down. This will make the lure move back up in the water, make the blades emit noise, and upset the water around the lure. The bright, spinning blades on these lures attract the attention of the bass and pulls the bass to your lure because the movement annoys them.


This method can be more difficult because it is harder to hook your fish because the bass often bite at the blades instead of the hook. This causes it to take more time to actually hook a bass., This lure is much simpler than the other lures to fish with. Put the plastic worm on your line, cast out your line, and let the worm sink to the bottom. Instead of pulling your rod around, you can simply reel your line back in at various speeds. Since real worms aren't jumpy, there is no need to jerk your reel like you did with the other lures.


You should put a weight into your worm so it sinks to the bottom once you cast it. Otherwise, it will stay too close to the top of the water and not attract the bass., The best technique for live bait is to constantly move around your line. The bait you put on your hook is dead or mostly dead, but bass are extremely attracted to live prey. To mimic the live fish, worm, or frog, you should constantly move around your line. This can be through reeling it in or slightly moving your pole back and forth to make it look like the bait is moving around naturally."

Use a pole or a rod and reel.,
Buy a collection of jigs.,
Use minnows as bait.",How to Catch a Crappie2," The simple, old-fashioned pole is used by most crappie fishermen, and it's quite effective. You can use an inexpensive cane pole or a fiber or graphite pole. Lightweight poles are usually best when you're fishing for crappie. If you'd rather use a rod and reel, that's fine, too.

, Jigs by far the most popular lures used to catch crappie. Don't rely on just one, though; the elusive crappie is picky, so you'll need an array of jigs to try on any given fishing expedition. They come in different weights, shapes, and sizes. Crappie generally bite on smaller jigs.


Jigs are covered with synthetic soft bodies that are made with many different types of materials and come in all kinds of colors and textures.
Some soft bodies are made to look like a particular type of bait.

, If you'd prefer not to use a synthetic soft body, use minnows as bait. Crappie are attracted to minnows, so this is the most popular type of real bait used to fish them.

Fish deep in the winter.,
Move to shallow waters in the spring.,
Move to more deeper waters in the summer.,
Fish in clear water.,
Ask other fishermen what's working for them.",How to Catch a Crappie3," When the temperature is low, crappie hang out in deeper waters. Since many fisherman pack up the tacklebox when it's cold outside, winter fishing can be a great time to catch the biggest crappie of the year. Be patient and spend time toward the center of the lake, where the water is deepest.


When it's windy and cold outside, don't hang out near the banks or in areas where the wind is broken. It may be more comfortable there, but you're more likely to catch fish if you venture into deeper waters.Crappy are more sluggish during the winter, and slower to bite, so you'll have to spend more time out there before you catch one.

, When crappie spawn in the spring, they're quite easy to catch in shallow waters. Fish near brush piles and wood structures that are closer to shore.Look for areas where streams meet the lake, since this is where female crappie enter the lake to lay their eggs.Springtime floods often lead to better crappie fishing, since the congregate around other fish that are spawning. Springtime is considered by many anglers as the best time of year to catch crappie, followed by fall, summer and lastly winter., To escape the summer heat crappie move to deeper and cooler water at about 8 to 25 feet. It can be hard to locate them in the summer and a fish finder helps significantly. However, good ole trial and error is another good method. Once you figure out at what depth they're at, anchor down and start catching some crappie., When the water is muddy, it can be hard for crappy to see the lure. Crappie find their food by sight, not smell, so they may never bite if the water is too muddy. Look for a place where it's clearer and use a big, bright lure., Crappie in different areas have different habits. They may be attracted to a certain type of jig color, or they may be biting a certain type of bait you're not using. Before you head out in your boat, go to the tackle shop and ask other people what's working for them that day. Chances are, it'll work for you, too. "

Start fishing in the spring.,
Go early in the morning.,
Look for spots with cover.,
Take your position.",How to Catch a Catfish2," Catfish are less active when the water is cold, so the best time to start fishing is when water levels rise and the water warms to about fifty degrees in the spring. You can continue fishing until it gets cold again.









Experiment to find the best time of year to go catfishing in your region. In some places the season may start earlier, and in other places the water doesn't warm up until early summer.
Blue catfish, which live in the Southern United States, are active all winter long, so you don't have to pause during the colder months if you're fishing in that region.

, Catfish are more active very early in the morning, so plan to start your fishing expedition before sunrise, or even earlier. They tend to feed during these hours.


Fishing at night can also yield a large catch. If you like to stay up all night on the water, try fishing starting around one or two in the morning.
You might find some catfish later in the day if it's overcast or raining, but if there's full sun, the fish are likely to be less active.

, Catfish like to dwell in places where a current meets a still area, so they can rest without fighting the current. ""Covered"" areas can be found where the current hits a large log or rock, usually near the bank of a river. Other resting places might be found near dams or other man-made structures in the water.


In smaller rivers and streams, look for eddies created by rocks and fallen logs toward the middle of the water.
If you're fishing in a pond or reservoir, look for areas near feeder creeks, very deep spots, and fallen logs and boulders.

, Once you've chosen the spot where you want to start fishing, drop your anchor, set up your equipment, cast your line and wait for a bite.

Reel it in.,
Examine the fish's size.",How to Catch a Catfish3," When a catfish bites, let the line go a bit slack and then start reeling it in, quickly. Read How to Reel in a Large Fish to learn proper reeling techniques.








, Make sure the fish meets the size requirements for keeping fish in your region.


If the fish is too small, you will have to unhook it and set it free.
If you plan to keep the fish, place it in a bucket of water so that you can clean and skin it later.

Load your fly rod.,
Grip the rod like you are shaking someone’s hand.,
Start your back cast.,
Pause when your fly line fully leaves the surface.,
Finish with your forward cast.,
Stop your hand abruptly with the tip of the fly rod still slightly pointing upward.",How to Cast a Fly Fishing Rod1," Fly rods are much more flexible than spinning rods. Your fly rod will not cast properly if you do not feel the rod bend and unbend in your hand. This is called “feeling the rod load” and can sometimes be a difficult concept for beginners to grasp. Another way to think of the “load” on your fly rod is as the amount of potential energy “loaded” into the flex of the rod and weight of the fly line.


Let some line out of your fly rod. Fly line is thicker and heavier than monofilament line, but it features a plastic sheathing to make it buoyant.As you let more line out of the rod, you add more load. The process is very similar to the length of a whip determining its potential energy load.
When done correctly, the torque of your cast combined with the flex in the fly rod will sail the heavier fly line out, carrying the fly with it. This means that your rod will not load if you do not let out the right amount of line.
The amount of line to let out will depend on the length of your rod and other factors such as weight. Consult your rod's manufacturer or an expert to find the perfect amount of line to let out for your specific setup. However, a good rule of thumb is to let out line equaling approximately three lengths of your rod.;
, Your thumb should be on top with four fingers wrapped around the rod. Do not grip too tightly. The casting motion requires fluid movement, so a firm but relaxed grip, the same as you would grip a golf club, is ideal.


Keeping the butt of the fly rod under your wrist and in line with your forearm helps you maintain a straight plane while casting as well., Begin with your fly line in front of you and cast it back. Anglers may have a personal preference between a sidearm, 45 degree, or overhead cast. Each is useful in its own situation, but start with the casting angle most comfortable to you while learning.Keep your wrist stiff and your elbow close to your side. The most important part of the backward and forward casting movements is that each is in a straight line.
Pull your fly rod back to a 10 o'clock position. Only bend your elbow.

, Once you see the line leave the surface, pause at the apex of your back-casting movement. This allows the momentum of that movement to travel all the way down the line.


Your amount of line and rod load will determine the exact amount of time you need to pause before beginning your forward cast. The ideal amount of time to wait is for the fly line to unfurl behind you almost entirely so that the leader is nearly extended at full the moment you begin your forward cast., Start your motion forward smoothly in a straight line toward your desired spot on the water surface. The movement should be relaxed but swift. Once again, you are transferring energy from the movement into the line.


As with your back cast, the most important aspect is making sure that you cast forward in a straight line, otherwise the fly line will wander and take your fly with it.

, The line will continue to transfer momentum from your movement, but keeping the rod tip upright will help the line carry out to its complete distance rather than falling short.


You will feel the rod “unload,” but again, do not bend your wrist.
As you see the line in flight, slightly turn your thumb down around 1” or 2.5cm.
Keep your hand where it is and let the line fly out of the rod.

Purchase a crab pot.,
Acquire bait.,
Be sure to have a 15 foot (4.6 m) length of cord and a buoy.,
Bait the crab pot with a single bunker.,
Set your trap.,
When first testing an area you may want to check the pot in 20 - 30 minutes to see if there are crabs in the area.

,
Notice that the best areas for crabs are where the water is moving.,
When you get to your crabbing spot, tie one end of a 5–6 foot (1.5–1.8 m) line on to your stick.,
Tie a piece of your bait securely at the other end of your line.

,
Drop your bait into the water holding securely onto your stick.

,
Wait for the tug of the crab eating your bait.

,
When you feel a nibble, slowly raise the line to the surface.,
Either drop the crab into your bucket or use your net to grab your prey and then drop it in the bucket from the net.

,
Crabs should not be without water or air for too long.",How to Catch a Blue Claw Crab," Check local state laws for specific details. Some states needed for them to be turtle proof, other states require an exit hole for undersized crabs. Some say that a small cake pan is more efficient.

, The best bait is Bunker, a fish that can be purchased at any bait and tackle shop along the coastal areas. Chicken parts are a good second.

, You can get cord anywhere and a buoy can be purchased at a bait and tackle shop or convert a fairly large cleaning solution jug.

, Cutting the fish in half can increase the smell in the water.

, You can go in any salt water bay area from the shore or off a dock and drop the crab pot in the water. Crab pots are repeating traps so they can be checked periodically throughout the day or left to sit for 24 hours.

,, Often the head of a lagoon or inlet does not have a flow and crabs to not enter the area.

,;
,,,, Go slowly and try not to scare the crab. Gently reel in your line wrapping it around your stick until the crab is hanging in the air.

,, Crabs can live in coolers with ice because the ice slows down their system. Never cook and eat a dead crab. Eat your crabs the same day that you catch them.

, A spincasting rod is designed with a recessed seat and curved projection for you to wrap your index finger around.


Most fishermen cast spincasting gear with the same hand they reel the line in with. If you hold the rod grip behind the reel when you reel in, you'll need to change hands when you cast.

, You may want to angle your body slightly, with the side of your body opposite the hand in which you hold your rod more toward the target area.

, Turning the rod lets you flick your wrist when you cast, so you can cast more naturally and powerfully. Casting with the reel held upright makes you cast more stiffly and robs you of power. If you cast with your opposite hand, the reel handles should point down instead of up.

, The line may drop slightly, but it will stay in place. If the line drops too far, you didn't hold the button firmly enough. Reel the line up and try again.

, As you do, raise your rod until its tip goes slightly past vertical.

, This is about 30 degrees above horizontal, or the ""10 o'clock"" position.

, Your bait or lure should be propelled forward toward the target area. If it hits the water in front of you, you released the button too late. If it flies upward, you release the button too soon.

, This will brake the flight of your bait, ""feathering"" it down to land where you want it to.

Baitcasting rods are designed the same as spincasting rods, and as with spincasting rods, most fishermen cast with the same hand they retrieve with, so if you prefer to hold the rod behind the reel when you retrieve, you'll need to switch hands when you cast.You may want to rest your thumb at a slight angle on the spool instead of pressing the very flat of it on the line. This will give you more control over the flow of the line during the cast., As with spincasting gear, this lets you use your wrist when you cast. If you cast with your opposite hand, the handles should point down.

, Baitcasting reels made since the 1970s have a mechanism to disengage the reel spool from the handles so they don't turn during the cast, allowing for longer casts. The first such models had the button on the side of the reel; most models today feature a release bar behind the spool that you press with your thumb when you rest it on the reel spool.







, You need to bend your casting arm at the elbow so that the crook of your arm begins to approach a right angle. As you do, raise your rod until its tip goes slightly past vertical. This will give you the correct positioning to send the line out.

, This is about 30 degrees above horizontal, or the ""10 o'clock"" position. As you do so, lift your thumb off the reel spool enough so that the weight of your bait or lure pulls line off the spool as it is propelled toward the target.If you are casting with a long-handled baitcasting rod of the kind used in saltwater fishing, you'll want to use your opposite hand as a fulcrum from which to pivot the rod as you cast.

, This is similar to pressing the button on a spincasting reel to brake the line; however, not applying your thumb soon enough leads to the spool continuing to turn after your bait hits the water, creating an overrun or ""birds nest"" that you'll have to straighten out before you can retrieve your lure., Newer models have several features, like the cast control break and friction cast control, that might be lacking in older models.But the most important thing when choosing a baitcasting reel is to pick one that feels good in your hand and fits your fishing needs. Go to a store that sells baitcasting reels and hold a few. Or, if you prefer the older models, try finding one at an antique shop., Baitcasting tackle is not suited for casting baits or lures weighing a quarter ounce or less. If you like to take several rods with you when you fish, carry a rod with a spincasting reel for the lighter weight lures and a rod with a baitcasting reel for the heavier lures., Fishing waders can offer protection from the cold water you’re fishing in, from accidentally snagging your skin with a bad cast (especially while you’re learning), or from various cuts and bruises if you accidentally take a tumble., Practice your casting techniques away from the water as well as on it. Away from the water, replace your bait or lure with a rubber practice plug or metal sinker. Practice in an open area, away from overhead trees., When you are choosing an area to cast in, pick a place that has minimal brush, especially overhead. Your bait can get easily caught in the branches and this will cost you much precious time to retrieve., It can be dangerous to try baitcasting in a place where too many people are around. You have to constantly make sure no one is behind you or too close to you in order to make sure you don’t accidentally snag them with your lure. And being hyper aware of your surroundings takes away some of the relaxing joy of baitcasting anyways."

Unlike spincasting or baitcasting reels, spinning reels are designed to be reeled with the hand opposite the one used to cast with. As most fishermen cast right-handed, most spinning reels have the handle on the left.
Spinning rods are also slightly longer on average than spincasting rods, without a recessed seat and with the guide nearest the reel seat somewhat larger than the other rod guides to permit the line to flow more freely when you cast.;
, If you have a sinker or bobber attached to the line, it should be 6 to 12 inches from the rod tip instead.

,, The bail is a loop of wire on the rotating rim outside and behind the reel spool. It gathers the line when you reel in and deposits it on the spool. Opening it moves it out of the way of the line so you can cast your lure.

,, To help you target your bait to the casting area, point your index finger at the place you want to release the line. You may find this technique difficult at first.


If you are casting with a long-handled spinning rod of the kind used in saltwater fishing, you'll want to use your reeling hand as a fulcrum from which to pivot the rod as you cast.
Some fishermen use closed-faced spinning reels (also called underspin or triggerspin reels), in which the reel spool is covered similar to a spincasting reel. On these reels, a trigger above the reel works similar to the button on a conventional spincasting reel. Grip the line in your index finger and hold it against the trigger as you pull the trigger back. The rest of the casting technique is otherwise the same as using an open-faced spinning reel.

Use the roll cast when there is no room behind you for a back cast.,
Hold the rod out in front of you.,
Bring the rod tip back so that a small segment of line hangs loosely behind your casting shoulder.,
Move the rod in a forward-cast movement.,
Stop when the rod tip is still pointing slightly upward.",How to Cast a Fly Fishing Rod2," In some situations, trees, brush, or anything else that makes it difficult to extend a back cast may limit the movement of your cast. These situations call for a roll cast.A roll cast keeps the line, and therefore the fly, closer to your body, so a hat and sunglasses are recommended while practicing this casting maneuver.

, Use the same relaxed but firm, thumb-forward grip described in the forward-cast method. You should also ensure that there are no tangles down the line.

, The majority of your fly line will still remain in front of you in this position, most likely stretched out across the water.


This isn’t a rapid movement, simply the position you want to be in when you actually begin the roll cast.

, This movement should start gradually and gain speed. The slow initial movement will help you maintain control of the cast, which should be in a straight line.


Instead of unfurling behind you like in a back cast, the fly line will roll out in front of you as the tippet and fly catch up with the forward momentum of the cast.

, Stopping with the rod tip in an upward position gives the fly line more height and room to roll out in front of you.


Casting the rod tip too far forward will sink the rolling line too low, possibly allowing it to contact the ground or water before unfurling.

Select lures designed for the fish you most often pursue.,
Build a comprehensive array of lures.,
Talk to local fishermen.",How to Buy Fishing Lures," Bass is perhaps the most popular freshwater game fish in North America. They're indiscriminate eaters, making them susceptible to a wide range of artificial baits. But certain lures, when presented properly at appropriate depths at specific times of the year, have demonstrated success with bass over generations. At least 1 of each type should be in your tackle box every time you fish.


Plastic worms: Bass fishermen generally agree that the plastic worm is the top soft bait in their tackle box. Plastic worms can be virtually any color, and range in size from 3 inches (7.6 cm) to 10 inches (25.4 cm). While their consistency in landing fish is undeniable, their effectiveness is limited to certain circumstances. They shouldn't be used in deep water or in water colder than 60 degrees (16 degrees Celsius), or when bass are most active.
Jigs: Jigs are difficult lures to use because they are fished along lake and river bottoms, making them susceptible to getting caught up on underwater obstacles. They also require a slow, flipping retrieve that replicates the movement of crawfish. Buy a light-colored jig for use on sunny days and a dark one for stained water. Prefer jigs slightly less than a half-ounce.
Crankbaits: These lures are perhaps the most versatile when pursuing largemouth bass. Crankbaits can be fished at any depth, but because their effectiveness depends largely on their action, they're best when used by advanced anglers. Cranks are cast-and-retrieve lures, enabling the angler to fish large areas quickly. A crankbait is a good choice for the first few casts of the day.
Spinnerbaits: The safety-pin design of spinnerbaits keeps them from getting hung up on the heavy �over areas where bass lurk. ""Silent"" lures, spinnerbaits are effective in catching large fish that aren't easily stirred. Be sure to have a spinnerbait that resembles baitfish for shallow water. Brightly colored lures do better in deep, cloudy water.
Poppers: Lures that run or pop on the surface of the water can be effective when targeting bass. Color is important when choosing poppers and chuggers. Use colors that will stand out against the sky, making it easier for the surfacing fish to attack the bait.;
, A variety of factors can affect the behavior of fish, so anglers must be able to adapt to increase their strike rate. Many times, a subtle change in bait can turn an unsuccessful day of fishing into one with a lot of strikes. For example,replacing a fluorescent spinnerbait with a subdued tone can sometimes improve results, particularly in clear, shallow water. When choosing a lure, consider the following qualities:


Color: Brighter colors (e.g., fluorescent spinnerbaits and purple, watermelon and red flake soft worms) are preferred in stained water. Select natural, translucent complements for shallower water.
Cover: Perhaps the most crucial factor in bass fishing is selecting lures that perform best around cover. Bass linger in grasses, submerged cover like stumps, and natural drop-offs along lake and river bottoms. When deciding to fish dense cover, be sure to choose a lure that is natural prey in that area. Crankbaits are best avoided in these situations.
Size and weight: Generally, larger lures are better in murky water. Heavier lures are ideal for deeper water and along firm structures. Crankbaits, in particular, can land big bass when they're fished properly. These heavy lures are often hit soon after they bump off obstacles.
Action: Bass are sight feeders. In clear water, tailed plastic worms are attention-getters. This type will complement your more lifelike plastic worms. Surface lures that produce a wake attract the attention of bass, too. In general, work spinnerbaits and crankbaits slowly when fish are lethargic; faster and more naturally when bass seem aggressive.

,


Make a visit to your local bait shop part of your routine on days you fish. They'll be able to tell you which fish have been actively recently and what type of lures are producing the best results.
Bring some cash in case you don't have the lure that's hitting already in your tackle box. Top fishermen adapt to the habits of the fish they're trying to catch; they don't force their will on their quarry.

Before casting, you want to adjust the drag and tension so that line will peel off the reel smoothly as you cast.


Set the braking system to zero. If you don’t know how to do this, an expert at a fishing tackle store can show you how on a demonstration reel.
With a practice weight on the line and the rod pointing at 10 to 11 o’clock, press the reel spool release button while keeping your thumb on the spool. The weight should remain in place.
Jiggle the rod tip. The weight should fall slowly and smoothly. If not, adjust the tension until it does.

(The reel’s braking system is designed to help prevent this, but you must still apply your thumb to bring the reel to a stop.)


Casting baitcasting tackle is very similar to casting spincasting tackle. Baitcasting tackle offers more precise control than spincasting tackle, because your thumb rests directly on the line when braking. However, baitcasting reels are not designed to handle lines as light as spincasting or spinning reels are. You should use lines no lighter than 10 pound test (5 kg class) with baitcasting tackle, and thicker lines such as 14 to 17 pound test (7 to 8 kg class) handle even better.Likewise, baitcasting tackle is best suited for casting baits or lures weighing 3/8 ounce or more, while spincasting tackle is best suited for lures weighting 1/4 ounce or less.If you like to take several rods with you when you fish, carry a rod with a spincasting reel for the lighter weight lures and a rod with a baitcasting reel for the heavier lures.

"
"
Strip off about 20 feet (6 meters) of line from the tip of the rod and lay it in front of you.,
Pinch the line ahead of the reel against the rod handle with your index and middle fingers.,
Raise the rod to the 10 o’clock position.

,
Lift the rod tip quickly, flipping the line behind you.,
Hold the rod upright just long enough to let the line straighten out behind you.,
Sweep the rod forward while pulling your elbow downward.,
Stop the forward stroke with a snap of your wrist when the rod returns to the 10 o’clock position.,
Repeat the backstroke and sweep as necessary to pay out additional line for more distance.,
Lower the rod tip as the line straightens out to lay the line, leader and fly on the water.",How to Cast4," While in the other forms of casting, you’re casting a bait or lure, in fly fishing, you cast the line in a manner similar to cracking a whip with a weighted tip.

, You should hold the rod straight in front of you as you do this, reel down, with your thumb resting along the top of the rod handle.

,, Keep your upper arm at your side, but raise it to a 30-degree angle. Stop raising the rod when your thumb points straight up; your forearm should also point straight up at this point.


You should do this quickly enough so the line’s weight and movement bend the rod.
To make the line move faster, pull downward on it above the reel with your other hand as you lift the rod tip.

, At first, you may want to look behind you to watch the line straighten out,but you can eventually feel a slight tug as the line straightens.

, This will make the rod move faster, giving your forward stroke more power.


You can make the line move faster still by pulling downward on it with your other hand.

, Your thumbnail should be even with your eye at this point; the snap should be sharp enough that you can feel the rod tip whip forward.

, Unlike the other forms of casting, you can add distance to how far your line travels with repeated back and forward strokes.

,


If you find using a fly rod too difficult, you can also cast flies using ultralight spinning gear and water-weighted bobbers. Use the casting techniques described in “How to Cast with Spinning Gear.”

Determine the primary use of your fishing rod.,
Choose a reel.,
Choose a rod material.,
Set your budget.,
Seek out product and user reviews on fishing rods that interest you.,
Track down neighboring stores that sell fishing rods.",How to Buy a Fishing Rod1," Before you embark on your search for the perfect fishing rod, you’ll need to identify what you plan to do with it. Here are some of the factors worth considering:



Casual angler or fishing enthusiast? The amount of fishing you plan to do will have a significant impact on your choice. If you’re just looking for something you’ll use once or twice a year, it would be prudent to select a simple rod that won’t cost a lot of money and is easy to use. Someone planning a more hard-core fishing schedule should consider a more durable, higher-quality option.

Smallmouth bass or Chinook salmon? The size of the catch will also make a big difference in the rod you choose. If you’re looking to snag some bass, trout, or other reasonably sized fish, you’ll likely favor a lighter rod and thinner fishing line. Bigger catches like salmon require stronger rods and line. And if you’re after the biggest game, you will need a top-end rod and a long, strong fishing line.

Child or adult? The size of the rod will depend largely on who it is for. If you’re looking for a fishing rod suitable for a child, you’ll be seeking a shorter, lighter rod than the type an adult would use. Rods come in a wide assortment of sizes, making it easy to find one suited to whoever will be using it.

Dockside or ocean? Where you plan to fish is one of the most important factors to consider. Angling off a dock shouldn’t require anything fancy, but open ocean fishing may need heavier tackle or special jigs, depending on your quarry. Consider your target and the conditions in which you’ll be fishing - calm waters, raging seas or anything in between—and choose accordingly.;
, The majority of anglers, from beginners to pros, use one of two different reels:


The spinning reel is generally the easier of the two reels to cast and is ideal for those who are new to the sport. The spinning reel uses a lighter line, making it the preferred option when fishing for smaller game in open-water situations. Larger fish can create problems for those using a spinner reel, and the thinner line tends to tangle more easily than a heavier line would.
The baitcast reel is the favored choice among bass fishermen and those who seek bigger catches. Baitcast reels support a thicker fishing line, allowing anglers to better navigate “cover” (the term used to describe any area with weeds, rocks, or other impediments where fish like to hide). Baitcast reels are harder to cast, however, and can be an exercise in frustration for those who aren’t familiar with how they work.

, Most new rods come in two materials:



Graphite rods are ideal for the majority of anglers. These rods offer plenty of give but won’t break even if you hook a really large fish. For standard fishing excursions, a graphite rod will do the trick.

Composite rods are a combination of graphite and fiberglass, providing much of the flexibility you get with a straight graphite rod but with added durability. These rods are better for those who are interested in “crankbaiting” (using heavy flat lures that run along jagged surfaces without snagging).

, Decide what you’re willing to spend and stick to it. This will help narrow down your choices further when it comes time to choose a rod.

, User reviews are a good way to get a rough consensus on the quality of a fishing rod. Fishing websites and other online resources will also conduct product reviews on new items; these reviews are often archived and can be tracked down using a simple search.

, A quick Internet search should display all of the best available options. A fishing-specific store or outdoor sporting goods establishment will have the largest selection of fishing rods, while department stores usually have outdoor sports sections that carry a smaller cache of equipment but will offer more in the way of discount options.

Consider your age.,
Follow residency guidelines.,
Determine if fishing is medical therapy.,
Decide between a one day or year round license.,
Buy a license online.,
Complete your online purchase.,
Purchase your license at a gun, fishing, or sporting goods store.,
Visit a Texas Parks and Wildlife Department location.",How to Buy a Fishing License in Texas," You don’t need a fishing license in Texas if you are fishing in waters that are completely enclosed by a state park. Figure out where you plan on fishing and if the waters fall within state park lines before wasting time and money on a fishing license. Also, determine if you are fishing saltwater or freshwater. Obtaining a license to fish for saltwater fish is more expensive than getting a license for freshwater.The freshwater year round package costs $30 for residents and $58 for nonresidents.
The saltwater year round package costs $35 for residents and $63 for nonresidents.
There are still bag and length limits within state parks.
Bag limits indicate the number of fish you can catch in a day and length indicates the length of the fish that you can catch.Refer to Texas Park and Wildlife’s website to find additional restrictions when fishing within state parks.;
, If you are 17 years old or younger, it’s not necessary in Texas that you get your fishing licence. Senior citizen fishing licences are available to Texans that are over 65 years old. The cost of senior citizen packages are far lower than of normal fishing licences. If you were born before 1931 don’t bother getting a fishing licence in Texas because it’s not required.You can get a senior freshwater fishing license for $12.
You can get a senior saltwater license for $17.
You can get a senior all-fish license for $22.If you are a minor, you should still be accompanied by an adult when fishing, especially in deeper waters.

, You need to figure out your residence status first because Texas has resident and nonresident licenses. To be considered a Texas resident, you need to live in Texas for at least one year and maintain a job. In addition, you need to be a U.S. citizen and be over the age of 18.If you don't meet the criteria, you'll have to obtain the nonresident licence.


Resident licences are significantly cheaper than nonresident ones., If you are being supervised by a family member or medical professional, then you can fish as therapy. This includes those with mental or physical disabilities.If you are fishing with a family member, then you’ll need a note from your doctor saying that this is therapy.
If you are fishing as therapy with a medical professional, you’ll need to carry a card that identifies the entity that is providing the therapy.

, Figure out how many days out of the year you’re fishing, and calculate whether it would be more expensive to get the yearly license, or get a license for the days you know you’re fishing. Year round packages include everything that you need to legally fish and bring home fish that you catch, but is far more expensive than purchasing the daily license. Purchase a yearly package if you know that you’ll be fishing a lot throughout the year.


One day licenses are much cheaper and cost $11 for residents and $16 for nonresidents.
The one day license includes all water fish.If you are active duty in the military, or a disabled veteran, you can get a Texas fishing license for free, as long as you’re a resident.
The all-water year round package costs $40 for residents and $68 for nonresidents.

Seek out a store employee.,
Pick up each fishing rod to see how it feels in your hands.,
Ask for recommendations.",How to Buy a Fishing Rod2," Rather than waste time mulling over your choice, go into the store with a list of concerns you want addressed and find an employee the moment you enter. Go through your list of queries, and follow up on anything else that may come up along the way.

, While you won’t be able to recreate actual fishing conditions in the store, you can get a good idea of whether the rod feels comfortable. The more rods you try out, the better the odds you’ll find one that feels “right.”

, If you still aren’t sure which one to choose, lean on the store staff for their picks. Employees often bring a wealth of experience that you can’t get from anywhere else. They will also know which rods are the most popular or can narrow down the choices depending on where you’re fishing and what you’re hoping to catch.

Make note of the name of the employee who assisted you.,
Pay for the item.,
Store the receipt in a safe place.",How to Buy a Fishing Rod3," Many fishing-centered stores and outdoor sporting goods establishments offer bonuses or commission when employees help customers with purchases. Ask the employee’s name and mention his or her helpfulness to the cashier. Even if no commission is awarded, it is a nice gesture.

, Retail outlets take cash, debit, or credit card. A few still take personal checks, but one of the first three options is favorable.

, The receipt will contain all details of the purchase, including the refund and exchange policy. Retain it in case you need to bring the fishing rod back for any number of reasons.

Select your arrival and departure dates.,
Make a to-do list.,
Plan to stay in big cities for at least three full days.",How to Backpack Through Europe1," Make sure to consider the season you want to travel in when you are selecting your dates. June through August is peak season, which means a lot of tourists and higher prices, but nice weather and many festivals. On the other hand, November through April is low season, which means cheaper prices and fewer tourists, but colder weather.If you plan to travel in the winter, keep in mind that you will need to pack more clothes.;
, Making a to-do list is the fun part. Make a list of all the places you want to see or visit. Then narrow down your list to the places you have to see, the places you really want to see, and the places you could do without.Use maps, travel books, and online travel sites to find out about exciting or popular events and destinations.

, Do this if you plan on visiting multiple cities. Three full days will give you enough time to see the sights without feeling rushed or burnt out. However, how long you stay in each city really depends on the length of your trip.For example, if you are traveling for two weeks and you want to visit four different cities, then two full days in each city is more practical.

Tell the world about your thru-hike.,
Start getting your gear together.,
Attend to the details.,
Exercise.,
Depart for your thru-hike.,
Immerse yourself in the experience.,

Follow a trail map and/or guide.,
Know the rules of the trail.,
Take a zero day.,
Enjoy your hike.",How to Thru‐Hike the Appalachian Trail," The most important factor in successfully completing an AT thru-hike is fully understanding what you are attempting to do. Read more than one firsthand account of those who have completed the journey in the past. Really consider if you could or would want to be in the conditions described. Think about your odds of being able to take 6 months off from work or other commitments. Decide what modern conveniences you are willing to give up, and whether or not the amount of money involved is feasible. This is a huge undertaking, and half a year is a long time.;
, Once you have decided to hike the AT and have picked a date, it is now up to you to hold yourself accountable for doing what you intend to. This is where the daydreaming gives way to action. Read Appalachian Trials, this is a must. Once you've made the decision, make a conscious decision not to second guess yourself, and get on your way.

, One thing to do would be to make a pro/con list with four columns. One: pros to completing your thru-hike; two: cons to completing your thru-hike; three: pros to not completing the hike; and four: cons to not completing the hike. These categories may seem very similar, but once you write you will notice that they approach the scenario each a little differently. Your pros to hiking and cons to not completing the hike should be your longest items on the list by far. Keep this and any other writing with you about why you are doing this with you before and on the trail. It will keep you motivated to continue.

, This can be one of the scariest parts of preparation for some people. You can be positive that not everyone will understand your desire and decision to take on this mission. For all intents and purposes, you look crazy. That's because you are. Let them know that. In whatever way you must, convince them that you are going and you will succeed. In fact, the more opposition you receive the better, in some cases, because you're going to want to prove the naysayers wrong. You may also consider starting a blog, signing up to raise money for a charity as you hike, or challenging critics to place bets on your likelihood of succeeding. All these will make it much harder to quit when the going gets tough.

, Depending on the amount of hiking and/or backpacking experience you may already have, this step could be easy and enjoyable or challenging and enjoyable. Either way, shopping for gear is one of a thru-hikers favorite preparatory experiences. Provided money isn't a serious concern, you get to spend a few months picking and choosing the right equipment, food, supplies, and gear for your journey. This is where more research is invaluable. The AT is a very specific trip that requires certain items different from anywhere else. It is impossible to experience it without doing it, so rely on as many successful thru-hikers' opinions as possible. But give yourself enough time to test and revise their theories. Each hiker is as unique as the gear they carry on their back.

, For lack of a better term, now is the time to put your affairs in order. This means making sure you have or will have the money set aside when you'll need it, determining how your bills will get paid when you are gone, that you have the appropriate leave of absence, and any other number of small, but crucial, tasks. This is a good time to figure out any mail drops you want to coordinate, how you are going to communicate with others, get to the trail, etc. Know how much food you should have on you at given time, and how often you will need to resupply.

, It is probably a good idea to get moving as much as possible before leaving. Take overnight trips and hike with your full backpack on. See if you are traveling too heavy or light. Try to find out how many miles you can comfortably walk (not on pavement) in a day or successive days. Do cardio to get your heart strong for those steep ascents up the mountains. If you need to exercise your mind, take up meditation or yoga. Mindfulness will help you enjoy and experience everything more while you are out there.

, If you are hiking northbound (the most common type of thru-hike) you will travel to the summit of Springer Mountain in Georgia to begin the hike. You can also travel south from Katahdin Mountain in Maine, begin at the halfway point of Harper's Ferry West Virginia, or jump on wherever you please. Just know that the season begins officially in March and the majority of attempting thru-hikers will set off from Springer then. #

, You'll find a very different lifestyle on the trail than anything you've probably seen before. Enjoy the novelty of sleeping outdoors, submitting scenic peaks, meeting other people on the trail, and living without constant connection to the outside world. Everything will seem very exciting and new, so have a blast.

, Every week or two on the trail you will reach an AT outfitter. This is the best time to replace any gear that isn't working out, send back what you don't need home, or lighten your pack any way you can.

, While on the trail the only markers you will find are white blazes that indicate which direction to go. You will need to know what distance you will have to cover to reach the next shelter or town. If you have mail drops, you should coordinate trips into town on days that the post office is open. Planning ahead is important at all stages of the hike.

, Although there are shelters fairly frequently on the trail, they are not always big enough to fit every hiker. You will end up camping in a separate area at times. You will have to know which parks you hike through require permits for camping. Some areas of the trail even provide hunting grounds, so it is a good idea to be aware. There are also more common sense, unwritten rules, such as not washing items too close to a water source, or burying human waste with a stick or trowel. Don't forget about learning proper safety precautions concerning wildlife on the trail and protection from getting your food eaten by a bear or contracting a disease from a tick or mosquito.

, You will not be able to continuously hike the trail every day, 15-25 miles (24-40 kilometers), day in and out without sustaining injury, unless you are some sort of a superhuman. You will need to take a day or two off at trail towns when you need to restock, sleep in a bed, and take a shower. These simple comforts will take on a world of significance when you are on the trail. Zero days (when you don't hike any miles on the trail) are essential to psychological and physical well being. You'll get a chance to communicate with loved ones and relax. Don't forget to be economical when it comes to town visits and zero days, though. They are enjoyable, but costly, and best savored when you really need them.

, This will be a unique experience that you will never forget. Attempting a thru-hike is good, completing a thru-hike is better, and doing so while enjoying it is the best. The trail will make you more miserable than you can imagine, yet more alive and happy than you think is possible. It is a journey of deprivation, pain, and burden, but also a life changing accomplishment. If you can hike the AT, you can do anything at all. No journey will be too large for you to undertake. And you will emerge with a new understanding of yourself, nature, and society. Enjoy all of it, not just the end and beginning.

Check out hostels.,
Couchsurf.,
Try camping.,
House sit.,
Try a vacation apartment rental.,
Stay at a hotel.",How to Backpack Through Europe2," If you are planning on a budget, then hostels are a great choice. On average, a hostel will cost anywhere from 18 to 40 euros/night. The farther you go east, the cheaper the prices are. Many hostels offer free WiFi, clean linens, and breakfast. However, not all of them do. Make sure to check the amenities each hostel offers before booking.Additionally, because some hostels have lower and upper age limits, check out the hostel's age limit before you book your stay.
The cost of a hostel will typically depend on the popularity of the hostel and the size of your room; for example, a private room in a Parisian hostel will cost more than a shared room in a Croatian hostel.

, Couchsurfing is another affordable way to travel around Europe since it is free most of the time. It is also a great way to meet locals and find out about local events and activities. Visit a site like couchsurfing.com. You can browse the available couches in the area you will be staying in.There is a large network of couchsurfers in Europe, so it is a relatively safe and affordable way to backpack through Europe on a budget.

, Camping is another affordable option. However, you will need to pack or buy a tent and basic camping supplies if you want to try this option. The average cost of a tented space at a campsite ranges from 9 to 15 euros. Alternatively, you can try a camping service. Sign up for the service, find a host, and pitch your tent in their backyard for a flat fee of 4 to 10 euros. Some hosts may even offer amenities, like a shower, during your stay. Look for these services at sites like campinmygarden.com, gamping.com, and airbnb.com.

, House sitting is a great option if you are staying in a city for a week or two. You will be able to stay at a local’s residence for free in exchange for maintaining and watching their house. Sign up for a service, find a house, and contact the owner. Make sure to read over the agreement and sign any documents before booking.Look for these services at sites like mindmyhouse.com, housecarers.com, and luxuryhousesitting.com.

, Vacation apartment rentals are pricier than hostels and couchsurfing, but they are still affordable. By staying in a vacation apartment rental, you will definitely have more space and privacy. Sign up for a service, find a rental, and book it. It is that simple.Look for vacation apartment rentals at homeaway.com, airbnb.com, vrbo.com, and flipkey.com.

, Staying at hotels is the most expensive option, but it is a great option if you feel like being pampered for a night. Stay at a hotel for one or two nights throughout your trip.See if you have any points saved up on your credit cards. This is a great way to get some discounts on hotel stays.

Travel by bus.,
Get a rail pass.,
Fly to your locations.,
Rent a car.",How to Backpack Through Europe3," Traveling by bus is, by far, the cheapest option. You can travel by bus within cities, as well as to other cities. It is typically 2 euros or less to travel within a city by bus. Euroline is the main bus service in Europe and its network extends throughout the continent.The drawback is that it takes longer to travel from city to city by bus.

, Traveling by train is an affordable option if you plan to visit many cities. To get the best deals, purchase a Eurail pass ahead of time. For unlimited travel to any country within the Eurail system for 15 days to 3 months, get a Global Pass. Get a Flexi pass for 10 to 15 days of travel to any country within the system for a 2-month period.If your travel time to cities is less than six to eight hours, then this is the best option.

, Try flying to your locations if you are traveling for only a short period of time like two weeks. Budget airlines in Europe make this option very affordable. The cost of a flight can be as low as 5 euros. However, make sure to look at the fees and stipulations before booking. The flight may seem cheap, but fees can raise the price substantially.This is a good option if your travel time by train is eight or more hours.
Some discount airlines are Ryanair, Wizz, Easyjet, and Transavia.

, A car is a good option if you want to visit small towns in the countryside, but it is the most expensive option. You have to pay for gas, tolls, and parking. Additionally, many companies charge a drop-off fee of 100 to 300 euros if you drop the car off in a different destination."

Bring maps.",How to Backpack Through Europe5," Once you have everything planned out, calculate the cost and begin saving. It is probably best to start planning your trip six to eight months ahead of time. This way you can ensure that you will have enough money saved up for your trip., Make sure to do this if you do not have one. Make photocopies and electronic copies of your passport just in case you lose it. Also email yourself the photocopies. This way you can access them on a computer anywhere.Additionally, make sure to check your travel destination's tourism website to see if you need visas for your trip; for example, you may need a visa if you are traveling for an extended period of time, or if you are traveling from an EU country to a non-EU country.

, Do this once you have everything planned and the costs calculated. Try to purchase your plane tickets, accommodations, and train tickets (or rental car) a couple months in advance to get the best deals., Ask your bank about their exchange rates and fees. See if they have credit cards available that can help you get around some of these fees while you travel. Make sure to ask about any ATM withdrawal fees as well.Additionally, before you leave, make sure to let your bank know you will be traveling to avoid having your credit cards frozen.

, Ask your cellphone carrier about their international rates, as well as the type of international plans they have available. If you determine that the rates are too expensive, then look into getting a prepaid phone, like a tracphone., It is always a good idea bring a global map or maps of the countries you will be visiting. This way, if you cannot access the internet to activate your GPS, then you will have a back up.Try to purchase travel guide books that include maps of the countries you will be visiting.

Be prepared for the sheer size of Australia when travelling through it.,
Stay in backpacker hostels and other budget accommodation.,
Take care of yourself.,
Take care when hiking.,
Be sun aware.,
Enjoy.",How to Backpack in Australia," Australia is not like Europe or North America where a town pops up every few tens of miles/kilometres. Australia is vast and there are are a great many places that are nowhere near any other places. Most of the population centres hug the seaboard (especially the East). This means that you will need to consider where you want to backpack and how you will do it. Consider the following things:


Coastal backpacking is likely to be much easier than inland backpacking. Most Australians are coastal dwellers. Transport, infrastructure, towns and cities are found in much high density in coastal areas. If you want the easier experience, backpack Queensland down to Victoria; or you can divert across to Adelaide in South Australia, or catch the boat down to Tasmania. Tasmania is one neat package in and of itself for visiting, well worth considering.
Australia does not have a brilliant train system between many major towns and cities but there are some good passenger services depending on where you're headed. The major cities have train links but unlike Europe and Canada and some parts of the USA, the train system was allowed to run down over the years and more people relied on cars and buses than trains. That said, interested parties are trying to improve rail infrastructure across Australia and the more tourists prefer it, the better. Plan in advance and see what is available - again, coastal routes are likely to be better, and some famous routes such as The Ghan are always worth considering (for a price).
Buses in Australia are frequent and reliable and cost-effective. However, they are cramped when you consider that many of the journeys will take 10s and 20s of hours to get anywhere... Most come equipped with movies and other distractions for passengers such as stops for refreshments. Intrepid and strong backpackers won't mind the long rides but if you tire easily and don't sleep well sitting up, long bus rides around Australia are not desirable.

Hire a car. This is a fairly good option for a backpacker. Many young backpackers pool resources together to hire a car or even purchase a cheap one and travel together and cover the cost of fuel etc. Great for leaving the heavy backpacks in the trunk (boot) all the time! If you don't have a group to travel with, just check the noticeboards at backpacking hostels and you will likely find others looking to form such a group.

Cycling. It is possible to cycle Australia but restrict it to parts unless you are an endurance athlete. Some of the highways are dangerous for cyclists and many of the freeways ban cyclists.;
, There are plenty of both, including Formula 1 hotels, etc. The hostel network is good and pretty much everywhere. You will get a lot of information from these places about activities to share with others and about other places to visit. Contact the organizations for details on special deals etc.

, Australia is a relatively safe country to backpack in. Be aware though of a few things:



Hitchhiking is generally illegal or frowned upon. There have been some unfortunate cases of tourists not returning from a hitchhike in the middle of nowhere, and several high profile crimes have been committed involving unwitting backpackers, so do it at your own risk.
Ask locals about safety after dark. Some areas are typically unsafe due to drunken escapades, so avoid areas that have a lot of pubs and clubs, for example, in urban areas. Australian drinking habits are not pretty. Most places are fairly safe to go to after dark and women can usually travel alone, provided you take the proper and usual precautions.
Animal threats. Australian animals are gorgeous as a whole but some are a little unforgiving. There are venomous snakes, venomous spiders, crocodiles, jellyfish, stinging fish, blue ring octopuses, sharks etc. Read up on the hazards and be aware of how to avoid them. Even the apparently cute animals can bite (koalas, wombats) and kangaroos can kill with one swift kick if it is a large and aggressive male. However, common sense should prevail; Australians manage to live there safely on the whole, so ask the locals for tips and ""she'll be right"".
Drive carefully. Speaking of kangaroos, watch out for them on the roads. They are Australia's equivalent of moose or deer, depending on which species is hanging around. They do the same damage and can kill car occupants if hit too. Always be alert. They are generally dusk to dawn creatures but drought can drive them out into the day as well. Keep your eyes peeled all the time and try not to travel in kangaroo areas at night - get some good rest instead!
Drink driving. Australians like their ""booze"" and drink driving is a problem. There are many breathalyzers around to try to nab the drunk drivers but it pays to be alert to any erratic driving or speeding and give such drivers wide berth. Report them too if you can. Equally, don't drink and drive ""or you're a bloody idiot"" as Australians are fond of recounting.

, Many backpackers go hiking as much as discovering urban and regional areas. In Australia this presents some special challenges for consideration:



Avoid the dangerous animals. See the step above for an overview. In particular, consider your clothing. Sandals are not good hiking gear for the Australian bush. Wear covered boots and, if possible, long pants or gaiters. If you are attacked by a snake (the usual problem is not seeing one and treading on it), then the boots and gaiters/pants give protection. It is also very wise to be an alert hiker who looks ahead on the trail to see any sunbathing snakes. They're not waiting there to attack you; they're enjoying the sun. Glibly avoid them and make vibrations with heavy walking to warn them of your approach. And use insect repellent - flies and mosquitoes can be particularly annoying.

Sunburn. Australia is a scorching land with one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the world. Slip, slop, slap is the local vernacular, meaning slip on long-sleeved clothing, slop on sunscreen and slap on a hat. And keep out of the sun when it is fiercest between 11 and 3.
Water and dehydration. It is easy to die of thirst in Australia if you get lost in the middle of the desert and have no water. Always carry water, no matter how cool it might seem when you venture out and no matter how heavy that water feels carrying it. You will never regret having it and rarely will a hiker return from an Australian hike with a full water bottle.
Always know where you are going and take maps. Leave instructions at register booths if trails have them. And take warm clothing for mountain hikes. Not all of Australia has blistering heat and the cold can kill you on Australian mountains just as it can anywhere else in the world if you get caught in an unexpected storm. Also beware of flash flood zones; if it's raining, don't stand around or walk in what seem to be dry creeks, riverbeds, or drainage zones but keep well out of them and up higher. Never camp in creek or river beds. Flash floods can occur without warning, even during what might seem to be a drought.
Be careful wherever you hike. Sometimes Australia's weathered down rocks can be deceptive in their ""ease of climbing"" and people get careless and take silly risks. A fall from a rock can kill no matter how much smaller the rock seems than your rocks back home.

, As discussed in the step above, the sun is fierce over Australia. Always wear a hat, prefer long sleeved and long legged clothing if you are walking or travelling in the sun for any length of time and wear approved sunscreen. Avoid sunbathing for hours on end. You will be sun roasted and turn out as red as a lobster. Avoid being out in the sun between 11 and 3 during summer for any extended activity unless you have proper cover.

, Australia is a land of great and astounding beauty. You won't see landscape, vegetation or fauna like this anywhere else in the world. It is unique and that is what makes it precious. Respect it by sticking to trails and paths that have been made for human access and do not pick wildflowers or remove animals from their locations. Do not litter; Australians are very proud about having a clean country. Take lots of photos and pace yourself. Australia's enormity often requires several visits rather than trying to do too much at once and exhaust yourself in the process!

Place your hiking poles on a flat surface like a counter, so that you can easily read the measurements on the bottom half of the poles.,
Examine the way your poles can be adjusted.,
Unlock the top and bottom sections of the right pole by either twisting or opening the lever.,
Move the lower section of both the right and left poles to be right under the maximum length.

,
Take the right hand pole off the table or counter, wrap the hand strap around your hand and hold the pole so that your arm is at a 90 degree angle from your body.,
Twist to tighten the top section of the right pole or flip the lever closed.

,
Check the measurement of the upper section of the pole and adjust your left pole to be the same measurement.

,
Hold them next to each other to ensure they are the same height.

,
Place your hands through the wrist straps downward so that the strap is at the base of your hand supporting your wrist.,
Grab the pole around the sides, rather than on top.,
Adjust the upper portion of your hiking poles when hiking on hills.",How to Adjust Hiking Poles,"


Clean the poles, if they are dirty, so that they will continue to move smoothly as you adjust them.;
, There are 2 main options. The first, and perhaps most common option, is to twist the telescoping poles in 2 places. You would twist 1 way to loosen and move and the opposite way to tighten the poles into place. The second option is a small lever that you flick open with your thumb, move the pole and flick it closed when you have adjusted them.


Most hiking poles twist to the left to unlock, and to the right to lock. There should be arrows on 1 of the sections that show you which way to twist.

, Repeat with the left pole.


Although the poles look alike, most poles have a right and left hand pole where the grip is slightly different to adjust to your hands' shape and be more comfortable.

,, Relax your shoulders. This is a comfortable and correct position for pole use.

,,,, Adjust the wrist straps according to the manufacturer's directions, either by pulling the strap tighter or pulling up to loosen the strap. Your wrist is supported by the strap but can still apply pressure to the pole.

, Walk with your newly adjusted hiking poles.

, Shorten them by a few inches when going uphill. Lengthen them a few inches when going downhill. Aim to keep your arm and elbow at a 90 degree angle when going up or down hills.

It's good idea to make sure you enjoy hoofing around out in the woods before you find yourself out in the middle of a 14 mile loop in the wilderness.


Try a few hikes without any gear, but plenty of water, light snacks, a map of the area, and the right boots. Go out for a mile or two with some friends and have fun.
If you like that, try going on a longer hike, for several miles of somewhat rougher terrain. If you like that, take your bag with you and see how you enjoy it. Gradually build up to a series trip.;
, Are you interested in the mountains? The grasslands? The great lakes? Depending on where you live, the backcountry may be close by, or you may want to venture out farther for a serious hiking experience. In most areas, you shouldn’t need to travel more than a half a day by car to find a good National or State Park in which you can hike and camp.


Pick an appropriate time of year for that destination, as well. Some destinations are very crowded at certain times of year, or around holidays, while others are inappropriate for backpacking at certain times of the year. It'd be bad to head out to the desert in the middle of the summer if you're a first-timer.It's also usually good to avoid areas with bears during bear-heavy seasons, which will vary from region to region.

, Want to hike the Cumberland Gap? Explore Yosemite? Pitch a tent in the Grand Tetons? Once you’ve settled on a particular region of the country you’d like to explore, pick an area that’s appropriate for backcountry camping. Within the US, here are some of the best destinations for serious camping:


Yosemite National Park, CA
Joshua Tree, CA
Denali National Park, AK
White Mountain National Forest, NH
Olympic National Park, WA
Zion National Park, UT
Glacier National Park, MT
Big Bend National Park, TX

, Different wilderness areas and parks will have a variety of options available to backcountry hikers, so consult park maps of the area to find the specific trails, or find some online by checking out the National Parks website.Typically, long hikes come in three styles, which you can pick based on the difficulty, the type of terrain, and the sights that you may want to see at your destination. The three basic types of backcountry hikes include:


Loop hikes, which follow a long circle that will allow you to end up back where you started.
Out and back hikes, during which you'll hike to a specific destination and then retrace your steps backward.
End to end hikes usually require leaving a car at both ends, or arranging pick-up at your eventual destination. This is only typically done for very long hikes that go through multiple areas.

, While you might want to jump right in and do something difficult, you'll need to consider the terrain, weather, and the experience and conditioning of your group when planning how many miles you will travel each day. Most trails are rated for difficulty, so you'll usually want to stick with anything at a level 1 or 2 for your first several hikes. They'll be challenging enough.


Novices and weekend warriors should plan on hiking no more than 6–12 miles (9.7–19.3 km) per day of a given hike. In relatively tough terrain, that'll be more than enough.
Experienced hikers in good shape can sometimes do 10–25 miles (16–40 km) per day, depending on terrain, but it's usually best to not push it.

, If you’re camping on public land, there will typically be a small fee associated with coming into the park itself, and another fee associated with camping. They’re usually pretty small, and you can get away with no more than $15 dollars or so a night, depending on the season.


At most parks, you’ll have to display a permit on your car while you hike, and something on your tent, or bag, as well. The local regulations will be explained to you when you check in to the ranger’s office upon your arrival.
Most National Parks and other public lands will also have guidelines specific to their environments, at the time of year you’re camping. For example, Yosemite National Park requires the use of bear-proof canisters for food.

, Campfires are great, so long as they’re legal. Many areas prohibit fires during dry periods. At other times, they may only be allowed in specific locations, typically fire rings located at campsites. In some places a separate campfire permit is required to use a backcountry cooking stove.


Never, ever, leave a fire unattended. Do not light a fire unless you have enough water available to extinguish it thoroughly. As a precaution, clear a 15-foot (~5m) circular area around your fire, to prevent the wind from igniting any materials outside of your fire pit.

, Backpacking backpacks, or rucksacks, need to be sturdy enough to carry a significant amount of weight, but light enough so that you won't be in serious pain at the end of a long hike. Look for a bag with an internal frame, chest straps, and a waist-band to help secure the bag on your body properly.


Backpacking bags are sold at most sporting goods stores, and are matched to your body size and height. It's a good idea to go be fitted for one, to make sure it fits you properly.
Your backpack should have enough space for some food and water, a first aid kit, rain gear, sun gear, flashlight or headlamp and batteries, a tent and sleeping bag, even though you might not need all that for a group hike.

, Hiking isn't hiking without the proper footwear. If you're going to be walking many miles, you want to make sure you're in shoes that will stand up to the stress. The best bet? Get a pair of waterproof boots with enough support and strength to get you through the trip.


Never go out for a multi-day trip with nothing but sandals, or a flimsy pair of sneakers. Sometimes, tennis shoes can be great, lightweight, and perfect for hiking in some environments, but you want to make sure you've got something sturdy enough for the terrain you'll encounter.

, Dressing in layers allows you to be comfortable in many different weather conditions. Even though it might be warm when you hit the trailhead doesn’t mean that the weather will remain the same throughout the day.


Mountains are notorious for volatile and quick-changing weather systems. Even if it is 90 degrees when you head out, pack a light bag with rain gear, or at least a coat. You also need a hat, gloves, sock liners and socks, underwear, lightweight pants and shorts and good sturdy hiking boots.Try to bring synthetic, wool, or down fabrics, which will keep you warm and dry quickly, instead of cotton.
Bring plenty of socks. You'll be walking a lot, and it's important to keep your feet clean and dry on the trip.

, Hiking in the backcountry usually isn't the time for s'mores and bacon. If you're traveling light, you want to choose food like reconstituted soups and stews that are made with water, or commercially packaged freeze-dried food. You can also learn to dehydrate your own. Pasta is also a commonly eaten hiking food.


It can be helpful for everyone to be responsible for their own snacks but to have a communal dinner. Bring high-calorie and high-protein snacks, like nuts and dried fruit, which can help to fuel you and get you moving. Good ol' raisins and peanuts., Everyone should bring their own sleeping bag, and there should be enough tent space for everyone present. That much is obvious. But you don't want to end up in the backcountry with three people and four tents, or five camp stoves and only one canister of fuel between the three of you. Pack smart. Compare gear with your group and share the essential equipment that you'll all be using, and space it out among your packs.


Bring at least one:

Water filter
Camp stove
Cooking pot or pan


Consider duplicating essential items, like:

First aid kit
Compass
Copy of the map
Lighter or matches
Flashlight



, It's important to make sure all gear is in working order. Give yourself time to test equipment and replace/repair anything that is not working properly. Remember, if an item breaks, you will still need to haul it back.


Clean out your tent, if you haven't since the last time you used it. It's important to get rid of any debris and especially food particles that might remain in the tent, if you've not used it in a while. Set it up and let it air out before you pack it again.
Always get new lighters, new camp fuel, and check the batteries of any flashlights or other items that can fail in the wilderness and leave you struggling.

, Every backcountry camper needs to have in their bag a whistle and a mirror in the event of an emergency. If a hiker becomes separated from the group, the whistle can be used to help find the separated camper. If the event of a more serious emergency, mirrors can be used to signal rescue teams, by reflecting sunlight. Small stuff that can be a life-saver.

, Having a detailed map of the area you'll be hiking is critical to a good and safe hike. Park maps are typically available at trail heads, as well as at the Visitor's Center of most areas, or you can find your own topographical maps at sporting goods stores.


National and State Park maps are typically low resolution, which can be fine for day hikes, but British Ordnance Survey or USGS (US Geologic Survey) have elevation contours and are more accurate and reliable in an emergency, provided you know how to read them. These maps are available at most sporting good stores in the area that you'll hike.
Carry a compass and know how to read it and use it with your map.
You can use some software programs to print your copy on waterproof paper if you cannot access any of the ready printed ones. A GPS device can pinpoint your location, but you should still carry a map and compass.

, Your backpack might feel ok now, but you'll start to notice that it's unbalanced after a few miles and get a serious strain on one shoulder. It's important to try to space out the heavy items in your bag and keep things relatively balanced from side-to-side, and from top-to-bottom.Put the heaviest things toward your back, and low in the bag to help keep you on balance. In general, you want to start packing with the bulkiest and the heaviest items, then stuff extra space with things like clothes and other gear.
Read this article for more information about packing your backpack properly.

, Before you set out, you need to be aware of the unique dangers that the area poses to hikers. Is there poison oak to watch out for? Rattlesnakes? Bears? Is it wasp season? What do you do if you're stung?



Lightening preparedness is a critical part of hiker safety. Learn to identify and find the appropriate shelter in the event of a lightning storm.
If you are going about 6,000 feet know how to recognized acute mountain sickness and how to manage it.
Make sure you know basic first aid for things like cuts, scraps, and broken bones.

, Backcountry hiking needs to happen in a group, unless you're a very experienced hiker. Aim for a small group of like-minded friends, between 2-5 people for a safe hiking trip your first time out. Ideally, you'll want to have an experienced hiker who is familiar with the area you're hiking.


If you are experienced, you have the opportunity to introduce a newcomer to the wonders of backpacking. If you have never been backpacking, you might want to consider going on your first trip with an experienced hiker.
It's best if your camping partners are somewhat compatible in terms of hiking speed, distance they are willing to hike, and camping style. Some people like to travel lightly and hike long distances. Others prefer just getting out of sight of the car.
If you travel solo make sure someone knows your plans and that you have the equipment and skills to be self-sufficient.

, Water is heavy, but critical on a hiking trip. You need to bring enough water so that everyone has at least 2 liters of clean water to drink each day, especially if you're working hard and sweating on your hike.


If you are using a water filter, bring replacement parts, including replacement filters. They often clog with sediment, or just plain break.
Boiling water for at least one minute is an effective backup method, in an emergency., Leave a detailed itinerary with someone who is not going on the trip, including your route, inventory, areas you plan to stay. It's important that someone knows when you expect to return, so they can check in if you're late. Be sure to contact them after you have safely returned.


Leave a note on your car, at least. This can be very helpful in the event that you don't show back up to the car on time.
Check in at the ranger station or the Visitor's Center before you go camping. This is an easy way to let people know how long you're going to be in the area.

, An average hiking pace is 2-3 miles per hour. Don't get overambitious. Shoot for less, rather than more, so you can take time to enjoy the sights. Determine the approximate area where you will camp each night ahead of time. Try to plan your trip so that you camp close to a reliable water source each night.

, All of your food needs to be secured from bears, and kept separate from your tent, if you're going to be hiking in the backcountry. Even if bears aren't regularly found in the area you're hiking, it's important to protect yourself from all sorts of curious animals, who might want to sneak a bite.


If you will be visiting an area with bears, bring a bag and rope to hang your food from a tree, or use an Ursack or bear canister, depending on local regulations.
Follow the same precautions with anything scented, including hair products, shampoo, lotions, toothpaste, and gum.
Always use the same bag for storing and hanging food and scented items, from campout to campout.

Invest in a good pair of hiking boots.,
Train.,
Maintain an even cadence.,
Take your cadence to the trail.,
Adjust for steep terrain.,
Learn to use a walking stick or trekking poles.",How to Improve Your Hiking Technique," Good boots are critical and sometimes expensive. They don't have to be expensive boots (though professionally fitted boots are the best). It is best to know the specific or varied environments in which the hiking will be conducted, this will allow you to select a pair of boots that are appropriate for the conditions. For instance, water resistant features on a boot may be appropriate in areas that experience moderate to low temperatures and heavy rain because they will often lengthen the time during which you can hike with warm, dry feet. Conversely, water resistant boots have little use in a dry climate as they will often prevent your feet from pushing the collected moisture from your feet and socks to the surrounding air. This will result in clammy, and often blistered feet. Boots do have to be comfortable after a period of break-in, durable, and properly fitted. Keep in mind that oftentimes a lightweight, ""broken-in out-of-the-box"" composite boot may not last as long as a full leather boot that requires time and energy to achieve optimal break-in.""


Running shoes or sneakers may not provide the support or stability necessary for hiking, but only if you have weak ankles. Once you've built them up sufficiently, hiking in lightweight running or trail shoes has many benefits such as ventilation, less fatigue, and greater dexterity. The ""marketing-thought"" that our ankles cannot support us in un-even terrain is nonsense, unless your ankles are weak to start, you're carrying a very large load (backpacking),or, on a different note, are hiking somewhere wet (running shoes get very damp).
Approach shoes (a cross between hiking boots and climbing shoes) may be adequate.;
, The more fit you are, the more fun any given hike will be. If you're not in shape, start small. Walk around your neighborhood, climb stairs when you have an opportunity, or take shorter hikes at first. Build up from there, choosing longer, more challenging hikes. Other physical activities, such as bicycle riding, stair climbing, and jogging, can also contribute to your overall fitness level. There are many options for training, so read up, and then get out there.


Trail hiking is different than neighborhood walks on flat pavement, so make sure it is part of your regimen if you are training to hike.

, Cadence is ""a recurrent rhythmical series"" of steps. Good hikers have good cadence. Their steps happen consistently at the same length and in the same amount of time. For example, good cadence might be stepping (from heel to toe) approximately 2.75 feet (0.8 m) in every step, and taking approximately .80 seconds to take each step - and doing that consistently.


To find your cadence, find a hill, preferably paved, with a consistent slope. it does not need to be tremendously steep, but should be at least a couple hundred feet long.
With your boots on, hike the hill 2-3 times a day. Focus on one thing: stepping the same length in the same amount of time consistently. This cadence should feel natural. You don't need to take large or fast steps, just natural feeling, consistent steps. You should be able to keep your shoulders straight and back upright, with good posture.
Continue hiking this hill focusing on your cadence until you find that natural cadence. When you do, you should be able to settle into that cadence and notice that you climb the hill faster with less effort than when not settling into that cadence. You will notice that you can pass people, that are in relatively that same shape as you, with less effort than they are putting forth.

, Once keeping good cadence is easy on pavement, learn to keep that cadence on the trail. Find a relatively easy trail. (In some areas, these will be designated with a green circle or maybe a blue square, but definitely no black diamonds.) Hike that trail a few times a week, focusing on your cadence. Once you get that down, find a trail with some rocks and ruts in it. Then, choose a trail that changes slope and pitch several times. Then, move to harder and harder trails until you can keep a good cadence on almost any trail.

, When you start ascending steep terrain, it will be much more efficient to take shorter steps. Continue to keep a good rhythm, but cut each stride by one-half to one-third the length of your regular steps. This will decrease the energy it takes to make the ascent.

, Once your cadence has become natural, without these tools, then slowly start using your arm muscles to help you.


Get yourself a good walking stick or have a professional help you pick some appropriate trekking poles.
Adjust the stick or poles to the correct height for you.
Using sticks or poles, swing your arms opposite of your stepping foot; and match your cadence. Eventually, you will take much of the effort of the trail off your feet and into your arms, which would otherwise be doing little else for you.
Remember, if using a stick or a pole is messing up your cadence, then it isn't doing you any good.

Spend some time in your front or backyard barefoot.,
Try to interpret the new sensations as just that: new sensations.,
Always step straight down.,
Always watch the path ahead.,
Keep your weight on the balls of your feet and not on your heels.,
Develop habits of awareness.,
Select a short trail with a variety of surfaces for your first barefoot hike.,
Continue short hikes about once or twice a week.",How to Start Barefoot Hiking," Try different surfaces. Take your time, look around and flex your toes gratefully. If you have some local streets, parks or nature centers that are appropriate (not too much traffic or litter) you can extend your pre-conditioning to those areas.;
, At first, the unfamiliar textures overwhelm the tactile senses. The first ten minutes or so for a beginning bare-footer can be the most difficult. You will be in a process of adjustment. Most find that after this time (sometimes just as they were about to give up), the going became considerably easier.

, Never allow your bare feet to kick, shuffle, or drag along the ground. It is lateral movement that produces the great majority of risk of cutting from any sharp surfaces.

, Stop if you want to take a good look at something off the path. When your bare feet are in motion, focus most often on the part of the path two to three paces in front. This practice will become very important when you hike on stony or uneven terrain. You should definitely start on your first day of barefoot hiking even if you are on the mildest of trails.


Being a matter of sensory coordination, much like catching a ball, this is a skill that develops mostly on a subconscious level, but you can consciously help it along by contemplating the fact that you are learning to coordinate two of your senses: the sight of your eyes and the newly discovered tactile sensitivity of your bare soles.

, Within comfortable limits, try to keep more weight on the forward part of your foot, for a longer time during the course of each step, than might previously been your habit.


The ball of the foot is supple and yielding, yet tough and resilient. It is the part where most of the weight of the body (in motion) should be borne. Notice how broad this part of the foot is and how much larger an area it presents to the ground than the heel. Feel how flexible it is, how the toes and metatarsals can move up and down independently to mold to the contour of the earth. This is what allows the ball to absorb shock so much better than the heel.

, You must never forget you are going barefoot so always devote a part of your attention to your bare soles. Be careful and deliberate as you rotate and maneuver your feet around obstacles. You should be ready to retract a step if you don't like the feeling of what you are stepping on.


Occasionally, you will step on something pointy even though you looked carefully before placing your foot. If it's too late to retract a step, quickly shift the weight onto other parts of your foot (heel --> ball, and so on). As you become more conditioned, this will be less of a problem since your soles will be thicker and the (now stronger and more agile) muscles and tendons of your feet will be more adapted to rapid re-configuration.

, If there is a gravel lead-in, consider the end of the gravel as the beginning of the hike. Later, short to medium sections of gravel will be just another texture to you. When you have finished your first day, your feet may seem sore. One of the best things about barefoot hiking is the vibrant, tough and resilient feeling that comes into the feet over the next one or two days as this soreness dissipates.

, You'll find that you'll be able to go further and on rougher trails as time passes. ""Mileage"" will vary, but typically by following the above regimen, you should be able to do four or five miles on easy to medium trails within a month or so. If you take the time to find small-grade gravel paths in local city parks and work out on them, the toughening process can be accelerated considerably.

A coastal desert is an area near the ocean that is fairly dry (average of 8-15 cm or 3-6 in of rainfall per year) and has a very sandy soil. It is characterized by a short, cool winter and long, warm summer, with annual temperatures ranging from 35° C to -4° C (94° F to 25° F). Most plants in these deserts are brush types with extensive roots close to the surface (to catch water before it drains into the sandy soil). Because this is a mild desert, various animals have adapted to survive in coastal deserts. These include coyotes, toads, owls, badgers, and various reptiles.
A semiarid desert is the most commonly found desert in North America, Europe, and Asia since they are generally found in temperate zones. Rainfall averages about 2-10 cm (.75-4 in) per year and temperatures hover around 10° C (50° F) in the evenings. Because of this cool evening period, dew formed in the morning hours can meet or exceed the rainfall for that year, thus, providing many plants and animals with a daily source of water. Rats, lizards, rabbits, skunks, and other small rodents are frequently found in semiarid deserts.
A hot and dry desert is exactly how it sounds: excessively hot and dry. Temperatures vary from extreme cold in the evenings (-20° C or -4° F) to extreme heat during the day (49° C or 120° F). Rainfall is usually less than 1.5 cm (half an inch) per year. This makes for an extremely harsh environment for any organism to live in. However, some insects, spiders, rodents, and birds have found ways to stay out of the heat in the day (burrowing or cave-dwelling) and searching for food during the evening.
A polar desert or cold desert is generally found in the Arctic or Antarctic. Precipitation is light, and quickly forms hard snow packs during most of the year. When vast areas of a polar desert are covered in snow pack, the region is called ""tundra"". Rainfall is generally 15-26 cm (6-10 in) per year, depending on winds and coastal effects. Winter temperatures are rarely above 0° C (32° F), and summer temperatures about 20° C (68° F). Note: Polar/cold desert hiking requires very specialized equipment. This article does not discuss polar desert hiking preparations.
A high desert is a semi-arid area that exhibits many of the features of a cold desert because of its high altitude location. While some of these instructions may apply to high deserts during the warm summer months, traveling in these deserts during other times of the year requires the same precautions as a cold desert, which are not covered here.;
, Even if you are only taking a day hike, you can easily get lost. Provide them with a map outlining the path you intend to follow. Write down what time you plan on getting there and coming back. Tell them that if you don't contact them at the planned time, they should take action to ensure your safety. Check in with that person immediately upon return, so you don't inadvertently have authorities looking for you!

, The very definition of a desert requires the area to receive little precipitation. Most people will hike in coastal, semiarid, or hot deserts. You may not be able to find ANY water supply while hiking, so it is best to bring your own. Not energy drinks, not flavored water, just regular H2O. It's important to remain hydrated in the simplest way possible. It should last for the entire trip.

,, Many deserts have cool or cold nights. It's important to understand that, while the cool air feels good, you can get sick if you aren't kept warm through the night.

, Should include topography and important geological features
Radio
Satellite phone (you won't be getting cellular service out in the middle of nowhere)
Star chart for the correct season and hemisphere

, This food should have lots of calories and good carbohydrates, with protein for energy. If the hike is particularly strenuous or lasts for more than a few hours, however, you should bring an electrolyte replacement (such as beef jerky) to replenish salts lost through sweating (see Warnings).

,, Liquids should be placed in plastic zipper bags.

, This places the backpack square on your shoulders and more evenly distributes the load on your back muscles, instead of just your shoulders.

, If you have hiked in other places, you know that your food and ""Smelly foods"" must be protected. However, in any desert areas, there are no trees to hang traditional bear bags. The solution is to get ""bear canisters"" or some other secure container. Some state and national parks provide these for a small fee. Others have bear boxes in highly utilized areas. Check with park or land management to see what you may need. Bear containers should be placed at least 100 feet downwind of your campsite. Traditionally, you would make a triangle campsite with your tent in one corner, your cooking area in another, and the bear canister in a third.

"
Pack softer and more bulky objects near the bottom of the pack.,
If you use a Camelbak (water bladder), that should also be close to your back, preferably in a pouch.,
Pack ""middle weight"" objects around the middle of the pack.,
Lighter objects that may need to be accessed quickly should be near the top of the backpack.",How to Pack an Internal Frame Backpack1," Keeping softer objects (clothes, sleeping bag, camp towel, etc.) near your body will create a cushion between your body and the harder things you may have packed. Since a sleeping bag is both bulky and soft, that should be put in first, near the bottom and close to the small of your back. Packing bulky objects near the bottom of the pack will also improve your balance with the pack, since a heavy object high in the pack will raise your center of gravity, making you less well-balanced.

, Keeping your water bladder near your back will make it easier to extend your tube out of the backpack, thus make drinking easier., These items should not be as bulky and may include things such as: a cooking kit, stove, dining fly, pots (which should be placed around the middle even though they're bulky, since a hard pot against your back is obviously not comfortable), and water filters.

, These are are the things that are light or delicate, things that may need to accessed immediately in an emergency, or things that may be pulled in and out often. They may include: first aid kits (which may still be placed near the top of the middle section of the backpack), flashlight, maps, camera, and toilet paper, as well as rain gear for both you and your backpack.

Buy a local guidebook.,
Start small.,
Bring lots of water.,
Pack your backpack.,
Protect yourself from the sun.,
Wear the right shoes.,
Ask some friends or family to go with.,
Know what to do in case of an emergency.,
Begin at the trailhead.,

Look out for critters that might be underfoot.,
Take only pictures, leave only footprints.",How to Hike," Hiking guidebooks are essential when it comes to finding the right hike for you. Local guidebooks will also tell you all about the natural landscape around you--from wildflowers you will see while hiking during different seasons, to the types of birds you will see flying overhead. You should be able to purchase a local hiking guide at your local bookstore, outdoor adventure store, or at your regional park’s visitors center. You can also purchase them online.


You can also search online for hikes in your area. Chances are, you will find a bunch of websites detailing some great hikes right near your house--even if you live in the heart of a city like San Francisco (if you actually do live in SF, go check out the Marin Headlands!);
, If this is your first time hiking, you should choose a relatively easy hike. Look for short day hikes that are a manageable distance for your abilities. If you rarely ever go out into nature, you might want to stick with a flat one or two mile track. For others who exercise regularly, an easy five mile roundtrip hike may be more your style--it’s really up to you. Just don’t push yourself too hard your first time out., One of the most important things to know when learning how to hike safely is that you need to bring the right amount of water. Staying hydrated is really important, so drink a good amount of water before you head out on your hike. Bring more water than you think you will need--it’s better to carry extra water than not bring enough and become dehydrated. A good rule of thumb is to bring at least one liter of water per person for every two hours of hiking.Bring even more if the hike is particularly hot or strenuous., Depending on the length of your hike, you may consider bringing different things. In general, however, you should always bring some sort of energy-boosting snack (you can never go wrong with trail mix), a knife of some kind (Swiss Army knives are great), a compass and map, a flashlight, matches or a lighter, and an extra layer of clothing (in case the weather changes suddenly.)and snacksYou could also consider bringing a first aid kit, a compass, binoculars, etc. Just remember that you don’t want to weigh yourself down with unnecessary items. Always bring water.

, Along with the other items you have packed in your backpack, you will also need to bring supplies to protect you from the sun. This includes sunscreen, a hat, and sunglasses. Getting sun poisoning or skin cancer is no laughing matter, so do anything you can to protect yourself from the sun’s harsh rays.

, It’s important to wear shoes that will make your trailblazing easier. Skip the flip-flops and go for laced up shoes that will give you good arch support. If you can, wear hiking boots or trail shoes--these will be the best for maneuvering in rough terrain.


If you have new shoes that you’ve never worn before, break them in before you set out on your hike. If you don’t, you could end up with some nasty blisters on your feet.

, Beginning hikers should stick together or go with more experienced hikers before they head out on the trail by themselves. This is because if you are hiking solo and something happens to you, it is much more difficult to get help. Plan a hike and ask your friends to come along, both for the fun of it but also as a safety precaution.If you do decide to hike solo, let someone else know where you are going and when you are supposed to be back. Tell them you will contact them after you are done with your hike. Do not forget to actually contact them or they may call the police.

, While it is more than likely that your hike will go perfectly smoothly, you should always be prepared for the unexpected. Carry a first aid kit with you, and bring your cellphone. Be prepared, however, that you may not have reception out in the woods. For an extensive guide on how to survive in the wild, click here., Each trail begins with a trailhead--a sign that generally states the name of the trail and the distance to the end (or how long the loop is.) Other trailhead, like those in national parks, will have a map of all of the other trails your trail connects to, as well as different things to look out for while hiking.


If you cannot find a trailhead, you may not be at the right location. Ask someone for directions. Other trails might not have a trailhead--this fact will be specified in your trail guide.

, When you are out hiking, you will inevitably come across a fork in the road. Follow the trail markers that say your trail’s name. If there are no markers available (which is relatively rare) consult your map and look for cairns. Cairns are stacks of rocks that rangers make to show hikers the correct path to take.


You may see small trails branching off from your trail. Do not follow these--often they are simply deer and other forest creature paths that will lead you into uncharted territory. Park rangers and trail maintenance people generally block off these sort of faux-trails by dragging fallen tree branches across the path.

, If you see a sign that says “Stay on the trail” you should--you guessed it--stay on the trail. It is more than likely that that sign is there because there is revegetation happening in the area. When too many people walk in areas other than the path, they can do serious damage to the vegetation.

You will also most likely see a sign that says do not feed wild animals. This is really good advice, as feeding wild animals can hurt both you and the animals. Do not feed wild animals--no matter how cute they look.

, Hiking is not a race, but rather an activity that you can do at your own speed. Don’t be afraid to slow down if you are feeling tired. Drink water throughout your hike and sit down for a rest whenever you feel the need to do so.

, Be aware that when you are hiking, you are passing through the home of many different creatures--from the smallest bugs, to the biggest bears. Do not ever try to approach or interact with wild animals because they are just that--wild.


In particular, look out for snakes. Be careful when walking in rocky areas where snakes are known to reside--stepping on a snake is never a good thing.

, This is a saying we are taught when we are young but it remains true. The wilderness is a place of beauty that must be respected. Do not throw your trash on the ground, disturb the peace by blasting music or talking at the top of your lungs. Do not take rocks, plants or animals with you when you leave the trail--if you do, you are disrupting the beautiful ecosystems around you. To be a true hiker, you must respect nature."

Read all of the instructions first.,
Wash Gore-Tex and other breathable, waterproof synthetic outer shell clothing following the instructions on the label.,
Be careful with synthetic boots.,
Take care cleaning synthetic jackets containing down.,
Wash polar fleece (microfleece or micrafleece) in the washing machine.",How to Clean Synthetic Hiking Gear," It is very important to read the instructions accompanying your synthetic hiking gear. Often a particular type of synthetic material will need to be treated with special care owing to its constitution - not all synthetics are alike. Some are able to be washed in a machine, some are not. Some can be tumble dried; some should not go anywhere near such a machine. If there are separate instructions that come with the gear, file it away for future reference. Often the best place is to use a shoebox that once stored your hiking boots and leave it with your stored hiking gear.;
, Generally, raincoats and other items made from Gore-Tex or similar synthetic materials are machine washable, in cold water (never use hot!), using specially purchased Gore-Tex cleaning products or a very gentle powder detergent that has no bleach content. Specialized products for washing are available at outdoor stores. Often Gore-Tex etc., will require an additional heat step to seal in the restored hydrophobic qualities; an iron or a tumble on low heat might be appropriate. Again, refer to the instructions.

, Hiking shoes and boots should always be clean and in good repair. Your life could depend on it. These should be cleaned so as to improve their hydrophobic capacities. Again, refer to the manufacturer's instructions but generally it is likely that you will need to purchase a good cleaning product suited to the synthetic material that they are made from.

, They should almost always be professionally cleaned, because the down gets wet and clumps together, losing the insulating properties. Read the manufacturer's instructions first. The down may or may not be of synthetic origin. If it is of natural origin, you will be fine washing it in lukewarm water. If the manufacturer's instructions allows it, a bath is a good place as you can submerge it in water with the appropriate cleaning solution recommended on the label, or very soft soap such as Ivory Flakes, without unnecessary agitation. Down needs a soap which is not harsh and has low surfactants. Knead it gently, release the bathwater and do a rinse. Fill and knead again before releasing all the water. Allow to drip dry over the bath without squeezing. A good way to do this is to rig up a clothes hanging device like a hammock. The item should dry flat so that the down doesn't settle. If it does, it will either dry rock hard, or it will dry from the outside, and the inside could mold and rot. Synthetic down can be cleaned similarly unless the label advises otherwise.

, It is happy with cold to warm water. Turn it inside out to reduce pilling. Avoid washing with anything else as the fleece will attract fluff and will also leave fluff on other items of clothing. Fleece can also be tumble dried, although it is good to air dry it for freshness. Pilling gets worse with repeated washes.

"
"
Be sure to compress all things such as your sleeping bag and clothes into as small a package as possible.,
Consider using ziplocs for your clothes.,
Keep your rain gear, which should include a rain jacket, in an outside pocket or at the top of your backpack.,
Pack an extra set of sleep clothes.",How to Pack an Internal Frame Backpack2," If your sleeping bag does not include a stuff sack, you should consider buying one that is both strong and waterproof. Your sleeping bag is one of the things you must not get wet, especially if you have a down sleeping bag.;
, These will ensure that clothing is kept both waterproof in their airtight insides, as well as helping you to compress the clothes. Keep in mind that your clothes should be synthetic, since they will wick away moisture which will keep you warm at night; such clothes are also usually light and porous, which will keep you cool when it's hot and not be a heavier burden in your backpack.

, Keeping rain gear on the outside will allow for easy access and for air drying. (Rain pants may not be necessary since your regular pants should be synthetic and dry quickly)

, Having a clean set of clothes to sleep in will definitely be a plus on the trail. It will keep you feeling fresh even though you most likely will not shower.


Remember: Clothes should not make up the majority of your backpack––there may be 2-3 pairs packed for two weeks including a set of sleep clothes.

If you're carrying something such as a pot that is shared by the group, pack things inside of the pot to conserve space.

,
Try to establish a gear sharing partner before the hiking trip, so that you can divide personal gear between the two of you.,
Finished.

",How to Pack an Internal Frame Backpack3,", For example, one person would bring the sunscreen, while the other brings the bug spray. More importantly, if one person is considerably stronger than the other person, they can carry heavier objects while the less strong person can carry more of the lighter items that might be taking up space otherwise.

,"
"
If you have a Camelbak, be sure to protect it at all times.,
Pack your tent with the poles on one side of your backpack, so that they will take up less space.",How to Pack an Internal Frame Backpack4," If you can fit the bag that accommodates your water bladder into your backpack, that will greatly reduce the chance of a burst water bladder., The tent itself, rain cover, and stakes should be together for organization purposes, or if you're sharing a tent with someone, you can distribute the tent parts. Keeping the poles to one side will also allow you to slide the poles into and out of the backpack more easily than if they were in a different location."

The game you decide to hunt will influence the methods you employ while hunting, the kind of weapon or trap with which you hunt, and where will be best for you to hunt.Some ideas on what to hunt:


Small game, like rabbit, hare, squirrel, pheasant, crow, waterfowl, etc.Big game, like deer, sheep, moose, antelope, bear, bighorn sheep, mountain goat, etc.;
, You won't need an elephant gun to hunt a pheasant, but there are likely a few different guns paired with birdshot that can be used for pheasant hunting. Research the best weapon best suited for the game you have chosen to hunt.Some weapons to consider:


Bow and arrow.
Shotgun.
Black powder rifle.
Rimfire rifle.
Centerfire (high-powered) rifle.

, Ask among your family members or inquire with workers at your local sporting goods store for someone who could answer some questions you have about hunting. You might say:


""I don't have a lot of hunting experience, but I really like nature, and I love the taste of venison. Could you tell me a little bit more about deer hunting?""

, Depending on where you live, how rural the country is, and the local culture, there can be significant differences in the legal definitions of various kinds of game and the acceptable weapons you can use to hunt.


Most locations have a Department of Natural Resources, Fish and Wildlife Department or similar organization that regulates hunting in the area. A quick online search should help you find the relevant agency charged with wildlife management.

, The right hunting tactic will give you even more enjoyment from the sport by offering you the most reasonable chance for success on your hunt. Some common hunting tactics include:


Deer hunting may be done from ground blinds, tree stands, stalking, or by driving prey from brush or cover with a group. Some areas even allow pursuing deer with hounds.Upland birds are often hunted with dogs like pointers or setters, which can actually follow the scent of these game birds. Then, these hunting dogs will point out the prey for the hunter to flush and shoot.Migratory birds are often hunted from blinds, so a successful bird hunter will need to find a feeding area or watering area to hunt. Harvested grain fields, waterways, or other places may offer successful hunts for these birds.
Small game, like rabbits and squirrels, may be hunted using dogs. Beagles are a favorite for rabbits, and some breeds are easy to train for treeing squirrels (or raccoon or opossums)., Many states and areas require you to take a mandatory course in hunter's safety before you can be issued a hunting license, especially when hunting with a gun.Be sure you comply with all regulations, or else you could be fined or suffer other legal consequences, like incarceration., Depending on the area in which you live, you may be able to hunt some animals, like small game, without a permit as long as you adhere to your region's hunting regulations., While you are hunting, an accident might occur that may require medical attention, or you might have to spend the night in the elements waiting for help to arrive. Don't be caught unprepared. Make sure you have:


Extra daily medication (e.g. insulin, blood pressure pills, etc.).
Cell phone or two way radio (in waterproof case).
Appropriate clothing for changeable weather (rain gear, etc.).
Lighters/fire starters.
Metal cup.
Waterproof light source (e.g. headlamp).
Whistle or signaling device.
Emergency shelter (e.g. space blanket).
Survival knife.
First aid kit.
Emergency rations (granola, meal replacement bars, etc.).
Map and compass.

, There will be different methods for hunting the game you choose to as prey. Ambush hunting, stalking, and hound hunting are popular methods employed to hunt various prey.You will need to research your prey to decide upon the most effective style.

, If you plan to hunt from a portable tree stand, you will want to be familiar with carrying and climbing with it before your hunt. The same applies for fashioning a blind, or for the procedure for stalking game.

, Your prey will likely have an ideal habitat. Here you will have a better chance of finding your prey while you hunt. Research the ideal habitat of your prey, paying attention to notes about migration and yearly changes in behavior, and find some locations near you where you can hunt your game.


Hunting on public land is legal, so long as it is not in violation of state, federal or regional restriction, you have the proper licenses, and you are following state, federal or other applicable hunting regulations., You will need enough knock down power for a clean kill, but not so much as to do extensive damage to the game's meat. Here are some examples:


Quail, dove, and other small game birds can be hunted with shotguns using shot sizes between size six and nine in field loads, using gauges from 20 ga. to 12 ga.Turkeys, geese, grouse, ducks, pheasants, etc require larger shot sizes, and preferably larger gauge guns. A 12 ga. or even 10 ga. shooting number two or number four shot is a good choice.Rabbits and squirrels can be hunted with rim fire rifles using hollow point bullets, high powered air rifles shooting at least 750 fps, or shotguns similar to those used for quail and dove.Deer, antelope, and sheep can be hunted with center fire rifles, bows, or muzzle loading rifles. Center fire cartridges should be at least .243 caliber with no smaller than 100 grain soft pointed bullets. Muzzle loading rifles should be at least .40 caliber, and bows should be capable of shooting a broad head arrow capable of delivering a clean kill.Larger game, like elk, wild boar, moose, or bear, should be hunted with larger calibers, such as .30 caliber guns shooting 150 or higher grain soft pointed bullets. Dangerous game hunting requires a gun capable of bringing down charging animals., Modern bows can be equipped with peep sights, pin sights, illuminated or even telescopic sights. Shot guns usually only have a front bead, although slug guns may have rifle type iron sights, or in some cases laser dot sights. Rifles can be equipped with telescopic sights, iron sights, peep sites, red dot sights, or in some cases, combinations of these., There are single shot, double barreled, pump action, semi automatic rifles and shot guns, each with potentially different mechanisms of action.The same goes for bows: there are re-curve, compound, or cross bows.Some people even hunt with pistols. Use a weapon you are capable of handling with confidence.

, You should do this until you are confident in your (and its) ability to do the job. You may want to visit a rifle or bow range, a skeet range, or some other shooting facility. You should take your shooting seriously if you plan on being successful.

, It's best to do a walkabout of the area you will be hunting in so you know the areas in which your game are likely to bed down. This will also give you the advantage if you hit your prey but have to track it.


Take note of any swamps, loose rocks, fallen trees, or any other obstacles that might impede your route to your hunting location.
Be aware of natural animal runs through your hunting area. These are frequently the paths your chosen game will travel, and if you have to track your prey, knowing these will be helpful.

Memorize or take a picture of the tracks you see on these natural trails. When you return home, you can check these against a track guide., It's best to be prepared for bad weather when you go out hunting, even if the weather report calls for fair weather. Knowing ahead of time about inclement weather or other dangerous conditions can save your life., Forgetting something when you are out in the wilderness can be more than inconvenient: it can be dangerous. You should make a checklist and gather the things you will need before going on the hunt.


In addition to the emergency supply kit you put together while preparing to hunt, you should also be sure you are wearing an appropriate amount of blaze orange (also called hunter's orange or safety orange) so that other hunters can see you.

, This way, if you get lost or are the victim of a hunting accident, you will know that help will eventually be on the way. In the wilderness, you can't always rely on a cellphone to get you the help you need.

, If you are hunting on the private property of a friend or neighbor, you must be sure you have the landowner's permission and your hunting license before setting out to hunt.


It's always best to give your neighbor a warning before heading out to hunt, even if you've been told you can hunt there anytime. This will limit your chances for hunting accidents.

, This will jog your memory from the walkabout you took in preparation to your hunting excursion. This will also remind you of the best route to get there and safest path to your hunting location.

, This will change according to the game you are hunting. However, field dressing and hauling a 700 pound elk is not something you want to try without preparation. Take the time to learn what must be done with an animal to avoid wasting the meat you have taken.

, You may need pack animals or other means to haul a large game animal. You should also keep in mind that you will need a place to store potentially several hundred pounds of venison, moose, or elk after your hunt is over.

, This can be useful for developing hunting partners, but can also help in the event that you don't have sufficient freezer space. You can also get tips on how to and prepare the meat.

, A trophy buck might be tempting to drive around and show off, but if the weather is mild, you need to gut the animal and cool the meat as quickly as possible after it is taken.Other game animals have special handling requirements as well.


Game birds should be plucked or skinned and dressed soon after they are taken.Rabbits and squirrels should be skinned and dressed before they become stiff., This will depend entirely on your game and regional restrictions. Evening stand hunting for deer may require you to arrive at your stand in mid afternoon. This way the wildlife will calm from your interruption and your scent will dissipate before your game is most active., You should park your vehicle a considerable distance from the area in which you expect to encounter game, then proceed to your chosen stand or stalking area as quietly as possible., You will be looking for signs, such as droppings, tracks, evidence of foraging, or other indications your game is active in the area., High winds often cause game to hide in thick cover or bedding areas, since the wind will make detecting threatening predators more difficult. Wind also may carry your scent to your game, resulting in spooked animals who will flee long before you get near them., This is especially useful when hunting open country so you can scan for game.You may find you only see a tip of an antler, or the eye of a well-camouflaged rabbit. Once the animal spooks and runs, it will be difficult to get an accurate shot.

, Many species of game have restrictions on the size or sex of the animal you are hunting.Be familiar with local regulations, and make sure your target complies with them.

, You should avoid shooting a game animal that is too far away, moving too quickly for you to properly sight, or is in a position where a miss could result in injury to other hunters or property.If you are not sure of the background, do not shoot. Don't shoot toward or across highways, and never shoot toward buildings or populated areas.

, If you do not make a clean kill, it is your responsibility to make every effort to find the wounded animal and humanely end its suffering.This may mean tracking through rough terrain, patiently looking for blood or other signs showing you the direction of travel, and searching until it is certain there is no hope of finding the animal.

, If you decide on hunting with a friend or friends, be sure they are also attired in an appropriate amount of blaze orange and that they stay in sight while hunting.


Check your gear before returning home; you don't want to bring potentially harmful wild animals into your home by accident.
Do not indulge in alcohol or use drugs while hunting, as this may compromise your judgement and lead to injury.
Test all your equipment before going out on your hunt. The last thing you want is faulty equipment putting you or you hunting partner(s) in danger."

Many times, bloggers will share photos, tips and trail information to ensure other hikers don’t get lost. Do an online search for the trailhead and see what information you can find. Look up what the area is known for--are there rattlesnakes? Bears? Flash floods? It’s always good to know what you might be getting into before you head out.;
, Use a website like weather.com to check out what the weather is like in the area and what the forecast is for the days you will be there. Doing this will help you to pack smartly--if the area commonly drops a great deal in temperature at night, you’ll know to bring warm clothing like a thick coat, gloves and a hat.


If this is your first time backpacking and the forecast is rain (or snow) you may consider moving your trip to another weekend. Wet and cold are not ideal conditions for first time backpackers and can make the going really rough.

, Injuries during a casual day hike are rare; however, anything can happen, especially in more dangerous, unsteady terrain. Knowing how to properly wrap a sprained ankle or treat an infected cut can really come in handy when something unexpected happens out on the trail., Wearing a pack that is too big or that sits too high or low on your back can cause you to strain to your back and neck, which can lead to injury. If you are unsure of what backpack would be best, head to your local mountain gear store (REI, Any Mountain, etc.) and ask for help. In general, when figuring out what volume of pack you should get, keep these guidelines in mind:


Day hikes: use a 15 to 30 liter (4.0 to 7.9 US gal) pack.
One to two nights on the trail: 30 to 50 liter (7.9 to 13.2 US gal) pack.
Two to three nights on the trail: 45 to 55 liter (11.9 to 14.5 US gal) pack.
Extended trips (three nights or longer): 55 and up liter pack.

, Having a water purifier is a very useful thing when it comes to backpacking. One of the biggest dangers of being out in the wilderness is not having enough water and becoming dehydrated. Portable water purifiers will ensure that you never run out of drinkable water. There are several kinds of lightweight purifiers you can bring on your trip. These include:


A pump purifier: This is a handheld pump that works in conjunction with a water bottle. You pump water from a stream into the purifier and it processes the water, making it drinkable. It then pumps that clean water into your water bottle.
An ultraviolet purifier: This uses UV light to kill any bacteria in your water.
Purification tablets: Iodine tablets are the most common purifying tablet. You simply mix the tablets in the water until they dissolve. While the tablets may leave a bit of a strange taste, they kill the bacteria that may be in your water.

, The way you pitch a tent depends on what kind of tent you have. Some tents are easier to assemble than others. Before you head out on your trip, read the instructions for your tent and make sure that you have all of the pieces required to pitch your tent., Most campsites have designated areas where you can build a fire called fire pits. However, when backpacking, you may reach a site that does not have one. If this is the case, and if fires are allowed, you will need to clear a small circle of land so that it is just dirt, and surround that dirt with rocks. Doing this will allow you to have a fire without worrying about setting the whole area on fire. You will also need to gather tinder, kindling, and logs to burn. You should always carry matches or a lighter with you when you go camping or backpacking. Make sure adequate water is available to put the fire out. , Oftentimes a sunny day at the start of your hike can turn into severe weather by the end. Depending on the season, the weather could change to hail, thunder and lightning, a snowstorm or high winds. Pack a waterproof windbreaker that can easily be rolled up and accessed. From fall to spring, consider bringing thermals and a down jacket to keep you warm and dry.

, When going backpacking overnight or on a long day hike, it’s important to not pack too much so that you are weighed down. Instead, pack only what you need. Wear clothes that dry quickly and are lightweight. Clothes, like down jackets, that are warm and can be stuffed into a small ball are great. Layering is key when it comes to backpacking. Fleece is a good material for vests and jackets--it is warm and dries quickly.If you are backpacking in an area that gets cold, make sure to bring gloves, warm socks, and a hat.
Always pack an extra pair of socks. Wet socks make for miserable hikers. Keep the extra pair easily accessible and change socks during the day if they get damp from perspiration to avoid blisters.

, Look for foods high in fiber, protein and good fats to boost and maintain your energy level. Mixed nuts, dried fruit, beef jerky, and even tuna with crackers are some great options to replenish your electrolytes lost from sweating. Outdoor activity stores sell dehydrated meals that are lightweight and perfect for backpacking. All you need to do is add hot water.Eating a handful of nuts before bedtime can actually help to keep you warm throughout the night.
If you are absolutely sure that a water source will be near where you are hiking to, only bring enough water to get to that point along with your water purifier.

, There are quite a few things you should bring with you when you go backpacking because something unexpected is always bound to happen. Essential items include:


Tools to help you figure out where you are. These include a map of the area, a GPS, and a compass.

A headlamp or flashlight to help you see at night. You should also bring a couple of extra batteries in case yours die.
A pot or portable stove. A pot is good because it can be used to boil water over a fire. A small portable stove is also great to have because it allows you to cook a variety of things.
A first-aid kit. This includes band-aids, neosporin, a wrap for sprained ankles, bug spray, gauze pads, and blister treatment.
Tools to help you build and repair. These include a pocket or Swiss Army knife with multiple utilities, duct tape, and a tarp (for emergency situations if your tent gets lost or damaged). You should also bring several plastic bags. They are good for storing trash and wet bathing suits, or for wearing on your feet if you discover your hiking boots have a hole and it starts to rain.
Tools to help you build a fire including a lighter, matches, and a fire starter (for emergencies).

, Sunscreen, sunglasses and a good hat (baseball caps work well) are essential when backpacking. If you get burnt on your shoulders and then have to carry your backpack around, you are going to be one unhappy camper. Waterproof sunscreen works well and stays on even when you are dripping with sweat. Look for sunglasses that are polarized--these protect your eyes more than regular sunglasses., Many of us don’t drink enough water throughout the day, and if you’re going to be doing physical activity, it’s important to consume even more that what’s normally recommended. Be sure to hydrate before your hike even begins. Consider a hydration bladder for easy drinking access during your hike, especially during the hot summer months when you tend to sweat more. A separate bottle with an electrolyte drink mix is a good idea. , Good hiking and camping etiquette means experiencing nature and leaving it as if you were never there. Pack out all trash and animal waste, leave what you find, respect the animal life and minimize the impact of your campfire. Paper waste is okay to burn but bring all plastic out with you. For longer trips, bring a grocery bag or small trash bag to store all trash and dispose of it properly once you leave the area.

, During your hike, keep an eye out for markers and natural landmarks big and small to help you find your way in case you do end up getting lost. Choose a reasonable destination for your first day of hiking and do not stray from that destination.

, Many of us have a competitive spirit and want to reach our destination quickly; however, that can be hard on your body. Consider breaks every 10-15 minutes depending on the level of heat and terrain. Drink plenty of water and listen to what your body is saying to you. If you feel you just need a quick breather, then take it. Many people have been known to pass out or have trouble breathing when climbing up in altitude or when hiking in high heat., When you do make camp, make sure to tie your food up so that no animals can get to it. Use a bear container if the campsite has one. Let animals know you are around. You don’t need to necessarily bang pots and pans around to scare away animals, but you should talk or shout once in a while, perhaps play music and make some noise to let the animals of the forest know you are present.


If you face a large predator, such as a wild cat or bear, then you will need to know how to avoid conflict with it. Do not run (you cannot outrun it), avoid direct eye contact, walk away slowly, don’t scream or yell and remain calm. Consider packing pepper spray & make it easily accessible to protect yourself in case of an attack. If the bear charges, stand your ground and talk in a soft voice. If he attacks, curl up into a ball and essentially play dead. Remain calm., This means finding a good spot for your tent, pitching your tent, and animal-proofing your campsite. Pitch your tent as soon as you get to your site--it is much harder to pitch a tent in the dark.

The JMT ranges in elevation from about 4000 feet above sea level, to 14,505 ft at the summit of Mt. Whitney. All of the southern half is above 8000 ft.
The trail passes through 3 national parks, 5 wilderness areas, 2 national forests, and 1 national monument. There's a very helpful ""tour"" of each with photos here.
There are no huts or shelters along the trail, so you will be responsible for your own campsite and protection from the elements at all times.
There are 10 passes (the high points between valleys) over 10,000 ft, and you will usually be hiking several thousand feet up and then down in a single day.
The JMT grows gradually higher and the passes more demanding as you hike from north to south. In fact, if heading out from Muir Trail Ranch (the halfway resupply stop) with 100 miles (160 km) of food on your back and the most difficult terrain still ahead, it almost feels like the first 100 miles (160 km) were just the warm up!
The trail is well marked, impressively constructed and well maintained. You won't have problems with navigation if you pay attention, and as long as you prepare well and use good common sense, you can enjoy a relatively safe wilderness experience.;
, A map and guidebook will be your best friends.


Many maps are available. The Tom Harrison maps are generally considered very good, but you can also get maps from National Geographic, Blackwoods Press, or Halfmile.
The guidebook by Elizabeth Wenk is a thoroughly researched resource. Her book, ""John Muir Trail - The Essential Guide to Hiking America's Most Famous Trail"", contains a good mix of real-world trip planning advice, human history, natural history, and detailed trail descriptions. The latest version is the 5th edition, released in June 2014.
A good planning guide is Ray Rippel's e-book, ""Planning Your Thru Hike of the John Muir Trail"". Loaded with practical tips, it provides packing lists and three suggested itineraries for different lengths of time.
There are tons of helpful and inspiring JMT videos on YouTube and other websites, including ""Mile... Mile & a Half"". These videos include documentaries, time lapse videos, gear list demos, and how-to tutorials.
A number of online groups and forums exist, including the John Muir Trail Yahoo Group, the John Muir Trail Facebook Group, and the Ladies of the JMT Facebook Group. These forums host an active community of people who plan to hike, or have already hiked, the JMT, and they contain a wide range of resources, including web links, documents, and databases.

, The JMT is usually mostly free from snow between July and September, but it varies by year. Your options are:


June - July: You may encounter some snow, possibly a lot, depending on the year. Stream crossings will be more difficult but water sources will be abundant. You'll see more wildflowers, but also have to fend off more mosquitoes. Days are longer and weather is generally warmer, but afternoon thunderstorms are not uncommon during summer in the Sierra.
August: Generally a good month for hiking the JMT. Snow is usually not an issue and the weather is still warm. A good balance of the trade-offs from earlier and later, which means demand for permits is higher.
September: Some say this is the most stable weather of the year in the Sierra, but it depends on the year. Thunderstorms are usually less frequent, but the risk of an early winter storm is higher. Days are also shorter leaving less daylight for hiking, and nighttime temperatures will drop below freezing at higher elevations. In a dry year, some water sources may be unreliable but this won't be a problem if you do your research. Mosquitoes and people are both less abundant. Wildfires (and their smoke) pose more of a risk, however, especially during dry years.
October: Generally a less pleasant time to hike the JMT. Many resupply locations are already closed, daylight is short, and the risk of encountering an early winter storm is high. On the plus side, getting a permit should be easy and you'll encounter fewer people on the trail, but only experienced backpackers prepared for snow should attempt hiking this late.

,


North to south is most common and allows the hiker to ""warm up"" on the easier and lower passes in the north and acclimatize gradually to the higher elevations in the south. Summiting 14,505 foot Mt. Whitney is far easier after several weeks in the mountains.
South to north is preferred by some who want to get the most challenging climbs out of the way first, or appreciate the aesthetics of the steeper and more dramatic south-side approaches to many of the passes. Starting late in the season might also be a good reason to get the higher elevation passes - and their potential for cold and dangerous storms - out of the way early. It is also easier to get a permit going in this direction.
Allow for a couple of days near your starting point before beginning your hike to acclimatize to the altitude if you live at low elevation and don't know how your body responds. This important whether you're starting in the north or south, but is critical if you're starting on Mt. Whitney. Do some easy day hikes during that time. Learn about altitude sickness and be familiar with the symptoms before you go.

, Many hikers take about 3 weeks to complete the trail, traveling at a pace that's challenging but still leaves time to enjoy the scenery and take a day or two for rest or side trips. This works out to roughly 10-13 miles per day, though some days will likely be longer or shorter.

An important limiting factor is the stretch between Muir Trail Ranch and Mt. Whitney. Unless you hire or convince someone to bring you food during this section, or add a couple of days to hike out to town, you'll need to cover over 100 miles on a single resupply package. Food is heavy and has to fit in your bear canister, so this really limits the amount of time you can spend on this section. Nine to ten days is about the max unless you arrange another resupply.
People who prefer more leisure sometimes take 4 or more weeks, and need to plan extra food resupplies accordingly.  The record for fastest known time on the JMT, set by some amazing ultrarunners, is under 4 days, but that won't be even remotely possible for most people.
If you can manage the time off from work and your life at home, err on the side of allowing more time for your trip. You'll be traveling through remote terrain that's very hard to get to, so you may as well make the most of it while you're there! It's also better to have added flexibility for rest and recovery days--the worst case scenario is finishing a little early, which can be avoided by having some scenic detours lined up.

, You can hike solo, with a partner, or a larger group, and each option will shape your experience in a different way.

Keep in mind that everyone hikes at different paces and has different goals, so it can be difficult to keep a larger group together. Even a group of 4 may find it easier to split into pairs and arrange to meet for lunch and camping. Larger groups camping in the same place also tend to have a more harmful impact on delicate ecosystems.
Be sure to discuss details of your plan with prospective hiking partners before deciding to hike together.  Do you want to hike 8 miles a day at a relaxed pace while taking lots of pictures, while they want to push their limits and do 18? Do you like to sip coffee in the morning and hike into the night, while they prefer to rise at dawn and hit the trail? Are you more comfortable with a fixed schedule, while they like to play everything by ear? You might not make great hiking partners.
Don't be afraid to try a solo hike. A long solo hike can be an amazing life-changing experience, and many people prefer solo hiking after trying it the first time. To test it out, take a short solo weekend trip on a familiar trail, then decide if a solo JMT hike is right for you. There are many friendly people hiking the JMT during the summer hiking season, so in case you get lonely there will be plenty of opportunities to hike and camp with other hikers, and in case something unexpected comes up, there are people around to help out. By the mid-point of the trail, there are many solo hikers who have joined pairs or groups, and there are lots of people sharing food or helping other people out in other ways.

, The trail is too long to carry all your food from the start, so you will need to plan and mail resupply packages to places along the way. Fortunately there are several resorts that will accept and hold a package for you (for a fee).  Your options are:


Tuolumne Meadows: about 24 miles from the trail's northern start in Yosemite, this is a good place to restock if you don't want to carry too much weight between the start and Red's Meadow.
Red's Meadow: about 62 miles in. Friendly resort with well stocked store, picnic tables, bathrooms, restaurant and campground.
Vermilion Valley Resort: 88 miles. You'll need to catch a boat shuttle or walk 4.5 miles around the lake. Popular backpacker-friendly spot with a store, restaurant, and free campground. Your first beer is on the house, and if you ask nicely you might be able to get a complimentary spot in a tent cabin for the night.Muir Trail Ranch: 108 miles, right at the mid-point of the trail, and the last on-trail resupply option for the southern half of the trail. Very small store and no food or bathroom options, unless you're spending the night in a cabin there, but you'll likely want to resupply here anyway since it's your last convenient opportunity. To resupply here, you need to mail a plastic bucket there more than three weeks in advance of your pickup date and pay a fee in addition to the shipping cost.If you don't want to carry all your food for the next 100 miles after Muir Trail Ranch, which could take around 9 days or more, you have a couple of options: You can leave the JMT at mile 186, hike out over Kearsarge Pass to the Onion Valley trailhead and pick up your food resupply box that has been cached in a bear locker. Or hitchhike to town from Onion Valley and get a motel for the night. The Mt. Williamson Motel and Independence Inn have a resupply package that offers pickup and drop off from Onion Valley.This will add one or two days to your trip. Or, hire a pack mule service,or bribe a friend, to hike in over Kearsarge Pass or Bishop Pass with your resupply package, which will require careful scheduling, because food cannot legally be cached in the wilderness by your friend or the pack service.
For people hiking northbound, the 100 miles at the south end of the trail is still a challenge for food resupply, but the difference is that there are plenty of bear lockers along the southern end of the JMT that it is possible to carry more food than will fit in your bear canister during the day, but at night, camp at locations with bear lockers to store the extra ""overflow"" food and other smelly items, until the everything finally fits into the bear canister.
For a map of bear lockers in the High Sierra, visit the climber.org website.
If you're flexible and adventurous, it's possible to resupply without shipping anything by raiding hiker bins at resupply spots and buying food from the stores. Many people ship themselves way too much food and dump the extra into bins full of food up for grabs. Red's Meadow has one basket that fills up throughout the day and gets thrown out at night. VVR has several baskets full of food, along with separate baskets for non-food items (fuel, clothing, sunblock). MTR tends to have a cornucopia of food, gear, and supplies. The stores at Red's and VVR have a good selection of things you might need, but don't count on the store at MTR for anything except fuel.

, This is a good thing to do before any hike, but especially useful on the JMT because of resupply logistics. Some people will prefer to ""wing it"" between resupply stops, but for those who like to plan in advance, here's how.


Make a spreadsheet with each hiking day as a row, and add columns for daily mileage, cumulative mileage, daily elevation gain, tentative campsite location, and notes for things like resupply stops or water sources along the route. It helps to divide your hike up into 3 or 4 segments between resupply locations, and then tackle planning each segment separately.
Using your guidebook and map, start identifying approximate places to camp. You might choose them because they're recommended for their beauty, nice campsites, proximity to water, or simply because they're well spaced for the number of miles you want to hike that day.
Especially in the southern half, the JMT follows a fairly regular pattern of high passes alternating with protected valleys. If you plan your campsites well, you'll often end up camping in a valley, climbing a pass in the morning, and heading downhill to your next campsite in the afternoon. Camping in the lower elevation valleys is easier because it's less cold, less windy, and water is more abundant. Most people sleep better at lower elevations. And many hikers prefer to get the difficult uphill climbs done early in the day, before it gets hot and they get tired.
Don't forget to factor in climbing, descent, and high elevation. If you're hiking over 13,200 foot Forester Pass today, you're probably climbing 3000 feet up before lunch and another 3000 feet down in the afternoon, all in thin air at high elevation, so your mileage for the day might be shorter. On the other hand, you can cover ground relatively quickly on the more gradual, lower elevation trail in Evolution Valley. Don't underestimate the more challenging, rocky terrain of the southern half. You may have your ""trail legs"" by then if you started from the north, but the passes are higher and steeper than their northern counterparts.
Let yourself warm up by planning a couple of shorter days at the beginning of your hike. Then try to intersperse a few shorter ""rest"" days (if you're hiking 15 miles a day, an 8 mile day feels like a rest) throughout the remainder of your hike, to give any nagging aches or pains a chance to recover. Your legs will thank you the next day.
You will probably not follow your plan exactly as you hike. That's ok. But it's important to start with a plan, because then it's much easier to make small adjustments on the fly and still hit your resupply stops on time. It's also a great way to get familiar with the trail and its landmarks and water sources, which will help you feel oriented during your hike.

, The JMT stretches between Yosemite and Mt. Whitney, over 200 miles apart. Unless you plan to turn around and walk back when you finish, you'll need some way of getting back to where you started.

One option is to arrange a car shuttle with hiking partners. Drive separately to your endpoint, leave a car there, drive together to your start point, complete the hike. Then drive together from the endpoint back to the car at the start point, then head your separate ways.
Public transportation is available via the CREST, YARTS and ESTA lines, and can be used with or instead of a car shuttle. Note that these often stop running in early September.
A private shuttle, East Side Sierra Shuttle, offers comfortable transportation on the east side of the Sierra, and custom trips are available.

, You need a permit to hike the JMT, and they're in high demand. See the PCTA permits page for current information.Fortunately, though you'll be passing through several national parks and forests, you only need a single permit for the area where you start.

If you start in the north, you'll need a permit from Yosemite National Park. If you start in the south, you'll need a permit for the Mt. Whitney Zone from Inyo National Forest.
Permits in Yosemite are a lottery system, and currently you need to apply exactly 168 days in advance to have a chance. Permits for the official start at Happy Isles are very hard to get, so many hikers start further south at Lyell Canyon in Tuolumne Meadows. Yes, this cuts about 20 miles off your hike, but it's 20 of the easiest miles to access. If you can't get a permit for Happy Isles and don't want to feel short-changed on total mileage, consider starting at Tuolumne Meadows and making up the extra miles on side trips in more spectacular and remote sections of the JMT.
For other ideas on alternative start locations, see the Yosemite trailhead quotas page.A trailhead with a higher quota will generally be easier to get a permit for, if you're willing to start your trip from a non-traditional location.
As of February 2015, Yosemite has implemented an additional quota for JMT hikers exiting Yosemite via Donahue Pass.Only 45 thru-hikers can get these permits per day, making it even harder to get a southbound permit than in previous years. If you cannot get a permit for the classic JMT, alternatives include:

Starting in Yosemite but exiting the park via Isberg pass, meeting back up with the JMT at Red's Meadows.
Starting at or around Devil's Postpile.
While it's possible to start north of Yosemite in the Hoover Wilderness at a trailhead like Robinson Creek and join the JMT at Tuolumne Meadows, in 2015 the Bridgeport Ranger Station is not issuing any permits to JMT thru-hikers.Call to confirm: (760) 932-7070



, Test these first on training hikes.


Your choice of pack, shelter and sleeping bag will depend on how much weight you're willing to carry. ""Traditional"" backpackers, carrying 40-60 pounds, definitely do complete the JMT. But it's also increasingly common to see semi-lightweight backpackers carrying minimalist packs, tarps instead of tents, and lightweight down sleeping quilts instead of bulky synthetic sleeping bags.
If you choose the lighter weight route, the best gear is often found in smaller online shops and not available at your neighborhood REI. Check out names like Mountain Laurel Designs, Enlightened Equipment, Six Moon Designs, Gossamer Gear, Tarptent, and many more.
Whatever you choose, make sure it's adequate to keep you safe and comfortable and you know how to use it. Your pack should be able to carry food and water for your longest segment, including the extra 2-ish pounds added by a bear canister. Your sleeping bag should be rated for 30 degree F temperatures at the warmest, and cold sleepers hiking in September should consider 10 or 0 degree bags. Your tent or tarp must keep you and your gear dry through a night of rain and wind.

,  If you're not an experienced backpacker, do your research on clothing systems for backcountry hiking.  Weather can range from 90 degrees F on a summer day to below freezing and windy at night. Bring the layers and accessories (gloves, hat, etc) to be safe and comfortable. Many people choose to wear long sleeves and pants for protection from the sun, since many parts of the trail are exposed and at high altitude., During a long hike, a good portion of your day revolves around water - finding it, purifying it, drinking it. You'll need:

A water purification system. It's generally not a good idea to drink directly from streams and lakes in most parts of the High Sierra, because bacteria from people and livestock can make you sick, though some people do choose to take the risk and drink unfiltered water. Water purification systems come in many forms, including gravity filters, pump filters, UV sterilizers, squeeze filters, and chemical tablets and drops. Research the tradeoffs and choose what's best for you. A Sawyer squeeze filter attached to a Smart water bottle is common setup for ultralight hikers on the JMT.
Four liters of water carrying capacity. There are many ways to arrange this, but one useful system is a 3 liter hydration bladder with hose that you can drink from while you hike, plus an extra 1 liter bottle. The bottle is faster to fill up, better for dispensing water to cook with, and easier to keep in your tent at night. While many people feel it's better to be safe than sorry, there are also many people who hike the entire trail with only two liters of carrying capacity, but this is only recommended for those who have the confidence to hike further if your planned water source is dried up (especially later in the season).

, The internet is full of checklists and blog posts about what to include in your backpack. Long debates have occurred over which particular type of titanium pot is best! Do your research and look for resources from communities that match your hiking style. REI has a good standard checklist if you're just getting started.Going ultralight? Check out the gear forums at backpackinglight.com.  This is not a complete list, but here are some JMT-specific gear suggestions:


Hiking poles are extremely useful on the steep and rocky JMT. Even if you don't normally hike with them, consider bringing a pair. They will steady you during creek crossings and support your tired knees and ankles on many steep and rock-strewn sections of trail.
Bring a camera! The JMT is incredibly scenic. Depending on your phone for picture taking might drain the battery extremely quickly.
You'll need a cooking system that's lightweight but reliable. A small folding stove and single titanium mug or pot would be a good choice, but do some research if you're curious about other options. Many people eat and drink out of the same pot they cook in. Keep in mind that high altitude, cold, and wind all extend cooking time of your meal, and at higher elevations on the JMT the difference is noticeable, so budget extra fuel. Post Office rules prohibit shipping fuel in resupply boxes, but you'll be able to purchase standard backpacking stove fuel canisters at resupply points.
Some kind of light, ideally a headlamp (and extra batteries), is essential.
Don't forget rain gear! Sudden thunderstorms are common in the Sierra in summer, and the temperature can drop below freezing at night, making wet clothing and gear a dangerous problem.  A waterproof pack cover and/or lining, rain pants and waterproof jacket, or poncho, are essential.

, Parts of the JMT are fairly remote, and you may hike for half a day or more without seeing anyone. The nearest town can be a three day hike away. In addition to being prepared with proper gear, you should always have a basic first aid kit (and know how to use its contents!). A compass should always be carried though the trail is well-marked, and a good map is a must. Know how to use them both, and know the exit routes in case of emergency., A camera, small journal, or good book (consider the Kindle app if you carry a smart phone) are nice options, but don't go overboard. It's easy to think you can't do without something, but your daily routine on the trail will be so different that you probably won't miss what you don't bring., More exhaustive general lists can be found on the internet, but here are some notable items to consider for many long hikes and the JMT in particular.

Entire days of hiking will be spent above treeline with no shade, so sunscreen and sunglasses are required. Some people wear lightweight gloves to protect the backs of their hands, which get a lot of sun exposure if you use trekking poles. Many people wear lightweight pants and a long-sleeved sun shirt to provide sun protection as an alternative to applying sunblock.
A small bottle of bug repellent is helpful if hiking earlier in the summer. A headnet is also recommended if you are one of those people that bugs really enjoy eating.
Baby wipes will seem like the best thing ever. At the end of a long and dusty day (the JMT is a dusty trail when dry), start with your face and hands and proceed to progressively dirtier areas. Pack out the used wipe in your trash bag.
Deodorant, lotion, and soap are all optional, believe it or not. You'll have to carry them the whole way, and many people stop using them after a few days once they've adjusted to life on the trail. A small bottle of hand sanitizer is a great alternative to soap, and doesn't harm the environment (even ""natural,"" biodegradable soaps can disrupt fragile ecosystems). For brushing your teeth, a few drops of biodegradable soap per brushing will do the trick and is better for the environment than toothpaste. Bringing a packet or two hand ointment such as Aquaphor in case your hands get very dry and crack later in the trail can be a nice luxury.
Don't forget toilet paper or wipes! Just as importantly, don't forget a way to pack it out. Yes, all of it. No, burying it doesn't count. It doesn't always stay buried thanks to animals and erosion, and no one wants to hike through other people's used TP. Here's a system that works: put some bleach powder in a plastic bag, then double bag it in another plastic bag, ideally an opaque (non-see-through) bag if you can find one (or just cover it with duct tape). Include one of these setups in each resupply package so you don't have to reuse them. You might even want a spare inner bag to change out between resupplies. If this sounds gross to you, don't worry, you'll get used to it. It's well worth the minor unpleasantness to keep the wilderness lovely for many years to come.
Extra plastic bags are always useful for something. Bring a few in several sizes and include a few more in your resupplies. Large ones (kitchen garbage bags) make useful lightweight pack liners and emergency pack covers. Medium ones (gallon ziplocks) are great for your food-related and personal trash. Small ones (sandwich bags) are perfect for protecting your camera or journal from water.

, Ideally you will do this several times on shorter training hikes. The day before hitting the trail is not a good time to find out that your pack weighs half as much as you do and your sleeping bag won't fit inside it.

If you are really into shaving ounces, weigh each item of gear separately and create a spreadsheet. This will allow you to make informed decisions about weight tradeoffs, like ""if I don't bring that bottle of biodegradable shampoo, I can bring 10 baby wipes and an extra pair of socks!""
If you're not quite that detail-oriented, simply put all your gear and clothing in your pack, step on a bathroom scale, then subtract your weight without the pack. This is known as your ""base weight,"" the weight of your gear without food and water.
When weighing your gear, don't underestimate the amount of weight food and water will add. Food weighs 1.5 to 2 pounds per day, and water weighs 2.2 pounds per liter. For example, 5 days of food and 3 liters of water would add over 16 pounds to your pack!

, Black bears on the JMT are typically not dangerous to humans, but hikers need to take special precautions to keep it that way. Storing your food and scented toiletries in a bear canister is required on the John Muir Trail, both for your safety and that of the bears.  A bear that makes a habit of eating hiker's food in the backcountry will often be killed by rangers due to safety concerns, and no one wants to be responsible for that. And, if a bear eats your food supply on the most remote portions of the trail, you're going to have an unpleasantly hungry hike out to the nearest town two days away.

A standard bear canister can be purchased for about $80 from an outdoor gear store. It will add about 2.5 lbs to your pack weight.
Lighter canisters are more expensive, so decide how much you care about weight. If you spring for the ""Cadillac of bear canisters,"" the carbon fiber Wild Ideas Bearikade, you will pay over 3 times as much for 31 ounces of carbon fiber and aircraft aluminum alloy awesomeness. Wild Ideas also rents these to JMT hikers for a much more reasonable price.If you don't need a bear canister in your gear collection permanently, you can rent one in Yosemite for much less money.Depending on your resupply plans, you may be trying to fit as much as 10 days of food into a bear canister on the southern half of the JMT! This is almost impossible unless you plan on eating nothing but peanut butter for 10 days (not recommended). Consider getting a larger canister, like the Bearikade Expedition, to make your life easier. Note that national park regulations may allow you to bear hang your food in the area near Muir Trail Ranch (check local regulations), so if you choose your camp location carefully and bring rope/cord, you can cut a day off the amount that must fit in your canister.

, Review your goal itinerary from part one.  Your hiking speed, time constraints, and pack weight concerns should have already determined where you'll need to mail food packages or (if you have really nice friends) have a friend hike in to meet you.

Each resupply location has specific mailing instructions, forms and fees, so make sure to read their websites carefully or your package may not be waiting for you when you arrive.
Be prepared to mail your resupply packages about 3 weeks before you'll pick them up.

, If you haven't already, make a spreadsheet with a row for each day you'll be on the trail. Mark resupply days on the spreadsheet, and figure out exactly how many breakfasts, lunches, dinners, and snacks you'll need based on how many days are in each segment.

For example, if you plan to eat lunch and resupply at Red's Meadow around lunchtime on day 4, and you will have breakfast in Yosemite before you start on day 1, you'll need 3 breakfasts, 3 lunches, 3 dinners, and about 3.5 days worth of snacks to get you through the first segment.
If you have space in your bear canister, consider packing an extra partial or whole day of food. Yes, it's extra weight, but life is uncertain in the backcountry. If your resupply stop is delayed by a day while you wait to avoid a dangerous electrical storm on the next high pass, you'll be hungry and grumpy unless you have a little extra food stashed away.

, There are many great resources on the internet for optimizing hiking food, so do your research. Everyone seems to have their own preferences, but here are some general guidelines that apply especially well to longer trips like the JMT:


Most hikers need about 3000-3500 calories per day. That's probably a lot more than you usually eat, but after a few days of climbing high mountain passes with a heavy backpack, you'll still be fantasizing about food, no matter how much you brought. Your food will weigh about 1.5 to 2 pounds per day.
Dense foods high in protein and fat are satisfying and full of energy: nut butters, hard cheeses, salami. These pair great with tortillas, which happen to fit nicely in the bottom of a bear canister...
Dehydrated food helps save space and weight, especially for staples like grains. At higher elevations on the JMT, a traditional canister stove takes longer to cook your food, especially when it's cold and windy, so choose foods that rehydrate quickly or learn to love crunchy rice and pasta. An insulating pot cozy can help. Couscous is the easiest grain to cook on the trail, as it rehydrates in only a couple of minutes and can even be rehydrated with cold water in a pinch (takes longer though). Rice and pasta also work if they are cooked first, then dehydrated. Grains like quinoa and uncooked pasta can take a really long time and burn through a lot of fuel. Ramen and instant mashed potatoes are common backpacker dinner staples, and ramen can be substituted for pasta in many dishes.
Convenient foods like energy bars, dried fruit, trail mix and sports gels are great for quick snacks. Bear Valley Pemmican bars pack in more calories (over 400 in a bar) than most bars and are a great compact source of nutritious trail food.
Freeze-dried chicken, bacon bits, or beef jerky are great ways to add more protein to your meals.
Some hikers bring a container of olive oil or ghee and add some to each meal for more calories.
Don't forget some favorite indulgences! Dark chocolate (may melt), instant coffee, tea, or even dehydrated pumpkin pie (really!) will taste heavenly on the trail.
Delicate foods like crackers and cookies, though delicious, will likely get crushed in your bear can.

, You have many options here, depending on how much time and money you want to spend:

Purchase freeze-dried meals from an outdoor gear store. These are more expensive but very easy.
Dehydrate your own food. This is less expensive than buying dehydrated meals, and gives you more control over your menu, but it does take time.Buy/make and combine dehydrated and freeze dried ingredients into your own recipes.  For example, mix instant oatmeal with powdered whole milk, freeze dried apples, almonds, salt and cinnamon for breakfast.  Or, mix couscous or instant rice with curry powder, freeze dried veggies, freeze dried chicken, and some added olive oil when you rehydrate for dinner.

,

Read the guidelines for each resupply point you're using. They all have their own preferences for packing and labeling. A five gallon plastic bucket, with the lid securely taped down, is a common choice.
Brace yourself for the postage fees. It can cost $20 - $40 to mail each package, in addition to the fees each resort charges for picking up and holding them.

, It's easy to say ""I'm sure it'll fit!"" from the comfort of your kitchen, but when packing your resupply into your bear canister on the trail and half your food doesn't fit, you'll have a dilemma on your hands. Better to know in advance and modify your menu to include denser, more compact foods.


If the bears don't get your food, the marmots will! These guys live above treeline in higher elevation areas and can be quite aggressive, especially in areas like Guitar Lake where they are used to an easy meal because so many hikers camp there. Look away for a second and your food will be gone if it's not in the bear canister!

, If you are already fit and active, you may not need much extra training to complete the JMT, but a little extra physical preparation will make your experience more enjoyable. If you're becoming more active for the first time in a while, the steps below should help you prepare., During your hike, you'll likely be walking for 6-8 hours a day or more. Getting your body used to that much activity, especially for people who work at a desk all day, is difficult. The more you make a habit of daily activity, the less foreign it will be to your body during the hike.

Walk everywhere you can. Park far away from your destination. If you can, run errands on foot. Going to the grocery store? Bring a backpack (great training) and carry your groceries home on your back.
Lots of variety will help you get strong with less risk of overdoing any particular thing. Try to incorporate a variety of activities into your week: walking, running, biking, yoga, lifting weights, whatever else you enjoy.

,

Start with a distance you can comfortably hike, whether that's 2 miles or 10, and add a mile or two each time. Try to get out for these shorter day hikes a couple of times a month in the months before your hike.
Once you can comfortably hike a given distance, try adding a pack with extra weight. Hand weights, water bottles, rocks, and sand are good choices if you don't want to pack your full gear collection every time.
Push yourself in one aspect at a time during training hikes. For example, focus on your endurance by taking longer hikes without a pack. Alternate these with shorter hikes with heavier pack to focus on strength.
Work up to at least one two-night trip with all your gear. Ideally, do several trips of 2 or 3 nights on the trail, to get comfortable with managing your gear and hiking for several days in a row.
Focus on hill training. Long climbs and descents are a hallmark of the JMT. Some days you'll start climbing first thing in the morning and not hit a downhill until after lunch. As much as possible, train on hills, the longer the better. If you live in a flat area, get creative and seek out stairwells, stadium bleachers, or even the stair climber machine at the gym.

, Many hikers worry about their knees and ankles, but your hips and glutes (butt muscles) should be your body's main source of power and stability. Get these muscles strong and coordinated, and your knees and ankles will usually take care of themselves.

Do lightweight exercises like glute bridges, clams, and quadruped hip extensions with perfect form to ""activate"" your hip and butt muscles. This will strengthen the connection between your brain and the muscles so they are easier to recruit to their full potential.
If you have access to coaching or can carefully research technique, learn to properly and safely perform weighted barbell exercises like squats and deadlifts. These exercises are one of the fastest ways to build a strong, stable athletic body. After a few months of these, you'll be amazed at how much stronger and more comfortable you feel after a long day of hiking. You'll recover faster too, which is key when you have to wake up tomorrow and hike all day again.

, Muscles adapt fairly quickly to increased activity, usually within a few weeks or months, but tendons, ligaments, and bones are slower to strengthen. If you're training seriously for your hike, make sure to take periods of rest so any weak spots have time to recover. If you injure yourself from training unwisely, your hike may never happen., This means a good diet, enough sleep, and enough rest. If you are worried about your preparation, this is not the time to go crazy and wear yourself out with intense training. Have faith in the preparation you've already done, and understand that your body takes several weeks to adapt to training, so if you're trying to cram it in at the last minute, it probably won't help anyway., Following these principles will help preserve all the things we love about the wilderness for ourselves and future generations. Everyone who bothers to secure a permit for the JMT probably knows not to leave their granola bar wrappers on the trail, but here are some equally important guidelines you may not be as familiar with:


Don't dump your pasta water or dirty dishwater on the ground. It contains food and can disrupt fragile ecosystems and attract animals. The gold standard is to rinse out your pot or cup with water and then drink the water. When you have to purify and carry every sip of water you drink, this will seem like a good idea for multiple reasons. You actually don't need dish soap for this, which can still be disruptive when used in large quantities, even if biodegradable. Simply leave your pot or bowl out in the midday sun for an hour or two to prevent bacteria growth. Same goes for bigger food scraps; eat them or pack them out.
If drinking the rinse water seems gross to you, try making ""cleanup soup"" with a packet of ramen or miso seasoning. It dissolves and tastes decent with cold water (though you can warm it up if you want to allocate the extra fuel) and after that you only need a much smaller rinse and sip to clean your pot.
If you do use biodegradable soap to wash dishes (or clothing, or yourself), never dump the soapy water in a lake or stream. Soap will biodegrade quickly in the soil, but it will last for many years in a cold mountain lake, leaving a ring of bubbles around the shoreline long after you are gone. Dump it at least 100 feet away from any body of water.
Camp in previously used campsites instead of creating new ones, no matter how inviting the spot looks. Learn to spot the mark of an established tent site: flat, rectangular, and clear from vegetation. Avoid camping on living plants, and don't camp within 200 feet of water sources to protect the fragile environments near lakes and streams.
Check campfire regulations and always respect areas where fires are prohibited. Typically this is due to either forest fire risk or lack of sufficient firewood. On the JMT, you'll see signs prohibiting campfires in many of the higher elevation areas above treeline, because if hikers started using the scarce vegetation for fuel, the lovely high country would be stripped bare.
Never go to the bathroom within 200 feet of a lake or stream, to avoid introducing harmful bacteria into the water supply. Avoid going near the trail or established campsites to minimize the chances of others encountering your leavings, and bury solid human waste in catholes at least 6 inches deep.
In the Mount Whitney area, you will be required to defecate in a in a WAG bag, which you carry out with you and dump in special dumpsters located at the Whitney Portal trail head. Though the kit provided when you pick up your permit has a double bag system, you might feel more comfortable if you have yet a third bag in which to enclose the stuff.Pack out all used toilet paper. See the section above on preparing your gear for more detail. Some people think burying it is acceptable, but sometimes animals dig it up or erosion uncovers it for future hikers to encounter. If you've ever hiked in highly used areas where people don't respect the wilderness, you know how unpleasant these ""toilet paper blooms"" can be.

, Have a plan for where you'll fill up next, and arrange to camp near water as often as possible. Water on the JMT is usually abundant, especially earlier in the summer and following high snow winters. Even in September after the dry winter of 2013-2014, it was still possible to situate almost every campsite and lunch spot by a lake or stream. If you pay attention to the map and know where the next reliable water source is, you can often save weight by carrying only a liter or two at a time. But even with water every few miles, missing a refill opportunity when you're running low can leave you uncomfortably thirsty for a few miles at best. At worst, you risk heat exhaustion and dehydration if hiking in the heat of summer through very exposed terrain.


Don't assume every creek or small lake on your map is reliable. Snowmelt in the mountains is dynamic and varies each year. Many small creeks dry up every year during late season. Some small lakes may completely disappear during a dry year.
Water is often available every mile or so on the JMT, but there are a few longer potentially dry stretches to be aware of.Notably, the section between Guitar Lake and Whitney Portal has a few water sources on the descent from Whitney (heading south), but between Guitar Lake and Trail Crest the options are very unreliable. You'll want to stay well hydrated on the high-elevation ascent of Whitney, so be sure to pack extra water for this stretch. At the northern end of the trail, Little Yosemite Valley to Cathedral Lake can also be a long dry stretch if a few key water sources are unavailable.
Ask hikers coming the other direction where the next water source is. They'll be happy to tell you, especially if you exchange some information about the direction they're headed.
When in doubt, top off your supply of water whenever you have a chance.
When you stop for lunch or arrive at camp for the night, start filtering water right away. This is especially true if you have a gravity filter - fill it up, eat, and it'll be ready when you're done.

,

If you feel a blister coming on (the feeling often called a ""hotspot""), stop and take care of it right away. If there is no evidence of a blister yet, apply a generous amount of anti-friction ointment like BodyGlide. If you do see a blister developing, treat it immediately. You did bring a blister kit, right? Some athletic tape and moleskin will come in very handy. Cut the moleskin into a donut that surrounds the blister so that it takes pressure off the irritated spot.
Rinse your feet and socks regularly, ideally when you stop for lunch and at each night's camp. It not only feels good, it also helps prevent dust from irritating your skin and causing blisters. It even helps just to change your socks every few hours; smack the socks you just removed against a rock a few times to shake off the dust, then strap them to your pack to dry off and air out as you walk before putting them back on later. Keeping your feet clean and dry goes a long way in blister prevention.
Your body may feel stiff and unbalanced after so much hiking, so take some time in the mornings, evenings, or during rest breaks to stretch and move around in ways that don't just involve putting one foot in front of the other.
Bring a golf ball! It sounds strange, but it's small, lightweight, and the perfect remedy for tired feet at the end of a long day. Roll it gently under the arch of your foot, the backs of your calves, or anywhere else that could use a massage.

, The more serious forms can be fatal: High Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE) and High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE). The best response depends on the severity of symptoms. For mild AMS, taking an extra day before ascending further may be all that is necessary and symptoms may resolve. For HAPE, and especially HACE, descent may be required. , Not only is it fun to identify all the landmarks in distant vistas, it's also a basic wilderness skill that will help you identify water sources, predict the time to your planned campsite, and understand the difficulty of the terrain ahead of you., Summer thunderstorms are common in the Sierra, and the high, exposed passes on the JMT are dangerous during electrical storms. You should never attempt a pass when there is lightening or possibility of lightening nearby. Instead, rest your legs and wait out the storm in a safer, lower valley.


This is especially true of Mt. Whitney, where hikers have died from lightening strikes on the summit. It's never a good idea to be the tallest thing around in an electrical storm, so being on top of the tallest mountain in the lower 48 states is obviously a horrible idea. If you hiked north to south, Whitney might be your final day and you are probably excited about finishing and almost out of food. It can be very, very tempting to push though during a storm but it's not a risk worth taking. You won't die from one day without food, but you can certainly die from a lightening strike.
Mountain thunderstorms often form in the early to mid-afternoon. This is another good reason (along with cooler temperatures and fresher legs) to arrange your campsites so that you're up and over the highest passes before noon.
Reading the weather can be difficult, because it's normal to see harmless puffy clouds that don't turn into thunderstorms. Keep an eye out for clouds that grow taller, darker on the bottom, and/or flatter on top, as these signal a thunderstorm forming.
For vague but longer-range planning, try asking other hikers if they've heard a recent weather forecast. Forecasts often aren't accurate several days out so don't depend on them completely, but they can give you a general idea of what to expect. It may have been weeks since you last had access to the internet, but hikers out for ""only"" a long weekend might have more recent information and will be happy to share it with you. You can also ask staff for the latest forecast at resupply stops.

, You're in a beautiful, remote location that's impossible to drive to and requires, at best, several days of hiking to reach. Make the most of it! Your guidebook will have numerous suggestions for short day trips off the JMT. Make time and energy for a few, you won't regret it., The simplicity of hiking for days can make it easy to feel joy over small things. Savor an energy bar on top of a 12,000 foot pass while looking back at all the ground you just covered. Soak your dusty feet in a creek during lunch. Watch the sun set while you make camp at the end of a long day. Spend a few minutes looking at the stars before you zip up your tent at night.

Go for a swim whenever possible. It will be cold and you will need to garner courage to fully submerge, but you will feel cleaner and more refreshed, and there's a saying that ""you never regret a swim"" which applies on this trail. Do watch your footing, though, or wear sandals or your stream crossing shoes to make sure you don't cut your foot on a rock or branch.

, These are often where you will run into other hikers who have been slightly ahead of or behind you on the trail, so take a minute to chat and celebrate your shared progress as you cram your resupply into your bear canister. These are also good places to indulge that random food craving you've been obsessing about for the last 50 miles. A beer and an ice cream sandwich at the Red's Meadow picnic tables just might be the best snack you've ever had.

Red's Meadow and Vermilion Valley Resort are great places to buy snacks or a hot meal, enjoy the wonders of a real bathroom, and restock on anything you may have forgotten from the general store.
Muir Trail Ranch is more minimal. No bathroom, no ice cream, no beer unless you're a paid guest. There is a small store but it carries only bare essentials, because they have to pack everything in on horseback. If you're not staying the night in their cabins, you'll probably may want to unpack your resupply box and move on, or enjoy the public Blaney Hot Springs across the river.
The directions to the campground and hot springs posted at MTR are a little confusing. After the trail drops you off at the river, cross it into an obvious campground, but bear right as you continue forward. At some point you will bump into (well, hopefully not literally) a barbed wire fence on your right that marks the border of MTR. Follow this fence into a meadow; a hot spring is right up against the fence. Not far away is Warm Lake, which isn't actually warm, but is called that because it gets a small amount of hot spring heat which makes it not as cold as most lakes.
Except for Tuolumne Meadows, all the resupply stops mentioned here have ""hiker bins"" where hikers can leave food and supplies they don't need, and pick up free stuff left by others. Take advantage of these, both to unload weight you don't need, and to discover someone else's discarded snack that suddenly looks like the tastiest thing in the world after eating exactly the same kind of trail mix for two weeks straight.

, The first couple of days, if you're not used to backpacking in the mountains, it can seem like setting up and breaking down camp takes an eternity. By the time you've pitched the tent, filtered water, cooked dinner, packed up your bear canister, set up your sleeping pad, and crawled into your tent, an hour or two may have gone by. Don't worry, you'll get faster as your hike goes on. Here are some tips:

Do tasks involving water (filtering, rinsing dust off your body) as soon as you get to camp. At high elevations surrounded by tall mountains, the sun dips behind the nearest peak well before typical sunset time. Splashing around in a cold mountain stream trying to fill your filter bag can leave you uncomfortably cold once the sun goes down. If you're lucky enough to have a gravity filter, get it started as soon as you arrive and it'll be ready by the time you've pitched the tent.
If you're not hiking solo, you can split up camp chores to make them go faster. Maybe one person prefers to cook, while another would rather set up the tent. It can make sense for the person who gets cold most easily to do more physical tasks like setting up the tent, since it can often be done with gloves on and involves moving around more.

, You will have easy days and hard days. On the hard days, it's tempting to think things will continue getting worse. But very often, the next day you will feel stronger than ever and you will marvel at your body's ability to adapt.

, If you hiked from north to south, Whitney's 14,505 ft summit - the highest in the continental United States - is your moment of triumph. For a truly spectacular end to a spectacular trip, try hiking up in the dark (carefully, watch your footing) and watching the sun rise from the summit. Bring plenty of warm layers (you can drop your pack a few miles from the top) - it's chilly up there. And don't forget, you still have 11 miles of unrelenting downhill before you exit at Whitney Portal, so save some energy for the descent.


Whitney Portal (the southern trailhead of the JMT) has a store and restaurant where you can enjoy that food item you've been dreaming about for the last week. Once you've finished celebrating, you can hitchhike the 11 miles to Lone Pine (a common practice in this area since many hikers are headed that direction) for a night in a hotel or hostel. There's also a campsite at Whitney Portal, if you can't get enough of sleeping under the stars. Check the Inyo National Forest website for more information.

, Friends and family will want to know what it was like to live in the wilderness for several weeks. If you took photos, enjoy looking back through them and sharing them with people who ask. Others who didn't have the time or persistence you did may enjoy living vicariously through your adventure, and you can encourage them to plan an adventure of their own one day., If you wrote in a journal, read through it. Look back through your guidebook at your favorite parts of the trail. You might find it interesting to compare the descriptions to your actual experience, and it will help calibrate your expectations the next time you're planning a trip from a guidebook., Though you haven't actually been gone that long, it's easy to get used to the slower pace of hiking all day and sleeping under the stars at night. For many people, long distance hiking is a temporary escape from life's daily demands. Coming back to ""real life,"" with its constant stream of emails, traffic, and people, can feel overwhelming at first. Realize that you are calibrated to a slower pace (about 2-3 miles per hour!) and be patient with yourself - you'll be back in the swing of ""real life"" all too soon., After experiencing the beauty and solitude of the John Muir Trail, you might be hooked on long distance hiking. Want more of the High Sierra? Check out the Tahoe Rim Trail. Inspired to take things up a notch? Some people take months to hike thousands of miles on the Appalachian Trail or Pacific Crest Trail. Can't quite devote a whole summer to hiking? The Colorado Trail is only about 500 miles. Interested in a trail outside the US? Countless options abound, like the Torres del Paine circuit in Chile. Even when real life stands in the way of multi-week adventures, you can always tap into the peace and beauty of the trail on a weekend backpacking getaway. Happy Trails!"

Start with your squirrels and a good sharp knife or two, as well as a bucket, jug, or pan with water to put the cleaned squirrels in.,
Put your squirrels in a bucket of water to wet them down and let them soak a little.,
Pull a squirrel out of your bucket and hold it by the tail, with the belly away from you.,
Put the squirrel’s tail down on a hard surface and step on it.,
Pull until the skin gets up to around the front legs / shoulders.

Work your fingers up around each front leg (the front) to separate the skin from the meat.,
Take your hands and break the bones in the front legs (like breaking a stick).,
Now to start to work on the back half.,
Grab the legs and break them, as before with the front.,
To start gutting the critter, turn the squirrel over with the belly toward you, with the back legs up.,
Once you get down to the pelvic bone, put the tip of your knife in under the pelvic bone and pull up to split the bone.,
Now, flip the squirrel over and grab a front leg.,
Once the front legs are cut off, plop them into your bucket, pan, jug, whatever you’ve got to put the meat into.,
Once you’ve got that done, grab and twist to separate the rib cage and guts from the rest of the carcass.,
Now, make a cut on either side of the back legs, above the hip bones (you’ll see the hip bones sticking out a little).",How to Gut a Squirrel," You may also want to have a good set of crock sticks to keep it sharp, and you may also want to have a set of pliers. Some fox squirrels have pretty tough bones in their legs. The pliers make it a lot easier to break those bones.;
, The reason for this is that you’ll get fewer hairs on the meat while cleaning.The wet hair doesn’t stick to the meat as easily as dry hair does.

, Make a cut up close to the base of the tail. Cut through the tail bones and skin the skin away from the flanks a little.

, Grab both back legs with a hand and give a good steady pull up. This will strip the skin off from better than half-way on forwards.

,, Work your finger/thumb through the area until it goes all the way through to the other side. Pull the skin out to the foot on each leg and pull the skin up to around the head.

, If the bones are too tough (as is sometimes the case on fox squirrels), use the pliers to break the bones. Once the bones are broke, use your knife and cut the front feet loose from the legs. Now all that’s left is the head (on the front half at least).Cut around the neck with your knife and give a good twist. The head and skin attached will break loose.

, Grab the little section of skin that’s left on the belly and start working it back. Usually, you can jerk the rest of the skin off by holding the squirrel behind the front legs and giving a pull on the skin. Pull it off to the feet again as done on the front.

, If you’re going to use the pliers, this is probably where you’ll need them. Break the bones in both legs and then cut the rest of the way off with your knife.

, Start at the end of the rib cage at the breast bone. Put just the tip of your knife in to avoid cutting any of the “innards” and making a mess. Cut toward the pelvic bone, a little at a time, avoiding the intestines and such.

, Once you get the belly and pelvic bone split, don’t bother with pulling the guts out. This is the easy way of cleaning a squirrel. You won’t need to gut the critter completely. Spread the back legs backwards toward the back like a butterfly to open up the belly area. Reach in and pull the intestines, any blood vessels and such loose from the back end of the squirrel. Pull the stuff loose up to about the diaphragm.

, Twist the leg a little so that you can see where the leg is attached to the torso. Cut the leg loose completely while like this. You’ll be able to see really easily where to cut. Do this with both front legs.

, Next, go to the back of the rib cage and make a cut right behind the last rib, all the way up to the backbone. Do this on both sides.

, Pitch the ribs and guts in your gut bucket.

, Cut all the way around, and then twist to separate the saddle piece (back) from the legs. Pitch the saddle piece with the front legs. Next, cut up on either side of the tail to separate the back legs from the backbone. Pitch the backbone piece in the gut bucket. Once you’re done, you’ll have 5 pieces of meat, the 2 back legs, the 2 front legs, and the saddle piece.

How many deer you can tag
What kind of deer you can tag
Other safety regulations, such as clothing essentials and hunting hours;
, While you don't need a firearm to go deer hunting, it is the most popular form of deer hunting. Go to your local law enforcement office and ask. Do exactly what is required of you to obtain a firearm. Do not fool around — follow the law! If you cannot handle a firearm for legal or medical reasons, consider bow hunting which is just as exhilarating as hunting with a firearm. Once you understand which permit(s) you need, apply accordingly.

, What you wear may seem trivial, but it can be more important than you think. When you're dealing with other hunters, trying to blend in, and sitting for long periods of time, what you decide to wear is a crucial decision.



Orange. Deer cannot see very well.If you'll be handing a firearm, be sure to check state regulations for how much orange you need to wear, which is required in most, if not all, states.

Camouflage. Complete the outfit with a nice combo of camo — both to blend in and to look cool. Depending on what season you'll be hunting in, you may want to vary the type of camo you use.

Hunting boots. Purchase a pair of Gore-Tex, 800-Gram of Thinsulate-Ultra Insulation, Cordura Nylon. The Gore-Tex makes your boots waterproof, the 800-Gram of Thinsulate will keep your feet warm, and the cordura Nylon is low maintenance compared to leather.

, Aside from your weapon of choice, your clothing, and your indefatigable pluck, you're going to need some equipment essentials when you go on your hunt. Here are the basics of what you'll need. You may want more based on personal preferences, but if you exhaust the following list, you should be good to go.



Hot seat. This will keep your rear warm as you sit in the woods. Get a thick foam hot seat. Sew a loop about eight inches long, fasten it to your hot seat and clamp it to the loop on the back of your pants. Use your hot seat only if the weather is very cold, or is raining or snowing… Some hunters just like to sit on something soft and warm…. By the way, you can stand on a hot seat if it is extremely cold.

Binoculars. Let's be honest: most of the time you'll spend ""hunting"" will actually be spent waiting. If you have a trusty pair of binoculars, you'll be able to spot the deer well before they're in range, leaving you prepared for the kill.

Rangefinder. A rangefinder can be extremely useful for making sure that when you finally do spot that deer, you don't miss your shot when it's time to take it.

Fanny-pack or Bum-Bag kit. Consider bringing a fanny pack with the following essentials: bug repellant, flashlight, knife and sharpening stone, small first-aid kit, compass, and a butane lighter.Get the correct weapon and ammunition. This is always important for when you hunt because if you shoot a deer with the wrong gun you get your licenses and permits taken away.

, If you're hunting for big bucks — why wouldn't you? — you got to know where to look. The thing is that big bucks are smart bucks. They've grown old for a reason: they tend to avoid human interaction and take pains to isolate themselves from potentially dangerous situations. Here are some pointers on where to look for deer:


Choose the densest, most inhospitable places for man to travel through. Where man does not tread, the deer may roam. Dense cedar thickets, old swampland, you name it; look for a trail and set up a stand.
Bigger bucks tend to bed and rest in shady, higher-altitude places. Here, they are most concealed and farther removed from threats like humans.
Thick creek bottoms are also more likely hideaways for big bucks. These places allow them to rest and drink water in a relatively isolated area.

, Sometimes, tree stands will be already set up for you. Most of the time, you'll need to set them up yourself. Scout various locations before and during the hunting season, as deer change their habits. Alterations in weather and human activity greatly impact in their environment.


There are several kinds of commercial tree stands that you can choose from. They include small, less expensive units, like hang-on tree stands and ladder tree stands, in addition to larger, more expensive units, like tripod tree stands as well as tower and box blinds.Build your own tree stand by hoisting a simple wooden platform high enough up onto a tall tree. What the tree stand looks like doesn't matter as much as how secure and high up it is.

, Baiting can be a good way to remind deer that a certain location is good territory, so to speak. Many states won't let you hunt within 300 yards (274.3 m) of bait so stop baiting a week or 10 days before you hunt.As far as bait, deer particularly like:


Corn
Apples
Carrots
Mineral licks
Sugar beets

, Hunting is more enjoyable with a group of responsible and dependable friends and family members. If you hunt alone there are a few things you need to do differently for safety reasons:


Always take a fully charged cellular phone.
Tell someone that you are going hunting and the time you plan to return and stick to your return time. Have someone check on you just to make sure you returned safely.
If you do not have firsthand knowledge of your hunting area you may want to carry a GPS device or do some research of the area such as purchasing a topographical map of the area and studying it; remembering that local landmark or stream could make that little difference if you should become lost.

, Scrapes, rubs, and game trails are signs of deer frequenting a particular area. Be sure to hunt in shooting range from signs.


Scrapes are spots in the ground that bucks have dug out during rutting season. The earlier you find scrapes in the hunting season, the more reliable indicator they are of good places to hunt.Rubs are abrasions made by rutting bucks who scrape their antlers against trees. The size of the rub is usually a good indication of the size of the buck.

, Deer have amazingly keen senses, especially hearing and their sense of smell. Masking your own scent is a good means of giving yourself a better shot at that trophy buck.


If you don't want to have to shell out beaucoup de bucks on cover scent, try using baking soda instead. Mix a tablespoon of baking soda with unscented soap and use it in the shower before the hunt. Put some in your boots; create a ""lasagna"" with your clothes by layering baking soda and clothes; you can even brush your teeth with baking soda if you're intrepid.Baking soda is an easy and cheap scent cover for all manner of hunter.

, Seasoned hunters will rely on myriad techniques to entice the deer over to where they're waiting. You have a number of different options:


Try using deer calls. Deer calls can be made using your own voice or can be produced mechanically by using a ""doe in estrus"" can. (""Estrus"" means a peak time for sexual receptivity.) Simply tip the can over with a quick folding wrist action to simulate the estrus bleat sequence.
Doe estrus scent. Use doe estrus spray or bring along a rag soaked in doe estrus urine to the hunt. In some cases, the buck will follow the scent of the doe straight to you.
Buck urine in the early season. Bucks get very territorial in the early season, especially when they're sparring. Covering your scent with or using buck urine in the early season can have its rewards.
Rattling antlers in the early season. Rattling antlers sends a sign that other bucks are sparring, which attracts bucks in the early season especially. Use this to lure bucks from far away.

, If you've covered your scent, made the appropriate calls, and sent out the right pheromones, there's a good chance your buck will pass a very short distance in front of you. Be patient. Shooting to kill is a lot easier when your deer is within 20 or 30 yards (18.3 or 27.4 m). Don't take a far-off shot; chances are you'll miss the deer's vitals, spook off all the rest of the deer, and only manage to injure it (causing a slow, painful death).

, While the deer is approaching, but before he's gotten close enough, try to stand up. This is the biggest movement you will take and has the highest likelihood of spooking the deer if you do it too late.

Standing is a very unstable position to shoot in. It is better to shoot in the prone, sitting, or kneeling position.







, It's very important to stay as quiet as possible immediately before shooting, otherwise you risk spooking the deer. This will often depend on what kind of weapon you're using to hunt.


If using a gun or crossbow, have your weapon fully loaded with the safety on. Then, all you need to do when you're ready to shoot is flip the safety off and pull the trigger. Don't be caught with your proverbial pants down and forget to load your weapon.
If the deer is still walking and won't stop for you to get a good shot, make a short bleat sound. This will catch the deer's attention, giving you time to shoot. You must be quick though because if you take a long time to shoot after bleating the deer will spook and run away.
If using a bow and arrow, be very methodical when you load your arrow in the draw. Try to stand up when bow hunting. It'll improve your form and won't limit the type of shots you can take., Place your shot right behind the front leg, 6 inches (15.2 cm) up from the chest. If hit properly, this shot will travel through the deer's vitals and kill it humanely. Other places to aim include the neck or the brain., Your goal as a responsible hunter is a one-shot kill; that way, the deer is felled quickly, without much pain and suffering. To check what kind of shot you got off, look at the blood on the ground near where you shot the animal. If the blood is:


Brown hair and pink blood, with air bubbles, you've probably hit heart or lung. That's great news. It means your deer is probably somewhere close and not going to suffer.
Brown hair and dark red blood, you've probably hit the deer farther back, possibly in the liver. Your buck may survive a while longer than you'd like, although it should still die relatively quickly.
White hair and thin or watery blood with bile or other stomach matter, you've possibly missed the one-shot kill. You may have to track the deer and deliver another kill shot to humanely eliminate it.

, Start off with this location. From here try to pick up a blood trail recall what general direction the deer was heading in when it ran away. With your compass, GPS, and a buddy, head out in this direction, taking note where you're going.


Try to wait 30 minutes before beginning to track the deer. This will give the deer a chance to lie down and possibly bleed out. If you follow the deer right away, adrenaline will kick in and the deer could travel much farther than he might otherwise., Look at the brush and foliage off to the side of the trail for any signs of where your deer might have gone. Here are some tricks to help you keep the blood trail in sight:


Use hydrogen peroxide in a spray bottle. Fill a spray bottle with hydrogen peroxide and mist an area lightly. Any blood will start to foam up, just like it does when you apply hydrogen peroxide to a cut.
Use fluorescent light. A handy fluorescent light will retail for $20 and make the job of spotting blood, especially at dusk or dawn, a lot easier.

, You may even want to call friend to help drag your deer out of the woods with you.

, Handling meat in the field is a craft, not something that can easily be learned from written directions. The majority of hunters learn from their mentor(s) and it is the preferred method for many reasons. Try to find an experienced hunting partner. Not only is is relatively unsafe to hunt alone, a hunting partner makes for a long, healthy friendship and they can help with tasks such as this.

, Respect the animal that gave up its life for you by using its meat and only taking as many tags as you need.

In the United States, hunting laws can differ from state to state, so research hunting laws in your state before leaving on your hunting trip.


Because, especially in agricultural communities, coyotes can be considered pests, and because they are not an endangered species, there are generally few restrictions on hunting coyotes. However, there are sometimes restrictions on the ways in which you are allowed to hunt coyotes. For instance, in West Virginia, though there is no limit on the number of coyotes you may hunt, only .22 caliber ammunition or smaller is legal for hunting coyote. If in doubt about which locations are safe and legal or hunting, visit the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's online hunting site locator, which allows you to search by state, zip code, and type of game.;
, Coyotes are common throughout most of North and Central America. Though they originally lived mostly in prairies, grasslands, and deserts, the coyote has now adapted to live almost everywhere - even in urbanized, metropolitan areas.The best bet for finding coyotes is to look for them where their wild prey (small game, birds, mice, etc.) live. Fields, brushy creeks, riverbeds, and light forests are all good places to hunt.Because they are livestock pests, most farmers will be happy to give you permission to hunt coyote on their agricultural land as well.

, Because coyotes weigh, at most, 50 pounds,you won't need a large-caliber weapon to bag one. In fact, as noted above, in some jurisdictions, it's illegal to hunt coyote with large-caliber weapons. Flat-shooting .22 rifles are fine choices for coyote hunting. In shorter-range situations, like in wooded areas or at night, shotguns can also work well (where legal). Deer-sized rifles will work fine in a pinch.


With shotguns, opt for a 12-gauge that has a tight spread at up to 35 yards (32.0 m).

, Coyotes have long had a reputation as cunning animals and are known to have keen hearing and eyesight. Unless they've become accustomed to human interaction, they are likely to flee when they hear you coming. Because of this, it's important to be as quiet as possible on your hunt. Below are a few easy ways to reduce the sound you make on your hunting trip:


Don't slam your car doors when you arrive on-site.
Try to reduce the noise that your equipment makes as you move with it. For instance, don't let two hard metallic objects (like the scope on your gun and your binoculars) clang together as you walk.
If you're hunting with partners, don't talk freely. If it's necessary to communicate, have your partners come next to you so that you can talk in a hushed voice or a whisper.
After you settle into a good position, stay still, getting up to move only when you have decided to try a new spot. Once you're in position, you may want to wait in silence for 5-15 minutes before making any calls., In addition to minimizing the amount of noise you make on your hunt, it's important to reduce your visual profile (and your scent) as much as possible. Use natural cover when it's available to you, staying behind hilltops, tree lines, and rock formations. Avoid places where you can be easily seen, like clearings and hilltops. When the wind allows, try to approach your hunting site from down-wind to minimize the chance of a coyote detecting your scent.


Finally, use natural and artificial obstacles, like cliffs, rivers, and roads to your advantage. Keeping these at your back guarantees that coyotes won't be able to circle behind you, or, if they do, they'll be highly visible.

, Though they can be elusive and crafty, like all animals, coyotes leave telltale signs of their presence. Coyote signs include:


Coyote tracks - small prints similar to those of a dog. Prints from the coyote's front feet, at about 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) long and 1.5–2.5 inches (3.8–6.4 cm) wide, are generally slightly larger than those of their back feet, which are about 1.75–3 inches (4.4–7.6 cm) long and 1.3–2 inches (3.3–5.1 cm) wide.Coyote calls - dog-like barks, howls, and yelps. Especially common at dawn and dusk.Coyote scats (droppings). Coyotes like to deposit small piles of their droppings in prominent places where other animals (and humans) are likely to find them.Scats may contain fur from recent kills.

, When hunting coyote, you'll want to find a well-hidden position where you comfortably remain still and stay on the lookout for upwards of half an hour at a time. Ideal shooting positions offer good cover, enough space for you to sit or lay comfortably, a clear view of the area in front of you, and/or a place to steady your gun. Look for rocky outcroppings, knolls, small ridges, or plant cover at the edge of a field. When you've found a good spot, settle in and stay quiet, scanning the direction from which you'll have the best shots at coyote.


Camouflage can help you keep yourself concealed from wary coyotes in your shooting position. Consider investing in a quality set of hunting camouflage before embarking on your trip.

, After you've settled into your shooting position, briefly stay still and quiet while remaining on the lookout for any signs of movement in the area in front of you. If nothing presents itself after about 15 minutes, use a call. Calls are small tools that imitate the sounds of certain animals - you should be able to find them at any hunting shop. For attracting coyotes, your best bets are to use calls that imitate the distress sounds of their prey and the communicative howls and yips of coyotes themselves.


Rabbit squealers are reported to work well,but you may also want to have a selection of other distress calls at your disposal, so you can cycle through them. Try to use calls that are appropriate for the location and time of year that you're hunting, based on the types of small prey that are common in the area.

, As with most types of hunting, coyote hunting is a waiting game. Be patient - coyotes are unlikely to show themselves immediately. After you make your calls, wait 15-20 minutes before making another. You may want to cycle through your different calls to test the effectiveness of each. Between calls, stay vigilant, looking for signs of movement.


If you don't seem to be having any success, wait 15 more minutes, then leave and proceed to another site. It's a hunting superstition that the prey presents itself right as the hunter is getting ready to leave.

, If you're having trouble luring coyotes into shooting range, consider using an artificial decoy (such as an old stuffed animal or a commercially-available decoy) or an actual dead animal (rabbits work well.). Place your bait or decoy an ideal shooting distance away from your hiding place, then return to your hiding place and wait. If possible, use a distress call that matches your bait or decoy.


If using a dead animal, you may want to cut it open to allow the scent of its innards to escape. This scent is especially strong and should, with luck, improve your chances of attracting coyotes.

, Though it is very unusual for hunters to kill coyotes for their meat, some prize their pelts for their softness and beauty. If you intend to hunt coyotes for their fur, plan on trying to kill every coyote with one, clean shot. This serves a dual purpose - not only will it minimize damage to the coat, but it minimizes the chance that the coyote will be able to run and hide before dying, wasting the kill and leaving you without a pelt.


For the best chance of killing the coyote quickly with one shot, aim for its vitals, specifically, its heart and/or lungs. A coyote's vitals are fairly far forward on its torso - its small heart lies in the lower portion of the torso just forward of the animal's forelegs, while its larger lungs are slightly above and behind the heart. A shot in the area above one of a coyote's forelegs is likely to hit one of these organs.

A shot to the head is also very likely to kill a coyote in one shot. However, coyotes' heads can be fairly small and hard to hit.


Even if you don't want a coyote's pelt (for instance, if you're simply killing the animal to eliminate a threat to your livestock), try to make a clean kill shot. Shots to an animal's vitals are the quickest, most humane way to kill an animal. Messy kills can prolong a dying animal's suffering.

, As you approach the coyote you've shot, look for signs of breathing or movement. A coyote that's wounded, but not completely dead, should be put out of its misery as quickly as possible with a bullet fired safely into its head (or, if you're very confident in your abilities, by slitting its throat). Be careful around wounded coyotes - though it's very, very unlikely for a full-grown person to be killed by a coyote (let alone a dying one), it may be able to inflict a bite.


If, by some chance, you are bitten by a coyote, get medical attention. Even if you're not seriously injured, you will want a doctor to ensure the bite didn't carry any disease.

, As with all game, time is a concern after killing a coyote, as its body will begin to attract bacteria after death. Nearly all hunting resources recommend field dressing a killed animal immediately after killing it for the best chance at preservation. Though there is no need to be frantic, if you're interested in taking a coyote's pelt, it's best to start field dressing or skinning the animal as quickly as you can to ensure its overall ""freshness"".


The weather and environment you hunted the coyote will make a difference in how quickly you need to move - generally, colder temperatures allow dead animals to ""keep"" for longer.

, Field dressing is a technique common to most types of game hunting which involves removing a dead animal's internal organs, leaving essentially only the meat, skeleton, and hide. Field dressing is done to eliminate the smell and mess of the animal's innards, to reduce the weight of the animal carcass, and to ensure the animal products most hunters are interested in - meat, hide, etc. - are as clean as possible. Field dressing can be done on the ground, though it may be much easier if the coyote is hung from a tree or sturdy pole. Once the animal's innards have been removed, you may remove its skin, or, alternatively, you can immediately hang and skin the dead coyote, leaving its carcass, organs and all. Whatever parts of the animal you leave in the field will rot or be eaten by other animals.


Coyotes, because they're small and light, loan themselves to easy skinning in the field. However, if you've field-dressed your coyote and you're hunting in cold weather or you can get its carcass into a cold place in a reasonably short amount of time, you can also transport the animal home to skin it.
However you choose to skin a coyote, be sure to carefully clean yourself afterward to prevent the spread of disease and/or parasites from the animal.

When do they drop their antlers? In Michigan, deer drop their antlers between late December and late January. Elk drop their antlers in late March to mid April.
Know what types of cover or locations the animals frequent during the time period that their antlers are shed.
Spend some time in the woods in the winter. Where do you see a lot of deer tracks? Deer and elk are like people. They don't like unnecessary effort. They will concentrate in areas that have food and are easy to get around in, like protected gullies and cedar stands near rivers and streams. This is especially true in areas with heavy snow.;
, This is an excellent way to spend your time during the hunting off-season.


Find a topo map. Look for low elevation areas that likely to be protected from wind and heavy snow in winter.






Talk to hunters and people that are in the woods a lot. Where are the deer in January? Where are the elk in April? It does not do much good to look for antlers where there were not deer or elk when the shed antlers dropped.







, You will usually find the most antler sheds by walking deer and elk trails.


Watch for areas that would cause an antler to fall off. Good places to look: Near fallen trees and branches on trails, on steep hills, and near thickets and thick cover that would catch on antlers. Also look where deer trails cross fences and roads. Whenever a deer or elk jumps, it may cause an antler shed to drop!

, You never know where you will find a shed. When you cross deer or elk trail intersections, look both ways down the trails.

, You may find one in the first five minutes of walking, or it may take you three trips to find one. Part of the fun of antler shed hunting is in the challenge.

, It's fun to show your friends the photo of a ""shed in the wild"". Kind of like a 'Where's Waldo?' game.

, Mark the location where the original antler was located. Often, the second antler will be relatively close to its partner. Search in a grid pattern, or circle the original antler in an expanding diameter in order to find the second antler.

, There are many ways to display shed antlers. Matched pairs can be displayed in an antler mount, or you may choose to wait until you have several sheds and make an antler chandelier or mirror frame. Single sheds also look great as rustic decoration in hunting cabins or on mantles, or weathered sheds may be made into knife handles or antler clothes buttons.

Work around each horn.,
Work around the top of the eye.,
Open the mouth of the animal and make a gum incision.,
Pack up the cape, skin-to-skin.,
Use a hacksaw to separate the skull plate.",How to Field Dress an Elk1," After you kill an elk, you need to get to work immediately to save the meat, but don't just jump in and start cutting away. For many hunters, the thrill of any big game kill is the trophy you'll get back from the taxidermist, meaning that you'll need to work carefully to keep the hide intact, giving yourself the best possible trophy.


If you’re not interested in saving the horns or the hide for trophy purposes, you don’t need to worry about caping. You can move directly to dressing the elk out if you want to take the whole carcass, or using the gutless method if you’re only interested in the meat.
Caping, dressing out, or gutting an elk isn't rocket science–it's an art form. The exact process will vary from hunter to hunter, so develop your own short-cuts and tricks of the trade to do what works best for you, the situation, and the animal you've downed.
Never attempt to cut the animal's throat to ""bleed it out."" This is an unnecessary practice and a common misconception when inexperienced hunters are dressing an elk, and you'll risk spoiling the cape. Work quickly and there's no need to bleed an elk.;
, With the right hunting knife, you can break down a whole elk relatively quickly, but you'll also need a foldable hunting saw to take with you and get through the rib-cage and the other tough bits. While it's possible to take most of the meat from an elk without using a rib-saw, you'll be making it a lot easier on yourself if you do. To be well prepared for all scenarios, when you're out hunting elk, it's a good idea to have:


A very sharp hunting knife, with sharpener. Hunting knives are typically fixed-blade, but are also available in foldable varieties. They need to be kept honed to a razor's edge to carefully separate the hide from the meat in the field, efficiently and smoothly. For this reason, it's good to have a sharpener with you, kept on an easy-to-access lanyard. Gerber, Spyderco, and Kershaw are all popular brands.
Foldable bone saws are also important for breaking down a large animal, like an elk. The best option is usually to get something like a Flip 'n Zip saw combo from Gerber, with a hunting blade and saw in tandem, but you can also shop around to find the best deal for you.

, For a good shoulder-mount, the whole cape will extend over the shoulders of the animal, down to about the middle of the front quarters, and back to the mid-brisket (the chest of the animal, just behind the shoulders).


Mark where the cape will end by making a small incision around the mid-point of the animal's front quarters, to draw a guide line, then cut from the back of each front leg up the animal's torso, pulling the hide up toward the skull as you work, like you're pulling off a sweater. It should all start coming off in one big piece. Start pulling the hide, using your knife to ease it off, around each leg, and start working it off the front chest area of the animal.

, To start, you'll need to work the blade of the knife up between the shoulder blades, straight up the back of the animal's neck. Using one hand, gather the hide and pull backward to avoid cutting into the meat, easing your blade up the back of the neck until you get to the antlers.


Use your knife to cut all the way around the animal's hide, perpendicular to your shoulder cut, around the torso just behind the shoulders. From here, you'll start working the hide off the shoulders, pulling it back and slipping it off like a jacket. Use your knife to scrape just along the white fatty tissue under the hide, being careful not to pull of and waste any meat. Continue working up toward the animal's skull.

, Make your between-the-shoulders incision extend toward one antler, cutting all the way until your knife touches. Using one hand, pull the hide up and use the flat of your blade to scrape as close to the bone as possible, gently tugging the hide back away from the skull. When you get to the horn, scrape around the base, pulling the cape of the hide up and away from them, gently. This should create a flap that you can use to separate the hide from the skull, keeping it in one piece.

, One of the more gentle parts of the job is skinning the face of the animal, so it's important to go slowly and gently. As you start to pull the hide loose from the face, hold the eyelid down with your finger to keep it from coming with you. This is the most difficult part of the job, so go slowly and use care.


Pull the hide back, folding the furry side in on itself and exposing the seam where the hide is attached to the skull, with fatty, waxy tissue. Work your knife into the crevices and the folds as you firmly pull the hide back and away.
Continue separating the hide from the face. Work the hide loose and pull the top section of the cape away. Work your knife down the front of the face, pulling it loose as you work.

, To pull the hide free from the face of the animal, open the lips and work your knife up around the gum line, cutting through until you can feel the knife hit bone. Go all the way around the mouth. As you continue working the hide off the front, under the jaw and down the face, you should be able to pull it free eventually.

, After you've pulled the cape loose, fold the skin-side in on itself, so the fur won't get messed up, and fold up the cape neatly and tightly as possible. It's usually best to pack it up into a plastic bag or some kind of sack loosely. Air circulation is important to dry things out and keep it from getting too damp.


When you get back to camp, keep the hide cool and dry. The worst thing that can happen to the hide is getting damp. If you notice condensation, unroll the hide and let it dry out before taking it to the taxidermist as soon as possible.

, To make your pack-out lighter, it’s common to only remove the skull plate, where the antlers are attached, and let the taxidermist use a false skull for the trophy.


Work your saw around the back of the skull, behind the antlers, straight down toward the eye sockets. Stop when you're just under the point at which the antlers attach to the skull. Remove the hacksaw, make another cut directly above the eye sockets, straight back under the antlers, meeting at the point where you stopped.
If you're in the backcountry, it's common to strap the antlers to your back, with the points facing away from you. This way, if you should trip and fall backwards, the sharp points on the big antlers will go into the ground, not your skin.

Find out the ID regulations in your area.,
Clean the ducks immediately after retrieving them.,
Age ducks 1-2 days at less than 40 °F (4 °C).,
Decide if you'll skin or pluck your ducks.",How to Field Dress a Duck1," In some regions, duck carcasses need an entire wing left on for identification purposes with the game warden, while other places allow you to retain the heads and entrails separately for ID. Since this affects how you'll dress out your birds, it's important to find out how they'll be checked if and when the game warden comes calling.


Duck hunting regulations vary widely. In some areas, you'll only be allowed to collect a certain number of duck per day, so it's a good idea to be up-to-date on the specific regulations in your area. Federal guidelines can be found here, while local regulations can be found on the website of the Department of Natural Resources or the Hunting and Finishing bureau in your state.;
, When you collect a duck, it'll have been floating around in pond water, rolling in the mud, and probably mouthed by your golden retriever for a couple minutes before you got to it. In other words, it's pretty dirty, and it's important to take a few minutes to clean it up a bit before packing it up or dressing it out to keep the meat from spoiling.Clean any dirt and fecal matter from the feathers, especially around the tail of the duck. Dry it thoroughly and pack it in a cooler, or start dressing it immediately, depending on your intentions. Below 40 F, a duck carcass will be fine for 3-5 days in clean conditions, without doing anything.
Locate the shot and keep track of it. The meat around the area the pellets(s) entered will be scorched and less than tasty. You'll need to be careful to remove any shot from the carcass, and to trim away any meat around the area later, so it's a good idea to clean it out now.

, Letting meat dry out some will intensify the flavor in the right ways, reducing gaminess and making your duck more tasty. In the right conditions, you can do this without dressing the bird out, or you can do it after you've skinned or dressed the bird. Either way is fine for a clean bird.


If the temperature is right, you can hang birds upside down by their feet to drain out, in a shed or garage, as long as it's cool enough. Otherwise, keeping them in plastic bins in the refrigerator is also fine, as long as there's enough air circulation.
Different hunters like to dress out the birds at different points in the process. If you're out and going to collect lots of birds, it's likely you'll want to breast them out in the field as quickly as possible to keep down on your baggage. Alternatively, it's perfectly fine to keep the ducks whole, get them on ice quickly, and wait a couple days before dressing them in the right conditions.

, Skinning a duck is much faster and easier, especially in the field. Depending on how you'd like to cook your duck, though, some people prefer to leave the skin on, which means a more time-intensive plucking process needs to happen. Both ways are perfectly acceptable and will be covered below.


It's sometimes better to skin diver ducks and ducks shot around salt water. The fatty skin can sometimes taste a little fishy and be orange-colored, if the duck has consumed a lot of shellfish.
It's fine to pluck all others kinds of ducks, if you want to take the time. Foodies and gourmands agree: cooked properly, the crispy skin of a roast duck can be one of the most desirable parts of the meal. The skin is especially fatty, meaning that it can imbue the meat with lots of flavor. If you can take the time to save the skin, many people think it's well worth it.

You can either remove the head completely at this point to facilitate blood draining out, or you can wait until you've started skinning.

If you're harvesting a farm rabbit, it's common to use a blunt object like a rolling pin, broomstick, or other device to strike the animal at the base of the skull, or to dislocate the animal's neck with your hand. Dislocating is easier, because it eliminates the possibility of a missed strike, common for beginners. Holding the rabbit by the hind legs with one hand, grasp the animal with your other on either side of the head, pulling both hands away from each other firmly, twisting the head up and back to dislocate the neck. The animal will become unconscious immediately if done properly.;
, Before skinning the rabbit, it's common to remove the head with a heavy knife, laying the rabbit flat on a cutting surface and inserting the knife at the base of the skull where it meets the neck. Push through with a firm chop. Hang the rabbit from it's hindquarter, just under the hock to drain into a bucket.


You can pierce the rabbit's hind leg into the Achilles tendon to hang it upside down, just under the hock (the big part of the hind leg, like the thigh).
There's some discussion about how necessary it is to bleed out a rabbit you're planning on eating. Because there's not a lot of blood to drain from a rabbit, some hunters skip this step and remove the head during the skinning process. Bleeding out will, however, result in ""cleaner"" looking and in some cases more tender meat if you bleed the rabbit immediately after killing it.

, You can dress the rabbit more or less immediately after killing it, and since it's usually easier to remove the skin while the rabbit is still somewhat warm, it's recommended to dress rabbits as soon as you get the chance. If that doesn't happen until you get home, that's fine, though the rabbit will usually be more difficult to work if it's gone cold and stiff. The whole process shouldn't take more than a few minutes.


Since rabbit season is usually during cold weather, there's less of a need to hurry and worry about spoilage. Because it'll likely be chilly, your rabbit carcasses should be fine until you get home if you'd rather wait. You might consider doing it in the field, though, to leave the mess in the great outdoors.

, While it's always best to field dress your rabbit immediately after killing it to reduce the risk of contaminating the meat, it's also important to work clean. Even if you're in the middle of the woods, use a sharp, clean hunting knife free of rust and other contaminants, and rinse the carcass with clean water when you're finished.


It's a good idea to wear latex or thick rubber gloves while handling your rabbit, especially when you're handing the entrails. Keep your hands clean and your meat clean.
Some hunters like to keep a cutting board specifically for the purpose of field dressing small game like rabbits and squirrels. Clean it thoroughly before and after use with soap and clean water, making especially sure there's no fur or other contaminants on the surface as you work.

, There's no meat in the feet, and it'll be easier to get the hide off if you remove the feet first at the ankle knuckle. They can be removed quickly and easily, and it's better to do it now than when you're haggling with the hide half-on and half-off.


To remove them, bend each foot forward, making a small cut across the back of the knuckle to loosen the joint.
Use your knife to cut through the rest of the way with a firm cut through with your knife. You shouldn't have to use much pressure to cut through.

, Pinch the skin near the shoulder blades of the rabbit to lift the skin up and away from the muscle, and make a small incision from side to side, perpendicular to the backbone. It only needs to be long enough to get your fingers in.


Be very careful to pull the skin up before piercing it. You don't want your knife to cut through into the meat yet, because it's easy to carry bacteria or parasites off the fur and into the flesh, contaminating things and ruining all your work.

, Use your first two fingers from each hand to insert into the hole you've made in the hide, using one hand to pull toward the tail and one hand to pull toward the head. Keep working the skin off until it's just connected at the neck.Rabbit skin comes off quite easily, slipping off the muscle like a jacket. It's quick work. You shouldn't have to work a knife in, as with a deer or other larger game, and you shouldn't have to pull very hard.
If you're interested in saving the pelt and keeping it in one piece, it's better to make a longer incision in the belly after removing the feet, near the pelvis of the rabbit, then slip it back off the legs and up the back. This isn't the most recommended method for beginners, since it risks piercing the belly cavity and the entrails, spoiling the meat, but it's not hard once you get the hang of it.

, Now the skin should be draping off the carcass, connected at the neck. With one hand, grab the rabbit by the back legs, letting the head and the skin hang toward the floor. With your other hand, gather the skin around the head, and twist it off firmly, rotating the body and the head in opposite directions. It should come right off.You can also remove the head with your knife by cutting firmly and quickly through the back of the neck, under the skin.
If the tail didn't come off when you removed the skin from the butt-side of the rabbit, you can also cut it off now, as close to the body as possible.

, Pinch the skin to raise it up off the organs underneath, and make an incision with you knife so you can remove the organs very carefully. Pinch the skin up as high as you can, and make your incision, then insert two fingers to keep lifting the skin up and away as you keep slitting the belly open, up to the rib cage.


When you reach the rib cage, you'll also need to cut through the breast bone to open up the cavity and expose the organs on top. You should be able to run your knife up through the break through the ribs easily.
Rabbit skin is quite transparent, so you should be able to see the organs underneath quite clearly at this point. What you want to be very careful to avoid specifically is the urine sac and the colon, either of which will ruin the meat, if pierced.
Be prepared for some odor. The body-cavity of a wild rabbit won't smell like petunias. It's not indicative, however, of anything wrong with the meat.

, Up toward the ribcage, you'll notice a small transparent membrane keeping the heart, liver, and other major organs intact. At the very top of the ribs, you might need to cut through the membrane to remove it slightly to make the organs come out more easily. This isn't always necessary, but it'll make it much easier to let gravity do the work of removing the organs for you.

, With one hand, pick up the carcass of the rabbit, so the back feet are pointing at the ground. With your other hand, insert two fingers at the very top of the ribcage and scoop the organs out with a gentle but firm downward motion. They should fall right out with the help of gravity, preferably into a bucket for easy clean-up.


Some hunters like to pay special attention to removing the urine sac before the rest of the organs, especially if it appears to be quite full. The urine sac looks like a small pale yellow balloon, near the anus. To remove it, pinch it firmly where it connects to the carcass, and only where it connects, then pull it away, being very careful to avoid squeezing it and popping it., The heart, liver, and kidneys are all common edibles. You can roast them up along with the carcass if you're interested, or they make great dog treats when cooked up, or raw.


It's good practice to examine the liver for any spots of discoloration after you remove it. Yellowish liver spots can be a sign of serious infectious disease, indicative of meat you don't want to eat. If you notice strange spots on the liver, discard the rabbit immediately.

, Immediately rinse the carcass in cold, clean water. This will help to bring the temperature down and prevent spoilage, as well as to remove any stray bits of fur, blood, or other bits from the inside and outside of the meat.


If you're in the field, pack the meat loosely in a cooler. Don't wrap it in plastic yet until it's cooled down fully, or it'll sweat and promote spoilage. The carcass should be maintained at a temperature not exceeding 39 degrees F (4 degrees C).
If you want to tan the hide, rinse the fur off immediately and soak it in cold water to keep it safe before beginning the tanning process.You can bury the entrails and fur if you want, or pack them out and dispose of them quickly. In some municipalities, however, it is illegal to leave entrails in nature. Check your local laws to know for sure.

, After you've let the carcass cool down sufficiently, you can start breaking it down further and preparing it for the stew pot, skillet, or the oven. The first thing to do is to carefully go over the carcass and remove any undesirable bits of sinew and fat with your knife.


Rabbit fat doesn't taste particularly good. A lean meat, rabbit is generally best prepared as clean as possible.
The skin comes off quite easily during the dressing because of a fine layer of silverskin that coats the meat. This is ok to leave on if you want to fry up your rabbit and crisp it up, but it's usually better to take some time to remove it. Peel the silverskin off carefully with your knife and dispose of it.

, Rabbit legs, especially the back legs, can account for up to half of the meat in a rabbit. It's one of the most-desired parts of the meat, tender, rich, and delicious.



To remove the front legs, run your knife along the ribs of the rabbit, up from under the front legs. They're not attached by bone, which makes them quite easy to remove.

To remove the back legs, splay the carcass on its back and bend the legs out to each side to expose the connecting joint. You might need to use your knife to scrape alongside the pelvic bone, between the leg and the pelvis to expose it. Use the point of your knife to separate the joint and pull each leg free.

, Because rabbits are small, this step is commonly skipped among people preparing rabbits. If you've got a big one, though, separating the meat from the torso beneath the ribs (this is the bacon of the rabbit) from the loin, the meat running on either side of the backbone, can yield delicious individual cuts.To remove the belly meat, flip the carcass on its back and trim the thin meat from the back, near the pelvis, forward to the ribcage. The point at which the meat gets slightly thicker and darker along the backbone is the loin.

To prepare the loin, it's usually common to leave intact, and separate from the ribcage by chopping through the backbone where it meets the ribcage. You can also just bend the loin backward from the ribcage with a firm twist to break it. The ribs can be saved for the stockpot, if you want, or discarded, since it contains very little meat.

, There's nothing that shouts hunter more than a whole rabbit roasted over an open fire on a spit. Don't want to go to all the trouble of breaking the carcass down? Don't. If you've got an especially small rabbit, it can be much easier to leave it intact and cook it up as one piece, rather than breaking it down into extremely small pieces.


Alternatively, it's also common to do a super-quick half-breakdown by chopping through the backbone right where the ribs meat the abdomen, separating the rabbit into essentially two pieces. This is an excellent way to braise the rabbit, or use it as a base for soup.

, If you're interested in trying rabbit, but aren't a huge fan of its particularly gamey flavor, bringing the rabbit in a salt-water overnight can do a lot to soften the flavor and make it much similar to chicken.


Use 1 tablespoon of salt for every cup of cold water you use to create the brine, then soak the rabbit in a covered bowl in the refrigerator overnight. However you choose to cook it, it'll be delicious.
Consider adding crushed red pepper, chopped basil or oregano, and crushed garlic to your brine to kick things up a notch.

, Rabbit is lean and gamey, a delicious alternative to more common grocery store meats, especially when cooked properly. It's perfect for stews and for frying up as an alternative to chicken, though there are lots of ways to cook rabbit:



Cook Italian-style rabbit. While we may not think of it as traditional ""Italian food,"" rabbit is commonly enjoyed in Italy, stuffed with fragrant spices and simmered in tomatoes and red wine. It's delicious and unexpected.
Make roast rabbit. Marinade your rabbit in a mixture of mustard, olive oil, and black pepper and brown the pieces in butter to create a nice crust on the meat. Finish the rabbit by roasting at 425 F for about ten minutes. It'll be tender and delicious.
Slow-cook the rabbit in a crock pot for 6 hours for super-tender eating. Add vegetables like carrots, onions, water chestnuts, and whatever else you like with some water. Thicken the sauce with a slurry of sherry and cornstarch in the last 45 minutes. You've got to try it.

, Some hunters who harvest a lot of rabbits have gotten field dressing down to a super-fast skill that only involves a minimal use of the knife. You can remove the hind legs and the backstraps or loin of the rabbit quickly by skinning the hind parts first. Then, tuck the skin in and tear the hind-quarters away from the rest of the animal. You'll be left with the most-desirable meat on the rabbit, and all the fur, guts, and forelegs in another pile, if you do it correctly.Hold the rabbit upside down by the hind legs and start by making a small incision across each hind leg. Start pulling the skin of each leg down toward the rabbit's groin, as if hiking up its trousers. Hook your finger through the skin of at the groin to tear through, separating it around the legs and work the skin up to around the ribcage.
When the hind-parts of the rabbit are bare, take the skin and tuck it into the skin remaining on the rabbit's upper chest. Grasping firmly around the mid-section, rip the top half of the rabbit down while pulling up on the hind legs. It'll take some elbow grease, but you can pull the back legs and the spine free of the rest of the carcass, leaving you with the best part, totally clean.

, One of the most, uh, colorful ways of dressing out a rabbit was introduced to the world in an old Air Force survival manual. You don't even need a knife.After killing the rabbit, hold it upside down, with the belly facing you. Feel where the ribcage ends on the belly of the rabbit, and grasp it with both hands, firmly squeezing your thumbs in where the ribs end.
Stand with your legs spread, more than shoulder-width apart, and ""toss"" the rabbit back through your legs as if you were long-snapping a football to a punter, without letting it go. Throw hard. As you toss, squeeze hard on the abdomen of the rabbit.
If done properly, the entrails will exit the rabbit's anus in quick fashion, and you can peel the skin off with your fingers, to have a fully dressed-out rabbit in about 30 seconds. If done improperly, you'll have a disgusting and ruined mess. There's no reason to do this if you have a knife.

, Many hunters are interested in getting the field dressing done with as quickly as possible. If you hunt a lot of rabbits, field dressing can quickly become tedious. The more you hunt, the more quick-tips you'll be able to come up with for yourself to speed up the process. Just make sure you've got a sharp and clean hunting knife, and find what works best for you. Always take the time you need to do the job, properly, though. There's no sense in rushing and ruining your meat.


Domestic rabbits tend to be more difficult to work because of their fat content, making it important to slow down and use care in the process. You don't want to ruin the meat by getting impatient.

Use this method when you’re close to camp.,
Make your first incision just below the sternum.,
Insert your fingers and feel for the membrane.,
Continue cutting all the way down to just above the anus.,
Use a saw to separate the ribcage.,
Make small cuts to separate organs from the cavity walls.,
Split the pelvic arch to remove the bladder and rectum.,
Drain the carcass and pack it out.",How to Field Dress an Elk2," When you're dressing out an elk, you've got to decide whether or not you want to take the bones with you. If you do, it helps to be close to camp, to make the moving process a lot easier. To start the process, you need to get the meat cooling down as quickly as possible by opening up the cavity and removing the internal organs.


Elk are extremely heavy animals, making it difficult to drag a whole carcass back to camp, if you're in the back country. For this reason, it's common to just harvest the meat, leaving the bones and the guts in the field. This method is discussed in the following section.

, Start just below the sternum, where the layer of hide and muscle gives you the most space from the guts. Use one hand to pinch the hide and pull it up and away from the ribs, using your other hand to make a small incision with the knife just under the sternum. Make the cut shallow, but make sure it's deep enough to get through the hide and into the membrane below, which attaches to the tissue below.


Listen for a whoosh of air or a hissing sound, which is a sign that you've punctured the stomach. If you have, this means you need to work very quickly to get the cavity open and get the stomach out of there, to avoid tainting the meat. It'll be fine as long as you work quickly and carefully, and rinse it off when you're finished., Elk hide is thick, and the muscle is thicker. Below that, you’re still not all the way to the organs, but the final layer separating them from your knife–and from spoiled meat–is a thin membrane, which you can feel for with your fingers. Pull upward, to separate the membrane, muscle, and hide from the organs and give your knife enough clearance to work.

, When you've got your fingers between the membrane and the muscle, you can pull the hide up and away, insert your knife, and work it down safely, knowing that you won't be cutting through into the guts. Be very careful of your fingers, working slowly and smoothly. Continue making your incision straight down the belly until you get just above the anus. You should stop when you can feel your knife touching the pelvis arch, the bone near the hips of the animal.


If you've got a bull elk, cut around the penis, just deep enough to separate it from the skin. Do not cut the urethra that leads to the bladder or pull it loose. Instead, cut it free and let it hang. This and the bladder will all come out together later with the rest of the guts.

, You don’t need to worry about puncturing anything in the upper-half of the animal. The best tool for this job is a combination hunting saw and knife, like a Gerber E-Z saw. These are small, portable, and lightweight, making them ideal for backcountry work. Use the toothed edge to work in between the seam, where the ribs connect and close the chest cavity, then pull the ribcage apart to open up the interior and work.


When you get to the top, it's also a good idea to go ahead and separate the wind-pipe at the neck. You can be sure that everything is separated on the inside and you can just start pulling things loose and discarding them (or saving what you want).

, There's no big secret to gutting the animal at this point–just start pulling the ""train"" loose and making small cuts along the abdominal walls to separate them, where they're attached, if necessary. Everything, for the most part, should come out in one big clump, which you can start piling between the animal's back legs as you work, being careful not to puncture anything.


Don't cut through the intestines to separate them. The intestinal tract of the animal will probably still contain feces, which will spoil your meat. Pile the innards between the hind legs of the animal and move to the next step to separate them safely.

, Special care needs to be taken to avoid accidentally puncturing the intestines or the bladder, which will expose the meat to waste and spoilage. To do this, you'll need to split the pelvic arch and expose them more readily. Use the hacksaw or a hatchet to remove a chunk from the top of the pelvic bone and open up space to work the intestines free safely.


Insert your thumb into the anus and use the knife to cut around your thumb. You can use a zip-tie to secure it and keep any waste from coming out, then pull the intestines up and free from the inside of the carcass. A plastic plug called a ""Butt Out"" is also available to do this, if you're uncomfortable playing elk proctologist..
If you've left the penis intact, the bladder should now come loose easily, along with everything else. Be very careful not to let it split or pop as you're working. Handle it gently and you should be fine.

, The cavity will likely be fairly damp and bloody, but it should be starting to cool down efficiently at this point. Some hunters like to turn the carcass over to allow it to drain some, promoting drying and cooling more effectively. If it's possible, you can hang the carcass and rinse it out with clean water if you're close enough to camp to have some to spare.


Elk are extremely heavy. Even if you’re very close to camp, it’s usually best to break it down some, separating the hindquarters from the torso, just under the ribs, making it easier to pack out. Alternatively, you can also separate the meat and leave the bones in the field. It won't take long.

"
"
Use this method for backcountry hunting.,
Settle the carcass onto one side.,
Score the hide around each leg joint.,
Find the seam in the meat along the hindquarter.,
Remove the backstraps.,
Remove the meat from the front-quarters.,
Go back and remove meat between the ribs.,
Carefully remove the tenderloin.,
Flip the carcass over and repeat on the other side.",How to Field Dress an Elk3," If you're just after meat, there's no reason to take a bunch of heavy bone back with you. There's a lot of meat on an elk, meaning there will be enough weight to pack out without fiddling around with bones. If you've got a long hike ahead of you, getting the good-quality meat is possible with the right tools and the right approach.With a sharp hunting knife, you should be able to break down an entire elk, just taking the meat, in an hour or two, plenty quick to avoid spoilage. Keep a couple of big plastic garbage bags on hand to get the meat into quickly and get it cooled down.

, Basically, you'll take all the meat you can from each side of the animal separately, working your way from the back to the front. After you've cleaned one side, you can flip the animal over to the other side. It won't matter that the skinned side is getting dirty, since you've already taken all the meat you want from it. It's quick and clean.

, Start working the hide off the hind leg on the side facing up by making a small cut around the lower joint below the ham. Pull the hide away from the meat, working your knife underneath to help unzip the hide and pull it loose as directed in the first section. Keep working until you've exposed the meat on the entire hindquarter.

, You don't have to be an anatomist or a licensed butcher to see where the good meat is. Trim away any fatty layer along the outside of the meat to get a good look at the ham that you've got. There should be a seam, where the major thigh muscle separates from the other leg muscles, providing a nice seam to work down and separate your first big roast or ham of meat from the carcass.


Work carefully, using your hunting knife to make small, clean cuts along the seam, pulling the meat loose in a big chunk as you work. Work down as close as possible to the bone as you can, taking as much as possible. This is some of the best meat for roasting or cutting into steaks on the elk. It's all good.
Most of the cuts should just be through membrane, making it relatively easy and quick. Around the pelvis though, keep your knife flat against the bone to work the meat loose and you should be fine.
You should spend the most time working at removing meat from the hindquarters. The most meat you'll get out of the animal will be there. Keep looking for the seams that separate muscles, cutting down until you get close to the leg bone, then pulling the meat loose. Place it directly into plastic bags.
Continue skinning up the carcass. As you work up the animal, continue skinning as you go, working the hide up and pulling it back to expose the seam, working your knife along to loosen it.

, Work the hide back over the backbone to expose it and remove the backstraps, which are like the outside tenderloin of the elk. These are two long ""straps"" of meat that run along each side of the backbone. You may only be able to get to the backstrap on the side you're working on, depending on how the animal is oriented, but if you know where to look for it, it's some of the best meat to get.


Feel the side of the animal, where the ribs end, then trace upward until you get to the backbone. The backstrap should start about there, and extend all the way along the backbone. To get at it, insert your knife and keep it flat against the backbone, then cut along it, keeping tight into the bone, up toward the shoulders and back toward the pelvis. Separate the backstrap from the pelvis, and at the top near the shoulder blade.
Find the seam several inches down the ribs of the animal to separate the backstrap completely. It forms a kind of ""trough"" along either side of the backbone, which you should be able to feel bulging slightly. It's about an inch or two deep and maybe five or six inches wide, running from the shoulder to the pelvis.

, There won't be as much meat from the front quarters are there will be along the back, but there's still a substantial amount. Work the hams off, finding the seams and separating the meat between the muscles. Work your knife until you hit the shoulder bone and separate your flank steak in a long strip.


It's also a good idea to work your knife up along the side of the neck to get the neck meat from that side. There's a lot of it. This is excellent for stewing and slow-cooking.

, Because elk are so big, it's surprisingly easy to get the meat from the ribs without having to bother removing the ribs themselves. You can work your knife along the bone, using each rib as a guide, and separate the meat the connects them. Go slowly and carefully, making sure that you don't push your knife into the carcass too far. Remember, the guts are still in there, making it very important that you work carefully and gently.

, The tenderloin is the meat that runs opposite the backstrap, along the inside of part of the backbone. It's the best meat on the animal, but it's also the most difficult to get to using this method. It's worth getting, though, every time.


Carefully push down the membrane separating the intestines from the last foot or so of ribs, where the backstrap ended. Holding the intestines down, and using extreme caution, use your knife to separate the tenderloin from the backbone, using the bone as a guide and letting your knife do the work. Be extremely careful.

, On a cool day–around 40 F or less–you can pack out all your meat in plastic bags and get it back to your camp to continue cooling down as quickly as possible. On hotter days, it may be a better idea to cool things down more actively.The biggest cause of spoilage is body heat, and not getting the meat cooled down quickly enough. If the temperature is higher than 70 F, you might want to rinse the meat in cool water to bring the temperature down before packing it out.


Aging meat helps to dry it out and improve the flavor. Elk is no different. While you want to get it cooled down as quickly as possible, in temperatures of less than 60 °F (16 °C), the meat should be fine for up to three days. Then cool it below 40 F for up to a week or two.

Remove the feet with clippers.,
Remove one or both wings, if you don't need to keep them on.,
Feel for the breast-bone with your finger.,
Use your hands and tear in opposite directions, firmly and smoothly.,
Peel the skin back.",How to Field Dress a Duck2," Start by clipping off both feet as close as possible to the body as possible, using wire cutters or a sharp knife. It usually works best to use something with a scissor-action, so you can lop them off quickly and cleanly.


Some people choose to toss the feet, but you can hang on to them and use them for making stocks and broths if you want to be especially resourceful.

, With your clippers, clip the joint where the wing meets the body, as close as possible. Then, use a sharp knife to run along and separate the rest of the skin connecting the wing to the body. Then, do the same thing to the other wing.


Alternatively, you can also clip the wings at the middle joint, just after the long feathers end, if you want to retain the top-most connective tissue where the wing meets the body. There's not much meat there, but there is some. If you do this, clip the joint, then run your knife back down along the wing toward the bird's ""armpit.""
If you want to skin your bird in the field, but need to leave the wings on for ID purposes, read the section called ""Breasting Out Ducks Quickly."" You can skin the duck, but leave the wings on very easily.

, On a sturdy, flat surface, lay the duck down on its back and feel for the breastbone. The easiest way to start peeling the skin away is to start with your fingers, just where the bone pokes up.


You don't have to pluck the feathers before you do this, but some hunters prefer removing some of the chest feathers to get out of the way before you start skinning. That's fine, but you'll only need to remove a few before you can get a finger on the skin, making it easier to do all at once.

, It's likely you'll have to dig in there, and you'll probably pull some feathers free before you get the hang of it. That's fine, just try to get a finger on the skin itself and start to open it up. Pull the skin in opposite directions, like you were removing it's jacket.


Alternatively, some like to hold the duck so the back is facing your chest, and use the tips of the fingers to tear into the skin and peel it back, like you were opening your shirt. This is usually a better method when you're out in the field, since you won't be able to lay the bird down on the ground, probably.

, Since you've removed the wings and the feet, you can pull the skin all the way off the bird, except around the neck. Once you've opened up the skin on the chest, keep peeling it back, over the ""shoulders"" where the wings met, and off the bottom around the tail. The tail feathers should stay stuck to the bird.


You shouldn't have to use a knife, though the skin is a bit stickier than rabbit skin on most ducks. Try to use as smooth a pull as possible.

"
"
Remove the feet and wings as before.,
Pull large flight feathers and tail feathers in the direction of growth.,
Remove the smaller torso feathers against the grain.,
Heat water and paraffin wax in which to dip the birds and remove the down.,
Dunk the duck.,
Peel the wax away from the skin.",How to Field Dress a Duck3," Use your clippers and your knife to remove the feet and the wings to give yourself a smaller area with which to pluck. If you need to save the wings or other parts of the duck for ID, later, do so.


Alternatively, if you're plucking, some hunters like to leave the feet on to hold onto during the plucking process. It's up to you. You can always remove them later, if you wish.

, There's not much of a secret to removing the outer layer of large feathers: just start plucking. They'll be tenacious, so you might just need to pull them one at a time, or a few at a time, pulling them straight out from the carcass.

, Smaller feathers are more quickly plucked several at a time, working from the bottom of the bird up toward the neck, against the grain. If you've got the right leverage and the right amount of elbow grease, you can get these feathers off a lot more quickly with some practice. Use your thumb and forefinger to start ripping them back and off.


You won't be able to remove all the feathers this way. You'll be left with a fine layer of super-soft downy feathers that are next-to impossible to remove by hand. Collect all the rest of the feathers in a bag for easy removal. They're also excellent for stuffing and other projects.

, In a large pot, boil enough water in which to submerge the duck, and melt in a block of paraffin wax, available at most grocery stores and other outlets. It should float in a layer right on top of the hot water. When you're ready, remove the water from the heat.


Use one package or block of paraffin wax per duck. It's likely you won't need to really boil the water to melt the wax, so keep a close eye on it. When the wax is melted, the water is fine and you're ready to dunk the birds.

, Quickly and gently dunk the bird through the layer of wax floating on top of the water, then immediately submerge the duck into a bucket of cold water to set the wax firmly. You don't need to soak the bird for longer than a couple of seconds, and in fact it's better to do it quickly. Before you've removed the entrails, it's important not to heat up the carcass too much, or you'll risk some spoilage.Immediately after pulling the duck from the hot wax bath, dunk it into a bucket of cold water to set the wax. You can let the duck sit in the cold water for a minute or two while the wax sets up, but it should happen very quickly.

, Now, there should be a hard crust of wax around the duck, which you can peel away to remove the downy under feathers. Squeeze the bird around the midsection to crack the wax and peel away the chunks in as large a portions as possible. The under skin should look very clean, like a chicken you bought at the store.

"
"
Remove the head.,
Remove the tail.,
Make an incision into the side of the bird, under the rib.,
Trim away the meat around the shot.,
Store the meat properly.",How to Field Dress a Duck4," As you peel the skin up toward the neck, you'll have to remove the head before the skin will come off entirely without tearing. Peel the skin back to expose the point at which the neck meets the body, and use your clippers to cut as close as possible to the body and remove the head.

, After you remove the skin from around the torso of the duck, the tail feathers will likely be stuck on, attached to a small ring of fat around the base of the carcass. Use your clippers to cut the feathers off, cutting right through and removing that ring of fat from the rest of the bird.

, There's no meat south of the rib-line of the duck, so the best way to remove the entrails is usually to cut around the base of the breast, underneath the rib, to separate the cavity with the entrails from the good meat. Run your knife up along the bottom of the breast plate, making smooth and shallow cuts. When you get to the other side, grasp the lower portion of the bird and pull firmly to remove the entrails. The intestines should come out in one clean go.


You can remove the heart and liver separately, which might stick up in the body cavity, and remove the gizzard from above. You can eat the liver if you remove the bile duct, which is greenish in color, kind of like an gel-cap pill. The heart is also edible, but somewhat small.
Alternatively, some hunters prefer to remove the gizzard from the top of the duck and remove the rest of the entrails from that cavity. It's a smaller space to work with, however, and farther away from the intestines, which need to be removed with care to avoid spoilage.

, Examine the meat on the bird. There should be a scorched-looking section, where the pellets entered the carcass. This will need to be removed, because it will taste ""off."" Remove any shot from the meat very carefully, and discard the scorched meat.


To finish off the dressing process, clean the meat and remove any remaining feathers and dirt stuck on. You can run the meet under some cool water, or simply clean it off with a clean towel. The loose feathers can be tenacious.

, Duck meat needs to be kept in a cool, dry place, preferably around 40 °F (4 °C). Wrap your meat loosely in butcher paper and store in a cooler, when you're in the field, until you can get it back to the refrigerator. It should be fine for about a week.


If you've got a lot of meat and you want to freeze some immediately, Ziplock freezer bags are the best method. Pack duck meat loosely into meal-sized portions and label them with the date. Frozen duck meat should be good for six months to a year in the proper conditions.

Get your hands on some saltpeter.,
Obtain charcoal.,
Get elemental sulfur.,
Finely grind the ingredients.,
Measure out the gunpowder components.,
Mix the ingredients together.,
Consider adding water.,
Store the black powder safely.",How to Make Gunpowder," Saltpeter is the common name for potassium nitrate. In the days when black powder was widely used, saltpeter was manufactured from bat guano or made from horse urine and other ""manure soils.""It's used in many fertilizers, as part of science projects, and in certain recipes. You have several options for sourcing saltpeter:









Look for ""stump remover"" in garden stores. Saltpeter is often sold under this name. You may also find it labeled as saltpeter, niter, or potassium nitrate.Buy it online. If you do a search for saltpeter, you'll get plenty of results, and you can easily have a bottle delivered to you.

Make it yourself out of a cold pack. Cold packs which can be bought for a few dollars to help with sore muscles contain sodium nitrate and water, and can be used to make saltpeter.
Make it with urine. This is definitely the most difficult way to source saltpeter, but some black powder enthusiasts prefer to make their powder entirely from scratch. To do so, one process is to fill a drum with manure affixed with a drain, valve, and filter at the bottom. Urinate into it, then top it off with water. After about 10 months, dry it out on trays.;
, You can use standard charcoal that you buy to cook with your grill, which you'll need to grind to a fine powder. If you're a purist, make your own charcoal by filling a metal drum with 3-inch pieces of willow or another wood, then placing the drum in a bonfire with a loose lid on top (to allow for airflow). Keep the bonfire piping hot for 4-6 hours, then open the drum. The wood will have charred into fine pieces of homemade charcoal, perfect for use in gunpowder.








, This naturally-occurring substance is often used to acidify soil, so you can find it in garden stores or from online sources that sell garden supplies. Elemental sulfur occurs naturally and is mined from beds in Texas, Louisiana, Italy, and other locations around the world.







, Use a mortar and pestle to grind each ingredient into a fine powder. Grind each ingredient separately, cleaning the mortar and pestle in between uses.









You can use a ball mill to grind the components if you're planning on making a lot of gunpowder. A ball mill is used to both grind and mix powders safely.

, Using the right ration of ingredients is very important when you're making gunpowder. Calculate the percentage by weight, using a small scale to weigh the different ingredients. Here's how much you need:









74.8% saltpeter
13.3% charcoal
11.9% sulfur

, Moistening the powders before mixing is the safest but not only procedure.Place them all in the mortar, moisten for safety, and grind them together with the pestle for 10 minutes or longer. If you're using a ball mill, mill the charcoal and sulfur together for 4 hours first, then add the saltpeter and mill the mixture for another 24 hours.









Be extremely careful around the black powder once it has been mixed. Do not smoke or light a flame anywhere close to the powder, and keep it away from heat.

, Some say adding up to 8% water can improve the gunpowder's burning. Continue mixing the gunpowder, adding water in small increments until the gunpowder is the texture of thick clay. Form it into a ball when you're finished.









If you mix the gunpowder with water, you'll need to corn the gunpowder, or break it up into small pieces. Run the gunpowder ball through a kitchen sieve to break it into small pieces, then let the pieces dry out on a piece of paper.
Again, be extremely careful around the gunpowder. Exercise caution at every stage.

, Place the black powder in a special container designed for gunpowder. Consider storing it in a fireproof box in a shed or another area outside your home. In any case, store the black powder in a stable area where it will not come into contact with a flame or be exposed to high temperatures.









You can buy powder containers at hardware stores or online.
Some recommend using empty (unused) paint cans to store black powder.

,
Store your black powder in a cool, dry place in plastic containers.",How to Make Black Powder," This is one of those instances where the better quality the ingredients you have, the better quality product you will produce. The saltpeter and the sulfur can be found in most drug stores.;
, Willow, birch, fir, oak, beech ash, pine, and spruce, when charred properly, are good woods to choose when selecting wood for your charcoal. Place the wood chips in a large pot with a lid or a 55 gallon (208 liter)barrel with a lid, just make sure there is a little open area (a crack where the lid meets the container or a small hole) so some steam can escape. Build a fire under your container. When steam begins to exit the container, light the wood inside and reclose the lid. Let the fires burn out and wait for everything to cool. What is left inside your container is your charcoal.

, Use a mortar and pestle or hand mill to grind the potassium nitrate. Set it aside. Grind the charcoal. Set it aside. Grind the sulfur into a powder as well, and then set it aside. It is very important to grind everything individually. You may also choose to use a ball mill. If this is the case, place your crushed charcoal and your sulfur in the mill, and run the mill for several hours. Once ground to a fine powder, remove from the mill.

,, The components of black powder used to be measured by weight. This has been calculated out, nowadays, as 75 parts potassium nitrate, 15 parts charcoal and 10 parts sulfur (or 25% charcoal/sulfur mix).

, Measure 1/4 cup (or 40 ml) of water for every 100 grams (about a 1/2 cup) of potassium nitrate in an old pan. Add your potassium nitrate. Bring to a boil. Stir continuously. Add little bits of water at intervals until the potassium nitrate is completely dissolved.

, Stir until all ingredients are completely combined.

, Add the hot mixture to your isopropyl alcohol. Stir together.

, The more quickly you can chill this to 0 °C (32 °F), the better.

, This will remove all the liquid from the solution. Throw out the liquid that got filtered out.

,, Spread it out on your paper again and allow it to dry some more.

Skin ducks quickly in the field to save space.,
Open up the skin on the breast.,
Stand with one foot on the head and one foot on the feet of the duck.,
Hook two fingers above and underneath the breast-bone.,
Pull upward firmly.",How to Field Dress a Duck5," If you're out on a serious hunting trip, you probably won't want to carry back a bunch of whole birds, most of which you're planning on discarding. If you're only after the meat, dressing them out quickly by removing the breasts and leaving the skin, feathers, and other mess in the field is a snap. You can also leave the wings on with this method, to stay in compliance with hunting regulations in your area.


If you've got the time, it's better to dress your ducks later and more thoroughly. There's more meat to be had, and the skin is a desirable eating feature for many cooks. This method should only be done in the field when storage is at a premium.

, Start by opening up the chest skin as you would doing a full skinning of the duck. Feel with your fingers for the breast-bone and tear the skin in opposite directions, opening up the chest like a shirt. Pull it back far enough to expose the breast in its entirety, then set it on the ground on its back.

, Hold the duck in place with your feet, putting one food on the duck's neck and one on it's feet. You're going to be pulling the breast out and leaving the rest of the duck on the ground, making it easy to hold the mess in place with your feet.

, With one hand, hook two fingers up under the breast plate, near the wishbone up toward the neck of the duck. With your other hand, hook two fingers underneath the breast plate near the abdomen.


You should be able to feel the breast quite distinctly on the duck, as it's the largest and most substantial portion of meat, slightly raised up above the abdomen, and slightly darker red in color than the surrounding tissue.

, After you've hooked your fingers firmly around the breast, pull upward, sawing back and forth slightly to help the breast come free. The wings, also, should pull through, because the joint is firm. Done correctly, you'll pull off the breast meat perfectly cleanly, with the wings attached, leaving the entrails, skin, head, tail, and feathers all on the ground. Perfect for the pot and so the game warden can identify it.

Remove any excess meaty tissue or membrane from the skin with a knife.,
Lay the skin out on the board, flesh side up, as flat as possible.,
Salt the remaining bit of rattle muscle and bone heavily and rub the salt in.,
Lay out the screen over the entire skin, leaving only the rattle (if present) sticking out.

,
Staple down the screen stretched tightly over the skin, beginning at the head end, keeping the skin as straight as possible and the edges even.,
Dry the skin in a cool, dry place with good air circulation and out of direct sunlight.,
Remove the screen from the hide and carefully take the skin off of the board.",How to Dry a Snakeskin," A small amount of membrane is acceptable, especially if the skin is only being dried until it can be tanned. Don't cut holes in the skin to get that last little bit of membrane. It will dry just like the skin, and can be scraped off after drying if necessary.;
, This is easiest if the skin is still very moist; as it dries, it will have a tendency to curl at the edges. This is another reason not to piddle with getting every little piece of flesh removed from the skin. If small holes near the edges of the skin not objectionable, it may help to staple the skin to the board in a few places now. Concentrate on getting the edges of the skin as naturally straight as possible and the skin in the position you will want it to be in once dry.
At the end of the skin where the rattle is attached, if there is one, the skin can be particularly troublesome. A staple in the very corner on each side of the tail can save a lot of trouble.

, This is to cause the muscle to dry rapidly, preventing spoilage. If the subject is not a rattlesnake, skip this step.

,, Keep in mind that anywhere the skin can curl, especially around the edges, it will curl. Don't hesitate to pull staples in order to get the screen absolutely as flat and tight as possible. It sometimes helps to take a narrow, flat board and use it to flatten out the bumps in the screen toward the edges of the skin. Of particular concern is the thin tail skin, which can curl in a very narrow space.

, This usually takes 1-3 days for most skins in a dry climate. High humidity may increase this drying time.

, It should be stiff and fully dry. Remember that a merely dried skin can be as easy to tear as paper. If the skin is stuck to the board, carefully slide something thin (such as a long knife blade) under it to free it.

Choose an area with suitable soil but do not remove any small trees or plants.,
Kill the weeds by spraying them with Roundup or other herbicides in the spring when they reach 8"" inches tall.,
Around early to mid-August rake off the dead weeds and brush and apply the fertilizers recommended from your soil test results.,
On the same day in early to mid-August as you did the previous step, apply your seeds with the hand-held seed spreader.,
Hang your tree stand, create shooting lanes, and make sure you do not set foot in your food plots until hunting season.",How to Create Deer Food Plots," Also, do not disk or turn over the brush and weeds either. Only take a soil sample and bring it down to get it tested. This step is crucial and you'll be sorry if you skipped it!;
, In 4 weeks spray it all again and leave them there to fully die for the rest of the summer. At this point it is good to put on the recommended amounts of lime pellets from the results of the soil test.

, Now is the time to take your steel come-along rake and lightly break-up the surface of your plot. Aren't you happy your food plot is small and manageable?

,


Make sure if your seed has a blend of different size seed, to open the hopper of your spreader far enough to only allow the smallest size seeds to go through when you first cover the whole plot. Next you can open it up to allow the next smallest size seed to go through, and keep doing this, until your recommended amount of seed is all gone.

, Now think of the great time you'll have hunting 2 or 3 of your different plots!

Mark the dowel rod.,
Remove the dowel rod.,
Measure the dowel rod.",How to Measure Gun Barrel1," Open the cylinder and remove any cartridges that are still inside.Point the gun in a safe direction and cup your left hand around the gun, keeping your fingers clear and away from the muzzle.
Push or pull the cylinder release latch on the left side of the gun with your right thumb. Swing the cylinder out to the side of the gun.
Slip the middle and ring finger of your left hand through the open frame.
Turn the gun so that the muzzle faces up. Close your left thumb and fingers around the cylinder.
Strike the ejector rod with the base of your palm one time. That should loosen the ammo sufficiently. Allow gravity to take over and drop the cartridges from inside the cylinder.
Check all compartments of the cylinder to verify that the gun is unloaded.;
, Slide the dowel rod into the barrel of the gun until it touches the face or front of the cartridge cylinder.Use a dowel rod that with a diameter that is smaller than the diameter of the revolver barrel. Do not force the dowel rod into the barrel since doing so can potentially cause damage to the gun.
The front face of the cylinder rests just behind the frame of the gun and is the actual start of the barrel. Note that the cylinder is not included in the length of the barrel.
When you are unable to push the dowel rod any further into the barrel, it has reached the face of the cartridge cylinder.

, Once the dowel rod is as deep as it will go, draw a line on the side of the dowel rod at the point where the dowel rod first extends out of the muzzle of the barrel.


Use a pen, pencil, or marker to draw this line. Make the line as close to the muzzle as possible.
Lie the gun down flat on your working surface as you do this.

, Carefully slide the dowel rod out of the gun barrel. Lay the gun aside and place the dowel on a flat working surface.


When setting the gun aside, make sure that the muzzle points away from you and away from anyone else. Even though you already unloaded the gun, you should always treat a firearm as though it is loaded.

, Use a measuring stick or measuring stick to measure the dowel rod from the marked point to the end previously inserted into the gun barrel.

Decide on a length of the stock.",How to Make a Sawed off Shotgun," Single and double barreled shotguns are often cheaper, but pump-actions and semi-auto shotguns have higher capacities.;
, The barrel must be no less 18 inches (45.7 cm) unless you fill out the appropriate NFA forms and pay the $200 tax (at that point, after getting approval from the ATF, the barrel can be any length), while the overall length must be a minimum of 26 inches (66.0 cm). It is advised to err on the side of legality by having a barrel length of 18 1⁄2 inches (47.0 cm). Accuracy is only severely affected when over 50% of the barrel is removed. Often the best place to stop is anywhere after the hand-guard or magazine tube ends. Less length equals less weight and slightly increased recoil.

, The metal is not hardened steel and will cut easily. You can use a hacksaw, bandsaw or a circular saw equipped with a suitable blade.

, Measure the barrel to your preferred length and wrap some masking tape around the barrel. Measure again and make several marks on the tape. Connect the marks, making a line completely around the barrel. Carefully cut the barrel using the line as a guide.

, Using a tubing cutter will result in a ridge on the inside of the barrel, this ridge should be filed smooth.

,, A stock allows the increased recoil to be controlled more easily. Keep in mind that the overall length of your modified shotgun must not be less than 26 inches (66.0 cm).

Definitely put on rubber gloves to avoid meat contamination and to keep your hands from being stained or covered in blood.

,
Have a heavy duty rope available in your vehicle.,
Tie the rope to the neck (or antler base if you are going to have the deer mounted).,
Pull the deer up off the ground so the hind legs are barely touching, either by hand or with a 4-wheeler or other vehicle.

,
If not mounting the head, cut the throat all the way to the wind pipe so that it falls down into the body cavity.

,
Start an incision at the crotch, going all the way up to the beginning the sternum if mounting the head.,
If mounting the head, reach up in the body cavity as far as you can and cut the wind pipe from the inside to avoid damaging the mountable piece.

,
Pull the wind pipe down so that it falls into the body cavity and cut the first membrane.,
Cut the second membrane and the guts will fall out on the ground.

,
Do as suggested above squeezing feces out of the intestine, cutting it and tying it off.,
If you have a gallon of water or a hose, you can now wash a lot of the blood out of the body cavity.,
Let the deer back down to the ground and you're through.,
If you wish to let the remaining blood drain from the deer overnight, leave the deer hanging.

",How to Field Dress a Deer2,", It is best to have it available so you do not leave the carcass when you go to get the rope.

, (You can also hoist a deer by the back legs if you find it easier.) Throw the other end over a stout tree branch a foot or two above head high. Make sure the rope is securely attached to the deer. You do not want it to fall when cleaning.

,,, Otherwise, cut all the way up through the ribs to one side of the sternum.

,, The guts will fall down to the second membrane.

,, Also, be careful of the bladder. If the bladder is cut, the urine inside will leak and ruin the meat.

, This is a good thing to do as it removes dirt, blood, and other unwanted things from the meat.

, Make sure the place where the deer is lied is clean. It is recommended to put down a tarp or other clean surface. This is a much easier and cleaner method than trying to clean the deer laying on the ground.

Ensure the deer is deceased.,
With the deer on its side, maneuver the deer so that its head is uphill if applicable.,
Get out your supplies; a sharp knife, gloves, bottle of water if necessary (to wash your hands/arms off afterward).,
At all times, be aware that the tarsal glands on the ankles of the deer have a strong musk and should not be handled.,
Starting at the anus, take a smaller sharp knife and carefully cut the ring of hide surrounding the anus to detach it from the hide.,
If you have a drag rope and a tree nearby, you can tie one of the deer's hind legs up at an angle against the tree to give you better access to the belly for dressing.,
Locate the sternum.,
Using your knife, very carefully create a slit in the hide where the sternum ends.,
Insert two gloved fingers into the hide.,
Using your fingers as a guide to LIFT the hide/thin muscle away from the gut pouch, slide your sharp short knife back into the slot and using one finger on either flat side of the knife, slide it down and cut down the length of the belly to the pelvic bone.,
Gently roll the organs out of the body cavity, away from the spine.,
Sever the diaphragm of the deer.,
Remove the diaphragm by cutting around the perimeter of it, where it connects to all inner walls of the chest cavity.

,
There are a few ways to remove the heart, lungs, and trachea.,
If not cutting the sternum then carefully reach up into the chest cavity from below.,
Remove all connective tissues to free the guts from the rear end of the deer.,If a hind leg of the deer is tied up, now release it.,
Roll the deer back onto its belly, splaying both the front shoulders and hind legs to allow the deer to drain and cool for a few minutes.,
Take a few minutes to clean up; select any organs that you wish to keep and set them aside.,
Remove your deer and take it with you by whatever means.,This method of dressing will also leave the deer's head/neck/shoulders in tact in case you wish to mount it.",How to Field Dress a Deer3," Approach from the back of the deer's shoulders; away from hooves and head. Using a long stick or piece of grass, touch it to the deer's open eye. If there is any reaction at all, a sound chest or neck shot will end things. If not mounting the head, a head shot would work also.

, This will help it drain as you dress it.

, Roll up your sleeves and put on the gloves.

, Bucks especially have a stronger musk and if this gets into the meat it will make it more gamy. Avoid touching the tarsal glands on the hind limbs of the deer (located at the ankles, they are a patch of longer fur and are often much darker in color), The object is to detach the anus and colon from the hide to prevent tearing and the soiling of meat by the deer's droppings. Gently tug the anus and attached colon (intestines) a few inches back away from the deer's body. If desired, you can tie it in a knot at this point.

, Or, if you have a hunting partner with you, they can help by holding the leg up.

, You can find it by feeling along the ribcage, to where it ends and forms a V shape at the base of the chest, just above where it meets the belly.

, Point the blade end of the knife toward the rear of the deer.

, You should be able to feel the difference between the hide wall and the membrane/muscle wall that holds the innards inside. The goal in the next part is to cut through the hide and muscle wall only to prevent cutting of the organs and tainting of the meat.

, When done properly there is no gore.

, Using care not to cut yourself or the guts, sever the attaching tissues. These tissues are stringy and attach the internal organs of the deer to its body and most are located along the spine. Unless you have the misfortune to have gut-shot the deer you should still have little to no gore or mess. The guts will tend to stay together.

, If the deer was heart/lung shot this is when you will need to be ready for gore; if necessary you may need to roll the deer onto its belly, and splay the limbs for a few minutes to let it drain.

,, Some prefer to cut through the sternum to open the rib cage. Some do not. If cutting through the rib cage it is pretty straightforward- simply sever the trachea as high up as possible, and the rest comes out.

, Be very careful-- broken bones/shoulders/ribs are sharp on a deer! Feel your way up the trachea as far as you can, then using your other hand very carefully sever the trachea as far up as you can. The lungs and heart should pull free easily now. Always use caution and care! Do this step at home if you are not feeling comfortable with it in the field.

, Use special care not to sever the bladder or colon/intestines! You can pull the colon and attached anus back into the body cavity to remove them. With a male deer you can now remove the internal genitalia. Check your state's regulations as sometimes it is necessary to leave the external genitalia in tact to prove the gender of your deer.

,, A trick is to take the deer by the antlers (or ears) and lift the head high while draining; this will allow any extra blood to drain out through the chest cavity.

, The heart and liver are widely considered desirable.As a precaution, avoid the brain, spinal cord, eyes, spleen, tonsils and lymph nodes if you are in an area where ""chronic wasting disease"" has affected deer.The rest you can leave if it is okay with the landowner to do so- the ravens, crows, foxes and other critters will thank you for the feast! They won't be wasted. Remove your gloves and put them in a carry-out trash bag and use some bottled water, snow, or nearby clean water source to scrub off any remaining blood. Don't forget to wash up thoroughly at home with soap and water.

, Keep the carcass as chilled and free of debris as possible. The sooner you can process it, the better quality your meat will be.

Unload the gun.,
Open and close the slide.,
Insert a dowel rod into the muzzle.,
Mark the end of the dowel.,
Remove the dowel rod.,
Measure the dowel rod.",How to Measure Gun Barrel2," Eject the magazine and remove any cartridges that are still inside.


Hold the gun in your dominant hand and point it in a safe direction.
Use your non-dominant hand to press the magazine catch/release latch at the side of the gun.
Slide the magazine off with your non-dominant hand or carefully tilt the muzzle of the gun upward until the magazine drops out with the support of gravity.

, Grab the slide with your non-dominant hand and glide it completely to the rear of the gun. Release the slide and allow it to move forward on its own.


Repeat the step two or three times.
During the last time, pull the slide to the rear and hold it in place. Use the thumb of your dominant hand to push on the slide catch before letting go of the slide.
The slide should be locked open and to the rear.
Look into the ejection port and down into the magazine well. Make sure that there is no ammo or debris in the magazine well or the chamber. Sweep away any obstructions with one finger.
Push the slide forward to close the breech face again.

, Slide the dowel rod into the muzzle. Continue sliding it into the barrel until it comes to a stop at the breech face.


Always use a dowel rod with a diameter that is smaller than the diameter of the barrel. Do not force the dowel rod into the barrel.
Note that the breech face is where the cartridge meets the chamber.
The chamber of the gun is included in the barrel measurement, which makes this measurement a little different from that of a revolver. You need to make sure that the dowel rod can reach into both the barrel and the chamber, stopping at the point where the cartridge head seats, where you will normally see the firing pin., Draw a line on the dowel rod where it first emerges from the muzzle of the gun.


Make the mark as close to the barrel as possible. Use a pencil, pen, or marker to draw it.
It might be easiest to do this with the gun lying flat on your work surface.

, Gently remove the dowel from the barrel by sliding it back out through the muzzle.


Set the gun aside in a safe spot.
Lay the dowel rod down on a flat working surface.

, Measure the distance between the mark you just drew and the end of the dowel rod you just removed from the barrel of the gun. You can use either a measuring stick or measuring tape to do so.


The distance between the two points equals the length of the gun barrel.

Remove any ammo.,
Insert a dowel rod into the barrel.,
Make a mark.,
Slide the dowel rod out.,
Take a measurement.",How to Measure Gun Barrel3," Even if you believe the gun to be unloaded, you should still go through the unloading process to verify that no ammo is inside the shotgun as you measure the barrel.Point the gun in a safe direction and turn it over. Look for a lever that moves up and down at the receiver. This lever is known as an elevator.
Flip the elevator up with your dominant hand while pushing back on the slide with your non-dominant hand. This should eject any round inside the magazine from the bottom of the receiver.

, Slide a dowel rod into the muzzle of the shotgun, pushing it into the barrel until it hits and stops at the breech face.Always use a dowel rod with a diameter that is smaller than the diameter of the gun barrel to prevent accidental damage to the gun barrel. Never force the dowel rod into the barrel.
The point at which the cartridge and chamber meet is referred to as the breech face. The cartridge is not included in the barrel measurement, but the chamber will be.

, Use a pen to mark a line around the circumference of the dowel rod, just above the point where it comes out of the muzzle.


Make the mark as close to the muzzle as possible for the most accurate measurement.
You may need to keep the gun flat on your working surface as you do this.
A pencil or marker could be used instead of a marker.

, Gently slide the dowel rod back out of the barrel. Set the dowel rod flat on your working surface.


Carefully set the gun aside, as well. Make sure that the gun points away from you and from any other living being.

, Grab a measuring stick or tape measure and measure the distance between the mark you created and the end of the dowel rod previously inserted into the gun barrel.


The distance between these two points is the length of your gun barrel.

Empty the gun.,
Close the bolt or breech face.,
Slide an appropriate dowel rod into the barrel.,
Make a mark just above the muzzle.,
Carefully remove the dowel rod.,
Measure the correct distance.",How to Measure Gun Barrel4," Go through the unloading process as usual, even if you believe the gun to be empty already.


With the gun pointing in a safe direction, turn it over and look for the elevator--a lever that moves up and down, located at the receiver.
Use your dominant hand to hold the elevator in the up position.
Use your non-dominant hand to simultaneously push back on the slide. Any round inside the magazine should naturally eject from the gun through the bottom of the receiver.

, Make sure that the bolt of the shotgun or the breech face of the gun is closed before you try to measure it.


The length of the barrel for this type of gun does not include the length of the entire barrel piece. Instead, the length is a measurement of the distance between the muzzle end of the barrel and the face of the bolt or breech face when that portion of the gun is closed.
Close a bolt by pushing it forward and down.
Close a non-bolt breech face by pushing the slide forward.

, Insert a dowel into the muzzle end of the barrel, pushing it down into the barrel until it stops against the bolt or breech face.


Use a dowel rod with a diameter that is smaller than the diameter of the barrel.
If the barrel has a permanent choke tube attached, include that in your length measurement. If it has a removable choke tube attached, remove the choke tube before sliding the dowel into the barrel and do not include the choke tube in your measurement.

, Draw a line on the dowel rod, placing it just above the muzzle of the gun.


You can use a pencil, pen, or marker to do this. Regardless of the instrument you use, keep the line as close to the muzzle as possible.
If the gun is not already lying flat on a working surface, you should lay it down while marking the dowel rod. Doing so will likely make the process easier and safer.

, Slide the dowel back out of the barrel. Set it down in front of you on your work surface.


Set the gun aside. Make sure that it is pointed in a safe direction.

, Measure the distance between the line on your dowel rod and the end of the dowel rod previously inside the shotgun barrel.


This distance is the length of your gun barrel.

Verify that the gun is unloaded.,
Close any bolts or breech faces.,
Slip a dowel rod into the barrel.,
Mark the dowel rod at the correct point.,
Remove the dowel rod.,
Measure the length.",How to Measure Gun Barrel5," Regardless of whether or not you believe the rifle to be unloaded, you should go through the unloading process before attempting to measure the barrel.


Note that the measuring process is essentially the same for all rifles, including both bolt-action and semi-automatic rifles. There can be some differences in the unloading process, however.
For a bolt-action rifle:Point the gun in a safe direction, supporting the barrel with your dominant hand.
Click the bolt upward and back to open it, using your non-dominant hand.
Look down into the chamber and into the magazine. If there is any ammo in the gun, carefully slide the bolt into the magazine until it ejects the cartridges.


For a semi-automatic rifle:Point the gun in a safe direction.
Locate the magazine release latch at the rear of the magazine cover. Pull the latch back to drop the magazine open. The cartridges inside the magazine should drop out of the bottom.



, The length of the barrel spans between the muzzle and the face of the bolt or breech face. Do not measure any portion of the barrel that extends behind the bolt or breech face.


Close the bolt by sliding it forward and down.
Close the breech face by pushing the slide back and allowing it to snap back forward.

, Insert an appropriately sized dowel rod into the muzzle. Slide it into the barrel until it comes to a stop at the face of the bolt or the breech face.


The diameter of the dowel should be smaller than the diameter of the gun barrel.

, Draw a line just above the muzzle, keeping your writing instrument as close to the muzzle as possible for a more accurate reading.


Use a pencil, pen, or permanent marker for best results.

, Slide the dowel out of the barrel. Place the dowel in front of you and set the gun aside.


When setting the gun aside, make sure that it is pointing in a safe direction.

, Using a tape measure or measuring stick, measure the distance between the line and the end of the dowel previously inside the barrel.


The length of this section is the length of the gun barrel.

Get the necessary parts.,
Use a 9mm bullet as a guide.,
Make sure that there are no cracks or other flaws in the pipe or fittings.,
Drill into the coupling to remove the thread.,
Drill a hole in the center of the pipe plug just large enough for the nail to fit through.,
Bend the metal band into a ""U"" shape.,
Fashion a basic stock and handle from wood.,
Fix the metal bracket to the back of the gun.,
Fire the gun by pulling the bracket back and releasing it.",How to Make a Real Gun1," The United States Army provides literature about improvising small arms with a minimum of readily-available simple parts, for use in emergency combat situations. To build a basic 9mm gun, you'll need:


4-6 inches of quarter-inch nominal steel pipe, threaded on each end
Two steel pipe couplings
A quarter-inch pipe plug
two rubber bands
A thin metal strap at least 5 inches long
A nail
Two wood screws
A drill
Please note: If you attempt to fire a bullet from a piece of pipe that you're holding in your hand, and that bullet doesn't fit snugly in the piping, or the pipe isn't thick enough to withstand the pressure of the expanding explosion you're creating by striking the bullet, the pipe is going to blow up in your face, injuring or possibly killing you. Use extreme caution.;
, Casings come in different sizes or calibers, and you need to use the size of the bullet to measure the opening in pieces of prospective pipe. 9mm is a common round size, and it's 0.38 of an inch (38 caliber). If you want to fire a .38 round, then, use a 0.38 caliber round as the source for all measurements. Find a suitably-sized drill bit matching the diameter of the projectile or a pre-drilled piece of piping.

, Check the inside diameter of the pipe, using a 9 mm cartridge as a gauge. The bullet should closely fit into the pipe without forcing, but the cartridge case should not fit into pipe. The outside diameter of the pipe must not be less than 1-1/2 times bullet diameter (0.536 inches; 1.37 cm).

, Make a 9/16 inch (1.43 cm) diameter hole 3/8 inch into one coupling to remove the thread. This drilled section should fit tightly over the smooth section of pipe.


Next, drill a 25/64 inch (1 cm) diameter hole 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) into the pipe. Always use the cartridge you intend to use as a gauge. When a cartridge is inserted into the pipe, the base of the jacket should be even with the end of the pipe. Thread the coupling tightly onto pipe, drilled end first.

, The nail must be centered in the plug. Push it through until it's even with the squared-off end of the plug and round it off if necessary, using a file.

, Drill two holes in the flaps to fit diameter of the wood screws you're using. This will be used as a basic hammer to spring forward and strike the bullet, using the rubber bands to create tension, so you might also notch some small notches into the metal to keep the rubber bands from slipping.

, The design is up to you, but it needs to be roughly an inch thick after being drilled and at least two inches longer than the assembled length of the pipe you're outfitting. Drill a 1.43 cm hole through the stock, about 1/2 cm from the top.


Slide the pipe through this hole and attach the first of the two couplings to the front tip and screw the drilled plug into the back end of the pipe, the end closest to the handle.

, The idea is to position the nail in the metal bracket so it will swing forward and strike the bullet. When you've got it placed, screw it into the wood using the wood screws. To create tension, attach your rubber bands between the front coupling and the notches on the metal bracket.


This basic design can work for ammunition of any caliber, as long as you change the measurements to correspond to the specific size of the bullet you're trying to fire.

, Remember: this is extraordinarily dangerous if it hasn't been measured properly. To try to ensure your safety, hold the pipe with a rag or welder's gloves, and place your shell or bullet in the pipe. Aim it at an appropriate target and strike the bullet squarely with the firing pin.

Decide on the size of your trap.,
Cut the wood you choose (Use 1"" X 4"" strips) to fit.,
You will want some sort of backing -- Luan Plywood or something like that is more than sufficient.,
Assemble the box.,
Once you have all four corners done, you will have an open box.,
Fill the box with one layer of duct seal.,
Mount a clip to hold the targets.",How to Make a Pellet Trap," There are several options but basically you want your trap to be slightly larger than the size of the targets you will be using. If you will be using various target sizes, base your trap on the largest size target. For my trap, I used letter-sized targets that I print myself, so 8 1/2"" X 11"" is the size!;
, Don't forget to add for the thickness of the wood (1"" wood is actually 3/4"" thick!). Thus, for the 8 1/2"" sides you want to cut two strips to 8 1/2"" lengths (assuming using box joints as shown in the diagram).


For the long dimension -- 11"" you need to add 3/4"" twice for two strips 12 1/2"" long.

, Cut your backing to 10"" (8 1/2"" plus two 3/4"") by 12 1/2"" (this length already accounts for the thickness of the wood). If you want perfection, assemble the sides first and measure for the backing.

, To prevent splitting, either use small wood screws about 1 1/2"" in length or drill holes somewhat about the size of the screw shaft. Two screws in each joint are sufficient. Another screw option is deck screws -- they are cheap but will require drilling to prevent splitting.

, Attach your backing using about two screws per side. Again, no stress is placed on the box -- you just want something that that will hold together.

, A thinner layer is sufficient, but duct seal is a bit messy to work with and it is far easier to simply use the entire thickness of the ""brick."" You will need enough ""bricks"" to fill in the entire area. I had some left over and cut that into strips to seal between bricks.

, A heavy paper clip is perfect. Remove one wire and hot-glue that side to the upper edge of the target box with the remaining wire sticking up.

Point the gun away from you.,
Press the bolt release on a pump-action shotgun.,
Pull back and release the bolt-grip on an auto-loading shotgun.,
Open the hinge on a break action shotgun.The hinge is located between the receiver and stock.,
Remove all shells and put them in a safe place.,
Remove the barrel.If you have a pump-action shotgun, twist off the end-cap located at the top of the pump, right next to the barrel.,
Wipe down all components with a clean cloth.Remove the thick, caked-on carbon buildup, which is created by the friction of use.,
Spray solvent liberally on all components.,
Scrub all over the surface of the gun with a soft-bristled brush.,
Wipe the gun down with a lint-free cloth.,
Soak the gun in solvent again.,
Use a gun cleaning pick to clean off any carbon and powder buildup.Gun cleaning picks are usually made of high-strength polymer, which will not scratch the surface of your gun.,
Swab down into the barrel using a clean, solvent-soaked cloth.Use a cleaning rod to swab the cloth into the bore.,
Oil the components requiring lubrication.,
Wipe down the surface with a clean cloth to remove excess oil.,
Open the breach and put the barrel back on.,
Do a quick test for functionality.,
Store your gun in a hardshell case instead of a cloth case.",How to Maintain a Shotgun," Always begin by pointing the gun in a safe direction, which is away from your body and anyone else in the room. If possible, clean your shotgun during times when you can do so alone, without anyone else around.Keep your finger off the trigger as you point the gun away from your body.;
, The bolt release is usually located in front of or behind the trigger guard. When you pull back the bolt release, the gun will empty one shell.Cycle the pump action and then repeat until there are no shells visible in the magazine tube or in the chamber.


Pump-action shotguns have one barrel, but the magazine tube can hold multiple shells, so make sure you check thoroughly., When you pull back and then release, the gun will empty one shell. Continue repeating this action until there are no shells visible in the magazine tube or in the chamber.


Make sure to double check the magazine tube, which could be storing multiple shells., Remove the shell (most break action shotguns can only load one shell at a time) from the chamber end of the barrel and then close the hinge again.


If your break action gun is a double barrel firearm, make sure to check both chambers for shells.

, Make sure to put the shells far away from where you are working – some people even recommend putting ammunition in another room while you’re cleaning your gun, just to be absolutely safe.


Double check to confirm you have removed all the shells from the magazine/tube.
Put the bolt action button back in place to make sure there is no ammunition left in the gun., Sometimes the barrel will stick – if your barrel is sticking, slide the pump arm all the way down and then open the breach, which will release the barrel.Twist the barrel off away from the gun itself.
For single-shot shotguns, take off the forearm and then remove the barrel.
For semi-automatic shotguns, pull the action all the way back. Unscrew the forearm cap and then slide the forearm off.

, Inspect and wipe carefully to remove any traces of old oil and all unburnt powder buildup. Clean all the gaps well.


Be sure to wipe the ejector and the area around the chamber, too.
You will find that after cleaning certain areas, your cloth will be black. Clean these areas more until this no longer happens.

, It is better to spray more solvent than you need rather than not enough. Make sure to cover all areas and focus on those that are visibly caked with dirt and buildup. After generously applying the solvent, allow it to sit for 15 minutes so that the dirt and buildup are well-soaked.There are many solvent products on the market. Some are quite toxic, so be sure to read instructions and warnings on the bottle before using.
If recommended by the manufacturer, use a face mask to reduce inhalation of toxicants and wear gloves.
Some solvent products are safe for skin contact. If possible, look for these products and use those for your gun cleaning. M-Pro 7 is one such product.

, You can buy special brushes made for this, but a soft-bristled toothbrush will also work great. Scrub the surface thoroughly, working in the solvent, which helps loosen the buildup on the gun.


Be thorough and try to get into all the nooks and crannies with your brush.

, In this instance, a completely lint-free cloth allows for the most effective cleaning. Wipe the entire surface of the gun, removing all of the dirt and solvent. Concentrate on any areas that turn your cloth black and wipe until no more black appears., Spray the solvent all over the gun, just as you did before, and wipe it down thoroughly again. Concentrate on any areas that turn your cloth black and strive to get into the nooks and crannies.


This second wipe-down will get the surface of your gun pristine.

, The most common area for carbon deposits is in the chamber, and the most effective way of cleaning this is with a pick.


Gun cleaning picks are tools with different kinds of hooked and pointed ends designed to clean the really hard to reach areas of your gun.They look a lot like the dental picks your dentist uses during a routine tooth cleaning.
Be sure to also clean in the corners and sides of the metal, since these are other areas where buildup often occurs.

, Repeat this action with more clean, solvent-soaked cloths until the cloths come out with no visible residue on them. Then use a dry cloth to swab any remaining dirt from the barrel.


Soak another clean cloth in oil and swab the barrel with this, which will protect it from rust.
Instead of using a cleaning rod and cloth to clean the barrel, try a reusable foam swab made particularly for gun cleaning. This looks like a household Q-Tip except much larger, and you can remove the tip, wash it, and reuse it.For a less precise cleaning on a pump-action shotgun, run a boresnake through the barrel. This is a good instrument to use when your gun doesn’t need a deep cleaning, but rather a quick touch up.

, Oil-requiring components vary from gun to gun, so check your gun manual for information about the specific areas that need oil on your particular firearm. If you don’t have a manual, inspect the gun for the areas that have visible wear and apply the oil in those places.


Oil aids in gun preservation, and you should use the oil sparingly.Be sure to oil the rails for the bolt and the bolt itself to prevent oxidation.
Avoid getting oil around the housing and the firing pin, which can cause malfunctions and can prevent the gun from firing., If you accidentally got any oil on the wooden parts of your shotgun, immediately wipe the oil off with a clean, dry cloth.


Gun oil can soften the wood, causing it to be more easily scratched and dented., Twist back on the end cap and then close the breach, fully reattaching the barrel back onto your shotgun. Visually inspect the exterior for any remaining dirty areas. If you spot any, wipe with a clean, lint-free cloth.


Always wash your hands after handling the gun and cleaning supplies.

, Always do this before you reload the gun. Open and close the action, shoulder the shotgun, and take a moment to aim it at something and make sure everything feels right.

, Cloth cases will absorb the oil that you just applied to the gun, which could lead to rust.Put a packet of moisture desiccant in the case with the gun. This will help cut down on any moisture build-up while your gun is being stored."

Choose the type of steel to be used for the gun barrel.,
Cut a piece of steel for the barrel stock.,
Drill the barrel.,
Ream the barrel.,
Rifle the barrel.,
Lap the barrel to fine polish the bore.",How to Make a Gun Barrel," The steel chosen must have a strength of 100,000 psi (689476 kPA) to withstand the force of the gasses that propel the round. The steel should have a hardness of 25 to 32 on the Rockwell scale so that the steel is strong enough to contain the pressure necessary to propel the round through the barrel, but not so brittle that it will be harmed by the machining operations to be performed. Obtain 1.25 inch (31.75 mm) rods from a specialty steel mill. Ask for a quality certification on the steel. Specify that the steel must be stress relieved at the steel mill.


Select 4140 chrome moly steel. Chrome moly steel is the least expensive alternative. It also is easier to chemically blacken, if desired, to give a traditional look to the barrel.
Decide on 416 stainless steel. Stainless steel is more expensive than chrome moly Steel. Stainless steel barrels have have a longer service life and are result in a more accurate firearm than do chrome moly steel barrels.;
, Cut a length of steel around 28 inches (71.1 cm) to 30 inches (711.2 mm to 762 mm). Ensure that the ends of the barrel stock are true in parallelism to each other, are faced off and are perfectly round.

, Drill down the interior lengthwise to a diameter about 5 thousandths of an inch (0.127 mm) less than the desired finished bore diameter of the barrel. A special drill, known as a deep hole drill, must be used to drill the barrel. The deep hole drill will hold the tungsten carbide drill bit still and spin the barrel to perform the drilling. Drilling will be liquid cooled and will proceed at about 1 inch (25.4 mm) per minute. Total time to drill the hole will be about 30 minutes.

, Work a tungsten carbide bore reamer down the finished drill hole of the barrel, using liquid coolant as the reamer works. The reamer will expand the hole to the desired finished bore, and smooth the inner drilled surface of the barrel as it creates the final desired bore.

, Rifling consists of spiral grooves in the bore, which will impart a spin to the fired round as it travels down the barrel. This spin will gyro stabilize the flight of the fired round. Determine the number of rifling grooves to be placed in the bore and the amount of twist to be put on the rifling grooves. Consult with experts in the field of gun barrel making to determine this information. Find these experts at specialty gun barrel making shops.


Make the first rifling groove. Insert a tube mounted with the rifling hook cutter box down the bore of the barrel. Draw the rifling hook cutter box through the bore while rotating the barrel at a rate recommended by the expert to give the desired rifling spin.
Add more rifling grooves. Index the barrel to the starting position for the next groove. Draw the rifling hook cutter box through the bore while rotating the barrel at a rate recommended by the expert to give the desired rifling spin.
Finish the rifling. Repeat passes through the bore with the rifling hook cutter box as needed.

,


Insert the barrel lapping rod into the bore until it is about 4 inches (101.6 mm) from 1 end of the bore. Pour molten lead into the end of the bore and allow it to harden.
Push the lap out of the barrel. Push the lapping rod forward until the now solidified lead slug, called the lead lap, is exposed. Cover the lead lap with lapping paste, which is similar to valve grinding paste.
Complete the lapping. Run the lead lap up and down the length of the barrel about 50 times, applying more lapping paste as necessary.

Always test your gun before firing it from your hand.,
Create a barrier.,
Attach a cord to the firing strap on the pistol.,
Release the cord to fire the pistol.",How to Make a Real Gun2," With a little planning and extra effort, you can make sure your gun won't explode when you try to fire it.

, Stand behind a stone wall or large tree and fashion a simple rope-pull to activate the gun from safety. Mount pistol solidly to a table, bracing it in a boot or between two heavy books, or some other rigid support, at least ten feet in front of the barrier.

, Just tie a string, elastic band, or some other cord to the metal bracket to pull back and release.

, If pistol does not fire, shorten the elastic bands or increase their number. Fire at least five rounds from behind the barrier and then reinspect the pistol before you attempt to hand fire it.


There's the serious potential of injury in the making of homemade weapons. Take this seriously and use extreme caution.

Familiarize yourself with gun laws regarding parts kits.,
Acquire a parts kit of the kind of gun you'd like to assemble.,
Consider attending a ""build party.""",How to Make a Real Gun3," Commercial parts kits include all the hardware necessary to make your own gun. Often, the kits are for a restricted non sporting or semiautomatic ""machine gun,"" but also black powder rifles and other niche weapons are sold in kit form for you to build yourself.


Often these parts kits are compiled from guns like AK-47s that have been deconstructed in demilitarized regions and legally imported as parts. To be legally acceptable, such a gun must be sufficiently redesigned. Basically, the receiver must be incapable of accepting the original fire-control components that are designed to permit full automatic fire.
An acceptably redesigned semiautomatic copy of non sporting firearm must be limited to using less than 10 of the imported parts listed in 27 CFR § 478.39(c). Otherwise, it is considered to be assembled into a nonsporting configuration per the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 925(d)(3) and is thus a violation of § 922(r).The parts list includes:

Frames, receivers, receiver castings, forgings, or castings
Barrels
Barrel extensions
Mounting blocks (trunnions)
Muzzle attachments
Bolts
Bolt carriers
Operating rods
Gas pistons
Trigger housings
Triggers
Hammers
Sears
Disconnectors
Buttstocks
Pistol grips
Forearms, handguards
Magazine bodies
Followers
Floor plates



, These can be somewhat difficult to find and you might not be comfortable ordering such a package online, if you don't know the source or the location of the seller. Use your judgment. You don't want ATF agents coming to your door for ordering illegal parts.


Consider attending a gun show in your area and asking around if you want to purchase a parts kit. They may be available (most owners of semiautomatic weapons purchase them at gun shows), or they may be able to instruct about safe and legal retailers of kits., It's common for gun enthusiasts to hold build parties, sometimes making kits available to attendees for the right price. Generally held at gun clubs or private residences in many areas, build parties will have all the hardware available to build your gun in the span of an afternoon.


At a build party, you'll generally have to sign a safety waiver and a non-disclosure agreement, making information about these types of ""parties"" somewhat difficult to come by. Your best bet is to visit your local gun retailer, gun event, or just to ask around.

Make sure the safety is on, the chamber unloaded, and the barrel pointed away from you in a safe direction.,
Determine what gauge (bore diameter) your shotgun is so you can select the right size shells.,
Place the butt of the stock on your left thigh while sitting.,
Place a single shell against the loading flap just ahead of the trigger guard.,
Using your thumb, push the shell straight up into the loading flap until you hear and feel a distinct click.,
Repeat until the magazine tube is full.,
Hold in the action release button and pump the slide backwards and then forwards with a reasonable amount of force to load the chamber.",How to Load a Shotgun1," This is always the first step when loading or handling any gun. Consult your weapon's instruction manual to locate the safety feature.;
, Common shotgun sizes are 10, 12, 16, 20, .410 bore, and 28. Shotshell of one gauge may be fired in a shotgun of another gauge, but doing so requires a special tube. Otherwise it is best to just select the proper sized ammo for your weapon.

, You can also secure the stock under your arm with the gun turned sideways. Make sure that the trigger and trigger guard are positioned on the side of the shotgun facing away from you.

, The ""business end"" of the shell should be pointing toward the end of the gun barrel. The business end is the end of the shell that the shot comes out of and is opposite the metal capped end of the shell where the explosive charge is housed.








, When it clicks, the rim of the shell should have passed the magazine catch.








, You can tell the tube is full when you attempt to load a shell but it won't go in.








, This will strip a shell from the magazine and load it into firing position. The shotgun is now ready to fire.

Find a normal sized BIC pen, preferably a 0.7 pen.,
Take the writing end of the pen off.Now start working on the other end until it is extracted.You should be left with a hollow tube.

,
Get a small rubber balloon and put it over one end of the empty pen tube, then glue it in place.

,
Inflate it by blowing into the open side of your pen.Once that is done, grip it by the neck to keep the air inside.,
Slide a small projectile down the barrel,but keep the air in side the balloon.

,
Attach the balloon about halfway from the neck; this will ensure that you have room so that when you start to inflate the air gun you will have plenty of room to hold the air inside.

,
Use Krazy Glue to keep it in place once it is put on the pen.

,
To fire, all you need to do is release your grip from the small balloon, releasing the pressure.",How to Make an Air Gun with a Balloon," Be sure that the diameter is medium sized.;

Remove the safety and squeeze the trigger.",How to Load and Fire a Muzzleloader," There are three basic types of muzzleloaders, and you need to make sure that you select ammunition, powder, and a method of loading appropriate to each.


The traditional muzzleloader is the flintlock rifle. These feature a more complex but authentic firing mechanism, and a longer ""twist rate,"" which refers to the length of time it takes for the bullet to make a rotation in the barrel. The twist rate affects the accuracy of the rifle. Traditional muzzleloaders with a longer twist rate are generally more accurate when using what are called ""buffalo"" bullets, which feature the traditional lead ball and a more modern ""bullet shaped"" lead. Flintlock rifles require a complex loading operation, fixing a piece of flint to the hammer to strike sparks onto the flashpan, an operation covered below.
Caplock rifles have a side-mounted firing pin similar to the flintlock rifle, and operates and loads in much the same way, but uses a more modern pre-loaded firing cap to fire the rifle. Unless you're a very experienced firearms enthusiast, it's recommended to use this method and become familiar with the mechanics of muzzle loading before you attempt to fire a flintlock.In-line percussion muzzleloaders are more modern-looking rifles that blur the line between old-school black powder rifles and contemporary smokeless models.They feature a shorter twist rate and are generally more accurate and easier to load than traditional muzzleloaders, and employ a firing cap in the pin.;
, Traditional black powder can be used in any variety of muzzleloader, though more modern pellet forms are also available. These are pre-measured into compact pellets that can be dropped into the barrel to load.


Traditional powder has a tendency to rust barrels if not cleaned regularly and efficiently. Black powder absorbs moisture, making it sometimes volatile. When you're just getting started, consider using powder pellets as you get used to your rifle and the way it fires.

, In the beginning, it can be somewhat difficult to figure out what ammo might be the most efficient and accurate for your gun. By becoming somewhat familiar with the way your rifle fires, though, and trying out the different types of muzzleloader shot, you can settle on something that works.


Traditional ""round ball"" ammo is made of pure lead and designed to work with cloth patches. If you want to fire in the old-school way that the pioneers did, this is your ammo. If you're hunting, you might want to select something a little more accurate.
Conical shot is a more ""bullet shaped"" muzzleloader shot. It tends to be a bit lighter, more accurate, and come in different sizes, depending on the bore of your rifle.
""Sabot"" refers to a small plastic shoe or sleeve used to nestle a rifled bullet in. Using a sabot is a way to increase the accuracy of your rifle and to use somewhat smaller, lighter bullets in a larger-bore rifle barrel. If you're planning on hunting with a muzzleloader, using a sabot with an appropriate-sized ammunition is recommended., Most ammunition sold with wadding patches of the appropriate size, used to seat the shot against the powder charge. Wadding is usually a chunk of cloth or paper placed behind the projectile to seal the bore, or placed in front of it to prevent the ball(s) from simply rolling out the end of the barrel when the gun is pointed downwards.


One of the best materials for this is known as ""Pillow Ticking"" and can be easily found at a fabric store. If you can't get it, just use paper towels.
Lubricant is used to reduce friction and make the gun function better. In rifled guns, the barrel is lubricated as well as the patch (wad) after each shot to make the projectile easier to load down the rifled barrel.

, Depending on the type of rifle you have, you'll also need firing caps to discharge your rifle, or you'll need flint for use in a flintlock rifle, to strike and spark and set off the powder in the flashpan.


The most common cap is called the #11 cap, which has been in use for more than a hundred years.
Musket caps are somewhat more powerful and are popular with hunters for that reason.

, Verify that the gun is not loaded by putting the ramrod down the barrel and measuring the distance that it can reach. It must reach all the way to the location of the touch hole in the pan. Use your cleaning rod to clean the barrel of any black powder residue, dirt or dust that may have accumulated.


While loading the gun, keep it aimed straight up in the air and avoid putting your face over the barrel at any time, even while you're loading it.

, Most muzzleloaders will come with a swab (a piece of cloth used to lubricate the rifle) fitted to the slot in the cleaning rod. Apply gun lubricant to the inside of the barrel. Do not apply too much, as it can get in the touch hole and prevent ignition. A thin layer is sufficient, no more than the amount of sunscreen you'd put on your face

, Pour black powder from your horn or flask into the powder measurer to the appropriate mark, then pour the powder from the measurer into the muzzle.


Tap the side of the rifle a few times with the flat of your hand to settle the powder.

, Using the smaller end of the bullet-starter, push the bullet into the barrel. Be gentle. When you get to the end of the starter, pull it out and use the longer end to push it farther down.Use the ramrod to seat the bullet securely on the powder charge. Use a short but firm motions to seat it, don't jam it in a stabbing motion like you see in old Civil War movies. There's a mark on the ramrod that will let you know when the bullet has been seated. When that mark lines up with the end of the barrel, the bullet should be seated properly.
It's important to make sure the bullet is seated firmly on the charge, leaving no gaps between the powder and the bullet.

, With the gun pointed in a safe direction, use your priming tool to seat the cap on the nipple. Make sure the safety is on, if your rifle has one, or that you're at half-cock, if you're using a side-lock rifle.

, Pull the hammer back to the half-cock position. If there is no flint already in the gun, use a screwdriver or metal bar to loosen the screw which holds the top jaw of the cock in place. Use a rectangular scrap of leather the right size to enclose the flint, and fold it around the back of the flint. Place the flint with the leather in the jaws of the cock so that the sharp end protrudes towards the flash pan and tighten the screw securely.

, Close the frizzen (the part that covers the pan) and test fire it by pulling the trigger. Ensure the lock produces a shower of sparks that hit the inside of the flashpan.


If it doesn't, remove the flint and reattach it. Make sure everything is secure and striking appropriately. Take your time.

, Loosen the screw on the side of the brass powder measurement. Draw the sliding end of the measurement back to the line that marks the amount of powder required for your specific gun and tighten the screw.


Consult your firearms dealer to determine the correct amount of powder to use for your gun.

, Lift the muzzle of the gun so that the barrel is perpendicular to the ground. Level off the top of the powder measurement and pour the powder into the barrel. Tap the side of the barrel with the heel of your hand a few times to ensure the powder all falls tho the bottom.

, Place a lubricated patch over the end of the barrel. This patch should be larger than the ball and should be able to wrap around it. Press the patched ball into the barrel using the short end of the bullet starter.


Continue to slide the ball or bullet down the barrel with the long side of the bullet starter. Use the blunt end of the ram rod to slide the ball down the rest of the barrel until it is seated firmly atop the powder. Use one steady motion to seat the bullet, don't jab into the gun like you see in the movies.







, Once the ball has been seated, remove the ramrod and lay the gun across your lap. Fill the small brass flash pan powder dispenser with the FFFF powder used in flintlock rifles for this purpose. This can be done by unscrewing the back of the dispenser and pouring powder in until it is about 3/4 full.


Pull the hammer back again to half-cock. If the frizzen (pan cover/striking surface) is not already open, open it, and press the pointed end of the powder dispenser against the bottom of the shallow flash pan to release the powder.






Fill the pan with powder making sure to tilt the gun slightly so that the powder enters the touch hole located at the side of the barrel within the flash pan. Once the pan is full, close the cover tightly. Your gun is loaded and ready to fire.

, Pull the hammer to full-cock, and aim the muzzle at your target. Be sure that no one is standing directly beside you in front of the touch hole. Sparks will fly and you want to make sure everyone is clear of the expulsion.


Always wear the appropriate ear and eye protection when firing a muzzleloader. It's loud. Practice good gun safety.

, Look down the length of the barrel through the open sights. When all three sights are in line both vertically and horizontally upon the target you wish to hit, take a deep breath and hold it.


Some muzzleloaders don't have much in the way of sights. You can consider updating your old-school weapon by fitting it with more modern sights. This is especially recommended if you plan on hunting with your muzzleloader.

, Keep the rifle securely in your shoulder and follow through, holding your position and waiting until the smoke clears (there will be a lot) before dropping your posture and looking at your target.


In a flintlock rifle, the flint will slam down, scraping down the inside of the frizzen and flipping open the flashpan, creating sparks which fall into the powder in the now open flashpan. This powder ignites, making a flash of flame which travels into the touch hole and ignites the main charge.

, This will usually be on the right side of the gun, where the barrel meets the stock.


Unlike a pump-action shotgun, a break action has no magazine tube to load several shells at a time into. Instead, the gun breaks open to allow you to load a shell directly into the chamber of your barrel (or barrels). This means your gun needs to be reloaded after every shot, or every two shots if you have a double-barreled shotgun.

,, Be careful: these may be hot if the gun was recently fired. Try not to let your hand touch the metal of the barrel.

, The business-end of the shell should slide into the barrel.

, Your gun is now loaded and ready to fire.

, Use bubble wrap or other high-quality padding. Contact the carrier you plan to use. Ask a staff member to recommend packing material appropriate for a firearm. Ask your local gun store if they wouldn’t mind parting with their used packing material.


Avoid wadded up newspaper, plastic wrap, or baby diapers. These won’t cut it. If the firearm is damaged in shipping, claims against the carrier may be denied if your packaging was substandard.

, Ship it separately. Federal law prohibits the shipping of ammunition with firearms. Pack it securely in separate boxes or metal clips that fit snugly within the main package. Make sure the ammo containers can’t be opened in transit.Clearly label the package as containing ammunition. Visit UPS.com, FedEx.com, or USPS.gov to print the required ORM-D label or black and white diamond to designate your package as explosive.You must bring packages with ammunition directly to a staffed carrier location. Don’t deposit them in public mailboxes or drop boxes., Avoid writing “Firearm” or other references to the specific contents of the package. This ban includes preprinted areas on your box, your business return address, and the shipping address. If words like “gun,” “firearm,” or “boom-stick” are on anything, take them off., Insert a photocopy of your state-issued photo ID into the package if you are shipping to an FFL holder. They are required to keep a record of who shipped the firearm. It’s also an appreciated courtesy to include your driver’s license details.

You also cannot become an FFL if you have previously been adjudicated mentally defective or incompetent, or have been committed to a mental institution.
If there's anything in your record that renders you ineligible, you may be able to remove that disability from your record by applying for relief and obtaining a pardon or expungement, or having a conviction set aside or your rights restored.;
, You can get an FFL application by visiting the ATF website and downloading a copy, or by going to your nearest ATF field office and requesting an application there.You also can download a guidance document issued by the ATF that is designed to answer questions about the FFL permit and help you determine whether your business needs one to legally sell firearms and ammunition.
Keep in mind that in addition to an FFL permit, you also must comply with the laws of the state in which your business is located. Your state may require other permits or background checks, and all of this must be in order before you will be able to operate legally.
Look over the application and read the instructions carefully before you fill it out.
Gather information before you begin, including information about your business and any others involved in your business, such as partners or managers, who also must be listed on your application.

, The FFL application requires information about your business, the type of sales you plan to make, the location and type of your business premises, its hours of operation, and everyone involved in your business.If your business has an EIN, you must enter it on the form. If you're operating as a sole proprietorship under your own Social Security number, you don't have to include your Social Security number on the application, although including it may enable your application to be processed more quickly.
If you're operating your business as a partnership (not an LLC or corporation), you must list the names of each partner on the top line of the application.
You may handwrite or type your answers. Print your forms on standard white paper and use black ink for your answers. If you're writing your answers, print with a ball-point pen.
You must complete and sign four copies of your application. Two of those copies will be for your own records.

, The ATF requires you to send a 2 x 2, passport-style photograph for yourself and each person listed on your application as a ""responsible person"" involved in your business.Rather than attempting to take these photos yourself, simply go to a booth where passport photos are made.
The photos have to meet the ATF's quality specifications, must be in color, and must show the whole face. Generally, if a photo meets passport specifications it will work for an FFL.

, The ATF conducts a fingerprint background check of you and every person listed on your application, so you must submit fingerprint cards.Fingerprints must be taken by a government law enforcement official on a standard fingerprint card.
Each fingerprint card should include the full legal name and signature of the person fingerprinted, along with a physical description of that person including race, height, weight, hair and eye color.
The fingerprint card also includes basic identification information about the person fingerprinted such as date of birth, Social Security number, and place of residence.
When you submit these cards, the ATF will inspect them for clarity. If your fingerprints don't come out well or the ink is smudged, get them taken again.

, Once you've completed your application and gathered the required photographs and fingerprint cards for every person listed on your application, you must submit the first copy to the ATF post office box listed on the application form.The copy you submit to the ATF must be accompanied by the appropriate application fee listed on the application – $200 if you're applying for a license to sell firearms in a retail, pawn shop, or other similar location.
Cash is not accepted, but you can pay your fees using a debit card, credit card, check, or money order. Your check or money order should be made payable to ""ATF.""
The application labeled ""Copy 3"" should be sent to the chief law enforcement officer of the precinct where your business is located.
The applications labeled ""Copy 2"" and ""Copy 4"" are for your own records. Keep them in a safe place with your other business records.
FFL applications are not transferable, so if you change the organization structure of your business, you must complete a new application for the new business. For example, if you begin your business as a sole proprietorship and later incorporate, you must get a new FFL license for the corporation.

, Once the ATF receives your application, your information will be entered into the database and electronic background checks will be conducted on each individual listed on the applications.When background checks are completed, the entire application package will be forwarded to the ATF field office in your area.
The field office supervisor assigns your application to an Industry Operations Investigator (IOI), who will interview you in person.
Expect the IOI to ask you questions about your business and discuss federal and state laws and regulations applicable to the sale of firearms and ammunition.
The IOI also will review the information you entered on your application to ensure it is current and accurate.
After your interview, the IOI will write up a report and recommend whether your license should be issued or denied.
Assuming the IOI recommends your license be issued, you can expect to receive your license within 60 days after all background checks and other application processing is complete. Your initial license is valid for three years.

, Before you complete the sell of a firearm or ammunition, you must call in a check to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) to ensure the potential purchaser is eligible to buy or possess a firearm.You can conduct a background check over the internet or by calling the NICS toll-free phone number.
The system is available 17 hours a day, seven days a week, except on Christmas Day.
If the background check does not come back with a ""proceed"" response, that person is not allowed to purchase a firearm and you cannot legally sell to them.

, When you buy or sell a firearm or ammunition, specific ATF forms and records must be completed in full and kept on file at your place of business.ATF Form 4473, ""Firearms Transaction Record,"" must be completed for each and every sale or transfer of a firearm conducted through your business.
These forms must be completed for each firearm, even if the same person purchases several guns.
The ATF has a best practices document that you can download from the bureau's website. This document provides a quick reference to the federal laws and regulations with which you must comply as an FFL.
If you conduct an inventory and find a firearm lost or stolen, you must file a ""lost or stolen firearm"" report within 24 hours of discovery.

, Federal law requires you to include a secure gun storage or safety device with each handgun you sell, and make gun locks and other safe storage devices available in your store.There are no federal standards regarding the safety or effectiveness of locks and safes. However, there are voluntary industry standards in effect.
Several states such as California and Massachusetts have laws concerning gun locks and safes and regulations implementing safety standards for locking devices.

, Transaction records allow law enforcement to trace a gun back to its original owner if the gun is confiscated or used in connection with criminal activity.If a firearm's serial number is traced back to your business, the law enforcement agency will submit a transaction report records request to you.
When you receive the request, you have 24 hours to respond and provide the appropriate documentation to law enforcement.

, While you have an active FFL, the ATF may inspect your premises without a warrant at any time during regular business hours as listed on your application to evaluate your inventory and check your transaction records.The ATF attempts to inspect every FFL at least once every six years, and every FFL located near the U.S./Mexico boarder at least once every three years.
An ATF investigator will review your records and ensure you have all the proper forms and records available on site.
The investigator also will observe sales to ensure proper procedures are followed during the transaction.
ATF investigators also may review your inventory records to ensure they match up with your transaction records and forms and all the firearms that have gone through your business have been properly accounted for.

, The ATF will mail a renewal application form and instructions to the address on your original license about 60 days before your original license is set to expire.You are responsible for getting a renewal application and submitting it in a timely manner so your license doesn't lapse.
If you haven't received a renewal package from the ATF, get one at the local field office or visit the bureau's website to download one.

, The renewal application requires essentially the same information as your original application. It must be filled out completely, even if the information hasn't changed from what you initially submitted.The renewal application requires much of the same information you already provided on your original application, but you should make sure what you enter on the renewal is current and up to date.
You can add people to a renewal application. However, since licenses are not transferable you cannot use a renewal application to change the name or business entity of the primary applicant.
In other words, if you applied for your license as a sole proprietor and have since added a partner, you can add that person's name to the renewal. However, if you reorganized your business as a corporation, you must file a new (rather than a renewal) application in the name of the corporation.
You don't have to complete a new or renewal application if you are moving your business to a new address in the same state. You must file the ATF Form to amend your FFL and submit your original license. You aren't allowed to operate in the new address until you receive your amended license.

, When you've completed your license and all required documentation, you must send it to the ATF post office box listed on the application form along with the required fee.If you submit your renewal application at least 90 days before the expiration date on your original license, you should receive your renewal license before the original expires.
The ATF charges a $90 fee for a three-year license renewal. Payment may be made by check, money order, credit or debit card. Checks or money orders should be made payable to ""ATF.""

, If you sent your renewal application before the date your license was set to expire, but have not yet received your renewal license, you can request a Letter of Authorization – also called a Letter of Continuing Authority to Operate or LOA – from the ATF.The LOA will allow you to continue to legally operate your business while your renewal is pending, including purchasing firearms and ammunition from other FFLs.
An LOA is only good for six months. If the six months lapses and you still haven't received a renewal license, you can request an extension of your LOA.
To be eligible to receive an LOA, your renewal application must be postmarked before the expiration date of your original license.

, Once the ATF has processed your renewal application, you will get your new license in the mail unless there are items on your application for which the ATF needs additional information.Someone from the ATF field office nearest you will contact you if there's a problem with your application or they need further information.
Keep in mind that submitting an incomplete application can result in a substantial delay of your new license, and may render you ineligible for an LOA.
Generally you can expect to get your license within 90 days of the date you submitted your renewal application, provided the information you provided is complete and accurate and you've included the correct fees.

Keep your antique firearms unloaded.",How to Legally Own an Antique Firearm," Since gun laws vary significantly from state to state, it's important to check the laws of the state in which you live before you buy an antique firearm. If you move to another state, don't assume the laws are the same and you can continue to legally own an antique firearm just because you legally owned it somewhere else.For example, anyone convicted of a felony is prohibited from buying a firearm. However, this prohibition doesn't apply to many antique firearms.
The types of guns included, however, depend on state law. Muzzle-loading rifles, shotguns, and pistols that use black powder rather than fixed ammunition generally can be purchased by felons.
However, if the weapons are converted so that they can fire fixed ammunition, they may not be allowed.
Additionally, many states have additional regulations regarding characteristics such as flintlocks, barrel length, and who may own them.;
, Most states exempt antique firearms from the general licensing and ownership requirements to legally own modern firearms. However, each state applies this exception in different ways, and may define ""antique firearm"" differently.Under federal law, an antique firearm is any firearm produced before 1898. The federal definition also includes replicas, which means the firearm may have been manufactured recently, but if it was manufactured to exactly duplicate a firearm produced before 1898, it is still considered an antique firearm.
Most states use the same definition as federal law. However, some states include newer firearms as well.
In these states, a firearm is considered an antique if it was manufactured more than 50 years ago and is not still being manufactured.
With these relatively newer weapons that are still considered antiques, there may be additional restrictions on their ownership. Typically that depends on the type of ammunition they use.

, If you're unsure about how the exception applies, of if you are eligible to purchase or own an antique firearm legally, speaking to someone such as a federal firearms licensee can help you understand the law.The state government agency that regulates firearms typically will be your most reliable source. You can identify this agency by searching on the internet or asking a licensed gun dealer near you.
If you don't feel comfortable calling up the state agency, a licensed gun dealer near you usually can give you full information about the laws in your state.
You also may be able to find out about your ability to legally own an antique firearm by talking to an attorney, such as a criminal defense attorney. If you've been convicted of a felony, this may be your best resource.

, Typically, you don't need a license to buy or own an antique firearm. However, not being licensed limits your ability to use or transport your gun, and you may not be able to sell it to others.A state license generally is a ""license to carry,"" meaning you need the license if, for example, you want to take your antique firearm to a local shooting range and fire it.
Some states such as Massachusetts have exempted antique firearms from the license to carry.
However, before you rely on this you should check to make sure that your antique firearm falls within the licensing exemption, which may differ from the purchase or possession exemption.
When you buy your antique firearm, think about the reason for your purchase and what you anticipate doing with it. If you're a collector who intends to hang it on your wall or display it in a case, and knows you're never going to attempt to fire it, you shouldn't need a license in most states.

, If you want to collect antique firearms and plan on buying and selling them on a regular basis, a curios and relics license will allow you to do that more efficiently.A C&R license is a type of federal firearms license (FFL) that allows you to buy and sell antique firearms directly without having to go through a licensed dealer.
The license is issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF). You can download a copy of the application from the ATF's website.
A C&R license allows you to buy and sell antique firearms, including any firearm that is at least 50 years old or that has historical or collectible significance.
Once you get your license, you must keep records of each firearm you buy or sell, including the make, model, serial number, and type of firearm. You also must record the name and address (or FFL number) of the buyer or seller of the weapon.

, You can find numerous antique firearms available online, at pawn shops, or in other locations. However, without knowing the dealer's reputation you can't be sure that you're actually getting what you've paid for.If you have a C&R license, you'll have to get details about the person from whom you're buying the firearm for your records.
However, apart from that information, you should be able to find out basic information about the reputation of this particular seller before you buy an antique firearm from them.
While this isn't necessarily a legal consideration, it can be if someone sells you a firearm claiming that it is an antique, when it really isn't – particularly if you don't have a license to buy or possess modern firearms.

, If you're a collector, or if you're concerned about the collectible or historical value of a particular antique firearm, an independent appraisal can let you know what you're getting and how much it's worth.Who you contact for an appraisal depends on the type of firearm you're purchasing. If you're only concerned about the age of the weapon, you want to find an antique firearms expert.
Your local gun dealer may be able to point you to someone who specializes in dating antique firearms.
If the antique firearm is alleged to have particular historical significance, you will want to have it evaluated by a museum curator or historian who specializes in that particular period of time or type of weaponry.

, State and federal laws cover the shipping or transport of firearms from one state to another, and from another country into the United States. Even if your seller is located in the same state as you, your state may have specific legal requirements for transporting the weapon.If you have a C&R license, you don't have to worry about transport restrictions if you're buying and selling within your own state.
However, to transport an antique firearm across state lines, you typically must use a federal firearms licensee within the state where the firearm is located. That licensee can then transfer the firearm to you, or to a federal firearms licensee in your state to deliver to you.
If you want to import an antique firearm (or ammunition) from another country, this also must be done by a registered firearm dealer.
The ATF provides forms which must be completed prior to making an international purchase or sale and transfer. Visit the ATF website to download those documents.
If the firearm you wish to transport is more than 100 years old, it is eligible for duty-free transport internationally. However, you must be able to provide proof of age.

, When selling one of your antique firearms, you typically must go through a federal firearms licensee to complete the transfer. In some states, you may be allowed to make the sale at a local law enforcement agency.States have different laws regarding private sales between two private individuals. Many states require you to complete the sale using a federal firearms licensee, but some do not.
For example, suppose you see an antique firearm on an online auction site that you want to purchase. Your state law controls how the final transfer of the weapon can be made.
Generally it can't simply be shipped to you. Instead, you must meet with the seller in person to take possession of the antique firearm.
Talk to a gun dealer in your area or contact the state agency that regulates and enforces state gun laws to learn if you must use a federal firearms licensee to complete private transactions.

, Each state has specific laws regarding the storage of firearms, whether antique or modern. Some cities have their own gun laws as well, which may further restrict how you can store your antique firearms.In some states, antique firearms are not exempted from state storage laws. However, others carve out an exemption for antiques being displayed for collection purposes, provided they are not loaded.
Generally, you should avoid keeping even antique firearms where children can reach them or take them down to play with them.
Keep in mind that children are naturally curious, and will want to inspect anything within their reach.

, All states have requirements for the safe transportation of a weapon. Even if you move, or are taking your antique firearm out of state yourself, there may be restrictions on how you can transport your weapon across state lines.If you're transporting your antique firearms because you're moving to another state, make sure they're secured properly and safely, and are not loaded while they are being transported.
In some instances, particularly if you don't have a license yourself, you may be required to ship your antique firearm to a federal firearms licensee. They will return the weapon to you when you arrive at your destination.
When you're traveling between states, more than one state's laws may come into play. If you don't want to go through the hassle of trying to analyze the gun laws of several states, it may be easiest to arrange for your antique firearm to be shipped to a federal firearms licensee so you can pick it up when you arrive at your destination.

, If you give or loan your antique firearm to anyone else, you typically must go through a federal firearms licensee – even if it isn't a sell and no money is exchanging hands.This typically will not apply if you have a C&R license – in that case you can complete the transfer yourself. However, if the person to whom you're transferring the firearm is not licensed, you may need to find a federal firearms licensee to receive the firearm for them.
For example, suppose you have an antique firearm and you want to give it to your nephew, who has recently started collecting antique firearms.
Even though no money is changing hands, you may need to go through a federal firearms licensee if you don't have a license yourself.
However, if you do have a license, you should be able to complete the transfer on your own.
Contact a gun dealer near you if you are unsure whether you can transfer your antique firearm to someone else. They will let you know what your state law allows.

, Many state laws do not allow antique firearms to be stored loaded. Particularly if the gun uses black powder, these weapons are highly volatile and dangerous if they're loaded but not fired.In some states and cities, any ammunition you own must be kept in a separate, locked container from the antique firearm itself.
Keep in mind that the idea that collectors typically don't intend to use antique firearms in the same way or for the same purposes people have modern firearms is part of the reason for the exemption from various licensing requirements.
States that allow gun owners to keep loaded weapons for self-defense purposes typically do not allow muzzle-loaded weapons that use black powder for ammunition to be kept loaded. You should only ""load"" a black-powder weapon if you intend to fire it immediately.
If your muzzle-loaded weapon has been converted so that it can fire standard bullets, it may not be considered an antique firearm as a result of that modification.

Find a fresh water source.,
Collect food from the plants on the island.,
Hunt for fish, insects, and small animals for food.,
Test the food you eat for poison.,
Ration all of your supplies.",How to Survive on a Desert Island1," People can't survive for more than three or four days without fresh water.Go inland and try to find a water source from a stream or waterfall on the island. If it's completely barren, then you'll need to create a solar still and take advantage of rainfall when it occurs.


A solar still uses the sun to create condensation. Dig a hole in the ground and put a container at the bottom. Surround the hole with wet leaves, then put a large piece of plastic down over the hole and weigh it down. Condensation will collect in your container and you'll be able to drink it. When it rains, make sure that you are filling up containers to catch the fresh water to keep you hydrated for the long run. Boil the water before you drink it.
Check for water at the base of leaves or cacti, inside of caves, hollowed trees, or undercut banks.You can also get water from coconuts, cacti, or other plants and fruits.Collect rainwater in buckets, plastic containers, bins, or garbage cans.
Heating the water above 185° F (85° C) for three minutes will kill all pathogens in your water.Severe dehydration could cause low blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, rapid breathing, delirium, or unconsciousness.Do not drink salt water from the ocean because it will dehydrate you.;
, While your body is capable of surviving one to three weeks without any food, not eating will weaken you, and it will make it harder to do other things that are required to survive on a desert island.Eat fruits and vegetables that you know not to be poisonous like coconuts, bananas, and seaweed. Avoid potentially poisonous, unknown berries.


Scurvy is a serious condition that occurs when you don't have a balanced diet. Symptoms include fatigue, anemia, and infections and is caused by a vitamin C deficiency.Eating fresh citrus fruits like lemons and oranges can help prevent the condition., The protein and nutrients from meat and fish will give you energy. Mollusks, clams, oysters, crabs, muscles, and fish are all things that you may be able to find in the shallow waters surrounding or on an island.You can sharpen sticks and hunt small reptiles, fish, or birds in the isle as well.If you're having trouble catching or trapping bigger game, locate slower moving insects that you can eat that live in the desert like beetles, spiders, and centipedes.Cook shellfish thoroughly before consuming it. Bacteria could cause you to become ill.
If you cannot create a makeshift fishing pole, then sharpen a long branch or stick to make spears that you can use to go spearfishing., If you've never eaten the fruit that you find on the island, test it for poison by rubbing it on a sensitive part of your skin, like your wrist. Wait 45 minutes. If there is no adverse reaction, rub some of the food on your lips. If you form a rash, or there is burning or irritation, then the food is most likely poisonous. Never eat large amounts of any unknown food. Eat a small amount, wait an hour or two to see if you feel sick, then eat the rest of it.Beware of fruit that smells like peaches or almonds as it could be poisonous., Do not waste anything, even if you have an overabundance of it. Store away your excess food and water and stick to strict rationing. The body requires 32 ounces of water a day and 200-1500 calories of food for an average person.Try to ration as much as possible without becoming dehydrated or malnourished.

Salvage any remaining tools or supplies.,
Locate a suitable location to set up camp.,
Construct a sturdy shelter.,
Make a fire.,
Attend to any wounds immediately.,
Keep mentally active and stay hopeful.",How to Survive on a Desert Island2," Salvage anything from the wreck that left you on the island. Bedding or cloth can be used for string, and other materials can be adapted in similar ways to provide footwear, bedding, or help with building shelter. Make sure to find something sharp so that you can use it to cut materials.Look for other useful things like radios, flares, flotation devices, cell phones, buckets to store water, first aid kits, or other working electronic equipment.

, Going inland is a good idea when building your shelter. Don't make your shelter on the shore or else flooding could destroy it and your remaining supplies. Aim for wooded areas around fresh water sources.The shade from overhanging leaves will keep you cool during the day, and the trees will provide a natural barrier to the elements.
Stay out of the sun for an extended period. Heat exhaustion or overheating could cause you to hallucinate, pass out, or even die., You can build a place to sleep by leaning a large log against a tree, then setting smaller branches at a 45-degree angle on the wood. Put foliage and leaves over the top of your sticks and you've built a makeshift tent.If you're able to find a tarp or piece of plastic or cloth, then you can also construct a desert tarp. Drive four stakes in a square shape into the sand. Tie your tarp in place and then tie another tarp on top of it, leaving around 2 inches of distance between them. To ensure that the stakes stay in the ground, you can tie the top of them to logs, trees, or rocks in order to anchor them.There are other shelters that you can construct from logs and leaves. Whatever you do, make sure that it protects you from the sun's rays.
Salvaged plastic tarps are more efficient at keeping the elements out of your shelter.

, A fire will is necessary during the cold nights, and to cook any fish or animals that you catch. If you've salvaged any matches or lighters, wait for them to dry before trying to use them. If you don't have any supplies to start a fire, then you may have to start one by rubbing a sharpened stick into a pile of kindling. Read Start-a-Fire-with-Sticks to learn how to do this.

, Injuries and sickness are much more dangerous when you're alone on an island that does not have medical treatment. Make sure to attend to any injuries immediately by washing cuts out with fresh, clean water, and keeping them wrapped with bandages. Be careful not to overexert yourself because a broken bone could become fatal.


Make sure to boil the water that you're using to clean any wounds before you use it.

, Extreme isolation can cause irregular sleeping patterns, altered logical and verbal reasoning, and losing a sense of time.Work on projects that need to be completed around camp or devise new methods to escape the island. Channel your creative side during any downtime by creating art with salvaged materials. If there are people around you, stay social and maintain and communicate with the people that are around you.

Create a distress signal.,
Try to contact someone via radio.,
Use a raft to leave the island yourself.",How to Survive on a Desert Island3," Create three large fires in a triangle when it's dark out to create the international distress signal. Should any nearby planes or boats see this, they should contact the Coast Guard.If you've managed to salvage any leftover flares, make sure to use them when you see a vessel nearby.Another distress signal is to gather stones from the island and position them in the sand to read SOS., If you've managed to salvage a working radio, you may be able to contact the coast guard to rescue you. If you manage to get someone else on the line, give them your coordinates and tell them to contact the coast guard.


Channel 9 on CB radio and Channel 16 on VHF radio (156.8 MHz) are widely recognized distress channels.Some radios come with tracking hardware called an emergency positioning radio indicating beacon, that can determine your location offshore., Leaving the island yourself on a raft should be your last resort. At sea, you are susceptible to a multitude of problems including dehydration, starvation, or succumbing to the elements. You can use any salvaged rafts that you were able to recover, build one out of salvaged materials, or build one out of logs that you find in the area.Read Build-a-Log-Raft to learn more about building a log raft.

Gather items that have washed up.,
Obtain fresh water.,
Build a solar water still.,
Search for food.,
Try to find natural shelter.,
Build a lean-to shelter.,

Keep your fire going.",How to Survive on a Tropical Island," Have a look around and see what else washed up with you. You might be able to find some supplies that could be used to help you.


If you have a life raft, you can use the plastic from this to help you with water.
If there is a first aid kit in the raft, you might need it if you get cut or sick.
Any plastic containers, tubing, flashlights, mirrors, sharp objects etc. could come in handy.
If there is a flare gun, save this and put it in a safe place. You might be able to use it if you see a passing ship or aircraft.;
, Finding a reliable source of fresh, drinkable water should be your first priority after you get your bearings and collect anything that washed up with you. Dehydration is your biggest danger when stranded. Venture inland to find a stream or pond.
If you are stranded on a relatively large island, your likelihood of finding a freshwater stream or waterfall is more likely.
If you can't find fresh water inland, you can collect rainwater.
Collect rainwater in any containers you have or find from debris or washing up on the shore.
You can also collect rainwater in large leaves and funnel it into a container.

, If you can't find any suitable fresh water, collect enough rainwater, or you just want another backup source of water, you can build one of these to collect more fresh water. You can build one of these if you have a container and plastic sheet.
Dig a pit about 3 or 4 feet in diameter at a depth of 3 feet.
At the center of the hole, dig a depression in the size and shape of a container you will collect water in.
Place your container in the hole in the center.
Place vegetation or leaves in the hole around the container. As the air heats in the hole, leaves or plants will help more moisture to collect.
Drape a plastic sheet over the hole and anchor it down on the edges with rocks.
Place a rock on the plastic in the center just above the container.
Over the next few hours, moisture will build up in the pit from the heat and leaves. This will condense on the plastic and drip into the container.
The water collected in the container will be safe to drink.

, Don't venture too far into the jungle as you never know what is in there.


You could look for fruits but make sure you recognise these fruits as edible ones.
Your best bet for food will likely be fish that live in the shallow pools at the beach. The water should be shallow enough to walk through and look for fish.
The best method of catching these is spear fishing. Create a spear from a long thin branch that is sharpened at one end.
Stand on rocks when you spear fish to avoid disturbing the water and alarming the fish.
Spear the fish quickly, aiming for the head. Try to spear fish that are still as you are more likely to hit them.

, You need to find shelter for protection from the elements and predators. You don't know what lives on the island. Wild animals, especially predators, can pose a distinct threat.
You will want to avoid the elements. Getting too wet isn't good even in warm conditions.
It doesn't have to be fancy, just safe. Look for natural shelter such as rock outcroppings for temporary shelter until you can build a better structure.

, This type of shelter consists of a large felled tree or branch braced against a large rock wall or standing tree. Find a large branch and brace it securely against a large tree.
Place smaller branches at 45 degree angles along the larger branch.
Drop leaves and foliage over the shelter to provide cover and additional protection from the elements.
This can be a temporary shelter until you build a more secure tee-pee type of shelter.

, This is a more secure and permanent type of shelter which provides optimal protection from animals and the elements. Gather 10-20 long branches. The thicker these are, the stronger the structure will be.
Stick 3 of the branches into the ground to create a tripod.
Place the remaining branches in a circle around the tripod, leaving room for an entrance.
Cover the structure with leaves, brush, and other foliage for protection.

, You need to keep warm, even if it's warm during the day.It could get cold at night, so it is best to have a source of warmth.
You will especially need a fire if you get wet from rain. It is important to stay as dry as possible.
Also, the smoke might attract passing ships but keep it under control.
Find tinder such as small dry twigs, grasses, and flammable debris. Arrange smaller twigs in a tripod with tinder underneath.
Light the fire using a mirror, binoculars, or reflective surface by reflecting sunlight onto the dry kindling.

, For this method you will need a piece of soft wood, tinder, and a hard stick. Take the piece of soft wood and dig a groove into it with the stick.
Place tinder on the end of the soft wood that you want to ignite.
Using the hard stick, plow up and down the groove in the wood to create friction.
When the tinder begins to ignite or smoke, blow on it to create bigger flames.
Place small twigs on top of the ignited tinder to create a larger fire.

, If you have a mobile phone, see if you have any signal.


Travel to higher ground to search for signal.
If you manage to make a call, contact someone back home and tell them what happened and whereabouts you are.
If you don't know where you are, look for landmarks on the horizon.
If you can't find a cellphone signal, then explore the island carefully to see if there are any inhabitants with a radio or boat.

, You might have bright plastic or a flare gun.


Make flags from any bright colored material. These could be spotted during the day by a low flying aircraft.
Keep the flare gun in a safe place that is quickly accessible. You will want to fire a flare if you see a passing ship or plane.
You can also try to make reflected light signals with a large mirror if one washed up with you.

, If there is a sandy area, make a giant SOS sign on the beach.


Find large tree branches that you can arrange to spell SOS in the sand. This can be noticed by a passing airplane.
You can also arrange large rocks in the same fashion.
If you can't find enough material such as branches or rocks, you can write this message in the sand in big letters with a stick or even your hand.
Keep in mind that you might have to fix this daily as the tide could wash parts of it away.

, The smoke and light could be noticed by passing aircraft or boats. Be careful your fire is not too big, as it could be potentially hazardous to you, your shelter, and wildlife.
Keep your fire as close to shore as possible so smoke can be seen by passing ships.
Try to keep it going throughout the night so aircraft can spot the flames from above.

Find water.,
Make friends with trees.,
Cut some Basswood bark.,
Go mudding.,
Invite some friends.,
Make fire.,
Build a shelter.,
Stay conscious of the fire.,
Look for breakfast.,
Tighten that belt.,
Follow that water.",How to Survive the Wilderness With Just a Knife," First things first, you are stranded somewhere in a temperate wilderness during late morning, the worst case is that you do not know where you are. That is not a problem. You don't know where you are, but you know where you want to go...downhill. This is because water is held stringently by the laws of gravity and you want water first as you can only survive three days without it. Move to the lowest point you can find.;
, On your way downhill, educate yourself of three different trees.


White Birch. Look for a white tree with a paper-like material coming from it. This is an important tree, it's called the White Birch. Not only is the inner bark edible, but the outer bark can be used as a waterproof container (if it doesn't have any holes in it). Also, most people don't know this but you can cut a hole in the tree and get a spicy sweet sap a lot like a maple. Some other useful attributes are a follows:
One can cook soup in birch bark as it will not burn with liquid inside it.

Birch bark can be used as temporary rope


Birch bark, the white papery layer, makes excellent tinder for fire lighting

The white birch can be carved into a good walking stick.

Birch bark has been used in the making of native canoes.



American Basswood The second tree you should know is called a Basswood. This tree is really easy to recognize. It has grey, sometimes veiny bark and some of the largest heart-shaped leaves to boot. Do not get this tree confused with a moose maple, which has leaves with three points. This tree is important, as it is going to be your source of rope, snares, straps and ultimately your backpack. You will start to see this tree as you get closer to water, it's thirstier than you are and can also be a source of water if you don't feel daft sucking on the side of a tree.
Common Maple. The third and final tree you need to know is the common Maple. This is going to be your walking stick as well as your protection. It is a very hard wood with a clean grey-looking bark. Now picture a Canadian flag in your head, that is a maple leaf. If you don't know what a Canadian flag looks like, suggestion is to pick up a book and find out before you go into the woods.

, If there is no water, move to the base of a hill or a mountain where a stream or river will most likely run near its base. This is where that tree lesson will come in handy.


Find a Basswood. As stated above, they love water and high banks.
Use your knife to cut a horizontal line all the way around the trunk. Do this at the bottom and about four feet above that.
Now cut one straight vertical line from the top line to the bottom one.
Observe that the top line looks like a T where the two lines meet. This T is where you will dig your two thumbnails into the tree.
Now gently pull these two flaps away from the white wood below. You should now have a curved floppy rectangle.
Now the easy part:
Cut this strip into as many smaller vertical strips as you can. Ideally they should be about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) wide.
Now flip these strips over to reveal a wet shiny layer. This the layer you will use for the rope.

Carefully pull the green outer bark away from this thin sheet of wood. Observe that the green part will be significantly thicker than the thin material that you want.
Wrap these thin strips around themselves so that they each make a ring about 3 inches (7.6 cm) in diameter.
Use your green junk to wrap up about three quarters of your new rope.
Place this wide jumble of rope around your wrist so it will be out of the way.
Use the other 1/4 of your rope to make shoulder straps, a belt, and most importantly a bicep strap to go on your upper arm for your knife.
All your green bark scrap should be saved and strapped to you otherwise, using your new lashing or other strips of bark.
After all that work you will most likely be thirsty. Luckily all you have to do is go downhill to get some much-deserved water.

, While you're getting some water, there is a very important step that will save you a lot of grief latter. While you're near water, it is important for you to cover yourself in a thin sheet of blue clay or dirt if no clay is available. This layer must cover every piece of open skin. This layer will be your only defense against black flies, deer flies and ticks. The best advice that can be given is to enjoy yourself, this step is very important and seriousness will not help your morale nor your situation. Enjoy the inner child you left behind.

, After you have your armor, it's now time to set some snares. Find game trails, which should be littered all around the banks of your water source. Take off around 6 of your strips and tie a 1-inch diameter loop at the end. Slip the other end of your Basswood snare through this loop and prop it up above the ground at a level appropriate for the game trail you are occupying. Small trails speak towards small game, large trails should be avoided. For rabbit, raccoon, quail and partridge, place the snare 4–10 inches (10.2–25.4 cm) above the ground. For added measure, one can rub mud around this loop to disguise the scent and the appearance of the freshly wrought basswood.

, Now if the day is getting late, your best bet is to make a fire. It is often best to gather a lot of dry wood first, with sizes ranging from twigs to small logs. For multiple fire starter methods, type ""how to make a fire"" into the wikiHow search directory. The fire bow method works particularly well with basswood.
Before lighting your fire, clear a 6-foot circle around your fire site. Choose a location without branches immediately above the fire. Collect as many head-sized stones as possible to ring the fire and keep it from spreading. However, a ring of rocks will trap and reflect heat inward making it easier to keep going. One of the most important aspects to remember about fire is to respect it. Keep it contained.
Once you have your fire, it is important to keep the flame below two feet, that way your fire will not take much in the way of fuel. You do not want to go back into the forest for more wood. Insects will maraud you. Your thin coat of mud or clay will block their bites but not their sound. On a psychological level, the simple fact that they could still get in your eyes and ears should keep you well stocked before you start your fire.

, One does not really need a shelter in average conditions. However if you do need one, or expect rain, the main thing is to keep it small, dry and off the ground. Never spend time building small cabins or even a shelter bigger than your body. This is a waste of energy and resources, and it's easier to keep heat captured in a smaller space. Large clumps of moss that you can use to cover a small wooden skeleton work well. Also, Birch bark makes for an excellent shingle. Your best bet, however, is to use massive amounts of softwood and ferns. If you are quick, you can gather enough for a six-inch barrier that will shed rain as well as hold heat. Dry leaves also work very well for water-proofing. If you are expecting rain, make the layer of leaves and whatever as thick as possible. (3 feet is almost completely water-proof.) In two hours one cannot only sleep comfortably but dry and warm.

, As you sleep, make sure you are aware of just how far away your fire is. Grogginess could have you lying right on top of it with no one there to put you out. If you do not feel comfortable with a fire going while you sleep, you can put it out and dig a hole where you are to sleep and fill it with the coals. By putting a layer of dirt over this spot you can lie on top of it and sleep very comfortably.

, When you wake, be aware that insects come out a dawn. Now is the time to pick up your metabolism and move quickly, as the insects can still get in your eyes. Also, movement trains your body to provide its own heat through exertion. The only problem is that one's motivation to move is usually lacking. Your motivation should stem from the fact that you had set 6 snares the previous day and one of them might hold breakfast lunch and dinner. So to raise your body heat, move from snare to snare. You may have gotten lucky.

, Now it is important to prepare yourself for two contingencies.


The first is that you got absolutely nothing and have a very hungry and downtrodden demeanor. If this is the case, simply go to your nearby Birch tree and cut a 4-inch triangle out of the bark. Turn one point towards the ground. You can eat the underside of this bark, as it is very nutritious. Also, a small trickle of sugary sap comes out of the bottom point of this triangle. Don't worry if it's not much. Surprisingly, a human can survive off a tablespoon of food a day for a limited time.
The second contingency is that you got something, most likely a rabbit or a small game bird. There is a pretty good rule for eating things on animals: Don't eat anything that looks inedible. Otherwise, almost anything's fair game if you cook it well enough.
Here's another rule with food: Don't eat where you sleep or sleep where you eat. Scraps and entrails will attract predators (ie bears). Discard bones, entrails, beaks, etc., far from your shelter.

, Now that you know how to gather food and water, it is important to recognize the other use of rivers. Humanity was not build upon the backs of man, but on the banks of rivers. To find humanity, simply follow your river downstream. Remember not all streams lead to civilization, the stream could end up going underground for miles and then you would have wasted a lot of your energy on nothing. Using all of the things stated above, a person can live indefinitely in the woods.

Find out whether or not the glass is load-bearing.,
Check the thickness of the glass.,
Check the glass for cracks, broken edges, or any other signs of wear.,
Avoid walking on a glass roof when the conditions are not favorable.,
Keep safe by using safety equipment.,
Move evenly and carefully across the glass.,
Be careful about what you carry with you when you don't know the load-bearing.",How to Walk on a Glass Roof Safely," This is the very first thing that you should investigate if you're planning to work on it. If you don't have time to learn this, such as during an emergency, then it is recommended that you don't walk on it but that you use scaffolding, boards or planks, or other crossing over supports to walk on that sit above the glass and rest on the edges supporting the glass rather than on the glass itself.


Load bearing glass will be used anywhere where it is expected that people will walk on the glass, such as scenic glass where people are able to stand and look down through the glass, roof terraces with pedestrian access, and glass roof lights that are placed where walking usually occurs. Be aware that not all fixed flat roof lights can be walked on though; only some have this ability and come with very thick laminated glass if they're to be walked on.Less certain are roofs made of glass, such as conservatories and greenhouses. However, in most cases these should have areas where you can lay a plank or board across if needed. Obviously, if you're working over such a roof, such as doing painting or guttering work, you're best off using scaffolding rather than attempting to stand on such a roof.
For modern buildings and retrofitted buildings, check the building code applicable to your area. It should determine what glass was required for the roof you're wanting to walk on.;
, The thicker the glass, the more likely it is that it should be able to take your weight.


You want to measure the edge of the glass if possible. The glass thickness might be safe to walk on if it is 1/2 an inch to 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) in thickness.However, glass that is meant to be walked on usually needs to be laminated, or layered with other items, in order to strengthen it properly. Ordinary glass is not meant to withstand a heavy human weight.
Call a structural engineer or a glass roof installer for more advice. Except in an emergency, it is better to know than to make an avoidable error.

, Be aware of anywhere that might need to be avoided if you plan on crossing a glass roof where you're not sure about its load-bearing capacity.


Stand under the roof an look as well as peering over it.
Mark any areas with cracks so that you are aware to avoid them and others are too.
Use something to magnify your sight to see hairline cracks, etc.

, You should never walk on a glass roof that has ice on it. And glass roofs can be slippery when wet from rain or hosing down. Also beware of wind whenever you're on a roof of any kind.


If the reason you want to walk on a glass roof is because it has iced over, use a tool to remove the ice, not you. Find a safe place to stand, such as through a window or from a ladder and use a hot water jet to cut into sections of the ice. Keep watering to flood the ice so that it will unhook and slide off (be sure nobody is underneath or likely to walk underneath before starting this).

, Wear a safety harness as a back up in case anything fails when you cannot verify the load-bearing capacity and the walkable nature of the glass roof. Rely on ladders, a spotter or two, and scaffolding as additional safety mechanisms. Even if the glass is load-bearing, it is still a slippery surface and care must always be taken when walking on it, especially where it is sloped or angled.


Have your cell phone with you in case you get into trouble and cannot be heard clearly from the roof. With wind, height, and angles, your shouts or voice may not be easily heard from below.
Wear non-slip shoes with covered toes and wear socks and long pants just in case there is a break; this adds more protection for your skin.

, Avoid jumping or running on the glass unless you're absolutely certain it is load-bearing glass. Walk with care, take your time, and note where your feet are placed.

, Anything heavy in your arms will clearly increase your overall weight and might cause you to fall through where you might have crossed easily without the added weight. Have others hand you tools or equipment needed from a ladder if you're performing a rescue operation.

Assess the item you want to purchase first and foremost.,
Get ready!,
Gather together supplies.,
Bring a buddy.,
Check it out beforehand.,
Dress accordingly.,
Set up your spot on arrival.,
Try to sleep if you can, as hard as that sounds.,
Wake early and stay alert.",How to Camp out Overnight in Line," Make sure you call the store beforehand and find out how many of the items they have, what time the store opens, and if they will be handing your pre-order tickets (many places do now, to avoid possible chaos). If there are only a dozen game systems available and you are the 20th person, it's not worth your time to stay out all night.;
, Start preparations as soon as you know what you're getting and what day the pre-order/shipment is. Make sure do not have commitments for the night of the purchase and the day after. No school, work, parties etc. You'll be too exhausted for any of this after the event!

, This varies on where you live and what time of year it is, but keeping in mind it will usually be around the holidays, and most likely cold, you will need to think ahead. See the ""Things You'll Need"" list for supplies.

, If at all possible, bring a friend, husband, wife, girl/boyfriend, sibling, co worker - anyone! There is safety in numbers and you will have someone to hold your place in line during a food run or much needed bathroom break. If you can't do that, try to seek out a friend in line. Although there can be unsavory people, the chances that hardcore shoppers will stick together in keeping away stragglers cannot be discounted.

, If at all possible, drive to the location the day before. Seek out possible bathrooms, coffee shops and 24-hour locations. If nothing else, you will want someplace to warm up. If there are no 24/7 grocery stores, look for convenience stores.

, When you are ready for the big day, start early and dress warmly! Three layers on top plus a coat (sweater and turtle necks), two layers on bottom (jogging pants/flannel pants and jeans), a hoodie and hat, gloves, scarf, wool or double layers of socks and warm shoes. Bring blankets as well, three at least per person, and sleeping bags if you have them. And get to the location as fast as you can - some hardcore shoppers will camp out the afternoon before the day of the release!

, When you arrive chances are you won't be the first person there. Set up camp, say hello to everyone, and ask what they are there for. Find out your place in the line. Remain kind and respectful to your fellow shoppers - you'll go through a lot together that night!

, Walk around to stay warm. If you're with a partner, take car breaks/bathroom breaks, do a snack or food run and keep an eye on the time.

, As you near 5AM, stay awake and do not leave the line! The manager may be out to hand pre-sale tickets out, and you do not want to miss this - you have been camping out all night for these!

"
"
Study a map of the area where you want to walk.,
Check the weather report.,
Take basic safety items.,
Make a Plan B.,
Tell someone you trust of your plans.",How to Take a Walk in the Woods Alone,"

Buy a map or a trail guide. The best place to find these is a good outdoor outfitter.
Choose a trail or a woods road that is marked on a US Geological Survey map or a trail map.
Calculate how long you will need to cover the distance you want to cover. A good rule of thumb for all weather, terrain, and conditions is 1 mile (1.6 km) an hour. In winter, progress will be even slower than this.;
, Dress properly for the predicted conditions. The woods will feel colder than civilization.

Take a wool or fleece sweater if the temperature will dip below 68 degrees F.
Carry a raincoat in a small backpack. It can come in handy as a ground cloth if you sit down for a period.
Very stormy day? Stay home and go another time.
Light rain? Walking with an umbrella works well as long as it's not windy.
Be prepared to remove or add layers as you go or stop to rest.

, Consider bringing:

A compass, if you know how to use it.
A good understanding of where north, south, east, and west are by the sun-- almost as good as a compass.
Cell phone. Be aware that reception could be poor. And do not fall into the idea that if you get lost, a quick call will bring rescuers out very quickly. Most local rescue groups will come to you as fast as they can, but you might be waiting for a while, even hours, depending on where you are. The cell phone is a backup.
A basic first-aid kit that includes bandages, painkiller, Benadryl, and an ace bandage.
A flashlight. You probably won't need it. However, if you miscalculate with time, or turn your ankle and are getting out of the woods more slowly than you intended, the sun will go down, and the flashlight will be a giant help.
A snack and a bottle of water.
A whistle and a pocket knife with scissors. You probably won't use either one on a walk of a few hours. But if you need to communicate quickly, or if you need to cut first-aid tape or moleskin in your kit, the knife will be very helpful.
Bring matches or fire starter. Most people never need these, but in an emergency, knowing how to build a fire is a useful skill.

, Maybe even a Plan C or D. Walking alone in the woods means you can go at your own pace, you can be quiet and get a lot of thinking done, and you are responsible only for yourself. But with this comes the necessity of being flexible. You might not be feeling peppy that day. Or the weather changes. Or your boss calls and says get into the office.

If the weather turns bad before you start walking, Plan B is: go another day. The woods will be there later.
If you plan to walk out to a point and then turn around, decide ahead of time what time you want to be finished with your walk, and turn around roughly halfway through the time you have available. So let's say your progress is slower than you thought. Plan C: turn around sooner. Of course, adjust plans for terrain. If the walk in goes up a hill or mountain, the hike out likely will take less time--although that's not always the case. Consult a trail guide for a description of the paths you are taking.
If you plan to walk in a loop on established back roads, multi-use trails or narrow paths, take a guidebook with you and note the landmarks. If you feel the ground isn't looking the way you expected and you're not sure about the rest of the route, go to an alternate plan. Turn around and retrace your steps.
Do not continue if you lose the path. Turn around and go back to the last place where the path was marked. Most woods paths are marked with colored markers on trees or painted blazes. Intersections often will be marked with signs or more painted markers.

, Tell them when you intend to be out of the woods, and tell them where you parked your vehicle. If you don't come out when they expect you, they can call for help. This kind of thing happens rarely, but it does happen. Some people who get lost or hurt or worse would have been safe if they'd left their plans with  someone who could send for help soon after you don't show up."

Walk with a rolling fashion.,
When walking up a hill or grade, if the ground is dry and has traction, maintain the rolling walking technique.

,
Use a walking stick when going uphill so you can keep your balance and keep the rolling, walking movement.,
Walk uphill in a different route which is more step-like or less slippery (so you can walk in a rolling fashion).

,
Make a heel cup, have a shoe repair person add some height to your heel, or make a makeshift insole.",How to Treat Achilles Tendinitis in the Wilderness," A rolling fashion is where you initially land on your heel, your weight transfers to the front of your foot and your heel lifts up before you swing your leg forward. Lifting your heel up is the crucial technique element to do.;
,, Obviously, to maintain maximum traction and contact with the ground, you might want to keep your foot flat on the ground and slide it forward, but by doing this you are stressing your Achilles tendon.

,,


Make heel cups out of cardboard. Heel cups which are minimal should be the least uncomfortable. You want to elevate your heel, a bit. The cupping of the heel prevents the cardboard underneath from sliding to the front of your shoes.
Have a shoemaker add 1⁄8 or 1⁄4 inch (0.3 or 0.6 cm) to your heel - an easy and inexpensive modification that will also add life to your shoes.
With paper glue make insoles out of cardboard with several layers under the heel and just one layer throughout the insole. A cardboard insole will not last long.

Pick up empty casings from where you shoot or from a gun range which allows you to collect brass.,
Sort the casings, the level of sorting (before cleaning) depends on the calibers being used.,
Clean the casings.,
Sort the casings into separate calibers.",How to Hand Load Ammunition1,"


You want to pick up the cleanest brass possible (though it isn't terribly important), but the main issues when picking up brass is collecting the correct caliber, making sure the brass is in good shape (literally), and it hasn't been reloaded too many times.;
,


Most rifle casings work just fine together.
Common pistol calibers are a bit more picky as casings will wedge themselves in the openings of other larger caliber casings. .45s and 9mm work just fine with each other, but adding .40s into the mix will create problems. When cleaning .45s, .44 Magnums, .40s, 9mm, .357 Magnums, and 38 Specials all at the same time, clean the .45s, .44 Magnums, and 9mm in one batch, and the .40s, .357 Magnums, and 38 Specials in a separate one.
You can test to see if casings work well together by trying to fit one casing into another, if it is even remotely tight it won't work.

, The easiest way is to use a vibratory case cleaner. The case cleaner uses a media to clean the case, and optionally you can use a polishing additive to make the casings look almost as good as new!


The media is usually ground corn cob or walnut hull, but liquid media is also available. The media is what makes the tight fitting cases stick in each other. When the media is not able to cycle (because it is jammed in a casing) it cannot clean as well.
Note that the media is reusable, and less polish is needed every time you use the same media. Depending on how dirty the brass is, one batch of media may last anywhere between three and eight cleanings.

, This allows for easy access when loading so you don't have to pick up handfuls of random casings to find the one you want. It will speed up the process in the long run. Usually you place each different caliber into separate bags for transporting or storage.

Think about all possible options if you find yourself in the wild without help.,
Build a shelter with branches (bamboo works best) and rope.,
Stay out of sunlight in hot environments.,
Consider a lean-to.,
Build a bog-bed.,
Use the lenses of a magnifying glass or even your glasses to start a fire.,
Keep your body temperature as normal as possible.,
Carve a knife or spear for hunting.,
Set a trap if you can't go out to hunt.,
Find water in the first days.,
Create a smoke signal.,
Make noise to attract attention.",How to Survive in the Wild," Be decisive about what the best survival course of action is. For example, if you think the best survival course of action is to seek out help and civilization, don't wait for four or five days before you come to this conclusion. Take action on the first or second day if possible, while you still have strength and endurance working for you.

, Form an angular shape with it. Use as many branches as possible for added stability and protection against the wind and weather.;
, If you are in a desert environment, try to build an underground shade shelter to avoid prolonged sun exposure (obviously only for hot climates) so you can travel more comfortably in cooler temperatures (avoid sweating).

, For this, you need something solid like a log or large rock. Lay long-ish branches against it thickly, and criss-cross smaller branches and shrubbery on top to provide sufficient insulation. The smaller your shelter is, the better it will insulate you. Shelters in low, dense shrubbery are often home to many insects.

, If your environment is perpetually damp or mushy, use branches laid and crisscrossed on top of one another to create a solid and dry foundation for a lean-to or open bed pad. Rise above ground level as much as possible.

, Use dry wood and sticks to start your fire. Fire is started using three kinds of wood: tinder, kindling, and fuel. Tinder is any kind of flammable wood shaving; usually light and wispy. Kindling is used for coaxing the flame into a larger form, and fuel is for fuel.


You can take two pieces of dry wood, sharpen one of them and use it to drill into the other piece. Place any highly flammable objects you can find next to the drill bit. The moment the flammable object catches a spark, use a rock to swiftly tip the shouldering object onto a nest of leaves/ twigs/dry bark.







, Hypothermia or overheating can be deadly. If you are in the wilderness you should cover your body with everything from leaves to blankets before nights because the temperature often reduces drastically. Many people die each year as the result of hypothermia.

, Get an ordinary block of wood and hit with a blunt rock repeatedly until the wood sharpens. Sharpen like any other knife, but in this case, use the rock as your sharpener. You could also take a rock and break off some of the edges and then use another rock and some water like a wet stone and sharpen. In an ideal situation, Obsidian stone (black, translucent lava rock) would be used for its infamous sharpness.

, Arrange a few sticks in somewhat half a teepee. Use 2 more sticks to hold up the ""teepee"", similar to your shelter. Place an item of your choice you think an animal will come after. If you're lucky, the animal will be trapped.


Use pitfall traps for larger prey. Dig a hole in the ground about 2-3m deep and 1-2m across (depends on the prey size). Take 2 thin branches and place them crisscrossed across the hole. Cover it with leaves and put something the animals like to eat (raw meat, or peanut butter, or berries). You can also put a few wooden spikes sharpened by your knife at the bottom. Don't forget to build a ladder or you might not be able to climb out of the hole. Always remember to cut it up into smaller pieces before moving it out of the hole. The last thing you want to do is to injure yourself. Set as many traps as you can.






Go after fish first if you go hunting. When you spot one, don't make a sudden move. The vibrations will scare them off. Water bends light and makes objects appear further than they appear, so compensate for this and aim just in front of your target. Practice makes perfect.






Streams are full of food for if you cannot catch fish there are usually freshwater mussels






If you fail at catching fish, try to find some plants to eat; dandelions(yellow flowers or big white thing, eat the leaves), sour grass(has a yellow flower at the top and looks like grass, only in a cylinder shape, has no leaves, eat the cylinder type grass part), just never eat white berries. It may be tempting to eat regular grass but do not.







, Signs accompanying dehydration are dry tongue, burning throat, and dark-brown urine, at first instances. Water can set the line between life and death. Remember you can only survive for a maximum of 3 days without water.


Find a place, like a pond or similar body of water, and dig a hole right beside it, deep enough for water to fall through. Use that, because if you take it right out of the pond, you don't know what bugs will go into your mouth.
Another easy way to collect water is to set up some plastic wrap and collect dew in the morning, for water.

, Repeat the fire step, this time using live branches.

, If you hear a bunch of people near you, blow your whistle and call for help. That will get their attention and you'll likely be rescued."

Stay away from open fields or hilltops.,
Avoid swimming or watersports on rainy days.,
Don't stand near trees or tall isolated objects.,
Avoid metal objects, like fences or exposed pipes.",How to Avoid Getting Hit by Lightning1," Lightning often strikes the tallest object in the area, so avoid open fields or any hilltops. Look for a low-lying area like a valley or ravine, preferably obscured from the rain. Take refuge here until the storm passes. Crouch down with your heels touching and your head between your knees: this will make you a smaller target.Do not lie down flat, and minimize your contact with the ground. Lightning can be fatal up to one hundred feet away from the initial strike.;
, Check weather forecasts early in the day, and avoid going to a swimming pool, river, lake, or beach on rainy days. If you find yourself in open water during a thunderstorm, return to land immediately. If you are in a boat and cannot return to safety, drop anchor and crouch as low as possible.Do not return to the body of water until thirty minutes after the last lightning strike. Any earlier, and the storm may not be over.Indoor swimming is equally unsafe. Avoid all large bodies of water during a storm., Taller objects are more likely to be struck by lightning. Wherever you are, don't become the highest object anywhere. Avoid standing under trees in a lightning storm, and stay away from tall objects like light posts.If you're in a forest, stay near a lower stand of trees.Umbrellas can increase your risk of getting hit if it is the tallest object in the area., Metal conducts electricity, and you are much more likely to get hit. If you are carrying large metal objects, let them go. Small metal objects, like piercings or electronic devices, do not carry a large risk and are safe to hold.

If you are riding a bicycle, drop the bike and crouch to the ground. Most bikes are made of metal and are excellent lightning conductors.Rubber shoes or other rubber objects will not actually protect you from metal's conducting properties."

Collect your supplies.,
Set the dies on the press according to the press' manual and the instructions that come with the dies.,
Add your selection of powder to the powder measure.,
Calibrate the amount of powder going into the casing by placing an empty casing below the powder measure and pulling the press' handle.,
Add primers to the primer hopper.,
Lubricate the exterior of the casings.",How to Hand Load Ammunition2," You will need casings, primers, bullets and powder to make a working cartridge.


Dirty casings will need cleaning before use. A vibratory cleaner with corn or walnut media works great. Adding a casing polish will make your brass look almost as good as new!

, Each set of dies will have a somewhat unique way to set them correctly.


Calibrate them to specifications of a respected loading handbook. Crimp diameters and bullet seat depths are very important for your safety (more on this later).
If available for the specific caliber you are loading, purchase carbide dies. This is an especially dense type of metal which removes the need for lubricating the casings.

,


Powder is very specific. Having the incorrect type of powder or an incorrect amount of powder can have very bad results. It is recommended you buy a respected loading handbook with the calibers you intend to load and follow their suggested powders and amounts.

, Check the amount of powder deposited in a separate scale. Most loading handbooks have a minimum, maximum, and recommended starting. When calibrating the powder measure toward the minimum or maximum, always err toward the recommended.

, This usually involves some type of primer pickup device (often a long tube with plastic on either end and a pin). Be sure the primers are oriented correctly in the hopper.


There are a few different types of primers, be sure you have the right kind: small and large pistol primers, small and large pistol magnum primers, small and large rifle primers, and small and large magnum rifle primers. The simplest way to get the right primer is to consult a loading handbook, they will have the size and type of primer, and may even have they exact primer brand/model number that they used for testing.

, If you are reloading necked-down cartridges, lubricate the interior of the neck as well.


Be sure to use a lubrication specifically designed for ammunition casings.
This step can be skipped if you have carbide dies (carbide is much more available for pistol calibers than rifle calibers).

",How to Hand Load Ammunition3," Often there is a spring that holds the casing in place. Be sure the casing is perfectly upright and centered. If the casing is partially crushed, it may not work, but if it makes it past the first station, it should be fine.


Be sure that the casing has solid integrity, and the mouth of the casing (the opening) does not have any folds which will create operation or safety problems when fired.

,


This first station resizes the brass (shot casings expand slightly, so this station shrinks it slightly) and extracts the old used primer. (Note: be sure you never extract a live primer, this is one of the most dangerous things you can do with a loading press!)


, To load a fresh primer from your primer hopper press the handle forward until it stops (this won't be very far, but again, some pressure will be needed).

, From now on you will repeat steps 1 - 3 (a four-station press does up to four things every time you pull —or push— the handle) to keep the tray as full as possible (until supplies or time run out).


The second station adds powder from the powder measure (powder drop) into the casing. The amount of powder should be checked for the first two casings, the last casing, and every 50 - 100 casings. The powder measure should be adjusted if the amount of powder moves out of your predetermined tolerance range.

,


The third station bells the casing. This allows you to easily place a bullet on top of the casing, but a bell that is any larger than needed will reduce the casings integrity, too little belling will make seating the bullet difficult.

, In the fourth station, a bullet will be seated and the casing crimped.

, This station will also crimp the casing around the bullet. Other than the amount of powder, bullet seating depth and crimping is arguably the most important part of the loading process.


A bullet which is seated too deep or a crimp which is too tight can create unsafe pressures in the chamber when fired.
A bullet which is seated too shallow may cause the bullet to engage in the rifling when chambered, before it should be. This can cause inaccuracies if fired, but it can also cause a Type-4 malfunction or problems ejecting the live cartridge.
A casing which is inadequately crimped may cause the bullet to be loose in the casing, and it may potentially fall out. It can also cause the cartridge not to load into the chamber of the firearm smoothly.
See tips for more information.

Add a lightning rod to your roof.,
Avoid bathing, showering, or using the sink as much as possible.,
Turn off and stay away from wired electronics.,
Keep your windows closed.",How to Avoid Getting Hit by Lightning2," Lightning rods do not attract lightning but do provide a path of least resistance if lightning hits your house. This can prevent the electric current from damaging your home. Do not install a lightning rod yourself: find an electrician certified to install lightning systems., During thunderstorms, lightning can travel through water pipes if it strikes your home. Do not bathe or shower until the storm has passed. If you have to use the sink, only do so in emergencies.Even showers or bathtubs that are completely enclosed without windows nearby put you at-risk for electrocution because of the water pipes.
Avoid areas with standing water or excessive moisture during storms, like a cellar basement or patio slab.Because porcelain is a great insulator, toilets are safe to use during lightning storms so long as you aren't touching metal., Using electronic devices that plug into the wall is dangerous during a lightning storm. Avoid using TVs, washing machines, and corded phones during thunderstorms. Wireless electronics, like cell phones, are safe to use unless they are plugged into a charger.Unplug electronic objects during a thunderstorm in case lightning strikes the house and the surge short circuits them., Avoid standing next to open windows or doors during a thunderstorm. Although rare, lightning can travel through windows during storms. Glass is a good insulator, so it is unlikely that the window will be struck if closed.

Do not touch doorknobs during a storm, as metal conducts electricity."

Run to your vehicle for safety.,
Place your hands in your lap.,

Pull to the side of the road in heavy storms.",How to Avoid Getting Hit by Lightning3," When your choice is either outdoors or inside a car, your car is always the safest option. If caught in a thunderstorm, remain inside your car until the storm passes. Close your windows, and put the top up in your convertible.

Open vehicles, like golf carts, ATVs, and riding mowers, are not safe during lightning storms. Seek shelter indoors.
Convertibles are less safe than other cars in thunderstorms. If possible, avoid driving them when it's raining.
Starting your car is generally safe during a thunderstorm, but do not under any circumstances jump your car until the storm has passed.

, Most cars are safe from lightning, but the metal exterior or any metal objects are not safe to touch. If lightning strikes your car, the current will flow from the car's outer metal cage and into the ground below. Keep your hands in your lap and avoid leaning on the car doors or touching any exposed metal.

Rubber tires will not protect your car from getting struck., Some portions of the current can travel through the wired areas in your car. Don't touch any of the vehicle's electrical systems during the car, including your radio, GPS system, or cell phone charger.

In some cases, lightning strikes can damage your car's electric systems. Avoid driving your car during thunderstorms if you have expensive radio or GPS systems installed.

, If driving in an outage area, pull over and turn on your hazard lights. Areas with outages are dangerous to drive in, especially if the traffic lights have shorted out. If you must continue traveling, treat intersections with shorted traffic signals as a four-way stop and take extra caution."

Look ahead and start braking early.,
Stay in control of steering by using one finger to brake.,
Pulse on your brakes.",How to Brake in the Dirt and in Wet Conditions when Mountain Biking," When the trail is wet, you aren't going to be able to stop as fast as on a dry surface, so allow for more time to stop. Looking ahead allows you to apply the brakes more gradually.;
, If you use your index finger to brake, you can keep your other fingers on your handle bars to steer. Also, by using one finger rather than your entire hand, you are less likely to slam on the brakes and lock up.

, In your car you probably have anti-lock brakes. What anti lock brakes do is they slow down the wheel by pulsing on it so that the bottom of the wheel is at rest, and therefore has a larger static friction coefficient rather than a smaller kinetic friction coefficient. What this means for all you non-physics minded people out there is that anti lock brakes prevent the wheels from skidding. You can do this on your bike by fluctuating your braking pressure to keep your wheels rolling and staying in control of your bike.

Choose layers.,
Cover your head.,
Protect your upper body.,
Protect your lower body.,
Cover your hands and feet.,
Be prepared for extreme temperatures.",How to Survive a Chicago Winter," Layers always beat insulation. You may have a $400 down parka that made you sweat on the coldest day in New York, but it will be almost useless when confronted with the sustained winds that are common in Chicago. The cold air will immediately chill the t-shirt you have under it, and subsequently turn your wardrobe into a beer cooler. When the mean temperature (not the windchill) drops below 20ºF, there should be no time when you're wearing less than two layers. This includes gloves and even socks if you haven't invested in real snow boots or thermal boots for high altitude climbing.;
, Don't bother with hats and scarves unless you already own a warm aviator hat that buckles around your chin. Instead, buy a decent balaclava that covers your neck and shoulders and that can be adjusted to cover your entire lower face or stay rested under your chin. Your second layer will be the hood of your jacket.

, You don't need to invest in a $700 arctic jacket. In fact, many of the down parkas available will make you sweat and will fail to protect you from wind gusts; being covered in sweat can be worse than wearing nothing at all. Instead, aim for a medium insulated parka that is rated between -10ºF and 0ºF. A nylon exterior is a plus, as it will repel any snow or freezing rain from dampening the insulation. A good example is the Knox Armory N-3B Parka, which can be found for under $100. Under the parka you'll want to wear a thin but heavy sweatshirt. The tops of winter track suits work perfectly for this, and also give you the benefit of a zipper so you dress or undress both layers in one suave motion. Under the sweatshirt is not your bare skin of course, but what you plan on wearing indoors. This provides three layers that will ensure your body won't even be fazed by the merciless cold outside. Be sure to tuck the inner layer inside your pants so that wind doesn't blow cold air up your back.

, Most people get lazy about this, but jeans simply do not cut it. On a normal winter day, throw on some thin thermal underwear that reaches your ankles under your pants. It makes a world of difference. When temperatures drop below zero, you'll either want some thicker thermals or to invest in some snow pants to wear over your indoor pants. Do not wear sweatpants or dress pants as your outer layer. If you have a long commute to work, you'll be much happier putting 30 seconds aside to change into them when you arrive.

, Thin fabric gloves seem useless in Chicago, but they're not. They make a perfect secondary layer to wear under thicker, waterproof gloves. If it isn't snowing and you're wearing a normal pair of shoes, double up on socks. When putting them on, pull them above the ankles of your thermal underwear so your skin isn't exposed while walking. If there is more than two inches of snow, forget about your shoes. Not only will you ruin them, but you'll be putting yourself at risk of frostbite as it tends to clench around your ankles and ice up. You'll want to invest in a pair of waterproof winter boots that go at least halfway to your knees. This is tricky because there are a lot of winter boots for sale at department stores that are little more than moisture sponges attached to your feet. Instead, try looking in sports and outdoors stores for boots with certified temperature ratings and waterproof materials. Kamik is a company that makes great winter boots that cost about as much as your average inept department store boot.

, When the windchill drops below -10ºF, you run a very serious risk of frostbite and nerve damage on your hands, feet, and face, sometimes in as little as a few minutes outdoors. Luckily this only happens a few times per season, but you need to be on top of the weather forecast alerts so you can dress appropriately. You'll want to add another layer to your upper body, adjust your balaclava to cover everything but your eyes, and wear your jacket's hood fully extended forward, creating a small tunnel between your face and the outside air. Your breath will keep the exposed skin from freezing. Of course, this isn't very comfortable either, but it will keep you warm and most importantly, alive.

Wear shoes or boots with traction.,
Get shoes or boots with ankle support.,
Add additional grip to your shoes.,
Knock the snow off your footwear.",How to Avoid Slipping in Snow1," Nothing is worse than wearing footwear without grip while walking in the snow. It will send you sliding in no time. Instead, pick sneakers or boots that have lots of traction. If the soles have treads with deep grooves then they are less likely to slip when you take a step.


Avoid wearing unstable shoes or any sort of shoe with no tread while walking in the snow. Wearing sensible shoes in the snow will help you tremendously.
Of course, shoes designed to be worn in snow are probably the best choice. They should have great traction for snow, as well as usually being waterproof.;
, Having ankle support can help you avoid a slip. Supporting your ankles allows you to have more stability when your feet start to go, especially if you have weak ankles to begin with. Ankle support may also help you to avoid an ankle injury if you do indeed fall.


Without ankle support you are more likely to get an ankle strain if you fall, especially if you have injured your ankles before.You may try to use your ankles to steady yourself if you begin to slip and this can injure an unsteady ankle.

, If you will be doing a lot of walking in the snow, and you are less than thrilled with the amount of grip your shoes are giving, then add some traction to them. You can buy removable ice grips that you can add to any shoe or boot. They can usually be put on and taken off easily and will increase your stability immensely.If you are in a pinch, place a plastic bag or sock over your footwear. This will increase the grip significantly.

, Whatever kind of shoes you pick, be sure to knock the snow off of them when you get a chance. This will clear the grooves on the sole and allow them to create traction again. Use any opportunity you can to stamp the snow off your footwear.


Knocking the snow off your shoes will it prevent the ice from melting into your footwear, and it will give you that extra comfort when walking.

Take your time.,
Keep your weight leaning slightly forward on the insides of your feet.,
Walk on the grit!,
Avoid walking on highly compacted snow.,
Concentrate on walking.",How to Avoid Slipping in Snow2," It's important not to rush when you are walking in the snow. Even if you are late or trying to get somewhere quickly, be calm and step slowly. If you do try to rush your steps, you might be arriving late anyhow because you got an injury.


Walk with short and cautious steps to avoid slipping.

, This means that you will be walking a little bit like a penguin. This position will be more stable when attempting to move across a slippery surface.


If you do fall while walking in this position, you are more likely to fall forward rather than backward.

, If you have the option of walking on a more stable surface than you should. Sidewalks covered in sand or litter will help you walk more easily and you may even be able to pick up your pace.


Remember that a sidewalk with grit on it is not slip proof! While you may be able to walk a bit quicker, don't abandon caution altogether. You may just hit a slippery spot and have your feet slid right out from underneath you.

, Walk near the edges of the sidewalk where few have walked already. Compacted snow can quickly turn into ice, which is much more slippery. Instead, walk in the snow that is still fluffy and less slippery.


You may get snow all over your shoes when walking in the deeper snow but that is better than slipping and falling.

, Pay attention to where you are going and don't get sidetracked from focusing on your steps. Try to think a few steps ahead and plan your next movements before you do them. This will help you to pick the best route and avoid particularly slippery areas.


Be sure not to bump into other people around you because you are concentrating on your steps so much. You need to be aware of your surroundings, in addition to being cautious with your steps.

Shovel your walk.,
Lay down grit.,
Put out ice melt.",How to Avoid Slipping in Snow3," The best way to avoid slipping in snow is to avoid walking in it in the first place. Thus, if you don't want to slip in the snow in from of your home, then spend the time to remove it. Shoveling snow can be a hard job that takes a lot of energy but it is worth the work if you can avoid falling, or having someone else fall, in front of your home.


Be sure to prepare well for snow shoveling before you do it. Get a good snow shovel that will help you move snow effectively and get a good stretch in before exerting yourself. Stretching before shoveling snow will help you avoid injury from the hard work., Sometimes after shoveling there is still a frozen layer that can be very slippery. This is especially the case if the remaining snow melts a little and then refreezes into a sheet of ice. In order to avoid slipping on this ice, put down a layer of grit after you shovel. This will assure that when you walk in the area you don't slip.


The grit you lay down can vary. Some people use a small gravel or sand, while others use kitty litter to give the walk traction., If you want your walk to be completely free of ice and snow you can put an ice melting product on it. You can either use salt or a manufacturer ice-melting product. These products are made of chemicals that lower the freezing point of water, in essence melting all snow it comes into contact with.


Ice melting products can usually be found at your local home improvement store.
Be sure to look for any warnings on the packaging of an ice melt product you are considering using. There may be warnings about what surfaces they can be applied to and what to avoid getting the product on.
In addition to melting ice, salt can severely damage, or kill, plants and wildlife. Be sure to use it sparingly if you are concerned about the health of plants and animals near your walk. In fact, some cities have outlawed the use of salt in order to protect wildlife."

Crocodilians live in tropical regions of Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia, and depending on the species, can live in both fresh and salt water.If you live in or visit a tropical region, ask local residents and authorities about the presence of crocodiles, alligators, or caiman before approaching any bodies of water.


Take warning signs about the presence of crocodiles seriously.
Never go swimming outside of designated areas in regions where crocodilians are known to live. If a potential swimming area is unmarked, do not assume that it is safe.
Interestingly, almost 95% of recent crocodile attacks in northern Australia have involved locals. Don't let your familiarity with crocodilians lead you into a false sense of security around them.;
, Over 90% of crocodile attacks occur in or near the water and you must use extreme care to avoid them. Crocodilians usually live in and around slow-moving water with a lot of mud and vegetation, and can most often be found in swamps and marshes. They can also inhabit lakes, ponds, rivers, estuaries, man-made canals and the occasional swimming pool.Saltwater crocodiles can also be found on ocean beaches, and even traversing the open sea!Swimming in water where crocodilians live is an obvious danger, but crocs also attack people who are fishing, gathering water, or wading at the water's edge.
Crocodiles, in particular, are also known to attack and overturn boats, and will even grab people off of boats and drag them into the water., Crocodilians can attack at any time, but are most active and most dangerous at dusk and at night.Try to be well away from the water before nightfall, but still remember to stay alert during the day.


If you are on or near infested water after dark, use a flashlight or headlamp to check the area frequently for eye-shine.

, Alligators and crocodiles are at their most dangerous during mating and breeding season when they are more aggressive. These animals are also more frequently encountered on land during this period, as they sometimes wander in search of a mate or suitable nesting site. Nesting mothers are especially ferocious, and will defend their nests viciously.


The breeding season for crocodilians differs by species and location. If you live in an area where they live, familiarize yourself with the habits of the native population, and be especially on guard during breeding season.
Breeding season for freshwater crocodiles in Australia typically begins in July and August, with nesting season extending from September to April.Florida's alligator population usually breeds beginning in May, with breeding and nesting season lasting for several months.During breeding season, remember to use caution both on and around infested waters, and when walking through grass or vegetation near the water.

, If you must be on or near water where crocodilians live, remain vigilant at all times. Remember that crocodilians are experts at hiding, and even a giant croc might show nothing more than its nostrils above the surface of the water. Be especially wary around muddy or murky water, and where vegetation is present. It's safest to assume that even if you can't see the crocodilians, they are still there.


Keep your distance from the water when walking on the shore, and avoid patches of vegetation where these animals could hide.
An alligator that feels threatened may hiss at you. If you hear a hissing alligator, try to determine where the sound is coming from, and then leave in the opposite direction as quietly and quickly as you can.

, Crocodilians are attracted to the sound and movement of small animals, and American alligators are reportedly quite fond of eating dogs. If you do walk your dog near the water, keep it on a leash and be on guard for any movement on or near the water., Crocodilians prefer smaller prey and unfortunately, attacks on children are quite common., Feeding these animals teaches them to lose their natural wariness around people and to associate people with food. Never feed them intentionally, and be careful not to feed them accidentally by throwing fish scrap and other edible refuse into the water.Only feeding young animals is not OK. Remember that a 2-foot long alligator will eventually grow up to be a 10-foot long alligator that might still expect humans to feed it. This is dangerous for both the animal and any humans it might meet.

, You should pitch your tent at least 2 meters (6 feet) above the high water mark, and at least 50 meters (164 feet) from the water's edge. Check the area to make sure that previous campers have not left out food and garbage that may attract crocodilians to your location, and clean up any that you find. Store food securely, and dispose of all food scraps and garbage in secure cans away from your campsite., If you do spot a crocodilian, keep as far from it as possible. Australian wildlife officials state that the minimum safe distance from crocodiles on the water is at least 25 meters (about 82 feet), and that boats should stay at least 10 meters (33 feet) away. Large crocodilians can launch themselves through the water at speeds of up to 60 kmh (37 mph), faster than most people can react.


Crocodilians can also launch themselves vertically from the water. Don't stand on docks or low bridges over water, or lean over the side of boats or hang from trees over infested waters.

, If you spot baby crocodilians or a nest, leave the area as quickly and quietly as you can. Mother crocodilians will defend their young fearlessly and must not be provoked.


Occasionally crocodilians wander into populated areas, especially when people live very close to the water. If you encounter a crocodilian in your backyard, pool, etc. first get to safety and then call the local authorities.

, Splashing around and shouting attracts attention from crocodilians and may incite them to attack. Swim or wade to the shore as quickly, quietly and calmly as you can, preferably staying below the water's surface to avoid splashing., Do not try to approach the animal, attack it, or try to move it. If you spot one of these animals in a populated area, such as a backyard or parking lot, first get to a safe distance from the animal and then call local wildlife authorities to have it removed., Should you accidentally happen upon an alligator or crocodile, or if one begins to move towards you, run away from the animal as quickly as you can. As fast as they are in the water, the top land speed for a crocodilian is only 17kmh (10 mph), a speed that most humans can surpass over short distances.Be sure to run away from the water to avoid running into the jaws of more crocodilians.
Forget the conventional wisdom about running in a zig-zag pattern to escape; the quickest way to escape an alligator or crocodile is in a straight line.

, While the very notion of remaining calm during an animal attack may seem preposterous, doing so may be the only thing that saves your life.If the crocodilian merely bites you at first and lets go, this is probably a defensive attack. Don't wait or try to attack it, just run away as quickly as you can.
If the animal seizes hold of you, however, it will likely try to drag you into the water. In this case, you will need to attack it until it lets go.

, The eyes of the crocodilian are its most vulnerable part, and several croc-attack survivors have reported eye-gouging as their salvation. Attempt to gouge, kick, or poke the animal in the eye with your hands or whatever you can grab. Don't give up until you are free, you are literally fighting for your life., If you land as many blows as possible on the animal's head, you stand a higher chance that it will let go. Bystanders observing a crocodilian attack can assist by striking at the animal with sticks, poles, oars, etc., and by kicking and even punching the animal, especially in the head., Crocodilians have a flap of tissue behind the tongue that covers their throats when they submerge in water. This flap prevents water from flowing into their throats and prevents the crocodile from drowning when its mouth is open. If the animal has dragged you under the water, grabbing hold of this valve may be your only choice. Once you get hold of the valve, it will cause water to flow into the crocodile's throat, forcing it to release you.


Hard strikes to this valve may also cause the animal to release you.

, Not only do crocodilian attacks tend to cause a lot of tissue damage and blood loss, they can also quickly lead to infection. These animals harbor a massive amount of bacteria in their mouths, and even a minor bite from a small alligator or caiman can quickly lead to infection if not treated right away."

Lay on the ground.",How to Survive an Encounter with an Ostrich1," Expect ostriches to attain speeds of 43 mph (70 km) over open ground.If there is dense vegetation or woods close enough for you to reach before the ostrich reaches you, sprint for that.Prevent the ostrich from attaining optimum speed so it has less chance of outrunning you.


If there is more sturdy cover than vegetation (such as a car or manmade structure), go for that. A kick from an ostrich’s leg can hit you with an impact of 500 psi, which is enough to kill a human.If you don’t think you can make it, DO NOT attempt it. Ostriches are extremely fast and will attack by kicking you in the back as soon as they catch up to you.;
, Rest assured that, while ostriches do eat meat, they stick to insects, small reptiles, and rodents.Understand that a provoked ostrich will chase humans primarily because it feels threatened, not because it wants to eat them.At your first opportunity, duck behind cover that conceals you from its view, rather than risk a prolonged chase.Expect the ostrich to lose interest once it thinks that you are gone.

, Remember that an ostrich is incapable of flight.If no hiding places are to be found on ground-level, climb a tree, fence, or other structure.Wait for the ostrich to lose interest and leave before coming back down.


An adult ostrich typically stands 7 to 9 feet tall (2 to 3 meters). Although it has no teeth, it may jab at you with its beak and potentially upset your balance. Seek a higher elevation to keep out of range.

, Opt for getting pricked by thorns instead being disemboweled by the ostrich’s razor-sharp talons. If no other hiding spots are available, jump straight into a thorn bush. Wait for the ostrich to leave before climbing out.Expect the ostrich to refrain from poking its head in after you, in order to protect its large eyes.

, Resist the urge to run for cover or elevation if it is too far away. Instead, play dead as a last-ditch effort. Lay with your stomach to the ground. Cover the back of your head with your arms to protect your skull. Brace yourself for the ostrich to toy with you. Wait for it to tire of this and leave before getting back up. Be aware that this method may still result in injury.The risk of injury from the force of impact of an ostrich’s kick is dramatically reduced when you lay down. The ostrich kicks forward, then downward, with most of its force being been spent in the forward motion.
The talons still do pose a danger. Lie on your stomach to better protect your organs, since the ostrich may rake you with its talons.
The ostrich may stand or even sit on you before it tires. An adult ostrich may weigh between 198 and 350 lbs (90 and 159 kilograms)."

Think it through.,

Once you have shelter and water taken care of, it's time to think about food.,
Tell someone where you're going.,
Trust your instincts.",How to Run Away from Home and Live in the Woods," Running away from home should be a last-ditch resort, and never a first choice. Similarly, trying to live in the woods on your own should never be your first choice. Make sure you have no other options (like calling the police if you live in an abusive situation or going to a homeless shelter instead of the wilderness) before you try to run away and live in the woods. Living in the woods is dangerous, draining, and scary. You will likely go hungry and thirsty at times, go without sleep at times, and may even die, or develop a constant sense of paranoia. Only run away into the woods if you have no other options.;
, You need to think through how and when you'll run away from home, what you'll bring with you, and how you'll get to your destination without being stopped by authorities. Plan an escape route. Especially if you live a few floors up from the ground or in a heavily populated area, you'll need a detailed but flexible plan for getting to the place you intend to stay.

, Get a bag or backpack for your items; make sure to take something that is easy for you to carry and can hold everything you'll need. You will need a few bottles of water--a human typically needs at least gallon of water for drinking, cooking, and washing each day, so bring a lot. Then, pack a knife for cutting rope or food, matches or other firestarters, water purification tablets, canned and nonperishable food including Meals Ready to Eat (MREs), rope, wire, fishing hooks, extra clothing, a good wilderness survival book (such as the U.S. Army Survival Handbook or the SAS Survival Guide, which is available in a convenient pocket size), supplies for personal hygiene (such as soap, shampoo, and toothpaste), a few flame-safe pots or dishes for cooking, good walking shoes and extra socks, heat packs, a basic first aid kit (with bandages, antiseptic, basic pain relievers and allergy medication, and a first aid guidebook at the very least), a poncho for when it rains, and a map and compass, at the bare minimum. If you want, you can take your cell phone (just keep in mind that it can be tracked unless you specifically disable it). Remember that the battery will run down quickly and you won't be able to recharge it without returning to civilization or bringing along a solar phone charger. If you bring your phone, you can call for help once you are away from the family members that made you run away.

, Once you have decided to run away, your top priority is shelter. The most important part of shelter isn't a roof over your head, though--it's something to put between you and the ground when you sleep. A sleeping bag is ideal, but if you don't have the chance to take one with you, use whatever you can--piles of leaves, old newspapers, or a layer of spare clothes spread on the ground--to keep your body as removed from the ground as possible while you sleep. The last thing you need is for the ground to leech your body heat in the middle of the night. Do whatever it takes to ensure you don't sleep on bare ground. Once you have something between you and the ground, go about finding something for shelter from the rain and sun. If you can carry or find a plastic tarp, you can stretch it between two trees and weigh the sides down with rocks. You can also use other materials in your new camp site and make it stronger. Roots can be used as rope and leaves can add to waterproofing. If you're in a cold climate, use piles of leaves against the walls of your shelter or heaped over yourself as insulation. You may want to check out this article on making a survival shelter: https://www.wikihow.com/Build-a-Survival-Shelter.


If you are surrounded by snow in the winter, build an igloo type of shelter. You can dig down into the snow and build up the walls around you. Make certain to leave holes for ventilation that won't be blocked by any falling snow, so you won't suffocate. You really don't need to be on your own when it is snowing, and a homeless or youth shelter or 24-hour public place is always a better choice, but in an emergency this can be a good shelter.

, When you're camping out, it can get bitterly cold outside. Always make sure to practice good fire safety, like making sure to keep the fire away from anything flammable and keep smoke out of your shelter.

, The most important thing after shelter is water. A human will die without water for three days, so set about finding a reliable way of obtaining some as soon as possible. NEVER drink water that has not been purified. There are several ways of purifying your water--you can boil and filter it, use a solar-powered distiller, or use storebought water purification methods like a portable water filter or purification tablets. Always follow instructions for storebought purifiers closely, and if you doubt the safety of the water, don't drink it. Never drink water from sources with a number of dead animals or skeletons around it--the water may be poisonous. Never drink cloudy water without filtering out particulates, but never assume that clear water is safe to drink, either. Don't ration your water supply while searching for a new one--your body can't ration water, and hikers have been known to die with drinkable water left in their canteens. Better that you stay fully hydrated and functional for as long as you can, and are able to return to society if you can't find a water source.

, A lot of plants and animals can make you sick or even kill you if you eat them, so be sure that whatever you put in your mouth is safe. The most basic rules to remember are to avoid mushrooms and avoid anything that's already dead when you find it (unless it's dead because it's been caught in your trap). Always test foods using the Universal Edibility Test (https://www.wikihow.com/Test-if-a-Plant-Is-Edible) prior to consuming them unless you are 110% certain that you know what plant you're eating and that it's safe. Always properly clean and cook animals you trap prior to eating them. Don't discount bugs as a source of food and nutrition, but do make sure to prepare them properly.

, If you do decide to give the woods a try, always tell a trusted friend or family member who won't tell the people you're running away from about the area you will go. You don't have to give exact coordinates but the general area is good in case you are hurt or bad weather is likely to endanger you.

, One way to avoid a potential attack or disaster before it happens is to trust your instincts. Your intuition, combined with your common sense, can help get you out of trouble. For example, if you're running alone and you suddenly feel like you're being watched, or pick up some berries and get a bad feeling in your stomach, that could be your intuition telling you something. Your common sense would then tell you that it's a good idea to get back to where there are more people around, or drop the berries. If you feel like you are being followed, tell someone that will be able to help. Officers and teachers are best but if you are not near school, a store clerk can be just as helpful.

Stay tuned.,
Get prepared!,
Before we get started in the rest of the planning, it's important to know what a tornado watch, tornado warning, severe thunderstorm watch and a severe thunderstorm warning means.,
Is everyone home?,
Make sure everything is working.,
Do not go outside.,
Stay calm.,
Make sure the storm in your area is over, But exercise caution!,
Access the local resources for help.,
Rebuild with the future in mind.,
Look into counseling if you were traumatized by the storm.,
If you made that mistake of leaving without checking the forecast and find yourself in the midst of a forming tornado, don't rush to an overpass.,
If you get caught in a heavy rainstorm, pay undivided attention to the road and turn on your emergency blinkers.,
Learn the sound of the sirens of the nearby towns you're traveling in/by, it could save your life!,
Depending on the circumstances of your situation, you may want to head back unless the same threat is at your home.,
Keep in mind that not all severe weather counts as tornadoes and hail.,
Understand that winter weather outbreaks usually consist of blizzards and avalanches.,
Keep in mind that a drought, or a long period of dryness, is still equally dangerous.,
Learn how to escape from a sinking car.,
Know how to survive a wildfire.",How to Survive a Severe Weather Outbreak," It is important to learn the threats of the system or systems passing by.


Look for the threat area. If your family is at risk, call them in advance to let them know about the storm.
Know the threats; for example, they may be tornadoes, flooding and hail. Make the proper adjustments beforehand. If there is the possibility of flooding, move everything you can to higher ground. Also take note of all the threats as well, High risk of tornadoes and a moderate risk of hail? Highlighted.
How severe are the threats going to be? There is usually marginal, slight, moderate, and severe. But this varies in different countries, if there is any threat, things could change rapidly. Still plan if it is a marginal threat.
Is it a nocturnal threat? They're often the most dangerous since they cannot be seen. Don't even think about trying to find it! Many people have died trying to see a tornado in the nighttime.
What does the weather center or news channel say? (Example: ""Tornado risk is highest in X."") Even if the projected location is 10 miles (16.1 km) north or south of you, assume it's in your area, for your safety.
If there was an event planned for the day, may need to postpone it. Only go out when it is an absolute emergency.;
, Your safety plan will depend on the exact kind of weather approaching.What will you need in your situation? In tornado outbreaks, you may want battery powered flashlights and a plenty of food and water sources. However, you will definitely need other items as well.
How much do you need? You would want your safety plan to last for 72 hours or more, and you would want enough food and water to last you. Nonperishable foods are recommended.
Why will you need it? Battery powered flashlights for after the storm and for turning off gas (If you have any.), First aid to administer to injuries caused by the storms, and a weather radio for weather bulletins.

,


A Tornado watch means that the conditions are ripe for severe thunderstorms to produce tornadoes.
A PDS (Particularly dangerous situation) tornado watch is a special type of tornado watch. It is rarely used, it means that there is a chance for long track, potentially dangerous tornadoes.
A Severe thunderstorm watch means that the conditions are ripe for severe thunderstorms to develop. Depending on your situation, it may be upgraded to a Tornado watch. They span for 3-6 hours.
A Tornado warning means that the radar or trained storm spotters have detected a tornado in your area. Move into a windowless room immediately!
A Severe thunderstorm warning means that winds have exceeded the severe limit (58 MPH). It could also include hail and a little bit of rotation. If the rotation gets too strong, it may be upgraded to a tornado warning.

, No one in your household needs to be out in the event of severe weather, Such as flooding, tornadoes, and the like.


Has your employers and/or local schools let out early? That should be a sign to get home immediately, rather than running any other errands such as shopping.
Have you called to check in with everybody? You should have done this a bit in the first step. Make sure to have your family at home to grab the emergency supplies and the pets. By the time the storm comes, they should be able to get to the safe shelter in the matter of seconds.

, You wouldn't want your radio to be broken at the most needed time.


Be sure to grab your insurance papers and have pictures of your possessions, put it in a protected box in your safe place. Extra points if it's waterproof! (Who knows? You may need it.)
Is your safe place secure and ready to go? Make sure you pack plenty of batteries, water, and nourishing food. You should also bring toys if you have children (in order to keep them occupied) and pet food for your pets.
Put your animals in their cages and get ready to move to the safe place.

, Make sure your radio is ready to grab if your power goes out. It is highly recommended that you set your emergency items right next to the radio.


If you have a waterproof basement, sleep there for the night. Just make sure your gas is in check.
Put your things in a cooler, just don't pack loads of ice cream. Unless it is for calming your kids down in a tornado.

, Panicking will impede your judgement and cause the others around you to panic. If your kids are scared, keep them close and warm. Make sure they have their favorite stuffed animal. But if it is where the storm is, it's good as gone..


Tell them about how many new toys and clothes they'll get! Just don't make it sound bad.
If you don't see your pets in your safe shelter, don't cry or think about the worse. They're smarter than you think! Don't be surprised if they join you or come out after it's over.

, More storms may be on the way.


Can you still hear a deep rumbling sound or a sound of a freight train or a jet lifting off? That means the tornado is still there and more are coming. Don't freak out if your weather radio or siren gets crossed (Connection gets knocked out.), That should be a definite sign to not come out. Wait until the emergency personnel come knocking on your door, if you can't get the door opened. Do not freak out. They'll be able to get you out.

, If you were unfortunate and your house was destroyed or there were some injuries in your neighborhood, remember, help is coming. If you were fortunate and still have your house. Help others! Not everyone was lucky.


After a life changing storm, your town or state may become more tight-knit than ever.
Did you make sure you had your insurance box? Show it to your agent. Some things may be salvageable, there may be some possessions that are salvageable but may not be worth much in sentimental value.

, For the next storm, rebuild with preparedness in mind. Will you add a basement in ground or above ground? Will the new house have more strength then the old one?


If you're rebuilding, you should try to have at least two severe weather shelter places in the house. A windowless room, such as a closet or basement, is highly recommended.

, Don't let it haunt you for the rest of your life. In order to feel even safer, you could invest in a stress ball (or doll) and always have your severe weather outbreak shelters, supplies and papers on hand.

, Overpasses act as wind tunnels that strengthen the tornado's winds.


Get into a ditch or low lying area and cover your head. Don't waste time by bracing your iPad. Don't forget any of your children in the panic.
If you see the impending storm miles away from you on the interstate, go to a nearby town and ride it out. If you are nowhere close to a town, put on your emergency blinkers and go on the side of the road. Be sure to turn on the closest weather station and listen for warnings.
Learn which county you're in! Don't make the mistake of thinking you are in Blakely county to find out the hard way you're in Duchess county. In the U.S.A, they are posted on the right side of the road on a green sign.

, Get ready to pull on the side of the road to wait it out. Do not use your phone when driving; this is illegal.


Be completely certain that a tornado isn't out there. Be 100% sure, not 95%; the missing 5% can get you killed.
Is there a high risk of flooding? If you can, avoid traveling until the danger is over.
If you got caught in a hailstorm, immediately grab a helmet or anything that could protect your head and eyes and stabilize your child's car seat. Put the overhead on to protect the young child from the hail and glass.

, Some cities sound their sirens for severe thunderstorm warnings during a tornado watch, others don't. Be sure to know about this in advance.


Also learn the sounds of the sirens of those towns you are going in/by, A high pitched noise could be a tornado warning and a moderate pitch could be a severe thunderstorm warning.
Be aware the sirens can be crossed by the storm, so keep your own set of warning systems as well.
If the sky appears clear and the sirens go off, seek shelter. Lightning and tornadoes can come in the absence of clouds.
If you have animals in the car, bring them up front and put them in their cages. Put a sheet over the cage to protect it from the falling glass. If a tornado is very close to you, take your pets out of their cages and put them on their leashes and get into a low lying area with them. Be careful to not injure them, they'll probably be as scared as you are. If you suspect that they may have been injured, bring them to the nearest pet hospital.

,


You can stay at your relatives' or friends' house in another state until it blows over. Be sure to tell your family about the storm, and mention that you are okay as well.

, It could be blizzards or ice storms, in meteorological terms it is considered a winter weather outbreak.


For example, in a winter weather outbreak, you would want to pack emergency blankets, canned foods, and a lot of gas. You would want to tell your family where you're going in case of an emergency.
Another example is a prolonged period of heat, also known as a drought. You still would want to tell your family where you are going unless your car stalls.
In the western U.S, Fire weather is common. It can happen anywhere, wildfires are classic examples of this.

, They can be a danger to life and crops in many ways. This is obvious, but confusion is still a problem.


When you are stranded on the interstate or highway with snow up to your doors, you should turn off your car to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning. Only turn it on in intervals for the heat. Remember to clear the exhaust pipe to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning.
Never go out if there is a risk of ice, snow, or an avalanche. You would be better off waiting until the storm is over. Don't think that you can avoid ice either, it isn't worth it.

, Heat sickness is a problem, never leave your children or pets in a hot car. The temperature goes up 10-12 degrees per hour. For example, the temperature outside can be 85 degrees while inside the car can be 97 degrees.


Do not perform strenuous exercise in the heat, heat stroke can set in a number of minutes.
Check in on any elderly neighbors and little children.
Do not become dehydrated. You should also avoid rationing water; your body needs water. Merely rationing water can make you faint in the heat, which can lead to death if the emergency services aren't called. Make sure everyone gets an adequate supply of water.

, Did you think you could beat the waters? Now that you gotten caught in the floodwaters, now is the time to do some serious thinking.


If your car is floating in the water, take your seat belt off and break your windows open. If you have a sunroof, even better! Break the glass open or if you can, use what's left of the car's battery to open it and climb out. Remember to get your children and pets out first and foremost. Note that this is for cars that are still floating.
If your car has sunk, there is still a chance to get out, cut your seatbelt off and get ready to open your door. If the pressure isn't allowing you to open it, break the window. Rescuers may be on the way so stay calm and don't thrash, you do not want to waste your energy panicking when you need to get to the surface!

, If you notice a drought and fire weather watches, a wildfire is likely imminent. Don't attempt to stay home and fight a wildfire with a hose.


If a wildfire is close but not close enough to your house or flat, start collecting your insurance papers, pets, and family. Get out of the house! Don't try to save anything else other than your life and insurance papers.
Don't stay to fight the fire, but rather leave as quickly as possible. Get out of the path of the wildfire. Your belongings can be replaced but your life, your family and pets can't. Act quickly.

Seek medical attention if you're injured.,
Do not become hostile.,
Avoid turning away.,
Do not run.,

Inform the proper authorities if geese are becoming a problem.",How to Stop a Goose Attack," You may be able to get away before a goose becomes too aggressive if you see the warning signs of an attack. Pay attention to any potential signs of aggression when you're near a goose.At first, a goose will bend its head back slightly. This indicates aggression. If the goose then bends its neck out straight, this shows the aggression is increasing.
If a goose is about to attack, it will pump its head up and down.
Geese may hiss or honk as well if they are becoming aggressive.;
, If you notice warning signs of an attack, leave before the goose begins to chase you. If the goose sees you're backing away, it may decide you're not a threat. Back away slowly until you're a good distance from the goose and it's stopped making aggressive gestures.

, In the event the goose starts chasing you, back away slowly. Stay faced towards the goose and use your peripheral vision to guide your movements. Make sure to avoid anything you may trip over, as this may give the goose reason to attack., If you appear frightened or upset, a goose could take this as a sign of aggression. It's a good idea to maintain a calm, neutral demeanor when backing away from a goose. If you're struggling to remain calm, take a few deep breaths as you back away. Keep in mind that, while geese can be territorial, an actual physical attack is very rare., In the event a goose bites you or hits you with its wings, seek medical attention. Geese are strong, and can cause injury when provoked. You may require stitches or a cast if a goose attacks you. Go to the emergency room for assessment as soon as you get away.

, If you're being chased by a goose, your inclination may be to scare it off. However, getting hostile will only be seen as aggression.Do not yell at the goose. It's better not to say anything, as to avoid provoking it.
You should also not make any physical gestures towards the goose. Do not kick, swing your arms, or throw anything at the goose.

, It's very important you face the goose until it stops pursuing you. Keep an eye on the goose at all times. Do not close your eyes or turn your back from the animal. Watch the goose carefully until it backs off., As you should keep your eye on a goose, running is not recommended. If a goose sees you running, this may encourage it to chase you more. Also, running may make you appear excited or agitated, which a goose may perceive as aggression. Even if a goose is gaining ground, remain calm and take slow, careful steps to get away., Feeding geese can easily trigger an attack. Geese may lose their fear of humans if fed too frequently. They may also become aggressive over food, going after people for not handing over food.If there are geese at a local park or nature center, encourage others to avoid feeding them. You could talk to a ranger at the park about strongly enforcing rules that prevent people from feeding geese.
If you're at a park, do not feed the geese. If you have young children, strongly discourage them from feeding the birds.

, If there are bothersome geese in your yard, consider putting up barriers. Small fences can protect you and your family from potentially aggressive geese. If there are geese at a public place, like a park, contact officials and request barriers.

, It's difficult to entirely prevent geese if you live in an area where they are prevalent. However, measures can be taken to minimize attacks. You can contact your local Department of Natural Resources to report the problem. The DNR can look into ethical solutions, such as putting up extra fences or using scare tactics like orange flyers to discourage the geese from bothering people."

Use mosquito nets to protect yourself at night.,
Insect-proof your home.,
Stay indoors when mosquitoes prefer to be outside.",How to Get Rid of Mosquitoes1," A mosquito swatter, usually made of a thicker metal or plastic than a regular fly swatter, is mounted on the end of a springy wire. This dramatically increases your chances of hitting a stationary mosquito by increasing the momentum of the swat.


Any item that will make your arm longer, and therefore your swing faster, will suffice if you don't have a swatter. Try a rolled up magazine or newspaper.
No swatter handy? Kill the flying mosquito with a double-handed clap. Using two hands is more effective than one, as the air coming from each hand will blow the mosquito into the opposing palm.;
, Keeping mosquitoes away from your body is the best way to avoid getting bitten. Use insect repellent on uncovered skin surfaces and on your clothing when you're outdoors, especially during the day. When using sunscreen, apply it before insect repellent.


Repellents containing 30% to 50% DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide) are the most popular type of repellents, and are recommended for adults and children over 2 months of age and are effective for several hours. Repellents with lower amounts of DEET offer shorter-term protection and must be applied more often.
Repellents containing up to 15% picaridin, which must be applied often, are available in the US. Picaridin is odorless, has a pleasant feel, and doesn't plasticize like DEET. Studies have shown it to be as fully repellent to mosquitoes as DEET and can also be applied on infants as young as 2 months.
Protect infants less than 2 months of age by using a carrier draped with mosquito netting with an elastic edge for a tight fit rather using a repellent.

, The safety of using chemical deterrents manufactured by combining synthetic chemicals in the laboratory has been questioned, and there are many natural solutions you can use instead. Citronella oil, cinnamon oil and castor oil are reputed to keep mosquitoes away. Most natural repellents require more frequent application or use than the chemical versions.


Oil of lemon eucalyptus is sold as a product called Repel®. Repel is a 40% formulation of naturally-derived eucalyptus and has a pleasant scent and feel without any plasticizing properties. It is also effective at repelling ticks.
Tea tree oil may be another useful natural repellent. Look for commercial repellents that include it.
Try Skin Armour Deep Woods Outdoor soap. A combined effort from the researchers in Australia and China who have worked extensively over the last decade to find a competent mosquito protection product resulted in this product. It's is a completely natural product made from a group of powerful natural oils and may help to you keep yours safe from the attack of mosquitoes while you're working or camping outdoors.

, Long-sleeved shirts and long pants will help to protect you from mosquitoes when you're outdoors. Covering your skin is a key approach to repelling mosquitoes.


Clothing may also be sprayed with repellent containing permethrin or another EPA-registered repellent for greater protection. Do not use permethrin directly on your skin.
Avoid wearing heavy, dark clothing in warm weather. Mosquitoes are attracted to warm bodies, so staying cool is an effective way to avoid bites. They also appear to like black, blue and red the most.Don't wear scent when outdoors during mosquito season. Mosquitoes are attracted to sweat, but the act of sweating can mask more effective attractors of mosquitoes, such as perfumes.

, If you're sleeping in a mosquito-infested area, get a mosquito net to drape around the bed or mat so that it touches the floor on all sides. This is the only really effective way to prevent them from getting inside to bite you, especially if there are open windows or doors in the vicinity.


Check the net for holes regularly; even overly long toenails can tear a hole in them during sleep.
Make sure you are not touching the net anywhere while you sleep.
Kennels and other pet refuges should also be covered with mosquito nets when you are experiencing a mosquito infestation.

, Check your screens and repair any that have holes or tears in them that would let mosquitoes fly in. Silicon caulk or screen patches work well. Use weather stripping to seal door gaps, especially under the doors. There's no sure way to prevent mosquitoes from coming in, but taking these measures can really help.

, They tend to come out at dusk, dawn and in the dark, so if you can, stay safely inside during these times. When you do go out during times when mosquitoes are most active, wear more layers to protect your exposed skin.

Calm yourself down.,
Look around.,
Focus on locating a reliable source of water first.,
Look to what you have with you.,
Consider the season.,
Learn about what possible plant-based foods exist in your area or in the area you're traveling to.,
Identify plants for your region.,
Catch fish.,
Consider seafood along a shoreline.,
Making a shelter is not easy.,
Read and learn about shelters.",How to Survive in the Woods without Hunting," Nothing is gained by panicking and whipping yourself into a state of fear or worry. This is a time to knuckle down and find yourself shelter, food and warmth as quickly as possible. It's also a time to conserve your strength and energy as much as possible.;
, Walk about and scout the area. You're looking for a place to sleep safely, foods you can eat, fresh water to drink and possibly ways to signal your presence, such as making rock piles forming the SOS letters.


See further How to attract attention when you need rescuing.

, You need water more than food and it must be clean or able to be made clean. For more information, check out: How to purify water, How to make water in the desert, How to sterilize water with sunlight, and How to desalinate water.

, Before you consider the need to begin foraging for food, take stock of any food you have brought with you. You're in the wilds, so perhaps you planned a picnic lunch, carried a set of energy bars or even better, have camping foods with you. Clearly, they'll have been packed and carried with your dietary needs in mind, so these are the perfect things to use first. However, since you don't know how long you'll be lost, immediately think about rationing them and about making them go further by adding food from the wild.


It is also a good idea to conserve the highest calorie foods the longest. For example, only eat very small portions of your energy bars and nuts/trail mix because these will give you the most nutritional and energy possible, while a package of crisps or candies are a lot less nutritious and energy providing.
If you have chocolate with you, eat it sparingly. It can help you to survive not only hunger but give you morale boosts if needed.

, The season will clearly impact the availability of plant foods, as will the location. A temperate winter, for example, will provide you with more options than one with below freezing temperatures and deep layers of snow.


If it's summer, look for teasel and wild grasses, along with the versatile cattail (reed mace) (Typha) if you are near a larger river, lake, or pond. Cattail rhizomes from safe waters can be eaten if scraped, and the heart can be eaten raw or boiled, while younger outer leaves can be eaten.If you're a pescatarian, you can also catch small fish (you can catch minnows by hand with some effort).






If it's spring, look for dandelion, plantains, mulberries, cattails, blackberries, and arborvitae (white cedar). Still catch fish if you're pescatarian.






If it's winter, look for bittercress, straggling dandelions and plantains, wild garlic and onion, and freshwater clams. Cattails can still be found.
If it's fall, go for fish, beech nuts, cattails, wood sorrel, blackberries, and freshwater clams. Poke weed may be useful for ink.

, Do this no matter how certain you are that you're never going to get lost. The whole point about being lost is that nobody ever expects it. However, it's actually a fun exercise anyway, and might even compel you to bring home some wild plants for eating anyway after a day's fun hike.


Consider doing a local course that offers plant identification for your area. You'll have fun learning and will meet people with interests similar to your own.
Know how to identify dangerous/toxic plants as much as the good ones. The more you know, the better your chances of long-term survival.

, This will vary from region to region, country to country, continent to continent, so you do need to identify the species wherever you are. That said, many places have the same edible weed plants, thanks to people transporting plants all over the world. Fruit trees often escape and grow wild in various places of the world, so if you know the fruit well, it'll be easy to identify. For the purposes of this article, it is assumed you're lost somewhere in North America and here are some of the plants you'll be likely to find:



Dandelions (Taraxacum officinale) and broadleaf plantains (Plantago major): Identifying dandelions and plantains is very easy. The classic yellow blossom alone is not enough to identify a dandelion securely, however.






To differentiate between the edible dandelion and the toxic false dandelion (cat's ear or Hypochaeris radicata), look at the stems and flower amount. A false dandelion will have a partially pleated stem, and when you pull it apart the stem is stringy. The stem is also a darker green on a false dandelion than a real one. A single false dandelion plant will often have more than one flower stem, while a real dandelion never has more than one flower stem. Do not try to differentiate by the leaves, because they look very similar. The image here shows the false dandelion, while the one higher up shows the true dandelion.
The broadleaf plantain test is simple: If you see a low-to-the-ground plant with visible veins running through the leaf vertically, pick it. Then pull it in half slowly. If a white vein sticks out, it's plantain. If this doesn't work, pick another and try quickly.



Beech nuts (from Fagus grandifolia): These are spiny nuts found on hardwood trees. If you partially scrape the bark off the young tree's trunk and try to stick your fingernail in the wood, a beech tree will be unscathed. A softwood tree with spiny nuts will be toxic.

Arbor-vitae (thuja or redcedars/whitcedars): Look for an evergreen with flat needles that look like there are chain links on them. Eat the bitter needles for vitamin C. Do not consume too much of this, as the volatile oil is toxic and overdosing is possible.Avoid using if pregnant.

Wild garlic (Allium vineale - invasive species where introduced, also known as crow garlic): This is a grass with round blades. The best way to identify it is to pick one blade and smell. A strong garlic smell will emanate from wild garlic. Wild garlic has many tiny bulbs, and if you are a risk-taker, you can try to ""farm"" wild garlic. You can pull it up using both hands wrapped around the bunch of grass.

Wild onion greens (Allium canadense): These basically look like onion greens from a supermarket. The onion bulb is single, but about the size of the circle made from your thumb and forefinger. You cannot pull up an onion; if you try you will simply break off the greens. You have to dig it with a stick or a knife if you have one. Using a blunt butter knife is a great survival tool: it's a good digging tool and can also be used for many other things.

Onion weed (Allium triquetrum): This ""weed"" species is also known as three-cornered leek. The bulb, stem and flowers are edible.Mock wild strawberries (Duchesnea indica): Also known as wood strawberries, these are small red seed-covered berries growing on short stalks from the ground in late spring. They are bland but nutritious.

Wild strawberries (Fragaria): The fruits are edible and tasty too.

Amaranth (Amaranthus): This is an edible weed and all of it is edible; it is best to boil the leaves to reduce the nitrate and oxalic acid levels but can be eaten raw if needed.Clover (Trifolium): Edible leaves, best cooked but can be eaten raw too.This plant is ubiquitous and is found on most continents.

, Just go near the water and look for fish. After about half an hour at the water, you will have hand-caught a fish or two if you know how to fish by hand. Be aware that this is easier in some places than others and can be potentially dangerous if you're near waves, near deep/cold water or the fish bite.


Read How to catch fish with your hands, How to catch trout with your bare hands and How to make a handmade fishing net for more details.
Steal leftovers from fisher-animals. Some birds and small mammals catch fish; you could follow them and try to steal some of their catch. Do not do this with large mammals such as bears, unless you fancy being their next lunch. Consider the amount of energy you'll expend doing this though; always weigh this into any food collecting.

, If you know which seafood is safe to collect from shorelines, you can supplement your diet using this. However, you must know the seafood type and also the safety of the waters. Risks include seafood poisoning, algal bloom toxicity, being stung or pierced by toxic creatures or being taken by a rogue wave. A lot of seafood must be cooked before eating; read up on this and learn well before trying anything. If you didn't read up before getting lost, err on the side of avoiding seafood unless someone with you is properly knowledgeable.


If you live where people still gather seafood from the shore regularly to supplement their diet, ask them to show you how to forage this way safely before you go on walks, hikes and camping trips. After a few trips with experienced hands, you should be very knowledgeable.






Don't neglect the potential of seaweed or kelp for a healthy meal. Many varieties are edible; again, learn about the ones in your local area.

, It's a really good idea to practice making shelters at home first or to do a local course with people are properly skilled at making wild shelters. There are many ways to make shelters, here are just a few:


Build a tepee-type structure with tree branches formed around a central sapling about thumb thickness.
Dig a deep, wide hole in sand (on a beach or sandy desert area maybe) and cover the top with tree branches and leaves at night when you sleep in the hole. Be careful though; if the walls collapse in, you could suffocate. Don't make it too deep.
Build a cup-shaped nest structure out of tree branches up in the crotch of two branches on a tree. This is important for when being off the ground ensures safety, such as over a swamp, to avoid prowling animals or to avoid flash flooding, etc. See How to build a swamp bed for more details.

, Here are a few suggestions for you to check out: How to build an A frame shelter, How to build a sturdy and warm shelter, How to build an emergency winter shelter, How to build a tarp shelter and How to make a shelter in the wilderness. There are many more possibilities in the outdoor shelter category.

Use a long weapon.,
Keep to the ostrich’s side.,
Aim for the neck.,
Damage its wings.,
Go for its legs.",How to Survive an Encounter with an Ostrich2," If you are forced to defend yourself against an ostrich, avoid close-quarters combat. Keep as far out of reach of its legs as you can. Use the nearest, longest object that could be used as a weapon, such as a pole, rake, broom, or branch.If you have a gun and need to use it, aim for the ostrich's main body to better ensure hitting your target. Although they will be attacking with their legs and/or beak, their legs and neck are very thin and easy to miss.

, Consider yourself at the most risk when the two of you are face-to-face. Remember that an ostrich is only able to kick its legs directly in front of it. Stay behind or to the side of the bird as much as possible to keep clear of its most powerful weapon., Consider this to be the ostrich’s weakest body part. Strike it where it is most vulnerable and least protected to defeat it more quickly.Failing that, aim for its breast. Concentrate your efforts between the two as opportunity affords. Continue to strike until it quits and runs away., If the ostrich refuses to give up despite your attacks to its neck, aim for its wings when given the opportunity. Know that an ostrich uses its wings not for flight, but to alter course more smoothly when running, just like a ship’s rudder.Damaging its wings may marginally improve your chances of running away in a zigzag fashion if you are forced to retreat.

, If you find yourself behind or to the side of the ostrich with an easy shot to one of its legs, take it. Know that the ostrich’s center of gravity depends entirely upon those two skinny legs.If given the chance, deliver one or both a blow to upset its balance, speed, and striking power.

Be aware of your surroundings.,
Avoid close contact.,
Beware ostriches during breeding season.",How to Survive an Encounter with an Ostrich3," Whenever you are in an area that may be home to ostriches, evaluate the landscape. Avoid open areas. Stick close to cover and note which areas would be the most safe to retreat to should you encounter an ostrich that charges you., Maintain your distance when you spot an ostrich in the wild. Consider any distance less than 110 yards (100 meters) as too close. If an ostrich advances toward you, back away, even if the ostrich appears calm. Never back one into a corner, since this will trigger a “fight” response instead of a “flight” one.Although images of people petting, kissing, and even riding ostriches may lead you to believe that it is safe to approach them, note that such images are of tamed ostriches from farms. Even these birds should be treated with the same caution and respect as wild ones to avoid injury.

, Consider them to be at their most easily provoked at this time, especially males, who are tasked with protecting the female’s eggs.Since ostriches tend to roam in pairs or alone at other times of the year, recognize breeding season by the presence of herds numbering anywhere from 5 to 50 ostriches at a time.Identify males by their black feathers, white wingtips and tail plumes, and the red flush that appears on the front of their legs.
Distinguish females by their brown feathers and gray wingtips and plumes."

Understand that treatment is generally symptomatic.,
Keep your child from scratching the bite, regardless of what insect bit him.,
Apply topical corticosteroid cream to the bite.,
Try calamine lotion.,
Place an ice pack on the bite.,
Consider giving your child antihistamines.,
Recognize symptoms of a mild reaction, regardless of the type of insect.",How to Treat Insect Bites in Toddlers1," In general, treatment of insect bites in toddlers is symptomatic, meaning you treat the symptoms caused by the bite, like itching, rather than the bite itself.


In general, these symptomatic treatments include washing the bite and applying soothing lotions. These will be covered in the following steps.;
, Try as much as possible to prevent your toddler from scratching the affected area because scratching the bite can make the itching worse, and may cause an infection if your child manages to break the skin.


Try to keep your child from scratching bites on the arms and legs by dressing him in long sleeves and long pants. If the bite is on his feet or ankles, put socks on your child.

, Topical corticosteroid creams are used to control inflammation at the bite area, and itching.There are several types of corticosteroid creams that range from very potent, to less potent. The one you choose to use will depend on your toddler's specific bite.


Examples of corticosteroid creams that you may use for your toddler are Aveeno, Bactine, Cortaid and Dermolate. Apply the cream to the area one to three times a day. Apply a small “dot” of cream and spread it over the affected area.

, Calamine lotion is an over-the-counter lotion used most commonly to relieve pain, itching and minor skin irritation caused by insect bites. Apply the cream one to three times a day. You can use a cotton pad to apply the cream. Allow the lotion to dry completely on the skin.Do not get the calamine lotion in your child’s eyes, nose, or genital area.

, You can use ice wrapped in a cloth or a cold compress to relieve the itching sensation caused by the bite.However, do not apply ice directly to your child’s skin, as the ice can burn your child’s sensitive skin.


Hold the cold compress to the bite for 15 to 20 minutes.

, In rare cases, you may need to administer medications such as oral antihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benadryl). This, however, should only be used if your child is having an allergic reaction to the bite.


Talk to your doctor before giving your child antihistamines of any kind. There are child-friendly antihistamines available at most pharmacies.

, Most insect bites will usually only result in mild local reactions that are contained within the area where the insect bit or stung your toddler. Among these reactions are:


Itching: this is the most common manifestation of an insect bite and happens because your body attempts to combat the poison or saliva of the insect. Your child's body releases histamine, which can create an intense itching sensation in the spot where the insect bit your toddler.
Swelling: this occurs directly over the bite site. Swelling is also a result of histamine being sent to the area to combat the toxin released by the insect
Redness: your toddler’s body will also send blood to the area, which will cause the bite site to turn red.

Be mindful of your environment.,
Stay calm.,
Walk away.,
Make loud noises.",How to Survive an Encounter With a Snake1," If there is a chance that you might run into a snake, take care to be very observant. If you are going on a hike or camping, you should be conscious of your surroundings. Be aware of where snakes are most likely to appear.When you are hiking, stay on the trail as much as possible. You might still encounter a snake, but it is less likely than if you wander off of the trail.
Avoid tall grass. These areas are very appealing to many types of snakes.
Snakes like to hide under rocks and logs. Be careful when walking near these areas. Keep your eyes open and be on the lookout for snakes.
You should also use caution when rock climbing. Snakes like to hide in nooks and crannies. Look before placing your hand somewhere on the rock.;
, Ideally, being mindful of your environment will help you to stay away from snakes. However, that is not always possible. If you do encounter a snake, there are several things you can do to remain safe.Try not to panic. Staying calm can help you make the right decisions and help you to stay safe.
Don't make any sudden movements in the direction of the snake. Just remain calm, and try not to startle the animal.
Remember that the snake was not out looking for you. It likely was just trying to find a place to get warm.

, One of the most effective ways to survive an encounter with a snake is to not engage. If you come across a snake in your path, walk away. If you can't turn and go the other direction, make sure to give the snake a wide berth as you circle around it.Remember that most snakes have no desire to be around people. That is why you rarely see them.
If you see a snake in your yard or garden, just stay away from it. It is likely that the snake will flee when it sees you.
Sometimes you might encounter an aggressive snake or one that is cornered. The same advice applies. Do not try to capture the snake. Just head the other direction.

, Loud sounds can help you to drive a snake from your path. Snakes don't have ears, but they are very sensitive to vibrations. Loud sounds are likely to make a snake flee to a more quiet place.Raise your voice. Try shouting, ""Go away, snake!"" or simply just yelling.
Stomp your feet loudly. You can also try banging some sticks together.
If you have a snake visiting your yard or garden, noise should help you get rid of him. Turn on the lawn mower nearby as a way to make some noise.

Use citronella products to repel them.,
Burn other essential oils.,
Put out a dish of soapy water.,
Use lighting that doesn't attract mosquitoes.,
Screen or cover outdoor spaces.,
Grow some garlic in your yard.,
Use a mosquito trapping system.",How to Get Rid of Mosquitoes2," Mosquitoes don't like to go near citronella oil. In addition to using it on your body, citronella oil can be used in the following ways to keep mosquitoes away from your property:


Burn a citronella candle or torch. The smoke in the air may help keep away some bugs.
Plant a citronella plant in a pot on your porch.To use, you can snap off a twig and rub it over your skin and around the perimeter of your porch––the smell may discourage mosquitoes.
Use citronella incense coils. Check for the other ingredients in these and don't sit in the line of the smoke from them, as any smoke inhalation is potentially unhealthy.

, Get an oil burner and use a candle to heat some water and an essential oil like lemon eucalyptus, lavender or catnip (a mixture of few oil types is preferred). The heat of the candle will evaporate the oil into the air, and both the heat and the repellent oils will help to create a 2 to 3 meter (6.6 to 9.8 ft) radius of mosquito-free zone. , If you're having an outdoor meal, you can keep mosquitoes away by placing a dish of water with some dish soap in a discreet place nearby. The mosquitoes will be attracted to the water source, and they'll get trapped in the soap bubbles and drown., Place yellow LED lights around doorways, windows and porches. Mosquitoes won't hang around if the light is sourced from yellow LEDs, bug lights or sodium lamps., If you live in a place with a big mosquito infestation, you might want to use a net or screen outside as well as inside. Place a suitable net or clear outdoor covering around your porch or outdoor area. A waterproof one will help to keep out the rain, the snow and all the bugs, too.

, Eating garlic daily to repel mosquitoes has not been proven effective in scientific studies,but, some people believe it has an impact when used as a barrier. Since garlic is delicious, it can't hurt to grow it, but don't rely on it as the only source of repelling the pests.


Plant garlic around your house to repel mosquitoes. It can be integrated around your house, on a balcony, etc.Garlic powder from your local grocer sprinkled all through your yard may create a mosquito repellent. Sprinkle a little extra thickly around the patio and porch areas. This may protect pets from being bitten if they sleep in that area., Mosquitoes can be effectively killed using a dedicated machine that employs heat and carbon dioxide to attract the mosquitoes and then entrap or kill them using nets, containers or chemicals. While these mosquito trapping systems can be expensive, they're quite effective, and worth looking into if you're committed to keeping your yard mosquito-free.


Mosquito trapping systems won't eliminate all of the mosquitoes from your yard. Every neighborhood tends to have more than one species of mosquito breeding in the area, and different types of trapping systems cater to different species. Ask around in your area to find out what type of trapping system has worked well for others.Avoid using an electric ""zapper"". These have been shown to kill many bugs very effectively, but generally the bugs killed are the non-harmful ones.Plus, the noise they generate tends to be obnoxious.

"
"
Dump or flush out any stagnant water sources in your yard.,
Maintain water features and swimming pools.,
Keep your grass mowed regularly and trim your shrubs.",How to Get Rid of Mosquitoes3," Mosquitoes are often attracted to water, especially standing water. Examples of mosquito breeding grounds include old tires, driveway puddles, clogged gutters, unfiltered fish ponds, empty flowerpots, and any item that can hold water for more than a few days at a time.


Use a push broom to distribute the water for small puddles on hard surfaces. Use a siphon pump for larger puddles.
If you're inundated by mosquitoes due to standing water from street curbs, drainage ditches or other pools you cannot control, call the responsible public authority to explain that you believe the water has become a mosquito breeding source.
If it is not possible to remove particular water source, place some Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (BTI) dunks/granules into the water. BTI is a species of bacteria that functions as a larvicide and will kill mosquito larvae for as long as a month, in addition to being safe and non-toxic to children/pets., If you have a koi pond or swimming pool that doesn't see much use, it may become a breeding ground for mosquitoes. Do yourself and your neighbors a favor by doing regular maintenance to keep the water fresh and flowing.Cut back vegetation from around your pond or other water features.
If you have a birdbath or another small source of water, change the water frequently or agitate it so mosquitoes won't lay eggs there.
Treat your pool with the proper chemicals to make it uninhabitable for mosquitoes.

, Too much grass and shrubbery can create breeding and hiding grounds for mosquitoes. Be sure to regularly mow your lawn and use hedge trimmers to cut back shrubs and other vegetation.

Recognize the infamous mosquito bite.,
Look for flea bites.,
Recognize bee, wasp, hornet, and yellow jacket sting marks.,
Combat pesky deer flies.,
Look for pustules caused by fire ants.,
Consider whether the bites could be from bed bugs.",How to Treat Insect Bites in Toddlers2," One of the most common types of insect bite that you will encounter is that of a mosquito bite. Mosquito bites will generally last for 2 to 15 days. Symptoms of a mosquito bite include:


A red, raised bump that forms at the bite site.
Itching and tenderness in the area of the bite.

, Fleas are small insects that are most commonly found on pets. If your toddler has been bitten by fleas, you should be able to find multiple, grouped red bumps that each have a central puncture bite.Flea bites are also extremely itchy.

, When a bee stings, the stinger generally falls off the bee and remains in the skin. Wasps, hornets and yellow jackets, on the other hand, can sting multiple times because they do not lose their stingers. Regardless of which insect stung your toddler, the sting itself will be very painful.The area may also become swollen and red. Gradually the spot where the stinger went in will turn white.
If your child is allergic to bee stings, you should get him or her to the hospital immediately. Signs of an allergic reaction include hives, difficulty breathing, the throat and tongue becoming swollen, dizziness, weak heartbeat, nausea, and loss of consciousness.

, Deer fly bites are painfulbecause this sort of insect has a sharp, knife-like mouth. The bite may become red and swollen. Deer flies live in moist damp environs like wetlands and forests., Fire ants latch on to the skin with their jaws and then sting the person they have attached on to. Both of these acts can be extremely painful and can be described as a ‘burning’ sensation, which is why they are called fire ants.

Their bites may also cause pustules or pimples to form at the bite site.

, Like fleas, bedbugs are tiny parasitic insects that are often found in peoples’ beds. Bed bugs don’t really pose a health threat because they are generally not thought of as disease carriers, but their bites can be very itchy and annoying."
"
Treat a mosquito bite.,
Apply a cold compress to deal with bees, wasps, hornets and yellow jacket wounds.,
Try a topical cream for flea bites.,
Deal with a fire ant bite.,
Clean a bedbug bite.",How to Treat Insect Bites in Toddlers3," Mosquito bite symptoms, such as itching and inflammation, can be reduced when you apply calamine lotion to the bite spot. You can also rub an ice cube on the bite to numb the area so that your child won’t feel as much of an itching sensation.If you are in an area where mosquitoes carry dengue fever, monitor your child for 7 to 15 days. If your child develops a fever during that time, take your child to the hospital, as the mosquito may have been carrying dengue fever.

, If your child has been stung but is not showing signs of an allergic reaction, remove the stinger and then clean the site with water and soap. Apply a cold compress to the area. If the itching or pain is very bad, consider giving your child an antihistamine (for the itching) or ibuprofen (for the pain). However, consult your doctor about these medications before giving them to your child.


If your child has an allergic reaction to the sting (as described in the previous method) bring him or her to the hospital immediately.

, Flea bites can be itchy and painful. To reduce these symptoms, apply a small amount of topical corticosteroid cream or calamine lotion to the spot.If your pet is carrying the fleas that bit your child, you can learn more about getting rid of fleas here.


, First check to make sure that your child did not sustain multiple bites. If multiple bites occurred, seek medical attention. If your child was only bitten once, apply a cold compress to the area.You can also apply a topical antihistamine cream to the area, or you can use a corticosteroid cream.


If your child is in a great deal of pain, consider giving him or her ibuprofen.

, If your child has been bitten by bed bugs, wash the site with water and soap. After the site is clean, apply calamine lotion or a local antihistamine cream to relieve the itching sensation that comes with bed bug bites.

Look for signs that your child is having difficulty breathing.,
Ask your child if he is having difficulty swallowing.,
Use a thermometer to see if your child has a fever.,
Take your child to the doctor if you think he may have hypotension (low blood pressure).,
Take your child to the hospital if you see these symptoms.",How to Treat Insect Bites in Toddlers4," When a child has a severe reaction to an insect bite, his respiratory airways may become constricted. This can cause the child to have a hard time breathing., As stated above, a severe reaction can cause your child’s airways to constrict. This can also cause the child to have a hard time swallowing. Inflammation in the throat can also occur.

, Your child’s immune system will kick in when it realizes that venom has entered the body. The body fights off infection and other pathogens by increasing the internal temperature of the body, thus causing a fever.


Fevers are body temperatures that reach above the normal 36.5 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit).

, Hypotension occurs when the venom reaches the cardiovascular system and causes coronary spasms. These spasms occur in the heart’s arterial system (which includes the arteries). This can cause low blood pressure.


Low blood pressure can lead to shock.

, Immediate medical attention must be administered in severe reactions. Usually, anaphylaxis and these other severe symptoms develop within 5 to 30 minutes of the bite occurring.

Keep the victim calm.,
Seek medical attention.,
Use basic first aid.,
Be prepared.",How to Survive an Encounter With a Snake2," In some cases, you might not be able to avoid a very close encounter with a snake. Unfortunately, snake bites do occur. If you or a friend experience a snake bite, there are several steps you can take to effectively deal with the situation.Make sure that the person who was bitten does not panic. Remaining calm can be difficult, but it will definitely help the situation.
If you are bitten, avoid moving around. Restricting your movement will help to reduce the flow of venom.
Sometimes you may not be certain if you or your friend were actually bitten. Be familiar with common symptoms of snake bites.
You may see fang marks or swelling at the wound. Fever, dizziness, and weakness are also common symptoms.

, You need to seek professional help for any snake bite. Even if you think it is minor, call a doctor. Depending on where you are, you may need to call an ambulance.Call 911. The dispatcher might direct you to either take the patient to the nearest clinic or hospital, or they might send an ambulance.
Antivenom needs to be administered to snake bite victims. There are different types of antivenom.
Try to tell the doctor or operator what type of snake it was. If you don't know, try to describe its appearance.
You can also call the National Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222. They can offer advice on treatment and are available 24/7., You should seek medical assistance for any snake bite, no matter the severity. If you can't immediately get the victim to a treatment facility, you can use basic first aid.Remove any rings, jewelry, or clothing around the area. This will help prevent swelling.
Gently clean the wound with water and a clean cloth. Do not flush the wound with water.
Wrap the wounded limb with compression bandages. Apply these bandages as you would to a sprained ankle, wrapping firmly but not too tight. Keep wrapping the bandages about 4 inches above the wound.
Do not apply a tourniquet. Do not try to suck the venom out by mouth.

, Know that anytime you are spending time in the outdoors you could encounter a snake. This is especially true during the warm summer months. If you are going camping or hiking, be prepared for snakes.Bring a first aid kit with you. If you are hiking or camping, you should have basic supplies.
Your kit should include compression bandages, antibiotic ointment, and gauze. You should also pack a pamphlet with first aid guidelines.Take plenty of bottle water with you. You can use it to hydrate a snake bite victim, and clean wounds.
Carry a cell phone. You will need it to call for help if you or a companion is bitten by any snake.

Observe the snake's posture.,
Recognize poisonous snakes.,
Stay away from rattle snakes.,
Get rid of a snake.",How to Survive an Encounter With a Snake3," Not all snakes are dangerous. However, it is a good rule of thumb to avoid any snakes you encounter in the wild. Certain signals can tell you whether the snake in question is particularly dangerous.Pay attention to the snake's position. A coiled snake is likely getting ready to strike.
If you encounter a rattle snake, back away slowly. If the snake is coiled and audibly rattling, it is getting ready to strike.
Be aware that a snake can strike from any position. It can strike the furthest distance from a coiled position, but it can also attack from a stretched out position.

, There is no full proof way to tell if the snake you encounter is venomous. It's a good idea to assume that it is, and move along. Venomous snakes do carry some common traits that are good indicators that they are poisonous.Poisonous snakes in the United States are almost all pit vipers. Pit vipers have heat-seaking pits on their snouts that help them to locate prey.
Many poisonous snakes have triangular heads. The water moccasin, rattle snake, and copperhead all have pointed heads and are venomous.
The water moccasin is also known as a cotton mouth, and is found in many southern waterways. It's venom can cause muscle and tissue damage.
The coral snake is the exception to many rules, and is the most venomous snake in the US. It has a rounded head, rounded pupils, and is more brightly colored than other snakes.

, Hikers and fishermen frequently encounter rattlesnakes. These snakes live in all parts of the continental United States. They are particular common in the Southwest.You can identify a rattlesnake by looking for the distinct, noise-making scales at the end of its tale. Be aware that not all rattlesnakes will actively be rattling. They are still dangerous.
Rattlesnakes are strong swimmers. Be on the lookout for them if you are fishing in a stream, lake, or river.
The rattlesnake has hollow, retractable fangs. These fangs appear when the snake strikes and can inject large amounts of venom in their victim.

, The best thing to do when you encounter a snake is to walk away and let it be. However, sometimes you may feel that you absolutely need to get rid of the snake. Make sure to keep safety as your top priority.If you find a snake in your yard, you might worry about it biting your children or pets. To send it on its way, spray it gently with a garden hose. Stand a good distance away while you spray.
If you find a snake in your house, try to isolate it in one room. If you're sure it is not dangerous, you can set a glue trap to catch the snake, and then set it free.
Call animal control. Each city has experts that can come help you deal with the snake who is invading your space.

Do not panic.,
Do not run.,
Retreat slowly.,
Be prepared again.",How to Survive a Lion Attack1," If you’re being charged by a lion, you’ll be extremely frightened. Do everything you can not to panic. Staying calm and thinking straight can help save your life. Knowing what to expect can help you stay calm. For example, know that the lion is going to growl while they charge. This can shake the ground beneath you but know this is normal for a lion attack., Stand your ground. You need to take charge of the situation and show the lion that you’re a threat. Turn so that you’re side-on-side with the lion while clapping your hands, shouting, and waving your arms. This will make you appear bigger and threatening to the lion.Lion behaviors differ from region to region. The biggest tourist attractions have lions that are more habituated to vehicles and therefore less afraid of humans. However, many lions with early encounters of humans will perform mock charges. Making yourself appear threatening will make them turn away.

, Do not turn your back. Keep flailing your arms and showing, but slowly step away sideways. If you run, the lion may sense your fear and chase after you. Remain threatening to the lion while you retreat.Avoid retreating to a thicket (such as a forest). Instead, retreat to an open area.

, The lion may charge you again while you’re trying to retreat. If this happens, shout as loudly as possible and raise your hands again. Truly yell from the depths of your stomach. This time, when it turns away, stop the aggression. Turn sideways and walk away. This can help avoid a fight."

, If you see a Jaguar that doesn't spot you, then don't disturb it.

, If the Jaguar spots you, avoid eye contact, this can be seen as a challenge.

, You will be viewed as prey, plus, Jaguars are faster than you.

, If the Jaguar charges at you, don't run, instead, hold your ground, wave your arms and shout, making yourself seem bigger and more dangerous than you really are.

, If the Jaguar does not stop charging, poking it in the eye or punching it on the nose could well discourage it from pressing its attack.

, The jaguar is a very unusual killer. Rather than biting the neck, it goes for the back of the head to pierce the brain and kill the prey. Protecting your head could help you survive, although this cat has very strong teeth.

Avoid strong scents.,
Tie your hair back.Bees may become trapped in loose or long hair.,
Avoid bright, patterned, and black clothing.,
Wear tight, protective clothing, especially if you know bees will be around.Long pants and a long-sleeved shirt can protect you from getting stung if bees are nearby or known to live in an area you will visit.,
Wear close-toed shoes.,
Know the risks of pesticides.,
Be observant when drinking sweet beverages outside.Sugary drinks are similar to nectar and may attract bees.,
Keep food and trash covered.Bees might be attracted to the scent of food and trash, so keep these covered if you are outdoors.,
Stay away from beehives.Your chances of getting stung are higher if you are near a hive, since bees will be protective of it.,
Keep car windows rolled up.,
Don’t swat at bees.Slapping, waving, and swatting at bees with your hand or an object may irritate them and increase the possibility that you will be stung.

,
Stay calm if a bee lands on you.If a bee lands on you, it is probably just investigating an odor (or getting water if you are sweating).,
Leave the area immediately if you see lots of bees.Bees sometimes swarm.,
Leave the area immediately if you are stung.,
Care for the wound if you are stung.,
Seek medical attention if the attack was severe.",How to Stop a Bee from Stinging You," Bees are attracted to or react to odors.Avoid wearing perfumes, colognes, or other heavy scents, or using scented soaps, shampoos, and basically anything that makes you smell nice if you're going anywhere near a hive or wasps nest.;
, If you tie your hair back, however, a bee can easily fly away if it lands on your head by mistake.

, Brightly colored or patterned clothing (especially floral prints) may attract bees.On the other hand, they may also be attracted to very dark clothing, so avoid wearing black. Instead, choose khaki, beige, or blue colors., If bees are present, they can get caught between loose clothing and your skin.Snug-fitting clothing will keep bees out and prevent stings.


If you have to work around bees, wear a beekeeper’s hat or a mesh covering over your head, and tuck your pants into your shoes or socks. You can also wrap tape snugly around the angles of your pants and the ends of your sleeves to keep bees from flying up your clothing., Good footwear will protect your feet when you are outdoors. Bees will hover in and around low ground cover like clover, so it is especially important to wear close-toed shoes if you will be near such an area., Applying insect repellents or bug sprays to your skin or clothing will not keep bees away.If you want to use a pesticide or repellant anyway, remember that they can be hazardous to your health and to the environment.Always follow usage directions exactly.

, You will want to choose the right drinking vessel. Bees can enter small-mouth cans and bottles without you realizing it, increasing your chances of getting stung. Using a wide-mouth cup makes it easier to see if a bee has landed in your drink. A lid and/or straw can also help keep bees out of your drink.,


Keep trash in containers with tight-fitting lids.
Use dishes with lids to cover your food if you are eating outdoors.

, If you see a hive, leave the area. Don’t touch or poke it.If you see lots of bees flying to and/or from the same place, or hear lots of buzzing, chances are there is a hive nearby, and you should move to another area.If you see a hive in, on, or near your home, contact a professional pest control service to have it safely removed., Bees may fly into your car if the windows are down. If a bee is already inside your car, stop, roll down the windows, and wait for it to fly out.,, Remain calm, wait a moment, and soon it will realize that you are not a flower and fly on. If you do not want to wait, then gently brush the bee off of you with a piece of paper, or blow gently at it to encourage it to move on., If you see many bees together, or if a swarm flies near you, cover your mouth with your hand or a cloth and quickly but calmly get away.


Swatting at bees is a bad idea, because may aggravate them and increase your chances of being stung. However, you should also not “freeze” in place if you see bees, since that would make them fly to you.Don’t try to get away from bees by hiding in a pool, pond, lake, etc. They may just wait for you to resurface., When a bee stings you, it releases a chemical that may attract other bees.Get away and seek shelter indoors or in a car.

, Most people will have only a mild reaction to a bee sting, with some swelling and minor pain. Putting ice on a sting can reduce swelling and irritation.


Honey bees (unlike bumblebees, wasps and hornets) will leave their stinger in your skin after they sting you. To remove it, gently scrape your fingernail across it.Don’t try to squeeze or pinch it out, as this can just drive the stinger deeper into your skin.

, If you are stung many, many times, or if you are stung and know that you are allergic to bee stings, you should seek medical assistance as soon as possible to make sure that you are alright. If you see any of the following symptoms, you may be having a severe (potentially life-threatening) allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to bee stings and someone should help you get medical assistance immediately:Hives, itching, pale or flushed skin
Difficulty breathing
Swelling of your throat and/or tongue
A weak or rapid pulse
Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea
Dizziness or fainting
Loss of consciousness

Locate the head and sucker.,
Slide your fingernail under the sucker.,
Treat the open wound.,
Consider letting leeches fill up and drop off.,
Avoid removing leaches by any other means.,
See how deeply the leech has burrowed.,
Use alcohol if it's in your mouth.,
Puncture the leech if it's getting too big.,
Get medical attention if it can't be removed.,
Get treated immediately if you show signs of a leech allergy.,
Be wary when you're in areas known for having leeches.,
Wear long sleeves and pants.,
Use insect repellent.",How to Remove Leeches," The head is the narrower part of the leech, and the sucker where it attaches to your skin. If the leech is located on one of your arms, legs, your torso, or another easily accessible area, you should be able to remove it yourself. Otherwise, you'll need someone else to help you take it off.If you find one leech, you should check your entire body to see if there are more. Leeches inject an anesthetic into your skin when sink in their teeth, so their bites are painless. You may not be able to feel the presence of other leeches elsewhere on your body.
Remember that leeches aren't poisonous and they don't carry diseases, so don't panic when you find one. Leeches are usually quite easy to remove and won't cause any long-term harm.;
, Use one hand to gently pull the skin near the sucker taught, then place your other hand next to the leech and slide one of your fingernails underneath the sucker. The leech will immediately begin attempting to reattach itself, so flick it off right away.


Do not yank off the leech, since this will leave its sucker attached to your body.
If you're squeamish about using your fingernail to remove the leech, you can use the edge of a credit card, a sturdy piece of paper or any other thin object instead.

, When leeches latch on, they inject an anticoagulant to prevent the blood from clotting before they can get their fill. When you remove a leech, it might bleed for several hours or even days before the anticoagulant leaves your system. Be prepared for the sight of profuse bleeding when you take the leech off. Cleanse the open wound with rubbing alcohol or another first aid cleansing solution, then apply a bandage to protect it.


Since the bleeding might take awhile to stop, you should change the bandage regularly in the meantime.
It's important to treat the area as you would any open wound, especially if you're hiking around in a jungle. Open wounds are more susceptible to getting infected in jungle environments.Expect the wound to itch while it heals.

, If you can stand it, an easy way to get rid of a leech is by letting it drop off on its own. It takes around 20 minutes for a leech to fill up, and when it's done feeding it will fall off your skin. Leeches don't take enough blood for blood loss to be a worry here, and since they don't spread disease, there's really no harm in letting them fall of without intervening.The practice of letting leeches feed on human blood for medical purposes has been done for thousands of years, and ""leech therapy"" continues to be medically important.The FDA has approved the use of leeches to help with circulation problems and to aid in tissue reattachment, You might have heard that you can remove a leech by pouring salt on it, burning it, spraying it with repellant or drowning it in shampoo. While these techniques might cause the leech to release its grip and fall off, it won't do so before vomiting back into the wound. This can lead to bad infections, so stick to the healthier practice of simply using a fingernail or other straightedge to get under the sucker., Sometimes leeches find their way into orifices, like the nostrils, ear canals and mouth. This is especially common when you're swimming among leeches. When this happens, it can be difficult to reach the sucker and use the simple leech removal method. Do your best to remove it the easy way before trying alternative methods.


See if someone can help you slide something under the sucker. Be very careful not to poke yourself, though. Do not use this method if you can't see the sucker.
You can try to let the leech finish sucking and fall off, but if it's inside a tiny space it might get too big and cause problems.

, If the leech has attached itself to the inside of your mouth, you might be able to cause it to fall off by rinsing your mouth with vodka or another strong alcohol. Rinse it around your mouth for about 30 seconds, then spit. Check to see if the leech is gone.If you don't have alcohol on hand, hydrogen peroxide may also work.
If the leech is still there after you spit, and doesn't fall off on its own, you need to seek medical attention.

, If you're in a remote area and don't have immediate access to a doctor, you might need to puncture the leech. Hopefully you will have been able to remove it via another method, but if it's in a really tricky place, like your nostril, you might need to pop the leech before it obstructs your breathing. To do this, take a sharp knife and simply pop through the skin. It's not going to be pretty, but the leech will die and you should have an easier time getting to the sucker.


Remove the leech's body and immediately wash the area.
If signs of infection occur, seek medical attention as soon as possible.

, If you have a leech far up your nose, in your ear canal or in another place that's impossible to reach, go to the doctor to get it removed. The doctor will be able to use instruments to remove the leech without hurting you.

, Few people are allergic to leeches, but it does happen. If you experience dizziness, a rash, shortness of breath or swelling, take an antihistamine (such as Benadryl) and seek medical attention right away., Land leeches are common in the jungles of Africa and Asia, and they're also found in freshwater lakes and ponds across the world. If you're planning a trip to a place known for having leeches, bring the right gear with you to minimize the chances that you'll get bitten.


Land leeches tend to live in muddy and leafy areas in the jungle. If you stand in one place long enough, they'll start crawling toward you. Try to avoid touching trees and plants, and check yourself often for leeches.
Water leeches are attracted to movement, so splashing around and swimming might put you at greater risk., Leeches are attracted to the exposed skin of warm-blooded animals. Wearing long sleeves and pants will protect you from getting bitten, although you'll probably find leeches trying to get through the fabric. If you're especially concerned about getting bitten, wear gloves and a head covering so that no skin is left exposed.


Wear close-toed shoes instead of sandals.
If you're planning a longer jungle expedition, it's worth investing in a pair of leech-proof socks.

, While this isn't a foolproof measure for avoiding leeches, it'll prevent them from piling on. Spray your skin and clothes with a standard insect repellent, and reapply it every few hours while you're in a leech-infested area. Here are a few other tricks you can try to repel them:


Put loose tobacco in your socks. It's said that leeches don't like the smell.
Rub soap or detergent on your hands and clothes."

Add a low level rattlesnake proof fence around the backyard.,
Remove shrubs, overhanging vegetation and any other plants from the perimeter of the fence.,
Check under and around the house.,
Keep wood piles and any other materials stored in your backyard away from the home.,
Keep the rodents under control.,
Keep other food sources out of the reach of snakes.,
Eliminate rattlesnake homes and nesting-sites.,
Keep lawns and fields around the house mowed.,
Know your snakes!,
Remain calm.",How to Rattlesnake Proof a Backyard," While this is not a cheap option, it does work and can reassure you that a particular zone of your home is safe from rattlesnakes. In fact, you don't need to even wall off the whole backyard - you can select an area for the children to play in, for pets to frolic in and for entertainment purposes and only fence off that part. This becomes the ""safety zone"". Just make sure these specifications are followed in order for the fence to be effective:


Use mesh that is not wider than a quarter of an inch in diameter or use solid material. Any untextured material is best because snakes cannot climb smooth surfaces as they cannot get a grip.
Make the fence to a minimum height of three feet.
Take care with corners, so as not to create a ""bellyhold"" (snake for ""toehold"") on the fence.
Bury the fence to a minimum of 12 inches (30.5 cm) under the ground.
Be careful with any gates. If you don't join the fence to the walls of your house, it is important to ensure that any gate has no gaps on the sides and sits flush with the ground. It can help to place a concrete slab directly under the gate going into the ground as a deterrent - this must sit flush with the base of the gate. This is a time when precision building is very important.
Maintain the fence - all gaps, holes and dirt collapses must be dealt with quickly to prevent possible entry-points from weakening the fence.;
, Do not lean anything against the fence that a rattlesnake might be able to use as leverage to crawl over.

, Look for gaps, areas that a rattlesnake can access underneath the house and fill, plug or board off these areas. Under the house is an ideal environment for a snake, so take care to discourage this. Check the walls, the foundations, steps, etc.

, If you already have piles, be careful when removing them.

, Don't provide a tasty food source. Get rid of mice, rats and other rodents feasting about your home and you will remove a major source of rattlesnake attractant. This is especially important around areas where animal food is stored on farms.

, This means keeping pet food inside or covered. Garbage cans should be securely covered at all times.

, Potential homes for rattlesnakes should be removed from the area around your home. This includes such things as wood piles, rock piles, garbage piles, long grass, brush, undergrowth, piles of building materials, animal burrows, etc. Think about the places that would be cozy for a snake to move into and remove them. But be careful when you remove them! There may already be a rattlesnake in residence.

, A short lawn or field is not a great place to hide and makes it very easy for you to spot a rattlesnake taking a shortcut. Be careful, however, not to provide sheltering places such as piles of timber or rocks that create safety stations for snakes crossing short grass, or you will not succeed in discouraging them.

, Some snakes can be good to have around as they deter rattlesnakes from hanging about through natural competition. Of course, this depends on your own level of squeamishness about having any snakes at all in your backyard! If you don't mind the snakes, consider encouraging:



Gopher snakes (they get quite irritated with encroaching snakes on their territory)

Kingsnakes (they kill and eat rattlesnakes)

, If you do discover a rattlesnake in your backyard, keep calm. Send children, pets and scared adults indoors immediately. Wait for the snake to leave. Call for professional assistance if you are concerned that the rattlesnake may be settling in but if you have made your yard as unfavorable to a snake as possible, the snake will leave if given the chance. Most rattlesnakes will only strike if acting in self-defense. If you remain out of the way, there will be no strikes.

Spray water on the dog.",How to Protect Yourself from Dogs While Walking1," Depending on where you are walking, choose a way to protect yourself. You may choose to carry a large stick, a dog whistle, dog deterrent spray, or a stun gun.You can purchase commercial products that are proven to deter dog attacks.Look for a whistle that irritates dogs. You can blow the whistle and most dogs will run away from you. A traditional whistle can also work by startling the dog.In addition to the traditional stun gun, you can find stun batons that not only work on dogs but may frighten them away before you have to use it. The dog will see the baton and hear its electric charge, frightening it.;
, Don’t make eye contact because the dog could see it as a challenge.Instead, watch the dog in your peripheral vision.

, Baring teeth is a sign of aggression for dogs, so smiling or having your mouth open can signal to the dog that you are a threat. Instead, press your lips together to hide your teeth., While commands might not work as well for stray dogs, yelling a firm, one-word command can get a dog to back off. Try commands such as “Stop”, “No,” and “Back”. Don’t use a friendly voice when speaking to the dog, and avoid screaming or shrieking., Carry a spray bottle or a water bottle that has a nozzle. If you are approached by an aggressive dog, spraying it with water can get it to run off."

Keep in mind the rarity of serious stingray injuries.,
Look for guided tours in a small group.,
Ask about safety controls before you book the tour.,
Check reviews of the tour on an online review site.,
Do the stingray shuffle once you get in the water.,
Avoid touching or irritating the stingray’s tail.,
Remove the barb if you can see it on the surface of your skin.,
Head to the nearest medical clinic.",How to Swim With Stingrays," There have been only 17 stingray deaths recorded worldwide and it is rare to have a vital organ punctured by a stingray barb. The death of Steve Irwin, for example, is considered a tragedy in the naturist community partly because dying from a stingray barb is so uncommon. By nature, stingrays are docile, nocturnal creatures who do not attack humans. But they are easily frightened and disturbed if they are stepped on or startled by someone walking into the water, close to them.You can receive a minor injury from a stingray barb on your leg or toe if you accidentally step on a stingray’s tail or tread on a stingray that feels threatening to a stingray. Upon stepping on the stingray, the ray will respond by flipping its tail, which has a barb at the end, towards you. The barb may then come into contact with your foot, ankle, or toe.Depending on the severity of the barb injury, you may have excessive bleeding and require medical care or stitches once the venomous barb is removed.;
, When you book a swim with the stingrays excursion, look for a guided tour that allows no more than 10 people. This will ensure the tour guide can see everyone in the water and keep everyone safe while you swim with the stingrays.Many of these tours can be found in destinations on the coast of the Caribbean Sea, such as the Bahamas or the Cayman Islands. The tour guide will take you to an area known to have a high stingray population and allow you to wade around in waist deep water. These stingrays will likely act like captive animals, as they have become accustomed to human interaction. You may be given a snorkeling masks to look at the stingrays under the water and you will be allowed to touch the front area of the stingrays.You will also be given food that you can throw into the water to feed and attract the stingrays. Be cautious about over feeding the stingrays, as they can swarm around you and you may lose your footing. This could result in stepping on the tail of a stingray and getting a barb injury in your foot., A good tour guide will go over safety controls and precautions when you call to book the tour. Ask the guide about the precautions around avoiding stingray barbs and injuries due to the barbs. Most guides will instruct you to never touch the stingrays’ tails while in the water with them and to make calm, slow movements so you do not startle or scare the stingrays.

, Many tours are reviewed online on TripAdvisor.com, with detailed reviews discussing safety precautions on the tour, the quality of the tour guide, and the overall experience. Search the name of the tour online before you book it to read reviews and ensure there are no overwhelmingly negative reviews for the tour.

, Stingrays will often bury themselves in the sand in shallow water to protect themselves from predators. They may even change color to blend into the sand and disguise themselves. This makes it hard for predators to spot them, and for you to spot them as you walk into the shallow water. Avoid making contact with a stingray barb by shuffling your feet from side to side as you walk into the water. This will ensure you never step on a stingray and decrease your chances of getting stung.Though it may be hard to see stingrays in the shallow water if they are hiding in the sand, you should always watch where you step when entering the ocean. Look for wide, gray discs floating over the sand and try to step around them, rather than on them.
In the Caribbean, southern stingrays can grow to as wide as 6.5 feet, and in the Atlantic Ocean, Atlantic stingrays can grow to be as wide as 20 inches., Stingrays have long, whip like tails that contain one or more serrated, razor like barbs. They use their tails for defense against predators, like sharks, and will only flick their tails if they feel threatened or are disturbed in an aggressive way. When you are swimming with the stingrays, you should only touch the front area, or disc area of the rays. Do not place your hand too close to the stingray’s tail or on the stingray’s tail.You should also never swim directly over a stingray, as this could be seen as threatening, and when you are diving or snorkeling in an uncontrolled environment with wild stingrays, avoid going too close to them., If you get stung by a stingray during your tour and you can see the barb in the wound and it appears to be easy to remove, use sanitized tweezers to take it out. This will stop the transfer of the venom from the barb into your body.Avoid agitating the barb if it remains deep in the wound once you are stung. Removing it from a deep wound can result in blood lose and other medical issues. Instead, let a medical professional remove it in the hospital., The sting of a stingray is very painful and requires immediate medical attention to reduce the pain and clean the wound so it does not get infected. If you lose consciousness after you are stung, someone should call 911 right away as you may be in shock or have a drastic drop in your blood pressure. As well, if the barb breaks off in the wound and is embedded in the wound, it will need to be removed by a doctor at a hospital to prevent infection.Any stings to areas besides your legs and arms, such as your chest or abdomen, are considered serious, life threatening stings and should be treated at a hospital.
If you are stung while on a swim with the stingrays tour, inform the tour guide, who should stop the tour and take you to the nearest hospital or clinic. You should soak the affected area with hot water to help reduce the venom in the wound and allow the doctor at the hospital or clinic to treat the wound.If you are stung while in the ocean and there is a lifeguard on duty, signal to the lifeguard, who will help you out of the water and apply the necessary treatment. You should go to the hospital if the sting is severe or if the barb breaks off in the wound.

Remain standing.,
Aim for the face.,
Seek immediate help.,
Seek psychological help.",How to Survive a Lion Attack2," If these precautions don’t work for any reason, the lion may charge. If this happens, remain standing. The lion will likely go for your face and throat. This means that it will jump and you’ll have a full view of the giant cat. While this sounds terrifying, it will help to have a good view of the animal. If you were to crouch down, you would have much less of a chance to fight back if it attacked you at this angle., When the cat jumps at you, fight back. Punch or kick the lion as it leaps at you. Aim for the head and eyes as you continue to fight the predator off. The cat is likely to be much stronger than you but using hitting it in the head and eyes will have a great impact and could turn the lion off of you.

, Lion attacks have been fought off by humans before. The humans that were attacked and fought off the cats were able to seek immediate medical help. Especially if the lion was able to get its jaw on you and bite you, you need to stop the bleeding. Tend immediately to any deep gashes from its teeth or claws.

, Even if the attack was a mock attack, it may be a good idea to seek professional psychological help about it. Getting past such a traumatic experience is no easy feat. It’s a very rare situation to have been positioned in. Seeking help with aid you in moving on soon.

Stay away from mating lions.,
Stay away from cubs.,
Keep a night watch.",How to Survive a Lion Attack3," Mating lions and lionesses are extremely aggressive. They are easily triggered during this time. There is no specific time of year that lions reproduce. However, it is very easy to know when lions are mating because when the lioness is in the heat, the couples mate up to 40 times a day. This lasts for several days., No matter how tempting it may be or how cute lion cubs are, you should never interact with a lion cub. Lionesses are ferociously protective of their young and should therefore be given extra space. Do not attempt to interact with it in any way, shape or form. In the event you encounter cubs, try to find a route to take you as far from them as possible to avoid an attack.

, Lions are predominantly nocturnal. This is when they do a substantial amount of their hunting. If they’re in predator mode, they are much more prone to attack. If you’re in an area of high lion density overnight, maintain a night watch so that you aren’t caught off-guard."

Avoid running away.,
Bring your knee up.,
Cross your arms in front of your face.,
Roll into a ball.,
Ignore the dog.,
Avoid pulling away if the dog bites you.",How to Protect Yourself from Dogs While Walking2," If you run, the dog will instinctively try to catch you. It will see you as prey to chase down.Instead, you want to make yourself seem like you aren’t a threat and aren’t prey.

, Protect your torso and face by lifting your knee in front of your body. If the dog does bite or scratch, it won’t be able to reach your stomach, neck, or face., Larger breeds instinctively go for your face, so block them with your arms. Crossing your arms will put up a stronger barrier than just flailing your arms in front of your face.Further protect your head by tucking it under your arms. Lean your head forward and fold your crossed arms backward so that your head is covered.

, Since dogs have prey instinct, curling into a ball can end the dog’s urge to attack.While you may be afraid to lay on the ground, it’s the safest option during a dog attack. Just play dead.


Don’t move or try to scoot away. Just curl as tightly into a ball as you can.
Remove any items of clothing that may be around your neck since the dog may pull on it to play tug-of-war, which could strangle you.
Fight back only if the dog is small. Fighting back can make the dog fight harder, especially if it’s a larger breed that can overpower you., Don’t try to engage the dog at all while you’re on the ground. That means don’t look at the dog, don’t try to talk to it, and don’t try to sooth it by petting it. The dog is in attack mode, and engaging with it will only antagonize it more.


You can continue to shout commands if you’ve chosen to do so., The dog will only struggle to bite harder and hold on if you try to pull away.Additionally, you can rip the skin more and make your wound worse.

Choose safer places to walk.,
Cross the street if you see a fenced in dog.,
Be sure not to surprise a dog.",How to Protect Yourself from Dogs While Walking3," If you know that dogs frequent a particular area, choose another path for your walk. This is especially important if the dogs are strays as they are more likely to be hungry or territorial.


While it’s common for dogs to share walkways with people, think about how comfortable you are around dogs before you go to an area that is popular for dog walking. Dogs can sense emotions and will know if you’re uncomfortable, which could trigger a stressed dog.
Be on guard while walking on country roads. Unwanted dogs are often dumped in the country and left to fend for themselves, which leads to roaming dogs along country roads.
Always carry a big stick and other protective items such as a stun gun while walking alone on a country road.
If you are going on a walk to explore a new area, ask the locals about the likelihood of dog encounters. Dogs roam in packs in some countries or rural areas, so get information about how to stay safe before you go exploring.

, Dogs are very territorial and will aggressively defend their home. If you see a dog or know that a dog lives at a particular house, change up your route to avoid the dog. Large dogs can jump fences if they’re agitated., If you see a dog that is walking near you or is engaged in an activity nearby, don’t walk up on it. It’s best to quietly walk in the opposite direction. Surprising a dog can make even the gentlest dog act out aggressively because it’s afraid."
"
Ask the dog’s owner before you approach.,
Keep your hand flat with your fingers together.,
Wait for the dog to come to you.,
Watch the dog’s behavior.,
Give the dog a treat.",How to Protect Yourself from Dogs While Walking4," Some dogs aren’t ready to meet new people, so don’t assume that a dog that is out for its walk wants to be petted.The owner can also offer advice on how to best engage the dog if it is friendly.


Don’t run or move quickly toward a dog.
Never approach or pet a dog that is nursing her puppies.

, A flat hand will keep you safe and show the dog that you aren’t a threat.Extend your hand but don’t touch the dog until it’s ready.

, If the dog is open to you petting it, then it will come to you. Keep your hand extended so that the dog can smell you and decide if it wants you to pet it.If you are afraid, don’t reach out to the dog. Dogs can sense your emotions and might get scared.

, A friendly dog will perk his ears and lower his head. A dog that tilts his ears back, growls, or cowers does not want to be petted, so slowly back away. If the dog shows that it’s okay with you, gently pet it.


Pet the dog only on his head or upper back. Lightly pet the dog in his safe spots, avoiding his belly, tails, ears, and feet., If you know that there are a lot of dogs where you like to walk, consider carrying treats, such as a milk bone. Giving the dog a small treat can make you instant friends.Ask the dog’s owner before giving it a treat. The dog may be on a special diet or may have already had treats.

Stay out of shark-infested waters.,
Know your shark.,
Carry a weapon.,
Dress appropriately.,
Be vigilant.,
Move gracefully.,
Swim in a group.,
Recognize aggressive behavior.,
Stay out of the water at night and during dawn and dusk.,
Stay out of the water if bleeding.,
Avoid provoking sharks.,Don't urinate in the water.",How to Prevent a Shark Attack," The best way to avoid shark attacks is to stay out of water where sharks live. This of course means staying out of the ocean, but it also means staying out of estuaries and coastal rivers and lakes. The dangerous bull shark, in particular, can tolerate fresh water, and these large sharks are known to travel up rivers far inland. In fact, they have been spotted 2,500 miles (4,000 km) up the Amazon and as far up the Mississippi River as Illinois. If you can't avoid getting in the water altogether, at least try to avoid danger zones.


Heed warnings. Coastal areas where sharks have recently been sighted will often have posted warnings, and even in the absence of these, local people may be able to alert you to potential dangers. Stay out of the water if warned to do so.






Avoid steep drop-offs and the areas between sandbars. These are among sharks' favorite haunts.






Avoid waters contaminated with effluents or sewage. Sharks are drawn to these areas. Of course, that's not the only reason to avoid polluted water.






Avoid swimming near fishing activity. Sharks may come in for a snack off fishermen nets or lines, and they may be attracted by bait or by discarded fish. Even in the absence of fishing boats, if you see seabirds swooping down to the water, there's a good chance there's fishing activity or feeding going on.





;
, There are more than 300 species of sharks, but very few of these are considered dangerous to humans. In fact, three species--the white, tiger, and bull sharks--are responsible for the vast majority of human fatalities. These sharks are widely distributed in coastal waters throughout the world, and if you see them or know they are present you should exit the water as soon as safely possible. The oceanic white-tip shark is more common in the open ocean and can also be aggressive. Find out what kinds of sharks may be present where you will be entering the water, but keep in mind that any shark over 6 feet (1.8 m) in length should be considered potentially dangerous.

, If you're diving in waters where you're likely to encounter sharks, carry a spear-gun or pole-spear. By no means should you provoke an attack or lull yourself into a false sense of security with these weapons, but if you are attacked they may save your life.

, Stick to dull swimwear and wetsuits, as bright or flashy colors with high contrast can attract sharks. Avoid wearing jewelry, as the reflection of light off such accessories is similar to the reflection of light off a fish's scales, and it can thus make you look like food. Cover your diving watch with the cuff of your wetsuit. Similarly, avoid or cover uneven tanning, as the contrast makes you more visible to shark. The bright yellows and oranges typical of life jackets and flotation devices can be attractive to sharks, but if you're in the open ocean you need to consider that these colors also make you more visible to rescuers.

, You may encounter any number of hazards when diving, surfing, or swimming in the ocean or coastal rivers, and you should always be wary. Proceed with caution in whatever you do, and be aware of your environment. If you spot a shark, don't let it out of your sight until you're safely on shore or in the boat.

, Avoid splashing on the surface of the water, and try to swim smoothly at all times. Avoid sudden or erratic movements when in the presence of sharks, as these may draw attention to you and, worse yet, give you the appearance of being wounded. If you see a shark nearby while you're diving, stay as still as possible to avoid attracting its attention or threatening it.

, Regardless of the danger of sharks, you should avoid swimming alone. If sharks are present, however, it's even more important to travel with a buddy or a group. Sharks are less likely to approach and attack a group of people, and if one member of the group is attacked, help is immediately available. When diving in the presence of sharks, one member of the group should be charged solely with watching the sharks and detecting changes in their behavior.

, Sharks swimming slowly and smoothly are generally not a threat. They may approach divers but are generally just curious when they do so. If a shark begins making sudden movements, swimming quickly or erratically, or if it shows signs of aggression or irritation--pointing its pectoral fins down, arching its back, pointing its head upward, zig-zagging, or charging--it may be considering an attack. Swim quickly and smoothly to safety, either out of the water or to a defensible location, and prepare to defend yourself.

, Sharks hunt most actively at these times, and they're harder for you to see in dark conditions. Also in shark-prone areas try to avoid overcast days, as it approximates the light levels at dawn and dusk's feeding times.

, If you have an open wound. Women need not be concerned if they are experiencing menstrual bleeding. Tampons remedy this, and without one the amount of blood released in a 30-45 minute dive would be exceptionally minuscule. , A little less than half of documented shark attacks result from provocation or harassment of sharks, particularly by divers. Use common sense, and give sharks plenty of space. Do not attempt to catch or prod sharks. Don't corner them, and don't try to get close to them to photograph them. But, if you have to get close, be sure to carry a weapon. (Look at earlier paragraph.)

Gauge the dog's demeanor.,
Do not be mislead by breed stereotypes.,
Most dogs, big and small, are not aggressive and are likely to be afraid of you.,
For scared dogs, back away slowly until the dog is at ease.,
For an aggressive dog, the first priority should be to protect yourself.,
If there is nothing that can safely remove you from an aggressive dog, you should use your arm to deflect or absorb any bites.,
Very few dogs will actually bite a human being, if unprovoked.",How to Protect Yourself from a Stray Dog," Is it aggressive or afraid? Signs of aggression include: baring teeth, lifted tail, raised ears and hackles (the fur behind the neck, in many large breeds the hackles are very easy to see when they are lifted). Signs of fear include tucking the tail, laid back ears and also snarling or barking. Barking is a sure sign that the dog doesn't want you any closer than you already are.;
, Look for body language to understand what the dog is trying to convey. A dog's behavior is determined more by its training (or lack thereof) than its genetics.

, The most common situation is that a dog is lost, scared, and doesn't trust you. Even if they look frightening, their first instinct will be to repel you and get away.

, Do not try to command them. Note your location and, if the dog is unknown to you, call animal control immediately. If you know who the dog belongs to, of course, call them first!

, Do not run, as the dog will catch you and will be encouraged to bite. Many dogs instinctively know how to ""take down"" a runner, and the last place you want to be is on the ground. Search for something to climb onto and call for help.

, Do not aggravate an aggressive dog by shouting at it or staring into its eyes. Eye contact is aggressive and will likely spur an attack.

, Stay calm and try to keep your stance tall and confident. Walk away, if you aren't being chased, and call animal control at the first opportunity. Dogs are pack animals. When they are alone, they are not usually looking for confrontation.

Provide your cat with a heartworm prevention product.,
Use a picaridin product designed for cats.,
Avoid using bug spray products not approved for cats.",How to Protect Your Cat from Mosquito Bites1," Perhaps the most common risk for cats associated with mosquito bites are heartworms. Heartworms are transmitted through mosquito bites and can destroy your cat’s cardiovascular system and cut their lifespan short.Heartworm prevention is typically administered to dogs and cats monthly.
Heartworm prevention can be given to your cat orally.
Popular heartworm prevention brands include Heartgard, Tri-Heart, and Frontline.;
, Out of the many popular mosquito repellants, picaridin has been shown to be safe for cats. As a result, when looking for a repellant product, you may want to choose a picaridin product that is formulated for cats.Consult your vet before using a specific product.
Picaridin products may come in spray or lotion form.

, Many human (and dog) products are not safe for cats. If you give your cat certain products, you may poison or even kill it.

Don’t give your cat any products with DEET.
Permethrin products can kill cats. This is one of the most common ways that cats throughout the world are poisoned.Check with your vet before using any repellant on your cat.

Steer clear of shady, wooded areas.,
Give piles of leaves a wide berth.,
Stay away from high grasses.,
Seek out sunny areas.,
Walk in the center of trails and clearings.,
Check with park staff.,
Protect your pet from ticks.",How to Prevent Tick Bites While Camping1," Ticks like moist and shady environments, so dark, wooded locations are ideal places for them to live. Avoiding these spaces will reduce your risk of exposure.Ticks can easily dry out, so the woods provide them with protection from sun and wind.
Ticks do not drop on you from trees, but they often attach at ground level and crawl upwards.;
, Ticks like to hide in piles of decomposing or rotting leaves, because these environments are humid and dark. As a result, it’s a good idea to avoid standing or sitting in these places.Don’t pitch your tent or set up camp in a location with leaf litter.
Make sure you bring camp chairs so you can avoid sitting on the ground.

, Try not to walk in areas with high grass or vegetation, because ticks often rest on grasses, waiting for a host (an animal or human) to walk past or brush against the grass so they can attach.Ticks hang on to the grass with their hind legs while holding front legs out so they can more easily attach to a new host.
Experts call this behavior “questing.”

, Ticks prefer shade and moisture, so remaining in sunny areas will reduce the risk of tick exposure.Ticks, especially the younger nymphs, can’t survive long in areas with low humidity because they dry out.
To decrease the risk of tick bites, choose a camping spot in a dry, sunny location.

, Staying on the path and in cleared areas will help keep you away from ticks.Cleared areas do not have the shade, humidity, and vegetation that ticks prefer.
Parks and other campgrounds are also more likely to spray in these areas to eliminate ticks.
Going off trails and outside of designated areas increases the risk of tick bites.

, If you are camping in a state park or official recreation area, check in with staff to ask about the best place to camp to avoid ticks.


It’s easier to call in advance so you can plan accordingly.
Park websites often post announcements and alerts about ticks, so do some research before you arrive.

, Animals are very susceptible to tick bites and tick-borne illnesses. Ticks can also attach themselves to your pets before moving on to human hosts. If you take your pets with you camping, make sure to keep them on a leash and away from areas where ticks are likely to be found.
Ticks can be difficult to detect on pets, so check regularly and thoroughly when outdoors.
Talk with your veterinarian about tick prevention for your pet before going on a camping trip.
There are many different tick-prevention options for pets such as creams, collars, and pills.

Avoid letting your cat out at certain times of the day.,
Limit time out during the summer or rainy season.,
Turn your cat into an indoor cat.",How to Protect Your Cat from Mosquito Bites2," While mosquitos are active throughout the day, there are certain times that are a lot worse than others. Mosquitos are especially bad at:

Dawn
Dusk
Nighttime, Just as certain parts of the day are worse than others, so are certain parts of the year. As a result, you should consider limiting your cat’s outdoor time during certain parts of the year.Don’t let your cat out during the rainy season. If it rains daily or several times a week, you’ll likely have a much larger population of mosquitos around your home.
Keep your cat in when daily highs begin to move above 55 to 65 degrees Fahrenheit (13 to 18 degrees Celsius).

, If you are really concerned about the risk of mosquito bites, you might consider turning your cat into an indoor cat. By keeping your cat indoors, you’ll dramatically decrease the risk of mosquito bites and mosquito-borne illnesses.If your cat is used to playing outside, you may need to provide plenty of new toys so it will have something to do inside.
If your cat has been an outdoor cat for many years, it might be very hard to successfully transition it to a life inside. You will need to judge for yourself how your cat reacts to their new life.

Ask your vet if there are any steps you can take to protect your cat.,
Keep annual and semiannual appointments.,
Talk to your vet about mosquito bite hypersensitivity.",How to Protect Your Cat from Mosquito Bites3," As a specialist, your vet likely has insight into ways you can protect your cat from mosquito bites. Thus, you should initiate a conversation with your vet about it.

Tell your vet you are concerned about mosquito bites and mosquito-borne diseases. For instance, say “Yoda spends a lot of time outside, and our yard is fairly wet. I’m concerned he’s getting bit by mosquitos.”
Ask your vet’s advice about what you can do to limit the chance of your cat getting bitten by mosquitos. For example, say “Is there anything I can do so Yoda doesn’t get bitten all the time?”

, Despite all the steps you take to protect your cat, it may be impossible to eliminate the risk of mosquito bites. As a result, you need to keep annual and semiannual appointments so your vet can evaluate your cat’s health.

Your vet will physically examine your cat. If mosquito bites present an issue, they may be able to observe this.
Your vet will run blood work on your cat so they can have a better idea of if your cat suffers from mosquito-borne disease (or other health problems).

, A minority of cats have mosquito bite hypersensitivity. This is a condition in which the cat’s immune system will have a substantial reaction to a bite. It could cause severe skin issues and possibly lead to a dangerous allergic reaction.Your cat may have mosquito bite hypersensitivity if it develops red, inflamed, lesions around the site of a bite.
Your vet may take a biopsy of the affected area of skin.
Your vet will ask you to confine the cat indoors for up to a week to see if the skin lesions disappear.
Your vet may treat mosquito bite hypersensitivity with corticosteroids.

Choose long-sleeved shirts and pants.,
Wear a hat.,
Secure long hair.,
Select light-colored clothing.,
Invest in clothing treated to repel ticks.",How to Prevent Tick Bites While Camping2," Although ticks can crawl under clothes easily, you reduce the risk of tick bites by covering more skin and making it harder for ticks to attach themselves to the skin.Tuck your pants into your socks and tuck your shirt into your pants to keep ticks from getting inside your clothes.
For extra protection, wrap masking tape around where the pant leg cuffs are tucked into your socks to keep them secure from ticks, which are usually at ground level.

, Cover your head with a hat or kerchief to provide additional protection from ticks.Ticks do not drop on you from trees, but they can crawl very effectively.They like to attach around your head or ears because the skin is thinner in these locations and hosts often have trouble reaching or grooming these areas., If you have long hair, it’s a good idea to cover, braid, or tie it so that it is secure and you don’t brush against areas where ticks might be located.You don’t want to give ticks anything else to crawl on.
This also makes it easier to check for ticks.

, Ticks are easier to spot when they land on light colors.Nymphal ticks, or baby ticks, can be as small as a poppy seed, and the lighter your clothes, the easier time you will have locating the tick.
Although you should wear pants and long sleeves to prevent tick exposure, wearing lighter-colored clothing will help you stay cool when it’s warm outside.

, One of the most effective ways to prevent tick bites is to purchase clothes that have already been treated with permethrin, an effective tick repellent that kills ticks on contact.The repellent is odorless and invisible.
Clothing that has been commercially treated is effective after up to 70 washings.
If you are concerned about the risks of applying sprays and chemicals directly to your skin, this is a good alternative option.
You can also purchase permethrin kits to treat your clothes at home, but these applications are not usually as long lasting.
Tick-repellent clothing and kits to treat clothing can be found in sporting goods stores and are also available online from a number of retailers.

Locate an effective repellent.,
Follow the product instructions.,
Don’t forget to apply repellent to your shoes.,
Treat clothes and fabrics with products that contain permethrin.,
Research and try natural tick repellents.,
Don’t treat your pets with the same repellent you use.",How to Prevent Tick Bites While Camping3," Do not assume that an insect repellent works against ticks. Make sure you read the label to verify the product is effective at repelling ticks.Effective tick-prevention products that you apply to the skin generally contain DEET.
The CDC recommends repellents that contain 20% or more of DEET.

, These repellents contain potentially dangerous chemicals and should be applied carefully, making sure to follow the product’s specific instructions.Avoid the hands, eyes, and mouth.
It’s a good idea to talk with your child’s pediatrician or a medical professional about the safety of using these products on children.
If you are pregnant, check with your doctor about whether it is safe to use this product.
Reapply the product every few hours or as instructed.
Wash the repellent off when you go indoors.

, Ticks are often located at the ground level, and spraying your shoes with repellent will greatly reduce your risk of tick exposure.Think of this as one of the first lines of defense to prevent tick bites.

, Permethrin has been shown to be highly effective at repelling and killing ticks, but it should not be applied directly to the skin. Instead, you apply the product to clothing and it offers protection through multiple washings.You can find repellents with permethrin at sporting goods, camping stores, and online.
Read and follow product instructions.
Don’t forget to apply the repellent to the inside of your clothes to prevent tick bites if ticks crawl under clothing.
If you would rather not apply the product yourself, you can research and purchase clothing that has already been treated.
Clothing that has been commercially treated with permethrin, usually offers longer-lasting protection through more washes.

, If you have concerns about the potential health risks of applying chemicals directly to your skin or on your clothing, try researching and testing natural tick repellents.There are many different products you can purchase or recipes that you can make at home that claim to repel ticks.Many of these products and recipes contain essential oils such as lavender, rose, geranium, and cedarwood.
As with any product, read and follow the instructions carefully.
It’s better to be cautious and talk with your doctor and/or veterinarian before applying natural or homemade products to your children or pets.

, Repellents that are safe for you are not necessarily safe for your pets. Make sure you apply a product that says it is safe to apply to pets.It’s best to talk with your veterinarian about the right tick-preventative for your pet.
Products are available in many different forms such as creams, collars, or pills.
Many pet stores carry products to repel ticks, but veterinarians can make sure you know how much to use and offer tips on application.

Check yourself and your animals/companions for ticks every 2 to 3 hours.,
Shower as soon as you can.,
Run your clothes through the dryer as soon as you return home.,
Remove any ticks you find on your clothing.,
Extract attached ticks.,
Send the tick for testing.",How to Prevent Tick Bites While Camping4," A tick must bite a person or pet to transmit disease, so by checking yourself constantly during your camping trip, the chances of contracting a tick disease are significantly reduced. When you check for ticks make sure to look in these places:Under arms and on the backs of knees
Inside your belly button
Around your waist
Between your legs
In and around your ears
A hand-held or full-body mirror can make checking for ticks easier.

, Although it can be difficult while camping, taking a shower or bathing will help you locate and remove any unattached ticks.This is a good time to perform a tick check.

, To kill ticks that might be on your clothes, dry clothing as soon as you come home from your camping trip.


Dry the clothes on high heat for 10-15 minutes.Do this before washing the clothes, since research has shown ticks are not killed by washing (even in hot water).
Don’t leave your clothing sitting in a pile or stick it in a hamper.

, To remove ticks that aren't attached, place duct tape over them and pull them off the skin or clothing with the tape. Then, fold the tape over itself and toss it in the trash.Bring a roll of duct tape on your trip so you are prepared.
A lint roller also works well for removing unattached ticks.

, If the tick has already attached itself to your skin, use tweezers to grab its body and pull it directly up and away.Tweezers with pointed ends work best so you can grab and hold on to the tick more easily.
If the tweezers are not pointed, you can tear the tick during removal, which increases the risk of spreading disease.
Never twist the tick or try to coax it off using heat or solvents.
Follow up by swabbing the area with rubbing alcohol to disinfect.
You can also apply an antibiotic cream or ointment to the site of the tick bite.

, If you are concerned about the risks of tick bites or live in an area where tick-borne diseases are common, it’s a good idea to place the tick you remove in a plastic bag so you can identify the type of tick and send it in for disease testing.Note the date you removed the tick on the bag.
Contact your local health department about where to send the tick for testing and for help with identification.

Learn about snakes that are native to the area.,
Avoid areas where there is tall grass and brush.,
Resist sticking a hand or foot into a crevasse or hole.,
Remember that snakes can climb trees.,
Dress in protective clothing when you are out in the wilderness.,
Avoid making camp in potential snake habitats.,
Be cautious when swimming, wading or fishing in lakes or rivers, especially after heavy rains.",How to Prevent Snake Bites1," Whether you are visiting a new location, or staying in your own backyard, you should familiarize yourself with the snakes native to your area. It is important to learn both the venomous and non-venomous snakes that live near you, and how to distinguish the two.Before you head out on an outdoor adventure in a new area, learn about the snakes that are native there.


Again, while you certainly want to avoid all snake bites, you'll want to understand the differences and urgency levels in treating both kinds of bites, venomous and non-venomous.
Some snakes, like the coral snake and the king snake, look very similar. While they both reside in similar areas, only the coral snake is venomous. It is important to be able to distinguish between similar looking snakes, especially when one is venomous.;
, Try to stay on trails or clear areas where you can see where you step. If you must go into tall grass or brush, use a long stick to probe the area before stepping into it. Snakes use natural coverage, like tall grass and weeds, to protect themselves from predators, to avoid extreme temperature and to hunt for prey. Trails have fewer hiding spots for snakes, so it is better to stay on clearly marked paths., Snakes often curl up in dark places like holes in fallen timber or in hidden spots among boulders. Look carefully before you step or place your hand anywhere. This is especially true when rock climbing or exploring in caves. If you come across a crevasse, it’s best to leave it be. If you do need to poke around, use a long stick to prod into the area to make sure it is empty.


Snakes do not dig holes, but they do use holes dug by other animals to hide. So what looks like a hole dug by a chipmunk or mole may really contain a snake., Be careful while walking under low hanging branches, or when climbing up a tree as you could easily mistake a snake for a branch. Snakes can slither up trees and can hang down to be head height. It’s best to keep your wits about you at all times, and remember that snakes can be hiding out nearly anywhere.

, Wear heavy boots and long pants.Never go barefoot or wear sandals in areas where you are unable to clearly see where you’re putting your feet.


When you are walking through grassy areas, you should wear closed toe shoes to prevent bites. Thick materials, like leather, are less likely to be punctured by a snake’s fangs than a thinner material, like canvas.Loose fitting long pants are better than tight fitting pants. This way, in the event that you are bitten, there is less of a chance that the snake’s fangs will reach your skin., Don't camp near large logs, rocky areas or tall grass. Many snakes are nocturnal so you will want to be especially careful at night. Zip your tent up tightly and sleep on a cot when possible, since you are less likely to be bitten on a raised surface. Use a flashlight to check inside shoes and the floor of the tent before you venture out at night to use the latrine or portable toilet.


Shake out clothing, shoes, and sleeping bags before use to dislodge any hidden snakes., Water snakes are venomous and you could be in dire need of help very quickly if bitten.Depending on you area, there may or may not be water snakes. After heavy rains, snakes are more likely to be in water due to flooding in their habitat. Heavy rains also drive snakes into the open since their favorite hiding spots may be flooded.Avoid swimming in muddy waters, or waters with vegetation since these are favorite hiding areas for water snakes."

Try to bring foods with low sugar content in an area were you think there may be bees. Cola and other types of sugar-syrup drinks will attract bees. If you're not sure whether the drink you have is alright, stick to water.;
, Some scents will attract bees and force you into contact with them.

, The more you're covered, the less able they are to sting you. Saturated colors have less of a chance of attracting them.

, Some types of bees burrow in the ground rather than the trees. When vibrations occur near the nesting, they can be disturbed and attack the most nearby animal, or come straight up and sting the soles of your feet.

, Use precautions when mowing or removing vegetation or doing any type of yard work. If you find any nests, have them removed by a professional.

, Old cans, leftovers, or any type of garbage will most likely attract bees. If you're able to, remove the objects away from where you'll be.

, Do not try to swat or hit the bees or it may lead to being stung. If you're stung anyway, cover your nose and mouth and leave the area. When a bee has stung, it releases a chemical to attract more bees to the area. Evacuate to a closed structure like a car or building.

, Set aside your fantasies about getting close to a cute and loveable monkey. Sure, it’s possible to cultivate a relationship with monkeys over a long period of time. And some monkeys are tamer than others. But you must always remember that, no matter what, monkeys are wild animals. Keeping your distance is important step in preventing a monkey attack. Remember:


Monkeys have up to four times the strength of a human being.
Monkeys are unpredictable.
Monkey bites are dangerous due to the high levels of bacteria in their mouths.
Monkeys are common carriers of rabies.

, It’s almost always a bad idea to have food in the vicinity of a monkey, as food is one of the most common reasons a monkey will attack. This applies to food you’ve kept hidden in a container, too. Monkeys have an amazing sense of smell and can even detect food that’s still in its packaging. Plus, giving food to one monkey will likely attract others, which may interpret your refusal to feed them as a sign of aggression and be a reason for them to attack. It may seem like innocent fun and other people may be doing it, but please: do not feed the monkeys.

, Avoid smiling at monkeys or making any sort of gesture that shows or bares your teeth. To a monkey, a big toothy grin is a sign of threat and aggression. Don't yell at, sing to, tease or heckle the monkey. Avoid any postures that would seem aggressive to a fellow human being and keep your motions minimal. Being aggressive will only get you attacked.

, You’ve found the coolest location, the light is right, and there are tons of cute monkeys just waiting to be photographed. But be careful. Monkeys have been known to attack selfie-takers because they sometimes interpret their own reflection in the camera lens as a strange and potentially dangerous monkey. Focusing on your camera and not on the situation around you can be dangerous because it means you’re not considering important signs that may affect whether a monkey is about to attack.

, Always pay close attention to a monkey’s body language. There are some behaviors you should become familiar with. For example, a monkey is telling you it feels threatened and might behave in an aggressive manner if it blinks, makes an exaggerated yawn or gives you a big smile. When a monkey bares its teeth it is almost always a sign of aggression. , If a monkey is acting especially aggressive, don’t run away or show your fear. The pecking order in monkey clans is well-established and running away will tell the monkey that you are subordinate to them and will increase their aggressive instincts. Instead, back away slowly while still facing the monkey and avoiding direct eye contact.

, Most acts of monkey aggression are a result of a monkey thinking you have food. If you do have food, throw it in their direction. If you don’t, simply hold out your empty palms to show the monkey you have none. , Many people who study monkeys have been attacked by them – but have never been bitten. The secret is to avoid panicking if an aggressive monkey comes at you and jumps on you. The monkey is most likely only asserting itself and is not looking for actual combat.


Contain your fear as best as possible.
Don’t scream.
Don’t try to fight the monkey or push it off.
Walk calmly away. The monkey will eventually let go and leave you alone. , Never refuse to drop something that a monkey has grabbed hold of. Monkeys are very curious creatures but they also have shorter attentions spans than we do, so the chances are they’ll drop whatever it is they’ve grabbed within a short amount of time. Anything with straps, like your camera or backpack are tempting for monkeys and many people have been attacked because they refuse to let the monkey examine it. , A monkey bite, no matter how small it may seem, is no laughing matter. Monkeys are known carriers of rabies but even a bite from a healthy monkey can cause a life-threatening infection due to the bacteria in their mouths. Retreat to a safe place.
Scrub your wound with clean water and soap to make sure as many germs as possible have been removed.
Visit a doctor as soon as you can. They will likely suggest a course of antibiotics and may even suggest antibiotics against rabies, which has no initial symptoms and is fatal if not treated immediately. "

Keep your yard and adjacent property mowed.,
Educate children about snakes.,
Use care when handling stored yard materials.,
Take precautions if you own a snake to avoid being bitten.,
Use extreme caution if you ever have to approach a snake.",How to Prevent Snake Bites2," Trim hedges and clear brush to discourage snakes from taking up residence near your home. Just like in the wilderness, snakes use tall grass and brush to hide. By keeping your grass short, you can lessen the possibility that a snake will be hiding in your yard.

, Children must be taught that snakes can be dangerous and that they should be avoided. If you have children in the home, educate them about the different types of snakes that live in your area and the danger that they can pose. Discourage them from ever trying to play with or catch a snake.Keep your children from playing in areas where snakes could be hiding. Discourage them from going to nearby vacant lots where there is high grass and brush.

, Use an implement when gathering firewood from an outdoor stack or when working with brush or lumber. Wear boots and gloves to protect yourself as well. Snakes like to hide in cool and dark areas for shelter, like firewood stacks and near sheds. Before you reach your hands into these areas, use a long stick to prod around. This will alert any snakes hiding inside that you are present, and they will likely try to escape rather than confront you.Use extreme care in the summer during drought conditions. Snakes will seek water around your garden hose, swimming pool, or under your air conditioning unit.

, If you happen to have a pet snake, you will need to be a responsible owner. While it is unlikely that you have a venomous snake as a pet, you still want to avoid being bitten. Use a snake hook to handle your snake rather than using your hands. The majority of bites occur during feeding time, so it is important to be extra cautious during this process.


Choose a docile snake as a pet. Corn snakes and ball pythons have reputations as snakes that are reluctant to bite.
Don't handle your snake after having touched prey, such as mice, while the scent is still on your hands.

, This is also the case if you think the snake is dead. Recently killed snakes still can move reflexively and even bite. Also a snake may look dead, but simply be lying very still as it suns itself. Never try to handle a snake or handle it. Many experts suggest that you avoid trying to kill the snake as well. If you see a snake that you recognize as poisonous on your property, note the location and call an animal control officer. Keep children and pets out of the area until the officer can come and try to remove the snake, if it is still in the area.The majority of snakes will try to flee the area and avoid contact if you ever happen upon them or their habitat. If you ever come into contact with a snake, back away slowly and avoid making sudden movements and loud noises. The snake can perceive these as threats and may be more inclined to bite when it feels threatened.

Take note of the spider’s length.,
Look at the spider’s body.,
Watch the spider’s jaws move.,
Look for gender differences.,
Expect variations.,
Know where trapdoor spiders are found throughout the world.,
Look for areas where trapdoor spiders like to burrow.,
Recognize the signs of a trapdoor spider burrow.,
Look for trapdoor spider food.",How to Identify a Trapdoor Spider," Trapdoor spiders are approximately 0.79 in to 1.26 inches (1 to 3 cm) long.That means roughly between the size of your pinky nail and your thumbnail.;
, Trapdoor spiders are black or brown, with stout bodies and legs. Some species have paler color markings, or they may have a silky covering of hair. Their bodies are divided into two sections: the thorax (containing the head and legs) and the abdomen.The abdomen is typically lighter and a slightly different color.


Though they may be difficult to see because of its small size, a trapdoor spider will have 6 eyes arranged in 3 groups, whereas most other spiders have 8 eyes.Trapdoor spiders are relatives of tarantulas, but are less hairy, and have smaller, shinier bodies., The jaws of a trapdoor spider are attached to the front of its head. They move up and down, unlike most other spiders, whose jaws move side to side., Females trapdoor spiders are larger than the males, but you will seldom see females because they rarely leave their burrows.Therefore, if you see a trapdoor spider, it is most likely a male. Look for these characteristics that identify male trapdoor spiders:


Short and blunt spinnerets. These produce silk, and are located at the tip of the abdomen.A double spur about halfway along their front legs.
A dusty or dull carapace (a harder area covering much of the thorax) that is lightly covered in bristles.Pedipalps (small appendages near the jaws) that resemble boxing gloves.

, There are numerous varieties of trapdoor spiders, each with slightly different physical characteristics.More varieties of trapdoor spiders are still being discovered. If you think you have seen a trapdoor spider, look up the specific varieties that live in your area, so that you know can what kind of specific markings to expect.

, The geographic distribution of trapdoor spiders is erratic and is attributed to the continental drift. Various species of trapdoor spiders can be found all over the world. Look for trapdoor spiders in:North America: Canada, The United States (southeastern and pacific states, and north to Colorado)
Central America (Guatemala, Mexico, etc.)
Asia (China, Japan, Thailand, etc.)
South Africa and Madagascar
Australia

, Throughout the world, trapdoor spiders favor warm environments, such as temperate forests and deserts. They will burrow in grassy areas, hillsides, and dirt embankments., Trapdoor spiders burrow in the ground (about 0.75 inches wide and up to 8 inches deep) and cover their burrow with a silken hinged “trapdoor” camouflaged by sticks, pebbles, and other natural material.Because the burrows are camouflaged, they can be very hard to see.


Larger burrows may have multiple trapdoors.
Usually, the burrow faces sunlight and will be found near vegetation.

, Trapdoor spiders are shy, may be nocturnal, and are rarely seen far from their burrows (males may wander during mating season, however).You might be able to spy one, however, when it eats. The spiders will wait in their burrows until they sense vibrations in the ground caused by insects (including crickets, moths, beetles, and grasshoppers) and other spiders. Then, the spiders will leap out of the trapdoor, grab one of these animals, and drag it back into the burrow.

Try to detach the leech’s suckers.,
Wait for the leech to fall off.,
Stop any bleeding.,
Clean the wound to prevent infection.,
Do not try to simply rip the leech off.,
Do not try to burn or poison the leech to cause it to detach.,
See a doctor if necessary.",How to Kill Leeches1," Locate the leech’s oral sucker on the anterior (thinner end). Place your finger or fingernail on the skin next to this, and gently slide it underneath. Push to the side to detach the leech.Repeat this step at the posterior end sucker, then flick the leech off of your body.


Push the leech away as you detach it, because it will try to reattach itself to your body.
Make sure to start with the thinner, anterior end, which is actually the leech’s “head.”Dispose of the leech away from the water after you have detached it. You can pour salt on the leech to ensure it is killed, but do this only after you have safely removed it.;
, Once the leech has had enough blood, it should fall off on its own, typically after about twenty minutes.If you cannot remove the leech safely, you may have to leave it and wait until it stops feeding. While this can be unsettling, the leech should not cause you any pain or serious injury.


Dispose of the leech after it falls off. You can pour salt on the leech to ensure it is killed, but do this only after it detaches itself from your body.

, Leeches have anticoagulant enzymes that cause blood to flow freely.If the bite area continues to bleed after you remove the leech (or after it falls off), apply gentle pressure with a clean cloth or gauze until the bleeding stops.

, Leeches can leave a small wound where they were attached to your body.Clean this wound using warm water and a mild soap. Afterwards, apply an over-the-counter antibacterial cream and bandage. In the event that the wound becomes infected, see a doctor.

, Leeches are very flexible and difficult to grasp, and even if you are successful at grabbing one and pulling it off your body, this may make things worse. In ripping it away, parts of the leech’s jaws may remain in your body, which can cause an infection., Many traditional remedies for removing leeches involve putting a match or flame to the leech’s body, or pouring salt, alcohol, vinegar, or other things on the leech. While this will likely cause the leech to detach itself from your body, it may regurgitate the contents of its stomach back into the bite wound as it detaches. This can cause an infection., If leeches are attached to sensitive areas, such as on your eye, or in an orifice such as your nasal cavity, vagina, or penis, you should see a doctor for professional help. Doctors are trained in the use of special techniques and equipment to remove leeches, and will be able to treat any infections or complications that arise.You should also see a doctor if, after removing a leech on your own, you notice signs of infection, irritation, or other unusual symptoms.
Signs of infection can include redness, swelling, or pus at the site of the wound, as well as general pain and fever.

Set a trap.,
Attract ducks to the leech-infested area.Ducks may feed on leeches, which can help to keep their populations low.,
Maintain populations of bluegill and largemouth bass fish.,
Control aquatic vegetation and debris.,
Use chemical control methods.",How to Kill Leeches2," Take a metal can with a reclosable lid, such as a large coffee can, and punch small holes in this lid.Put raw meat inside the can, close the lid, and tie a string around the can. Place this in shallow parts of water where you suspect leeches live, and they will be attracted to and enter the can. You can then pull the can out of the water and dispose of the leeches.


Leeches are most active during warm months. Lay your trap, check it daily during warm periods, and dispose of any caught leeches. Repeat this until few or no leeches appear in the trap.The exact size of the holes you should punch in the can lid will depend on the species of leech. If no leeches are being caught in your trap, try a larger or smaller hole size until it works.

, If you attract ducks using duck feed, however, this can increase levels of phosphorus in water and contribute to algae growth. Species of duck known to consume leeches include:


Ring-necked duck (Aythya collars)Wood duck (Aix sponsa)Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata)

, These fish are natural predators of leeches and will help to control their population.This method will only work for enclosed, private waters like ponds.

, An overabundance of vegetation and organic debris in ponds and lakes is thought to contribute to the growth of leech populations. If possible, keep vegetation to about ten percent of a pond’s surface area.Remove or control any excess vegetation to help combat leech infestation. Methods include:Minimizing the feeding of fish and ducks. Their waste provides nutrients that increase the growth of aquatic vegetation.
Manually removing vegetation from the water. It is best to remove the whole plant, roots and all. Make sure to discard the plants out of the water so that the debris does not nourish future plant growth.
Dredging or deepening the body of water. The greater depth will make it harder for plants to root.
Lowering the water level. Shallower water during cold and freezing times will make it more difficult for plants to establish.
Lining the bottom of the body of water. Plastic sheeting or mineral layers at the bottom of the water can discourage aquatic vegetation.
Introducing herbivores. A wide variety of ducks, geese, turtles, insects, snails, crayfish, and fish will eat aquatic vegetation and therefore reduce its growth. The Chinese grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) is thought to be a particularly good choice for this method.
Using aquatic herbicides. Common choices include: Chelated Copper Compounds, Fluridone (Sonar), 2,4-D, Glyphosate (Rodeo, Pondmaster), Diquat, and Endothall (Aquathol, Hydrothol). These may have a range of side effects, including fish kills. They may also need to be applied over and over again, because the vegetation that is killed decomposes in the water and contributes to future vegetation growth.
Carefully follow all directions provided with herbicides, and contact your local county extension agent before introducing any species that may be considered invasive.

, Copper sulfate pentahydrate is used to control leech populations. The recommended dose is 5 ppm.This approach, however, will kill everything in the water, including fish and other creatures. Thus, this method should be used only in enclosed, fish-less waters.


Copper sulfate pentahydrate is toxic and must be handled properly. Follow all safety and usage guidelines provided with the product."

Plan ahead.,
Develop the plan.,
Know what to do to avoid an encounter.,
Respond to an encounter.,
Know how to respond to a crouching, staring and/or creeping cougar.,
Know what to do if a cougar attacks a child.,
Leave the area after an attack.,
Remember something very, very important.",How to Prepare Kids for Cougar (Mountain Lion) Encounters," Do not leave development of a plan of action until the moment that you are faced with a cougar. Every family and group member needs to know what should happen in the event of an encounter. Make time for a family or group sit-down with white board, to demonstrate both visually and orally what the plan is - it also helps to show children pictures of cougars so that they are knowledgeable about the animal.;
, A good plan should consist of how you will avoid cougar encounters in the first place and how you will react should an encounter occur. As part of this plan, you will all need to know what each person should or should not do and who is responsible for what. In this case, all persons over the age of 18 should be responsible for any children in the group and all persons who are teenage years and older should be ready to respond if children are attacked.

, This is your first line of defense. There are important things you can to do lessen the chances of meeting a cougar:


Be noisy as you hike or walk through cougar country and always hike in pairs at a minimum.
Camp in areas that do not have suitable hiding places for a cougar, if possible. A flat area well away from overhanging rocks is likely to be easier to patrol and notice problems than a campsite tucked under a rocky outcrop. When walking, however, avoiding such a place will be difficult.
Be aware of where children under 10 are at all times; older children with small stature should also be carefully watched for. Cougars do what any predator does - they wait for the stray to leave the group.
Make sure that your children understand not to wander off in cougar country at any time. Even bathroom trips during camping should be taken in groups.
Walk children to and from school if there are cougar sightings in your area.
Teach children to recognize the paw prints of cougars and to report any such sightings to you.
Do not touch or stay around fresh kill that has been buried - it is likely to be a cougar kill.

, The way in which you respond to an encounter with a cougar is important and each family and group member should know these things to avoid panic. Here are key things to consider:


Don't run. Flight can trigger the carnivore desire to chase and attack.
Stand up. Every person should be at their fullest height.
Face the cougar. A cougar should be faced full on and do not ever turn your back to it.
Pick children up and place them on your shoulders. This immediately puts the child out of the lower line of sight of the cougar and makes you and the child appear bigger. If you cannot lift the child that high, hold them in your arms. At the very least, have children grab your leg or torso and hold on, crowding around you.
Avoid having a child move if the child is closest to the cougar. The adult should do all of the moving to get the child. When moving, move slowly and without any jerking. Sudden movements can trigger the pouncing instinct.

, Do all of the things mentioned above but get more aggressive.


Wave clothing around
Throw sticks and stones
Yell, growl and bellow
Toss your arms around
Grin and bare your teeth
Move to a safe location if at all possible without running or crossing the cougar's path - for example, a car or a cabin; don't go for the tent - this will provide no safety and will only prevent you from seeing its next move

, If the worst possible thing happens and the cougar pounces and attacks a child, this is not a time for restraint. Attack the cougar with anything to hand, including your bare hands. Cougars rarely turn on other aggressors as they are focused on their prey. Hit the cougar with tree branches, cameras, walking sticks, cooking equipment, anything you have to hand and aim for its face in particular. It is important to know that many people have survived fighting a cougar attack by fighting back.

, A wounded, bleeding child is not safe after an attack. Immediately remove the child from the area and seek help. Adults can return later to collect belongings if needs be.

, Cougar attacks are rare in the greater scheme of things: ""For some reason, humans worry much more about rare dangers than about common dangers. For example, in California, from 1986 through 1998, exactly two people died from mountain lion attacks, whereas in one year alone, over 4,000 people died in traffic accidents, including 800 pedestrians.""Cougars are beautiful animals and being paralyzed by unnecessary fear and hounding an animal just because of the off-chance that it might attack are unhealthy perspectives to hold. Being prepared is one thing; being paranoid is quite another. Provided you take the appropriate precautions, know how to react in the rare chance something might happen and you keep a level and reasoned head about chance encounters with cougars, things should work out fine.

Remove all sources of standing water.,
Discard fallen leaves and decaying vegetation.,
Clear out clogged gutters.,
Spray your yard with mosquito killer.,
Install a spray system in your horse’s barn.,
Place screens on windows and doors.,
Keep your pets inside at dawn and dusk.,
Use a mosquito repellent on your pets.,
Do not use human insect repellents on your dog or cat.",How to Protect Your Pets from Summertime Pests1," Mosquitoes are a common summertime pest for animals. They breed in standing, stagnant water. To prevent mosquitoes from breeding on your property, remove any areas of standing water, such as flower pots, water buckets or bowls, and pool covers. Mosquitoes need only about 1/2 inch (1 cm) of water to breed, so be vigilant about not having standing water.Birdbaths can also attract mosquitoes. If you have a birdbath, change the water and clean the birdbath at least once a week.If you have a horse or an outdoor dog, they will need a constant source of cool, fresh water while they are outside. Change this water a few times a day to prevent the water from becoming stagnant and attracting mosquitoes.If you have a pond on your property, consider adding mosquito larvae-eating fish to the pond.These fish would help lower the mosquito population on your property. Visit a fishing supply store to learn which fish you should purchase.;
, Piles of leaves and vegetation (e.g., apples, berries) that fall from trees can attract mosquitoes and give them a place to hide. When you see piles of leaves and debris from trees, clear them up and throw them away., Clogged gutters can trap water, leaves, and other debris, which can attract mosquitoes. Cleaning your gutters will keep water flowing smoothly through the gutters when it rains. Plan to clean your gutters at the beginning of fall and spring. If you are not able to clean the gutters yourself, consider hiring a professional company that will do the cleaning for you., Yard sprays that kill mosquitoes are available at your local home improvement store. If you are unable to spray the yard yourself, consider contacting a pest management company instead. The company would focus on trees and shrubs where mosquitoes can hide during the day., For barns, it may be difficult to keep out the mosquitoes. Automatic spray systems are available that can periodically spray a mosquito repellent into the air. The repellent would likely contain pyrethroids, which are insecticides.Consider contacting a pest management company to install the system in your barn.

, Mosquitoes can be a big nuisance if they make their way inside your home. To prevent mosquitoes from buzzing around inside your home, place screens in the windows and doors. Check the screens regularly for holes or tears. Repair any damage you see.To repair holes, replacement screen material is available at your local home improvement store.Replace any screens that are damaged beyond repair.
If adding screens to your windows or doors is not practical, keep the windows and doors closed during peak mosquito hours: early evening to early morning., Mosquitoes come out at dawn and dusk. To prevent your pets from getting mosquito bites, keep them inside during peak mosquito hours.If you have a horse, keep it in its stall at dawn and dusk., Mosquito repellents are a great way to prevent your pets from getting bitten by mosquitoes. Several insect repellents (Vectra 3D, K9 Advantix II, BioSpot) are available for dogs. However, because cats are very sensitive to the insect-repelling ingredients in dog repellents, there aren’t many options for cat insect repellents. Highly-diluted essential oils (tea tree, mint) may be effective insect repellents for cats.Speak with your veterinarian before using essential oils as an insect repellent for your cat.
Cat-safe sprays and wipes that repel mosquitoes are available at your local pet store.Fly spray is an effective mosquito repellent for horses. Many types of fly spray are available, so talk to your vet about which spray would work best for your horse. It may help to rotate between several fly sprays., Human insect repellents contain DEET, which is extremely toxic to dogs and cats and can cause serious neurologic problems.DEET alternatives are available. However, these alternatives are usually oil based and can irritate the skin of a dog or cat.Use only pet-safe mosquito repellents on your dog or cat.


If you are putting insect repellent on yourself, do so in an area far away from your dog or cat so they are not exposed to the DEET."
"
Keep your grass short.,
Trim tree branches.,
Rake the leaves.,
Chemically treat your lawn and vegetation.,
Keep tick hosts off of your property.,
Give your dog or cat a year-round tick preventative.,
Put mineral oil on your horse.,
Check your pet’s skin for ticks.",How to Protect Your Pets from Summertime Pests2," Ticks are another common summertime pest. Like mosquitoes, they can also carry diseases that make animals very sick. Because ticks like to hide in thick and grassy areas, keep your grass as short as possible by mowing your lawn regularly.If you do not have time to mow your lawn, consider hiring a lawn care company that can do so.
Thick brush and woodlands give ticks a great place to hide. If you have thick brush or woodland on your property, clear these areas to keep ticks away.A controlled burn of these areas would also keep ticks away; this burn should be done only by natural resource professionals., Long branches can provide shade in which ticks can hide. If you have trees with long, overhanging branches, trim the branches. Keeping the branches short will increase the amount of sunlight on the ground, making it harder for ticks to survive on the ground.A lawn care company could trim the branches for you if you cannot do it on your own.

, Like mosquitoes, ticks like to hide in piles of leaves. When the leaves start falling from the trees in your yard, rake the leaves so the ticks don’t have a place to hide.Place the leaves in a closed container until you’re ready to throw them away.

, Spraying areas of your yard where ticks could hide will help keep ticks away. Products to spray your yard should contain pyrethroids. You can either spray your yard yourself or hire a pest management company to do the spraying for you. If you choose to do it yourself, read and follow the product labels carefully to ensure you use the product properly and effectively., Tick hosts are animals that carry ticks (a tick could hop on an animal’s back). Examples of tick hosts are rodents, deer, and rabbits. Several strategies are available to keep tick hosts out of your yard. For example, if you like to have plants in your yard, consider having plants that don’t attract tick hosts.Deer tend to stay away from plants that are thorny, sticky, or taste bad. Examples of plants and flowers that deer don’t like are rhododendrons and Black Eyed Susans.If you have a horse, its grain could attract rodents. To prevent tick-hosting rodents from accessing the grain, keep the grain in a tightly-sealed container., Although ticks can be a big problem in summer, dogs and cats should be protected from tick bites throughout the year. Using a tick preventative only during the summer could lead to tick infestations and potential illness in your pet.In addition, if you stop the preventative when the temperature cools down, you may forget to start the preventative again when it becomes warmer outside.


Over-the-counter tick preventatives are available. However, the preventatives available through your vet are much more effective. Your vet can recommend which one will work best for your dog or cat.
Most tick preventatives for dogs and cats are topical. You would apply the product on your dog or cat’s skin between the shoulder blades where it can’t easily be licked off. One application of the product usually lasts several weeks.
Tick preventatives for dogs and cats also contain ingredients to repel fleas.
Tick repellents for horses typically contain pyrethrins, another type of insecticide. However, these repellents last for only a few hours. Frequent reapplication of a tick repellent could be toxic to a horse, since its skin is very sensitive., Because tick repellent could make your horse sick, consider putting mineral oil on your horse. The mineral oil would make it hard for a tick to latch on to your horse’s skin. Apply the mineral oil to your horse’s mane, tail, belly, and lower legs. If you regularly take your horse in wooded areas where there could be a lot of ticks, put mineral oil on your horse each week., During the summer, check your pet for ticks each time your pet goes outside. Even if you use products to keep ticks off your pet, it is still a good idea to examine your pet’s skin. If you find a tick on your pet, remove it very carefully. If your dog or cat has a tick, use tweezers to grasp the tick on or behind its mouthparts. Lift up the tick slowly to prevent breaking off the mouthparts.Because ticks can transmit disease to humans, wear gloves when removing the tick.On a horse, pay special attention to the mane and tail when checking for ticks. If you see a tick, remove it using the method for removing a tick from a dog or cat. Do not drop the tick on the ground and try to crush it—if the tick is carrying a disease, stomping on it could spread the disease.After removing the tick, place it in a container with rubbing alcohol. Rubbing alcohol, not water, kills ticks.Clean the area where you removed the tick with soap and water. Then, wash your hands.
Consider saving the tick and taking it to your vet. If your pet becomes sick after the tick bite, your vet could identify the tick and determine what diseases the tick may have been carrying."

Vacuum your home.,
Wash your pet’s bedding regularly.,
Spray your home with an insecticide.,
Spray the outside of your home.,
Give your dog or cat a flea preventative.,
Comb your pet with a flea comb.,
Bathe your pet regularly.,
Keep your pet healthy.",How to Protect Your Pets from Summertime Pests3," Fleas can be a big problem for pets in the summer, especially for cats and dogs. Fleas can cause intense itching, which can lead to skin inflammation and infection, as well as anemia (low red blood cell count). Keeping your pet’s environment clean is a great way to protect your pet from fleas. Vacuum your home every few days, paying special attention to upholstered furniture, crevices, and baseboards where fleas could be lurking.Vacuum where your pet spends a lot of time.Throw away the vacuum bag each time you vacuum so fleas don’t accumulate in the bag.Fleas are not a big problem in horses. However, a horse could pick up fleas from a barn cat if that cat is infested with fleas., Flea larvae (early developmental stage) like to mature in dark, soft places like your pet’s bedding.To keep the flea population down in your home, wash your pet’s bedding in hot water once a week.You may want to go to a local laundromat to clean the bedding.


Wash your pet’s collar and toys as well. These items could also harbor fleas., Even if you vacuum frequently and wash your pet’s items regularly, fleas could still be a problem in your home. Fleas can ‘hitchhike’ on your dog or cat when they come back indoors, which could lead to a constant population of fleas.If you are concerned about a growing flea population, consider using an insecticide spray in your home.


Some sprays last as long as six months. Talk with your vet if you are thinking about spraying your home with an insecticide., If you have a yard, it is not necessary to spray your entire yard with a flea spray. Instead, spray only the areas where fleas are most likely to populate, such as crawl spaces and gardens.If you do not want to spray your yard yourself, hire a pest management company that can do it for you.

, Other than keeping a clean house, flea preventatives are one of the best ways to protect dogs and cats from fleas. Many flea preventatives are available that target different parts of the flea’s life cycle (eggs, larvae, adult).Because flea preventatives are usually combined with a tick preventative, the product your vet recommends to prevent ticks will also prevent fleas.


Use the product all year to ensure your dog or cat is fully protected from fleas.
Flea collars are also available, but, because they go around the neck, won’t be very effective at controlling fleas around your pet’s back end.Also, flea collars can irritate a pet’s skin.

, Combing through your dog or cat’s fur with a flea comb removes fleas. Consider putting petroleum jelly on the comb so the fleas stick to the jelly as you comb through the fur.As the flea comb fills up with fleas, dip the comb into rubbing alcohol to kill the fleas.You can use either a metal or plastic flea comb.
There is no recommended frequency for using a flea comb. Talk with your vet about how often you should use a flea comb on your pet.

, Because cats groom themselves frequently, bathing your cat probably isn’t necessary. If you have a dog, bathing it with a flea shampoo can kill adult fleas and prevent a flea infestation.Using a flea shampoo isn’t necessary, though—using a dog shampoo and combing through your dog’s fur with a flea comb during the bath is also effective at removing fleas.Because fleas like to move upward on a pet’s body, start at your dog’s head and work your way down to the back and chest. Make sure your fingers get all the way down to your dog’s skin—don’t just clean the fur.Do not bathe your dog more than once a week. Bathing more frequently could strip your dog's skin of natural oils that keep the skin moisturized.

, Fleas can become a big problem in pets whose immune systems are weak.The healthier you keep your dog or cat, the less likely they will suffer from a flea infestation. Keeping your dog or cat healthy involves feeding them good diets, keeping them physically active (e.g., walks, playtime) and taking them to the vet for regular checkups.


Your dog or cat’s health needs will change as they grow older. Taking them to your vet will help you learn how to keep them healthy throughout their lives.

Secure your garbage.,
Remove standing water.,
Pick up your pet’s feces.,
Trap the flies.,
Install a spray system in your horse’s barn.,
Use a fly repellent on your pet.,
Put a face mask on your horse.,
Groom your pet.,
Put screens on your windows and doors.",How to Protect Your Pets from Summertime Pests4," Flies are more than just a nuisance for pets. They can inflict painful bites and transmit serious diseases. Flies tend to bite areas of thin and sensitive skin, such as the ears; this is commonly called ‘fly strike.’Although flies seem to be everywhere during the summer, you can reduce the number of flies around your home. For example, secure your garbage in a tightly-sealed container.Rotten or spoiled food can attract flies. Blocking a fly’s access to garbage and throwing away the garbage regularly will help keep flies away from your home.
A type of fly called the blow fly is especially attracted to trash. Consider cleaning your outdoor trash cans with soap and water on a regular basis to remove garbage residue., As with mosquitoes, standing water can attract flies. If there is any standing water around your home or your horse’s barn, pour it out., Feces also attracts flies. To reduce the number of flies outside your home, pick up your pet’s feces every day.A horse can produce as much as 40‒50 pounds (18‒22 kilograms) of manure per day. Figuring out how to manage that much manure can challenging. Store it in a large holding area, such as a covered dumpster, and then decide whether to compost it, spread it with a tractor in a pasture, or discard it.Spreading manure is an ideal solution for managing horse manure. Spreading will break up and dry out a fly’s environment in the manure. Contact your local agriculture extension agent for guidance on how to spread the manure., Trapping the flies is another good strategy to protect your pets from these pests. Put up fly paper in areas where you have noticed a lot of flies, or where flies could be a potential problem.The paper has an adhesive that would trap the flies once they land on the paper.


Visit your local home improvement store or hardware store to purchase fly paper.
Discard the fly paper as dead flies start to accumulate.
You could also trap flies by filling a jar with a natural or chemical fly attractant (available at home improvement stores). The flies would enter the jar, but would not be able to fly back out.Dump out the jar and replace the fly attractant as needed.

, As with mosquitoes, an automatic spray system in your horse’s barn can keep flies out of the barn. Contact a pest management company to install the spray system in the barn., Fly repellents are very effective at preventing fly bites. Most of the pet repellents that repel mosquitoes also repel flies.In addition, for dogs and cats, flea and tick preventatives may also contain ingredients that repel flies.Talk with your vet to determine which fly repellent will work best for your pet.


Fly sprays and fly repellents are available for horses. Some of the sprays also contain sunscreen, which would be good if your horse spends a lot of time in the sun during the summer.Follow product label instructions carefully to ensure your pet is fully protected from flies.

, Flies can congregate around a horse’s eyes, leading not only to irritation but also skin damage. To protect your horse’s face, put a face mask on your horse when it is outside during the summer.Face masks are available where horse supplies are sold.

, A buildup of urine or feces on your pet’s backend could attract flies to your pet. These flies could lay eggs, which would produce maggots. These maggots could cause major skin damage on your pet. To prevent a maggot infestation on your pet, groom it regularly.Open wounds can also lead to maggot infestation if flies lay their eggs in the wound. While grooming your pet, inspect its skin for any open wounds. If you see any open wounds, take your pet to your vet for treatment., When your pets are indoors, having screens on your windows and doors will be very effective at keeping flies away from your pets.Periodically check the screens for holes. If there are holes, you can patch the hole with a section of replacement screen material, such as fiberglass.If the screen is badly damaged, it may be best to replace the entire screen.


Replacement screen material is available at your local home improvement store. The staff at the store can provide you with guidance on how to repair your damaged screen.

Desensitize your horse.,
Train your hands.,
Try it out.,
Quickly but calmly walk your horse through the gate.,
Walk him up to the gate's latch and close it.",How to Open Gates on Horseback," Before you can work on your own gate opening ability, you need to ensure that your horse will not be spooked by a gate swinging wide in front of him. To get your horse used to the scary movement of the gate, dismount and try swinging the gate gently in front of him while firmly holding him, ensuring he is calm and comfortable.

Continue to get him comfortable with the sound, the feel of the gate, the speed of the gate and so on. If he initially spooks and throws his head back or clearly looks scared, ease in more gently with reassuring pats on his neck and shoulders.;
, Before even trying to open a gate on horseback, you need to have nimble fingers and sensible methods to opening the gate. Try without your horse completely, continuously unlatching and re-fastening the gate as quickly and sensibly as you can. Be spatially aware when doing this and imagine if you were on a horse - you would stretch your arm out as far as you could and push the gate slowly to walk through it.

Try recreating this on foot; undo the gate and push it gently but firmly, leaving enough space for you and your horse. Then, re-fasten the gate and practise until you have it!

, When you approach the gate with the now desensitized horse and your clever hands, position your horse so that you can conveniently open the gate without having to stretch too much, putting you at risk of falling. At the same time you need to make sure no part of the horse's body is obstructing the pathway of the gate.

Once ensured you are in a safe place, undo the latch on the gate and push it slowly past your horse's face, and proceed to firmly swing it backwards.

, Turn him slowly around, just before the gate closes naturally. Make sure not to turn to quickly as your horse may go through the gate again or spook at the fast movement of it., Turn around and proceed with your hack!"

Figure out where you were when bitten.,
Look for a small, itchy, red mound.,
Look for swelling.,
Check for bee and wasp stings.,
Look for ticks.,
Check for head lice.,
Rule out serious spider bites.,
Look for the insect.,
Clean the bite area with soap and water.,
Use anti-itch cream if the bite itches.,
Cut down swelling.,
Treat for papular urticaria.,
Treat for shock.,
Seek medical attention.,
Watch for symptoms of other diseases.",How to Identify Insect Bites," Different insects live in different places, and there are certain circumstances where it is more likely to be bitten by each of them.If you were outdoors, and perhaps near a wooded area, you were probably bitten by a mosquito, tick, or spider.
If you were near food or garbage, you may have been bitten by a fly, or stung by a bee or wasp.
If you were indoors, sitting somewhere or playing with a pet, it may be fleas.
In the United States, scorpions are only found in the South and Southwest, particularly Texas and Arizona. Scorpion stings are extremely painful, and most of the time they are easy to rule out.If you were bitten in the southeastern part of the United States by a fly-like creature whose sting feels like a mosquito bite, it may be a deer fly.
If you were bitten in your bed while sleeping, it may be bedbugs.
If you were bitten on the beach, particularly in the southeast, it may be sand fleas.;
, This is the most common visible symptom of an insect bite, and depending on other symptoms could be from a variety of insects.A single bite mark is probably from a mosquito or fly. You may notice a tiny bite mark in the center of the mound of a mosquito bite.Flea bites are a number of small, itchy mounds grouped together. You will probably find them in areas where your clothes fit tightly to your body, such as around your waist.
Bedbug bites will be itchy red bumps, maybe with a blister, grouped in rows of two or three.

, Other types of bites or stings involve the swelling of the skin around the bite area.Fire ant bites will cause swelling (as much as 1/2 inch) and will fill with pus. They may blister over after a few days.Scorpion stings can cause swelling, as well as redness of the skin and pain or numbness in the area. Scorpion stings can be very dangerous, and they make most people very ill. Call emergency services or seek medical treatment right away if you suspect a scorpion sting., Stings from these insects will cause an immediate sharp or burning pain and swelling. They will leave a red welt (similar to a mosquito bite), with a small white spot where the stinger broke the skin. There will probably also be some swelling in the area. In the case of bees, they will leave their stinger behind.If stung by a bee, remove the stinger. Stinging a person will kill a bee, as the stinger is pulled out of the bee's body. You don't want the stinger to stay there, so use a credit card to help you scrape the stinger out. Attempting to use tweezers may accidentally force the stinger farther into your skin.Other stinging insects, like hornets, wasps, mud dauber wasps and yellow jackets, do not leave their stinger. If you have been stung, and there is no stinger left, that is probably what stung you. These insects can sting multiple times in a row.

, Bites from ticks tend to be bright red, but painless, so if you are not looking, you may miss having one. It is likely that you will discover the bite with the tick still attached to you. Most tick bites are harmless, but many ticks carry dangerous diseases like Lyme disease or Rocky Mountain spotted fever. You will want to be careful when discovering a tick bite.If the tick is attached to you, you will want to remove it as quickly as possible. Use a pair of tweezers to grab the tick near its head and pull — do not twist, as this can cause the head to pop off and remain attached to your skin. Don't leave any part of its head or body on you. When removing a tick, use tweezers, and not other items like petroleum jelly, matches, or nail polish remover.If you cannot get the head out, it is probably buried under your skin. If so, contact a doctor immediately, and they should be able to remove it.
Keep an eye on the bite area. If you see a rash in a bull's-eye pattern (erythema migrans), this is a sign of Lyme disease. Go to a doctor immediately.You should always check yourself for ticks after being outdoors in a wooded area, or walking through tall grass. Ticks like warm, dark places, so check all over your body. They can be as small as the period on the end of this sentence, so you may want to use a magnifying glass.
Tick paralysis is an uncommon ailment in which a female tick releases a neurotoxin, which causes temporary paralysis. It usually dissipates as soon as the tick is removed, and is most common in pets and children under 10.

, Head lice are usually found on the neck, scalp and behind the ears. Their bites will look like a rash on your head, and you will probably find the lice and their eggs (called nits) in your hair. If you have lice, you will need to wash your hair with non-prescription lice-killing shampoos, and wash any clothes and bedding that may have come into contact with them.If you are pregnant, do not use these lice-killing shampoos. Instead, talk to your doctor about the best ways to get rid of the lice.
An overnight coconut oil mask can be a great alternative for women who can’t use chemical treatments., Spider bites are slightly different than insect bites, and should be treated differently. Look out for one or two small, two-fanged puncture wounds (a sign of a black widow spider bite,) or a bite that turns blue or purple and begins to turn into a deep, open sore (a sign of a brown recluse bite.) If you notice these signs, call your doctor. Other, less serious spider bites may resemble insect bites.Black widow spider bites may cause stabbing pain, but they can also be painless. Look for the telltale fang marks, tenderness and swelling at the bite site. Symptoms to look for include muscle cramps, nausea, vomiting and even seizures.
The bite may become infected and swollen with pus.

, Most insect bites are painful, and you will notice them right away. If you feel yourself bitten, try to find the insect that bit you. Take a picture, or, if the insect is dead, collect the carcass. That can help you and your doctor identify what bit you, and what steps you should take next.


If the insect is still alive, do not try to capture it. That is a good way to get bit or stung again.
If the insect is dead, fold the insect in the piece of clear tape, taking care not to damage it, so you can show it to a professional.

, This will help clean the bite and can prevent additional infection. It's best not to use other creams or medications on the bite area until it is clean., Look for over-the-counter antihistamines like Benadryl or Chlor-Trimeton.Don't scratch the bite, as that can cause it to become infected.


Topical creams, gels, and lotions—particularly those containing pramoxine or benadryl—may help control itching.

, Make a cool compress, a cloth dampened with cold water or filled with ice, and hold it over the swollen area. If possible, elevate the bite area to reduce blood flow., Crops of raised, itchy, red bumps may appear as a result of a hypersensitivity to insect bites. This usually occurs after bites with fleas, mosquitoes, and bedbugs. Treatment for urticaria include antihistamines and topical steroids.Do not scratch these pumps, as this can result in scarring or infection.

, Some insect bites can cause an allergic reaction, which can be very dangerous. The first signs of a serious reaction are often hives, rash, a swollen throat or tongue, and trouble breathing. This is an urgent medical emergency, so call 911 or go to the emergency room right away. Use an EpiPen if you have one, as allergic shock can be fatal., In most cases, the effects like itching and swelling can go away quickly. If the symptoms persist, or get worse, you should look for a doctor, to make sure you are not suffering from a more serious reaction.If you think, or know, you have been stung by a scorpion, seek medical attention immediately.

, Insect bites may not be dangerous by themselves, but many insects can carry diseases. Ticks can carry Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and mosquitoes may carry West Nile Virus and encephalitis and can transmit these serious diseases to humans. Keep an eye out for other symptoms like fever, body aches, and nausea. These are usually signs of a more serious condition."

Cover all food sources, such as compost piles and trashcans.,
Reduce sweet smells during summer or fall.,
Remain calm near hornets.,
Avoid wearing sweet smelling perfumes.,
Don’t hang bird feeders, hummingbird feeders or other garden decorations that are yellow or colored like flowers.,
Apply some bar soap to the under-roof area of your birdhouses.,
Follow a wasp to see if it has made a nest near your house.,
Consider calling an exterminator if you have a lot of nests or they are in hard-to-reach places.,
Choose an aerosol hornet spray that allows you to get as far away as possible while you apply it.,
Wait until nightfall.,
Read the directions carefully and then spray.,
Watch the nest for signs of activity.,
Cover ground nests with a large bowl.,
Create or buy a wasp trap to catch hornets that didn’t die when you sprayed the nest.",How to Keep Hornets Away," Unlike bees, wasps and hornets like to eat meat and other protein foods, as well as sweet nectars. Hornets will remember the food source and continue to come around after it has been sealed off or taken away, so it’s best to prevent all open-air garbage.;
, This is the point when wasps prefer blossoms, juices and fruit. Pick up blossoms and fruit from fruit trees to avoid creating a food source.

, It’s better to walk away or move your picnic than to expect to kill them. Wasps release pheromones when they are in danger or squashed that may attract other wasps., A hornet can think of you as a possible food source.

, Bright colors attract wasps looking for food.

, It will keep hornets from making their nests in these ideal environments.

, Nests are often under decks, eaves and in trees. Although tree nests are usually abandoned after one year, house nests may house an overwintering queen and host the nest next year.

, There is some risk in destroying a hornet’s nest, so it’s best done with protective garments.


Call a professional if the hornets have access to the inside of your house. If they have made their nest in window cracks, foundation cracks, floorboards or any other house areas, you should not apply wasp killer.

, Unless you have a protective hood and suit, this is the best way to avoid being stung.

, Hornets and wasps return to the nest at nightfall and they are less active. This means you have a better chance of killing the majority of the nest., Get away from the area for the next few hours and encourage family members and pests to do the same. Hornets can sense when their nest is in danger, so it’s best to do this when there is very little noticeable activity.

, If you don’t see any activity, you may have killed the wasps. As soon as it looks abandoned, you should try to scrape it from the house, submerge it in water and throw it away.


If there is still activity, spray it again.
Use thick leather gloves and clothes when handling a nest or spraying a hornet’s nest. It will give you some protection against stings.

, Make sure the bowl seals airtight to the ground. Look for other entrances and repeat with another bowl. Set the bowl there for at least two weeks to ensure the colony starves before you lift it off.

, Place the trap away from human contact and hang it two to four feet above the ground. Leave the trap in the area for at least two days.


Make a trap by cutting the top off a two-liter bottle. Attach some string or wire to the sides so that it can hang from a tree. Drop the top inside the bottle, where it should catch on the sides. Pour a sweet substance, such as juice or sugar water through the funnel. Hang it in your tree. Wasps will enter and be unable to exit.
Empty and clean the trap every three weeks at nighttime. Make sure there are no active wasps in the trap at that time."

Watch for unusual behavior.,
Look for aggressive behavior.,
Watch for signs of anxiety.,
Beware if an animal seems overly friendly.,
Look for excessive salivation.,
Watch for signs of paralysis.,
See if the animal has seizures.,
Know that rabies is highly transmittable.,
Understand that rabies can be fatal.,
Use caution when interacting with wild animals.,
Seek medical treatment immediately, if you are exposed to the rabies virus.,
Keep your pets safe.",How to Identify a Rabid Animal," Animals who have the rabies virus may engage in behaviors that are not typical for that animal. For example, a wild animal may lose its fear of humans and come towards them. Similarly, a nocturnal animal may come out during the day. If you see an animal doing something atypical, get away from it and move to safety.

Call animal control and tell them about the animal, including where it is and what it's doing.
Don't approach the animal.;
, The most common sign of rabies infection is overly aggressive behavior. Aggressive behavior, and physical contact that often results, serves as a major reason for the spread of rabies to people or other animals.


Normally tame animals might growl, bark, or snap at people.
Wild animals may run or try to attack people.
Infected animals may show signs of destructive behavior, such as hurting themselves, property, or the environment around them., Infected animals tend to demonstrate some sort of anxious behavior soon after clinical signs of infection appear. Thus, any animal exhibiting strange behavior should be handled with caution.


Anxiety may manifest through nervous ticks or irregular movement.
A rabies infected animal may demonstrate anxiety by licking or chewing on their initial point of infection.
Anxiety may make the animal seem fearful of contact with people or other animals.
Anxiety may manifest through uncharacteristic shyness or irritability. Thus, normally friendly animals will be less social., While infected animals may appear aggressive or anxious, others show signs of signs of being friendly. Ultimately, friendliness in infected animals is one of the biggest dangers to humans or other uninfected animals, as contact with an infected animal can lead to infection.


Stay away from stray or feral animals that seem friendly. A friendly animal can turn aggressive very quickly, especially if they are infected with rabies.
Avoid approaching a wild animal because it shows signs that it is friendly.
Some infected wild animals may seem unusually calm or even docile., A common sign of rabies is hypersalivation – increase production of saliva. This is important, as saliva is the main vector for transmission of the rabies virus. Watch for:


Dribbles of saliva from the mouth.
Foaming of the mouth.
Excessive licking around the mouth, in a seemingly erratic pattern., Paralysis is the inability of an animal to move or properly use parts of its body. In conjunction with behavioral and other physical signs, paralysis is an important sign of rabies in animals.


Paralysis often manifests in the head or throat.
Paralysis may occur in the arms, legs, or elsewhere in the body.
Paralysis may begin around the site of infection and gradually move throughout the animal’s entire body., Seizures are one of the most common signs of rabies. Coupled with other symptoms, they are highly indicative of a serious case of rabies. Thus, seizures are an easily identifiable symptom that can give you a good idea if an animal is infected. Seizures are:


Characterized by shaking, rapid contraction of muscles, and irregular breathing.
Often the first sign before paralysis.
Present in about half the cases of paralytic rabies.
Not always present in rabies infected animals., The most important thing to know about rabies is that it can be transmitted to humans or other animals with relative ease. Ultimately, this makes it a very dangerous disease. Rabies can be transmitted if an animal or human is:


Bitten by an infected animal.
Scratched by an infected animal.
Exposed to the saliva, brain matter, or nerve tissue of an infected animal through an open wound or by touching mucous membranes., As a disease of the central nervous symptom, rabies can spread throughout an animal’s body fast, and quickly debilitate it. Death quickly follows the appearance of clinical signs of infection.


The incubation period is roughly three weeks to eight weeks.
Infected animals often die within 5 days after clinical signs of infection appear.
There is no cure for rabies. After clinical signs appear, death is almost guaranteed., Wild animals are the largest source of rabies infection around the world. Thus, you should always exercise caution, keep your distance, and avoid close contact with wild animals.


Raccoons are most associated with rabies in eastern North America.
Skunks commonly suffer from rabies.
Foxes are susceptible to rabies infection.
Bats are known carriers of rabies, worldwide.
Squirrels are rarely infected by rabies but commonly suffer from a brain parasite that shows signs like rabies.
Opossums are very resistant to rabies but may exhibit rabies-associated behaviors (aggression, salivation, and more) as part of their defense mechanism., Immediate treatment is important since there is no cure for rabies once someone shows clinical signs of infection.


A doctor will clean your wound.
If you have not been vaccinated before, a doctor will vaccinate you against the rabies virus.
The doctor may contact local authorities to alert them to the possibility of a rabies outbreak among domestic or wild animals., You can avoid rabies and keep your pets free from it by not letting them roam freely. Pets who roam freely may interact with an animal that is infected. Additionally, get your pets vaccinated against the rabies virus. This will keep them safe in the event that they do come in contact with an infected animal.

Contact your veterinarian to make an appointment to have your pet vaccinated.

Observe a gray, oval-shaped object made of paper.,
Look for the nest outside and up high in a covered area.,
Estimate the number.",How to Identify a Hornet1," While it’s not actually paper, it is a paper-like substance made from hornet saliva and wood. The nest houses eggs, and hornets are very protective of both their home and their eggs. Hence, you really don’t want to be caught near their nest lest they consider you a danger.While it starts as a small, honeycomb-looking object, as the colony grows, the nest expands to an oval shape resembling a football, stalactite, or inverted teardrop.
This means that just identifying the structure can help you narrow down your insect neighbors but does not determine exactly what type of insect they are.
Paper wasps also use a paper-like building material but their nests have no paper envelope that covers and protects the nest.;
, Hornets build their nests in outdoor areas and usually high above ground, such as in trees, on a utility pole, or in thick shrubs. They will also build nests on the eaves of roofs and under decks.Often you won’t see their nest until autumn when the leaves fall off and reveal the nest hidden within. By this time most of the hornets will be dead or dying, leaving only the queen to hibernate and live through the winter.
In contrast, yellow jacket nests can often be found either close to the ground, underground, or inside any loose structure they can find, such as between the inner and outer walls of a house or even inside an old mattress.
Some wasps that build nests high above the ground are incorrectly called hornets. The North American bald-faced hornet (Dolichovespula Maculata) is actually a species of wasp, as is the Australian hornet (Abispa ephippium), which is a subspecies of the potter wasp.

, Hornet colonies can have as many as 700 members. If the nest is significantly larger, one you think contains thousands of members, odds are you are looking at a yellow jacket nest. So keeping a close eye – from a distance – is key to knowing whether they are hornets or yellow jackets.


Whether the nest is small or large, the way to handle the nest is to call in professionals. These people will need to know how big the nest is so the more information you can give them the better equipped they will be to handle it."

Observe distinguishing characteristics.,
Look for black and white coloring.,
Be aware of the size difference between a hornet and a wasp.,
Distinguish further hornet body characteristics.,
Notice the wider width of the head behind the eyes.,
Look to see if the wings are folded down the length of their bodies.,
Note the absence of barbs on the stinger.",How to Identify a Hornet2," A hornet, like a wasp, has a thin waist between the thorax and the abdomen. This physical trait is known as being ""wasp-waisted."" It distinguishes them from the bee family, which have thick waists between the thorax and abdomen.

, Unlike bees, which have a brownish-yellow and black coloring, and some other members of the wasp family, such as the yellow jacket and mud dauber, which have a bright yellow and black coloring, most hornets are black and white.Some species, however, such as the yellow hornet and the European hornet, are colored differently so it’s important to also look at the insect’s “waist.”

, One main difference between a hornet and a wasp, one that is easily recognizable either up close or at a distance, is size. For example, the only true hornet in the USA and Canada is the European hornet, which grows to be approximately 1-1.5 inches long. The maximum size for a paper wasp or yellow-jacket is 1-inch and usually they are smaller than that.Hornets, like wasps, have six legs and two pairs of wings., Unlike other members of the wasp family, the section of the abdomen closest to the thorax, called the gasters, is more rounded in a hornet than in other wasps. This makes it the first area to look when needing further clarification as to whether you are looking at a wasp or a hornet.

, Called the vertex, this section is wider, in terms of the overall body size, in hornets than in other members of the wasp family.

, While some other members of the wasp family fold their wings down the length of their bodies when resting, it is another indicator to help you narrow down whether you are looking at a hornet or a wasp.

, Bee stingers are barbed, causing them to tear out of the bee's abdomen when the target is stung, which also takes the bee's life. In contrast, hornets, like other members of the wasp family, have barbless stingers, allowing them to sting repeatedly without losing their stingers.While this helps differentiate between a hornet or wasp and a bee, if you’re this close you may want to walk quietly away.

Know what a purse web spider is.",How to Identify a Purse Web Spider1," Here are some key characteristics.



Physical features: 11/18” (17mm) long

Poisonous: No

Lives in: Europe, Africa, Australia and Asia

Eats: These are predatory spiders that hide inside their silk-woven tubes. When their prey touches on the silk, the purse web spider will bite through the silk and pull the prey inside the tube. Purse web spiders eat insects and other spiders.

Take note of the spider’s legs.,
Watch the spider move.,
Observe the color of the spider.,
Note the size of the spider.,
Look at the spider’s eyes.",How to Identify a Crab Spider1," The most notable feature of a crab spider is its legs, which have longer front four legs than the back four legs. Sometimes these front legs also appear different than the other legs and are darker or hairier than their back counterparts. Like a crab, the crab spider’s front 2 legs also have incredibly strong claws which they use to grab their prey., While the crab spider’s legs resemble those of a crab, it is really their gait and movements that make them most similar to their namesake. If you gently provoke a crab spider, you will see that it moves sideways like a crab on the beach. That is because their legs have something called “laterigrade leg orientation,” which means that their legs are rotated at the base, causing them to move sideways like crab., Unlike some spider species like the brown recluse spider, the shared characteristic of crab spiders’ coloring is that it’s incredibly varied. Instead of looking for an all over color, as with the brown recluse, or the distinctive black and red coloring of a black widow spider, crab spiders are colored extravagantly to blend into their surroundings. Because crab spiders can camouflage themselves, they can be bright and vibrantly colored like a flower or a fruit, or they can be multicolored to blend into tree branches or leaves., With over 3,000 types of crab spiders, assigning a standard size to this type of spider is difficult. However, the vast majority of these species range from about 4 - 10 mm (which is the length of the body not including the legs).The female crab spiders are always larger than the males, especially when they are storing hundreds of egg sacs, and some male crab spiders are only 1/4 to 1/3 the size of their female counterparts. You should also look at the size and shape of the spider’s abdomen, as crab spiders typically have much more bulbous and round abdomens than other spider species., While the prospect of getting close enough to a spider to check out its eyes can be unnerving to some, crab spiders have distinct eyes. Unlike other insects, spiders have eight eyes that are round and smooth instead of two compound eyes that have numerous surfaces like the outside of a golf ball.Crab spiders normally have two big front eyes and have excellent eyesight. The most common species of crab spiders are brightly colored around these two front eyes, or they have a noticeable ridge below these eyes called a “clypeal carina.”"
"
Find out if crab spiders live in your area.,
Know where to look for crab spiders.,
Watch how the spider hunts.,
Note how the spider behaves.,
Search for any egg sacs.",How to Identify a Crab Spider2," With over 3,000 species of crab spiders, there is a fairly large range of climate zones that these spiders can withstand. While a few sighting of crab spiders have been noted in most parts of the world, they are most commonly found in:Northwest Europe
Northern and eastern Australia
North America

, If you live in an area where crab spiders are commonly found, the next step in identifying a crab spider is to recognize their preferred environments. Because crab spiders hunt by blending in with their surroundings, they will make a home wherever they blend in the best. While these habitats can vary depending on the specific species of crab spider, they most commonly make nests in:Bunches of fruit
The leaves of plants
Thickets of grass
Flowers, especially brightly colored varieties
Pollen-producing plants

, Crab spiders are considered a hunter spider; however, the vast majority of crab spiders are not active hunters.This means that instead of actively pursuing prey, most crab spiders sit camouflaged in their nest for days or weeks at a time until an unsuspecting prey wanders too close. The clawed front legs of the crab spider are incredibly strong, and they use the additional length of these legs to reach out and grab insects. They then pull their prey in with their front legs and inject them with immobilizing venom, rarely moving their body or shorter back legs at all while hunting., Unlike some other spider species, the crab spider is a non-aggressive spider. Crab spiders are not only passive while hunting, they are also incredibly timid and fearful of predators. Their uneven leg lengths make them fairly uncoordinated in comparison to other arachnids, which can leave them vulnerable to prey. Rather than attacking a predator, crab spiders will flee to the other side of their nest or abandon their home completely if they spot a predator nearby., Crab spiders are unique in that they do not create webs like other species. Instead, crab spiders lay their eggs on whatever surface they’ve camouflaged themselves with, fastening the eggs to the surface with their silk. If you see any silken egg sacs that appear flat and are joined at the center, you most likely have identified a crab spider nest. Just keep in mind that female crab spiders will commonly remain near these egg sacs in order to protect them from predators, including you!"
"
Identify a crab spider bite.,
Manage crab spiders when found indoors.,
Cope with crab spiders outdoors.",How to Identify a Crab Spider3," Spider bites from any arachnid family look like two distinct puncture marks. These puncture marks are caused by the hollow fangs that all spiders use to inject venom into their prey. A crab spider’s bite is not dangerous to humans because the venom is not potent enough and most crab spiders are not big enough to break the skin with their fangs. However, some species like the giant crab spider (Olios giganteus) are big enough to puncture the skin, and the bite from the larger crab species is said to be pretty painful., Due to the crab spider’s preferred habitat, it is very unlikely to find this type of spider inside. If you do happen to find one inside though (and you’re not too scared!), it is recommended that you gently capture the spider by scooting it into a cup, covering it, and releasing it outside. They are not harmful to humans and are a great way to control the population of other insects like bees, wasps, mosquitoes, and flies. Some other tips for reducing the number of crab spiders in your home include:Check all flowers and plants for crab spiders before you bring them inside, especially flowers recently cut from a garden.
Capture and discard or relocate individual spiders that have wandered inside because they reproduce rapidly.
Remove or regularly inspect any potted plants and flowers inside the home as this is the most likely spot a crab spider would reside in indoors.

, Crab spiders are harmless to humans, so eradicating them from your outdoor area is not advised unless there is an extreme infestation. Try to see the crab spider as helping to keep your home free of bees, wasps, mosquitoes, flies, and other pesky insects. However, if you prefer to reduce the number of crab spiders in your outdoor area, you can:Remove all piles of plant debris, like piles of kindling, grass clippings, or mulch.
Keep grassy areas near your home cut short.
Avoid planting pollen-producing plants.
Periodically remove crab spider nests with a broom or a hard spray of water.

Ask someone to check your scalp.,
Comb through your hair.,
Wash your hair.",How to Get Rid of Ticks in Your Hair1," Make sure that they put on gloves before they start. Ask them to check all areas of your head and scalp. Ticks can be quite small, so the person should look for tiny brown or black flecks on your skin.If they see any unattached ticks, they should pick them up with gloved fingers, a piece of tissue, or tweezers.
It will be easiest if you have a partner remove the tick from your hair for you, but if you are doing it yourself, use a mirror to help you see your scalp.;
, Using a fine-toothed comb, brush your hair to loosen any ticks that might be hiding. If any ticks fall off or become stuck in your comb, kill them by putting them in a cup of rubbing alcohol., Within two hours of coming inside, take a shower, and wash your hair with normal shampoo. This can help rinse away ticks before they have a chance to attach.Doing this soon after you come home will reduce the chance that the ticks will burrow into your skin."
"
Part your hair.,
Grasp the tick with tweezers.,
Pull the tick straight out.,
Dab the site with disinfectant to kill germs.,
Avoid smothering or burning the tick.,
Visit a doctor if you cannot remove the tick.",How to Get Rid of Ticks in Your Hair2," You may need to pull your hair away from the tick so that you can reach it. Use a comb or a toothbrush to move aside the hair. Be careful not to touch the tick. Secure the hair away from the tick with a clip., Get the head of the tweezers as close as possible to the surface of the skin. If the tick is swollen, avoid grabbing it by the stomach. It may release fluids into your body that can cause disease.Many tools are sold that are designed for tick removal. You can use one of these instead of tweezers. The process of pulling out the tick will be the same.
If you do not have tweezers, you can use gloved fingers or tissue paper, but this is a more difficult method. Be careful not to squeeze or crush the tick.

, Avoid twisting or yanking the tick out, or the tick might break, leaving parts of their mouth inside of your body. Instead, use a steady hand to pull the tick straight out from the skin., Dip a cotton swab into rubbing alcohol, iodine, antiseptic cream, or another disinfectant. Gently apply it around the area of the tick bite. Wash your hands when you are done., Do not try to smother a tick by putting nail polish or petroleum jelly (like Vaseline) on it while it is still attached. Furthermore, burning the tick may injure you without removing the tick. These methods can cause the tick to burrow deeper into your skin or to release diseased fluids into your body., If you are struggling to remove the tick, see a doctor immediately to do it for you. For two weeks after tick removal, visit the doctor if you have any signs of illness, such as rash, fever, joint pain, or swelling of the bite.Ticks can carry various diseases, such as Lyme disease, Colorado tick fever, or Rocky Mountain spotted fever.

"
"
Put the tick in a secure container if you want to test it for disease.,
Tape the tick if you want to identify its species.,
Drown the tick in alcohol to kill it.,
Flush the tick down the toilet to get rid of it permanently.,
Use caution when you go outside to avoid ticks.",How to Get Rid of Ticks in Your Hair3," You can use a jar, ziplock bag, or any sealed container. If you develop symptoms within two weeks of the bite, take the jar with you to the doctor. The doctor can send the tick out for testing.If you want to save a tick for testing, do not squash it, burn it, or put it in alcohol. Simply put it in the container, and leave it until you are ready to test it.
Medical testing can be expensive. Even if the tick carries a disease, it does not mean that you have been infected.

, Attach the tick onto a piece of paper with a sturdy piece of transparent tape, like packing tape. This will keep it contained until you can identify what type of tick it is. Different species are likely to carry certain diseases. If you become sick, this information can help your doctor make a diagnosis.You can bring it to the doctor or you can look up different species of ticks online to identify it yourself.
Black-legged ticks are more likely to carry Lyme disease while lone star ticks and dog ticks can give you Rocky Mountain spotted fever., If you do not want to save the tick, kill it with alcohol. Fill a cup or bowl with rubbing alcohol, and dunk the tick inside. Leave it for several minutes. This will likely kill the tick., Just to be safe, you should avoid throwing out a tick in the trash. Instead, wrap it in a piece of toilet paper, and flush it down the toilet. This will ensure that the tick is safely out of your home., Next time you go outside, try to prevent ticks from latching onto you. There are many things you can do to reduce your chance of a tick bite.Apply an insect repellent containing DEET. If you have children, spray the repellent on for them.
Use permethrin on all of your clothing and gear. This is usually available at outdoor stores.
Check everyone for ticks after coming inside. Pay special attention to their arms, knees, waist, belly button, ears, and hair. Remember to check pets as well!
After coming inside, put your clothes in the dryer on high heat for an hour to kill any ticks that might be hiding in your clothing.Light-colored clothing will let you see ticks more easily. Wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and boots if possible. Tuck these into one another."
"
Use bait.,
Invest in glue traps.,
Try a light trap.",How to Get Rid of a European Hornet1," Certain gels and baits, when transported to the nest, serve to poison and kill European hornets. This can be an effective means of pest control.


Honeydew gel is an effective means to poison European hornets. It can be purchased from most hardware stores or greenhouses.You can leave honeydew gel on shrubs and trees where you see hornets gather. Once it is carried back into the hornet nest, it will cause hornets to get sick and die. Sometimes the whole nest dies and other times a few hornets die, signaling dangers and causing the hive to navigate elsewhere.Honeydew gel may take a few days to work properly. If you do not see a reduction in the infestation in a week, you might want to try other means.;
, Glueboards are sticky paper boards you can attach to the siding of your home in areas where hornets congregate. Try to leave the boards around light, as hornets are attracted to bright lights as it makes hunting easier. When hornets fly into glueboards, they become trapped and eventually die. This can be an effective means to get rid of a small infestation where the nest itself is not near or in your home., Hornets are attracted to light, especially at night. A light trap can attract hornets to a large glowing light or orb and then kill them via electrocution.


European hornets are stronger than moths and other nighttime pests so you'll need a strong light trap. Look for something of at least 110 voltage.
In order for the light trap to work, you'll need to turn off other nighttime lights in your yard so the hornets are solely attracted to your trap."
"
Try cypermethrin.,
Purchase a liquid insecticide with the active ingredient Thiamethoxam (such as Optigard Flex).,
Use phantom aerosol.",How to Get Rid of a European Hornet2," If hornets frequently congregate your home, a bug spray called cypermethrin can be used. You use this spray by dousing the siding of your home and light fixtures. It does not kill wasps, but does repel them. If a nest is not near your home, cypermethrin can be a good way to keep wasps from bothering you. It is generally not toxic to people or animals, but it can cause indigestion for family pets, so keep it out of reach of dogs and cats. You can find this product at most greenhouses or hardware stores., Insecticides are sprays that works much like honeydew. They do not kill pests on contact but poison the colony when accidentally transported by one or two wasps back to the nest. If you suspect a hornet nest is close by, consider an anti-gel bait.


Spray the insecticide you purchased, following the directions on the container, in areas where you've seen hornets. Areas like house siding, lights, and plants are optimal. With luck, a hornet should land on one of these places and accidentally bring a dosage of the gel back to the nest.Usually, the colony is contaminated within 3 to 5 days. At this point, the hornets will either die off or abandon their current nest. If you do not know where a suspected hornet's nest is, insecticides can be an effective treatment option., Phantom aerosol is a spray that works on impact. If you've located the nest, spraying aerosol around the area should effectively kill the hornets. However, be careful. You may want to contact an exterminator instead as you do not want to risk getting stung. Keep in mind that phantom aerosol should not be used on living plants."
"
Recognize a hornet's nest.,
Contact an exterminator or pest control.,
Take safety precautions.",How to Get Rid of a European Hornet3," If you find a nest in your home or near your home, you need to call an exterminator. It can be very difficult and even dangerous to remove a nest in your home without professional assistance.


Hornet's nests are usually found in covered areas. In houses, they'll likely be tucked in or under a drawer or cabinet, in the eaves of the house, or in attacks Outdoors, they tend to be found in treetops.Hornet's nests are made with papery substances derived from saliva and bits of wood pulp. Hornet's nests get bigger as the colony grows and can even reach the size of a basketball net., If you find a nest near your home, immediately contact pest control or an exterminator. You should do this as soon as possible. If you cannot afford a professional exterminator, pest control can generally do the job for free as it's a safety concern., Unlike bees, hornets stingers do not fall off upon impact. They can sting over and over again, making them dangerous in large groups. While waiting for the nest to be safely removed, take certain precautions.


Stay away from the nest. Keep pets and children away as well.
Watch for signs of allergic reaction, like redness and swelling, if you get stung. Any signs of an allergic reaction should be evaluated by a doctor as soon as possible."

Learn to identify sand fleas.,
Scan yourself for bites.,
Apply a topical antihistamine.",How to Get Rid of Sandfleas1," The average sand flea can range in size from a speck of salt to a grain of rice. In fact, sand fleas often look like sand particles themselves, which is how they’re able to attach to their hosts without being noticed. While it is possible to spot sand fleas with the naked eye, you’ll usually have to look quite closely.Sand fleas most often attach to feet and legs since they’re closest to the ground.If you notice something crawling or jumping anywhere on your body, you can be sure it’s not just dirt.;
, Sand fleas bite their hosts in order to feed and embed their eggs. Their bites leave behind round, red spots that may burn or itch intensely. The bite of a sand flea can be extremely uncomfortable and will almost always cause irritation, especially when rubbed or scratched.A small black head or white pustule at the center of a bite may be an indication that a sand flea has burrowed into the skin and laid eggs.
Resist the urge to scratch itchy sand flea bites. While this may provide temporary relief, it increase the risk of spreading infected saliva or egg deposits beneath the skin., Medications like Benadryl and Neosporin can help alleviate the burning and itching brought about by sand flea bites. It may also be useful to swab the bite with rubbing alcohol, as this will dry out the wound and prevent it from becoming infected. Most sand flea bites will clear up within a week or two and won’t cause any lasting health effects.Essential oils like lavender, eucalyptus and tea tree can also offer drying action and relief from itching.
If you notice a sand flea bite beginning to swell or grow more painful, visit a doctor right away.

Use pesticides throughout your home.,
Vacuum your carpets and upholstery.,
Wash used clothing and bedding.,
Inspect your shoes and clothing when returning home.",How to Get Rid of Sandfleas2," Spray pesticides in places where sand fleas may be lurking, such as floors, carpets and furniture. To avoid exposing yourself or your pet to harmful chemicals, choose an organic pesticide product that’s been approved for home use. Pesticides will essentially shut down the sand fleas’ nervous systems, killing them within a matter of hours.There is evidence to suggest that natural compounds like diatomaceous earth and salt are effective for eliminating sand fleas. Sprinkle the compound around problem areas, let it sit for up to 24 hours, then suction it and any dead pests up with a vacuum.Do not use pesticides containing toxic chemicals in areas frequently occupied by you, your family or your pet.

, Go over spots that may harbor hidden sand fleas. Pay particular attention to the rooms and routes you tend to use the most, as there’s a better chance that sand fleas will be found there. Repeat this process once a day until the infestation is under control.Use your vacuum’s brush head attachment to dislodge sand fleas stuck down deep in carpet fibers.
Empty or dispose of vacuum bags after vacuuming.
Vacuuming helps to remove pests and their eggs that are too small to be detected., Sand fleas can easily be concealed in the folds of clothing and bedding and may not stand out on light-colored fabrics. After discovering signs of a sand flea infestation, these items should be cleaned immediately. Wash each load of laundry with hot water and strong detergent.Always wash clothing, towels and other beach accessories as soon as you get home. You should never reuse dirty items, as there’s a chance they could contain sand fleas.
Be sure to check your partner’s clothing and bedding items as well if you happen to share a room.

, Take a quick look at your legs and the tops and bottoms of your shoes before reentering your home. This is especially important if you’ve recently been to the beach or anywhere else where you might encounter sand fleas. It’s possible for undetected sand fleas to hitch a ride into your living space, making the problem worse.


Start leaving your dirty shoes outside until you’ve had a chance to clean them.

Check indoor pets for sand fleas.,
Groom your pets thoroughly.,
Clean pet bedding and toys.,
Be wary of where you take your pets.",How to Get Rid of Sandfleas3," Though most land animals aren’t at risk of sand flea infestation, dogs and cats with thick fur may carry them into your home unknowingly. Spread your pet’s fur with your fingertips and look for bites or swelling. It may be difficult to spot sand fleas themselves depending on fur color, but their red, inflamed bites will almost always be visible at skin level.Pay attention to behaviors like excessive scratching or licking. These could be warning signs that your dog or cat may be carrying sand fleas.
Though tedious, being vigilant about checking for pests is the best way to keep them from setting up in your home.

, Give your pet a bath using warm water and shampoo, then towel or blow them dry completely. Once you’re finished, apply an anti-flea medication to prevent sand fleas from coming back. The life cycle of adult sand fleas is around 48 hours, so it may be a good idea to keep your pet indoors during this time.Dab a little antihistamine cream on your pet’s bites to reduce itching and redness.Take your pet to the vet if you suspect that it may be a host for sand flea eggs.

, Vacuum any objects with soft, porous surfaces to ensure that unseen sand fleas won’t immediately return. This includes things like dog beds, blankets, pillows and soft fabric toys. Steam cleaning has been shown to effectively wipe out sand fleas lodged in clothing and other objects.Consider treating pet areas with an organic pesticide or diatomaceous earth. Be sure to vacuum and clean them afterwards so that your pet doesn’t accidentally ingest any harmful substances.

, Sand fleas are most commonly found in warm, humid marine conditions. They tend to be most active between late night and early morning. If you often walk or play with your pet in these types of places, schedule your outing for daylight hours and stick to the sidewalk or tall grass to minimize their chance of contracting sand fleas. Dogs are at especially high risk of picking up sand fleas due to their tendency to roll and dig.
Cover up or spray yourself with insect repellent before spending time in places that are natural habitats for sand fleas."

When attacked: stand your ground. Don't run away as this will tempt the bear to chase you, and you won't be able to outrun a bear anyway. Don't try to climb trees, either - bears are better climbers than you are.

,, All mothers are protective of their babies, so it is likely that if you seem innocent enough the attention will be diverted back to the infants.


Use pepper spray.






Once a bear actually makes contact, surrender. Assume a defensive position and curl into a ball and stay still. Often, after a bear thinks the threat has been removed, it will leave. If the bear leaves, stay motionless for as long as possible. It may react if you regain composure when its back is turned.






Fight back if they continue to attack. Some bears have been driven away by people using their hands, rocks, and sticks to fight back. It is always important to dodge two main areas of the bear - the teeth and the claws. Therefore, you might see it as wise to make your way to the back of the bear and do your damage to the spine, which will lessen retaliation from its 'danger zones'.








(When standing your ground, try not to intimidate the bear, but rather, make yourself look important, like something the bear might injure itself with).

, 80% of snake bites occur when someone tries to capture a snake. If you are being attacked by these creatures, get away from the head. This may seem obvious, but without venom, a snake may as well be a slug for all the damage it can do. Do not try to stomp on it either, even from behind, as they have sharp reactions and will sink their teeth into your ankle. Instead go for distracting it, which can include distancing yourself behind obstacles such as fallen logs, or even throwing things to divert its attention.

,,, This is strictly for the movies and will not help, and may make your situation worse than it already was.

Avoid strong scents and loud noises around Africanized honeybees.,
Run to shelter if attacked.",How to Deter Bees1," Catnip essential oil has been shown to be effective at driving away bees and mosquitoes, and can be purchased from aromatherapy shops or online. Other strong-scented substances such as peppermint oil or cloves are often used to repel insects, but may not work as well as other options.


Do not apply these substances to children under three years of age.If not sold with instructions for applying to skin, look up the substance online first, to see if it causes irritation or health problems.;
, Bees do not seek out humans unless they perceive them as a threat, so insect repellants for personal protection are not typically useful. However, some specialized bee repellants such as Bee Go or Honey Robber can be used to repel bees from an area. These are available from stores that sell beekeeping equipment.


In the United States, check the label for an EPA-approved logo before buying, so you know it is safe for human use and the environment.Spray repellents are by far the most effective type of commercial insect repellent. Candles, foggers, coils, clip-on battery-powered devices, wristbands, and electronic sound-based repellents rarely work to drive off insects., Listen for a buzzing noise while walking through the wilderness, and don't put your hand into any crevices you can't see into. Bees often nest among rocks or in trees, so be extra alert while climbing.While most honeybees do not bother humans, ""Africanized"" honeybees will aggressively defend their hives. These are found in many areas in Southern America, Central America, and along the southern border of the United States.
If you hear a hive, or you know there are hives in the area, keep pets nearby, preferably on a leash.

, While clothing probably does not have a major effect on bee attraction, dark clothing and red clothing is more likely to cause bees to perceive you as a threat.Leather and furry articles of clothing may also alarm bees.

, The USDA and some other agencies recommend not using strongly scented perfume, shampoo, gum, or other materials in areas with Africanized honeybees. Similarly, loud noises from chainsaws, lawn mowers, and other machinery may alarm these especially high-strung bees.These factors are unlikely to matter around other bees unless you have already disturbed the physical hive itself.


Remember that some treatments for dogs, horses, and other animals may contain strong scents as well.
While one study did not find any bees attracted to perfume, the study was small and may or may not have included Africanized honey bees., If you are attacked by a large number of bees, immediately run to the nearest vehicle or building, or keep running until the bees stop chasing you. Pull your shirt up over your face only if it does not slow you down.Do not enter a body of water unless you have no other choice. Some bees may wait for you to come up for air, then continue stinging.
Once you are safe, remove bee stingers from yourself by scraping them with your fingernail, the edge of credit card, or a similar object. Do not pull them out, as this can cause more venom to enter the wound.

Identify where the lizard is.,
Corner the lizard.Chase the lizard into a progressively smaller area.,
Place a cardboard box along one edge of the wall.The box should be open along one face.",How to Catch a Lizard Without Using a Trap1," Some lizards can move fast, while others move slow. If you find a lizard, you will need to act quickly to catch it. If it scampers off -- behind a piece of heavy furniture, for instance -- you will need to wait for it to reappear before making your move.


If the lizard is hiding out somewhere for a long time, you may need to resort to using a trap.;
, You should move your hands around and toward it to guide it in a certain direction. For instance, if you want it to go to the right, move your hand toward it from the left. Keep it away from doors, windows, and air vents. Direct it to an area free of clutter with a good line of sight. When you’ve cornered the lizard, it will not be able to escape.


Slowly make your way towards the lizard. If it starts to run, stop moving and it will probably stop running.
You can quirt cold water on a lizard to get it to slow down or stop entirely.

, Aim the open face of the box toward the lizard. If the lizard is climbing a wall, you or a friend will need to hold the box in place along the lizard’s path.


Once the lizard has entered the box, cover it with another piece of cardboard to keep the lizard trapped within. Ensure the lid has several small holes punched in it so the lizard can breathe.
If the lizard is not interested in entering the dark cardboard box, you can direct the lizard into the box by shooing him inside gently with a broom. Push the lizard toward the box with the broom, touching only its side, tail, and back legs.
Do not hit the lizard with the broom.

Drive bees away with smoke.,
Use mothballs.,
Use bitter almond oil.,
Lure bees to other areas nearby during picnics.",How to Deter Bees2," Bees will flee from smoke, or become dazed and less aggressive if they inhale too much. Build a campfire or light a smoky candle to keep bees away from your camping or picnicking area. A barbecue is unlikely to be effective, due to the attractive scent of meat.


Citronella candles, which are often sold as insect repellants, may be effective at driving away bees purely because of the smoke, not the citronella., Mothballs contain a powerful pesticide that can drive away or kill many insects, including bees. This option is more commonly used in attics and storage spaces, but some picnickers put mothballs in fine mesh bags or old nylon stockings, and hang them from trees.Mothballs can be dangerous to humans as well.Keep mothballs away from children, and avoid the strong-smelling fumes they produce.

, Bitter almond oil, or its pure active ingredient benzaldehyde, can be used to repel bees. Pour a little onto a rag, and keep it in a warm, breezy, outdoor area where it will evaporate quickly. Be aware that it may cause harm in large quantities, although some studies disagree.Keep the rag away from pets and children.


Some people add an equal amount of tea tree oil to the rag, which may also drive away bees.This has not been scientifically tested, but may work in some cases.

, Sometimes, attracting bees to alternate options may be an effective method of control, especially when you are using deterrent methods around your own food. Some people report success when laying out dishes of sugar water, maple syrup, or strips of banana peel on the opposite side of the lawn or field, so the bees feed from other areas instead.Keep these lures a significant distance away, or they may backfire.


If wasps are around as well, lay out both sugar and meat, as different types of wasps are attracted to these two substances.
Do not use this method at a campground, since animals such as bears or skunks may be attracted by the food as well.

"
"
Avoid leaving out items that attract bees.,
Cover bodies of water when possible.,
Add vinegar to smaller containers of open water.,
Use soapy water to kill bees foraging near water.,
Block all holes that could become potential hives.",How to Deter Bees3," Keep food covered and put sweet things away as soon as you've eaten them. Use plastic trash bags and tightly closed lids in all outdoor trash cans.

, Bees forage for water a fair distance from their hive, so you may see bees around pools, irrigation systems, or other water sources even if there are no hives nearby. If the bees successfully retrieve water, they may return more frequently, and in greater numbers. Use a pool cover when swimming pools are not in use, and repair broken irrigation systems, leaky pipes, or other sources of puddles., Vinegar may make a water source undesirable for bees, causing them to move somewhere else in search of water. Add about 2 tablespoons (30 mL) vinegar per gallon (3,800 mL) of water before filling outdoor water containers for animals, including bird baths.


While pine scented cleaner may be more effective, it should only be used in water that no humans or animals drink from., If these deterrents are not enough, killing the bees that come to forage for your water may prevent an influx or more bees. Mix 1/8 cup (30 mL) dish soap with 2 cups (480 mL) of water and put it in a spray bottle. This spray can quickly kill individual bees trying to retrieve water.While the death of a few bees is unlikely to harm the hive, hiring an exterminator for larger-scale control is not recommended unless the hive is already established in or near your house. Bees are an important pollinating species for many plants.

, If bees are swarming in your yard, or present in great numbers, you may need to perform a full check of your house and yard to block them from all potential hives. This can be a tedious task, but is still much easier than removing a hive once it is established.


Caulk or cover all holes and cracks that are at least 1/8 inches (3 millimeters) wide.Check the walls, foundation, the chimney's attachment to the wall, and all sheds and outbuildings.
Use tightly fitting screens to cover larger holes. Cover drains, vents, ill-fitting doorways or windows, and all other large holes with tight-fitting, fine mesh screens.
Fill animal burrows with dirt, or cover them until the swarm has passed by.

"
"
Obtain a long, skinny stick.The stick should be about two to three feet long, and no wider than an inch or so in diameter.,
Obtain some dental floss and form a slipknot.The dental floss should be about ten inches long, with seven inches on the loop side and three to four inches hanging down from the end of the stick.,
Catch the lizard in the loop.Tie the long end of the loop to the end of your stick.,
Remove the slipknot as quickly as possible.To remove the slipknot, place the lizard on a flat surface.",How to Catch a Lizard Without Using a Trap2," If you cannot find a stick with these dimensions, you could whittle a wider, longer one down to the appropriate size.

, Tie a slipknot with the dental floss.


To tie a slipknot, bring one end of the dental floss about two thirds of the way down towards the other end of the dental floss. The dental floss should resemble a “C.”
Holding the curved side of the loop in your left hand and the two ends of the “C” in your other, twist your left hand to form a loop. Pass your left hand through the loop and pull the bottom arm of it back through. Do not bring the entire arm of the floss through the loop. Leave the tip of the floss just outside it.

, The loop should hang about four to six inches down from the end of your stick. Approach the lizard you want to catch slowly and cautiously. Hang the loop slightly in front of it and either wait for it to enter the loop or gently ease the loop around the lizard’s neck. Either way, when its neck is within the loop, pull up gently to tighten the slipknot and catch the lizard.

, Place one hand over the lizard with your index finger resting gently on top of its head. Move your other hand slowly but cautiously toward the loop tied around its neck and pull the floss away from its body. This will loosen the slipknot and allow you to ease it off over the front of its head.


There is little chance of hurting or choking the lizard with the slipknot when it is only stuck within it for a short while. However, if you leave the lizard fighting the slipknot or struggling to break free, it might hurt itself. Remove the slipknot as soon as possible.

"
Locate the lizard.,
Locate the lizard’s escape hole.,
Guard the ends of the lizard tunnel.,
Retrieve the lizard.",How to Catch a Lizard Without Using a Trap3," Follow the lizard’s tracks and look for the imprint of the lizard’s belly scales in the nearby dirt. These are signs that a lizard hole is nearby. Locate the hole and wait until you actually see the lizard go into it before proceeding with the lizard-catching process. Otherwise, you run the risk of the lizard not being there., The hole may be completely revealed. If it is completely revealed, your job is done. If it is not revealed, you are dealing with a species that leaves a thin layer of dirt between the hole and the earth above. Scrape the surface of the sand in a 1.5 meter (4.9 ft) radius around the opening of the lizard’s hole with a shovel to locate the exit hole. When you notice the dirt or sand collapsing in at the shovel’s touch, you’ve located the exit hole., Find the midpoint between the exit and entrance holes and position yourself there. Once you’ve located the midpoint, get a friend to stand guard at the exit hole and another to guard the entrance hole. They should be ready to grab the lizard if it makes a run for it., Stomp down hard on the earth above the midpoint between the exit and entrance holes you located. This will loosen the sand within and above the burrow. Thrust your hand deeply into the loose earth. Feel around for the lizard. Grip it in your hand and pull it out of the ground."
"
Wait for the lizard the pop its head out of its hole.,
Drive the shovel into the ground.Holding the shovel at a forty-five degree angle, stop when you’re within about one or two meters of the lizard.,
Scoop the lizard up.",How to Catch a Lizard Without Using a Trap4," Barking geckos and some other lizards will sit halfway in their underground tunnels and poke their heads out to call for mates. When you see such a lizard, approach the lizard from behind with a shovel, moving slowly and silently to avoid startling the lizard., Plunge the shovel deeply into the ground approximately one foot directly behind the lizard. Use all your might when bringing the shovel down behind the lizard. This will prevent it from escaping back down into its hole.

, The lizard will probably be startled and freeze. In this case, gently remove the lizard from its hole with one hand. It helps to have a small container or box into which you can corral the lizard so that it will not run off. However, if the lizard does run off, track it to ensure it doesn’t escape into another underground tunnel.


Grab it as soon as possible, bringing one hand under its belly with its head just below your index finger and your other hand resting snugly over the lizard’s back.

"
"
Make sure the lizard you are about to catch is not dangerous.,
Catch lizards in your house as soon as possible.,
Use gloves when handling the lizard.,
Check your local laws before releasing lizards.Depending on the type of lizard you’ve caught, you may or may not be able to release it back into the wild.,
Approach lizards from the side.The lizard is more likely to panic and scramble out of your grasp if you try to grab it by its tail -- which might actually come off in your hand depending on the species -- or try to grab it from above.,
Support small lizards with one hand and larger lizards with two hands.",How to Catch a Lizard Without Using a Trap5," While most lizards are merely annoying rather than dangerous, certain exotic species can dangerous.Always be sure you know exactly what kind of lizard you’re trying to catch before doing so.


If you have a lizard in your house that could be dangerous, contact animal control or a private wildlife removal service to catch the lizard.
Leopard lizards and collared lizards should especially be treated with care., While most lizards are not a direct threat to humans, they can carry infectious bacteria like Salmonella. If your cat or dog catches and eats the lizard, it may become infected with Salmonella. Children, likewise, might think lizards are fun to play with and become ill. For these reasons, if you observe a lizard in your home, act swiftly to catch and remove it.

, In order to prevent the transfer of Salmonella and other germs, wear disposable latex gloves when handling small lizards. After catching the lizard and placing it in a cage or container, remove the gloves and dispose of them. If handling larger lizards, you should wear thick gloves to prevent your hands from bites or claws.Thick work gloves or gardening gloves should suffice. Wash any clothes that may have come in contact with the lizard.

, Contact your local department of environmental protection about what you can and cannot do with your lizard.

, These movements are similar to those used by its natural predators. Instead, let the lizard see you from the side and slowly bring your hand below its belly.

, With small lizards, one hand is usually enough. Bring your hand beneath them, with your index finger arching up between their front legs and stopping just before their neck. With larger lizards like iguanas or monitors, you will need to support the lizard with two hands. Place one hand in the same position you would for a smaller lizard. Place your other hand on the lizard’s belly, with your wrist between its rear legs."

Steer clear of hippos.,
Definitely avoid hippos in shallow water.,
Alert them to your presence.,
Retreat.",How to Deal With a Hippo Encounter1," Hippos are territorial and become aggressive when they feel threatened, so respect their space. Keep on their good side by giving them a wide berth when you spot them in the water. Do not attempt to travel down waterways that are choked with numerous hippos..


A hippo’s “yawn” is actually a warning sign that you are approaching too near.;
, As a defensive tactic, hippos prefer to stick to areas where the water is deep enough for them to fully submerge. If a hippo is forced to occupy shallow water due to drought or territorial disputes with other hippos, it will feel vulnerable and lash out with little provocation. Consider these hippos to be the most dangerous in the water, and give them an even wider berth accordingly.In ideal waters, a hippo will keep as much of its body underwater as possible during the day to prevent overheating. Only the top of its head and back will break the surface so it can breathe., Hippos are herbivores and do not regard humans as prey.However, they become belligerent when startled.Do not attempt to slip by them unnoticed. When you spot a hippo, announce your presence while you are still well away from it. Beat the side of your boat with your hand or strike the water’s surface a few times with a paddle.Continue slapping your boat or the water when you see a hippo go underwater. Allow it to track the sound of your progress so it knows where not to surface. Expect it to remain underwater for as long as six minutes.Use a paddle or a similar long object to strike the water, since crocodiles often occupy the same waterways as hippos.

, If a hippo opens its mouth in a “yawn” as you approach, reverse course immediately. Recognize that the hippo is showing off its teeth to scare you off. Back your boat away and put as much distance between the two of you as possible. Maximize the distance that it has to cover in order to reach you, since hippos’ charges are very brief while in the water.Should the worst happen and the hippo strikes your boat, remember that the issue is territory. Flee the area in any direction except for where you first saw the hippo, and it should lose interest in you.

"
"
Stick to open areas.,
Stay to the inland-side of hippos.,
Keep your eyes peeled for dung signs.,
Run for cover.",How to Deal With a Hippo Encounter2," Allow yourself a wide range of vision so that you can spot any hippos in the area long before you can reach it. Give the hippos the same opportunity to spot you from a safe distance. Remember that hippos are easily startled, but will show little interest in you if they see that you are maintaining a respectful distance.Definitely steer clear of dense vegetation along the edge of waterways. If space within the waterway is limited, those hippos that have lost territorial disputes may congregate here. They will feel especially vulnerable and that much quicker to attack out of fear.

, Remain aware of the direction of the nearest body of water. When you encounter a hippo on land, always allow it a clear path to the water. Even if you maintain a respectful distance without posing a threat to the hippo, anticipate that some other factor may startle it at any time. Expect it to flee for the safety of the water. Keep well out of its path.Should you find yourself in front of a hippo running for the water, flee to either side. The hippo has no interest in you, but it may outrun you or see you as a threat if you run for the water as well.

, Hippos use their feces to mark paths between waterways and food sources inland. Expect these paths to be travelled continuously, especially at night.Look for dung that has been sprayed over a wide area, rather than a neat pile, since hippos use their tails to spread their poop around as they excrete.If possible, do not strike camp near a dung trail, because hippos are nocturnal and will use the path at night. If you are forced to camp near one, do not start a fire or use any other lights, since these will spark their interest., In the event that a hippo charges you, be aware that hippos can reach speeds of 30 miles per hour (45 kph).Do not try to outrun a hippo in a straight sprint. Seek cover immediately. If no buildings or vehicles are in sight, use natural cover and obstacles like trees, rocks, hills, and termite mounds to slow the hippo’s momentum.If a hippo charges you, remember that it is because you have intruded on its territory. Once you have gained enough distance from there, it should give up the chase.

"
"
Beware of hippos in the mating season.,
Avoid boating in the dry season.,
Expect them on land at night.,
Leave calves alone.",How to Deal With a Hippo Encounter3," Regard the males as especially dangerous at this time of the year. Expect them to already be keyed up and aggressive due to fierce competition between themselves for mates.Hippos typically mate at the start of the rainy season, but may do so at other times of the year as well.Always be on the lookout for males fighting each other to the death, which is a contest for breeding rights to a female.


West Africa's rainy season lasts from June until September. South Africa experiences theirs between October and April. East Africa sees two rainy seasons per year, with one lasting from March until May, followed by a second that lasts from October through December., Expect hippos to act even more territorial as waterways shrink in size. Look for hippos crowding closer toward the middle of the waterway to remain submerged. Anticipate the added danger of having less and less maneuvering room for yourself. Also be aware that their food sources have most likely dried up as well at this time of the year, which will further agitate them.The later in the dry season, the more dangerous hippos will be. In West Africa, the dry season extends from November until April. Southern Africa sees its dry season from November until March. East Africa experiences two dry seasons, one lasting from December until February and a second between June and September., Hippos are nocturnal. During the day, expect to see them resting in the water to stay cool. At night, travel carefully, because hippos will leave the water to seek out food. Minimize the risk of startling them in the dark. Stick to open areas to increase both of your chances at spotting each other from a distance. Travel slowly to avoid stumbling upon them with no warning.Hippos may travel as far as 3 miles (5 km) from their waterways in the search for food. They may also resettle in smaller bodies of water farther inland., You should never interact with a young hippo no matter how they may look or how tempting it may be. Mother Hippos are ferociously protective of their young and will readily come to their defense if they feel that their young are threatened in any way. Recognize a fully grown hippo as standing at roughly 5 feet tall (1.5 m).Consider anything shorter than that as a calf, since calves will remain with their mother until they have fully grown.Remember that just because you only see the calf doesn't mean the mother isn't somewhere nearby.

Determine what's biting you.,
Change your sheets.,
Tuck your sheets between the mattress and the box spring.,
Vacuum thoroughly and regularly.,
Eliminate standing water from your home.,
Have your blankets and comforters professionally cleaned.,
Switch out your bed frame.,
Seal your home well.,
Seek help with a professional exterminator.,
Find a camping site in a bug-free area.,
Invest in a waterproof tent.,
Buy mosquito netting.,
Apply a bug repellent before you sleep.,
Burn sage.,
Cover up your body.",How to Avoid Insect Bites While Sleeping," You will be able to prevent future bites if you know what sort of bugs you're dealing with.Bed bug bites, most common around the home, are large, splotchy, red bites. If you've ever been bitten by a mosquito, bed bug bites look very similar.


Flea bites will be smaller red bites. They often appear around the ankles or lower legs. If you have pets, get them checked for fleas. You can pick up a flea medication at your local veterinarian office.
Bites from lice will appear in your hair. You may not be able to see them, so have a friend or family member check for you. They are red and itchy. These bites can also appear in other sections of your body hair.
You don't want to mistake other irritants for bug bites. Allergies cause similar redness and swelling, as do toxic chemicals such as pesticides or solvents. Emotional stress and anxiety can also cause similar breakouts.;
, To prevent insects from getting into bed and biting you at night, wash and change your sheets often.Your dead skin cells will fill your bed, and these cells will attract insects. Washing your sheets every other week isn't terrible, but a weekly cleaning is ideal.


Even if you cannot see the bugs in your bed, they can definitely be present. Tiny microscopic bugs called dust mites may be biting you at night. These bugs are attracted to the dead skin cells that stick to dirty sheets.
Use hot, soapy water to get a deep clean on your sheets. Make sure that you let them dry completely in the dryer. Moist sheets can collect mold.
If you've washed your sheets and you're still finding bites or insects in your bed, buy new sheets. It's a bit of an investment, but you'll be thankful in the long haul.
Try moving your bed frame away from the wall.Even a few inches of space can be helpful. You'll reduce the ability for bugs to move between the wall and your bed.

, Most bugs will scurry into any opening in a bed that you leave for them. It's best, therefore, to eliminate any area that they could nest in.Don't let your sheets drape onto the ground.


Remember that bed bugs cannot fly or jump. You can take advantage of their fairly limited mobility by tucking your sheets in.
If you have dust mites, however, you actually don't want to make your bed. If you leave your bed unmade, you'll remove moisture from your sheets and mattress. Eventually, the mites will dehydrate and die. Dust mites need humidity to survive, so any dry environment will kill them.

, It isn't enough just eradicate bugs from your bed itself. You'll need to use a vacuum to kill any remaining bugs.You also want to pick up scrap particles from your carpet. Any extra detritus will attract bugs into your area. Vacuum often to ensure that your carpet will be free of creatures in the future.


Get an attachment for the vacuum to access hard to reach places. This could include the space behind your headboard or along the tack strips at the edge of your carpet. Be sure to move your bed from its usual location. You need to clean the entirety of your carpeted floor.
If you don't have carpet, you can use a mop with soap and water to clean the area around your bed.

, Even if you don't have a pool or another body of water near your house, you may still be attracting bugs to your property.Mosquitos lay eggs their eggs near sources of water, so they will take advantage of any liquid that could be out in your home.


Drill holes in open containers, such as trash cans, that may be collecting water in them.
Change birdbaths and pets' water bowls as often as you can. These are breeding grounds for mosquitos to be laying eggs.
Don't leave pots, pans, or full glasses of water out.

, Taking these larger items to your local dry cleaners for a full cleaning or treatment can prevent future infestations.Inform them of your concerns. Many cleaners will have processes and relatively safe chemicals to discourage bugs from nesting in the fabric.


For more severe cases of insect infestation, call a professional cleaning service to come to your home and eliminate the bugs.Don't take this step unless you're confident that you have bugs living in your bed, however, as it can be quite expensive.
You can invest in a mattress encasement that is designed to fend off bed bugs. This encasement wraps around the entirety of your mattress and contains infestations. Any bugs trapped within the encasement will die off.

, You may not have to worry about this preventative measure unless you're suffering from a bad case of bites.Bugs often hide within wooden frames, so changing to a metal frame may eliminate them from your bedroom. Wooden frames also sit closer to the floor, giving bugs easy access to traveling from the floor into your bed.


You also want to avoid a bed with a headboard, if you can. Headboards are breeding grounds for insects, and they'll be able to easily slip through the porous wood and into your sheets. If you need a headboard to sleep, try using a metal one instead.

, If you can stop bugs from entering your home, you'll prevent them from biting you at night. You also will avoid paying exorbitant prices for new furniture or professional cleaning.


Close cracks and crevices near bare plumbing or wiring.Smaller bugs can travel easily through these narrow paths.
Get quality silicon or acrylic latex caulk to fill smaller holes around doors or windows.If your hole is any larger, you may need a sturdier filling, such as sheet rock or mortar.
Because the insects biting you are likely very small, mesh screens on your doors and windows probably won't do much. Keep these openings closed when you can.
Improving your general sanitation can help your bug problem. Don't leave dishes sitting out overnight and always clean up any spilled food crumbs.

, If you're having trouble permanently eradicating your bug problem, you may want to call a specialist. Professional pest control companies generally use a mixture of steam treatment and insecticide.Starting with a steam treatment works best; your insecticides will kill any bugs that the steam misses.


Make sure that your professional is using an insecticide with d-phenothrin as its active ingredient. D-phenothrin's major use is in the killing of small nuisance insects, such as bed bugs and ticks. It's more than likely that these sorts of creatures are the problem.
If you don't want to pay for an exterminator, you can try doing a steam treatment yourself. You'll have to purchase your own cleaner. Make sure that it produces a low vapor, high temperature steam.
Stand as close to the bugs as you can. Move at a rate close to one inch per 10 seconds. Anything quicker than this might become nonlethal for your pests.

, Figure out where insects traditionally gather. You may be able to avoid dealing with them while you're in the great outdoors.While bugs can be present anywhere, they generally surround bodies of stagnant water. When camping in warm, moist climates, you'll definitely want to avoid still pools and lakes.


A campsite on higher ground is advisable when searching for a spot. Pitching your tent on a hillside is advisable. Avoiding low, flat areas will distance you from any large stagnant bodies of water.
Stick to higher ground, even if your area is fairly dry. Any rainfall, even if it is minimal, will attract more bugs to your area.

, When using a traditional tent without as much protection from the elements, bugs can fly into your shelter with a bit more ease.A waterproof tent, while more expensive, does a great job keeping bugs out. This will eliminate the number of bites that you will get while sleeping.


Waterproof tents, while thicker, have more breathability than a traditional tent. This means you won't notice the larger area of protection that surrounds them. Fresh air will flow in and out easily.

, In addition to a waterproof tent, you may want to invest in preventative bug netting.These netting systems are great for protecting against bug bites during the day. These will fit nicely around a hammock. You'll be able to rest easily while napping.


You can try a free-standing mosquito net. They are basically small tents, held together by metal or plastic frames that can be easily put away.You fit them nicely into a larger tent, so that once you zip up the outside of the primary tent, you won't let bugs in.
If you aren't camping with a tent, you can use a wedge mosquito net. The net hangs from two suspension points, draping over the sleeping bag or cot that you've brought to the outdoors. This brand of net is easy to set up and quite inexpensive.

, Be sure that you're using a product that's safe for your skin, as certain repellents are made for the air. Choosing products with the active ingredients DEET or picaridin are often the most successful.You need to be cautious before using any bug spray. Do not spray in an enclosed area, such as your tent.Only apply to exposed skin; you don't want to spray underneath your clothing.
If you want to apply bug spray to your face, spray into your hands first, and then rub the spray onto your face. Spraying directly into your eyes is a bad idea.
Always check the label of your repellent before using it on your skin. Using the wrong product can be extremely toxic and dangerous.
Explore more natural ways of keeping insects away by creating a natural bug repellent.From lemon eucalyptus oil to vanilla extract, you can use a wide range of easily accessible products and create simple concoctions.
It may take you a little while to perfect these recipes. Remember that it's a good way to avoid releasing toxic chemicals into the atmosphere.

, Toss a stick of sage onto your campfire just before you go to bed to ward bugs away.Most people find the smell soothing, and it's a good way to avoid spraying chemicals around your campsite area.


You can throw fresh or dried sage onto the fire. Hang them in a cool, dry area for a week to let them dry fully. Dried sage can also be used to kindle your fire.
Other herbs, such as lavender and mint, can also be used for similar results.

, Don't allow your skin to show while out in the woods. This invites bites from a large number of bugs.Mosquitos, in particular, will feed upon supple flesh. While the heat may sway you from layering up, you'll be thankful when you aren't scratching at any painful bites.


Make sure that you're wearing long pants while you sleep, as well as socks. Pull your socks over your pants, so bugs can't get into the legs of your pajamas.
You'll also want to wear long sleeves, and you should tuck your long sleeve shirt into your waist.
All of your sleeping gear should be tight around the ankles, wrists, and your collar. It may be impossible to completely block off your hands and your neck area, but you'll be covering as much skin as you can.
Treat your clothing with permethrin, a great bug repellent for killing unwanted insects.

If you live in a rural community or don't have a car, and you have to walk from place to place, do so with a fast pace.,
Be sure to seal any cracks around your house that may allow for snakes or other nasty critters to crawl in.

",How to Avoid Snakes," Wear sturdy hiking boots and long pants.;
, If you are in a situation where you can not in fact avoid tall grass, keep your eyes peeled for snakes and make sure your presence is known.

, Do some research ahead of time and see what types of snakes are common in your area, what they look like, and where they are most likely to be.

, Try to avoid heavily wooded areas. If you can not, then wear a hat.

, Snakes respond to the vibrations they feel along the ground, and so will be able to feel you coming and hide. Remember, snakes are just as afraid of you as you are of them, if not more so. They do not actively try to hunt humans. Rather, they will try to stay away.

, Being aware of your surroundings. Look down where you are walking so that you don't accidentally step on a snake.

,, If you are standing there, the snake may see your feet and confuse them with a rat, and then you would have a snake biting your feet.

, When you are walking on the sidewalk, make sure you stay in the middle of the sidewalk.

Avoid chigger habitat areas.,
Wear loose-fitting clothing.,
Guard the back of your knees, armpits, waist, elbows, groin or ankles.,
Apply insect spray.,
Take a hot shower with plenty of soap immediately after participating in outdoor activities.,
Wash your clothes immediately after coming inside.,
Wipe your legs, arms and waist down with rubbing alcohol.,
Purchase sulfur powder from the local pharmacy or garden supply store.,
Plan outdoor activities for the coolest part of the day.",How to Avoid Chiggers," These include overgrown grass, weeds, briar patches and brushy areas. Shady spots with these types of brush and weeds are often areas where thousands of chiggers may wait, looking for their next meal. Additionally, if you walk through these areas, do not sit, kneel or lay down in the grass or weeds.;
, Wear long sleeved shirts and long pants when venturing outside. Tuck pant legs into boots to prevent chiggers from getting into your clothing and onto your skin. Chiggers tend to accumulate at tight-fitting areas, such as the top of socks, waistbands or watchband areas. Avoid tight-fitting accessories and garments.

, Chiggers like wrinkled or thin skin, or skin that rests against itself, so these areas are prime locations for them to strike.

, Any insect repellent that deters mosquitoes will work on chiggers. Spray the repellent at all clothes openings, such as cuffs, pant leg openings, neck and where your shirt buttons. Reapply the spray every two hours.

, The soapy water tends to wash off any chiggers on your body. However, if they have already bitten you, you may still experience itchiness.

, If you don't, the chiggers will still be waiting for you the next time you wear your clothes. Wash clothes in warm, soapy water.

, Some experts contend this will not help, but many people insist that this not only helps to rid your body of chiggers, but it also decreases the itchiness of the bites.

, While sulfur powder may not smell good, it helps to repel chiggers. Sprinkle it lightly on your shoes. This way, chiggers must be forced to cross the sulfur line in order to climb up your leg. This will not help avoid chiggers who get on you from above your foot. If you wish to avoid those chiggers, sprinkle sulfur powder on the rest of you.

, Chiggers are most active during the hottest parts of the day.

Decide whether or not the elephant in the situation is actually going to charge.,
Watch the elephant's ears.,
Listen for warnings.,
Look for displacement activities.",How to Survive a Charging Elephant1," It is thought that most charges are ""mock"" (threat) charges, that is, the elephant is pretending to charge but is actually testing you out to see if you're aggressive or a non-threat. Be able to recognize the difference between an elephant who is making a mock charge and an elephant who is about to trample you.;
,


If an elephant's ears are relaxed, he is probably making a mock charge. Ears that are fanned out are indicative of a mock charge.If the elephant's ears are pinned back flat, it is likely that the charge is real.This will often be accompanied by a trunk that is curled inward., You're likely to hear trumpeting of a warning from the elephant.

, There are some other indicators of an elephant working out whether to charge or retreat. These include a twitching trunk and swinging one leg to and fro.The biologist responsible for discovering this, Dr. George Schaller, realized that the more pronounced these ""displacement activities"", the more likely the elephant was making a threatening show out of fear and had no intention to really charge.

Use a DEET-based chemical repellent.,
Apply a Picaridin-based repellent.,
Spray permethrin repellent on clothing.",How to Avoid Gnat Bites1," DEET (N, N-diethyl-meta-tolumide) is the most effective chemical ingredient for repelling bugs.Apply bug repellent containing DEET to all exposed areas of skin before going outside. Be sure to reapply the repellent according to the product’s label’s instructions. Make sure not to use DEET-based repellents when wearing sunglasses or plastic eyeglass lenses, as the chemical can dissolve plastics and some synthetic materials.A few studies have suggested there can be adverse side effects to DEET. DEET-containing repellents have however been approved by the EPA and the Center for Disease Control as safe for long-term human use when used according to the label instructions.;
, Picaridin is a synthetic compound derived from plant extract. It is man-made like DEET, but a compound rather than a chemical. Picaridin has not been as widely tested as DEET, but current studies show it to be just as effective, and it is not harmful to any materials. Many of the major bug repellent producers, such as Cutter, carry repellents based on Picaridin., Permethrin is both a repellent and insecticide, meaning that is has the ability to kill bugs on contact as well as repel them by scent. It is recommended by the EPA (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) for use on clothing, shoes, bed nets, and camping gear.Spray only on fabrics, and do not spray on clothing while you're wearing it. Use only repellents and permethrin-based products that have specific instructions for treating clothing.After a item has been sprayed with a product containing permethrin, the fabric will repel insects through several washings.

Stay downwind of the elephant at all times.,
If the elephant appears to be making a mock charge, you have the option of standing absolutely still.The problem with this is that it is very hard to do when an elephant is bearing down on you.,
Be noisy.,
Do not show your back to the elephant.,
Look for something to keep between you and the charging elephant.,
If you must run, try to do it in a way that deceives the elephant.,
Climb.,
Hop into a ditch.",How to Survive a Charging Elephant2," This way, the elephant will find it difficult to smell you and seek you out (elephants have a keen sense of smell). If you can hide downwind, you might be able to avoid any further encounter.If you do run, stay downwind to make following you more difficult.

, It does show the elephant that you're non-threatening and it removes the desire to chase you. However, you'll need to judge the suitability of this move by the size and aggressiveness of the elephant before you.

, It might be possible to shoo off the elephant by making loud noise if there is some distance between you and the charging elephant. Some think that this a very good option if you're inside a vehicle.On the other hand, if you're on foot trying to dodge the elephant when it's very close to you, others think that staying quiet is probably a much better option.However, according to biologist Michael Fahey, screaming and yelling is very effective (you can see him on video below, demonstrating scaring away a charging elephant). It is likely that this option should be used only where you see indications of a mock charge.You can also shake trees, rattle bags, make noise using whatever objects are to hand.
A loudly and repetitively shouted ""No"" is good if you can't think of anything else.
Note that Michael Fahey shoos away a small-ish mother elephant. You might not be so willing to shout at a bull elephant in must, a time during which the elephant will be exceptionally aggressive and more likely to charge with intent to harm., Do not turn or run! Running encourages chasing. (However, if you lose your nerve and do run, see steps on running below.) Biologist Michael Fahey says that ""the probability of you getting killed is much lower if you stand your ground than if you run.""

, Do a quick look around you to see if you can duck behind something larger than you or something that can act as a shield. For example, a vehicle, a building, a pile of rubble, a large tree, etc. In some cases, getting inside a tree might work if it's possible. This is something that Gabonese hunters do, sliding inside the stilt roots of swamp trees, which seems to be adequate to ward off a charging elephant.If you do hide somewhere, be aware that you must be absolutely still and quiet, for elephants have acute hearing.If there is a vehicle and you can maneuver it quickly enough, drive off. Be warned though, if the elephant is already close to the vehicle, it may charge the vehicle and you risk being tipped over and pounded.

, A charging elephant can run much faster than you but if you zig-zag, you might be able to confuse it. Elephants find it difficult to change directions due to their bulky size. And, of course, run as fast as you can––your life depends on it.


If you do run, the intent should be to place as much distance between yourself and the elephant. Elephants that are scared, upset or angered can run up to 35–40 km/h (21.7–24.9 mph) (the fastest human being clocks in at around 37kph for a short sprint).A wicked but true fact––the elephant will get the slowest runner. That's your bid for safety if you're in a group. Of course, few people want to see sparing their own life coming at the expense of another, so it's kinder to yell out instructions for sparing everyone's life if possible and to try to ensure everyone reaches safety.

, Elephants can't climb, obviously. And provided you find a sturdy enough tree of good height, it might be enough to put space between you and the marauding elephant.


Keep in mind that the elephant might rip the tree down, so be on the lookout for signs that it might try this next.
Be warned! It might not be wise to jump into water. Apart from the fact that the water might harbor other non-friendly wildlife, elephants are surprisingly good swimmers and it may decide to simply follow you.

, In some cases, people have evaded a charging elephant by dropping into a large ditch and staying low.Be warned that if the ditch isn't wide or deep enough, the elephant may find its way around and start going for you with its trunk.

"
"
Throw a decoy.,
Resort to noise again.,
Play dead.,
If you survive, check that everyone else is okay.",How to Survive a Charging Elephant3," If you're running and the elephant is drawing nearer, throw a jacket, hat, bag or branch a distance away from you. This might serve as enough of a distraction for the elephant to attack it instead of you.While it's attacking the decoy, run as far from the elephant as you can.

, As outlined in the previous section, being noisy might be all you have left, so stand your ground and roar like a lion.

, It's not an optimal choice and you are extremely exposed if the elephant decides to stomp on you, either deliberately or unwittingly. But if it's all you have left, curl up, protect your head with your arms (or a pack/camera) and play dead. Wait and wait until the elephant tires of you and leaves. Hopefully without stepping on you.

, Attend to any wounds and seek help. Let local park rangers, keepers, police and other relevant parties know what has happened.

Try lemon eucalyptus oil.,
Apply other botanical oils.",How to Avoid Gnat Bites2," Some people are more comfortable with natural instead of chemical repellents. Lemon eucalyptus oil has been proven to repel bugs. It is sometimes recommended by pediatricians as an alternative to DEET or Picaridin. Like DEET-based repellents, repellents containing lemon eucalyptus oil are recommended by the CDC (Center for Disease Control) as an effective and safe way to repel bugs.You can buy many repellents based on the oil, such as Repel’s Lemon Eucalyptus Repellent. These are not all-natural repellents, but are based on the oil.
Make your own. A natural, homemade lemon eucalyptus repellent should consist of around 10% lemon eucalyptus oil mixed with a carrier oil, such as witch hazel, vodka, or olive oil. Take a 4 oz clean spray bottle and fill it with 2 ounces of distilled or boiled water. Add 1 ounce of witch hazel or vodka then about 50 to 75 drops of essential oil.Avoid using any product containing lemon eucalyptus oil on children under three years old.

, Other kinds of natural oils may repel gnats. You can purchase either the oil itself or a repellent containing it. Oil of citronella, lemongrass, cedarwood, garlic, spearmint, lemon mint or cinnamon are common and can be sprayed on your skin or in places where gnats gather.


To make a natural insect repellent spray using an essential oil, mix the essential oil with the carrier oil or alcohol, using the same process as for lemon eucalyptus oil. If making a large batch, mix the repellent so it's 5-10% essential oil, or 1 part essential oil with 10-20 parts carrier oil or alcohol. For a smaller batch, use 10-25 drops (total) of essential oils and 2 tablespoons of a carrier oil or alcohol. Rub or spray the natural insect repellent onto skin or clothing, using care to avoid the sensitive eye area.
You can also crush fresh leaves of these plants and rub the leaves on your skin to deter gnats that bite.You will need to reapply oils or leaves about every half an hour, since they provide only about 20-30 minutes of protection.

"
"
Wear loose-fitting clothing.,
Choose long clothing.,
Use netting to protect your face and neck.,
Try permethrin-treated clothing.",How to Avoid Gnat Bites3," Gnats cannot bite through clothing, so an easy way to avoid getting bit is to wear clothing that fits loosely. Tight clothing can stretch over the skin and provide holes in the fabric that gnats can bite you through.

, Long sleeve shirts, gloves, and jeans, for example, provide good coverage. This is especially helpful in summer and early autumn when bugs are more active., This is a good short-term solution when you are faced with a large number of gnats. Tie ordinary garden netting over your head. Wearing a hat makes this easier. Throw the netting over your head or hat, wrap it loosely around your neck, and either tuck it into your shirt or tie loosely with a piece of strong. This will protect your head and neck while still allowing you to see.

, In extreme cases, you may wish to buy permethrin-treated clothing to cover your entire body. It is the only insect repellent currently used during clothing factory production. You may choose to buy this clothing instead of spraying your own clothing with permethrin. It is EPA-approved as safe for everyone, including children, to wear, and kills and repels bugs. "
"
Seal off your house.,
Place nets over outdoor or exterior areas.,
Drive gnats away with fans.,
Grow plants that repel gnats.",How to Avoid Gnat Bites4," Gnats can often be a problem while you are inside. If they are in your house, make sure that you close all your doors and windows.


Seal any unnecessary openings. If necessary, use tape or chalk to close gaps under door frames or around window edges. You can use silicone caulk to seal cracks and crevices in baseboards, cupboards, sinks, electrical outlets and so on. You may want to buy a caulking gun to make this process easier.
Install screens on the outside of your windows, doors, and heating and cooling vents that are small enough that gnats can not get through. Charcoal fiberglass screens work best. Remove anything around the exterior that may attract gnats. Stacked firewood, leaves, debris, garbage, and standing water can all attract gnats. Keep these at least 18 inches from the exterior of the house., Loose garden netting can be used to cover an outdoor dinner table or a camping tent. Or you can buy removable screens to cover porch or deck areas. use staples or splines to keep them in place., A good short-term solution is to keep air circulating in the area where you are. Fans will drive gnats away, and the airflow prevents them from landing on and biting you. This is a good short-term solution for either indoors or outdoors.

, A variety of common garden plants and flowers contain elements that are likely to repel gnats. These include geraniums, lemon thyme, lavender, and Mexican marigolds.Geranium flowers contain citronella, which appears to strongly repel gnats and is a common ingredient in commercial repellents. Grow geraniums in hanging planters on your porch or patio to repel gnats.Lemon thyme is a perennial herb with leaves that contain citronella. You can grow it in your garden in the sun.
Lavender has a scent that is pleasant to humans but very unpleasant to gnats. You can grow in the ground or in a pot.
Mexican marigolds have a musty smell the drives away gnats and other flying insects. Grow in your garden in full sunlight.

Identify the bear quickly upon your encounter.,
Try to quickly assess whether the bear before you is behaving defensively or is attacking you to clear her path to food (predatory).,
Regardless of whether you're being attacked for predatory or defensive reasons, a bear is dangerous when he decides to attack.,
Deal with a bear charge as calmly as possible.,
Know when it's okay to play dead and when it's not.,
Exploit possible bear weaknesses.,
Fight with whatever you have.,
Pull out your pepper spray and use it.,
Consider the involvement of those accompanying you.,
Escape as soon as it's safe to do so.,
Be realistic.",How to Survive a Bear Attack," Knowing your bear has some bearing on how to approach an attack. Keep in mind that color and size are not reliable sole indicators of the species of bear––even those familiar with bears can have a difficult time determining the difference between a very large black bear and a grizzly. Common features of some species of bears include:


Black bears (Ursus americanus): Black bears can weigh between 125 to 660 pounds (56kg to 300kg).The color of black bears tends to range from black to blond. The bear's muzzle is usually lighter in color than the bear's body; many black bears will also sport a white patch on their throat or chest. The black bear stands about 2-3.5 feet (60-100cm) tall to the shoulder and 4-7 feet (1.2-2.1 meters) tall when standing on his back legs. Look for such distinguishing features as a straight face, a straight back line, small head and dark-colored short claws.Brown bears (sub-species ""Grizzly"" bears) (Ursus arctos and Ursus arctos horribilis): Brown bears are distributed across Eurasia and North America. They weigh between 660 and 1500 pounds (300 to 680kg), with the Kodiak bear being the largest (rivaling the polar bear in size).There is debate about the amount of sub-species of brown bears but you can generally rely on the distinguishing features noted below. Grizzly bears can weigh about 550-1000 pounds (250-450 kg) in interior areas, while coastal grizzlies can weigh up to 1500 pounds at peak.().Again, the coloring can be anywhere from black to blond, with the usual giveaway being that the bear has silver-tipped fur that looks ""grizzled"" (or ""streaked with gray hair"", hence the name ""grizzly""). When standing, a grizzly can reach over 9 to 12 feet (2.74 to 3.657 meters) tall. In brown, grizzly and Kodiak bears, look for such distinguishing features as a prominent hump over his shoulders, sloping back line, a dished or concave face, large head and light-colored, long curving claws.Sloth bears (""Melursus ursinus""): Sloth bears are a nocturnal insectivorous species of bear found wild within the Indian subcontinent. Sloth bears have shaggy, dusty-black coats, pale, short-haired muzzles, and long, curved claws that they use to excavate ants and termites. A cream-colored ""V"" or ""Y"" usually marks their chests. Sloth bears' nostrils can close, protecting the animals from dust or insects when raiding termite nests or bee hives. A gap in their teeth enables them to suck up ants, termites, and other insects. Sloth bears grow five to six feet long, stand two to three feet high at the shoulder, and weigh from 120 (in lighter females) to 310 pounds (in heavy males).
Polar bears (Ursus maritimis): Male polar bears can weigh around 770-1500 pounds (350-680kg), with females being about half the size.Found in the Arctic Circle, this bear has adjusted to life on snow, ice and in cold waters. The largest terrestrial carnivore, the polar bear's shoulder height is about 51-63 inches (130-160cm). The usual color is white and the bear's body is more elongated than that of a brown bear, with a longer skull and nose.
For locations of different bear species, see ""Tips"" below.;
, This is helpful for knowing how far you can rely on trying to convince the bear you're not a threat so she will leave you alone (by, for example, increasing your size, being noisy, playing dead, etc.). On the other hand, if you're viewed as prey rather than as a threat, the bear won't stop attacking you if you play dead or shout, so you'll need to find more effective defensive approaches that might help you to escape safely. Typical reasons for a bear to feel threatened include the need to protect her cubs, protection of hidden food or a carcass and surprise or confusion, fear, an impression that her space has been invaded and blocking of her exit way. Predatory behavior is usually brought about by hunger and an indifference to your human status. A greater percentage of attacks from black bears are predatory in nature than from brown bears but young brown bears or grizzlies can be predatory once abandoned by their mothers, as they're learning to find food alone and it's may be tempting to see humans as food. Remember that whatever the reason behind a bear's attack, the bear is dangerous. Here are some general indications showing whether the bear is reacting either in a defensive or predatory way:Black bear defensive attack: The bear that is defending herself will tend to swat at you and try to bite. However, she is less likely to target your head or neck (the kill bite).
Black bear predatory attack: The bear that is hungry will often ""find you"" and may have stalked you. She will go for biting the nape and the top of your head. She will grasp you with a ""bear hug"" while she bites you. She won't be deterred from continuing to attack you.
Brown/grizzly bear defensive attack: The bear may flee or she may make a series of bluff charges to test your threat. The intended ferocity of her attack can be determined by looking at the position of her ears. The more her ears slope backwards, the more serious her intention to attack. Other indicators of an attack about to occur include hair rising on the back of her neck and back and growls. Be aware that if she runs downwind, it may signal her need to get a better smell of the intruder. When she attacks you, she'll bite the top of your head and the nape and smash your spinal cord with a powerful paw swipe.
Brown/grizzly bear predatory attack: The same indicators as the defensive attack, with increased seriousness of her intention (for example, bluff charges turn into standing her ground and trying to swipe or bite you). If she is on all four legs, aggression will be shown in the form of swinging her head from side to side and clacking her teeth while opening and closing her mouth.
Sloth bear: Sloth bears mostly feed exclusively on plants, so it's probably attacking you to defend itself or it's cubs. It will usually try to smack you and bite you, but will probably not target your head or neck.
Polar bear: Polar bears are usually hungry and are dangerous. It has been known for centuries that they attack humans and they can stalk a human being for ages. They will bite you in the head.Assume the attack is predatory and that the bear won't stop attacking you.
Any species of bear in your camp or worse, in your tent: This bear, regardless of species, is most likely predatory and you need to act fast to defend yourself physically. Do not act like prey––stay calm and fight back with everything (and everyone) in the tent. If you notice a bear watching your campsite, contact the relevant authorities immediately.

, However, the number one coping mechanism is to keep a clear head, so above all, don't panic. If you panic, your mind will go blank and you may react like a prey animal, purely from fear, which can endanger your life. Some key things to help you initially include:


Try to make yourself appear bigger than you really are. Hold your arms up above your head and perhaps spread your legs a little more widely apart (but not so as to unbalance yourself). You could also raise your jacket above your head to give the impression of greater height but decide realize that this may mean less protection on your body should the bear suddenly attack you and you can't put it back on quickly enough. Don't use your jacket if it means removing a backpack (see next).
If wearing a backpack, leave it on. It's slightly more protection than without one, especially if you need to ""play dead"" (see next step).
Avoid making any eye contact––eye contact can be perceived by a bear as a threat and can provoke a charge or repeated attacks. By the same token, never take your eyes off the bear in general––know what he is doing at all times.
Noise may or may not make things worse. Small bears, including black bears, can be scared away with noise. Some people believe metallic noise scares off bears because it's ""not natural"" and there are documented examples of bears running away from clanging metallic sounds.However, any noise may be effective if it's going to work at all. Be aware that larger bears, including large black bears and polar bears, are often simply made more curious by noise in this situation and could well come towards the noise (i.e., you) to check it out.
At night, use a strong flashlight or headlamp to shine lights in the bear's eyes, especially if a bear surprises you in your camp or tent. Even a camera flash can temporarily blind a bear in poor light or the dark.
Avoid any sudden movements and never run. Animals that chase prey for a living react to movement and running trips an innate reaction to give chase until caught. A bear is able to run over 40 mph (64 km/h), so don't harbor notions of outrunning the bear!
Equally, never hide in something as flimsy as a tent. The bear won't be fooled into thinking you've disappeared and scuttling off to hide may well trigger the predator instinct to keep foraging for you.
The common advice about climbing a tree is––don't. This is because bears (especially black and sloth bears) can climb trees very fast. Climbing a tree though, might increase your chances of survival if fighting a larger bear, like a grizzly bear. But some grizzlies can climb, too. It can also be useful where a bear is bluff charging, as it can indicate to the bear that you're not a threat. But if you do climb a tree, make sure the bear is not strong enough to make the tree fall over, and that you have sufficient time to climb high enough that the bear cannot get to you if he stands on his hind legs (which he can do rapidly). However, if you're attacked by a black/sloth bear (unless he's very big) or a smaller bear, don't climb a tree, as they can climb very easily. In this latter case, if you do find yourself forced to climb a tree, climb very high to a point where even a small 300 pound bear cannot go without snapping the branches.
Try to create some distance between you and the bear––distance is your ally while you defend yourself. Barehanded, you lack a safe enough reach to harm the bear without him harming you even more rapidly. Do your best to put something large in between you and the bear, like a tree or a rock.

, Some charges are tests or bluffs to see what you'll do, if anything.Even though it's hard, try to stand perfectly still and stand your ground when a bear is charging you.Some bears will be nonplussed by the lack of movement and stop considering you as a threat. However, do be readying yourself for an attack, such as preparing pepper spray or sticks, etc. during the charge. Don't use the spray or hit the bear unless you are sure the bear is attacking––some bears make several bluff charges before deciding you're not worth the effort and you wouldn't want to unnecessarily arouse the bear's wrath when she might just simply grow bored and wander off again.


After a bluff charge, talk softly, wave your hands slowly above your head and back away slowly.Note that if a bear rears up on her hind legs––this is often an attempt to see what is happening rather than an immediate launch into an attack. Stay still and let her assess you; she may find you unworthy of further interest.
A grizzly will tend to make a direct charge, while a black bear may zig zag charge to attack from undercover. Above all, do not run or you will trigger the bear's instincts to give chase. Naturally, being surprised by a stealth charging bear can make this easier said than done, so always be alert when in bear country.

, If the bear maintains too much interest in potentially or actually attacking you, playing dead may be an option if you're confronted by a brown bear or a grizzly. If you're certain that this is the species of bear before you, to play dead, simply drop to the ground and lie flat on your stomach. Spread your legs out (to prevent the bear from rolling you over easily) and cover the nape with your hands, locking your fingers together. Use your elbows to cover your face. Stay very still and silent. Steve French, a doctor familiar with bear attack injuries, noted that victims attacked in a close encounter situation who protect themselves in this manner and don't resist, tend to survive with outpatient injuries only.If the bear does manage to roll you over, roll back onto your stomach again, each time. The hope is that the brown bear or grizzly will eventually grow bored with you and leave. If the bear does seem to leave, remain playing dead for some time until you can be absolutely sure the bear has really left and isn't just waiting for your revival.On the other hand, many bear experts recommend that you should never play dead if the bear is a black bear. (Nor with a polar bear.) In doing so, you might be giving yourself up for dinner. However, not all bear experts agree that playing dead doesn't work with black bears and author of Bear Aware, Bill Schneider"", suggests that if you can't identify the bear, it's still best to play dead.If the brown bear or grizzly roughs you up a bit, stay flat and silent. However, if he starts to lick your wounds, stop playing dead; the bear is getting serious about harming (eating) you and you'll need to fight back.

, There are a few things that you can try to do that might lessen the bear's chances of successfully attacking you. First, try to defend yourself on a steep slope or grade; in doing so, you can ensure that any bear will at least have a difficult time standing erect, thereby reducing his full weight force (from a standing position, a bear can benefit merely from using his own weight to harm you). Note that attacks from the side may be difficult for the bear to see well (bears' neck muscles and jaw structure make it difficult for them to rotate their necks easily, limiting their viewing range from the side), so you might be able to take advantage of this if it comes to blows. However, be aware that a bear will likely attack horizontally as well, which can inhibit your own horizontal strikes.


Bears, as far as scientists can determine, have as good eyesight as humans. While this may deteriorate with age (as with humans), don't rely on alleged poor eyesight as a defense method (namely, don't play hide and seek in full view of the bear)., If you've tried everything else and the bear is still bearing down on you, your life is in severe danger and you'll need to do whatever you can to survive. Reach for whatever you can to fight with. Sticks, dirt, rocks, etc. can be thrown into the bear's eyes, poked into his eyes, or can be used to hit him across the snout (a very sensitive part of a bear). Just take care when retrieving such objects, as you will probably be tempted to squat or bend over, which can make you appear even smaller and you might lose sight of the bear's actions as you're picking up the items. When defending yourself, keep in your head that for any defense against the bear to work, you must be quick, you must try to increase your distance, be aggressive and you must try to avoid the bear's strength (the power of the bear's strike), in that order of importance.


Do a straight-line/gut kick if you have to/can. Straight line kicks can be effective––this is the kind of kick performed by police when breaching a door. Strike quickly and draw your leg back fast before the bear has a chance to swipe your inner thigh (if the bear manages to do so, you're effectively disarmed). If on a hill though, realize that if the bear is lower than you, he will lead his attack with his head because of the difficulties of standing, so you'll need to aim the kick accordingly.
A bear's neck, skull and rigid jaw muscles can be used as resistance. If done correctly, a kick landed on the face may cause hemorrhage due to the bear's resistance, potentially causing whiplash.
If punching a bear, be aware of how useless this can be and how it can endanger you a great deal. A punch usually only works when landed squarely on the bear's nose.Where possible, avoid punching because it exposes your very vulnerable arms and hands.
Where you can, strike and move uphill, strike and move uphill. Staying uphill may give you more of a chance to inflict enough damage to the bear to give you a chance to escape.
Protect yourself above all. Be aware that you can't take a strike. The large swipes from a bear have been known to kill elk and deer in one movement; you will likely fare no differently. Use your backpack as a shield, throw things at the bear, like your pack, camera, books, shoes and drink bottle; preferably aim for sensitive areas of the bear's face, such as the nose or eyes.
If you have hit the bear or caused him pain, recognize that the bear will see you as a continuing threat. He will either run away or continue his assault until he has removed his perceived threat.

, This step is set apart from the previous one because you may not have any spray (not everyone agrees with lugging around what is effectively a chemical weapon requiring careful handling and that comes with a hefty price and deteriorates quickly) and also because you do need to know how to use it properly for it to be effective. The first thing is to understand that pepper spray is a deterrent only and may increase a bear's anger, so don't treat it as your only response to an attacking bear. Second, pepper spray needs to be accessible. If it's tucked at the base of your backpack, you won't have time to retrieve it. Only use it if you can get it quickly and easily––the speed of your reaction matters when using pepper spray.


Use pepper spray at the moment of the attack.
Know the range of the pepper spray you have (it's usually 20 to 30 feet/6-9 meters). Hopefully you've got a big container with a good range, to help keep distance between you and the bear.
Check the wind direction. It won't do you any good to spray the bear only to have the spray fog you instead. If the wind is blowing toward you, you'll need to carefully get to a better position. Also, if it's raining heavily, the spray may not be effective as it'll wash off quickly.
Follow the manufacturer's instructions. You need to read the instructions before you go into bear country. You will not have time to be reading them with a bear dancing around you. Different spray brands may work differently, or new containers may have different requirements from what you're used to, and you need to know this in advance.
Aim the pepper spray at the bear so that it will form a fog or cone cloud in the precise place where the bear is aiming to attack. Spray as soon as the bear charging you is about 40 feet (12 meters) toward you, in expectation of the bear's arrival and yell at the same time.Expect a reaction––the bear will experience immediate, intense pain from stinging eyes and will probably experience breathing difficulties. An angry disoriented bear will probably still come after you, so don't delay if the spray has given you a chance to get away.
If you forgot the pepper spray, use any repellent you have; even insect repellent might cause stinging eyes in a pinch. However, don't rely on any other form of repellent than pepper spray as your anti-bear arsenal because they generally do not make any impact at all; use of them is a last ditch desperate act.

, Dealing with an attacking bear when in a group deserves mention. Choosing to hike, jog, run, camp, or spend time in bear country alone isn't necessarily wise because there is often safety in numbers. This is why many national/state/provincial park authorities in both the USA and Canada recommend that some trails can only be taken when in a group of six or more people. If you're confronted by a bear that wants to attack you and you're with companions, they can play a vital role in scaring off the bear. More people means more noise and an impression of too many attackers versus the bear will often put an end to any thoughts of an attack. If there are only a few of you together, say two or three, the bear may not be as intimidated and may still seek to attack. However, the advantage of being with companions is that you can defend each other. For example, if you all drop down and play dead and the bear paws one of you, the other companion can start poking the bear's eyes and spraying the bear to get him to move away. If a bear is attacking you and you're with other people able to help responsibly, try the following:


Keep communicating clearly with companions when attacked by a bear. Tell each other what you're about to do as both reassurance and certainty of actions. Stay calm and try not to shout unless it's part of your noise strategy.
Avoid leaving any person alone with the bear. The strategy should be to stick together as much as possibly, to help increase the impression of a group that is hard to part. Avoid leaving alone any individual who could be singled out for attacking.
One person can collect sticks, dirt, etc. while the other person shouts at the bear to distract him.
In particular, protect young or vulnerable people. Do your best to shield children or panicking persons who form part of your group. Keep them close so that the bear doesn't perceive them as an easy pick and do your best to reassure them to dampen down fear or panic reactions.

, As stated earlier, don't ever run. If you've wounded a bear enough to stop her in her tracks temporarily, walk away as fast as you can, heading in a direction away from her and toward safety. Keep something defensive in your hands, such as dirt, pepper spray, sticks, etc., in case you need to resort to defending yourself again in an instant. Try to move away noiselessly so as not to attract any more attention. It's probable that you will be in shock but do what you can to get back to a safe place.


Whenever backing away from a bear, do so facing the bear so that you can continue to watch the bear. Speak in a low monotone, as if to reassure the bear (and probably yourself).
If you're in the Arctic, try to get back to a vehicle or shelter where possible. Unfortunately, you remain a clear target while exposed against the vast tracts of snow. Moreover, a polar bear has a keen sense of smell (they can find a buried seal pup up to 2 kilometers away!).

, The suggestions in this article are just that––suggestions. There is no one checklist for surviving a bear attack and what is provided here are generalizations drawn from a variety of sources based on people's own bear encounter experiences. None of these approaches are guarantees of survival in a future bear encounter, as how a bear will react depends largely on the context, on how you (and any companions with you) react and the bear's own reasons, which will only become apparent as your personal bear encounter unfolds. Moreover, bears are very strong. Nevertheless, knowing how other people have survived informs you that it is possible to survive a bear encounter. Above all, always be prepared and seek to stay calm; being in bear country carries responsibilities of which you should be aware before entering.


Keep bear fear in perspective; after reading an article like this, you might think bears are out to get you. On the whole, they are not, testified to by the fact that bears have ample opportunities to attack human beings that they don't choose to act upon. Bears co-exist peacefully in most areas and the few rogue bears that cause problems are usually swiftly dealt with by the relevant authorities. You can help peaceful coexistence with bears by not feeding them (to avoid food-conditioning), not encouraging them into your living space, not provoking them and by spreading the message about how to stay safe around bears. Prevention works better than cure––always follow the ways of avoiding encounters with bears or backing down well before it turns into an attack. Remember that most bears will avoid confrontation where possible.

Treat the animal promptly.,
Take the animal to a veterinarian if possible.,
Have one or more assistants restrain the animal.,
Check all over the animal for quill location.,
Keep the animal as relaxed as possible.,
Never cut the quills before removing.,
Grasp a quill near the base with pliers or hemostats.,
Pull the quill out quickly in the opposite direction the quill entered.,
If the quill tip breaks, remove it with sanitized tweezers.,
Repeat with all remaining quills.,
Bandage or disinfectant quill wounds depending on location.,
Have your animal get a rabies vaccine.,
Look for signs of complications over the next few weeks.",How to Remove Porcupine Quills1," Porcupine quills are much less likely to cause lasting harm if they are removed from the animal within the first 24 hours.Animals that are treated during that period almost always make a full recovery. Delayed treatment, on the other hand, increases the chance of complications such as broken quill tips, eye or joint damage, and infection. Dogs that have quills in their mouth region may not be able to eat until they are removed.


Many veterinary hospitals accept after-hours patients for emergencies.
If you cannot treat the animal immediately, try to keep it from pawing at or breaking the quills. Restrain it to minimize any movement if the quills are in its chest or abdomen, where breakage is most dangerous.;
, Removing quills from an animal at home is a painful process, and even a gentle animal will struggle. If the animal is pierced with 10 or more quills, has quills embedded near the mouth or eyes, or has a tendency toward aggressive behavior, make an effort to find a veterinarian. Only attempt home removal in these situations as a last resort.


If quills are embedded in or around the eye, removing them yourself is dangerous. Broken quill tips in the eye may require medical equipment to locate and can cause serious damage.If quills are embedded around the mouth, the animal may have quills embedded in the mouth or throat. These are difficult to locate and remove at home, and could interfere with your animal's ability to eat until removed by a veterinarian., Unless the animal is small and unusually calm, you should have a friend hold it in place. Choose someone the dog is comfortable with, if possible, to further minimize stress and struggling. Struggle during quill removal can cause the tips to break off and dig deeper into the animal, where you cannot reach them.



Do not muzzle the animal unless there are no quills in or around its face, as the muzzle could break quills or push them in further. Almost all dogs injured by quills have quills in this area, often in addition to other locations, so check thoroughly for puncture marks or small quills in the mouth and face before you assume muzzling is safe., The majority of animals with embedded quills are injured in multiple locations, and some quills may be small and difficult to see.The animal's efforts to remove the quills itself may cause them to transfer into the animal's paws as well, or the porcupine could have struck the animal multiple times.


Check inside the mouth, using a flashlight to see the back palate and throat. If there are quills located here, a veterinarian can remove them without nearly as much pain to the dog.
Check on and between its footpads, and along its paws and legs.
While quills on the chest or stomach are much less common than in other locations, you should still check for small quills and tender lumps under the skin here, as broken quill tips in this region can be dangerous.

, Move slowly and speak softly to keep the dog as relaxed as possible, although you should be ready to dodge a bite. Before removing quills from the animal's face, cover its eyes with your hand or have an assistant the animal trusts do the same., You may have heard or read advice about cutting the porcupine quill in half so it deflates and is easier to remove. Do not follow this advice: it can actually make the quills more difficult to grab on to, or even splinter them into several broken pieces., Use a pair of flat-jawed pliers that can firmly grasp the base of the quill, next to the skin.You may have to switch to smaller or needle-nosed pliers to remove the smallest quills. Hemostats, or small medical pliers intended for clamping, are an excellent choice if available.


Grasp firmly, but not hard enough to break the quill.
Do not grasp the quills with your fingers. They are covered tiny barbs and scales which will cause pain and injury to your skin.

, Keeping a firm grip on the quill base, pull in as straight a line as possible. Try to slide the quill out of the hole directly, rather than angling it where it could cause new damage or break inside the animal.


Quill removal is much less painful when done with a rapid motion.You should be sure you have a firm grip on the quill and are aiming to pull in the right direction before you yank the quill, however.

, Look at the base of the quill you removed to make sure the tip is still present. If the tip has broken off, it could cause infection or even travel to the animal's organs.You will need to sanitize a pair of tweezers and attempt to remove it.


To sanitize metal tweezers, rinse them in running water, then drop them in a pot of boiling water for five minutes. Remove carefully with tongs, place on a clean paper towel, and let cool for a few minutes before handling.
If you cannot see the quill tip in the puncture wound, or you fail to remove it after one or two attempts, take your dog to a veterinarian immediately.

, Grasp each quill one at a time next to the skin. Pull it out firmly and quickly to minimize pain. Always pull straight in the opposite direction it entered, never at an angle. Check the tip after each quill is removed to make sure it hasn't broken inside the animal.


Check the animal again for quills you may have missed. It's always best to be certain, as removing the quill right away leads to faster, safer recovery.

, Only bandage or wrap the quill wounds if they are on the animal's chest or causing a significant amount of blood.Other wounds should be left open to the air so you can keep an eye out for infection, but you should dab disinfectant or antiseptic on these to reduce the risk of infection. Do not disinfect chest wounds.


Dip a cotton ball in hydrogen peroxide for an easy tool for cleaning wounds., While chances of a rabies infection are quite low, the disease is fatal, so don't skip this step. Any warm-blooded animal can contract rabies, including cats, dogs, birds, horses, and livestock.Your local doctor or veterinarian should know whether rabies is in your area, and be able to administer a vaccine.


Mammals such as dogs and cats can not only contract rabies, but pass it on to humans. Ask your doctor whether a rabies vaccine for yourself is required, especially if you didn't get your animal a vaccine immediately.
Even if your pet received a vaccine in the last three years, ask a doctor whether it would be wise to receive another one after possible exposure.

, If the animal is still in pain after a week or if it shows signs of infection, take it to a veterinarian immediately. Red or swollen areas, oozing pus, or skin that is warm to the touch may indicate infection.


If the animal limps or has tender, painful joints, you should take your animal to a veterinarian. Quills may be lodged deep inside its body.
If the animal had quills in its mouth or throat, feed it soft food for a few days until it recovers.
A veterinarian may decide to prescribe antibiotics if infection is present. At home, do not attempt to give your animal anything stronger than an over-the-counter antibiotic lotion without the advice of a veterinarian.

Go to a doctor for serious cases.,
Ask the person to remain calm and still.,
Never cut the quills before removal.,
Approach the first quill with a pair of flat head pliers or hemostats.,
Clasp the quill near the base.,
Pull the quill out smoothly.,
Scan the area where the quill was buried to ensure that the tip has not broken off.,
Repeat the removal process for every quill you can locate.,
Disinfect the wounds.,
Apply antibiotic ointment to the wounds.,
Monitor the wound every day for signs of infection.,
Ask a doctor about a rabies vaccine as soon as possible.",How to Remove Porcupine Quills2," If there is a large number of quills, the experience will be much less painful when performed by a doctor. Do not attempt to remove quills on a person's face or throat at home.

, The removal process is painful and requires the patient to sit still for a long period of time while quills are extracted. Remove the quills as soon as possible after the injury occurs.


If the injured person struggles, there is risk that the quill tip may break off and lodge deeper in the skin, which risks causing serious problems. Take the person to a doctor if the person will not remain still.

, Many people cut the hollow quill before removing so that it deflates and become smaller. Professionals, however, advise not to do this, as it can make the quill harder to grasp and could cause it to break apart into several splinters.

, You may need pliers of different sizes if there are both small and large quills present. Quills require tools for removal because they have barbed ends along their surfaces which make them easy to stick into an object but difficult to remove in the opposite direction. If you attempt to pull quills by hand they will burrow into your fingers.

, Use the tool to grab the quill as near to the skin as possible. You could even push the skin down around the quill, as long as you are careful not to break the quill or cause too much pain to the injured person.

, Use a powerful, rapid motion to pull the quill out as firmly and quickly as possible. Do not twist the quill, which can cause breakage. Try to pull it out at the same angle it entered, directly backward out of the wound.

, Broken quills can embed themselves into the skin and cause infection. See a doctor if this occurs.


If you are not able to visit a doctor, sanitize a pair of clean (dirt-free) tweezers by putting them in boiling water for five minutes. Remove the tweezers from the water with tongs and let cool on a clean paper towel for a few minutes before you use them to remove the broken quill tip inside the wound.

, Ask the patient if they have any pains elsewhere on their body, which could indicate smaller quills or broken off quill tips neither of you noticed. Remove quill tips as described above.

, Dip a cotton ball in hydrogen peroxide and wipe the wounds clean with it.Sterile alcohol pads found in first aid kits will also work. Use mild soap and water if nothing else is available.

, You may wish to apply a bandage over the ointment to hold it in place if the injured person will be participating in energetic activities, or if he or she is likely to scratch at the wound. Otherwise, keep the region open (without a bandage) so you can watch for infection.

, Possible infection can appear as redness, swelling and oozing pus. You should visit a doctor if this occurs so you can be prescribed a safe and effective antibiotic to fight off the infection.


If the person has any unexplained pains in the next few weeks, take them to a doctor and mention the porcupine quill incident. There's a possibility a quill tip remains lodged under the skin or has traveled deeper into the body where it can cause serious damage.

, While rabies is mostly transmitted through bites, you should not take any risks. If someone is unlucky enough to pick up the rabies virus from a porcupine and did not receive a prompt vaccine or a vaccine in the recent past, there is a high chance of death.


Even if the injured person received a vaccine in the last three years, ask a doctor whether it would be wise to receive another one after possible exposure.

Do not assume your animal will learn to avoid porcupines.,
Identify possible porcupine dens.,
If you encounter a porcupine, back away slowly.,
Know when porcupines are active.,
Call professional porcupine removers to remove porcupines on your property.",How to Remove Porcupine Quills3," Many dogs and other animals end up injuring themselves with porcupine encounters two or more times. If your pet has been injured by a porcupine once in your area, it is likely to encounter one again and may provoke it again.

, Porcupines live in small, enclosed spaces. Caves, spaces underneath logs, or rockfalls may contain porcupines. Keep your animal leashed when passing by this type of area, or call it back if it goes to investigate these. If someone encountered porcupines near your house, they may be living underneath a deck, in a crawlspace, or in the corner of a shed.A porcupine's den may be easy to discover if you follow the sound of strange barks, grunts, moans, or screams. These sounds are most common during the autumn mating season., Contrary to myth, porcupines are not aggressive and are not able to throw their quills. As long as you back away slowly, the porcupine should not harm you. Look around as you back up to make sure there are no other porcupines around. While they are usually solitary, you may find mothers with young or multiple porcupines sharing a den in the winter., Porcupines typically sleep during the day, so your animals have little risk of encountering them during that time. Keep your animals indoors or in pens during the night. If you want to spot the porcupines yourself to confirm they are on your property, you may need a flashlight or night vision goggles. Stay well away from the suspected den.

, Besides the possibility of injury, porcupines will eat wood and garden plants, causing major damage.Call Wildlife Control or professional pet removers and have them safely remove the porcupines.


Do not attempt to drive the porcupines away yourself, as you could be seriously injured.

Keep yourself safe.,
Defend yourself if you are actively being attacked.,
Warn others you come across that there is an aggressive dog in the area.,
Call the Emergency Services, or your local emergency number, if you or someone else is in danger.,
Locate the number for your local animal shelter or humane society if the dog is being aggressive.,
Call and make your report.,
Stay on the line if requested.",How to Report a Dangerous Dog," If you come across an aggressive dog, particularly an unattended stray, the best thing to do is to slowly back away from it before you get too close. Aggressive dogs do not like you to enter their area, so don't be tempted to try to calm it down by moving towards it.


If you run, the dog may go after you and attack. Keep calm, avoid strong eye contact, and do not enter their space.Be sure that you don't stop backing away from an aggressive dog until you are a safe distance away. Once you are far enough away, turn and walk away.
Don't assume that a dog is aggressive purely due to its breed. Aggressiveness is most often due to training, or lack of training, or abuse, not due to ingrained attributes of a breed.;
, Protect your face and other sensitive areas of your body such as your neck and chest.If you are on the ground try to curl up in a ball and wrap your hands around the back of your neck to protect it.Try to get the dog to attack something other than your body. If you have a sweater or a bag, try to get the dog to attack that instead., This is especially important if you see children walking in the direction of the dog.

, If a person is being attacked, they will probably need medical attention. The police will also need to assess the situation if the attack is severe enough.


This does not mean that you should call the Emergency Services if you are nipped or barked at by a dog. However, you should call the police if you, or someone else, is experiencing severe physical harm. In some cases dog attacks can be very serious and cause injury or death.
If you have been bitten but are in no danger of further immediate injury you may want to call your local non-emergency police number. They can connect you to the police unit that deals with crimes involving animals, if there is one in your area., You can find this number by searching in your telephone book, online, or by calling local directory assistance.


Your community may also have an animal control department. If you have one, and the dog is severely aggressive, it may be best to find their number. They may be able to get to the scene more quickly than animal shelter or humane society personnel.
If you are in a rural area you may need to get the number of the sheriff, as other options may not be available.If you're a child, tell an adult right away so that they can make the call.

, Be prepared to describe the dog's physical characteristics and location. You may be asked for your phone number as well, so that responders can call you for more details. The authorities on the phone should tell you what to do next and those responding will take care of the dog as quickly, and humanely, as they can.


Report the dog as soon as possible so that the animal control authorities can locate it before it gets far from where you saw it.

, It may be the case that the animal is traveling away from the location you reported. While your first priority should be your own safety, it may be helpful for you to keep an eye on where the dog is going, especially if it traveling quickly.

Get familiar with piranha territory.,
Avoid swimming with piranhas in the dry season.Piranhas are usually mild-mannered and skittish.,
Wait until night to enter the water.,
Stay out of the water if you have an open, bleeding cut.,
Avoid making a fuss.,
Create a diversion.",How to Safely Swim with Piranhas," Piranhas are freshwater fish and live only in South America (although occasionally a stray pet piranha turns up in a river elsewhere). Residing almost exclusively in still or slow-moving streams or lakes, they usually die in cold water.;
, They rarely, if ever, attack a much larger animal unless they are starving. Food supplies are at their lowest during the dry season (which lasts from around April to September), when water levels fall dramatically and food is less plentiful, so avoid entering piranha-infested waters during these times.


If you're in doubt about whether the dry season is still underway, ask local residents if it's safe to swim.
Be wary of ponds that seem to be a product of the movements of a river. Rivers slowly move back and forth and often shrink and grow with the rain, leaving temporary ponds behind. Fish in these waters are isolated from other water sources and are essentially condemned to death; they could jump and attack you out of sheer desperation if you stand close enough.

, If, during the dry season, you must venture into water inhabited by piranhas, wait until darkness before attempting to traverse without a boat. Piranhas hunt in the day and sleep at night.


If awakened from their slumber while it's dark, piranhas will generally flee, but it's safest not to disturb them.
Remember that other predators, such as caimans, are more active at night. If attempting to cross a waterway with a diversity of organisms, the dangers of traveling at night may far outweigh the benefits.

, Piranhas sense blood in the water and are more likely to attack a larger animal if they think it's wounded.


You should also avoid carrying raw meat into the water, and wash your hands before entering if you have recently handled raw meat. (Don't wash where piranhas reside).
Steer clear of waters below bird nesting areas, docks where fish are gutted, and garbage dumps; you don't want the piranhas to associate you with the blood that could come from these sources.

, Recent studies suggest that desperate piranhas are attracted more by activity than by blood. When crossing water, minimize your movement and swim or walk with smooth, fluid motions. Avoid talking, and don't use flashlights or lanterns when night-crossing.

, As a last-ditch effort, try to create a diversion by releasing an animal carcass or a substantial quantity of raw meat downstream from your desired crossing point. Should such action become necessary, keep in mind that piranhas can strip animals to the bone in a matter of minutes or even seconds, so you'll want to cross very quickly before they sense you.

Remove the tick from its host, if necessary.,
Confirm that it's a tick.,
Examine the tick's ""scutum,"" or shield.",How to Identify a Deer Tick1," The best way to remove the tick is to use pointy-edged tweezers, angling the points to ensure that the head of the tick is removed along with the body.Old-fashioned methods, such as soaking it with petroleum jelly or painted the affected site with nail polish, should be avoided as they traumatize the tick, which may then regurgitate its stomach contents (including bacteria) into the dog's bloodstream.


Did you remove the whole tick? If you've jerked or twisted the tick while removing it, the mouth-parts may break off and remain in the skin. You may be able to remove the mouth-parts separately using clean tweezers.You should still be able to identify the tick without the mouth-parts.
Put the tick in a vial or lidded jar, or place it on a piece of white paper and use a piece of clear tape to cover it.;
, How many legs does it have? Ticks, like other arachnids, will have eight legs in the nymph and adult stage, but will have only six legs in the larval stage.If you've put the tick in a jar or vial, watch it move. If it is a tick, it will crawl, but will not be able to fly or jump.
Ticks have flattened, tear-shaped bodies at all stages of growth. When engorged, the tick's body will be rounded and its color will be lighter.
Deer ticks are smaller than their counterparts, the dog and lone star ticks. Deer tick nymphs are typically the size of a poppy seed, 1 to 2 mm (.039 to .078 inches) in diameter, while adults range from 2 to 3.5 mm (.078 to .137 inches) and are roughly the size of a sesame seed. An engorged tick may be about 10 mm long.Hard ticks, such as the deer tick, have a scutum or shield covering the body.Soft ticks do not have this feature., A magnifying glass can be helpful, as ticks in pre-adult stages are quite small.


The scutum is the hard section behind the tick's head. A deer tick will have a solid-color scutum, while the shield of other ticks is patterned.The scutum can also provide information about the gender of the tick.The scutum of the adult male will cover most of the body, while that of the female will be much smaller.
If the tick is engorged (after feeding) it can be hard to identify by other characteristics. An engorged deer tick will be rust- or brown-red in color, while the color of other engorged ticks may be pale gray or greenish-gray.However, the scutum will remain unchanged.

Prepare a lavender soap.,
Dab a lavender oil moisturizer on your skin.,
Try lavender and apple cider vinegar.,
Purchase or make lavender sachets or pillows.,
Mix a lavender spray.,
Rub lavender flowers on your skin.,
Plant lavender in your garden.,
Leave saucers of lavender oil in strategic places.",How to Make a Lavender Insect Repellent1," Make soap out of lavender essential oil. Washing your body with the soap can deter bugs from attacking you.Purchase a plain liquid Castile soap and lavender essential oil, both of which you can purchase at many health stores and large retailers.Add 10-15 drops of essential oil to the Castile soap and mix well.Wash with the soap either every day or before you go outside.;
, Apply a small amount of lavender essential oil to your skin, or even that of your pet. This may be all you need to keep insects away from yourself.Use a carrier oil to dilute the essential oil so that it doesn’t irritate your skin. Examples of carrier oils include sweet almond oil, apricot kernel oil, avocado oil, olive oil, and sesame oil.Put 1-2 drops of lavender essential oil into each ounce of carrier oil you use.You can increase this amount as you tolerate it.Use 10-25 drops of lavender essential oil with 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) vegetable oil and 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) aloe vera gel as an alternative.Consider using these as body moisturizers and an alternative to soap.
Place a dab on your pet’s collar to repel ticks., Combine lavender essential oil and apple cider vinegar in a container. Apply a small amount to your skin or clothing to keep bugs at bay.Mix 25 drops lavender essential oil with ¼ cup organic apple cider vinegar. You can also use water if the smell of the vinegar is too strong., If you prefer to not put anything on your skin, consider using lavender sachets or pillows. These can help repel bugs around areas in which you may be.Make lavender sachets or pillows by putting dried lavender into little cloth bags or small pillowcases. You can either buy dried lavender or dry some from a plant you may have.
Many health food and home goods stores sell already made lavender sachets and pillowcases.
Place the sachets or pillowcases in cupboards, chests, or even around your bedroom. In addition to repelling insects, it will give the spaces a fresh smell., Spraying lavender on areas that may attract bugs, such as your bedroom or on patio furniture may detract bugs and give the area a pleasant scent. Mixing lavender essential oil with distilled water in a spray bottle can make application of this repellent easy and quick.Add 30-40 drops of your lavender essential oil to 1.5 ounces of distilled water in a clean spray bottle.The amount of essential oil you use will depend on how strong you want the scent.You can also make a spray using dried lavender. Boil 3-4 cups of distilled water and 3–4 tablespoons (44.4–59.1 ml) of dried lavender. Allow the mixture to cool and strain out the plant. Put it in a spray bottle and use as you like.Mist the spray wherever you’d like to repel bugs. Make sure to not douse bed linens or clothing with the spray., Rub lavender flowers that you have at home or purchase on your skin before after you shower. This may keep insects from attacking you.Rub the flowers to hot parts of your body that can help circulate scent such as your neck, underarms, and behind your ears., If you have a garden at your home or even have a balcony at an apartment, plant some lavender. Not only can it beautiful your garden, but it may also keep insects from coming near your home.

, Placing saucers of lavender oil in strategic areas can repel insects from indoor and outdoor spaces.Consider using this method if you want to avoid applying anything to your skin.


Use 30-40 drops of lavender essential oil per 1.5 ounces of distilled water that you want to use in trays.
Fill the trays with the mixture and put in spaces that attract a lot of insects."

Identify the tick by its markings.,
Look at the length of the tick's mouthparts, or ""capitulum."",
Consider where you found the tick.",How to Identify a Deer Tick2," Unfed adult female deer ticks have a unique bright orange-red body surrounding the black scutum. Adult males are dark brown to black in color. The name ""wood tick"" is used for a number of different ticks, including the deer tick, lone star tick, and American dog tick. All three ticks tend to live in wooded or recently cleared areas, and crawl up from the ground. You'll need to look to their markings to tell them apart.Brown dog ticks will have mottled brown and white markings on their scutums, which deer ticks do not have. The lone star tick has a distinctive white star-like marking on its scutum.
The deer tick is about half the size of the brown dog tick, both in its pre-fed state and when engorged.
Brown dog ticks rarely attach to humans.However, they are one of the few ticks that can infest a home. As the name implies, they're frequently carried by dogs, and can be found in kennels, around veterinary offices, and outdoor areas frequented by infected animals., It may look like a head, but this is the part of the tick that attaches to the host in order to feed. It consists of two leg-like sensory structures that detect the presence of a host, a pair of knife-like structures that allow the tick to cut through the skin, and a single barbed structure (the ""hypostome"") that enters this opening.


The capitulum on the deer tick is much longer than in other common ticks, such as the dog tick. The capitulum is positioned to the front, and visible from above.The female deer tick has a larger capitulum than a male deer tick. Adult male deer ticks do not feed.

, Deer ticks are particularly well-established along the Eastern and Upper Midwestern United States, but can be found as far south as Texas and into Missouri, Kansas, and parts of Oklahoma.Deer ticks are most active in the spring, summer and fall. However, they may be active whenever the temperature is above freezing. Other forms of ticks, such as the dog tick, are generally most active in spring and summer months only.The adult form of the deer tick lives in woody, brushy habitats. They prefer low-lying shrubs, not trees.The Western Blacklegged Tick is another form of the deer tick, found along the Pacific Coastal regions. It is especially active in Northern California. This form of tick rarely attaches to humans."

Consider commercially-produced natural repellents.,
Wear a repellent band or clip on device.,
Burn a citronella candle.,
Wear long sleeves and pants.,
Control the environment around you.,
Forget zappers and ultrasonic devices.",How to Make a Lavender Insect Repellent2," Many companies are increasingly offering insect repellents that don’t contain chemicals. Considering trying one of these natural products, which are as effective as natural products you can make using lavender.Companies such as California Baby, Buzz Away, and Bite Blocker offer natural, non-chemical, non-toxic and hypoallergenic insect repellents.Ask your doctor or pharmacist for recommendations for natural bug repellents that you can buy.

, Recent studies have shown that using a plastic bracelet or clip-on device that diffuse natural insect repellents are effective at keeping bugs from attacking you.Wristbands allow you to wear a repellent at all times and provide protection within a radius of a foot or two. Clip-on devices will either attach to a belt, or even a chair if you prefer to not have it on you.Buy wristband and devices and pharmacies, large retailers, and health food stores.

, Studies have shown that citronella candles may reduce insect bites.Burn citronella candles in areas that you will be to keep bugs at bay.


Buy a candle with a concentration of citronella that is 5-10%.Make sure to burn the candle for as long as you are outside or in an area where there are a lot of bugs because the oils can evaporate quickly and lose efficacy, leaving you unprotected., If you’re going to be in an area infested with bugs or outside for longer periods of time, wear loose, long-sleeved shirts and pants. This may keep insects from attacking you.Wear moderately thick fabric so that bugs cannot bite through material., Certain environmental factors can deter insects or keep them at bay. From using fans to filling puddles, you can make the environment around you unappetizing for insects.Place window, overhead, or standing fans around your home. Many insects have a difficult time navigating in the wind.Get rid of any standing water in your yard that can attract insects and promote breeding. This includes emptying birth baths and filling puddles., Studies have shown that most bug zappers and ultrasonic devices don’t work. In fact, they may kill bugs beneficial to birds and your garden.Scientists have not done enough research on insect traps, which mimic a breathing animal or person. In addition, these devices can be loud as they run on a gas powered engine."

Learn all you can about the dangers of being exposed to cold weather, the signs of the medical conditions that can result from cold exposure, and how to treat any resulting injuries.,
Wear as many layers of clothing as possible, which allow you to move comfortably.,
Take frequent drinks of warm liquids such as decaffeinated coffee, tea, broth, or hot chocolate.,
Protect your extremities as well as your ears and nose with a hat, scarf, gloves, and thick socks.,
Be aware of the weather conditions as you prepare to work in the cold.",How to Work in Cold Weather,"


Frostbite, which is when the skin and underlying tissues are damaged (usually in the extremities) from cold exposure, has symptoms that include ""pins and needles"" sensations followed by numbness.
Hypothermia is when the body's core temperature drops significantly below normal.;
, One thick layer of clothing is not as effective in insulating your body against the cold as several layers are.


The first layer should be a synthetic blend that can wick sweat away from your body.
The second layer of clothing should be wool.
The third layer should be a weather-proof outer layer followed by a down coat or vest.
Lean people may need more insulation than someone who is heavier.

,


Avoid caffeine or alcohol when working in the cold.

,


Feet and hands can become vulnerable to injury, such as frostbite and chilblains as the heat of the body moves toward the core in cold weather.
More than 40% of your body heat may be lost if your head is uncovered. Wearing a warm cap that covers your ears is very important when working in the cold.
Wear boots that are waterproof and insulated.

, Wet conditions and low windchill can decrease body temperature very quickly, causing significant risk if you work outside. The warm air surrounding your body is taken away more quickly as the wind increases.


Erect a shelter to work out of the wind if possible.
If you are on a route where you are exposed to cold outside conditions, stop as frequently as possible in a warm area, such as a gas station, to warm up.

Stay calm and try not to tense up.,
Focus on your breathing.,
Remember that camels are calm by nature.,
Talk to the camel softly, and don't ever raise your voice at it.,
Don't kick or hurt the camel as an attempt to slow it down.,
Maintain a firm grip on the reins, but don't pull too hard.,
Try to get the camel moving in a circle.,
Try to remain saddled until the camel stops.,
Consider a quick dismount if all else fails.,
Get off the camel once you have it under control.,
Keep a safe distance from your camel.,
Do not run away from the camel.,
Do not make any sharp or sudden movements.,
Try walking in a slow circle around your camel while talking to it calmly.",How to Regain Control of a Spooked Camel," Camels are very intuitive creatures. They will be able to tell if you're feeling nervous and angry. If they sense your anxiety or anger, they'll get even more spooked. Because of this, it's important to try to manage your emotions as much as you can, even if you're scared out of your mind.;
, Some people find that breathing in quickly, and then exhaling slowly, helps them feel calmer. Other people find that breathing in and out on counts of three helps. The important thing is to keep your breathing consistent.

, Your camel will eventually regain its composure and slow down pretty quickly, so long as you keep your wits about you.

, Yelling at the camel to stop will make it even more spooked. Instead, talk to the camel in a gentle, soothing voice as you attempt to get it to slow down., This will only make the camel feel even more scared and confused (and may cause it to speed up or become more erratic). If you want the camel to trust you, then he has to look at you as a friend, not an enemy.

, Pulling too hard may cause the camel to panic. It may also break the reins or pull the peg out of the camel's nose. This will cause it to panic even more.At the same time, however, you want to keep a firm grip on the reins. If they are too slack, the camel may sense a lack of control and take advantage of it.Camels are cud-chewing animals, so their reins are usually attached to a peg inserted into their noses, as opposed to being attached to a bit in the mouth. This means that, unlike with a horse, you can’t try to steer an out-of-control camel by pulling hard on the reins.
Make sure you have sturdy reins and a head halter, especially if you don’t have much riding experience. A head halter can make it much easier to regain control of your camel, and you won’t have to worry about hurting it by ripping the peg out of its nose.

, If the reins are attached to a head halter, you can pull on the reins gently to get the camel to turn in a circle and eventually slow down. Even if the camel has a nose halter, try to pull the reins in the direction that the camel wants to go (right or left) while getting it to move in a circle; work with the camel, not against it. If the camel decides to turn its head the other way, allow it to do so, and pull the rein on that side instead. The goal is to remain close to the group and not to get too off course or lost.


Only apply a slight pull to the reins when trying to get the camel to turn. It usually doesn’t take much, and an overzealous pull can hurt your camel if the reins are attached to a nose peg. Remember, a hurt camel is a frightened camel.

, If you can't get it to circle, you must hang on and let it run. Press yourself to the camel to lower your center of gravity. Grip the camel between your legs and hold the horn of the saddle (if it is available). If you aren’t using a saddle, hold on as well as you can, and lean back a little. This way, you won't be riding near the tip of the hump, which will be a very bumpy ride at high speeds.

, This should be your last resort. You should only do it if you've lost the reins or are moving quickly toward an even more dangerous situation, like a cliff. To dismount the camel, kick out of the stirrups and try to slide off the back side of the camel. If you can't, try to slide sideways out of the saddle. Try to hit the ground running, bending your knees slightly as you land.


Once you’re on the ground, try to grab the reins. The camel will most likely come to a stop once you have the reins in your hands again.
Most camels like to stay close to the herd. If you dismount and cannot grab the reins, the camel will likely come back once it calms down.

, Once the wild ride is over, have the camel sit. Dismount and keep a firm hold on the reins.

, Unlike horses, camels can kick in all directions. Their kicks are very powerful, and very strong. A frightened camel is a spooked camel. If you get too close to it too quickly, it may try to defend itself by kicking you., If you turn your back to the camel, it may chase after you.

, Even if your camel is no longer running, it may still be feeling anxious. Any sharp, sudden movements may only spook it further., This may help calm and reassure the camel. Talk soothingly to it, and try not to make any sharp, sudden movements. Be sure to keep a firm grip on the reins."

Shellac is a resin with many uses,including wood polishes like ""French polish"", primers, dyes, and confectioner's resin -- which is used to polish some foods like certain fruits, chewing gum, and candies.Between 50,000 and 300,000 lac bugs are required to produce 1 kilogram of shellac.The Vegetarian Resource Group has a list of candies that do and don't contain shellac. As an example, candy corn and Milk Duds contains shellac, while M&M's and Skittles do not.
Shellac has food-additive number E904 in the European Union.,


A study in the UK reported in 2004 that a postcard-sized area of the front of a car squashes into one insect for every 5 miles (8.0 km) driven.A similar study in the Netherlands in 2011 found one insect squashed on a license-plate-sized area of the car for every 3.1 miles (5.0 km) driven.During rainstorms, worms, slugs, and other small critters may crawl onto roads, where cars then run over them. If these animals are on your roads, try to reduce how much you drive when the road is wet.

,


Soil, especially grassy areas, is teeming with little insects that may be crushed by your footsteps.
If it's raining and worms or slugs are out on the sidewalk, watch your step to avoid them if possible.
Shoes with lower surface area (e.g. because of heels) may crush fewer insects per step.

Also, standing water may breed mosquitoes.If you have a pool, cover it when not in use to reduce the number of bugs that get trapped in the water.

,


Scoop up bugs on the floors into paper or a ziploc bag and take them outside.
Use a ziploc bag to catch flies, moths, and other flying insects. Zip up the bag, take it outside, and release the insect. Alternatively, you can trap the insect in a jar and slide paper under it to capture it. Or use a bug net if you have one.

, Sometimes you accidentally injure a bug, or you see a bug that's sickly and in pain. In these cases it may be best to mercy-kill it -- but only if you can crush it instantaneously.


Try putting the insect on a piece of scrap paper and then slamming a wooden board or other hard, flat surface across it, squashing it out onto the paper. The paper's friction helps ensure the insect will be completely crushed. Sometimes insects have hard shells, making it more difficult to kill them painlessly in this way.
Don't just crush the head, because insects have more distributed nervous systems than vertebrates.Generally avoid killing with flyswatters or your hands because these may not crush the insects completely.

, Most of the harm that the world's insects endure results from natural causes. Explore what ecology and ethology have to say about the potential for reducing suffering by insects in nature.,"

Know how long the winter time in Buffalo typically lasts.,
Buy an extremely warm coat, as well as a jacket that will be good for springtime temperatures and weather.,
Make sure that you have proper footwear for the weather.,
Focus on staying warm, and not looking cute or cool.,
Ensure that your heating system in both your apartment and car are working properly ahead of time.,
Go outside and travel only when necessary during extreme weather conditions.,
Be prepared for last minute closings, cancellations and early releases.","How to Survive a Winter in Buffalo, NY"," Typically, the last of the snow is melted by early March, or sometimes as late as April. Therefore, when winter starts and ends is usually very different every year.


The overall weather pattern can also be unpredictable. Snow, rain, wind and bright sunshine have all been seen at different points during the winter in Buffalo.;
, This is because temperatures, even during the winter time in Buffalo, can also be very unpredictable. One day, it may be 20 degrees farenheit outside, and the next day, it may rise up to 50 or higher! It is important to find coats that you are comfortable wearing a lot, and that the weather won’t ruin.

A good idea may be to purchase a coat with other coats inside of it. This may cost a bit more, but it contains usually a sweatshirt, a spring jacket, and a heavy winter jacket. This way, if it is warmer one day, you can simply take out the jacket that you want to wear.







, In Buffalo, UGG boots aren’t always your best go to option, and sometimes rain boots aren’t either. UGG boots aren't meant for several feet of snow because of how they are made, the snow will stick to the boot and melt causing your feet to be wet and cold inside the boot. Rain boots aren’t meant to walk through several feet of snow either, because rain boots don’t have enough grip on the bottom which may cause you to slip when the snow starts turning to ice. Snow boots are an investment, but they are worth it for those days that there may be extreme snowfall. Some people may think about Timberland boots as an alternative to snow boots, but there isn’t enough grip on the bottom of those boots for severe snow conditions. So, snow boots are the solution to walk in several feet of snow or on ice once the snow starts to melt.

, Sure, everyone else may be wearing light sweatshirts that you think you would look amazing in, but if the temperature feels cold to you, put a jacket on, and don't worry about what anybody else thinks. In Buffalo, you will most likely be wearing your jacket more often than not throughout the entire duration of winter.

, You don’t want to wait until the temperatures start dropping to find out that your heater doesn’t work and that you need to replace it. Since everyone tends to wait to check, then all the demands for heaters to be checked and replaced if necessary start to pile up, and you could be without heat for a while waiting for someone to come out and fix it. So to ensure that everything is working fine for the winter, you should just check ahead of time. Check in the middle of September, because even though this may seem a bit early to you, snowstorms have occurred in Buffalo as early as October, so you need to be prepared.

, If you must go out, then use extra caution. That is why it is important to be prepared for the weather ahead of time, so that you aren’t one of those people that wait until it actually is a snowstorm to have to go food shopping. When it is extreme snowfall, it is really dangerous to be driving because most of the time the roads aren’t clear. Jessica Firger from CBS news stated, “It goes without saying that if the snow is coming down hard and you hear blizzard warnings on the news, then it's probably best to stay indoors, ideally in a home that's well stocked with emergency provisions such as food, water, flashlights and a battery-powered crank radio.” It is important to keep up with news updates and updates from local schools. Try to go food shopping at least three days before the heavy snowfall is expected, and check your email or local news stations to see if schools and local businesses are closed so that you can stay indoors during the bad weather.

, This is especially important if you have children. Sometimes, schools may call you to say they are closed just as you are waking up in the morning. Or, you may get a call midday to say they are letting kids out early. While schools often try to avoid both situations, sometimes, it may be necessary.

Don't take your eyes off the shark.,
Stay calm and don't make sudden movements.,
Get into a defensive position.,
Hit the shark in the face and gills.,
Keep fighting if the shark persists.,
Get out of the water.,
Get medical attention.",How to Survive a Shark Attack," Sharks have several different attack methods. Sometimes they swim right up and have at it, sometimes they circle for awhile before lunging, and sometimes they sneak up from behind for a surprise attack. To be able to defend against the shark, you must know where it is, so make every effort to watch the animal, even as you're working out your escape., When you first spot the shark, chances are it will swim away without bothering you. You cannot out-swim a shark, so trying to sprint to safety may not be your best option, unless you're already very close to shore. It's important to keep your wits about you so you can continuously appraise the situation and figure out how to get to safety.


Move slowly toward the shore or a boat; choose whichever is closest. Don't thrash your arms or kick or splash while you swim.
Do not block the shark's path. If you're standing between the shark and the open ocean, move away.Don't turn your back on the shark as you move. Remember, it's important to keep the shark in view.

, If you can't get out of the water right away, try to reduce the shark's possible angles of attack. If you're in shallow enough water, keep your feet on the ground. Slowly back up against a reef, piling, or rock outcropping - any solid obstruction – so that the shark can't circle around behind you. This way you only have to defend attacks in front of you.


If you're diving near the shore, you may need to descend to find cover. Look for a reef or rock on the bottom of the ocean.
In open water, get back-to-back with another swimmer or diver so that you can see, and defend against, an attack from any direction.

, Playing dead won't deter an aggressive shark. Your best bet if attacked is to make the shark see you as a strong, credible threat. Usually, a hard blow to the shark's gills, eyes or snout will cause it to retreat.These are really the only vulnerable areas on a shark.


If you have a spear gun or pole, use it! A sharp object is a good way to inflict enough pain to scare away the shark. Aim for the head, specifically the eyes or the gills.






If you don't have a weapon, improvise. Use any inanimate object, such as a camera or a rock to ward off the shark.






If you have nothing around you, use your own body. Aim for the shark's eyes, gills, or snout (end of its nose). Fight with your fists, elbows, knees, and feet.







, Hit the eyes and gills repeatedly with hard, sharp jabs. Don't wind up before hitting, since this doesn't provide extra force underwater. You can also claw at the eyes and the gills. Keep doing this until the shark lets you go and swims away., Even if the shark swims away, you're not truly safe until you're out of the water. Sharks may leave temporarily and then come back to continue the attack. Get back to shore or back on the boat as quickly as possible.


If a boat is nearby, call out calmly, but loudly, for them to come to you. Stay as still as possible while waiting - as long as the shark is not actively attacking you - and get into the boat as quickly as possible once the boat reaches you.






If you are near shore, swim quickly, but smoothly. Thrashing will attract the shark's attention again and disperse your blood, which could draw more sharks. Do the smooth reverse breast stroke, which requires less splashing than other strokes.







, If you've been bitten, get treatment as soon as possible. Massive blood loss could occur, depending on where you've been bitten, so immediately take appropriate steps to stop the bleeding. Even if your wounds appear minor, it's essential to get yourself checked out. Remain calm until you get medical care so your blood does not pump faster through your body.

Adjust your wardrobe.,
Eat right.,
Add another blanket to the bed.",How to Survive a Cold Winter1," Make sure you stay warm at home and that your car is ready to weather extreme temperatures.

, For sleeping attire; get out your “long johns” and flannel pajamas. Keep a robe handy to your bed for use when you get up. Put your flip-flops in the closet and get out some slippers with a sole and a warm lining. Wear heavier socks. Winter months mean storing your T-shirts and shorts away and switching to sweats, lightweight but warm sweaters with long sleeves. (Keep a couple of those T-shirts on hand to wear as an undergarment.) Invest in thermal undergarments.

, A hot breakfast versus cereal with cold milk can make a big difference. Oatmeal, eggs and toast, pancakes or waffles or even a bowl of soup will take you farther. (Sprinkle some freshly made popcorn over a bowl of tomato soup for breakfast or lunch. It’s a treat that will help keep you warm.) Keep your carbs up. Hot pasta dishes, a stove-top stew of potatoes and chunky vegetables are great tummy warmers. (Afraid of added weight? Your body will burn those carb calories keeping you warm. Or get out there and move some snow; it’s great exercise.)

, Down-filled bedding is pricey, but well worth the investment. Consider flannel sheets and/or a quilt.

Understand what wind chill is.,
Understand what the wind chill factor is.,
Calculate the wind chill factor.,
Use the wind chill factor to take evasive action.,
Stay warm.",How to Understand and Use the Wind Chill Factor," Wind chill is the effect that wind has on our skin in cold weather. It is not something that makes the actual outside temperature less but it is the combination of the cold air and wind impacting on our skin. It does not have any temperature-reduction effect on non-living objects (although the wind itself can obviously affect things like camping stoves for mountaineers etc.). Our skin feels colder because its internal body heat that usually generates a ""boundary layer"" of heat surrounding our body is ""blown away"" by the wind hitting it. Removal of this tiny layer of warm air from around our body leaves us exposed directly to the cold air. It is even more evident if your skin is wet because this draws away the heat very quickly and leaves you with the feeling of ""bone-chilling"".;
, The wind chill factor is a way of calculating the impact of a wind on a human body. Recent wind chill factor measurements are provided in a temperature format for the public because this is the easiest way for us to understand it.

, This is a formula that is easiest to calculate using an online calculator. Search for a wind chill calculator to use. Or, if you're mathematically minded, you could try it the hard way, which involves using a formula; see, for instance: USA Today wind chill formulas.

, When you hear the wind chill factor, it is safest to assume that the wind chill temperature is the temperature for which you should prepare. Wear clothes appropriate to that temperature, sun screen, hats, gloves/mittens, boots, etc. Stay indoors if the weather is going to be too cold with the wind chill factored in.

, Apart from having good clothing as a barrier between you and the cold, you can help reduce heat loss through exercising constantly (walking, skiing, snowshoeing etc.). You'll notice how quickly you cool down when you stop moving after activity. Try eating high protein/energy foods such as nuts, energy bars etc and drink hot drinks - even hot water with a dash of cayenne pepper is known to provide an instant heat spike that will help your body glow in the cold.

Wear warm clothing.,
Cover every part of yourself.,
Create friction.,
Move your arms and legs around.,
Huddle up.",How to Warm Yourself Up1," The best way to keep warm is to wear appropriate clothing. If you are going to be outside, wear layers. Layering is the best way to keep warm.


You should have three layers of insulation. For the first layer, wear thermals, long johns, or material that wicks away moisture. For the mid layer, wear thick materials, such as fleece and down. For the outer layer, wear a material that protects you from snow, rain, and wind.Your layers should be loose instead of confining. You want to avoid sweating, because sweating creates moisture, which makes you colder.;
, Wear a hat, a scarf, and gloves. Forgetting a scarf can make you much colder because you lose a lot of heat through your neck. Only wearing one layer of pants is a major mistake people make. Wear thermal pants, fleece tights, and leg warmers under your jeans. Wear multiple pair of socks with winter weather boots. Make sure one pair of socks is a closely fitting wool.

, If you don't have warm clothes, or if you're wearing layers but are still cold, create friction on the cold parts of your body. That generates some heat. Rub your arms or legs and try to create as much friction as you can.


If it is possible, put your arms inside of your shirt and keep them there. You have become a larger mass and are therefore retaining more heat as the heat radiates off of the clothing and both of your arms. If you are wearing long sleeves put one arm in one sleeve and vice versa.
Become the largest mass you can. Put your arms and hands under your legs or use the shirt technique. But do not separate yourself; the most heat is conducted when many things are together and can mutually share and give off heat.

, To get your feet and hands warm, get some blood pumping into them. If your feet are cold, try moving your leg back and forth 30-50 times. Make sure when you move that you include the thigh muscle and that you swing the leg in wide arcs. To warm up your arms, move your arms in large 360 degree circular movements. Make sure to engage your entire arm in the movement.One reason why your hands and feet get cold is because your core is pulling all the heat towards it, leaving your hands and feet bloodless and heatless. Wear vests and more layers over your torso if your hands and feet are constantly cold.
If your extremities like your nose or hands are cold, then blow on them. Use hot, warm air generated from the back of your throat for your hands. For your nose, you may want to clasp your hand over your nose. Not only will you warm your nose, but you will also warm your hands with the warm air from your nose.

, Body heat is transferred between people. The bigger mass attracts more heat. Other people give off lots of body heat. If you are stranded with someone else, cuddle close together to stay warm.

Soup has the added benefit of being low in calories.


Drinking hot beverages also can warm your hands. Wrapping your cold hands around a mug of hot tea can warm you up in minutes.

, Ginger is a natural way to get warm, with tons of beneficial side effects. Ginger works as a stimulant, which gets the blood circulating and makes your body temperature rise. It warms you from the inside. Try drinking ginger in tea, eating gingerbread or gingersnap cookies, or sprinkling it into other dishes.Try putting ginger powder in shoes, slippers, or socks if you cannot get your feet warm.

, Using the oven and crock pot helps warm up the kitchen by cooking at lower temperatures for a longer period of time. Casseroles, stews, and soups all warm the body when they are eaten., Soaking in a hot tub raises your body temperature.If you are cold, try soaking in hot water, or take a hot shower if you prefer. After you take the shower, dry off as quickly as possible and put on long sleeves and pants to trap the heat on your body, helping to keep you warm.


Try saunas and steam rooms to warm up, if you have access to them.

, One reason for poor body temperature regulation is a low body fat ratio. Fat is needed to insulate your body. Eat a diet with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, found in foods such as nuts, salmon, avocados, and olive oil., Doing chores around the house gets you moving, which gets your blood pumping. When your blood starts circulating, your core temperature rises. Vacuum, dust, and sweep to warm yourself.Washing dishes can help warm you significantly. Fill the sink with warm water. Leaving your hands in the warmth while you wash and rinse the dishes will help raise your body temperature.
Doing laundry can also help you fight the cold. The warmth from the dryer can help warm your cold hands and arms. Taking clothes right out of the dryer and putting them on can warm you.

, Exercise gets your blood pumping, which helps warm you up. Run, lift weights, do yoga, or any kind of movement that gets you to work up a sweat.


If you are unable to do large scale exercise, do a much smaller form of physical exertion like jostling your legs or moving your arms.
Practice Ashtanga yoga to warm yourself up. This form of yoga takes you through poses and breathing exercises that generate internal body heat.Cold right now with no time for yoga classes? Try this simple yoga warming pose: the cobra. Lie face down on the floor. Place your palms near your chest. Push up, lifting your head, shoulders, and chest. Pull your shoulder blades down and together. Hold for a few seconds, then lower. Do a few reps to feel warmer., When you breathe through your nose, the air is warmed, which helps raise your body temperature. Try breathing in and holding for four seconds before exhaling. Repeat a few times to warm yourself., According to a study done at the University of Toronto, people who are lonely or excluded feel colder. Spending time with people makes you feel warmer. Instead of staying alone in front of the television, get together with a friend or family member."

Take a hot shower or bath.",How to Stay Warm in Cold Weather," This is an easy way to stay warmer without having to do much. An under-layer is a layer of clothing which goes under your normal clothing. This under-layer can take many forms, but each can help you stay warm without adding a lot of bulk or extra steps.


Common under-layer items include stockings, leggings, thermal shirts, and long underwear.
It’s important to keep in mind that having this under-layer can become uncomfortable if you are in a warm room if you have outer layers on.
For example, if you bundle up to drive to work in a warm office, you may find the additional base layer too much.
After skiing, you may have to strip down to your thermals when sitting in front of the fireplace in your alpine cabin. If opaque, this is generally considered appropriate apres-ski wear.;
, When you know there will be chances to get wet, it’s important to have a waterproof layer to stay warm. If the water penetrates through your clothing, your clothing will only make you colder. Examples of watery conditions you might encounter include rain, snow, and spray (such as if you will be out on a boat or if there are lots of puddles on the ground).


You can throw a rain jacket on under a warm but less waterproof coat, for example. When you buy coats, look for materials that are very waterproof and warm, such as neoprene.

, Aside from just keeping dry, you want to look for clothing made out of materials that are very insulating. You’ve probably heard about fleece but this fabric is not for everyone. Find out what other options are available to you and then go on a shopping trip.


Wear wool, if you can. This is one of the best insulating materials, even though it can be expensive. You can also use wool clothes, instead of just wool coats, to cut down on how much you need to wear total. Many inexpensive wool items can be found at vintage stores.
Other warm materials include down, lined leather, fur, and neoprene.
Wool will continue to keep you warm, even if wet. This is not true of most materials such as leather or quilted cotton.

, It’s not completely true that you lose X percentage of heat from your head or your feet or whatever.However, it is true that leaving these areas uncovered can make it tough for you to stay warm.When you’re outside, try to keep your head, hands, and feet covered with a scarf, hat, gloves, and thick fuzzy socks and boots. You may also wear two layers of socks or leggings/thermals under your jeans. It may not make you look like the pinnacle of fashion, but you will be warm.


It is very important for all of these items to be waterproof, since these are the areas where you are most likely to notice wetness and added cold. For example, use lined leather gloves if you can.

, When you're forced to go outside, stay as far away as you can from things like rain, snow, puddles, ice, and wind. These things getting too close is what makes you feel cold; your clothing and body can usually handle the air temperature okay. Move quickly between buildings, use a car when you can, and when you must be outside, try to walk under a shelter.

, You can carry around little heat sources with you, if you find yourself struggling to stay warm. Small items, like reusable hand warmers, can be put in a pocket to get the job done when gloves just aren’t enough. Other items, like travel mugs full of soup, can be used to warm you from the inside out.


You can even make your own hand warmers if you can’t find anywhere to buy them for a good price. There are many websites with instructions and all are easy to make with the right ingredients.

, We know you want to look hot, but there’s a reason why Eskimos wear those big coats and loose pants. When your clothing fits tightly, it can’t keep you warm or comfortable. Instead, if you want to stay warm, make sure the clothes that you’re wearing fit loosely. This creates a protective layer of warm air between your skin and the environment on the other side of that fabric.

, If your clothes themselves can’t keep you warm, let your body create heat. Moving around will burn energy in your body, which gets expressed as heat. Try exercising or at least try not to stand still.


Jumping jacks are a good option if you're inside. However, when you're outside movement like that can be dangerous because of slippery ground conditions. A better way to get active when you're outside is to do small lunges, which create less chances for slipping.

, The most basic thing you can do to stay warm both inside and outside is to layer your clothing. Ask anyone who has lived in some of the colder parts of the world, like Alaska and Norway, and they’ll all tell you: wear layers. This lets you have one outfit for the day that adjusts easily for snowy weather outside, as well as switching over naturally to your toasty warm office.


An example outfit would include stockings, jeans, a long sleeve shirt, a button up shirt, a sweater, and a coat. With all of these things on, or a combination of these things on, you can easily adjust to a roaring hot classroom, an icy office, a neutral grocery store, and the freezing temperatures outside without any problem at all.

, Make sure your home is as insulated as it can be. You might want to switch out the insulation in your walls or ceiling. You can also do more basic things, like putting up thick curtains and blankets over windows.


Cellular shades are actually pretty effective at keeping cold air from escaping a window and they're often cheaper than other curtain options.
You can also further insulate windows and any glass on doors with insulating film, a plastic material that is clear and adhered to all of the glass.

, It is often easier and cheaper to focus on keeping one room warm than on keeping an entire apartment or house warm. Figure out a single room that your family can stick to during waking hours and seal it off from the rest of the house. Close doors and keep them covered in blankets. Centralize your heaters and other methods of warming the room. This saves you from having to put a lot of effort into keep rooms warm that you won't use very often.

, You'll want to keep an eye out for holes and gaps that let cold air into your home or between rooms that have different levels of insulation. The most common example is the gap under doors, but you may also find some windows let in a draft or that rooms above a basement have cold air coming up through the floor.


Rolled up blankets and carpets can easily be used to plug these gaps.

, You'll probably want your bed to be at least a little warm before you crawl in to go to sleep. Those icy sheets are no-one's friend. There are lots of ways that you can get your bed ready before it's time to sleep. Try:


A hot water bottle, placed under the blanket at the lower center of the bed, or run your blanket through the dryer for 10-20 minutes on med or high heat.

, Or anything, really. Your oven, when it's turned on and heated up to the usual baking temperature of around 365 degrees, can work really well to make the room that it's in nice and warm. Make the kitchen your weekend base of operations and hang out while cookies or a dinner roast is prepared.


Doing your laundry can similarly heat up nearby rooms. Make your chores count and be quick to do your laundry on really cold days. You can wear items fresh out of the dryer to get even warmer.

, Whether it's a hot cup of lemon tea or a Mexican coffee, drinking a hot liquid can boost how warm you feel from the inside out. Turn the kettle on and then break out the mugs because you're about to get nice and warm.


You might think or have been told that adding alcohol to a hot drink will make you feel warmer, but that's not really the best advice. Alcohol actually lowers your body temperature, even though it gives you that ""burning"" feeling. If it's dangerously cold in your home, you should avoid alcohol.

, A hot shower or bath can be just enough to get your body back to a reasonable level of warmth. Find yourself just getting cold again after five minutes? Make sure you're bundling up as soon as you get out, with warm house clothes, a robe, and house shoes. This will help your body retain the heat of the bath.

Get your child to the hospital as quickly as possible.",How to Treat Frostbite in Children1," The first thing to do, is to call for medical help, call your doctor, the nearest medical care center or hospital as your child will need medical review as soon as possible, receiving the right care from a well trained medical team will decrease the chances of getting a deep tissue damage to a great extent.;
, The first thing is to get your child inside if he was being outdoors, away from the freezing weather and make sure he is staying in a warmer weather than outside, if you doubt that his feet are the affected site, carry him, don’t let him walk on a frozen feet or toes, that would increase the tissues damage.


I you are outdoors and can’t find any warm places around, try to seek any shelter that keep you both away from snow, chilly winds, or excessive freezing weather, any shelter would be better than staying outdoors in the frozen temperatures, shelters could be like staying inside a car or a truck, old house, in a tent or even in a cave!
Make sure to close all windows, doors or any opening hole that can get you excessive cold from outside, you can use any piece of cloths, wooden blankets or anything in hands to cover or close the opening hole, this is important to keep the shelter you’ve entered warmer than outside, and to keep it warm till any kind of help get to you, you can ask anyone with you to ensure and check the openings in the shelter, while you can take care of your child, or if necessary; to do it yourself in quick moves.

, Take off all the wet clothes that would be on the affected body part, or on the body itself because it can still decrease the body’s temperature to be replaced with dry ones.


Make sure to remove the jewelry too as a bracelet or a finger ring, jewelry may become very tight specially with skin swelling, that may worsen the condition by preventing blood from reaching the far points at the extremities.

, Try to elevate his internal body temperature by adding warming blankets on his body and wrapping the affected skin area with blanket or bandage too if possible, you can use any kind of thick covers, like blankets, jackets, or coats, offering him a warm drink and trying to keep him calm and comfort is very useful too.


Avoid using any of the following to elevate his body temperature or to increase his warmth, a hair dryer, direct fire, heating pad, hot water, or rubbing his cold skin with ice or by massaging, all these methods apply a strong sudden heat that can increase his skin damage and can badly worsen his condition.
As a matter of fact; it is advisable to insert cotton pieces or small clothes between his fingers or toes to avoid any rubbing movement that can affect him in a negative way and increase his skin damage degree.
Do not manipulate any blisters that might be formed at any time on the affected skin, and prevent your child from playing with them, popping them can lead to skin infection which is another problem your child don’t need it at this time.

, Exposing your child’s affected limb to a freezing conditions, then re warming, then freezing again would put him in high risks of having great permanent tissue damage, once re warmth procedures are applied; you can’t allow his exposure to another freezing conditions.

, Re-warmth can be done first by placing the affected fingers for example at the underarms to gain some of the body’s own temperature, other places would be like between the groins too, frostbitten feet can be placed in another person’s stomach, in some cases; skin to skin contact by hugging him under several layers of warm blankets would be helpful too.


Then the affected limbs can be immersed in warm water (Never use hot water as it can easily burn the skin and cause further skin damage) in the range of 100 – 105 F that equals 38 – 41 C to be replaced when it get cool, don’t use your child’s affected limb to check for the water temperature, he can’t tell any difference and it can burn and damage his skin if it was hot, instead; use your elbow to check for water’s temperature, if your elbow can handle it, it is suitable for your child’s affected limb.
Re-warmth of the affected limb would regain a degree of sensation to it gradually by starting to feel some pain and the skin getting some pinky color, at this point; dry your child’s limb gently by tapping it, then wrap it carefully with a clean bandage then with a warm blanket to keep it warm.
Keep the affected frostbitten limb above the heart level to minimize swelling as much as possible, by using a cushion on the armed chair for hand fingers or elevating the whole leg on a chair or bed for feet toes.

, If your child’s cheeks, ears, nose or chin were the affected areas; immerse a clean cotton towel in the warm water, squeeze then wrap it around his face.


Repeat till he gains some sensation there and the affected areas start to have pink color, then dry them gently, and keep them warm by wrapping another dry towel and blanket around his face and neck.

, If you didn’t get the medical help you are waiting for, you may have to transport your child by yourself, get the assistance of another family member or a friend to carry your child to the car while keeping him warm and wrapped with blankets, keeping him calm till reaching the nearest hospital.


Remember; the faster he receives the right medical care, the shorter the frozen time his affected tissues would be exposed to, and so the lesser the damage degree he would experience.

Inform your child’s doctor about what happened.,
Allow the doctor to look for response signs.,
Know that more severe cases of frostbite will require further medical attention.,
Understand that your child will need painkillers.,
Be aware that your child may need to be treated for dehydration.",How to Treat Frostbite in Children2," After following the first aid steps mentioned above and getting your child to the doctor, doctor will gather quick information on your child’s condition, time of exposure to the frozen conditions and what steps you had applied with him.


hen vital signs evaluation that is critical to detect any life threatening condition and control it at the moment, checking his body’s temperature, blood pressure, pulse, heart and respiratory rate are all very important in evaluating your child’s medical state.
These data would provide the doctor with a conclusion about the frostbite degree whether being superficial or deep.

, Good responding signs like pink skin color after re warming, regaining back sensation gradually, a degree of skin elasticity with a finger pressing test, even blisters formation containing clear fluid are all indicating a superficial frostbite that reflects good skin response for healing.


This may require child hospitalization for a few hours for observation, then frequent follow up with his doctor after few weeks to check for his affected skin condition, and detecting any possible damage that may appear in a while.
Parents can return to their doctor if they noticed another swelling of the affected skin, increasing the redness color of it, new blisters formation, pus or thick fluid oozing or if their child had a fever, these signs may be indicating bacterial skin formation, or reflecting the signs of a deeper frostbite damage that is revealed after a while,

, On the other hand; hard skin that leaves no marks after finger pressing test, or blisters with dark fluid may indicate deeper frostbite damage that may require additional medical care. For such severe cases; traditional re warmth home methods may not be sufficient for deeper tissue damage that may require another method made at the hospital.


This is done by applying a circulated water bath containing warm water with a degree of 104 – 107 F that equals 40 – 42 C that can be supplied continuously till achieving complete re warming, this procedure can take about fifteen to thirty minutes according to each child condition.
For deeper frostbite; re warmth procedure would be much painful than with superficial frostbite that may need the prescription of a painkiller as Brufen (Ibuprofen) which is a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug (NSAID) that has an analgesic and anti inflammatory properties too.

, NSAIDs’ anti inflammatory properties come from their ability to block the two enzymes COX – I and COX – II that are responsible for inflammation process initiation, this would help in decreasing much of the pain happening with the re warmth procedure that can be very severe with deeper frostbite cases.


Brufen is available in many dosage forms as 200, 400 mg tablets, syrup, effervescent sachets, or as injections available as Voltaren injections from the same NSAIDs category, young children could be prescribed with the syrup dosage form as one tablespoonful to be taken three times daily, children older in age can take the pills according to their doctor’s orders, that he can calculate the accurate dose for them depending on their age, to be taken twice or three times daily.
The injection forms are only prescribed in severe cases and to older children above the age of twelve, and again; doctor will determine the efficient dose for every child according to his age and his medical condition, all NSAIDs taken orally should be taken after meals to prevent any unwanted gastric symptoms.

, Some frostbite conditions may also require intravenous IV infusion of fluids to treat dehydration.


Rehydran solution are available for children containing all the electrolytes needed to re supply their bodies with all the lost minerals and fluids, to be administrated whenever needed under the supervision of the doctor and the whole medical team.
Rehydran sachets are also available for mild cases to be taken three times daily for dehydration treatment, containing Chloride, Citrates, Glucose, Potassium, Sodium and Zinc, these all minerals would be sufficient to improve his health condition.

Keep your children indoors on the coldest days.,
In cold weather; ensure that your children are wearing proper clothing.,
Be vigilant about frostbite.",How to Treat Frostbite in Children3," Ensure that they are getting the right warmth degree they need, keep your eyes on your local forecasts, record the expecting cold days coming up especially in holidays, weekends, or any occasions your kids may have activities, if you are planning to travel to another country, have full details of its climate, and always be prepared with suitable kind of clothes for yourself and your kids.

, Buy them lovely hats, scarves, gloves, mittens, jackets, umbrellas, socks and boots that match their ages, these can be used to cover their face area, and to supply them with warmth.


Meanwhile; making them wear layered clothes will keep them warm enough, cotton inner clothes and socks are perfect to absorb any kind of moisture and keeping it away from their skin, they also have to be kinda loosen to allow normal blood circulation.
The outer clothes layer should be waterproof in order not to absorb water from rain or something, however; if they happened to get wet; you have to change them immediately before reaching the inner layer too.
Mittens are considered to be better to use than gloves as they don’t separate their fingers away from each other, they supply them with warmth while keeping them next to each one, you can double your child’s socks to provide him with extra warmth layer, especially if the outer sock is made of wool.

, Always keep your children warm, and hydrated with water and warm drinks they love, and always ask and check with your eyes for any frostbite or frostnip early signs, like very cold skin, whiter or itchy skin, and make sure to warm them up once being detected to prevent other subsequent frostbite steps or signs."

Understand the first stages of frostbite.,
Know what happens during the next stage of frostbite.,
Be aware that cellular damage starts to occur at this point.,
Recognize the differences between light and severe frostbite.",How to Treat Frostbite in Children4," While continuous exposure to very cold weather; the first action of the body is to order the peripheral blood vessels located at the body’s extremities to undergo vasoconstriction, this narrowing in their lumen decreases the blood flow to the skin layers, while keeping it to nourish and ensure that vital organs (Brain, Heart, Lungs and Kidneys) are still functioning.


This would make your child to feel cold and to have a cold skin if was touched, that’s why frostbite mainly attacks extremities like hand fingers, leg toes, nose, ears, cheeks, and chin, the decrease in the peripheral temperature would allow the body to keep his internal temperature to keep the vital organs.
Till this stage it can be called a “Frostnip” and can be still treated at home, symptoms would appear like having a degree of white skin, tingling sensation, then numbness.

, While exposing to freezing climate is still running; the body takes another step aiming to minimize the damage happening at the affected extremities by making vasodilatation to the peripheral blood vessels for a while then returning back to constriction, blood going to the extremities supplies them with oxygen and other nourishment to keep them functioning as much as possible.


However; the return back is clearly with a fall in its temperature as a result of being exposed to the outer cold climate; this leads to its returning to the internal vital organs causing an additional decrease in the internal body temperature causing another situation called Hypothermia which is the decrease in the internal body temperature less than 98.6 F or 37 C.
This is the point when the brain detects the initiation of hypothermia and decides no more peripheral dilatation, ordering a permanent vasoconstriction at the extremities and announcing the starting of frostbite.

, This stage concludes the starting of the cellular damage resulted by the sharp shortage in heat, nourishment, and oxygen at the extremities, while skin cells and tissues scream for the three mentioned above; dehydration become to form another problem and directly cause capillaries membrane lining damage that causes fluids leakage outside of cells.


This can cause swelling of the affected tissues, redness and numbing, the skin also would be dry and hard, in a re warming trial; the blood flow would gradually return back to injured extremities through the damaged blood vessels that would allow some of the circulated blood to escape to the near soft tissues, this would affect the velocity of the running blood especially in the small tiny vessels, that may lead to the formation of blood clots, this complication can easily cause further irritation to the already damaged tissues that can increase the inflammation and swelling there.
The symptoms at this point (re warming stage) are said to be very painful as blood is trying to circulate back through the injured vessels, pain, aching, tingling and swelling are all can be seen here, throbbing sensation can persist for few days or weeks depending on the damage degree, in addition to the discoloration of the skin into a black bluish color due to the trapped leaked blood, the degree of damage can be determined here by doctors when parents follow the first aid steps for frostbite to their children to allow re warming before heading to the hospital to seek medical help by their doctor.

, Light frostbite would show signs like feeling cold, having tingling or itching sensation then numbness, skin appearance would tend to have a white color but frostbite degree or damage is still said to be superficial, this can be proven by parents or doctor’s pressing with their finger on the affected skin finding it giving some resistance indicating that deep layers are not damaged yet.


On the other hand; deep frostbite with continuous cellular damage is manifested by numbness ended by a complete sensation loss, with noticeable skin swelling and black bluish skin discoloration, finger pressing would show hardness of the skin with no resistance indicating great chances that deep layers have already undergo a degree of damage, skin blisters can be seen after the first 24 hours of cold exposure.
Note for other similar conditions with frostbite that are known to have milder damaging effect to the affected skin, examples are like Frostnip as we mentioned before, with another difference of being lighter in making damages; that its signs resolve once applying first aid procedure and re warming, with no skin damage in the future.
Another condition is called Trench foot that mainly affects the feet and toes, causing their redness, swelling, associated with pain or numbness sensation, this condition is widely seen within adults and children at home in winter, especially people with weak peripheral circulation."

Wear eye protection.,
Wear hats.,
Get added protection.",How to Protect Your Eyes in Winter1," Even on cloudy days, exposure to harmful ultraviolet radiation can be high. To prevent damaging your eyes, wear sunglasses or goggles when outside during the winter.Goggles are best when snowboarding, snowmobiling, skiing, or engaging in other high-speed winter activities. Ask your optometrist to recommend goggles based on the specific winter activity (or activities) that you engage in, as they might be able to recommend goggles designed for a particular use.Regular sunglasses are best when skating, shoveling snow, or just walking about during winter. Choose wraparound frames to more fully protect your eye.Only wear eye protection that has been rated at least 99% UV-absorbent.;
, A hat with a wide brim can help keep the sun out of your eyes. In fair weather, you might wear a baseball cap or a variation with a wide brim. In cooler weather, you could put a baseball cap on, then place a warmer wool or knitted cap on over it to keep your head and ears warm., Some contacts now offer UV protection. Certain eyeglasses, likewise, can block UV rays and/or transition naturally to a darker lens when in the presence of bright sunlight. If you wear contacts or glasses, talk to your optometrist about getting extra UV protection in your daily eyewear.For instance, you might say, “I am interested in getting some added UV protection for my eyewear. Can you help?”

Use a humidifier.A humidifier is a small device used to add moisture to the air.,
Take special measures if you wear contacts.,
Limit allergens.,
Treat dry, itchy eyes with eye drops.,
Consult your optometrist.",How to Protect Your Eyes in Winter2," If your eyes are dry from exposure to cold winter winds or from spending too much time next to a warm furnace, you should place a humidifier in your home and office.The humidifier you select should be up to the task. For small spaces (up to 300 square feet) and medium spaces (300-500 square feet), use a small portable humidifier. For larger spaces, you’ll need a larger humidifier.When shopping for humidifiers, check the information label to discover what size space they were intended for.
Perform cleaning and maintenance on your humidifier as directed by manufacturer directions.

, Wearing contacts during the winter can dry the eyes out even faster than they might normally dry out. Use a lubricating or rewetting drop if you wear soft contact lenses. These are similar to regular eye drops, but specially formulated for people who wear contacts.Consult manufacturer directions for information regarding use with your soft contact lenses.

, When your house is sealed up tight against the cold of winter, you might be at greater risk for an allergic reaction that causes your eyes to become inflamed, itchy, or irritated. To limit the likelihood of such a situation, check the filters on your heaters. If necessary, change them according to manufacturer directions.Dust and vacuum your home regularly throughout the winter to protect your eyes from winter allergies.
An air filtration system might also be useful if you typically experience winter allergies. Place it in your home or office to improve the quality of your winter air and protect your eyes.
If you do experience an allergic response that affects your eyes, use eye drops.

, If dry winter air gives you dry eyes, an over-the-counter eye drop product can reduce irritation.These eye drops only treat dryness and itchiness. They will not protect you from UV damage.


Check manufacturer instructions for more information about how to use your eye drops.
Eye drops might also be referred to as “artificial tears.”
Ask your optometrist what type of drops are best for you.

, If you’re worried about protecting your eyes in winter, or if your eyes are extremely dry, bleary, or irritated during the winter, talk with your optometrist. They might have additional suggestions for you based on your medical history, or they might be able to detect some other factor that is causing you trouble with your eyes during the winter.For instance, in conversation with your optometrist, you might say, “My eyes are extremely dry during the winter. Is there anything I can do to prevent them from getting so dry?”

Avoid spending much time outside on snowy days.,
Get more omega-3.,
Stay hydrated.,
Keep your eyes clean.,
Look for alternatives to eye-drying medications.One side effect of many medications is dry eyes.",How to Protect Your Eyes in Winter3," When snow covers the ground, it reflects almost 80% of UV radiation. This radiation bounces right back into your eye, causing the same damage it would if it entered your eye directly. To avoid this added UV exposure, limit the time you spend outdoors on snowy days.For instance, instead of spending all day outdoors when snow covers the ground, limit your outdoors time to no more than a few hours each day., Omega-3 fatty acid is an essential nutrient for good health, and low levels of omega-3 have been linked to dry eye syndrome.In the winter, it becomes even more important because it helps your body produce tears that keep your eyes hydrated.Fish is the most common source of omega-3, and is available in tuna, sardines, trout, salmon, mackerel, and herring. You can also get it in:algae
flax seed and flax oil
omega-3 capsules
walnuts
pecans

, One of the best ways to keep your eyes from getting dry during winter is to drink water and stay hydrated. If your eyes continue to dry out in the cold winter weather, increase your liquid consumption.Hot soup is a great way to increase your liquid consumption and also stay warm.
Avoid drinking sweet juices, soda, and alcohol.
To stay hydrated, drink at least nine eight-ounce glasses of fluid each day if you are a woman and at least 13 eight-ounce glasses if you are a man., If you get teary or bleary-eyed when walking about in winter, wipe your eyes with a clean tissue and dispose of it when finished. Wiping your eyes with a used or otherwise soiled tissue could spread germs into your eye, leading to infection.Always wipe from the inner eye (starting near the tear duct) toward the outer eye. This reduces the risk of introducing bacteria to the tear duct.

, If you’re taking medications that indirectly cause dry eyes, talk to your doctor about alternatives that do not.Common medications that cause dry eyes include thiazides or diuretics (often used to treat heart disease), antihistamines like Claritin and Benadryl (typically used to combat allergies), and beta blockers (typically used to treat angina pectoris, essential hypertension, migraine headaches, and myocardial infractions )."

Get a safe sled to begin with.,
Require your children to sit or kneel on the sled.,
Prevent head injuries.,
Make sure the hill slide is safe.,
Look for a long runoff end.,
Make sure that stopping buffers are covered in soft materials to cushion impact.

,
Ask children to wait their turn.,
Always supervise young children.",How to Sled Safely," The sled should be easy to use, easily steerable by your child and not liable to take off without control. Plastic sheets, sliding carpets and saucers are not good shapes or styles to choose because they are next-to-impossible to control. Prefer sleds with aerodynamic shapes, seating areas, places for legs, steerable ropes etc. Ask for advice when purchasing.;
, It is not safe to stand on a sled, nor is it safe to go head first, ever. Legs should face out front when seated.

, Wear a helmet that fits. Suitable helmets include ski, hockey, or bike helmets. Make sure that they are adjusted for comfort and fit over snow clothing. Helmets can and do prevent serious injuries if accidents happen.

, The slide should be:


Free of debris
Soft and snow-covered
Free of icy cover
Gentle in its slope
Free of vegetation, rocks, and other obstacles, including trees

, This allows for plenty of space to bring the sled to a halt before hitting the end.

,, Always wait for a clearance in other sledders going down before taking your turn. Accidents from pile-ups are painful and potentially highly injurious.

, An adult should always be in attendance for all children 12 and under who are sledding.

Get out your winter clothes.,
Set a reasonable budget.,
Go to the store and pick out everything you need.,
Dress in layers.,
Choose your shoes according to the weather.,
Use your purchased items.",How to Stay Warm and Prevent Frostbite1," First, check to make sure that the clothing you have fit. If they don't, you may donate them to another family member, friend, or charity, or sell them for a good price.
, Pick a store where you can find winter clothing that will keep you warm, are stylish and comfortable, fit you, and will last., Sweaters, shawls, long sleeved shirts, and a warm and comfortable coat that you like and is affordable. Also consider getting a hat, scarf, mittens, gloves, and a high quality pair of boots made for cold weather.

Choose outfits one size larger than what you normally wear, considering that you may be dressing in multiple layers.

, Wear shirts under a sweater and a tank top under the shirt for a very cold day. You can wear leggings underneath your pants and more than one pair of socks., If it's cold with snow and ice, wear sturdy winter snow boots. If it's cold without snow and ice, you can still wear those boots mentioned above, or you can wear furry boots like Uggs., W hen you go outside, wear the winter coat you purchased, along with the hat, scarf, and gloves (if it is very cold, wear mittens underneath your gloves)."
"
Limit your outside exposure.,
If a blizzard or other severe winter weather arrives, seek shelter.,
Eat and drink warm foods and beverages.",How to Stay Warm and Prevent Frostbite2," Try not to be outside for very long to prevent frostbite, depending on how cold it is. If you do develop frostbite or hypothermia, be sure to seek medical attention immediately., If you know you can't find shelter and know you're going to get stuck outside, call for help or flag somebody down., Try cocoa or hot chocolate and eat steaming soups or casseroles.

Dress warmly.,
Cuddle up under blankets.,
Use a hot water bottle.,
Consume warm foods and beverages.,
Take hot baths.,
Utilize your body heat.",How to Keep Warm During Winter1," Warm clothing, especially when it's layered, not only prevents exposure, it also helps retain body heat.


Wear a warm hat and thick socks. We lose most of our body heat through our head, hand and feet.
Layer your clothing. Long underwear is thin, so it fits easily under most everyday clothing, including jeans and shirt. Bundle up with a fleece or a woolen sweater for extra warmth.
Wear comfortable pajamas, thick socks and heavy clothing while you are inside a private house.;
,


Keep blankets on your couch so that you can wrap yourself up while reading or watching TV, and get extra blankets to sleep with.

, Water retains heat for a long time, making hot water bottles an affordable and effective way to stay warm. You can use one while sitting at your desk or watching television, and a water bottle under the blankets will keep your bed warm through the night.

, Delicious winter soups and hot cocoa are part of the fun of the season. Hot tea and coffee, and substantial foods like pizza, meat and toast will keep your body warm as well.

, They're a nice way to relax your muscles, especially after a stressful day, and can warm you up in no time. If you really want to relax, add some candles and soothing music. Be sure to dry off well afterwards.

,


Find a place to get cozy, wrap yourself in army-style 100% wool thick blankets and slowly but surely your trapped body heat will warm you right up!
Get up and get moving! An active body heats up quickly – run, dance, jump until you break a sweat. You can jump for a few minutes, ride an exercise cycle or dance to your favorite music. And if you don’t mind being a little cold at first, a mile’s walk around the neighborhood will get you sweating pretty quickly.
Use other people’s body heat: big holiday parties warm a house quickly, thanks to the body heat generated by the many guests. Snuggling also works, so cuddle up with your honey. Don’t have a honey? Maybe you’ll meet someone beneath the mistletoe at that holiday party!

Weather-proof your house.,
Warm up your room by shutting windows, doors and curtains.

",How to Keep Warm During Winter2,"

Patch up any drafty areas you might have in your house.
Prevent cold from coming in through windows with double-paned glass.






Make sure the rubber strip at the base of your door is nice and tight, so that cold air can’t blow through.
If you have a fireplace, keep the flue closed. Cold air can blow in from the chimney.
Build a fire. Both fireplaces and campfires keep you nice and toasty. If you do build a fire, be sure to open your flue, so that the smoke can escape through the chimney.






Candles also generate warmth, however, they are a major fire hazard, so use them for illumination, rather than warmth.

Be aware of the triggers that encourage Africanized honey bees to attack, so that you can avoid provoking an attack.,
If bees start attacking, don't freeze.,
Protect your face as you run.,
Run into the wind.,
Avoid getting into water.,
Run to a building shelter.,
Use any cover on hand if you cannot find shelter.,
Take stock once inside shelter or when you have outrun the bees.",How to Escape from Killer Bees," Some of the things that can encourage attacking by Africanized honey bees include hive disturbance, causing the bees to think that the hive is under threat, and a range of sensory threats such as loud noise, strong odor or artificial fragrance, shiny objects (including jewelry) and dark clothes. If you do spot a hive in your yard, camping ground, or when out for a walk, take care and consider the following precautions:


Avoid making loud noise when you discover a hive. Don't shout, don't use machinery near the hive (such as chainsaws and lawnmowers), and keep barking dogs away.
Avoid disturbing a hive. Don't poke at it. It's the bees' home and they'll do what they need to defend it. Leave it well alone and call for professional hive removal help.
Don't wear strong perfume, shiny jewelry or dark clothing when in an area known for having Africanized bees.;
, Run away quickly. Do not stop to help other people unless they are small children or they are disabled. Call out to encourage everyone in the vicinity to run to shelter. Run in a straight line - most healthy people are capable of outrunning Africanized bees as they are slow fliers.


If you see someone being attacked by bees, encourage them to run away or seek shelter. Do not attempt to rescue them yourself. Call the Emergency Services to report a serious stinging attack. The emergency response personnel in your area probably have been trained to handle bee attacks.

, Use your shirt pulled over your face or your arms but do not let this slow your running. Protect your eyes and sensitive head areas. If you are holding an infant then keep their face tucked directly into your body so that the bees cannot get at their face.


Do not swat at the bees or flail your arms. Bees are attracted to movement and crushed bees emit a smell of bananas that will attract more bees.

, This makes it harder for the bees to keep pace with you., Killer bees will wait until you come up for air., Do not stop running until you reach shelter. While some bees will follow you indoors, you should be able to shut most bees outside. Those that have followed you in will be disoriented by the lights in a well-lit room and will fly to the windows.

, Use blankets, sleeping bags, clothes, get into a tent or a bivouac, anything that can cover you up and provide shelter. Running through bushes or high weeds might also help provide some cover. If your car is close, it can serve as suitable shelter.

, Rest a moment to catch your breath, check who else has made it back with you, and attend to injuries and allergic reactions:


Remove all the stingers. When a honey bee stings, it leaves the stinger in your skin. While this kills the honey bee by tearing apart its abdomen, the venom continues to enter into the wound for a short time.
Do not pull stingers out with tweezers or your fingers. This will only squeeze more venom into the wound. Instead, scrape the stinger out sideways using your fingernail, the edge of a credit card, a dull knife blade or other straight-edged object.
If you have been stung more than 15 times, or you're feeling ill, or if you have any reason to believe you may be allergic to bee stings, seek medical attention immediately. The average person can safely tolerate 7-10 stings per pound of body weight; this means that although 500 stings can kill a child, the average adult could withstand more than 1100 stings.A person allergic to bee stings, however, is at great risk of anaphylactic shock from even a single sting, so seek immediate medical advice.

Call the police. Tell them what has happened so that they can arrange for professional beekeepers to come and contain the swarm.

Use a plastic tub or aquarium for housing.,
Fill the container with grass and dirt.,
Make sure the container is well ventilated.",How to Care for Pillbugs1," As pillbugs require a damp environment to thrive, you should pick a container that's resistant to water. Go with something made of plastic or glass rather than cardboard.


You can purchase an aquarium at a pet store if you have a lot of pillbugs.If you don't want to spend the money on an aquarium, you can use a plastic tupperware container from your kitchen to house your pillbugs.;
, Once you've secured a container, you can begin creating the proper environment for your pillbugs.


Fill the bottom of the container with one to one and half inches of moist soil or sand. You can purchase sand or soil from a pet store or greenhouse.
Pillbugs also enjoy wood bark, leaf litter, and other dead vegetation as part of their habitat., Pillbugs need to live in a ventilated container. Make sure you're able to place small holes on the top of the container, but not too big that pillbugs can escape. Many aquariums come with ventilated lids and you can easily poke holes in the top of a tupperware lid.

Find out when the drill will occur.,
Wear layered clothing.,
Leave gloves near the door of the classroom.,
Arrange with several people to form a huddle.",How to Stay Warm During an Evacuation Drill1," Finding out the time is crucial. You cannot prepare to stay warm if you don't know when the drill will take place. Listen to morning announcements, look on bulletin boards or wherever you school announces important events. It also helps to know what subject you'll be in. Bear in mind you may not be able to find out the exact time (e.g., 9:00 AM) but only the date (e.g., October 5th).;
, Even a tank-top under a shirt can help you stay much warmer. Wear several layers of clothing, and bring a hoodie/sweatshirt to put on the back of your chair. It could be slightly large to use the ""Staying warm with a sweatshirt"" technique below.

, As you evacuate, you can grab the gloves without having to go to your locker (good if you're not allowed to go as you evacuate.)

, Conserving body heat is a good way to stay warm. It is also a good source of entertainment. You can talk in whispers.

Get out of bed.,
Pick clothes for the day.,
Take a shower.,
Dance.,
Eat.,
Keep warm.,
Pick the right outerwear.",How to Keep Warm on a Cold Winter Day," To make this as pleasant as possible, you should put on your thickest socks, slippers and your bathrobe (It’s also a good idea to wear pajamas while you’re sleeping, that way you won’t get cold when you wake up and have to put on your socks, slippers and bathrobe).;
,


Underwear. If it’s really cold, you should consider wearing thermal underwear. If it’s not that cold, you can use the same underwear that you normally use.
Socks. You can use the same socks as you wore when you woke up, or you can use some thinner ones if you are going to be wearing winter boots/shoes. Stockings is an option.
T-shirt or thin sweater. Optionally you can wear a blouse or a top. The only thing you want to check, is that whatever you choose is long enough so that your stomach won’t show (and thereby get cold).
Sweater. Or maybe you want to wear a shirt or a poncho? The great thing about sweaters is that they can be used over practically anything; a t-shirt, thin sweater, blouse, top and even a shirt. A poncho can also be a good option, since they can be really warm. The only negative thing about ponchos, is that it can be too big to fit under your jacket.
Trousers. If you’re going to be wearing jeans, you should consider wearing stockings or tights under them (especially if you’re going to be wearing skinny jeans). If you’re going to stay at home all day you should wear something comfortable, like sweatpants.

, We all have different routines, and preferences when it comes to showering. Some people like to shower in the morning, some like to do it in the evening, etc. One of the most important things about showering in the winter, is that you know how to keep warm after you’re done. Well, first you have to take a shower. Use hot water, and make sure you have a towel ready for when you come out of the shower. Your towel should be hot and dry before use. Try putting it in the dryer right before you shower. When you’re done, you should give special attention to your hair, and get it as dry as you can. If your hair is thick or long, you can use a blow dryer to get it fully dried. Alternatively to showering, you can take a hot bath. That way you’ll relax you muscles, plus it is a great way to end the day.

, As we all learn at school, you have to be in activity in order to burn calories. When you burn calories, you will get warm. The activity you choose to do is entirely up to you, since the important thing is not how but that you get warm. Dancing is just one of many activities you can do. If you choose dancing though, which is both fun and healthy, you should listen to upbeat music. Dance like you’ve never danced before, and have fun while doing it.


You don’t have to be inside in order to be in activity, there is actually even more stuff you can do outside. Before you go outside, you should check the “Pick the right outerwear” step further down.

, Your body needs food in order to keep you warm.



Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and even more so in the winter. When you eat, your stomach will convert the calories in your food into energy. Make some hot coffee, cocoa or tea, and enjoy your meal.
Dinner is served, and what are you eating? Chicken soup! What a great choice. Not only is it warm and delicious, but it goes so well with bread or dinner rolls too.
Supper, supper, supper. What are you going to eat for supper? It’s best to keep it light, since it’s the last meal of the day. Not only is tea great for breakfast, it can help you calm down after a long cold day too. You should not drink cocoa or coffee though, since sugar and caffeine will keep you awake.

,


If you have a radiator in your house, it should be on at all times. If you don’t have a radiator, or you still think your house is cold, you should use your fireplace. Make sure to never leave the house while there is still flames inside it. If you have to leave the house you have to put out the flames first.
If your house is just a little bit cold, you can use a blanket to keep warm.
A great way to get your bed warm and ready for you to sleep in it, is by using hot water bottles.
Make sure that your duvet is thick enough, so that you don’t wake up freezing in the middle of the night.
Candles can actually give warmth, plus it can make your house super cozy. Just remember, like with the fireplace, that you can never leave the house while they are still burning.

, This is the most important step. In order to keep warm in the winter, you can’t be wearing just a thin jacket and jeans. You may think that it doesn’t matter what you wear, as long as you look cool, but this is not the case. You can actually freeze to death. So, what is more important; looking good, or staying warm and alive?


Jacket. Make sure to use one that is made for the winter, not some thin summer jacket. It doesn’t matter if it’s a bubble jacket or a trench coat made for winter, as long as it keeps you warm.
Shoes. High boots, low boots, boots with wool inside, converse with wool inside. Remember that it’s your feet that does all the walking, but never gets to move themselves. They are just stuffed into your shoes, with no way of moving the way your arms and hands are. That’s why you have to keep them warm.
Gloves. In the winter, your hands are exposed to both extreme warmth and cold. Your hands gets really cold if you don’t wear gloves, and then you have to go inside and wash them in very hot water. This is bad for your skin, and you can end up with dry hands.
Scarf. A thick scarf can make all the difference, especially on windy days.
Winter hat. Most of your body heat disappear from your head, so in order to “keep it inside”, you have to wear something on your head.

Feed pillbugs a healthy diet.,
Keep the container humid.,
Replace soil periodically.,
Handle pillbugs with care.",How to Care for Pillbugs2," Pillbugs eat mostly decomposing vegetables in the wild and should have a similar diet in captivity to keep them healthy.


Pillbugs can safely be fed fish flakes, which you can purchase at a pet store.In addition to fish flakes, feed your pillbugs leftover bits of apples, lettuce, potatoes, and carrots. You can also bring leaf litter in from the wild and feed them to your pillbug.While you can feed pillbugs food that has been sitting out for a few days, do not offer them moldy food. This can make them sick., Pillbugs require a humid environment to survive.


Invest in a humidity thermometer to make sure your pillbugs environment is adequately moist. Pillbugs should not live in an environment of less than 75% humidity. They will not survive without proper humidity.Mist the container once a day with a spray bottle. Also, make sure to add water to the soil on a daily basis. You can also place a damp cotton ball or paper towel in the container. Just make sure your pill bugs don't eat them!

, Waste gases emitted by pillbugs can be strong enough to cause health problems, so soil should be replaced periodically. Make sure you remove all the pillbugs before changing the soil. If your pillbugs have reproduced, babies may be difficult to differentiate from soil. If this is the case, put a piece of wood in the container as babies are likely to congregate there.

, Most pillbugs can be handled easily, but you should do so with care.


Gently pick pillbugs up with your thumb and forefingers when you want to handle them. You can also scoop them up with a spoon.
Make sure not to drop your pillbugs while handling them, as this can cause them pain. They walk fairly fast and can sometimes fall by mistake.
Never handle pillbugs while they're shedding.

"
"
Do not mix different species.,
Keep mold out of the enclosure.,
Periodically clean containers.",How to Care for Pillbugs3," Pillbugs might not be well being mixed with different species. Make sure any bugs you add to your tank are also pillbugs.


Pillbugs have flattened, round bodies, sharply rounded antennas, and seven pairs of legs. When frightened, they roll into a tiny ball., Due to the dampness of a pillbug's environment, you need to make sure their container is mold free. You can do this by periodically switching the soil, as stated, and removing any uneaten food before it becomes moldy.

, As containers can grow moldy due to soil, periodically switch your pillbugs into a new, temporary container. Clean the container with soap and water and rinse thoroughly. Then, re-add soil, leaves, and water and put the pillbugs back inside.

Pull your sweatshirt over your legs.,
Pull your arms out of your sleeves and tuck your hands under your armpits.,
Cinch up the hood as much as possible.,
Cross your legs.",How to Stay Warm During an Evacuation Drill2," Crouch down on the ground, then pull the bottom of your sweatshirt over legs. Additionally, tuck your head between your legs. Realize that this may stretch your sweatshirt, and possibly ruin it.

, Your armpits are the warmest part of your body. Cross your arms and place them between your legs and your chest.

, This helps keep your face warm, as well as warming up the air you breathe. It also limits the amount of warm air that leaves and cold air that enters.

, This will keep you even warmer. However, unless your sweatshirt is large, you may not be able to fit.

Cross your arms, and put each hand on a shoulder.,
Hunch over.,
Rub your arms briskly.,
Do not hold your arms away from your body.",How to Stay Warm During an Evacuation Drill3," Assume the ""I gotta pee!"" position. Crossing your legs limits the amount of heat that escapes your body.

, Stick them inside your shirt, and bring them as close to your chest as possible to preserve body heat.

, Extend your palms as far around your biceps and triceps, to cover as much open flesh as possible.

, The more compact you are, the less heat you release. Tuck your chin onto your chest, curve your back, and bend your knees.

, This creates friction. (Incidentally, the same thing used to create fire because it gives off heat!) Though keeps you warm for only as long as you continue to do rub your skin, you will stay significantly warmer during this time.

, Doing so allows much more heat to escape than when you have yourself all bundled up into a ball.

"
"
Bundle up as mentioned.,
Bounce from foot to foot.,
Do jumping jacks.",How to Stay Warm During an Evacuation Drill4," Put your arms inside your shirt and tuck your hands under your armpits.

, Moving slightly back and forth uses more energy than standing still and also generates more heat.

, For this, you'll have to take your arms out of your sleeves. Do the jumping jacks as fast as you can, but make sure to stay hydrated. Being cold and thirsty is never good.

Ward bears off by making regular noise, either with a bear bell or by traveling as a group.,
Keep your eyes up for signs of bears, taking detours as needed.,
Stay away from ""kill sites"" or carcasses.,
Leave the pets at home.,
Purchase necessary bear repellents, such as pepper spray and bear proof canisters.,
Understand the basics of bear behavior to know when situations are escalating.,
Know your bears.,
Check into the office or park ranger station for the latest news and updates.",How to Escape from a Bear1," If you can prevent an encounter with a bear, the rest of the steps are unnecessary. Bears are reclusive creatures, and they generally prefer to steer clear of humans. You can help them to do so by announcing your presence when you’re exploring their home environment: talk loudly, sing, or carry ""bear bells"" so bears have time to escape you.


There are very few records of bears ever attacking a group of people, so stick together.
When alone, making noise or having a bear bell is a near essential, especially if there have been reports of bears nearby.;
, If you see bear tracks, make a detour or leave the area. Avoid surprising bears -- if you see one in the distance, keep your ground and stay away. Let the bear move on before proceeding. If a bear changes its behavior because of you, then you are too close.When you actually see a bear, you want to reduce your noise. Be calm and quiet, letting it stay about its business.
This is especially important with young, ""harmless"" bears. A mother may be nearby, which can spell big trouble. Even if bears seem sick or hurt, stay clear and call a ranger.

, Bears will defend two things -- their young, and their most recent meal. If you find any carcasses, especially fresh ones, give them a wide berth and immediately leave the area., Bears know a lot better than to mess with humans, and they will rarely see you as a food source. But your dogs may not be so fortunate, especially if they regard the bear as a threat. No matter how well you think your dog is trained, leave it at home when traveling in bear country.


If you must have your pet with you, make sure they are leashed -- no exceptions., Come prepared to both avoid bears and deal with them in the rare case that they become agitated. Remember that, when camping, both food and food waste need to be contained, as the smell of wrappers and remains can attract the animals., Bears are not quite as unpredictable as everyone claims they are. Like humans, they have a variety of maneuvers and body language ticks that can help you read the situations and react appropriately.


Standing on it's back two legs is a sign of curiosity, not aggression.
Bears generally want to retreat -- they are known to posture and feign aggression to avoid a fight. Stay calm.
Bears are not always hyper aware -- they can get distracted, which makes it doubly important to announce your presence with noise as you hike., The steps you take to survive an encounter with a bear will depend in part on the type of bear. North America has three kinds of bears: brown bears, black bears, and polar bears. Polar bears, of course, are easily recognizable, and their range is limited to the far northern latitudes. Grizzlies and black bears cannot necessarily be differentiated by their colors. Grizzly bears can weigh up to and over 800 lbs., and they are distinguished by a prominent shoulder hump and a rump lower than the shoulder. Black bears are typically smaller (up to 400 lbs.), and have a rump higher than or at roughly the same level as the shoulder. If you see tracks, grizzly bears have claw marks well separated from the paw imprints, while black bears’ claw marks will be quite close to the paw imprint.

, Has their been a recent bear sighting, or an increase in bear activity around campgrounds? The rangers will know exactly what's been going on in the park, and can give you up to date advice about avoiding any confrontations. Be sure to check in as you arrive to ensure you're up to date.Be sure to heed local bear advisories and practice proper food storage techniques while camping. Each park is different -- some require bear canisters, some raised bear bags, and some just want the food locked in the car.

"
"
Stay calm, and do not ever run.,
Keep your distance, stepping sideways away and keeping your eyes on the bear.,
Announce that you're human by speaking in a low, calm voice.,
Make yourself as big as possible with hands, clothes, and high ground.,
Give the bear an escape route, always.,
Understand the bear's motivations.,
If the bear seems to escalate and get aggressive, get aggressive in response.",How to Escape from a Bear2," Running signals to the bear that you are prey worth chasing, and they are incredibly fast animals. Screaming or yelling will spook the bear into believing it is threatened. As hard as it may seem, keeping cool, calm, and collected will always be your best bet.

, If you see a bear from a long distance (greater than 300 feet), leave the area. If you need to continue on, make a wide detour around the bear. If the bear has not seen you, do not disturb it: retreat calmly and quietly, and then make ample noise when you are well away to prevent future chance encounters. But if you're up close and the bear notices you, stay calm and keep your distance, shuffling sideways to avoid tripping and keeping your eyes up., It doesn’t matter what you say, but say something as you retreat to the sides, keeping an eye on the bear. Your goal is to communicate to the bear that you are human (i.e. that you can defend yourself and are not frightened) while also letting it know that you are non-threatening, and that you are leaving its territory.


Never yell, scream, or make high-pitched noises!
Pick one phrase or mantra and just repeat it calmly: ""There is nothing to fear, I am not here to cause harm,"" or something similarly calm and simple. It's not the words that matter, of course, but the tone and the fact that you keep saying them., Again, you must do this calmly and slowly. If the bear sees you and is closer than 300 feet (91.4 m), or if the bear is approaching you, remain calm and try to look as large as possible. Stand your ground and try not to look frightened. Some things to do include:


Open and spread your jacket wide at your sides.
Slowly raise and wave your arms, indicating that you are human and not prey.
Continue talking in a low, calm voice.

, If you've cornered the animal, get out of the way quickly but calmly. Remember that most bears are posturing and don't actually want to fight, but if the only way out is through you, they're going to take their chances. Immediately provide a pathway allowing them to escape.

, A little bear psychology can go a long way—your response to an attack should be shaped by the bear’s motivations. First, if a bear appears to be stalking you (disappearing and reappearing, for example), or if a bear attacks at night, it most likely sees you as food, and any attack will be predatory. If you surprise a bear on the trail, if the bear has cubs, or if the bear is eating from or protecting a carcass, the bear will most likely be acting in self-defense.


A bear attacking as a predator, no matter what type of bear, should be fought off. These bears are often desperate, but know that these attacks are extremely rare.

, If you are sure this attack is meant to see if you're prey (and only then), you should get louder and bigger. Stamp your feet, wave a walking stick menacingly, and or bang some pots and pans. Let it see that you aren't worth the effort. That said, don't hit it until it comes after you and makes contact. Never forget that their first charge is frequently a bluff-- hold your ground, but don't look meek.


Again -- this is not the norm. Predatory bear attacks are extremely rare, and you must read the situation appropriately.

"
"
Stand tall, even if the bear charges you.,
Sidestep advances if they're closing in within a relatively short distance (<8 feet).,
Only play dead with brown bears or grizzly bears after they've made contact.,
Fight back against black bears if they start to attack and make contact.,
Know how and when to use bear spray.",How to Escape from a Bear3," Running cues the bear to chase you, and it will always be fast enough to catch up. Do not be aggressive, but do not crouch down, play dead or otherwise show fear or vulnerability. If the bear charges you, muster all your courage and stay where you are: the charge is most likely a bluff, and if you stand your ground the bear will turn away., Bears and other 4 legged animals have a wider center of gravity, and hence can't make turns quite as sharp as you or me. Don't just run in circles however, but if engaged in an open area (plains or field), do not run directly away from the bear as they're generally faster. Move left and right where applicable to force the bear to change direction. Do not abuse the bear, however, as it drains vital energy.

, If the bear (other than a black bear) is attacking you in self-defense, you can put it at ease by playing dead and lying completely flat on the ground. Do so only after the bear makes contact with you or tries to do so. To play dead, lie flat on the ground protecting your vital parts with the ground, and your arms protecting your neck with your hands laced behind the neck. If you have a backpack on, keep it on to defend your back. Keep your legs together and do not struggle.


Once the bear leaves your immediate vicinity, wait 10-15 minutes before carefully looking to see if the bear is still around. A bear may look back and may return if it sees you moving.
Remember -- if you believe this is a predatory encounter, as the bear has approached you or been following, you'll need to change course and fight back., Remember, this is not if they charge alone -- this may be a bluff. If a bear charges and makes contact with you, however, you need to fight back with whatever you can. Focus on kicks and strikes to the face and muzzle in particular to scare it off. The odds may seem against you in a fight, but bears generally do not see humans as prey, and a bear that makes a predatory attacks is usually immature, starving, or wounded, and may easily be scared away if you hit it.If you believe any attack is predatory, such as an attack at night or if you've been ""stalked"" throughout the hike, fight back immediately -- this is usually a bear desperate for food., If you get charged by bear, stand your ground and unclip the safety clip and put a cloud of spray in between you and the bear. Squint and hold your breath. Good aim doesn't matter so much as a layer of protection, giving you plenty of time to escape. Begin spraying when the bears is 10-20 yards away for the greatest effectiveness.


Keep spraying until the bear changes direction. If the cloud doesn't work, hit it right in the face.
You should practice quickly and easily getting your spray out of it's holster before hiking."

Trap the mosquito in a cup.",How to Avoid Mosquito Bites," A variety of specially-formulated insect repellents are available for sale at camping or sporting goods stores. Apply insect repellent to uncovered skin surfaces when outdoors, especially during the day. When using sunscreen, apply it before insect repellent. Here are a few common chemical solutions effective at repelling mosquitoes:


Repellents containing 30% to 50% DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide) are recommended for adults and children over 2 months of age and effective for several hours. Repellents with lower amounts of DEET offer shorter-term protection and must be applied more often.DEET can irritate skin when applied directly in high concentration or for long periods of time. It can even cause severe skin reactions in certain individuals.
Despite rumors to the contrary, DEET has never been scientifically proven to cause cancer.Repellents containing up to 15% picaridin, which must be applied often, are available in the US. Repellents with higher concentrations of picaridin may be available in some regions outside the US.;
, Experiment with non chemical solutions such as Citronella (natural plant oil). Tea tree oil and vitamin B have reportedly helped some people repel mosquitoes. As with any product, their effectiveness depends on the situation, your own skin chemistry, and the exact type of mosquito you are dealing with. Note, however, that so-called ""alternative"" solutions sometimes aren't held to the testing standards that mainstream commercial repellents are - research alternative solutions and read testimonials before spending any money.

, One of the best ways to keep mosquitoes from biting you is to simply cover your skin. Wear your sleeves and pant legs as long as possible to cover as much skin as possible. Also keep your clothing as loose as possible. This serves two purposes: first, it's much more comfortable in the hot,humid weather where mosquitoes thrive. Second, mosquitoes can sometimes bite through clothing that's held tight against the skin, especially if the fabric is thin.


If you have the money, camping and sporting goods stores often sell specially-designed pants and shirts made out of strong yet lightweight material. These clothes offer maximal protection from mosquito bites along with a relatively high level of comfort.
Clothing may also be sprayed with repellent containing permethrin or another EPA-registered repellent for greater protection. (Remember: don't use permethrin on skin.)

, These have been shown to kill many bugs very effectively but generally the bugs killed are the non-harmful ones. Plus, the noise they generate tends to be obnoxious. Mosquitoes can be more effectively killed by one of the dedicated machines that use heat and carbon dioxide to attract the mosquitoes and then entrap or kill them using nets, containers or chemicals.

, The mosquito netting has fine holes big enough to allow breezes to easily pass through but small enough to keep mosquitoes and other biting insects out. Hang the netting over your bed, securing the top of the net to one or more surfaces. Support the net so that it's tented without hanging down onto you. Make sure to sleep without touching the sides - mosquitoes can actually bite you through the netting if it's tight against your skin. Check for holes regularly - patch them with duct tape for a quick fix..


Protect infants less than 2 months of age by using a carrier draped with mosquito netting with an elastic edge for a tight fit., Unfortunately, mosquitoes live on every continent except Antarctica. However, they're generally more common in warmer, wetter areas, which tend to be close to the equator. If you really want to avoid mosquito bites, stay out of tropical climates entirely.


Mosquitoes are especially common in jungles and swamps in Central and South America, South and Southeast Asia, Sub Saharan Africa, and Oceania.
If you're unsure about whether it's safe to travel to a certain part of the world, visit the Center for Disease Control (CDC) Malaria Travel Information website.This site gives a country-by-country breakdown of malaria prevalence, as well as any noted malarial drug resistances.

, Mosquitoes are often attracted to water, especially standing water, so lakes, stagnant creeks, bogs, marshes, and swamps are mosquito havens, especially during hot months. Most species of mosquitoes lay their eggs in stagnant water and some have even adapted to lay their eggs in salt water.Stay away from any bodies of stagnant water, whether they're small puddles or vast swamps, to reduce your risk of encountering mosquitoes.


Many species of mosquito stay fairly close to where they hatch and breed. If you can give these wet, standing areas a wide berth, you'll avoid these species entirely.

, It's easy to unintentionally create habitats for mosquitoes to live and breed in. For instance, a kiddy pool left out in the summer sun for several days can soon become a hotbed for mosquitoes. Get rid of any standing water around your home or campsite. If you have a pool, cover it when it's not in use and treat the water with chemical additives like chlorine according to the manufacturer's instructions. Here are just a few places water can accumulate:


Discarded tires or industrial containers
Construction ditches or trenches
Pools
Natural low points on a piece of property
Clogged storm drains

, In the tropics, differences between seasons are minimal, so mosquitoes are able to thrive in warm weather year-round. In temperate areas, however, mosquitoes are only active during warmer months. In colder periods, mosquitoes hibernate and new adults do not mature past the larval stage. For example, parts of the American Midwest have cold, snowy winters which eliminate mosquitoes entirely, but also have hot, humid summers, which cause mosquito populations to swell. ""Mosquito season"" varies depending on the locale - generally, it's the hottest and/or most-humid part of the year.


Another seasonal factor which can influence mosquito populations is flooding. Some parts of the world, like Egypt's Nile River, experience periodic flooding. Standing water from the flooding can cause a dramatic boom in mosquito populations.

, This advice is especially important if you're in a hot, humid climate. Mosquitoes are thought to be attracted to warm bodies,so staying cool is one way to avoid bites. Dark-colored fabrics absorb more heat from the sun than light-colored alternatives, so avoid them. Also avoid excessive exercise when possible. Not only will exercise cause you to radiate heat, it will also cause you to breathe heavily. Carbon dioxide, one of the gasses you exhale, can be smelled by mosquitoes even at relatively long distances., Unless you practice this a great deal, you will find it hard to accomplish and the air of your moving hand gives the mosquito plenty of warning, and can even blow it out of your grasp.

, The swatter, usually made of a thicker metal or plastic, is mounted on the end of a springy wire, dramatically increasing your chances of hitting a stationary mosquito by increasing the momentum of the swat. You can also use your hand in a similar flipping motion.

, Using two hands is more effective than one, as the air coming from each hand will blow the mosquito into the opposing palm.

, There's an urban legend that says you flex your muscle or stretch your skin tight as a mosquito bites you, its proboscis will get stuck in your skin and it will drink your blood until it explodes. There isn't any scientific research to support this claim. Even if you can get this method to work, you'll still be left with an especially big bite and you'll still be putting yourself at risk for malaria, West Nile virus, etc. If you're trying to avoid mosquito bites, why kill the mosquito by letting it bite you?

, If the above steps aren't working or the thought of killing a mosquito makes you feel guilty, you can try catching a mosquito alive, then releasing it outside of your home or camp. Slowly place a cup (preferably made of a hard material) over the mosquito and then slide some paper underneath this cup. This gives you control over the mosquito and can provide you with a more pacifistic approach, instead of just killing the mosquito. Carefully hold the paper over the cup's bottom as you relocate the mosquito to a more appropriate habitat.

Clear away any snow that’s on top of the ice.,
Keep rock salt away from plants and pets.,
Sprinkle rock salt evenly over the ice.,
Splash some warm water around on the salt.,
Wait for the ice to soften.,
Shovel the melted ice off of the driveway.",How to Remove Ice from a Driveway1," Using any kind of deicer is pointless if there is snow piled on the ice. Use a snow shovel to push the snow off of the ice before you do anything else. You don’t have to get the snow completely off, but try to get it down to two inches (5 cm) or less.If you have a plow that attaches to a four wheeler or tractor, it’s much faster to clear the snow this way.;
, Rock salt contains chemicals that are harmful to animals and plant life. When you spread the salt, make sure not to throw any on the grass or plants near your driveway. Also, make sure that your pets do not eat the salt if you have them outside., You’ll need about four pounds (1.8 kg) of rock salt per 1000 square feet (93 square meters) of driveway. Scoop up the salt with an old plastic cup and slowly shake it out over the surface of the driveway. Don’t pile too much salt on any specific spot.The freezing temperature of saltwater is lower than that of regular water, so this is the basic principle that causes salt to melt ice.
If you have a push behind rotary spreader, like the kind you’d use for yard fertilizer, fill it with salt and use it to spread the salt quickly and evenly.
Calcium chloride pellets and magnesium chloride pellets can be substituted and applied in the same fashion.

, Letting the salt sit on the ice will melt it slowly, but adding warm water to the mix will speed things up. Fill a spray bottle with lukewarm water and mist the entire area where you laid the salt. Simply pouring water from a jug would work too, but it will distribute the water unevenly.This is not necessary if you are using calcium chloride pellets or magnesium chloride pellets.

, Thin ice will probably melt in 5-10 minutes, but for thicker ice you’ll need to wait longer. It could take up to 30 minutes or so. If it’s below freezing outside, you should wait inside to keep warm. Check the ice a couple of times until you notice that it has melted., To completely remove ice from the driveway, use a metal snow shovel to scrape off the slush that remains. If you leave the mostly melted ice on the driveway, there’s a risk of it freezing again.If you are in a hurry or it’s obvious that the ice has totally melted to water, don’t worry about shoveling off the slush.

Remove snow from on top of the ice.,
Fill a spray bottle with 70% isopropyl alcohol.,
Spray the alcohol around on the ice.,
Shovel the melted ice off to the side.",How to Remove Ice from a Driveway2," If you have ice on your driveway, you probably have some snow too. Any method that melts ice will melt snow, too, so you can’t effectively remove the ice if you don’t remove the snow first. Push it off of the driveway with a plow or snow shovel., Grab a spray bottle that’s at least a quart (about one liter) or a half gallon (about 2 liters). Add the alcohol and put the spray nozzle back on. If you want to make the alcohol last longer, dilute it with water to a 50/50 ratio.Note that diluted alcohol may be slightly less effective at melting the ice.
If you don’t have a spray bottle, carefully use a sharp knife to poke four or five holes in the cap of the alcohol bottle and spray the alcohol in this way.

, Walk from side to side on the driveway, spraying the alcohol as you go. If you’re able to bend over, hold the bottle about a foot away from the ice so it hits it more directly. If the alcohol runs out before you cover the driveway, refill the bottle and continue., After you leave the alcohol sitting on the ice for 15 to 30 minutes, grab a sturdy metal snow shovel. Break up the ice and push it off to the side of the driveway. In a pinch, you don’t have to shovel it off, but you risk it freezing again."

Install some snow-melt mats.,
Pour or spray hot water on the ice.,
Mix water and vinegar in a watering can.",How to Remove Ice from a Driveway3," You'll find many ice-melt mats on the market. Many are systems that are installed under the driveway, which may be more expensive. Some mats may allow you to lay them out on top of the ice to melt it., Use a pot on the stove or an electric kettle to boil as much water as you can safely carry outside. Pour the water around on the ice to melt it. If you have a metal watering can, this is a great way to spread the water around.If you have a way to attach a hose to the hot water in your house, this is a great way to spray down the icy driveway.
You may need to shovel the melted icy slush after you pour water on it.

, Use a ratio of 1:1 of warm water and vinegar. Once you have mixed it up in the can, pour it around on the ice. Let it sit for a few minutes to start melting the ice. Use an ice chisel or a heavy metal shovel to chop up the melting ice."

Obey all posted warnings at the beach.,
Avoid swimming at dawn, dusk, or night.,
Avoid swimming in cloudy or murky water.,
Stay away from shark food sources.,
Stay near to the shore.",How to Avoid Sharks1," The single best thing you can do to avoid ever seeing a shark is to simply pay attention to any and all safety information at the beach. Heed any posted signs and listen to the instructions of authority figures like lifeguards, beach patrol personnel, and park rangers. If certain activities like diving, kayaking, surfing, and so on are prevented in the water, don't do them. These rules exist to keep you safe.


Sometimes, authorities make the decision that the easiest way to protect beachgoers is to keep them out of the water entirely. Though it can be disappointing to go to the beach and learn that it's been closed, don't try to disobey these rules. Their goal is not to ruin your good time, but to save lives.;
, Most sharks hunt at these times and are naturally more active and aggressive when hunting.Stay out of the water at these times to avoid encountering a shark when it is likely to be hungry and actively searching for food.


In addition, you are at a big disadvantage in the water when it's dark out. Since you have close to zero visibility, you are unable to see any sharks that you do come across. On the other hand, since sharks' other senses are more powerful than ours, they can navigate very well in the dark.

, Just as lack of visibility during dawn, dusk, and nighttime can make you extra-vulnerable to shark attacks, so too can water conditions that limit your visibility. As noted above, sharks have powerful senses besides their vision that can lead them to prey even when it's hard for them to see. Since humans lack these senses, we're much more likely to be taken by surprise by sharks in low-visibility water. Give yourself the best possible chance to see danger coming by swimming only in clear, non-turbulent water.

, Sharks are more likely to be where easy sources of food are. To keep your chances of encountering a shark at a minimum, stay far away from these places. Areas with commercial fishing activity can be especially dangerous, since fishermen sometimes use pieces of chopped up fish as bait, which can inadvertently attract sharks. In general, flocks of diving sea birds are a good indicator that there is food in the water.You'll also want to stay away from anywhere that nutrients, effluent, or waste products are discharged into the water (like, for instance, a sewage outlet that pours directly into the sea.) Not only is this likely to be a little healthier, but also safer, as the sharks are more likely to hang around such areas of water looking for food.
If you are fishing, don't dump dead fish or fish pieces into the water. These make easy pickings for shark, which can detect blood at concentrations of as little as one part per million., Sharks that are big enough to pose a threat to humans generally stay in deeper waters off the coast. By staying in relatively shallow water and away from the ""dropoff"" area at the deep end of most beaches, you decrease the likelihood that you'll encounter a shark. Should you come across one, you'll still be able to get to safety on the shore easier.In addition, you'll want to avoid the areas between sand bars — sharks can sometimes make their way into these narrow channels.
Obviously, it can be hard to stay out of deeper water if you're doing activities like surfing or kayaking. In these cases, be sure to take all of the other precautions in this article to stay safe.

"
"
Never swim alone.,
Avoid making yourself look like shark prey.,
Keep your bodily fluids away from sharks.,
Avoid excessive splashing or thrashing.",How to Avoid Sharks2," When hunting, sharks are more likely to single out lone, isolated individuals for attacks than they are to go after a large group.While sharks are unlikely to go after humans in general, swimming in a group can improve your chances even further. Don't let yourself drift away from the people you're swimming with — stay a few paddle's reach away from each other at all times.


This general rule isn't just a smart idea for deterring shark attacks — it's also a very important beach safety rule in general. Any swimmer, no matter how strong, may be vulnerable to drowning if he or she encounters unexpected currents or conditions. Swimming in groups (with at least one person on the shore at all times watching the swimmers) can save lives., As noted above, sharks don't naturally hunt for humans as a food source, opting instead for local fish and other underwater wildlife.However, in rare cases, sharks may mistake human swimmers for animals that they naturally prey on, like fish, seals, and sea lions. Luckily, by being careful about what you wear, it's possible to avoid this confusion. See below:


Sharks are thought to be attracted to some colors more than others. Bright colors seem to attract tropical sharks. Yellow is particularly attractive (some divers even call it ""yum yum yellow"").. It is thought that wearing mainly darker colors that don't contrast greatly with the underwater surroundings can help prevent shark attacks. This is true for fins as well.
Don't wear shiny objects. Before swimming, take off any jewelry, watches, chains, gear, etc. that is metallic, shiny, reflective or glowing. It is thought that these can attract sharks by resembling the shiny scales of a fish.
If possible, avoid surfboards. It is thought that sharks can confuse their streamlined shapes for a large fish or seal.

, Sharks have very strong senses of smell (though not as strong as movies and TV may have made you believe.) Some sharks have such a powerful nose that they can detect a single drop of certain chemicals in an olympic swimming pool.For this reason, you will want to avoid swimming in the open water when you are likely to ""leak"" any bodily fluids that the shark may be able to detect. See below:


Stay out of the water if you have an open wound, especially one that is actively bleeding. Menstruating women should use caution.
Don’t urinate, defecate, or vomit in the ocean. Stay out of the water if your are likely to need to do these things (for instance, if you are sick.)

, While hunting, sharks are on the lookout for weak or wounded prey — the easier they are to catch, the better. To a shark, a human who is wildly splashing around in the water can look a little like a wounded animal. For this reason, especially when you're in deeper waters, you'll want to avoid frequent, animated splashing on the surface. If you're under the water, try to avoid violent, struggling movements as well, even if you're joking — this can also make you look like you're in distress.

"
"
Stay calm.,
Look for telltale warning signs of aggression.,
If an attack seems likely, adopt a defensive position.,
If attacked, fight!,
Get out of the water and assess your situation.,
Don’t ever bother or harass sharks.",How to Avoid Sharks3," Remember: shark attacks on humans are rare, so simply seeing a shark does not necessarily mean that it has targeted you. Chance meetings with sharks that are on the hunt for other food or simply swimming from point A to point B are perfectly possible. Don't react tensely or frantically to the sight of a shark unless you have to — as mentioned above, making wild movements and large splashes can attract its attention and make it think that you are a wounded animal.


Instead, stay calm and focus on your immediate goal: getting out of the water quickly, quietly, and smoothly.Resist your natural instinct to make a mad dash to safety unless the shark is aggressively following you.
If you are fishing in a small boat when you notice a shark, let any fish on the line go and move away.
If you are diving at significant depths, surfacing quickly can be dangerous and should be used as a last resort. Instead, release any fish or bait you have with you and move laterally away from the shark. Exit the water at a reasonable pace once you are away from it., As you make your exit from the water, try to keep an eye on the shark if possible. Watch its body language — aggressive sharks tend to act noticeably different from non-aggressive ones. If you see the following signs, move more quickly as you try to get out of the water and get ready to defend yourself if necessary. Movements that indicate a shark might be ready to attack include:Making quick, sharp turns while swimming.
""Hunching"" or arching the back.
Circling, especially if the circles get tighter
Charging
Lowering the dorsal fin (the one on the back)
Rubbing the belly against the sea floor
Showing other sudden or erratic movement.

, In the very unlikely event that you are attacked by a shark, you will almost always fare better if the shark is not able to take you by surprise. If you see the signs of aggression listed above, keep your eyes on the shark and make an effort to use even, steady movements as you continue making an exit from the water. If you have anything you can use to defend yourself, grab hold of it. If you can, put your back to a reef, wall or other object to limit the shark's angles of attack. Most importantly, get ready to fight back.


If you are near other people, it's also crucial to call out to them for several reasons. Not only will this notify them of the danger and give them a chance to themselves — it can also help you. Statistically, there are few cases of rescuers being attacked when helping someone else get away from a shark. It's thought that suddenly encountering a second person in the water can spook a shark enough to make it run away., Playing dead once a shark makes a decision to attack will do you no favors. This can make the shark think that you're defeated, which is what it wants, and may encourage more bites. On the other hand, if you make yourself appear strong and dangerous, the shark may go off to find easier prey. Remember: sharks aren't usually used to prey that puts up a serious fight — the majority would be much happier chasing an easy fish than a human who's willing to punch, kick, and gouge.


Try to strike the shark's eyes and gills with whatever you have. These areas are the most vulnerable, pain-sensitive parts of a shark. Punch and claw at them repeatedly until the shark lets you go.
Contrary to popular myth, the nose is not as good of target as the eyes and gills. It's less sensitive to pain and is also right next to the mouth, which is the last thing you want to stick your hand into.
If you're diving, use any tools you have, like a diving knife or even a spare tank to hit the shark.

Don’t stop fighting. The goal is to convince the shark that attacking you is more trouble than it is worth. Giving up will just make the shark's job easier.

, As soon as you can after a shark attack, get out of the water and stay out, even if you don't think you have any injuries. The adrenaline pumping through your body may make it difficult to judge how hurt you are at first. Getting out of the water (and staying out) doesn't just keep you out of the shark's reach, but also gives you a chance to determine what to do next with a reasonably level head.


Get medical attention for any injuries immediately, even if they don't seem serious. This is extra important if you are bleeding — since it is more difficult for your body to stop bleeding underwater, you may already have lost a significant amount of blood.Don't get back in the water even if the shark seems to have left and you have no injuries. The only reason to get back in the water (provided you are uninjured) is to save them from a shark attack — as mentioned above, some sharks may flee when dealing with a group of people, rather than just one.

, This advice should go without saying. Almost any animal that is taunted, harassed, or chased will eventually defend itself. Sharks are no exception, though their deadly predatory capabilities make the consequences for mistakes much higher than with most animals. If you do see a shark, exit the water and leave it alone. Never do anything to provoke a shark, even if you think you are in a safe location, like on a boat. Accidents can still happen.

Be vigilant when camping.,
Be responsible for all children by you.,
Obey the warning signs!,
Note the striking distance of a rattlesnake.,

Review these steps before every encounter with rattlesnake territory.",How to Avoid a Rattlesnake Attack," Is it a rattlesnake or a different kind of snake? To be safe, if you don't know, don't hang about to find out and if you cannot see without getting closer, don't even consider edging in any closer. But if you are aware of what the snake looks like, it might be helpful for a number of reasons, the main one being to know what to do if it does bite you or someone in your group. From a safe distance, look for:


A flat, triangular-shaped head (although this may not be adequate to mark it) — broader at the base of the head than at the front.
Heavy-bodied
Openings between the nostrils and eyes — these are the heat-sensing pits
Hooded eyes and elliptical pupils — these may not be readily apparent and you'll have to be fairly close to see this.
Coloration — generally tan and brown patchwork; the Mohave rattlesnake is green, however, and has light bands at its tail end. If you can see these bands with the naked eye, you are probably too close.
A rattle at the end of its tail (made of modified scales). Young rattlesnakes often have only a few parts of the rattler formed — be wary of this as the bites of newborns are still venomous. Rattles may also be broken off, malformed or silent. Do not rely on the rattler as the only form of identification. Listen to the rattler sound courtesy of the San Diego zoo: Rattlesnake Sound Byte.;
, You are most likely to encounter rattlesnakes when you are hiking, climbing, camping, or even walking to see a tourist monument.


Most rattlesnakes prefer hot environments, with some preferring desert climates but others, such as the Eastern Diamondback, prefer a moist climate. The majority live in the southern United States and Mexico, although some are found in Canada's Badlands desert region in Alberta and in British Columbia around Hedley, Keremeos, and Osoyoos.
Rattlesnakes like summer evenings the best, just as the sun is going down and when it has gone — they are most active nocturnally in summertime. This just happens to coincide with the frailty of human eyesight kicking in as the sun goes down, so take care. Use a flashlight when walking about and wear good footwear.
Rattlesnakes like warm days, period. Be it any season of the year, even winter, a rattlesnake can venture out in search of the warmth — suitable air temperature for rattlesnakes is around 70° and 90°F (21° to 32°C).
Most rattlesnakes are not generally sitting about in the open — if they are in the open, they are moving through it much of the time. Rattlesnakes want to avoid contact with predators who can easily spot them in the open, including humans and large animals. As such, you will most likely encounter rattlesnakes around rocks, shrub and brush, or wherever there are nooks for them to hide among. However, on sunny days, you might find rattlesnakes warming themselves on warm rocks or asphalt.

, When in rattlesnake country, do not be blasé about clothing — the majority of bites occur on the hands, feet and ankles. So, apart from not sticking your hands where they shouldn't be, clothing becomes an important protection ally:


Toss the sandals — this is time for good quality, thick hiking boots, and decent socks. Over the ankle boots are best, as ankle bites are common. Do not wear sandals, open-toed shoes or bare feet when walking in the desert. There are more things than rattlesnakes awaiting your foolhardiness if you do.
Wear long, loose-fitting pants.
Use gaiters if possible, especially if you choose not to wear long pants.

, When in rattlesnake territory, think like a rattlesnake to keep your mind on how they might behave so that you can behave accordingly:


Always hike with at least one buddy. If you are alone and bitten, you will be in dire trouble. Carry a cell phone that works and alert family or friends of your intended hiking course and duration.
Stay out of the way. The easiest way to avoid rattlesnakes is to keep out of their way. Keep alert as you hike, walk, and climb. Stick to well-used trails and do not wander off into tall grass, underbrush and weeds where rattlesnakes may be hiding.
Do not stick your hands in the wrong places. Don't stick your hands down holes, under rocks and ledges or even into brush when you are walking around. These are key hiding places for rattlesnakes. When hiking, it is best to carry a sturdy staff, or at least a long, sturdy and light stick, to help prevent using your hands in areas where snakes may hide.
Don't sit down on tree stumps or logs without first checking inside. You might just be sitting on a rattlesnake....
Step on and not over. When you need to cross logs and rocks, it is sensible to step on the objects rather than straight over them. This way, you can spot a rattlesnake that may be sheltering under it and can take evasive action quickly.
Look before you leap. Take care where you land your feet. A foot coming straight down next to, or on top of a snake is asking for a bite. Snakes rely on vibration to hear and while they can sense you coming if you have stomped about loudly enough, they cannot deal with removing themselves fast enough if you blaze up a trail quickly and provide little warning of your approach.
When walking, carry a stick, and whack bushes and undergrowth a bit before you walk on/near them, and snakes will get away. They'll go under bushes or thick grass immediately, so don't put your feet in/on those places! If you must step on those hiding places, probe them a bit first with your stick, so the snake has a chance to get away.
Move out of the way. If you do walk into the range of a rattlesnake, calmly back off as quickly and quietly as you can.
Take care around water. Rattlesnakes can swim. Anything resembling a long stick might be a rattlesnake.
Do not provoke a rattlesnake. Angering a snake will result in one response — you become its target. Remember — a snake is defending itself from attack in such a case and if you poke it with sticks, throw stones at it, kick at it or do silly little jigs around it, you are asking for trouble. And worse still, there may well be a difference in the venom between an angered rattlesnake and one reacting quickly in self-defence — the toxicity may be increased, whereas a surprised rattlesnake may only bite without injecting venom (possible, not certain). Whatever the strength of the venom, an angered rattlesnake will be more likely to keep striking.
Leave the snake alone. Many people are bitten in the process of trying to heroically rid the world of one more bothersome snake. Apart from the snake not being bothersome, the snake is going to bite you to try to defend itself. Live and let live — back off and let it have its space to slither away. And be warned — there is a reason for the saying ""as mad as a cut snake"" — an injured snake is a very, very dangerous foe.

, There are risks during camping that you need to address.


Check the campsite before setting up. Arrive in daylight and set up in daylight. On warm nights, rattlesnakes may still be hanging about and if you cannot see what you are doing, you are at risk.
Shut the tent flap at night if camping in rattlesnake territory or you may wake up to a very unwelcome surprise. Always check before going to bed that an unwanted guest isn't already lodged inside, attracted by warmth or the interesting hiding possibilities presented by a tent.
Make sure all those using the tent keep the flap constantly shut when entering and leaving.
Shake out sleeping bags before hopping in. Many an unwary sleeper has been unpleasantly awoken.
Take care collecting firewood. Piles of wood are an ideal hiding place for rattlesnakes.
Use a flashlight at all times during night walks.

, Children are naturally curious and bold all at once. While useful in a safe environment, these traits can lead to harm in a dangerous environment. Make sure that young children understand the dangers of rattlesnakes, know what not to do and know how to behave to avoid a rattlesnake encounter plus how to behave if they do encounter a rattlesnake. In a party of hikers with children, an adult should always lead and preferably another should bring up the rear.

, This means those of the snake and those of any humans in charge of warning you of the presence of rattlesnakes:



Recognize the signs of a rattlesnake about to strike. These are general, sometimes there may be a strike without these signs because a rattlesnake can bite from any position if needed:

A rattlesnake in a coiled position — the coil permits the rattlesnake to make its most effective strike
The front end of its body (head) is raised
Its rattler is shaking and making rattle sound


Just to make life a little more difficult, it is important to be aware that rattlesnakes do not or cannot always use their rattler to warn of impending attack. For instance, if you tread on it before it has time to rattle, it'll bite first and leave rattling until later. And sometimes they just don't rattle, for such reasons as being extra defensive during shedding, mating and giving birth. Or, they may prefer to rely on their coloration as camouflage, only to realize that this isn't going to protect them from the impending human feet. Also, wet rattlers do not rattle. There must be at least two segments of a rattle for it to be capable of making sound, therefore young rattlesnakes cannot make the rattle sound until this grows but they remain venomous all the same. Be aware of these possibilities. Otherwise, if you hear that rattle, you are clearly forewarned, so back off.
Heed the signs from park rangers and other park authorities. Like the sign in the photo, when you are warned by the local park authorities that rattlesnakes are in the area, take the appropriate precautions set out above.

, A rattlesnake's strike distance can be up to one third to one half of its overall length. It doesn't pay to underestimate a rattlesnake's length, however, and a rattlesnake might strike farther than you would expect. The strike of a rattlesnake is faster than the human eye can follow.

, If you do get bitten by a rattlesnake, while serious, the most important thing is remain calm and still — dashing about moves the venom about faster. Key elements are remaining calm, remaining immobilized and getting to a hospital as quickly as possible. This helps prevent the spread of the venom. Keep the bite lower than the victim's heart (do not elevate the bite; that will increase circulation and spread the venom more rapidly), wash affected area and remove any potential constrictions such as rings (when swelling occurs constrictions could cause loss of blood flow and necrosis of tissues). For more on the procedure of dealing with a rattlesnake bite, see How to Treat Snakebite.

, Share the information with those traveling with you to alert them to the need to be cautious, calm and considerate of what may be about.

If you see a bull in a pasture or field with cows, avoid going in the field at all costs.,
If you absolutely must to go through the field be aware that a bull may see you as a threat and warn you to keep away.,
Be aware that, some bulls can go after you without you even aware of it until he's trying to put snot down your back pockets.,
If you absolutely have to go in the same corral with a bull, pack a weapon with you.",How to Avoid or Escape a Bull1," This is just plain common sense, even if it means having to walk the long way around to get to your destination.;
, Look for these signs:


Pawing the dirt and rubbing himself in it
Growling (it sounds something like ""Rrrrrumph...rrrrummph"")
Tossing his head
Glaring at you.
He will even show you his side to deliberately intimidate you, just to show you how big and powerful he is.
Any bull that does this to you, including growling, head-shaking and pawing the earth, is one to avoid.

, Those bulls are the ones to avoid, more so than the ones that give you the obvious warnings.

, That weapon must be a thick stick that won't break on impact, an axe handle, a one- to two-foot long piece of PVC pipe, or a baseball bat; anything that you can carry in your hand to defend yourself with or make the bull think twice about attacking you.


Also, keep close to the fence to make your escape that much easier.

"
"
Find a safe spot quickly.,
If you can't find an escape route either side-step and run for it, or hit back, hard.,
Count your lucky stars if you managed to get away without getting injured or killed.

",How to Avoid or Escape a Bull2," Run away and quickly climb or jump over the nearest fence, gate, cattle guard (also called a ""cow grid"" or ""Texas gate""), or even up a sturdy tree. Bulls can outrun people so make sure your escape route is a short one.

, The best thing you could do is if there's no place to hide or if you're out in the middle of a pasture, to either side-step the bull and run in the opposite direction, or face the bull, yell (or scream) as loud as you can and give the bull the hardest hit across the face or muzzle as you possibly can give with the weapon in your hand.


Depending on your level of adrenaline, you may find yourself doing this more than once, especially if you have the big fellow come running at you.
This may (and does) sound cruel, but it is a practice that has been done by many farmers and ranchers when they have to deal with a dangerous bull that has charged them or is about to do so!
You can either stand your ground until the bull backs off and then chase him, or hit and run. Very often a really hard hit to the muzzle or nose is enough to make him stop chasing after you!
If none of this can be had, throw the back-pack off your back as you go (if you have one), or even your shirt or jacket if you are fast enough to take it off. Be aware though, that a bull is much faster than you in both speed and reaction time, and often you won't have enough time to take your shirt off and throw it at the bull.

Dress in layers.,
Dress for the appropriate activity level.,
Buy or find a pair of insulated boots.,
Wear winter socks.,
Use a good quality coat, parka, or jacket.,
Wear a base layer.,
Wear a hat.,
Wear gloves or mittens.,
Hand warmers can be useful, especially if you don't have shelter handy.,
Wear more than one layer on your legs.,
Keep dry.",How to Dress for the Cold," Use many thin, warm layers rather than a few thick layers. It will insulate better and allow you to strip off layers if the temperature climbs.;
, Dressing for an active day of skiing will be different than dressing for a sedentary day of ice fishing.

, Ideally, the lining should be wool or synthetic--not cotton. Linings can be purchased separately. You can purchase boots already with the lining, or use boots two sizes larger than usual, and use a lining.

, Warm winter socks are important in keeping warm dry feet. Wool is best, although good synthetic ""fleece"" socks are often quite good. You can layer socks, but be careful that your feet are comfortable and the circulation isn't shut down.

, Generally speaking, the thicker the better, whether it is a synthetic ski jacket, a wool pea coat, or a down jacket.

, A ""base layer"" is long johns, union suit, long underwear, or whatever can provide a warm, light base to your winter gear. Merino wool products are recognised as one of the best base layers available.

, While it's a myth that most body heat escapes through the head, covering any exposed body part helps retain body heat.

, Fingers and hands are very vulnerable to the cold, so keep them covered. Very thin gloves (like ""magic gloves"") are better than nothing, but comfortable, warm gloves are important.

, They can be purchased at any outdoor or hunting store. Never use these as a substitute for dressing warmly, however.

, Oddly, some people will wear five layers on their torso, and only one layer on the legs. At minimum, have a base layer like long underwear and an outer layer, like snowboarding pants.

, Being wet will cause chill to set in more quickly than if you're dry. Have waterproof or at least water resistant outer layers.

Schedule play time with your child.,
Multitask.,
Ask a friend or neighbor for help.",How to Handle a Snow Day As a Stay at Home Parent1," A snow day is a fun day to engage with your child, but it is important to manage your time so you can complete your own tasks. When you child is home unexpectedly, review your schedule for the day and consider where you can make adjustments.Push back non-essential household chores until the following day to free up some time to play with your child in the snow.
Consider ordering take-out for dinner so you don’t have to spend time cooking.;
, Juggle your responsibilities and spend time with your child by multitasking. Perhaps you can complete your telecommuting work while your child watches some morning cartoons or their favorite movie. Have your child work on an art project at the kitchen table while you complete some work next to them on your laptop. Your child will enjoy working alongside you.

, If you have a lot of work and need some time to yourself to complete it, consider asking a friend, a family member, or a neighbor for help. Ask a friend if they would like to babysit and offer to provide them with lunch and dinner. Call a neighbor and ask if your child and theirs would like to play together for a few hours in the afternoon. Your child will be entertained and supervised while you are able to complete your tasks.

Your child can build and decorate a snow man for a fun snow-day project.

, Push the coffee table out of the way, grab a stack of sheets and blankets, and have your kids build a fort in the living room. Use clothespins to clip sheets together and drape them over kitchen chairs, the back of the couch, or the dining room table. They will have a great time designing and building their fort, and afterward they will have a cozy space to play and read all afternoon., Instead of gathering around the table when it is lunch time, opt to have an indoor picnic instead. Pack a basket or a bag with some apple slices, carrots, a sandwich, and a bottle of juice and water. Lay a large blanket out in the middle of the dining room floor, or deliver the lunchtime goodies into their indoor fort., Let your child stay in their pajamas all day and watch their favorite film. Pop some popcorn and hit play on their favorite movie. They’ll be excited to be watching their favorite Disney movie instead of sitting in their usual grammar lessons.

, If it is too cold to go outside to play in the snow, grab a bucket and bring some of the snow inside. Fill the bathtub with snow and let your child dig, build an igloo, or take their favorite toys on an arctic adventure. When play time is over, simply let the snow melt and run down the drain., Making foam dough is simple way to whip-up a fun and entertaining activity to pass a snowy afternoon. Mix equal parts corn starch and shaving cream in a mixing bowl. Let your child mix the ingredients with their hands, and add a few drops of food coloring to brighten up the dough. The mixture creates a light, fluffy, and sandy mixture that your child will have fun playing with for hours.The foam dough is very messy, so make sure you keep your child in the kitchen while they play. Lay some garbage bags around their feet to catch any foam that may fall to the floor.

They’ll have fun creating pictures, writing their name, or just scribbling with blue, purple, or green sprays onto the bright white snow., If you have some hills in your yard or your neighborhood, grab a sled and zoom down the hill with your child. If you have younger children, sit on the sled with them as they go down. Your child will feel like they are on a winter rollercoaster.

, Let your child take care of the animals during their snow day by feeding the birds. Hollow out an orange by carefully slicing off the top with a knife and scooping out the pulp with a spoon. Once it has been hollowed out, pierce the skin with two sticks and push them all the way through to create four quadrants. Tie some string from each of the sticks, and secure it to a tree branch. Have your little one fill the orange with birdseed.Consider placing the birdfeeder near a window where you and your child can watch the birds enjoy a snack.

, Grab a bottle of bubbles and take them outside when the temperatures are below freezing. When your child blows the bubbles, they should immediately freeze on the wand."

The snow day will feel extra special when your little one gets to skip their usual oatmeal or cereal and enjoy their favorite breakfast dish instead.

, After a long afternoon of playing in the snow, let your child warm up with a cup of hot chocolate. Let them add a little bit of whipped cream or marshmallows on top, or sprinkle in some cinnamon or cocoa powder for extra flavor. Have them stir the rich drink with a candy cane stick.

, Making snow ice cream is a special, delicious way to spend a snow day. To make this unique treat, blend a ½ cup (4 fl oz) of whole milk, ¼ cup (50 g) of sugar, and a ½ tsp (5 ml) of vanilla extract until the sugar dissolves. Add 4 cups (32 fl oz) of clean snow to the mixture until it has a similar consistency and texture to real ice cream. Serve in a bowl with your child’s favorite toppings, or mix in some fresh strawberries, blueberries, and bananas.To ensure that the snow is clean, place an empty bowl on your porch or window sill as the snow is falling. The bowl will collect the clean snow, and all you will have to do is grab it and toss it in with your other ingredients.

Start with lots of layers.,
Layer t-shirts and long-sleeve t-shirts, and top with a sweater or sweatshirt.,
Put on some long-johns or tights under your pants.,
Put on your snow pants.,
Put on your scarf.,
Wear a good winter coat; this is an invaluable investment.,
Put on sturdy mittens or gloves.,
Cover your feet with one or two pairs of thick wool or polyester-wool mix socks that can be pulled up to the calf of your leg.,
And finally, a tip your mother has been telling you for years: A good hat really can make the difference between staying warm or shivering in the cold.,
Now go take down your opponent in a snowball fight!

",How to Bundle up for Warmth," Make sure your shirts are long enough to adequately cover your stomach and hips.;
, It is best if these layers are easily removable, too.


Don't put on too many layers that you won't be able to freely move your arms around! Sometimes only two or three layers is sufficient, depending on how cold-resistant you are. Often a thick sweater over a T-shirt or two is good enough for added warmth.

, This can be optional if you a pair of thick snow pants to put on that is cold resistant to -30 C, like those WorkKing or Carhartt type snow pants or overalls.

, Your legs are more prone to get chilled and frozen than your upper body, even if you are moving them around a lot.

, Ideally, a nice thick scarf should be worn underneath your coat as an extra layer of protection at the neck. It should not let any air in from your chin to the your chest.


Depending on the wind chill outside, you can wear your scarf so that it just covers your neck, or so that it acts as a face protection as well as covering for your neck.

, Down or a synthetic replacement is optimal, but if your coat is quilted, thick, and closes at the wrists, waists and neck, you'll be fine.


Make sure the coat is tested for winter, not for cooler days like late fall or early winter.

, Gloves are obviously best if you'll be taking part in an activity where your dexterity is important--driving or snowball fights, for example. Either tuck your gloves into your sleeves, or pull them tight over the sleeves, but do not let any room for air or snow to get it in.

, Cover with a pair of high, waterproof, insulated winter boots.

,


The hat you wear should be one that will not let the cold or wind through to your head very easily. .

Purchase a deicer.,
Use the right product correctly.,
Sprinkle a small amount of deicer on the icy sidewalk.,
Shovel the ice off your sidewalk.,
Lay down a second layer of salt.",How to Clean Ice off a Sidewalk1," You should be able to find these at your local hardware store. It is best to buy several bags at the beginning of the season. Once the first snow storm hits, it is possible that stores will sell out of the product.You should store your deicer in a dry place, preferably inside an airtight container keeping it free from moisture and sunlight.These are largely made of rock salt, or sodium chloride, which has a lower freezing point than water. This allows it to seep through the ice, breaking it up and creating a layer of water beneath it.;
, Deicers can be harmful to your health, your sidewalk, your lawn and your pets. Don’t use too much of it, and sweep it up after the ice has thawed. If you feel the need to use more than 2-4 ounces per square yard, you may be using the wrong product for your purposes. Ice melts function at a variety of temperatures and melt at different speeds.Hygroscopic ice melt removes moisture and can be severely damaging to skin and sidewalks.Some of these products involve more chemicals than others. Urea is sometimes included in the mixture, but can cause damage to your sidewalk.
Calcium chloride will melt ice at even lower temperatures than salt mixtures without it. It can function at -20 degrees Fahrenheit, whereas salt is only good down to 15 degrees Fahrenheit. This is useful for melting ice quickly when you need it on stairs or walkways, but will need to be reapplied often.
Rock salt takes longer to melt the ice, but will not require being reapplied as often. Use this in areas used less often, like driveways.

, It is not necessary to use a lot of salt. Create a thin layer of salt on top of the ice. You want to use about 2-4 ounce or 1-2 handfuls per square yard.It is best to sprinkle this layer of salt as soon as it starts to snow. Once the ice gets thicker, it will be more difficult for the salt to be effective.
The salt should start working in 15-30 minutes. It will not melt the ice, but should have seeped through and made a layer of water between the ice and the sidewalk, as well as breaking up the layer of ice and making it easier to shovel.

, Now that the ice has been broken down, it should be easy to break apart and remove with a snow shovel. Tap the tip of the blade of the shovel against the ice to break it apart.


Holding one hand on the top of the handle and the other down another foot or so along the length of the shovel, wedge the blade under the broken ice.
Scoop the shovel under as much ice as you can and lift it off the sidewalk.
Turn and tip the load of ice over to the side of the sidewalk and continue shoveling until it is cleared.

, You can use salt before, during and after a snowstorm. Laying down a layer after you complete your shoveling will help keep more ice from forming. If the snow continues or returns, you will already have your deicer working at the lower level to make future ice removal easier."

Fill a gallon jug with warm water.,
Add dish soap.,
Finish the mixture with rubbing alcohol.,
Pour the mixture onto the ice.,
Shovel the ice.",How to Clean Ice off a Sidewalk2," You will want to fill the container half way for a total of 1/2 gallon of warm water. Don’t worry about making the water very hot. It should still be cool enough to handle., Using whatever liquid dish soap you have handy, squeeze six drops of dish soap into the gallon jug. Gently roll your wrist to mix the soap into the water without making it foam.

, Measure out 2 ounces of rubbing alcohol. You can use an alcohol jigger for an accurate measurement. Add these two ounces of rubbing alcohol to the gallon jug.Rubbing alcohol, or isopropyl alcohol, can be hazardous. Take precautions when handling it. Avoid contact with skin by wearing gloves. Don't touch your face after handling rubbing alcohol. Wash your hands with a lot of soap and water., While the water is still warm, pour it generously over the ice which you would like to remove. The solution will break down the ice and make it easier to shovel., You will want to remove the ice safely and efficiently. This means getting the ice and snow out of the path for walking and driving without hurting yourself in the process.Use a lightweight snow shovel which is not too heavy for you.
Decide where you will pile the snow and ice before you start so that you don’t end up blocking a walking or driving path and needing to start over in that area.
Ideally, just push the snow and ice out of the way without lifting it.
If you do lift, keep your knees bent and back straight. Remember to do the lifting with your legs and only lift as high as necessary to move the ice to your pile. If you are turning, turn your whole body instead of twisting at the waist.

Choose a heavy duty machine.,
Break up the ice.,
Read the owner’s manual.,
Plan your route.,
Start your snow blower in a ventilated area.,
Move the snowblower slowly over the area you are clearing.",How to Clean Ice off a Sidewalk3," Snowblowers can possibly handle some ice and save your back from shoveling injuries. If there are chunks of ice mixed in with your snow, the right snow blower can handle the job.Avoid single-stage blowers which use paddles and choose a dual-stage snow blower, which employs augers. Some augers have sharper or longer teeth, which are useful in breaking up the ice.
Gas blowers tend to be more reliable and stronger than electric blowers.

, Snow blowers will not be able to remove a sheet of ice. This will likely register as solid ground and the blower will roll over it. Break up large sheets of ice with a shovel before using the snow blower., Each snow blower will come with different controls, options and instructions. Be sure that you understand all of the moving parts and how to use them by reading the instruction manual before using the blower.


Pay specific attention to how to operate the auger, chute direction, drive clutch and steering levers.
Prepare the snowblower with gasoline, oil, stabilizers or necessary extension cords.
Look for accessories which may have come with your snow blower, like blades, skid shoes and shear pins.

, Know where you want to place the snow and ice. Decide which side of the sidewalk you would like to blow and pile the snow. Never blow ice and snow toward cars, houses or other people. Don’t move the snow from your sidewalk into someone else’s path.If it is a windy day, don’t blow the snow into the wind. This will blow it back in your direction.
Avoid picking up and shooting gravel through the blower. If you are clearing a gravel surface, leave a little snow on top of the gravel by lifting the necessary blades or augers to a height which does not reach completely to the ground.

, You will want to start the snowblower outside or in an open area. If you are in a shed or a garage, make sure that the doors are open to let exhaust out., Use both hands to push the blower at a slow and steady pace, much like mowing the lawn. Follow your planned route and take care when making turns.Some second-stage blowers have power steering options to assist in making turns.
Disengage augers when making turns and make sure that the chute is facing the correct direction before starting the augers back up.
Continue pushing the snow blower over the area and making turns until the sidewalk is completely cleared.

Know what temperatures to dress for.,
Keep in mind some basic principles.,
Dress in layers.,
Keep the heat close to your body.,
Wear a pair of thick water-proof winter boots.,
Get a really good coat.,
Be sure all your outer layers are windproof, waterproof, padded and warm.",How to Dress for a Saskatchewan Winter,"

October is usually around +5C.
Winter starts around the end of October to mid November.
In November it's usually around -10C.
December could get down to -20 or -25
January and February -15 to -30
March it starts to warm back up to -15 or -10
April is usually when it goes above freezing
By May it is Spring, like +15C.
July and August are about +20 to +30C;
, In a nutshell, these are:


Dress in layers.
Keep the wind, the cold air and moisture away from your body.
Keep the heat close to your body.

, Layers are great as they allow you to dress up or down to suit the temperatures. If you are too hot, you can remove a layer and be comfortable; too cold, add a layer. It's important not to get too hot, because you don't want to sweat and become wet beneath your clothes; if this happens, the moisture can in turn cause you to feel even colder when it evaporates in the cold air.

, Next to your skin, use thin, thermal clothing to keep the heat in. Wear socks, long underwear, and an undershirt. For outerwear, wear a toque (knit hat), thin mittens or gloves, and a smaller, finer-weave scarf inside your coat, covering your chest and neck. Wrap a scarf over your mouth and nose if you are to spend several minutes outdoors, killing the chance of getting sinus infections (the cold), pneumonia, and other sicknesses.


Over the socks, wear a second pair of socks, possibly a looser fitting, thicker sock, like a wool sock. Alpaca wool is 4 times as warm as sheep's wool.You may want to wear a third pair of socks if it is really cold out.
Over the long underwear, wear jeans or thick canvas pants.
Over the undershirt, wear a long-sleeved t-shirt, then a wool or fleece sweater, preferably with a hood, and maybe another sweater over that.  
Over the toque or hat you can wear the hood of your sweater/sweatshirt. 
Over the mittens or gloves, wear leather mittens - not gloves - with sheepskin or other fur lining. Wool will work but only if it has a windproof shell layer on the outside.
Over the fine-weave scarf, wear a warm coat, then wear a generously sized knitted scarf on the outside, which is long enough to wrap around your neck and then your face twice each.
Over your pants, you can wear ski-pants, or if it is not that cold out, wind pants (unlined).

, Choose ones with good treads on the bottom, and a thick, furry or padded lining at the bottom of the sole and around the sides of the boot. You can find ones with a temperature rating of -30 or -40ºC. Those are the best choices.

, Your winter coat or parka is one of the most important pieces of clothing for your stay in the winter in Canada's prairie provinces.  It should be padded and lined, have cuffs at the wrists and a tie at the waist. Down-filled is best, and it must be wind-proof, if you will be outside for more than a few minutes. It should have a padded hood, preferably with fur around the edges. 


The hood should have a drawstring so that you can tie it around your neck. Wear the hood of your coat over the toque and sweater hood. A good hood is padded and lined, and has fur around the edges to keep the wind out. Use the drawstring to pull it close around your face and tie it. You'll be glad you did!
The coat's zipper should work well, and should be covered by a panel of cloth that stays shut, like with Velcro or buttons. This keeps the cold wind from going into your zipper.  
Your coat should be long, if you are not wearing ski pants, so that it keeps the wind and cold off your lower body. 
Ask at the store what the temperature rating is, as some companies provide this for their coats. A rating of -20ºC can be okay because you will wear a sweater underneath it. As you've noticed, you're going to wear a lot more clothing than usual, so your coat may need to be of a bigger size than you usually take!

, With all of this in place, you should be nice and warm for the winter. Stay safe. Stay warm.

, Whether the avalanche starts above you or beneath you, you may be able to make your way toward the side. Don't hesitate: move as quickly as possible to the side of the avalanche slope. If the avalanche begins well above you, you may be able to get out of its path before it reaches you. The snow will be moving fastest near the center of the flow, and that's also where the highest volume of snow will be.

, You want your body to be as lightweight as possible, so let go of your backpack, poles, and other heavy equipment you may be carrying. This raises the chances that you'll be able to stay toward the surface of the snow.It goes without saying that you should not let go of survival equipment, such as a transceiver and probe or snow shovel; you'll need these if you get buried.
People searching for you later may be able to find you if they see some pieces of equipment on the surface of the snow, so you could let go of a glove or something else that's light to increase the chances they'll find you.

, If you're unable to escape the avalanche, try to grab on to a boulder or sturdy tree. If it's a small avalanche, or if you're near the edge of the avalanche, you may be able to hold on until the flow of snow passes you. Even if you get ripped away from the object you're holding, if you can succeed in delaying your departure downhill, you have a better chance of not being buried or, at least, of not being buried as deeply.


Keep in mind that a very powerful avalanche can carry away even large rocks and trees...

, This is essential to helping you stay near the surface of the snow. The human body is much denser than snow, so you'll tend to sink as you get carried downhill. Try to stay afloat by kicking your feet and thrashing your arms in a swimming motion.Swim on your back. This way your face is turned toward the surface, giving you a better chance of getting oxygen more quickly if you get buried.
Swim uphill. Swimming up will get you closer to the surface of the snow.

, It should be pointed in the direction of the snow's surface. This will help you figure out which way is up, since it's easy to get disoriented once you're buried. It may also help rescuers locate you. Spitting out a small amount of your saliva can also help with figuring out which way is up because the fluid will run down. , Once the avalanche stops, the snow settles in as heavily as concrete. If you're buried deeper than a foot or so when it sets, it will be impossible to get out on your own. Your only hope then is to ward off asphyxiation long enough for people to dig you out.Use either your free hand or an avalanche shovel to dig an air pocket near your nose and mouth. When the avalanche slows down. With a small air pocket to breathe from, you should have enough air to last at least 30 minutes.
Take a deep breath before the snow settles. Right before the snow settles, inhale deeply and hold your breath for a few seconds. This causes your chest to expand, which will give you some breathing room when the snow hardens around you. If you don't have this breathing room, you may not even be able to expand your chest to breathe while you're buried.

, Try to move once the snow settles, but don't jeopardize your air pocket. If you're very near the surface, you may be able to dig your way out, but otherwise you aren't going anywhere. Don't waste precious breath by struggling against the snow. Remain calm and wait to be rescued.


If you hear people nearby, try to call them, but don't keep it up if they don't seem to hear you. You can probably hear them better than they can hear you, and shouting just wastes your limited air supply.

, If you hit the slopes with an avalanche beacon and probe, and your fellow skiers did the same, someone will be able to find you and dig you out. Stay calm and wait.

, There are a few pieces of equipment that greatly reduce people's risk of dying in an avalanche. Invest in the following items:


An avalanche receiver and probe. The receiver puts out a signal to show where the person is buried, and the probe is used to locate the person and start digging. Every person in your party should carry both.
A small shovel. This is used to dig an air pocket around the face.
A helmet. Many avalanche-related fatalities happen because of the initial impact of the snow knocking people off of their feet.
Skier's air bags have become more popular in recent years. They help to keep your body toward the surface of the snow, so you're less likely to get buried., Avalanches happen frequently enough that many organizations provide intensive training courses to coach skiers and snowboarders on how to avoid avalanches, save themselves, and rescue each other. If you're traveling to avalanche country, it's worth taking a course.

"
"
Watch the victim.,
Make sure the danger has passed before entering the avalanche slope.,
Scan the surface of the snow.,
Use avalanche beacons if available.,
Listen for the person.,
Probe the area where the victim is likely to be.,
Mark the victim's location.,
Shovel strategically.,
Dig as quickly as possible.,
Uncover the victim's head first.,
Send someone for help immediately only after the victim's head is uncovered.",How to Rescue an Avalanche Victim," As soon as someone gets caught in an avalanche, try to track their path. Don't take your eyes off them. If the person disappears beneath the snow, note where you last saw them, and continue to watch downhill to see if they resurface.;
, If you're following proper avalanche safety techniques, only one person should be in the danger zone at a time. Make sure the avalanche has completely stopped before others enter the slope.

, Quickly look for any sign of the victim. Sometimes a ski tip or article of clothing will be just above the surface. If the person was carrying an avalanche cord, look for that.

, If the victim is wearing an emergency beacon, you may be able to quickly locate him or her.


Switch emergency beacons into receive mode. All members of the party should switch their beacons to ""receive"" mode to attempt to locate the buried person.






Proceed to the spot where the victim was last seen.






Search for a signal.






Quickly move in the direction in which the signal is strongest. Walk 10–15 feet (3.0–4.6 m) in one direction. If the signal weakens, quickly go the opposite direction. Follow the signal as long as it keeps getting stronger until you can pinpoint the victim's location.







, If the person is conscious, he or she will probably try to cry out. Periodically stop for just a few seconds and silently listen for faint noises beneath the snow. Depending on the depth of burial, keep in mind that you may not be able to hear them.

, If the victim was wearing a beacon, use avalanche probes to probe the area where the signal is strongest. Otherwise begin probing where you last saw the victim and move downhill from there. Probe areas where the greatest amount of snow was deposited first. If several rescuers are available, fan out logically to maximize efficiency.

, Once the victim is found with a probe, leave the probe in the snow as a guide. Note the depth of burial.

, If the victim is buried fairly deep in the snow, you'll need to dig a large hole to get at him. As a rule, the hole will need to be at least as large as the square of the depth of burial (that is, if the victim is buried 5 feet beneath the surface, the hole would need to be 5 feet wide by 5 feet long). Start digging downhill from the probe, and throw the snow downhill.

, If you have multiple rescuers, don't get in each others' way by all digging at once. Instead, maximize digging speed by taking shifts. Whenever one person starts to tire, he should rest and another person should take his place.

, As soon as you can see the victim, try to free his head. Asphyxiation is the primary cause of death in avalanches, so it's essential to get the person breathing as quickly as possible. Begin CPR, if needed, immediately after uncovering the person's head and chest.

, If the victim cannot move on his own, do not attempt to move him unless absolutely necessary. He may have broken bones and internal injuries.

Dress in multiple layers.,
Stick to wool and synthetics.,
Find waterproof outerwear.,
Choose outerwear in bright colors.,
Check weather to see if it is safe to play outside.,
Get a top and bottom base layer.,
Add a shirt or light jacket and pants.,
Top with a quality coat.,
Get good snow pants.,
Get quality socks and boots.,
Cover the head and neck with a hat and scarf.,
Choose warm gloves or mittens.",How to Dress Children Properly for Snow," Dress children in at least three layers before they go out in the snow: a base layer, which wicks moisture away; a middle layer, which insulates warmth; and an outer layer, which offers warmth as well as moisture and wind protection.


The American Pediatrics Association suggests that a good general rule is to dress children in one more layer than an adult would wear in the same conditions.You can adjust these layers based on climate and conditions by adding more than one middle layer, or doing without the middle layer or a removable coat liner.
Encourage kids to come inside to put on an extra layer if they’re cold, or remove a middle layer if they are overheating.;
, When buying base layers and socks in particular, favor synthetic fabrics and natural wool over garments made with cotton. Cotton is a hydrophilic fiber, meaning it absorbs and retains moisture easily, trapping cold moisture against the body and increasing health risks.Good materials to look out for when you’re shopping for warm layers and socks are: acrylic, polyester, wool, Merino wool, and polypropylene.

, Invest in a quality coat and snow pants that are rated for a certain temperature and ability to repel moisture and wind. Choose a rating based on the lowest predicted or average temperatures for the winter in your area.


Know that there is a difference between “waterproof” and “water-resistant,” with the latter being less effective at keeping moisture out of the garment. Check the label and ratings on coats and pants before you buy them.Treat outerwear with spray-on durable water repellant (DWR) to increase effectiveness or re-treat an older garment to maintain its performance.

, Dress children with outerwear in bright colors so that they are visible in contrast to the snow and seen by other pedestrians and nearby drivers through any snowy conditions.


Get coats and snow pants with neon elements or reflective strips for extra visibility. Or add your own reflective tape to a garment., Look at weather reports before allowing your child to play outside in the snow. Avoid sending them out if there is a snow storm, high winds, or other winter weather approaching, or if it is nearing sundown.


If the temperature or wind chill (the “real feel” that takes into account wind) is at or below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, frostbite can occur in 30 minutes or less. Make sure kids go out for only short intervals, or not at all if the temperature and wind chill are very low.Periodically call children inside to check them for signs of frostnip or frostbite, whether or not they complain of being cold. Check the head, face, ears, hands, and feet for loss of color or redness, or reports of numbness or tingling. Run affected areas under warm (not hot) water until sensation returns., Dress children in a base layer for the legs and for the upper body. Base layer garments should fit snugly against the body, be breathable, and dry quickly, so as not to hold cold moisture against the skin.


Buy base layers made from thin wool, polyester, and other synthetic materials. Avoid cotton, as it absorbs moisture easily but is slow to dry, causing remaining moisture around the body to get cold and remain wet.Long Johns or thermal underwear are good choices for a base layer, as long as they are made from a moisture-wicking material and not cotton.

, Over the base layer, dress your child in a warm long sleeve shirt, sweater, or fleece jacket. Pull on light sweatpants or other thin, stretchy, and comfortable pants or leggings. These should fit over your child’s base layer and under coats and pants.


Many people choose to forgo a middle layer for the legs, as legs are more easily kept warm by movement, and bulk accumulates here easily and begins to restrict movement. Use your discretion and listen to your child about their comfort.
Never wear denim jeans or other pants made from very heavy material, as these absorb water easily and dry very slowly.

, Look for winter coat that is intended for snow, cold temperature, wind resistance, and water repellency. Check cold and waterproof ratings to ensure that a coat will meet the conditions of your local climate. Make sure all zippers, snaps, and other fastenings are closed when dressing the child.


Look for coats that are long so they cover the body past the waist, and have high necks and hoods to keep the cold out from the neck and face.
Ideally, a coat should also have plenty of ventilation methods to release sweat from the inner layers. Look for zippers under the arms that allow for ventilation when you need it, a front zipper that’s easy to zip and unzip, and sleeve ends that can be loosened.
Ensure that zipper pulls are easy to handle or modify them so that children don’t have to remove gloves or mittens to zip and unzip., Look for pants that have similar qualities as coats in regards to warmth, good construction, and wind and water resistance. Snow pants are generally thick, insulated pants meant to be worn over other layers.


Consider snow pants in a bib or overalls style that goes over the shoulder to help pants stay on and avoid snow and cold getting in from between the coat and pants.

, Choose quality socks that are 100% wool or a blend of wool and synthetic material. Invest in winter boots that are well made and well insulated, with good tread and a good rating for cold as well as waterproof ability.


Avoid wearing more than one pair of socks, as this will only create bunching and discomfort without much extra warmth.
Ensure that boots are not too tight, especially if wearing them with thick socks. Too-tight socks and boots can constrict blood flow, and thus heat, to the feet and toes., Wrap the neck and even the lower half of the face in a warm knit scarf. Tuck the ends down into the coat and zip it up to or over the scarf. Top the head with a warm beanie or hat with earflaps, then pull up the hood on the coat for extra warmth and protection.


Ensure that the hat you dress your child in fully covers the ears and fits snugly on the head. An ear warmer headband or earmuffs may be needed additionally or instead of a hat if ears remain cold or come uncovered.
Ski masks or balaclavas cover more of the face and can provide extra warmth. Just make sure that your child can breathe and see easily in something covering the face.
Never dress infants or toddlers in a wraparound scarf, and supervise all children to avoid the risk of strangulation. Try a tube scarf or neck gaiter to help reduce this risk.

, Make sure to dress kids in mittens or gloves that are thick, well-insulated, and waterproof. Mittens are ideal, as they hold more warmth inside.


You may want to choose mittens for younger children, and gloves for when children are old enough to have more dexterity in their fingers.Try mittens or gloves that extend up to the forearm, or even shirts that have gloves attached, to avoid getting snow and cold into the gap between coat and gloves.
You can also buy glove liners, which provide an extra layer of warmth and moisture wicking under your regular pair of gloves.

Stay inside your car or tent.,
Keep warm and dry.,
Stay hydrated.,
Determine what to do when the blizzard is over.,
Get medical treatment if necessary.",How to Survive a Winter Storm1," When the snow starts piling up and it becomes clear that you're stuck on the road or your campsite, your best bet is to stay there. Venturing out in the snow increases the mortality rate in this type of situation, since visibility is usually close to zero and the temperature and wind are unpredictable its not worth the risk. Hunker down and plan to wait out the storm.If you're with other people, do not send a person out for help. This is extremely risky and is not likely to end well. It's important to stay together until the storm has passed or you're rescued.
If you're stuck outside without a car or tent, it's imperative that you find some sort of shelter. Seek out a cave or an overhang, or look for a tarp or other materials you can use to fashion a shelter. If all else fails, build a snow cave to serve as insulation.;
, Keep the windows rolled up or the tent flap closed while you're inside. Wrap your coat, blanket, tarp, or any other type of material you have with you around your body to stay warm and to prevent frostbite. If you're with another person, use each other's body heat, too.


If you're out in the wilderness, build a fire close by to keep warm and serve as a signal to attract attention.
If you're in the car, let the engine run with the heat on to stay warm. However, it's very important that you don't keep the engine running if the exhaust pipe clogs with snow; this could lead to carbon monoxide poisoning, which is deadly.

, This is a very important way to keep your body healthy while you're trapped. If you don't have a water supply, stay hydrated by melting snow and drinking it. Put some in a container and melt it using the fire you built or your car's heater.


Do not eat snow. This is harmful to the body. Melt the snow and drink it instead.If you have food, ration it to make it last over several days. Do not eat full meals.

, When the snow stops falling and the sun comes back out, your physical state will help you determine what comes next. You may be able to dig your way out of your car or tent or walk away. If that seems impossible, wait for help to arrive.


If you're on a road, you can be fairly sure help will come soon. People have survived for over a week waiting for help in the car, so sit tight.
If you're in the wilderness and are afraid no one will find you, you may have to hike to safety on your own. Get your bearings and set out in the direction of civilization.

, If you or someone in your group gets hypothermia, remove cold, wet clothes immediately and use hot water bottles and warm fluids to warm up. Read How to Treat Hypothermia for detailed instructions on handling this serious condition.

Know the avalanche types.,
Take an avalanche safety training course and read up on avalanches.,
Recognize nature's warning signs.,
Pay attention to forecasts and heed professional warnings.,
Know how to test the snow for avalanche potential.,
Be prepared.,
Practice avalanche safety while out and about.,
Know what to do in the event of an avalanche.",How to Stay Safe in Avalanche Country," There are several types of avalanches possible, each dependent on the terrain, steepness, and weather:Loose dry-snow avalanches – These can be very large. They start at a single point and can move at 40 mph / 64.3 km/h, and at that speed can easily become airborne.
Airborne powder avalanches – Once airborne at a speed of around 40 mph / 64.3 km/h, these are very destructive and can reach speeds up to 175 mph / 280 km/h.
Slab avalanches – If a slab of snow ceases to be supported, it is easy for it to fall away. Snow accumulates on leeward slopes due to wind and unsettled snow creates soft slabs that are easily triggered by avalanche victims. Hard slabs form on lee slopes where winds are over 30 mph / 48.2 km/h and the slab turns as hard as concrete. The breaking of such a slab can be heard as a huge cracking noise.
Wet avalanches – These are common during spring months or following thaws, as water weakens any layers of snow, including down to the ground level. Wet avalanches can be loose or slab, fast or slow, and set like concrete once they stop making rescue time for victims extremely short. These often occur following heavy rain or a snowstorm that starts cold but ends warm.
Ice avalanches – Ice peels off a crag and falls down the mountainside.
Cornice collapse – Cornices (deposits of wind-drifted snow) can collapse under their own weight, or following a heavy snowfall.;
, Knowledge is your best defense against the danger of avalanches, and there's no better way to gain firsthand knowledge than by taking an avalanche safety course. It is also a very good use of time to read widely on avalanche safety, as there are a number of good books devoted solely to the topic, along with many case studies that make for grim but sobering reading. It has been shown by research that most victims caught by avalanches were either unaware of avalanches or safe route travel skills, or where they did know, they chose to ignore the warning signs.Taking an avalanche safety course won't dent your time much but it could save your life. Such courses vary widely in price and scope, and you can choose courses that fit your primary activities, such as skiing or snowmobiling.


Learn how to measure slopes both with tools and without. Learn how to recognize avalanche slopes. This includes knowing the signs of previous avalanches on vegetation and other natural features.
Learn how to evaluate avalanche hazards. This basically consists of asking: 1. Could the slope produce avalanches?; 2. Could the snow fail?; 3. What will happen to me if the slope avalanches?; and 4. Will conditions get worse. A good course should teach you how to respond to each of these questions and how to to a hazard evaluation summary.Learn how to determine wind direction. This includes noting eroded features, vegetation leans, build-up of snow, snowfall direction, rime deposits (these grow into the wind) and sastrugi.
Learn to ask for local knowledge, especially when you're from out of the area. It can also be helpful to look at internet records pertaining to the ski fields where you're headed, to see what previous seasons have brought by way of avalanches.

, The surest sign of avalanche danger is evidence of recent avalanches, an indication that local conditions are right for more. Keep in mind that 95 percent of avalanches occur during or within 24 hours of heavy rain or snowfall, and high winds also contribute to avalanche formation, so try to avoid heading off-piste in these conditions. Particularly warm days, with thawing or temperatures that approach or surpass freezing, are also high-risk. Another warning is if snow cracks, collapses, or makes a ""whumph"" sound beneath you; that's a sure sign that the snow is stressed and can't bear your weight. Any sudden change in temperature can trigger an avalanche. Even shadows creeping across the face of a slope can change the temperature enough to make snow unstable. If snowballs (rollerballs or sunwheels) are rolling down the slope, this is an indication of temperature increases.


Low temperatures prolong the chances of an avalanche risk.The danger remains for at least 48 hours after snowfall and even longer when it is cold.
Snowfall at a rate of more than 1 inch or 2cm per hour can increase the risk of an avalanche.The highest danger is on slopes between 25 degrees and 45 degrees.Slopes over 25 degrees tend to be sloped a fair-skilled cross country skier would avoid skiing down on skinny skis.Note that the convex section of snow will usually be the fracture zone for an avalanche.If there have been recent avalanches, heed them and do not go anywhere near where these avalanches have occurred, nor near anywhere with similar terrain and temperatures in the same locale. Watch for snow gathering on lee slopes of mountains and hills, and in wind-sheltered gullies.

, In many mountainous areas, these forecasts are regularly updated throughout the avalanche season. You may be able to find this information on the internet, on local radio and TV, at resorts and government offices, or by calling hot lines (Colorado, for example, has 7 hot lines to cover different areas of the state). If an avalanche advisory is in effect, postpone or reroute your trip. If you're near a resort or on frequently used trails, signs warning of avalanche danger may also be present.


Be wary of any individual who presumes to know better than the official warnings. This could simply be a sign of foolhardiness or worse, a sign of over-confidence in their own skills and mountain knowledge. Try to reason with them but certainly don't join them if they insist on doing anything dangerous.

, Before venturing onto a potentially dangerous slope, find a small, safe slope close by on which you can perform stability tests. The test slope should be about the same angle and have the same aspect as the slope you want to cross, but it should be small enough so that the mini-avalanche you may trigger won't be dangerous. If you can determine that the layers of snow are well bonded and strong, the slope is probably safe. There are several tests you can perform, from stomping on the snow to digging a test pit (tests include the Swiss ski-shear test, the loaded column test, and the Rutschblock test). See the ""External Links"" section below for more details on precise tests. In addition, always ask yourself if the weather is contributing to the potential for instability.


Pick a safe trail during avalanche periods of high or extreme avalanche warnings, or stay home. Safe trails are those which do not cross over or underneath any slope steep enough to cause an avalanche.Don't rely on hunches, guesses and gut feelings about safety; evaluate the safety of a slope by your knowledge of avalanche potential. Ignore avalanche warnings at your own peril.

, When traveling into avalanche country, carrying some simple equipment can save your life:


Slope meter: Because avalanches occur almost exclusively on slopes between 25 and 50 degrees, and 90 percent of avalanches occur on slopes of 30-45 degrees, a slope meter is the single most important tool you can have to avoid avalanche danger. Use it to determine the angle of a slope before attempting to cross or climb the slope. If the angle is in the danger range, avoid the slope.
Rescue beacon: Wear a rescue beacon on your top layer of clothing beneath your coat. Switch in on and test it before you set out.
Avalanche cord: Before rescue beacons, the primary avalanche safety equipment was the rescue cord, and these are still useful. Attach one end of the cord (usually about 30 feet long) and drag the cord behind you. If you get buried in an avalanche, at least part of the cord should stay above the surface.
Collapsible avalanche probes. Every member of a group should carry probes to search for buried victims in the event of an avalanche.

Shovels: Everyone should also carry a shovel to dig out people that have been buried.
Avalanche Airbag System: These relatively new devices have been shown to help avalanche victims stay above the surface. You wear the system in backpack and pull a release when the avalanche starts. They're expensive (about $500-1000), but they can save your life.

, There are several key things you can do improve your chances of either avoiding or getting away from an avalanche, as follows:



Study the weather. If you know that the area received freezing rain, for instance, before the last snowfall the odds of an unstable slab are much higher. Learn how to recognize conditions that generate hoar frost and other avalanche promoting conditions (see how to recognize nature's warning signs above).
Travel in a group. If you're alone and get buried or seriously injured in an avalanche, your odds of survival are slim to none – just don't ski alone in avalanche terrain. Always travel with at least one other person, and make sure your companions are trained in avalanche safety and rescue. Try to travel with a group that is evenly matched for pace, simply because your slowest member will slow down all of you, which can be hazardous in avalanche prone terrain. If you have a slow skier in the group, reduce your ambitions for the day instead of leaving that person behind.Pair up when skiing down through trees (this will help prevent problems with tree wells and tree accidents).
When skiing trails that cross the runout zones of avalanche paths during moderate hazard warnings, stick to traveling 50 to 100 meters apart on wide slopes, and cross narrow slopes one at a time just in case an avalanche does occur.Cross slopes at the top or bottom, not in the middle. If an avalanche starts when you're in the middle of a slope, you'll likely have to go too far to reach safety in time. If, however, you're near the bottom or at the very top, you may be able to quickly move out of the way or avoid danger altogether. Stick to ridgelines – but keep off cornices – or travel along valleys that give you a wide berth from the slope in case an avalanche starts above you. If you must go up or down a potentially dangerous slope, stick close to the edge and go straight up or down. Don't criss-cross the slope or travel up the middle.
When resting, rest well away from runout zones of potential avalanche slopes.Tony Daffern in Avalanche Safety warns that while this seems like obvious advice, many a skiing family is tempted to enjoy the view from the position of the large, open snow field which also happens to be the runout zone of an avalanche slope.The same advice goes for pitching your winter camp.
Know when to turn back. Don't push on when the going gets rough. If it's about to get dark, always turn back. And if the snowpack is unstable, turn back. You may need to exercise certain mental fortitude to convince the team to turn back, so prepare your negotiating skills and be ready to explain the signs and reasons for not wishing to press on., While it is hoped you will never need to have to try to escape an avalanche, knowing what to do in the event that you are caught up in one can give you a greater chance of survival. Doing an avalanche course is an important part of knowing how to react in the moments of becoming trapped in an avalanche. Learn both avalanche survival and rescue techniques. None of this is second nature; it must be learned and is not something you want to be learning for the first time in the heat of the moment.



Visualize your escape route. Before you even set foot on a potentially dangerous slope, scope it out to determine where you can go if an avalanche happens. Sometimes there may be isolated areas of safety, such as rock outcroppings or a stand of trees, on the slope. If not, you'll probably need to cross the slope to get to safety. Seek the quickest safe way across avalanche slopes, and have a plan before you attempt to cross them.

Stay indoors as much as possible.,
Have backup heat.,
Stay fed and hydrated.,
Shovel safely.,
Clear the roof.,
Make sure others survived the storm.",How to Survive a Winter Storm2," In blizzard or white-out conditions, visibility can be very limited, even during daylight. Snowdrifts can hide familiar landmarks. Becoming lost and unable to return to shelter is a real possibility.


Keep warm and dry when you do go out. Wear several layers of loose fitting, lightweight, warm clothing rather than one layer of heavy clothing. The outer garments should be tightly woven and water repellent. Most heat escapes the body through the top of the head and the feet, therefore always wear a hat and mittens, which are warmer than gloves.
Be careful to not become soaked by water or sweat – this can cause body related problems. Your skin should stay dry and moderately warm.

, Winter storms can knock out the power, and when this happens the house will quickly grow cold. Aside from having plenty of blankets around, you might want to build a fire in the fireplace to generate more heat, or use a backup generator to keep the power on.Never light a grill or coal stove inside the house. This could lead to carbon monoxide poisoning. Using a generator inside is also extremely dangerous.
Keep the family in one central location, and close the doors leading to the other rooms. This will concentrate the heat in one area, which will be easier than heating the whole house.

, Drink liquids and eat plenty of food to keep your body's energy high and prevent dehydration.

, Many heart attacks and back injuries occur when people used to a sedentary lifestyle attempt to shovel snow. It's extremely heavy work. If you don't work out regularly, see if a neighbor has a snow blower or is willing to help shovel. Take your time shoveling, take frequent rest breaks, and drink plenty of water.

, After a very heavy snowfall, you may need to clear your roof, ideally with a roof rake. Otherwise the weight of the snow may damage your house, especially flat or low-angle roofs. Be sure your air intake for the house is clear, to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning. During a power outage you may not have a functioning alarm.

, When the storm has passed, and you are safe, check on your neighbors, especially the elderly. Check your property for damage and repair anything dangerous. Stay aware of the possibility of a second wave storm.


Help clean up. If the storm has left snow, shovel your sidewalks. Dig out the nearest fire hydrant. Find and dig out your car.

Watch the local news.,
Stock up on supplies.Have enough medication, food, water, fuel, toilet paper, diapers, and so on stocked in your home.,
Turn off the main water supply and open faucets.,
Have a backup heat source.",How to Survive a Winter Storm3," Some storms arrive suddenly, but usually the local weather team can give you some warning that there is a chance of a storm. In addition, during a storm, the radio can give you information on storm intensity, storm tracking and other emergency information.

, Make sure you have enough supplies to last at least a week. Ensure your first-aid kit is well stocked. Have plenty of extra sheets and blankets available.


Get plenty of candles and matches. When the power goes out, you will need to have light to see. Be sure you have extra batteries. Always use caution when using candles.
Purchase self-powered radios and flashlights. Some of these models will also charge your cell phone. Also purchase light sticks as well.
Make sure you have water. Cleaning, then filling the bathtub is a good way to store water. You can quickly pour water directly into the toilet bowl to flush it. If bad comes to worse, you can melt snow to get water.

, This will prevent water from freezing in the pipes and rupturing them, thereby avoiding future expensive damage., Have a fireplace, wood stove, or kerosene heater available to keep you warm. You could also buy a generator for backup electricity. Be sure you know how to use these sources safely, and have appropriate fuel at hand. Be careful to conserve energy if you're anticipating a long power outage.

Mark the outside of the cave.,
Carve in benches and sleeping areas as needed.,
Create ventilation holes.,
Cover the ground with insulating material.,
Move your shovels inside.",How to Build a Snow Cave," Take care not to dig a snow cave under the path of a potential avalanche or rockfall. Slopes with the wind blowing against them could be dangerous if you are staying overnight, as blowing snow could clog the entrance tunnel and block access to the outside air.;
, If you can find a snowdrift at least five feet (1.5m) deep, a lot of your work will be done for you. Look for areas where the wind has blown the snow against a slope. Keep in mind you'll also need an area large enough to house however many people you have. A ten foot (3 m) diameter cave is comfortable for two or three people.

, Light, powdery snow may be difficult to work with, and is more likely to collapse. Fortunately, snow tends to harden once disturbed, so if you have the time to pile it up and wait for it to harden, you will likely still be able to form it into a snow cave., If you are in an emergency situation, one alternative is to dig a trench in the snow and use a tarp to cover it. Prop the tarp up with ski poles or branches stuck in the snow. This is easier and faster to dig, but will not provide the same warmth as a snow cave, and could become buried in a snowstorm.

, Warm, waterproof clothing is essential if you are out in the wilderness. Consider removing one or two dry under-layers of clothing before you begin working so you have something to change into if your clothing gets wet while digging. As for equipment, a compact snow shovel or two will make the snow cave's construction much easier. A non-smoke-producing light source is useful for overnight stays, but a candle or other small flame source can be used if you remember to create a ventilation hole.


Ventilation holes are described further on in this article.

, Having at least two people build a cave together is highly recommended. Keep one person outside of the cave with a spare shovel at all times. This way, if the cave collapses during the digging, the person on the outside can shovel away the snow to rescue the person trapped inside.

, Work in shifts if you have more than one person, and take breaks for eating and drinking. Working slowly but efficiently, without breaking a sweat, will keep you warmer and safer than trying to rush the job. Sweating can cause heat loss, which increases the risk of hypothermia., Unless the snowdrifts in your area are deep enough already, you'll need to shovel the snow into a pile at least five feet (1.5m) tall, and large enough to fit the number of people it will be sheltering.


A quick way to pile up snow is to find a short slope and use your shovel to push the snowdrift down to the base of the slope.Beware of taller slopes with additional snowdrifts higher up, however, as your snow cave could be buried in an avalanche.

, Pack the snow pile or snowdrift by stomping on it with snowshoes or laying a plywood board over it and stomping on that. If the snow is light and powdery, you may wish to pack it down several times as you create the snow pile, in addition to a final pack when the pile is tall enough.

, This makes the snow firmer and will reduce the risk of the cave from collapsing in on you while you dig it out. Waiting at least two hours is recommended, and you may need to wait up to 24 hours if the snow is powdery and dry., If you made a snow pile, dig a tunnel easily wide enough to crawl through and several feet deep, sloping upward. If you are digging into a deep snowdrift, dig a trench 5 or more feet down for you to stand in, then dig a tunnel at the base of the trench.You may find this easier if you have a compact snow shovel, available at backpacking or mountaineering stores.


If you are building a snow cave for fun and don't mind taking extra time, you can avoid some discomfort by digging a ""doorway"" several feet tall instead of a tunnel. Once you've completed the snow cave, wall up most of the doorway with additional snow, leaving a tunnel to exit through., Stick these objects about 12–18 inches (30–46cm) into the snow pile. While digging out the snow cave from the inside, stop when you encounter these objects.Without this guideline, you may accidentally dig the ceiling too thin and expose your snow cave to the elements, or even cause a collapse.

, Shovel snow from the center of the pile or snowdrift out through your tunnel. Once you've hollowed out enough room for your whole body at the end of the tunnel, you can stay there and use your feet to push the snow through the tunnel.Make sure the ceiling of the snow cave remains at least 1 foot (0.3m) thick to minimize the chance of collapse. The sides should be several inches (8 or more cm) thicker than the ceiling.Try to make the floor of the cave higher than the entrance. This will keep the sleeping area warm as the cold air gathers in the entrance tunnel.

, If the temperature is below freezing and you have water to spare, pour water over the outside of the cave. This will freeze into ice and create a sturdier structure.


Never pour water over the cave if the temperature is above freezing.

, Scrape the walls and roof of the cave to make it smooth. Irregular, bumpy surfaces will drip water onto the cave floor, instead of directing water down the walls to gather around the edges.


If dripping is still a problem, carve grooves leading down the walls.

, Use brightly colored gear or conspicuously placed branches to mark the edge of your cave. This may help people find the cave again, and stop them from walking on the roof and causing a collapse.


If you are in an emergency situation awaiting rescue, make sure the gear is visible from the air, not hidden underneath trees or other obstructions.

, The higher the benches/sleeping platforms are, the better, as cold air will sink below the bench keeping you warmer. You may wish to create shelves for easier gear storage, and a trench to make sitting or standing easier.

, Snow caves can become quite insulated from the outside air, especially if moisture from your breath creates an icy layer on the inside wall. To prevent suffocation, use a ski pole or other long object to create an angled hole or two at the slanting edge of the roof. Make sure this hole goes all the way through the roof.


Because ventilation holes will cause some warm air to escape, you may wish to cover the hole with a snowball or other object, then remove it if the air feels stuffy or anyone feels dizzy. Remove the object before you go to sleep.

, Gather pine branches to place on the floor of the cave, to slow the escape of warmth through the ground. Sleep on camping pads, but be aware that inflatable pads may not keep you warm in cold weather.

, While staying in the cave, always make sure you have shovels inside with you so you can dig yourself out in case of collapse or a blocked entrance. Shovel the entrance out regularly during a blizzard.


If too much warm air is escaping through the entrance, block it with a backpack or other easily removed object. Do not wall yourself up.This will also help you hide from animals such as mountain lions and bears.

Pick up basic survival items.,
Keep yourself warm.,
Stay updated.,
Anticipate a long power outage.,
Winterize your home.,
Invest in a carbon monoxide detector.,
Keep your supplies current.",How to Prepare for a Winter Storm," You should have enough supplies to survive without leaving your house for a few days, as well as tools to help you leave if necessary. Stock up on these necessities:



A shovel: Even if you live in an apartment you should own a shovel as you may need to dig yourself out before your ground crew gets in, and they are unlikely to dig out your car.

Flashlights and batteries. Make sure you have good quality flashlights and lamps with fresh batteries. You can also purchase self-powered flashlights and self-powered radios. Some models will also charge your cell phone.
Candles. In case your flashlight suddenly gives out or you run out of batteries, you can light your home the old-fashioned way.
Non-perishable food. Stock up on canned soups and vegetables, powdered food, and grains like rice and pasta. Make sure you have enough to last your family at least three or four days. Make sure you have a manual can-opener, as well.
Bottled water. If you're worried about the pipes freezing, stock up on some water. You can buy it bottled, or simply purchase a few gallon jugs and fill them from the tap.
Blankets and warm clothing. You may already have these items, but remember you will need enough blankets to keep you warm without any heat and in adverse conditions. Consider purchasing mittens, thick woolen socks, and a hooded sweatshirt, if you don't already own these items.
A camping stove or grill. A gas-powered camping stove is a wise investment for any emergency situation. If you have an electric stove in the kitchen a camp stove is almost a necessity. Be sure you use it with proper ventilation to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning, and have plenty of backup fuel.

Matches to light your gas range/camping stove/candles. Do not rely on lighters that can run out of fuel or break down all too easily.
A battery operated radio. This way you can get news without wall power. Make sure the batteries are good. It is also possible to buy a motion charging radio, as you can with a flashlight.
Prescription medications. Like food, it is always wise to have enough to last you a few days.
A first aid kit. You never know what kind of injuries or emergencies will happen, so make sure you have sterile bandages, disinfectant, antibiotic ointment, and over-the-counter painkillers available.
A cellphone with a cord, or a portable cellphone charger. Cordless home phones will not work when the power is out. Many states require at least one wall plugged phone, which receives power from the telephone connection, in all households.
Anything else vital to your household. You should always have ample supplies of items like diapers, formula, pet food, and so on before the storm hits.
Make sure your car is full of gas. You may need to go out before everything is operational.;
, Losing heat is definitely uncomfortable, but you can survive it. Here's what to do:


Stop your pipes from freezing. Before you settle into a nest of blankets, go around your house and turn on every faucet so that it's dripping just slightly. Keeping the water moving through the pipes should help prevent them from freezing.
Seal up any drafts. Put towels at the bottom of any doors that have a gap, or around loose windows. If your windows are single-paned, close the curtains or pin a blanket up over them to keep the heat in.
Dress in layers. Put on a thin layer of cotton clothing close to your skin, and cover as much as your body as you can. (Think old-fashioned long underwear.) For ladies, consider putting on a pair of tights. On top of that, wear as many layers as you need to keep warm, finishing with one (or two) pairs of warm woolen socks and a sweatshirt or coat with a hood.
Wear a hood. You lose a lot of heat from the top of your head, so keep it covered. If you don't have hooded clothing, wrap a scarf or towel around your head.
Stay in bed. Put as many covers as you have left over onto your bed, and hop in. Keeping your body heat in an enclosed space like the sheets will help you stay as warm as possible.
Cuddle up. Join forces with a freezing roommate or family member and huddle under the same blankets — you'll warm up faster.
Conserve energy. Don't run around if you don't have to. Take this opportunity to veg out and relax.

, Having current information is vital in an emergency, so make arrangements to stay informed.


Watch updates on the news or listen to the radio for as long as you can before power goes out.
Use social media for updates. If you don't have access to a battery-operated radio, follow national and local disaster agencies (such as FEMA) on Facebook and Twitter. Check periodically for updates.
Use SMS messaging if land-line service is down. You can send an SMS via basic text messaging, or through Twitter updates. Get the phone numbers or Twitter handles of all your family members, and make sure they know how to reach you.
Keep tabs on your family members. Try to find out where everyone is before the storm and make a plan to stay in a safe location. If you're going to be separated from anyone, set up a pre-determined time and method for touching base again, such as connecting via text message every 12 hours.

, By preparing you can make a power outage bearable.


Keep the fridge closed. This will help it stay cool in spite of the lack of power, and keep your food from spoiling as quickly. Only open it when it's absolutely necessary, grab what you need, and close it up.
Place frozen items outside. Make use of Mother Nature's freezer, and put them in a snowbank outside. If temperatures are below freezing, you could also keep refrigerated items in an enclosed porch.
Plan some entertainment. It can help you stave off boredom while you wait for the power to return.
Play cards. Use a classic deck for games like Blackjack, Poker, War, Go Fish, Crazy Eights or Egyptian Ratscrew.
Read a book (to yourself, or aloud for others). Try to pick an engrossing epic that will keep you engaged and entertained for hours, such as the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Harry Potter novels, or whatever interesting book you happen to be reading.
Get artsy. Draw on pads of paper, or do handcrafts like crocheting or knitting.

, Protecting your house and outbuildings from the cold can save you a lot of money and hassle down the line. Insulate walls and attics, caulk and weather-strip doors and windows, and installing storm windows or cover windows with plastic.


Clear rain gutters and repair roof leaks in order to avoid clogging and flooding.
Cut away tree branches that could fall on a house or other structure during a storm.
If necessary hire a contractor to check the structural strength of the roof. Make sure your roof can sustain the unusually heavy weight of snow - or water.
Insulate pipes with insulation and allow faucets to drip a little during cold weather to avoid freezing.

, If you ever need to run a gas stove inside your home for heat or cooking, you'll definitely want a carbon monoxide detector on-hand. Carbon monoxide is odorless and colorless, but deadly.

, Check the batteries in your flashlights every so often, and make sure you have enough potable water and non-perishable food to last your family at least 48 hours. Once every year or two, replace your current stock of canned goods with a fresh batch.

Look for Polaris, the North Star.,
Use pointer stars to help you find the North Star.",How to Navigate by the Stars1," Polaris is the brightest star in the constellation Ursa Minor, the Little Bear. It can be found in the bear’s tail. (The ancient Greeks, and many other peoples, saw bears as having long tails.) The star is called Polaris because it appears within a degree of the Celestial North Pole and so appears not to move in the night sky. Today, because the seven stars of Ursa Minor look like a small water dipper, most people refer to Ursa Minor as the Little Dipper instead of the Little Bear.;
, Although Polaris is visible in the northern sky at most locations north of the equator, it can be hard to spot if you don’t know exactly what you’re looking for. You can use stars in other constellations to point the way to Polaris.


The most commonly used pointer stars are Merak and Dubhe, the two stars on the edge of the Big Dipper opposite its handle.By following these stars in the direction of the Big Dipper’s mouth, you can find Polaris.
During the times of night when the Big Dipper is below the horizon, such as the early hours of fall, you can instead draw a line through the stars at the eastern edge of the Great Square of Pegasus, Algenib and Alpheratz (actually part of the constellation Andromeda), and through Caph, the star at the rightmost edge of the W-shaped constellation Cassiopeia, to find Polaris."
"
Locate Polaris.,
Determine the angle in degrees between Polaris’ position and the northern horizon.",How to Navigate by the Stars2," Use either of the pointer star methods to help you.

, The most accurate way to do this is with a quadrant or sextant, which lets you read the angle off its curved section. This angle measure is the same as your latitude north of the equator.


If you don’t have a quadrant or sextant, you can approximate the angle by extending your fist to the horizon and stacking fists hand-over-hand until you reach the North Star. Your extended fist is approximately 10 degrees of angle measure."
"
Look for the constellation Orion.,
Find Orion’s sword, if you can.",How to Navigate by the Stars3," The constellation Orion, the Hunter, bears a resemblance to a bent hourglass. The stars Betelgeuse and Bellatrix represent its shoulders; the stars Saiph and Rigel represent its knees (or feet). The three stars in the middle, Alnitak, Alnilam, and Mintaka, represent Orion’s belt.


In the Northern Hemisphere, Orion is visible chiefly in the winter and early spring, but can be seen late at night in the fall or before sunrise in the summer.

, Look for one moderately bright, one dim, and one fuzzy star hanging down from Alnilam, the middle star in Orion’s belt. This represents Orion’s sword, which points to the south.The fuzzy “star” is actually the Great Nebula of Orion, an interstellar nursery where new stars are being formed."
"
Look for Crux, the Southern Cross.,
Extend a line through the long axis of the cross.",How to Navigate by the Stars4," While there is a star near the South Celestial Pole, Sigma Octantis, it’s too dim to do you much good for finding south.Instead, look for the bright constellation Crux, the Southern Cross, which consists of four stars that form the ends of the cross’ upright and crosspiece.The Southern Cross is so prominent a constellation that it is depicted on the flags of Australia and New Zealand.

, The point along this line, about four-and-a-half times the length of the long axis is directly above south.(optionally) Improve your accuracy by finding the two ""pointers"" to the southern cross and drawing a line through them. Then take a line perpendicular from the middle of that and extend it to intersect with the line drawn from the Southern Cross. Where they intersect is directly above south.
Drawing a line through the two stars of the crosspiece will point you to the star Alpha Centauri, the closest star to Earth after the sun.(This star is also depicted on the flag of Australia, but not of New Zealand.)

"
"
Look for the constellation Orion.,
Look for the rightmost star in Orion’s belt.",How to Navigate by the Stars5," As noted before, the torso of the constellation looks something like a bent hourglass.

, This star, Mintaka, rises and sets within a degree of true east or west."
"
Drive 2 stakes in the ground.,
Pick any star you see in the night sky.,
Line the star up with the tops of both stakes.

,
Wait for the star to move out of position with the stakes.",How to Navigate by the Stars6," The stakes should be about 1 yard (91 cm) apart.

, You can use any star for this, although you’ll probably want to pick one of the brighter stars.

,, Earth’s rotation from west to east causes the stars in the sky, as a whole, to rotate from east to west. Which way the star has moved with respect to its original position where you sighted it tells you which direction you’re facing.


If the star rose, you’re facing east.
If the star sank, you’re facing west.
If the star moved to the left, you’re facing north.
If the star moved to the right, you’re facing south."

Gather your tools.This extremely basic sundial is a great way to explain the concept with very little planning.,
Find a sunny area to plant the stick.Look for a place that gets full sun exposure all day long.,
Start at 7:00 a.m.If you want to complete the sundial in a single day, begin in the morning after the sun has fully risen.,
Return to the stick every hour.Set an alarm or keep an eye on your watch so that you can update the dial at the top of every hour.,
Continue this until process until dusk.",How to Make a Sundial1," All you need to create it are a few simple items found in your backyard. These tools are a straight stick (about two feet long), a handful of pebbles and a wristwatch or cell phone to tell the time.;
, Push one end of the stick into the grass or earth. If you live in the Northern Hemisphere, slightly slant the stick toward the North. If you live in the Southern Hemisphere, slight it slightly toward the South.If you don’t have access to a grassy area with soft earth, you can improvise.
Fill a small bucket with sand or gravel and plant the stick directly in the center of it.

, Survey the stick at 7:00 a.m. As the sun shines down on it, the stick will cast a shadow. Use one of your pebbles to mark the place where the shadow falls on the ground.

, Return at 8:00 a.m. and use another pebble to mark where the stick’s shadow falls on the ground. Do the same thing at 9:00 a.m., 10:00 a.m. and so on.


If you want the greatest amount of accuracy, use chalk to mark each pebble with the exact time you placed it on the ground.
The shadow will move in a clockwise direction., Return every hour and mark it with a pebble on the ground. Do this until there is no more sunlight left in the day. Your sundial will be complete at day’s end. As long as the sun is shining, you can use this simple device to tell what time of the day it is.

Gather your tools.This easy sundial is a great project for kids on a summer day.,
Write the number 12 on the very edge of the plate.,
Use a ruler to draw a straight line.,
Use a compass to determine the closest celestial pole.,
Bring the plate outside shortly before noon.Place it on the ground in an area that will get full sun exposure all day.,
Push the straw slightly so.,
Rotate the plate at exactly noon.,
Secure the plate to the ground.,
Return to the plate one hour later.At 1:00 p.m., go back to the plate and check the position of the straw’s shadow.,
Set an alarm and go back outside at the top of every hour.,
Talk to your child about the shadow.,
Repeat this process until dusk.Keep marking the plate every hour until you run out of daylight.,
Check the plate the next day.",How to Make a Sundial2," The tools required are very simple – you probably already have everything you need at home. The items required are crayons/markers, a paper plate, a sharpened pencil, pushpins, a ruler and a straight plastic straw.


Start preparing the plate at around 11:30 a.m on a sunny, cloudless day., Use a crayon or marker for this. Take the sharpened pencil and push it through the center of the paper plate. Remove the pencil so that you’re left with a hole in the center.

, Draw it from the 12 to the hole you made in the center of the plate. This number represents 12 o’clock noon.

, Your straw, or gnomon, should point towards the closest celestial pole, which is parallel with the Earth's axis. That's the North Pole for those living in the Northern Hemisphere. If you live in the Southern Hemisphere, it's the South Pole., Stick the straw through the hole in the center of the plate.

, Do this so that it slants in the direction of the closest celestial pole.

, Rotate it so that the straw’s shadow is aligned with the line you drew. Since you are only measuring the hours of daylight, the plate will end up looking kind of like a clock, showing only 12 hours.

, Poke a few pushpins through the plate so that it will stay fixed in the same place on the ground.

, Write the number 1 at the very edge of the plate, where you see the shadow falling.

, Continue marking the shadow’s position on the edge of the plate. You will observe that the shadow is moving in a clockwise direction., Ask them why they think the shadow is moving. Explain what is happening as the shadow moves around the dial.

, At this point, the sundial will be complete.

, Have your child return to the plate on the next sunny day and tell you the time based on the shadow’s position. This simple device can be used to tell the time on any sunny day.

Cut a 20-inch diameter circle out of ¾-inch plywood.This circle will be the sundial’s face.,
Draw your final design on a large piece of circular paper.You will be using this as a stencil to transfer the design onto the wooden circle, so draw it to scale.,
Use the protractor to measure exactly 15 degrees to the right.Mark the number 1 there.,
Paint your design onto the wooden circle.,
Obtain the gnomon.The gnomon is the part of the sundial that will cast the shadow.,
Prepare the sundial post for mounting.,
Cut the angle into the post.,
Dig a hole for the post.,
Attach the sundial face to the post.,
Rotate the sundial face so that the 6am and 6pm lines are horizontal.,
Set the time and attach the gnomon.",How to Make a Sundial3," Coat both sides of the wooden circle with primer. As the primer dries, think about what you want your sundial to look like. You will need to choose a number style, such as Roman numerals, standard numbers, and so on.


Pick out the colors you want to use and, if you like, a drawing or illustration to put on the face.
Sketch out a few different designs until you’ve settled on something final.

, Now you need to put the numbers onto the design, which will require some precise measuring. Use a straightedge and a protractor to do this.


Start with the number 12 at the very top, like a clock’s face.
Measure where the center of the circle is, then use the straightedge to draw a precise line from the 12 to the center.

, Use the straightedge to draw another hour line. Continue marking the numbers exactly 15 degrees apart. Move in a clockwise direction and use the protractor to continue marking off the numbers. Work your way around until you get to the number 12. This will be directly across from the first 12. These represent noon and midnight.


Then start over with 1 again until you end up back at the original 12 at the very top. The numbers are now accurately marked onto the paper.
The full 24 hours is represented for the most precise accuracy. When seasons change, so does the position of Earth. In summer, days are longer. In winter, they are shorter.
There are days in the summer when there are more than 12 hours of daylight., Use your paper as a stencil so that the numbers and hour lines match what you’ve measured out precisely. Use paint markers to put the numbers onto the wood, since they will involve fine detail work. Paint markers are preferable to permanent markers, since they’re more resilient to the elements.

, It is a length of threaded pipe, and you’ll need it to be approximately two or three inches long. Its diameter should be a half inch. Make sure the diameter of the gnomon is slightly wider than the pipe itself. Improvise a conical tip.


The length of the pipe and the gnomon tip should be no longer than three inches total.
Paint the gnomon in whatever color you’d like. This will keep it from rusting.

, The post is what the sundial’s face, the wooden circle, will be mounted on. You will need a 4x4x8 pressure-formed wooden post that has been outdoor-treated. It needs to be perfectly straight and have no large cracks in it. To mount it correctly, the top of the post must be cut with a precise angle.To get this angle, subtract your current latitude from 90 degrees.
For example, if you are located at 40 degrees N. latitude, you would draw a 50 degree angle on the 4x4.

, Draw a line at right angles using a carpenter’s square. Draw this line six inches from the top of the post. The line is the bottom side of the angle. Use a protractor to measure it, then cut the angle with a table saw.


Then measure the center of the sundial’s face and drill a hole there.Test the attachment of the post to the sundial face with a 5/16-inch lag screw, just to make sure everything fits together properly.

, Find a sunny spot for your sundial and dig a hole for the post. Be sure you aren’t disturbing any buried cables or lines underground. Put the post in the hole. Test to make sure it’s no taller than five feet off the ground when standing erect. Use a compass to make sure the angle you cut into the post is facing north. Use a carpenter’s level to make sure the post is standing exactly vertical.Permanently put the post in place by pouring and setting it in cement.
Allow a few days to go by before mounting the sundial face, so that the cement has dried completely.

, Use a 5/16-inch by 2-inch lag screw to attach the face. Tighten the screw enough so that it holds the face in place, but you are still able to turn the face easily. Place the flange directly over the sundial’s face.You should be able to see the lag screw in the flange’s center hole.
Use your right hand to screw the gnomon pipe into the flange, which you should hold in your left hand.

, Then align the gnomon so that those same lines look like they are going straight through the center. Make sure the line at 12 noon also looks like it is going directly through the gnomon., You must set the time during Daylight Saving Time to read accurately. Hold the flange steady with your left hand. Use your right hand to turn the sundial face. Check the current time. Keep turning the face until the shadow of the gnomon shows the same time on the sundial. Use a pencil to mark where the four flange screws are and then take the flange away.Now tighten the lag screw. Do not move the sundial face as you do this.
Drill holes for the four screws and then screw the flange onto the sundial.
Lastly, screw the gnomon in.

Use the sun.,
Locate a flat, open area.,
Find a stick.,
Check the location of the shadow.,
Draw a line connecting the rocks.",How to Navigate Without a Compass1," If it's in the afternoon the sun will be setting so it will be, more or less, in the west. If it is still morning then it will be rising roughly in the east. You can then figure out the approximate directions of north and south as well.


During midday it can be more difficult to determine which way the sun is moving, so you may need to work a little harder.;
, Find a spot on the ground that is out of the shade. You will need direct sunlight in order to create a shadow.


If you can find a patch of dirt, use that area instead of grass. The grass may make it more difficult to see the shadow accurately and mark it.

, It should be at least three feet tall.Push the stick into the ground so it stands vertically. Place a stone or another stick on the tip of the shadow of the vertical stick. Wait for half an hour.

, After about 20 minutes,check the movement of the shadow. As the sun moves across the sky, the shadow will change in length.Place another rock to mark the location of the tip of the shadow. You may want to repeat this step one more time if you have time to wait. Having more points of reference along your line will help you determine which direction you face more precisely.

, This line points east and west. The first tip of the shadow that was marked is always west, and the last tip that was marked is always east.Draw a perpendicular line through the first line and it will point north and south.


You can also place your left foot on the location of the first marker, and place your right foot on the second marker. The direction your body will be facing is north."
"
Look for the North Star.,
Get two long sticks.,
Find a flat, open area on the ground.,
Push the sticks into the ground a few feet apart.,
Check back after 15 or 20 minutes.",How to Navigate Without a Compass2," At night, in the northern hemisphere, look for Polaris. It is located in the handle of the Little Dipper. Looking at Polaris, you will be facing North. The North Star is always in the same direction in the night sky, so once you can easily find it you will always know which direction is north.At night, you can find the North Star using the Big Dipper as well. The Big Dipper is shaped like a ladle with a handle and a cup. Draw an imaginary line from the two stars that make up the right side, or the outside edge of the cup, of the Big Dipper. Draw it out several hand-lengths from the Big Dipper. The direction from the end of these hand-lengths is roughly true north.
As another way to find the North Star is to learn to identify the five stars that make the ""W"" shape in Cassiopeia. It is located directly above the North Star, on the opposite side of the Big Dipper.In the southern hemisphere, you can find the Southern Cross constellation in the night sky to find south. T

, One should be slightly longer than the other. If you can't locate Polaris, you can line up any star in the sky using the tips of two sticks.You can track the motion of the star across the sky to find out which direction you are facing.

, You will need enough space to stand and place the sticks a couple feet apart. Be sure you pick a spot that has a good view of the night sky.

, Be sure both sticks are standing straight up.


Push the shorter stick in the ground first.
Line up a star in the sky.
Place the taller stick in the ground so the tip lines up in a straight line with the first stick and the star in the sky.

, Look over the tips of the sticks again and note the changed location of the star.


If the star moved left, you are looking north.
If the star shifted to the right, you are facing south.
If the star is higher, you are looking east.
If the star moved down, you are facing west.The star will likely have moved in a combination of directions, like up and to the right. So, you will need to estimate your southeast direction by how much the star moved in each direction.

Hold an analog watch so the face is level with the ground.,
Point the hour hand at the sun.,
Study your watch.",How to Navigate Without a Compass3," You need to have a watch with hour hands, not a digital face to use it. You also need to know your watch is working and set to the correct time.


Note: You should only use this method between 40 and 60 degrees north or south of the equator. The closer you are in proximity to the equator, the less accurate this method will be.If you have a digital watch, you can simply draw a circle on the ground with a stick. You can use this to represent the watch., Turn your body while holding the watch until hour hand is pointing in the direction of the sun.


If you are in the southern hemisphere, point the twelve on your watch in the direction of the sun.
If you are drawing the ""watch"" on the ground, draw a line in the direction of the sun. This will represent the hour hand, or it will represent the twelve in the southern hemisphere. Draw another line to indicate approximately where the other hand on the watch would be according to the current time. In the northern hemisphere, you would draw a line to the 12. In the southern hemisphere, you would draw the second line toward the current hour.

, Find the midway point between the hour hand and the number twelve on your watch.If you are in the northern hemisphere this line points south. If you are in the southern hemisphere, this line points north.

Find landmarks around you.,
Move towards a landmark.,
Find another landmark in front of you.,
Repeat.,
Study the trees.",How to Navigate Without a Compass4," You can look for natural landmarks, like mountains, lakes, and rivers. You can also look for manmade landmarks like roads, buildings or bridges.


You can also try to line up a landmark with another landmark further away. Keep the landmark in line with the more distant landmark as you travel to be sure you are going straight.
If you have a map, orient the map in the direction you are facing. North is usually up at the top of a map.
Walking straight may seem easy, but without a means of getting their bearings people tend to walk in circles while thinking they are traveling in a straight line., When you reach it, make a mark in the direction you came from. Use a stick and scratch a line in the dirt., Look for a hill, a tall tree, or any distinguishing feature in the direction you are heading. Be sure it lines up with your line in the dirt. Continue walking toward the landmark.

, When you get to the new landmark, look back to the last landmark and draw a line in the dirt. Line up a new landmark in front of you from the line in the dirt. Using this technique, you can continue to travel in a fairly straight direction so you can avoid becoming lost.

, Moss will grow only on the north side of a tree. Deciduous plants tend to populate the southern slopes of hills while coniferous trees cover the north. These phenomena occur in the opposite manner in the southern hemisphere. Plant life signs may help you to determine your direction of travel, but it is not very imprecise. Though you shouldn't rely on these occurrences entirely when navigating, it can come in handy when other methods fail.

Decide what to use for your compass needle.,
Choose a needle ""magnetizer."",
Gather additional materials.,
Magnetize the needle.,
Insert the needle or place the needle in/on the cork.,
Float the compass.,
Assess whether the needle is magnetized.,
Figure out which way is north.",How to Make a Compass," A compass needle can be made from any piece of metal that can be magnetized. A sewing needle is a straightforward, practical choice, especially since it's an item you'd normally find in a first aid or survival kit that you might have on hand on a backpacking trip. You could also try these other ""needles"":


A paperclip
A razor blade
A safety pin
A hairpin;
, You can magnetize your needle using a variety of methods: tapping it with a piece of steel or iron, rubbing it with a magnet, or rubbing it on another item that magnetizes it with static electricity.


A refrigerator magnet works well for this purpose. You can also buy plain magnets from craft stores.
You can use a steel or iron nail, horseshoe, crowbar, or other household item if you don't have a magnet.
Silk and fur can also be used to magnetize a needle.
When all else fails, you can use your own hair.

, In addition to a needle and a magnetizer, you'll need a bowl or jar, some water, and a coin-sized cross section of cork.

, Whether you're using a sewing needle or another metal item, rub the item with the magnet. Stroke the needle in the same direction, rather than back and forth, using steady, even strokes. After 50 strokes, the needle will be magnetized.









Use the same method for magnetizing the needle with silk, fur or hair. Stroke the needle with the item 50 times to magnetize it. Don't use these soft items if the needle you're using is a razor blade.
If your magnetizer is a piece of steel or iron, tap the needle to magnetize it. Stick the needle into a piece of wood and rap the top of the needle 50 times.

, If you're using a sewing needle, insert it horizontally into the edge of the coin-sized piece of cork, so that the needle pierces through the cork and comes out the other side. Push the needle through until the same amount of needle protrudes from either side of the cork.









If you're using a razor blade or another type of needle, simply place it on top of the cork so that it's evenly balanced in the middle. You may need a larger piece of cork to hold the razor blade.
Any small item that floats can be used in place of the cork coin. If you're in the wild and in need of something on which to float your needle, you can use a leaf.

, Fill a bowl or jar with a few inches of water and place the compass on the water. The magnetized needle will align itself with the earth's magnetic field to point north to south.









If a breeze hits the compass, it may have trouble aligning itself north to south. Try to shield the compass from wind by using a deeper jar or bowl.
Currents will also disturb the direction of the compass, so you can't expect to get an accurate reading if you suspend it in a lake or pond. You might be able to use a still puddle.

, The needle and cork or leaf on which it is situated should slowly spin either clockwise or counterclockwise to point from north to south. If it doesn't move, rub or tap the needle again to magnetize it.








, Since the magnetized needle points from north to south, you can't use it to figure out where east and west are located until you know which way is north. Use one of the following techniques to get a sense for which direction is north, then mark that side of the compass with a pen or pencil so you can use it to navigate in other directions:









Read the stars. Locate the North Star, the last star in the handle of the Little Dipper constellation. Draw an imaginary line from the North Star to the ground. The direction of the line is due north.
Use the shadow method. Place a stick upright in the ground so you can see its shadow. Mark the spot where the tip of the shadow falls with a rock. Wait fifteen minutes, then mark the shadow's tip with a second rock. The line between the rocks is roughly east to west. If you stand with the first rock on your left and the second rock on your right, you are facing north.

Recognize that ice will never be completely safe.,
Create an emergency safety plan.,
Recognize that determining the safety of ice is dependent on a combination of factors, not on one factor alone.,
Prefer ice that is checked by designated authorities on a regular basis.,
Ask the locals.,
Observe the ice.,
Know your ice color meanings.,
Test the thickness of the ice.,
Understand that ice strength is not the same everywhere, not even on the same body of water.,
Find alternatives if in any doubt.",How to Know When Ice is Safe," Conditions and unseen or unknown factors can render seemingly safe ice suddenly dangerous. Take all care and precautions to avoid mishaps and to put rescue plans into immediate action should something go wrong.;
, Tell people where you are going. If something does go wrong while you are testing or recreating, already have in place the safety procedures that you will carry out for immediate rescue.


For starters, you should be adequately dressed in full cold weather attire. Wear some form of flotation device, even a boating life-jacket, especially if you are testing or snowmobiling. Carry an ice-pick which can assist in giving you grip should you fall in. Never go without a buddy or two. Tell other people where you and your buddy are and what time you expect to return home. This is not an occasion for casual spontaneity.
Have a spare set of warm dry clothes in a waterproof bag handy. That way you can reduce the risk of hypothermia by changing the wet clothes immediately. Other useful supplies to have as part of an emergency kit include an emergency blanket, hand and foot warmers, thick socks, spare tuques, candles and matches. Pack such emergency items for all winter sports outdoors, even for skating outdoors. See ""Things You'll Need"" for further information.

, Ice safety is determined by assessing the following factors together:


Appearance of the ice - its color, texture and features
Thickness of the ice - there are recommended thicknesses for different uses, which are set out below
External temperature over a period of time and on the day
Snow coverage
Depth of water under ice
Size of water body
Chemical composition of water - whether water is fresh or salt
Local climate fluctuations
Extent of ice

, Such authorities may be staff at resorts, clubs or national parks or they may be government officials. At a minimum, such checking should occur daily. Ask them about their procedures if you need to know more to satisfy yourself. In the main, they will have access to quality measurement tools and procedures, along with full training in dealing with ice and ice accidents. This will save you the risk of testing and can reassure you. Nevertheless, continue to take all safety precautions.

, If you're from ""outta town"", don't make any assumptions. Stop at the grocery store, bait shop, local ski store and have a chat, or even drop into a police or fire station and ask questions about the known danger spots and safer spots in the area. People would rather help you out now than have to haul you out later.

, Look at the ice to see if you can see any cracks, breaks, weak spots or abnormal surfaces and to identify the color(s) of the ice. You cannot rely on your eyesight alone. This is just an initial look to help you to decide if it is even worth proceeding to the next step of testing the ice.


If you see any of these signs, you may wish to abandon any further attempt to go on the ice:
Flowing water near or at the edges of the ice
Flowing springs under the ice in spring fed ponds and lakes.
Water flows in and/or out of the iced-over water body
Cracks, breaks or holes
Ice that appears to have thawed and refrozen
Abnormal surfaces that you have not seen before - e.g., pressure ridges caused by currents or winds


Remember this ditty: ""Thick and blue, tried and true; Thin and crispy, way too risky.""

, Although a useful indicator, color alone should not be relied upon. For instance, ice of any color subjected to a running water force underneath will be weaker than ice not subject to that pressure. In general, you can surmise the following from ice colors:


Light gray to dark black - Melting ice, occurs even if air temperature is below 32°F (0°C). Not safe, its weak density can’t hold a load, stay off.
White to Opaque - Water-saturated snow freezes on top of ice forming another thin ice layer. Most times it’s weak due to being porous from air pockets.
Blue to Clear - High density, very strong, safest ice to be on if thick enough, stay off if less than 4 inches (10 cm) thick.
Mottled and slushy or ""rotten"" ice - not so much its color but its texture. This ice is thawing and slushy. It is deceptive - it may seem thick at the top but it is rotting away at the center and base. Most prevalent in spring, may be showing signs of browns from plant tannins, dirt and other natural materials that are resurfacing from thawing. Not suitable for even a footstep.


, If you have already made your observations and you still feel confident, you will need to back this up by checking the thickness of the ice.


Test with at least one other person (the buddy system). Wear a flotation suit or device and use ropes that your buddy can pull on if something goes wrong.
Only go on the ice if the edge of the water body is firm. If it is slushy or cracking, it is unlikely to be safe to proceed as shoreline ice is the weakest.
Chip the ice with an axe or hatchet to create a small hole in the ice, or use an ice auger (a special tool which drills into the ice), for measuring the thickness through. Use a measuring device to determine the thickness.
Learn the thickness safety margins of ice. There are recommended thickness measurements for the safety of ice that you will need to establish to for each activity being undertaken. (N.B. These are recommended, not guaranteed.) Ice begins to be ""safe"" at around 4 - 6 inches thickness. Do not even walk on ice 3"" or less in thickness. However, even at a 9"" - 10"" thickness, there may be unforeseen hazards such as a flowing current underneath that is ceaselessly weakening the underside of the ice. In this instance, even the thickness is not a good indicator of safety, as the ice could collapse at any time.
In general, the rules for ice thickness measurements are:
3"" (7 cm) (new ice) - KEEP OFF

4"" (10 cm) - suitable for ice fishing, cross-country skiing and walking (approx. 200 pounds)
5"" (12 cm) - suitable for a single snowmobile or ATV (approx. 800 pounds)
8"" - 12"" (20 - 30 cm) - suitable for one car, group of people (approx. 1500 - 2000 pounds)
12"" - 15"" (30 - 38 cm) - suitable for a light pickup truck or a van


These are commonly cited measurements.

, The strength of ice is also affected by factors other than color and thickness. Also take into account:


Location of the ice: is it on a pond, a lake, a stream or is there evident flowing water underneath it? Is there a flow into or out of the water body? This will give cause for concern.
Constitution of the water: is it fresh water or saltwater? Sea ice tends to be weaker and needs greater thickness to support the same weight as fresh water. See the External Links below for more information on exact measurements.
External temperature and season: temperature changes constantly. Beware microclimates in the local area. Mid-winter ice is bound to be a lot stronger than spring ice which is subject to rapid thawing and warming bouts of sunshine.
Size and depth of the water body: larger bodies of water take longer to freeze than smaller ones.
Presence of snow on the ice: snow can warm up the ice because it acts as an insulator; ice under snow is generally thinner and weaker than ice without snow.
Weight on ice: what are you putting on the ice? Just you or you and a vehicle? There is a big difference in the weight distribution between a body and a snowmobile with said body on top.

, Skaters can always find a rink or a supervised lake area; snowmobilers and skiers can always stick to trails on land in place of crossing ice; walkers can keep off the ice and continue with their snowshoes along the trail. All out-goers should carry emergency supplies no matter how long they plan to be out nor where they plan to go.

Hold the watch horizontally.,
Point the hour hand in the direction of the sun.,
Bisect the angle between the hour hand and the 12 o'clock mark to find South.,
Hold the watch horizontal.,
Point twelve o'clock in the direction of the sun.,
Bisect the angle between the hour hand and the twelve o'clock mark to find North.,
Use a map to find your hemisphere at home.,
Use the North Star to find your hemisphere in the wilderness.",How to Use an Analog Watch as a Compass," This trick can be used anywhere in the Northern Hemisphere during the day, when the sun is visible. Lay the watch flat and face-up in your palm so that its face is parallel with the ground.;
, Turn the watch, your hand, or your entire body so that the hour hand of your watch is pointing directly at the sun. The time on the watch doesn't matter, as long as it's accurate.


If you're having a hard time lining the hour hand up with the sun exactly, you may want to use a narrow object's shadow to help you. Stick a twig or narrow post into the ground so that the shadow it casts is clearly visible. Then, line the shadow up with the hour hand of your watch. An object's shadow is cast away from the sun, so lining your hour hand up with a narrow shadow is essentially the same as lining it up with the sun itself.

, This is the tricky part. Find the middle point of the angle between your hour hand and the 12 o'clock mark on your watch. Before noon, you'll have to measure clockwise from your hour hand to the 12 o'clock marking, while afternoon, you'll have to measure counterclockwise from your hour hand to the 12 o'clock marking. The middle point between the two marks South, while the point directly across from it marks North.


For example, if it's exactly 5 o'clock in the afternoon and you've lined up your hour hand with the sun, South is the direction exactly between the 2 and 3 o'clock marks and North is the spot across from this point (exactly between 8 and 9).

Note that during Daylight Saving Time, your watch is most likely one hour ""off"" from the ""real"" time. If this is the case, substitute 1 o'clock for 12 o'clock before finding your North-South line.

, As in the Northern Hemisphere, you should take off your watch and lay it flat in your hand when you're in a location where you're able to see the sun.

, The key difference between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres when it comes to using a watch as a compass is that in the Southern Hemisphere, it's the 12 o'clock mark, rather than the hour hand that you must line up with the sun. Reversing the orientation of your watch relative to the sun allows you to account for the difference in the sun's orientation between the two hemispheres.


If you're having a difficult time getting a bead on the sun, you can use the same shadow trick as in the Northern Hemisphere to ensure your 12 o'clock mark is precisely lined up.

, The exact middle of the angle between the 12 o'clock mark and the hour hand on your watch marks North, while the point directly across the face of the watch from it marks South.


For example, if it's 9 o'clock in the morning and we line the 12 o'clock mark on our watch up with the sun, the midpoint between the 10 and 11 o'clock markings is North and the point across from this (between the 4 and 5 o'clock markings) is South.
If your watch is set to Daylight Saving Time, use the 1 o'clock marking on your watch as your benchmark, rather than the 12 o'clock mark, as you would in the Northern Hemisphere.

, The makeshift watch compass described in this article uses the position of the sun in the sky to determine North and South. Because the sun is in a different part of the sky in the Northern Hemisphere (the part of the earth north of the equator) than it is in the Southern Hemisphere (the part of the earth south of the equator), it's important to account for this difference to ensure your compass is accurate. It's usually easy to tell whether you're in the Northern or Southern Hemisphere simply by virtue of knowing what country you're in (for instance, The Southern Hemisphere includes most of South America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Australia). If you're at home (or otherwise near civilization), use a map, a globe, or an online geographical resource to find your position relative to the equator.

, If you're truly lost - for instance, in a life raft in the middle of the ocean, you may not have access to maps, encyclopedias, or the internet. Luckily, if you're deep in the wilderness and you don't know which hemisphere you're in, you can still determine whether you're in the Northern or Southern hemisphere by searching for Polaris, the North Star, in the night sky. This star is visible from the Northern Hemisphere, but if you're even slightly below the equator in the Southern Hemisphere, you won't be able to to see it.


Note that the watch compass described in this article works best in the Autumn and Spring and can be inaccurate near the equator."

Pay close attention to your surroundings and landmarks and relate this to your location on a map.,
Stay calm if you get lost.,
Trust your map and compass (if you have them) and do not walk aimlessly.,
Start retracing your steps.,
Remember that if you are not able to retrace your steps, then the best thing is to just stay put, in one place and let the searchers find you.,
Stay put if it is nightfall, if you are injured, or if you are near exhaustion.,
Remember that as a last resort, follow a drainage or stream downhill or downstream.",How to Find Your Way in Deep Forest,";
, Panic is your greatest enemy. If you run wildly around, even for a little while you could lose your sense of direction complete. Try to remember how you got to your present location.

, Use the compass to give you a sense of direction. Think of which way you came, and if that was Northeast, and then recall if you took a turn and what the direction the turn was. If you are calm, you can remember a great many things. If you are on a trail do not leave it.

, Leave markers where ever you go, so you can return to where you are. Also, if someone tries to find you, they will look for markers. So make as many as you can, on every turn that you make, and try to mark the direction you are taking. You got off the trail, maybe ten minutes ago, so if you track back more than that time, you know you are on the wrong track.

, Create a marking so it can be seen by air. Sing loudly or shout help, when you hear others trying to find you. If you have a whistle, blow it or use a blade of grass. Stay in the open so they can find you easily. Do not hide in a cave or under brushes.

, It is smarter to stay put and try to find your way out in the daylight.

, This can be hard going but will often lead to a trail or road. and you will eventually come to civilization."

, The horizon mirror is only partially silvered, allowing you to look through it and through the sighting scope beyond it.The horizon line forms the baseline for the angle of elevation for the object you’re determining the position of.
Your sextant may not regard the horizon line as being 0 degrees. If it doesn’t, you’ll have to correct the angle measure of the object you’re trying to determine by the same amount as the horizon line error. This error is called index error., A second mirror, the index mirror, is mounted on the moving arm. Moving the arm rotates the disk the index mirror is on until light hitting the index mirror hits the reflective portion of the horizon mirror, making the object the light comes from appear to rest on the horizon.


Sextants designed for looking at the sun include shade glasses to protect your eyes from the sun’s rays.

, The clamp is a flip-lock that prevents the arm from moving freely.

, Make the adjustments gradually while swaying the sextant from side to side until the object just touches the horizon.

, You’ll need to record the time in hours, minutes, and seconds, starting with the seconds first to avoid errors.


Quickly recording the time is especially important if you’re using a sextant in marine navigation.

, You can read the angle of elevation for the object as follows:


The degrees of elevation will be at the center of the index bar (the part of the index arm the clamp and micrometer knob are attached to) in a window over the sextant arc. The index bar may have a small magnifying glass to help you read the graduations on the sextant arc.
The minutes and seconds can be read from the graduations on the micrometer knob.

, The angle measure you found with the sextant needs to be corrected for each of the following things:


Index error. This error is caused when your sextant doesn’t read the horizon as 0 degrees, but as more or less than 0. If your sextant reads the horizon angle as greater than 0 (a positive number), subtract the horizon angle from the angle measure of the object. If your sextant reads the horizon angle as less than 0 (a negative number), add the number of degrees difference to the angle measure of the object.
Dip. This correction adjusts for your position above sea level. Find your elevation in feet (if in meters, multiply by 3.28), then multiply the square root of your elevation by 0.98 to find the amount to correct the angle measure by.
Refraction. Light rays bend when passing through a substance; this bending is called refraction. The thicker the atmosphere, the greater the refraction. You can get the correct refraction correction for where you are by consulting the Nautical Almanac.
Parallax. You need to correct for parallax if you’re observing the sun, moon, or a planet with your sextant. This correction factor is available from the Nautical Almanac.
Semi-diameter. If you’re observing an object with a significant apparent diameter (the sun or moon), you need to find the apparent distance from its edge to its center. This correction factor is available from the Nautical Almanac.When all of these corrections are applied, you have the object’s angle of elevation.

, This occurs at noon, local time (standard time).


Follow the instructions in “Part One: Finding Angle of Elevation for an Observed Object.”

, The sun appears directly overhead (at zenith, 90 degrees elevation) at the equator (0 degrees latitude) on the vernal and autumnal equinoxes (the first days of spring and fall).


From the March equinox, the place where the sun appears directly overhead moves northward until the June solstice, then it moves back toward the equator until the September equinox. The latitude where the sun is directly overhead on the June solstice is the Tropic of Cancer, 23.5 degrees North latitude.
From the September equinox, the place where the sun appears directly overhead moves southward until the December solstice, then it moves back toward the equator until the March equinox. The latitude where the sun is directly overhead on the December solstice is the Tropic of Capricorn, 23.5 degrees South latitude.
If you are north of the Tropic of Cancer, the sun will always appear south of you at its highest point. If you are south of the Tropic of Capricorn, the sun will always appear north of you at its highest point. If you are between the tropics, the sun may appear either to your north or south at its highest point, or directly overhead, given the time of year.

, If the sun appears south of you at an elevation angle of 49 degrees, subtract 49 from 90 to produce a difference of 41.


If you are making this observation on either the June or September equinox, this difference is your latitude, in this case 41 degrees North latitude. If the sun had appeared north of you at this same elevation on either of the equinoxes, your latitude would be 41 degrees South latitude. If it isn’t one of the equinoxes, you have more work to do.
If the latitude at which the sun is directly overhead is north of the equator and the sun appears to your south at its highest point, add this latitude (the solar declination) to the remaining angle to get your latitude. If the sun appeared overhead at a latitude of 20 degrees North latitude when you saw it at an elevation of 49 degrees from your position, your latitude would be 61 degrees North latitude (90 – 49 + 20). Likewise, if the latitude at which the sun is directly overhead is south of the equator and the sun appears to your north at its highest point, you would add the latitude to the remaining angle to get your latitude.If the latitude at which the sun is directly overhead is south of the equator and the sun appears to your south at its highest point, subtract this latitude from the remaining angle to get your latitude. If the sun appeared overhead at a latitude of 20 degrees South latitude when you saw it at an elevation of 49 degrees from your position, your latitude would be 21 degrees North latitude (90 – 49 – 20). Likewise, if the latitude at which the sun is directly overhead is north of the equator and the sun appears to your north at its highest point, you would subtract the latitude from the remaining angle to get your latitude.

, Polaris is the brightest star in the constellation Ursa Minor (the Little Bear, Little Dipper). It is located at the end of the Little Bear’s tail/Little Dipper’s handle. If you have trouble spotting it, there are two ways to find it.


Sight along the two stars at the outer end of the bowl in the Big Dipper in the direction the bowl opens. These pointer stars will lead your eye to Polaris.
Sight from the Great Square in Pegasus through the constellation Cassiopeia (resembling an “M” or “W,” depending on its position in the sky). When the Big Dipper is below the horizon, this is a substitute method to find Polaris.

, See “Part One: Finding Angle of Elevation for an Observed Object” for instructions for how to do this. The angle of elevation for Polaris will be the same as your latitude.


This method works only for locations in the Northern Hemisphere, as Polaris is not visible for locations south of the equator.

If it is cloudy and you can see a vague outline of the sun, you can still do the measurement between the horizon and the sun. There will be a haze around the sun in the clouds: use that haze as the position of the sun. Your calculation may be a bit off, because the haze around the sun is larger than the sun itself, but it will only be by a factor of a few minutes.
If it's cloudy and you can't see the sun at all, you won't be able to use this technique. However, if you have a feeling that the sky may clear up, wait ten or fifteen minutes to see if you can see the sun.;
, If your view is blocked by trees or other items on the landscape, you’ll need to find some higher ground where the view is better. Hike or climb up a bit until the sun is unobstructed in the sky and you can see the space between the sun and the horizon.


If the terrain is very hilly and there's no possibility of climbing higher, walk as much as you can to see if you can locate the sun. If you're able to get a bit of a hint of where it is, you can use the method with the approximate location of the sun.
If trees are blocking your view, make an approximate guess as well. You'll still be able to see a vague outline of the sun, which will be good enough for a measurement.

, Hold up one arm with your wrist bent so your palm is facing towards you. It doesn’t matter which hand you pick, left or right: whichever feels most comfortable. Position your hand with your fingers together and your palm flat. Hold the bottom edge of your hand (the side of your pinky finger) parallel to the ground.You’ll want to take a comfortable stance for this trick, because you’ll have to hold your hands and body still for a while.
Make sure that the ground beneath you is solid: no moving rocks, shale, or uncomfortable footing. This could affect the accuracy of your measurement.

, Hold it so that the bottom edge of your hand is “resting” on the horizon. The bottom edge of your hand will be directly in line with the line between the land and the sky. You’ll want to hold it still and as close to parallel as you can to get the most accurate measurement possible.


No matter your location, the horizon should be a flat line between the sky and the ground.
If you can't get a good view of the horizon due to mountains, trees or other obstructions, you'll have to make an approximate guess. Your measurement won't be perfect, but you'll at least have a general idea how many hours you have.

, If you can still see distance between the top edge of your hand and the sun, you'll need to take a second hand measurement. Holding your first hand still so that you don’t lose its position, place your other hand directly on top of it in the same flat, parallel way as your first hand. Keep your hand still and prepare for another movement.If you do this correctly, the top edge of your first hand, your forefinger, will be lined up with the bottom edge of your second hand, your pinky finger.
Keep your thumb out of the way; only your four fingers should be factored into the measurements.

, If you can still see distance between the top edge of your hand and the sun, you’ll need to measure with your first hand again. Holding your second hand steady without moving it, remove your first hand from below it and place it on top of your second hand. Keep your second hand still so you don’t lose your place.

, As you move your hands, stacking them on top of one another, remember how many hand widths you’ve measured. The count is a measurement of how many hand widths are between the horizon and the sun.


If the number of counts is large or you can't remember, ask a friend if you're in a group. You can stack your hands while the friend keeps count.
If you're alone, you'll have to count carefully by yourself. Speak out loud as you stack your hands, adding each stack vocally instead of in your head. This will help you remember.

, Keep stacking your hands following the same method one until one of your hands reaches the sun. It's fine if the sun is partly obscured by one or more of your fingers. The exact position of your fingers will factor into your calculation of how much time is left before sunset, so be sure to hold your hand in place., If it’s later in the day and the sun is so low that you can’t fit your whole hand between the horizon and the sun, use only your fingers to measure the distance between the horizon and the sun. They’ll still be worth 15 minutes each.

, Look to see how much of the sun is ""touching"" your fingers. Since each finger on your hand is equal to 15 minutes, the difference between one finger and the next will be a significant amount of time left till dark. Leave your thumb out of the calculation.


If the sun appears to be sitting on the top edge of your hand, no additional time should be added.
If the sun is obscured by your forefinger, you'll add 15 minutes to your total count.
If the sun is obscured by your forefinger and middle finger, you'll add 30 minutes.
Keep adding an additional 15 minutes for every additional finger that obscures the sun.

, Each hand is worth an hour, so you'll want to know exactly how many hands you stacked. If you forgot your count at any point in the stack, go ahead and start over.


Add up the number of times you stacked your hands: 1, 3, 5, etc.
If the top of your hand lined up perfectly with the sun, you’re done with your total. The number of hands stacked simply equals the number of hours left until dark. Four hands stacked would equal four hours of sunlight. However, the sun was positioned on one of your fingers, you'll have to do more addition.

, Remember that each hand-width measurement is equal to one hour of time before sunset. Each finger-width measurement is equal to fifteen additional minutes.


For example: if it took you 3 widths of your hands to ""touch"" the sun and the sun was positioned over your forefinger, middle finger and ring finger, the distance between the sun and the horizon would be three hand widths and three finger widths. Three hands widths equals three hours. Three finger widths equals 45 minutes (15 minutes each). Therefore, you would have 3 hours and 45 minutes before sunset."

Collect your tools.,
Plant your stick upright in the ground.,
Wait 15 to 20 minutes.,
Connect the dots.","How to Determine Directions to North, South, East, and West1"," Since the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, the shadows it casts will always move in the same direction, and you can observe their motion to determine directions. For this method, you will need:A straight stick that’s between two and five feet long
A straight stick that’s about one foot long
Two rocks, stones, or other objects (heavy enough that wind won’t blow them around).;
, Place one of the rocks on the ground to mark the tip of the stick’s shadow.

, The shadow will have moved. Take the second rock and mark the new location of the tip of the stick’s shadow.


If you can wait longer, do so, and place more rocks to mark the changing shadow.

, Either draw a straight line on the ground between the two marks or use the other stick to connect the dots and make a straight line. The shadow moves in the opposite direction of the sun, so this line denotes the east–west line: the first dot represents west and the second dot represents east.

If you don't remember the order of directions, start with North and go clockwise, using this mnemonic:Never Eat Soggy Waffles.
Alternatively, picture a clock with North at 12:00, East at 3:00, South at 6:00, and West at 9:00.

Note that this method is only approximate, and can be off by 23 degrees or so."

Connect the dots.","How to Determine Directions to North, South, East, and West2"," This method is similar to the stick method, but it’s more reliable because it uses a longer observation time. Locate flat ground and collect your tools:


A stick or pole that’s two to five feet long
One small sharp stick
Two small rocks
Something like a long string

, This must be done before noon. Wherever the shadow of the pole ends, place a rock.

, Tie the sharp stick to one end of the string, and the other end of the string to the pole, making sure it’s just long enough to reach the rock on the ground.

, With the rock as your starting point, use the sharp stick that's attached to the pole to draw the circle in the ground around the pole.

, When the shadow from the pole finally touches this circle again, mark the point where it connected with the other rock.

, The straight line that connects the first rock with the second rock is the east–west line, where the first rock represents west and the second rock represents east.To find north and south from this point, north will be clockwise from west, and south will be clockwise from east.

Look for the sun at noon.,
Use sunrise and sunset for approximate directions.,
Look at how vegetation is growing.,
Calculate direction with an analogue watch and the sun.","How to Determine Directions to North, South, East, and West3"," At noon, the sun can point you in the general direction of north and south, and consequently east and west, but it will not tell you due north or due south. In the Northern Hemisphere, walking directly toward the sun at noon will lead you south, while walking directly away from the sun will lead you north. In the Southern Hemisphere, the opposite is true: toward the sun will lead you north, and away from the sun will lead you south.

, The sun rises in the general direction of east and sets in the general direction of west every day, so you can use the location of sunrise or sunset to get an approximate idea of direction. Face the sunrise and you are facing east; north will be on your left and south will be on your right. Face the sunset and you are facing west; north will be on your right and south will be on your left.


The location of sunrise and sunset only provide an approximate idea of direction 363 days of the year, because the sun rises due east and sets due west only on the vernal and autumnal equinoxes (the first day of spring and fall)., While using vegetation to determine direction isn’t an exact science or a precise method, oftentimes it can give you a basic idea of which direction’s which. Living north of the equator, the sun is usually in the southern part of the sky, and the opposite is true south of the equator. This means that leaves and foliage will tend to be thicker and denser on the southern side of a tree or bush.The opposite is true in the Southern Hemisphere, where vegetation will be more lush on the northern side.


Many guidebooks will note that moss only grows on the north side of a tree in the Northern Hemisphere, but this is not true. However, while moss can grow on all sides of a tree, it is true that it will often be denser on the side that is shadier (the north in the Northern Hemisphere and the south in the Southern Hemisphere).

, The sun can be used in conjunction with a non-digital wristwatch to provide an approximate idea of the cardinal directions if you find yourself lost in the woods but at least have a wristwatch. In the Northern Hemisphere, point the hour hand on your watch at the sun. South will be halfway between 12 o’clock and the hour hand.In the Southern Hemisphere, align 12 o’clock on the watch with the sun, and the midway point between that and the hour hand will point north.When you are facing north, east is on your right and west is on your left. When you are facing south, east is on your left and west is on your right.
During daylight saving time, use one o’clock instead of 12 o’clock on the watch.For this method to work, your watch must be set for the correct time. It can also have a margin of error of about 35 degrees, so this method is only reliable for an approximate idea of direction."

Recognize Polaris.,
Locate Polaris.,
Draw an imaginary line from Polaris to the ground.","How to Determine Directions to North, South, East, and West4"," Polaris, also called the North Star, can be used in the Northern Hemisphere to help you find north. This is one of the quickest ways to determine your directions at night if you don’t have a compass or GPS.


Polaris, or the North Star, is one of the brightest stars in the night sky. Because it’s located in the sky around the North Pole, it doesn’t move around much, meaning it’s useful and accurate for navigating.

, Find the Big Dipper (also known as the Plough) and the Little Dipper (aka Ursa Minor). Think of the Big Dipper like a ladle (hence the name), where the handle holds a cup, and the outer edge of the cup (the farthest from the handle) points out into the sky and toward Polaris. For confirmation, Polaris is the last star that makes up the handle of the Little Dipper., This is approximately true north. When you face Polaris, you are facing due north; behind you is due south, and due west will be on your left, while due east will be on your right."

Recognize the Southern Cross.,
Use the Southern Cross to find south.,
Choose a guiding landmark.","How to Determine Directions to North, South, East, and West5"," In the Southern Hemisphere, the constellation of the Southern Cross (aka Crux) can be used to guide you in a southerly direction. Five stars make this constellation, and its four brightest form an angled cross.

, Find the two stars that make up the lengthwise portion of the cross and imagine a line that extends out five times greater than the full length of the cross.


When you reach the terminus of that imaginary line, draw another imaginary line that extends to the ground. This is generally the direction of south. , Once you’ve determined the general direction in which south lies, it might be helpful to find a landmark at that location on the ground so that you don’t lose where south lies.

Gather your tools and equipment.,
Rub the needle against the magnet.,
Cut a one-quarter-inch disk of cork.,
Place the cork disk in the center of the bowl of water.,
Wait for the needle to stop spinning.","How to Determine Directions to North, South, East, and West6"," A compass is a round instrument with all the cardinal directions printed on it. A rotating needle uses the Earth’s magnetic field to determine what direction the compass is facing. You can make your own rudimentary compass if you have a few items available. You will need:A metal sewing needle and magnet
A bowl or cup filled with water
Pliers and scissors
A cork (or just a leaf).

, Do this at least 12 times if you are using a weak magnet like a refrigerator magnet, or about five times if you have a stronger magnet. This will magnetize the needle.

, Then, use the pliers to push the needle through the cork disk. (If you don't have a cork, you can place the needle on a leaf.)

, The needle will be free to spin around like a compass needle, and will eventually align itself with the poles.

, If it was properly magnetized, it should tell you the north–south line. Note that unless you have a compass or other reference, you will not know if the needle is pointing north or south, just that it's pointing to one or the other.


Many websites and books say that you can magnetize a metal needle by rubbing it with wool or silk, but that will only create static electricity, not magnetism.

Find your direction with a compass.,
Use a global positioning system.,
Turn your cell phone into a navigation device.","How to Determine Directions to North, South, East, and West7"," Day or night, using a compass, GPS, or cell phone equipped with either is the best and easiest way to determine directions. These devices are also the most accurate, making them the most reliable methods. But, it’s important to note that when your compass points north, for instance, it’s pointing you in the direction of magnetic north, which is different from true north (the same goes for magnetic south versus true south).As you spin around in different directions, the compass needle will spin as well, indicating which direction you are facing.
A compass will give false readings around metal objects like keys, watches, and belt buckles. The same is true for magnetic objects, such as certain rocks or power lines.

, A GPS is arguably the easiest way to determine direction or find your way, because these electronic devices use satellites to position your location. A GPS can be used to tell you where you are, give you directions to a specific location, and track your movements.A GPS must be charged and have a working battery to be functional. It should also be initialized before use, so that it orients itself (knows where it is) and downloads the most current and accurate maps.


Turn on your GPS, and allow it to load and acquire signal.
Not only will the GPS have a compass you can use to determine which way is east, west, north, or south, but on its map it will also have an arrow that points in the direction you are facing.
Your coordinates will appear at the top of the screen, also giving you your longitude and latitude.
Because a GPS navigates using satellites, tall buildings, large trees, and other geographic structures can interfere with its signal.

, Most modern smartphones are equipped with a compass, GPS, or both. There are also applications you can download or software you can install to equip your phone with these features. To use the GPS function on your phone, it must be connected to Wi-Fi or your network, and your GPS or location services must be on.


To access these devices, look for apps called “compass,” “maps,” or “navigation.”

Make note of the position of the sun.,
Estimate the number of hours between sunrise and sunset.,
Divide the sun's path into segments.,
Determine which segment the sun is in.",How to Tell Time Without a Clock1," If you're in the northern hemisphere, face the south; if you're in the southern hemisphere, face north. (If you don't have a compass, use one of these techniques.) In other words, look at the equator--that is the line the sun generally follows in the sky. It always rises in the east (which is to your left if you're facing south, to your right if you're facing north) and sets in the west.


If the sun is in the exact center of the sky, it's exactly noon. A nickname for this is ""high noon"" because the sun is at its highest at noon and the time will be 12:00 PM, but this assumes no daylight saving time, and that you're in the middle of your time zone. For instance, in Salt Lake City, Utah (US), ""high noon"" is actually at 1:30 PM in the summer because there's an hour added by daylight saving and another thirty minutes added because the city is that time distance (west) away from the center of the time zone.If the sun is not in the exact center, you will have to do more figuring. If it is morning, the sun will be in the eastern half of the sky. If it is afternoon, the sun will be in the western half. You can use fractions to divide the sky into hours, and find the approximate time.





;
, This varies depending on the season and location. Winter days are shorter than summer ones: about ten and fourteen hours, respectively. Spring and fall days tend to be about twelve hours long, especially close to the equinox (late March or late September).

, If you're looking towards the equator, you can imagine the sun following an imaginary arc from east to west, beginning and ending at the horizon, even if it's obscured. Visualize dividing that arc into equal segments; the number of segments should equal the number of hours in the day. If you know there are twelve hours in a day, you would divide the arc into twelve equal parts, six on the eastern half and six on the western half.


If you're having trouble visualizing the sky in segments, you can use your hand or fist to ""measure"" segments. Going hand over hand, count the amount of fists from one end of the arc to the zenith (the highest point of the sky). Take that number as half of a day. For instance, if you counted 9 fists, and you know the day is 12 hours long, nine fists would be equal to six hours. To figure out how much time each fist represents, divide the number of hours by the number of fists. One fist, then would equal 6 divided by 9 - or about 2/3 hours (40 minutes). This is your hours-per-fist.


, Starting in the east, count how many segments there are before you get to the segment that the sun is in. That will tell you how many daytime hours have passed. The segments that the sun hasn't touched yet indicate how many daytime hours are remaining. If you know the time of high noon, sunrise, or sunset in your area, then you can approximate the current time.


Using the Salt Lake City example given earlier, let's say there are fourteen segments (because it's summer) and the sun is on the ninth segment (from the east). The eighth segment (right after the highest point) begins at 1:30 PM. The ninth segment begins one hour after that, so if the sun is in the ninth segment, it's probably between 2:30 and 3:30 PM. If the sun was in the sixth segment, the time would be between 11:30 AM and 12:30 PM. With practice, you'll be able to estimate time without consciously dividing the sky.
If you used the fists method, count the number of fists from the eastern end of the arc to the sun. Multiply that number times the hours-per-fist measurement. Let's say you counted three fists from east to west. Three hours times forty minutes equals 120 minutes, or two hours. So it's been two hours since sunrise. If you know the time of sunrise in your area and season, you can approximate what time it is.

Draw a straight line in the ground between the two marks.,
Stand with the first mark (west) on your left, and the other (east) on your right.",How to Find True North Without a Compass1," Alternatively, you can use the shadow of a fixed object. Nearly any object will work, but the taller the object is, the easier it will be to see the movement of its shadow, and the narrower the tip of the object is, the more accurate the reading will be. Make sure the shadow is cast on a level, brush-free spot.;
, Try to make the mark as small as possible so as to pinpoint the shadow's tip, but make sure you can identify the mark later.

, The shadow tip will move mostly from west to east in a curved line.

, It will likely move only a short distance.

, This is an approximate east-west line.

, You are now facing mostly toward true north, regardless of where you are in the world. The illustration shows that the sun and marker at Points 1 is what is happening for Step 2. At Points 2, it shows what is happening for Step 4. This method is based on the fact that the sun moves across the sky from East to West.

Find the moon.,
Imagine the moon is a circle divided into vertical strips.,
Read the moon from right to left, following an imaginary horizontal half-line.,
Observe the moon's position in the sky.",How to Tell Time Without a Clock2," If the moon is full, stop here and follow the instructions for telling time based on sun position. If it's a new moon (i.e. you can't see the moon) this technique will not work.

, The number of vertical strips equals the number of hours in the night, with the first hour at the right edge and the final hour at the left edge. As discussed earlier, the number of nighttime hours can vary by season and location. Let's assume twelve hours, beginning at 6 PM and ending at 6 AM, for now.

, Look for where that line intersects the border between light and dark. Make note of which strip that intersection is in. If as you read from right to left, the moon goes from light to dark, that strip where the intersection is located tells you when the moon will set in the west (Moonset). If the transition is from dark to light, then you can determine when the moon will rise in the east (moonrise).
In this instance, the intersection is at 8 PM, and the transition from right to left is from light to dark. This tells us that the moon will set in the west at 8 PM.






This moon will set at about 7-8 hours after sunset. If sunset is at 7 PM, you can expect Moonset at 2-3 AM.






If the moon is just a tiny sliver on the right, it sets within an hour or two since the night began. If you see it, you're probably within the first hour or two of nighttime, since the moon hasn't set yet.






If the moon is just a tiny sliver on the left, it rises within an hour or two before dawn. If you see the moon in this phase, you can expect the night to be over within one or two hours.







, Divide the moon's path into segments, as described for the sun above. For the purposes of this example, let's assume twelve equal segments for twelve hours in the night.


If you know the moonrise time, estimate how many hours (segments) it already passed since it rose in the east. Add those hours to the moonrise time to get your current time. If you know the moon rose at 9PM, for example, and it's right in the middle of a 12 hour path, that means it's completed 6 hours since it rose at 9 PM. 6 hours after 9 PM is 3 AM.






If you know the Moonset time, estimate how many hours (segments) it has to go before it sets in the west. Let's say you know the moon will set at 2 AM in the west. If the moon is positioned about 2 segments away from the western end of the arc, that means it has two hours before it sets. Two hours before Moonset (2 AM) is 12 AM (midnight).

Locate the Big Dipper constellation.,
Determine the raw time.,
Add one hour for every month after March 7.,
Double the time.

,
Subtract the time from 24.,
Correct for daylight saving time and time zone variation.",How to Tell Time Without a Clock3," You'll only be able to do this in the northern hemisphere and if the skies are clear. In the summer, the Big Dipper will be closer to the horizon.

, The two pointers in the Big Dipper (the two stars furthest away from the handle) are in line with the North Star (Polaris). This line is like a clock hand, with Polaris at the center of the clock; as you look North, 12 is at the top of the clock, and 6 is at the bottom. When you imagine this clock, what time is it? Let's say the ""hand"" falls at 2:30. This is the raw time.

, Likewise, subtract one hour for every month before March 7. If it's May 7, two months after March 7, then you'd add two hours to your raw time, making it 4:30. To be more exact, add or subtract two minutes for every day after or before the 7th, respectively. If it's February 2, it's one month and five days before March 7, so you'd subtract one hour and ten minutes from 2:30 (making it 1:20).


The reason we focus on March 7 is because the star clock always reads 12:00 at midnight on this date, so this is our ""base"" date, and we have to ""adjust the clock"" for any other date.

,, If the time from the previous step is more than 24, then subtract it from 48. We do this because the clock actually goes backwards (counterclockwise) and this subtraction corrects for that. The result will be the real time, given in 24-hour time (military time in the U.S. and Canada). That means that if your result is more than 12, you can convert it to PM.

, If daylight saving time is in effect, add an hour. If you live close to the western edge of your time zone, add a half hour. Likewise, if you live on the eastern edge of your time zone, subtract half an hour. Now you know the time!

, These stars form a line which ""points"" to an imaginary point in the sky which is above the South Pole. Follow the imaginary line down from the two stars five times the distance between them.

Understand the path that the sun takes.,
Find north based on the direction of the sun.",How to Find True North Without a Compass8," Remember that the sun rises in the general east and sets in the general west. In between, the sun will sweep out an arc to the south in the northern hemisphere, and to the north in the southern hemisphere (always towards the equator). This means that in the very early morning (shortly after sunrise), the sun will be generally east, while very late in the evening (shortly before sunset), it will be sun will be generally west.


The path of the sun can vary quite a bit depending on the season, especially far from the equator. For instance, in the summer, sunrise and sunset will tend to be further from the equator (more northerly in the northern hemisphere, and more southerly in the southern hemisphere), while in the winter, they will tend to be closer to the equator. Only one the spring and fall equinoxes does the sun rise due-east and set due-west.
For precautionary measures, familiar with the path of the sun for your area or the area where you will be going before you are in a situation where you have to know it. A helpful and free web tool is available at http://www.sunearthtools.com/dp/tools/pos_sun.php. In particular, try to learn the shape of the path at the two solstices, and the approximate time of sunrise and sunset for these two paths. Knowing this information ahead of time can help you estimate the path for the current day.

, If you determine that the sun is in the east (early in the morning), then north will be roughly a quarter turn counterclockwise (for instance, if you're facing the sun, then you would turn to the left). If the sun is in the west, then north is roughly a quarter turn clockwise. If the sun is in south, then north is directly opposite it.


Around 12 noon (depending on day light savings time and your position within the timezone), the sun will be pointed due south in the northern hemisphere, and due north in the southern hemisphere.

If you are standing exactly at sea level, with the bottom of your feet level with the water, this is the only measurement you'll need.;

,, If you used meters, your answer will be in kilometers, and if feet, the answer will be in miles. The distance calculated is a straight line from your eyes to the horizon.


The actual distance you'll travel to get to the horizon will be longer because of surface curvature and (on land) irregularities. Proceed to the next method below for a more accurate (but complicated) formula.

, It's based on a triangle formed by your observation point (your eyes), the true horizon point (what you're looking at) and the center of the Earth.


By knowing the radius of the Earth and measuring your height of eye and local elevation, that leaves only the distance between your eyes and the horizon as unknown. Since the sides of the triangle that meet at the horizon actually form a right angle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem (good old a2 + b2 = c2) as the basis for this calculation, where:
• a = R (the radius of the Earth)
• b = the distance to the horizon, unknown
• c = h (your height of eye) + R

"
"
Calculate the actual distance you'd have to traverse to get to the horizon by using the following formula.,
Increase R by 20% to compensate for the distorting refraction of light rays and to arrive at a more accurate measurement.,
Understand how this calculation works.",How to Calculate the Distance to the Horizon2,"


d = R * arccos(R/(R + h)), where
• d = distance to horizon
• R = radius of the Earth
• h = height of eye

, The geometric horizon calculated using the method in this article may not be the same as the optical horizon, which is what your eye actually sees. Why is this?


The atmosphere bends (refracts) light that is traveling horizontally. What this usually means is that a ray of light is able to slightly follow the curvature of the earth, so that the optical horizon is a bit further away than the geometric horizon.
Unfortunately the refraction due to the atmosphere is neither constant nor predictable, as it depends on the change of temperature with height. There is therefore no simple way to add a correction to the formula for the geometric horizon, though one may achieve an ""average"" correction by assuming a radius for the earth that is a bit greater than the true radius.

, This will calculate the length of the curved line that follows from your feet to the true horizon (shown in green in this image). Now, the arccos(R/(R+h)) portion refers to the angle that is made at the center of the Earth by the line going from the true horizon to the center and the line going from you to the center. With this angle, we multiply it by R to get the ""arc length,"" which, in this case, is the distance that you are looking for.
"
"
Assume a flat plane or the ocean.,
Solve for the distance in miles by plugging in your height of eye in feet (h) into the formula.,
Derive the formula from the Pythagorean theorem.",How to Calculate the Distance to the Horizon3," This method is a simpler version of the first set of instructions presented in this article, and applies only in feet and miles.

, The formula you will be using is d = 1.2246* SQRT(h)

, (R + h)2 = R2 + d2. Solving for h (making the assumption that R>>h and expressing the radius of the earth in miles, approx. 3959) yields the expression:
d = SQRT(2*R*h)

Have the right materials.,
Find a good location.,
Tie a line between the two trees.,
Hang your tarp over the line.,
Secure the edges of your tarp.",How to Make a Shelter in the Wilderness1," To build a makeshift tent, you’ll need rope or a line of some kind to string between two trees, a tarp or poncho to hang on the rope, and something to anchor the tarp to the ground. If you don’t already have these materials available, you won’t be able to build the makeshift tent.


If you don’t have any rope or string, you can use a strong branch propped between the two trees several feet above the ground. You will need some way to keep the branch firmly attached to your trees, whether it is some string for lashing the branch to the trunk, or a notch in the tree that will support the branch.;
, A makeshift tent will require two sturdy trees located a few feet apart. The trees should be far enough so you can comfortably lay down between them, but not so far apart that you cannot tie your rope between them without running out.

, A clove hitch is a good knot to secure the rope to each tree and prevent slipping. Make sure the rope is taught and low to the ground. You want as little space as possible under the tarp to help keep in warmth.If you are using a stick or branch, make sure you secure it to the tree as low to the ground as possible to trap heat.
If you are in snowy winter weather, you can secure the rope a little higher up the tree to create steeper walls on your tent. The steeper walls will let the snow fall off more easily. Collected snow is heavy, and your tent could collapse if too much accumulates.

, Your support brace (the rope or branch) should be low enough so that that tarp reaches the ground on both sides. Make sure to stretch it tight to keep extra air out of your sleeping space. Spread the edges as wide apart as possible to keep the tarp taught.

, Make sure your tarp is held on to the ground. Heavy objects like large rocks or logs should be enough to hold it in place.If you have additional rope and some stakes (or a few sharpened sticks), you can use these items to secure a tarp with grommets. Run some rope through each grommet to pull the tarp taught, and warp around stakes you have driven into the ground. If you don’t have any rope, you can drive the stakes right through the grommets."
"
Look for a good building site.,
Find sticks to lean against the horizontal brace.,
Pile small debris over the frame.,
Dig a pit for a fire.",How to Make a Shelter in the Wilderness2," A lean-to is a simple outdoor construction, and only requires something for branches or a tarp to “lean” against. Long boulders or fallen trees can be ideal for acting as a horizontal brace to lean other sticks or brush against. Any large, immobile object can work.


If you have a tarp and some rope, you can make a lean-to between two trees., These sticks should be somewhat sturdy, as they will form a side of the shelter. Be sure that there is enough room between them, the brace, and the ground for you to crawl inside comfortably.


You should have just enough space under your brace for you and anyone else with you to crawl into. The more extra space you have there, the harder it will be to keep yourself warm.If you can, keep the lean-to’s profile low to ground. This will help keep you further out of the line of wind, and won’t attract attention. This is helpful if you are trying to avoid detection, or otherwise stay out of sight., You can use leaves, grass, and moss to build a wall on the outside of your lean-to. These will provide further insulation and protection from the elements. Nearly any small forest debris will work. Just make sure to pack it tightly on the wall frame so it won't blow away readily.


You can pile more of this debris on the floor and interior of your lean-to to provide extra insulation., Another way to help keep warm under your lean-to is to build a fire. Dig a small hole for your fire on the open side of your lean-to. Be sure to keep it a safe distance from any underbrush and your shelter.


If you do build a fire, keep an eye on it at all times. If you want to go to sleep, make sure someone will be able to stay up to watch it, or just put it out completely.

"
"
Find a good location.,
Prop a branch against the stump.,
Set up ribbing sticks.,
Fill out the frame.,
Pile debris on the frame.,
Add more branches to the outside.,
Block the entrance.",How to Make a Shelter in the Wilderness3," You’ll need a tree stump, or a tree with a low crook that you can comfortably lodge a branch into. In addition, you’ll need to be in an area with lots of sticks and debris to cover your frame.


Make sure you are away from falling branches or other hazards. Your debris hut will trap heat and keep you warm, but won’t protect well against falling objects., You’ll want a long branch, probably close to 8 feet, that is sturdy enough to support your weight without breaking. The space underneath this branch between where it rests on the tree and sits on the ground should be just large enough for you to fit in.

, Find long sticks to create the frame, or ribbing, of your hut. These sticks should be long enough to lean against the horizontal branch. As you get further away from the tree stump, they will get shorter. These sticks only need to lean against the branch, but if you have rope or twine you can bind them together for a little more stability.


Make sure you leave space between two of the ribs for an entranceway to your hut.The ribbing sticks need to be spread widely enough apart so that you can fit underneath them. Six inches on either side of your body is a good rule to follow. Additionally, they should be steep enough to let water or snow run off., After you have set up this frame, add more sticks perpendicularly on top of this wall frame to create latticework. This will give you something to pile debris on without having it fall on top of you while sleeping.

, This will be any natural material you can find nearby, so leaves, grass, or pine needles. Ideally your debris layer will be 3 feet thick to provide solid insulation. Thicker is always better. Just remember to leave an entranceway for you to get in.After you finish the outer layer, build another insulation layer on the inside walls of your frame. This interior insulation should be about 6 inches thick.
You want your debris to be as dry as possible. If you don’t have enough dry material to cover the whole hut, make sure the driest and softest material is inside your hut, closest to your body.If you are in deep winter, or an Arctic-type environment where there is little debris, you can pile thick snow on the frame instead. The snow needs to stay cold so it doesn't melt, potentially soaking your stuff, or collapsing on top of you., Once you have packed your debris tightly on the frame, lay a few more branches on top of your hut. This will help keep your insulation material from blowing away in strong winds., Once you are snug inside your hut, make sure you close up the entrance to minimize air circulation and trap heat. Additional debris can be harder to gather together behind you, so you may consider something like a shirt stuffed with leaves."

",How to Build an Emergency Winter Shelter," This seemingly short and less important step will actually be the factor that decides between success (survival) and failure (dirt nap). Knowing what you have to work with and how much time to build shelter is the key to surviving cold and snowy weather in the short run. Make use of anything you have and plan to work with whatever is provided by nature.


The amount of manpower you have is limited by injuries, strength, and the general health of you and all other survivors. Even injured persons who can not walk can use their hands to fabricate materials for the shelters so plan to include everyone in the effort.;
, The ability to see is vital. Working in the dark is dangerous and it slows progress greatly, so recognize how much time you have until sundown.

, For a single person shelter you must clear any snow, ice, and debris away to form an area large enough for the survivor to lay down with no more than six inches of space on either side of their body. The space should run so that the short ends line up with the wind direction or to the north and south.

, After clearing this spot of any wet debris it must be padded with materials that are as dry as possible. Pine boughs can be 'slapped' against a tree trunk to knock water, ice, and snow off to dry the materials.


Any man made materials you have access to can be used as well: Floor mats from a car, seat cushions, plastic grocery sacks filled with leaves... Anything that will distance you from the ground and keep you dry. The ground steals heat rapidly and water pools in low spots so this step is critical.







, If possible, locate a long branch or pole that is ideally about a foot taller than the person to be sheltered. This 'spine' will be what sits above the body of the survivor and to which the sidewalls of the shelter will be laid. If you have access to fallen trees that are still attached to their stump you can use the space beneath the fallen trunk as a great start to your shelter.

, Looking at the arrangement from the side will make it appear to be a 30-60-90 degree triangle with the opening at the 60-90 degree angle side. The 90 degree angle is on the ground and it stretches all the way to the the other end of the shelter where the 30 degree angle forms at the closed back end of the shelter. The survivors feet will be down in the space where the spine pole touches the ground and forms that 30 degree angle.

, Lash them together with any cord, rope, wire, tape, or vines you can find. When you grasp the untied ends and pull them away from each other the lashing will tighten and provide a sturdy prop to lay the spine pole on.


These two branches will form a 45 degree triangle to hold the spine up off of the ground. The mouth of the shelter will form a 45 degree triangle with the longest side being the ground the two poles are set on and the point of the triangle above it. The point of the triangle is where the spine branch will rest because the two branches cross and form a small ""X"" to set the spine on.

, Stab smaller branches into the ground and lean them against the spine pole from the front of the shelter down its length towards the 30 degree end of the shelter. They should look like skeletal 'ribs'.

, Any water proofing materials you have will be put to good use in this step but you can still do it without any man made materials.

, Lay them against the 'ribs' with the broken end of the branch pointing up at the spine pole.

, Lay them above the first just like the shingles on the roof of a home. This deflects rain and snow and layers insulation over the frame.

, Crush flat standing weeds and lay them over the branches as well. The goal is to evenly heap water proofing natural materials over the frame not only to keep you dry but to insulate you as well. A plastic tarp, split open plastic trash bags, or rubber floor mats could be draped over the frame and if done properly would keep you dry but would provide little to no insulation.


The idea is to block all light from being seen while in the shelter. Pinpoints of light mean air (and heat) can easily escape from the inside. Covering the shelter with as much insulating material as possible is limited by the strength of your spine pole and of course the amount of available materials.
Even in an open field you can gather bunches of field grasses and make a 'pile' shelter, so covering your 'A' frame should not prove too difficult. Weigh down any materials you cover the frame with to keep them from blowing away in the wind. Mud, branches, and even snow will hold the materials down. Also, snow is a natural insulator.

, This will keep them from blowing away in the wind. Mud, branches, and even snow will hold the materials down. Also, snow is a natural insulator.

, Any materials you have can be stored inside the shelter with you including your drinking water to prevent it from freezing. If built properly this type of shelter can be slept in without heavy clothing and still be adequate enough for survival if not comfortable as well.

, Once the survivor and up to one other guest back into the shelter through the triangle opening at its mouth, they will need to close off the opening. Backpacks, a trash bag full of leaves, or a small frame of sticks tied together and strung with as much materials as possible can be used.


Feel free to 'stuff' the interior of the shelter with dry grasses, leaves, or other materials (rugs, blankets, pillows). The extra padding will help keep you warm as well.

Gather some ash and basswood saplings.,
Prepare the saplings for the frame's poles.,
Prepare cattail leaves for the thatching.,
Prepare the birch bark sheets for the covering.,
Choose the right location.,
Draw a 14-foot (4.2-meter) circle on the ground.,
Use a wooden stake and hammer to make 16 holes around the circle.,
Insert eight of your prepared ash poles into the holes in the ground.,
Lash the poles together to form a dome shape.,
Tie the poles together at the joints.,
Add the remaining poles and lash them together using the same method.,
Mark out a space between two poles for the doorway.,
Add the first horizontal hoop over the frame and fasten it in place.,
Add two more rows of hoops.,
Lash the bundles of cattail thatching to the frame.,
Add a large, woven cattail mat for the doorway.,
Tie the birch bark sheets to the top two hoops of your wigwam.,
Consider adding additional layers of protection.,
Build a hearth or fire pit in the center.,
Consider building benches or sleeping platforms halfway around the wigwam.",How to Make a Wigwam," You will need 16 15-foot (4.5-meter) ash saplings that are about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) thick for the frame. You will also need at least 12 ash or basswood saplings that are 15 feet (4.5 meters) tall and 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) thick for the horizontal hoops.The saplings need to be straight as possible.


Ash and basswood are the most traditional, but you can use other hardwoods, such as: cedar, chestnut, elm, or hickory.If you are making a model, use thin, bendy twigs instead. You can also use wire instead. Florist's wire coated in brown paper would work well.;
, Start by trimming off any bark and branches. This will help reduce wood rot and help the wigwam last longer. Next, cut the ends of the saplings into points. This will make it easier to insert them into the holes.Make your poles extra-strong by hardening the pointy ends in a fire. This will also help them last longer once you drive them into the soil.If the saplings aren't flexible enough, soak them in a lake or river for at least two days first.Be sure to tie them down so that they don't float away.

, Gather 50 bushels of cattail leaves. A bushel is a bundle that is thick enough to wrap your arms around. Separate the cattails into 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) thick bundles. Secure each bundle at one end with some string. Set them out in the sun to dry.If you don't have access to cattails, you can use heavy canvas, which was used to cover wigwams from the late 1700s onwards.You will need 12 to 14 sheets that are 5 by 10 feet (1.5 by 3.5 meters).
If you want to be more traditional, you can sew cattail leaves into large mats. Plan on using 12 to 14 mats, each 5 by 10 feet (1.5 by 3.5 meters).If you are making a model, you could use pieces of grass, raffia, or straw instead. You can also use pieces of cotton, linen, or canvas fabric.

, Gather 7 to 10 sheets of birch bark, about 3 feet (cc meter) square. Use a hot nail or wood burner to make holes along the top edge of each birch bark sheet.You can also use elm bark, or weave mats out of cattails.If you are making a model, you can use white paper instead. For a more realistic effect, go over it lightly in a dry brush dipped in brown paint to make the streaks.

, The ground needs to be flat and level. The soil needs to be soft to dig into, but not so soft that it won't support the poles. It's okay if there is some bedrock, but it needs to be deeper than 12 inches (30.48 centimeters).If there is any scrubby vegetation, you will need to clear it away.
If you are making a model, build this on top of a sheet of Styrofoam or cardboard. You can even paint it brown to make it look like dirt. You can also paint it with glue, then sprinkle real dirt on top.

, Drive a stake into the ground and tie a 7-foot (2.1-meter) long rope to it. Tie a stick to other end of the rope. Pull the rope taut, then use the stick to draw a circle in the ground around the stake, like a compass.Pull the stake out when you are done.

, Each hole needs to be about 8 to 12 inches (20.32 to 30.48 centimeters) deep.Space the holes as evenly as you can, about 9 to 12 inches (22.86 to 30.48 centimeters) apart. If you want to, you can space two of the holes further apart for the entrance.Try to make the holes at a slight, outward angle. This will help create a higher dome once you start building the frame.If you are making a model, use a pen, pencil, or skewer to make the holes.

, Skip one hole between each pole. When you are done, you should have eight holes left.Make sure that you are using the 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) thick poles for this.


If you are making a model, you might want to glue your ""poles"" into the holes. Hot glue would work best.

, Find two poles that are straight across from each other. Bend them together so that they overlap by 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 meters). Lash them together in two places, 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) from the tip of each pole. Continue lashing together opposite poles until you have a dome shape.Do not overlap any poles just yet; you want the poles to be all oriented in the same direction (ie: north-and-south).
If you can to be traditional, use tough bark fibers from a basswood tree.If you want to be less-traditional, or simply don't have access to basswood, you could use heavy jute cording or sisal twine.If you are making a model, you can use baker's twine, jute cord, thread, or even brownish yarn.

, You should have four sets of poles crossed over each other to form a grid. Lash the poles together at each of the four joints, where they connect., Place eight more poles into the remaining eight holes. Lash them together using the same method as you did for the first set. This time, orient the arches perpendicular to the first set, creating a lattice-like pattern. At the end, lash all of the poles together at the joints., Choose a spot between two poles on your frame that is facing east. Mark it somehow so that you will remember where it is.You can do this with a piece of rope, a line of small stones, some leaves, or drawing a line in the dirt.


If you spaced two holes further apart earlier, use that as your entrance.

, Wrap 2 to 3 saplings around your wigwam frame, about 2½ feet (0.76 meters) up from the ground. Overlap the ends of the saplings and tie them together. Lash them to the wigwam frame itself, wherever the poles intersect. Be sure to skip the space between the two poles where you marked your entrance., Use the same technique as you did for the first hoop. As you climb further up the wigwam, you will use fewer saplings. The last hoop should go all the way around the wigwam, including the entrance you marked out.Use the thinnest saplings for the last hoop.
If your wigwam doesn't feel sturdy enough, add a fourth horizontal hoop near the top.

, Secure the cattail thatching directly to the hoops, starting from the bottom-most hoop. Leave a patch empty between the two poles you marked off for the doorway. Also, leave a hole at the top for the smoke to come out of.Try to use one long, continuous piece of string for this.
Give the wigwam a gentle shake when you are done. This will fluff out the thatching and make it water and windproof.If you are making a model, you can hot glue the thatching to the frame instead.

, Weave or sew enough cattail leaves to fit over the gap you left in your wigwam. Secure the mat to the hoop just above your doorway with pieces of rope. If you don't have enough cattail leaves, you can use a blanket or hide instead.


Lash a stick to the bottom of your mat. This will make it easier to roll it up and tie it in place.If you are making a model, you can use a scrap of loosely-woven fabric, such as linen or burlap. You can also use a piece of dried corn husk, or paint a piece of paper to look like a woven mat.

, Start with the lower hoop first, then do the top one. This will create an overlapping, shingle effect. Tie the largest birch bark sheet to the smoke hole at the top of the wigwam. Be sure to tie just one side of it, and leave the other three sides untied. This way, you can open and close it like a flap.Remember to leave a gap on the lower hoop for the doorway.
If you are making a model, you can hot glue the sheets instead.

, This is not absolutely necessary, but it can help make the wigwam warmer and more waterproof. Great options include: blankets, canvas, dried bark, or hides. You only need to place them over the birch bark shingles. Remember to leave spaces for the doorway and smoke hole.If you are making a model, you might want to skip this step. If you really want to do it, try using suede or velvet for the fur, or felt for the blankets.

, Start by digging a 6-inch (15.24-centimeter) deep, 3-foot (0.91-meter) wide well into the center of your wigwam. Line the hole with small stones or clay. Add a ring of stones around the pit to help rein in the fire.If this is a model, you can make the hearth using pebbles or pieces of clay. You don't have to line the hole with anything.

, You don't have to do this, but it can make the wigwam more livable. Cover the benches with dried grass or hides. You can use the benches for seating during the day, and sleeping during the evening. You can also store items under the benches.If this is a model, you could build sleeping platforms using popsicle sticks, twigs, or paper, then carefully slide them into the wigwam through the doorway.

If you cannot find trees in that formation, cut enough stable pole, (e.g., bamboo). or thin logs to make four tripods. Tie them securely. Position them in the mud so that they form a rectangle big enough to hold your body and your equipment.;
, Use string, wire, reeds, vines, or whatever else is available. Make sure that the sticks are evenly positioned and well above the ground or water. (Keep in mind that the water may rise.)

, Lay sturdy sticks across the horizontal sticks, taking care that they are strong enough to hold your weight. If you have enough string, vine, etc., available, tie the sticks in place for added sturdiness.

, If you don't have fabric available, use broad leaves and/or grass instead.

, You will have an easier rest than being on the ground, and be less likely to be bothered by animals and creepy crawlies.

Using a drill, poke four holes in the corners of the rectangle.,
Obtain four metal poles.,
Insert the four poles into the four corners.,
Obtain five sheets of fiberglass.,
Fit the fiberglass.,
Once the six sides have been constructed, poke a small hole in the top face of fiberglass.,
Design the zigalo.",How to Build a Zigalo," Building the foundation of the zigalo is perhaps the most important step in the entire building process. A strong foundation is helpful; a correctly-built foundation is vital.;
,,, Each should have a diameter of approximately one centimeter.

, Each should be between four and six feet in height and no more than one centimeter in diameter.

, If the pole has extra space to move around in the hole, use cement filler to surround the pole, fill in the hole, and restrict all movement of the pole.

, These five sheets will make up the five faces of the tent (not the bottom). These fiberglass sheets should measure the width of the plywood side and the height of the metal poles.

, This step is difficult and may require the assistance of a professional. Next, create a small doorway in one of the sides of the zigalo. Again, your best bet is to leave this to a professional.

, This is very important, as it will allow ample air to enter and exit the zigalo.

, The overall structure of the zigalo is, at this point, complete. Design the zigalo in any way you choose.

Know that there is nearly always a way to build a shelter in the wilderness and that it is not very hard to do.,
If it is night, don't move from where you are.,
Find an area clear of large rocks and roots.,
Find a tree, boulder, rock face, or other large object to be the base for your shelter.,
Begin gathering wood.,
Starting with the larger pieces of wood you have collected, lean them against your object.,
Make your shelter wind and waterproof.,
Be creative.",How to Build a Survival Shelter in a Wooded Area,";
, It is very easy to get lost in the dark, and being separated from the area you do know can be even more frightening.

, Building your shelter in a ditch is a good way to stay out of the wind, but rain might make you wish you had dealt with a light breeze. It is also dangerous if you are in a region prone to flash-flooding. So keep out of ditches.

, It should be tall enough for you to crouch behind, and wide enough to accommodate your resting body.

, It is your most important survival tool. You will use it for your fire, your shelter and hopefully for making some traps for animals. Get anything you can find.

, As you are left with smaller and smaller sticks, start slanting them across the larger ones to avoid gaps. (Bear in mind that some gaps are okay.) Use enough sticks to make sure there are no holes otherwise, it will be hard to cover these with leaves. Do not forget to leave an entrance and an exit.

, There are two ways of doing this. If you are in the snow, pile snow up around it. Of course, if it hasn't begun to snow yet, you can't do that. Instead, cover your shelter with leaves. First, dry leaves. Then, wet muddy leaves if you can get them. This will keep your shelter insulated, and stop it from falling apart. Lay sticks on top of the leaves so that they don't blow away with the first breeze.

, Almost anything you can find has a potential use in building a shelter. A net may be useful for making a hammock (useful in warm weather) and rope has hundreds of uses.

Check what the direction the wind is blowing.,
Look for two large trees.,
Find a large, sturdy branch.,
Gather leaves and smaller branches.,
Tie the backbone in place.,
Line up the smaller branches closely together.,
Place the leaves over the branches.,
Use your lean-to.,
Check your leaves for bugs.,
Carry a tarp when camping.,
Make sure you have adequate bedding.",How to Build a Lean To," You do not want to build a lean-to that's leaning in the direction of wind. Even if the wind is not blowing fast now, it could pick up later and topple your lean-to over.The easiest way to check the wind's direction is to simply try to feel it. Close your eyes and turn your face until you can feel the wind blowing on you.
If you can't feel the wind, look for signs. Check which way flags are blowing or look at the direction water flows.;
, You will need to set up your lean-to between two large trees. These are used to support the large branch that makes up the backbone of the lean-to.You want the trees to be relatively close together. You will need to find a branch long enough to stretch between the two trees.
Make sure the trees are sturdy. You want trees that can support a small amount of weight.

, This branch should be long enough to fit between the two trees you located. You should also make sure it's sturdy. This branch is the backbone of your lean-to. It will support all the other branches that make up the structure.You want a somewhat log-like branch. It should be thicker than the average branch you find in the forest.
You may have to search awhile before you find the right branch. It can be hard to find a branch long and thick enough for your lean-to.

, The smaller branches should be thinner than the backbone branch, but make sure they're long. When your lean-to is in place, the smaller branches will form the side of the lean-to, so they should be able to stretch from the backbone branch to the ground. You will also need bunches of old leaves to insulate the lean-to. Gather some tiny twigs and branches to place over the leaves as well. This will hold them in place.Gather a lot of branches, all in roughly the same length. You can break branches as needed to get them all the same length. The branches will need to be stacked close together to form a solid wall free of holes and cracks.

, You will need rope or twine here. You want to tie one end of the backbone branch to each tree. Make sure you tie the rope tightly. You want the backbone as secure as possible.Place one end of the branch against the tree at about the height of your shoulder. You can use your shoulder to support the branch as you tie.
Wrap your twine around the end of backbone branch. Then, bend the twine in a 90 degree angle. Wrap the twine around the tree.
Bend the twine down 90 degrees again and wrap it around the branch again. Bend it 90 degrees again, and wrap it around the tree again.
You're essentially forming a square with the twine that wraps around the tree and branch. Repeat this process several times until the backbone branch is securely in place. Repeat with the other end of the branch.
When you're done, the backbone branch should be forming a straight line between the two trees.

, You will want to lean the smaller branches against the backbone branch. The branches should form roughly a 45 degree angle with the ground.Continue leaning the smaller branches until a solid wall is formed. Your lean-to should be beginning to resemble a small shelter.
It's vital to lean the branches very close together. Any gaps in the branches could let in cold air. Make sure there are very few gaps or holes between branches.

, Take your leaves and place them over the small branches. You want to have a solid coating of leaves covering the side of the lean-to. The leaves will insulate the shelter and help keep it warm.If possible, wear gloves during this process.
When you finish, lay the smaller twigs and branches over the leaves. This will hold them in place.

, You can now use your lean-to as shelter. You can sleep in your lean-to, as long as you make sure to lay padding down on the ground, use a sleeping bag, and wear many light layers of clothing. However, it's more common to use a lean-to as a temporary shelter to use when it's raining or cold outside.

, You want to avoid bug bites when camping. Before adding your leaves to the shelter, sift through them to check for bugs. If you have a rake, raking through the leaves first may help remove any bugs.Carry insect repellent that contains DEET when camping. This can help prevent mosquito bites.

, While leaves can work on a lean-to, it may be safer to pin a tarp up for insulation. You are less likely to be exposed to bugs this way, and the insulation may be greater. Try to remember to bring a trap each time you go camping., Hypothermia is a real concern when camping, especially if you're using a shelter like a lean-to. If you live in a cold area especially, make sure to bring adequate bedding and clothing.Always bring a plastic ground cloth to lay down under your lean-to.
Wear many layers of lightweight clothing.

Look for natural shelter features.,
Look for two close trees for a lean-to.,
Build a small a-frame or debris hut.",How to Build a Fast Shelter in the Wilderness1," Search in your immediate wilderness area for land features that could act as shelter. These will be the fastest forms of shelter you can make.


Caves or rock outcroppings that hang over your head are simple natural shelters. Build a fire in the entrance to a rock dwelling, to both smoke out any critters living in it and to warm rocks in the fire that you can then put around your body for warmth while sleeping.Look for large fallen trees, which can offer shelter if there is space between the trunk and the ground. Prop branches against either side of the trunk like a tent for more protection. Cover the branches with leaves and brush for more warmth.;
, Build a classic lean-to shelter by first finding two trees that are growing close together, about the height of your own body or slightly longer. Then put a long branch between the trees, or a rope if you have one.


Look for a tree with low “forks” where the trunk or larger boughs branch off from one another. The ideal situation is a tree that forms a “Y” shape with its trunk and branches, where you can simply rest your branch, called a “ridgepole,” into them.
If you cannot find two close trees, you can rest one end of the ridgepole on the ground and the other in or against a tree.
Lay branches at a 45° angle onto the ridgepole on one side. Then cover crosswise with more branches, brush, leaves, snow, etc. until the wall is several inches or even feet thick., Find a tree with a low crook, a sturdy boulder, or a stump to create a small shelter just large enough for your body. Rest one end of a large branch onto the tree, rock, or stump, with the other end on the ground.


Make sure your main branch (ridgepole) is long enough that it will create a space large enough for you to lay down once it is leaned against the tree or rock.
Lay branches at an angle against the ridgepole on both sides. Then cover with smaller branches, leaves, and other brush, laid crosswise on the first branches so they don’t fall through. The thicker the walls the better. Keep a pile of brush outside the entrance that you can use to partially cover the opening once you’re inside.As a fast last-resort shelter, you can also create a debris hut by simply piling debris from the forest floor, then creating a hole in it that’s large enough for your body. Partially cover the entrance once you’re inside to create warmth."
"
Build a tarp tent or lean-to.,
Make a small a-frame with a tarp or blanket.,
Make a tube tent out of trash bags.",How to Build a Fast Shelter in the Wilderness2," Construct the base of a regular lean-to by finding two close trees and resting a long branch in between them, or tying a rope across if you have one. Then drape a tarp over the branch on one or both sides and weight it down on the ground with rocks, logs, dirt, or snow.If you don’t have a standard tarp, you can also construct a shelter with a poncho, garbage bags, a space/emergency blanket, or other plastic sheeting available.
If you have enough tarp material, lay the tarp over the ground inside the shelter for better protection. For an a-frame tent in this way, the tarp would form a full triangle with the ridgepole at its top point.

, Construct a typical a-frame by propping one end of a large branch against a low crook of a tree, rock, or stump to make a shelter just large enough for your body. Then drape plastic sheeting of any kind you have over the ridgepole with equal lengths on either side, and secure to the ground with heavy objects.Small a-frames are suited to one person for maximum warmth, so they also work well if you have a smaller poncho, garbage bags, or space blanket rather than a large tarp.
You can also construct an a-frame with branches and brush for the walls as you would if you didn’t have any other materials, then use a tarp or other plastic sheeting to cover them for extra warmth and protection.

, Build a simple tube tent if you have at least two large trash bags. Split the bottom of one bag, and slide it partly over the open end of the other bag to make one longer tube.


String up the tube between two trees, rocks, or other structures with a long branch or a rope if you have one.
You can also prop the tube open with branches and brush, or simply crawl into it for sufficient protection."
"
Dig a shelter into the snow around a tree.,
Build a snow cave.,
Dig a pit in a desert or beach.",How to Build a Fast Shelter in the Wilderness3," Build a tree-pit snow shelter if you are in a wilderness area with deep snow and evergreen trees, and you have a tool to dig with. Dig around the tree to the ground level to create a shelter where the branches act as a roof.


Look for an evergreen tree that has thick, bushy branches that extend wide from the tree for the best overhead coverage.
Dig down in a circle around the trunk, no wider than the tree’s branches. Dig to a level you can comfortably sit or lay down into, or until you reach the ground.
Pack down the snow at the top and sides of your hole to prevent any caving in. Cut or break off evergreen branches to line the bottom of the hole and provide thicker overhead coverage if needed., Mound up snow and carve out a space big enough for your body to create a small cave that will insulate you from wind and snowstorms. Make a snow pile a few feet longer than your body height and tall enough that you can dig into it without the top collapsing.


After building a mound of snow, let it sit for several hours or pack it down so that it is solidified and will be easier to dig a cave without snow collapsing.
Dig down and into the snow until you have a corridor long and wide enough to fit your whole body inside. Make sure all walls of the cave remain about a foot thick to prevent them from collapsing.
Line the inside with evergreen branches for insulation and comfort. You can also close the entrance with more branches.
For this and any other snow shelter, a shovel is best used for digging, but a cup or bowl, ski or snowshoe, or other sturdy item can be used in a pinch., Access cooler temperatures in the sand and protect yourself from the sun and wind by digging a trench into the sand. Cover the pit with any plastic sheeting you may have, or sand supported by driftwood or branches.


Dig out a trench long enough for your body and as low as you can, running north to south so it gets as little sun as possible throughout the day.
Mound up sand on three sides of the trench to make a deeper pit. Then lay a tarp or other plastic sheeting over the mounds and weigh down with sand, or lay down driftwood, branches, or another flat material to support sand for a roof.
Make sure you build your sand pit well above the water line or high tide mark if you’re on a beach."

When choosing a shelter site in a jungle, always be aware of the following things:


Avoid ant trails and game tracks.,
Cut and lash using whatever resources you have available.",How to Build a Natural Shelter in the Jungle1,"






Avoid sinking soil.






Avoid areas likely to fill quickly with water in the event of a flash flood.






Choose high ground that is located away from swamps and dry river beds.







, Since you'll need to procure raw materials and cut and bind them together, you'll need to use your ingenuity to find materials that take the place of what you'd normally have if you don't already have a pocket knife and rope. Some alternatives include:


Sharpened stick, sharp-edged stones for cutting






Vines, reeds, bandannas, clothing pieces, strong young tree growth, etc. for tying






Leaves, grasses, clumps of mossy material, etc. for bedding, cover, and warmth.

Roll the sleeves up when it gets hot.

,
If you are a girl, put your hair up.,
Wear very light clothing.,

Wear light long-sleeved shirts.,
Try on silk long-sleeved shirts - these clothes can be light and might not make you sweat.,
Don't wear fabrics like polyester.",How to Wear Long Sleeved Shirts in Hot Weather," The jacket is for the cold. That way, when it's cold, you can keep the jacket on when it's cold. Take the jacket off when it starts to get hot.;
, Consider freezing the water bottle a little bit if it will be very hot later.

,, Sometimes, it's actually the hair that's the problem, and what is making you hot.

, Don't wear dark colors as dark colors absorb the heat from the sun making you hotter and much sweatier. Aim for light colors because it reflects the heat from the sun making you less hotter and much cooler!

, Sometimes cotton does the trick, but will make you sweat. It does cool you off at times, but if you can't handle it, you can wear a different material.

, Light colors reflect heat. Dark colors, such as black shirts, absorb heat. This will make you more hot, so consider wearing light colors.

, If you can find thick knitted silk clothes, they will probably work on you. There is also a type of tropical weight wool that you can wear that can also cool you off.

, You will sweat most of the time, especially if it's a dark color and is already a very hot day.

Pick a suitable location.,
Build a basic frame with branches as shown in this image.,
Join the branches to be tied horizontally to the basic frame.,
Do the same now but secure the branches vertically.,
Place green leaves over the structure.",How to Build a Natural Shelter in the Jungle2," Follow similar guidelines when building a shelter as when choosing a suitable site for camping. Look for a location between two small trees, which are spaced around 1.5 meters (5 feet) apart for a single person; make it wider the more people there are.;
, Make the length of the shelter such as to cover you from head to toe; a length of approximately 2 meters (6.5 feet) would be a good length. Lash the branches firmly together, as they'll end up supporting the weight of the entire shelter.

, Natural forks in the branches and branch stumps should be used to support the horizontal branches, as shown in the picture.

, Make sure the branches are well tied down or firmly wedged so that they won't move. You now have a complete frame.

, They should be still connected to their original thin branches or stems. Plants with broad leaves should be chosen as these offer greater shelter protection.


Stack the leaves on stems upwards until they block out the sun. This will likely be about three to four layers.
Tier the leaves by starting from the bottom end. This will create a series of steps with a gradient to allow water to flow downwards and not stagnate.
You may need to tie down the leaves to keep them in place.

Choose a suitable spot and clear the vegetation away from it.,
Find four evenly sized logs, bamboo poles or branches that are shoulder height and about 15cm (6 inches) in width.,
At knee level on the pole, carve a notch for each pole.,
Find the frame materials.,
Make the frame of the shelter.,
Create the side frame.,
Make the floor or sleeping base of the shelter.,
Find the roof materials.,
Put the roof together.,
Cover the roof.",How to Build a Natural Shelter in the Jungle3," This area only needs to be as long and as wide as your own body (plus any other individuals needing to use the shelter.

, Remove branches, twigs, and leaves from these ""poles"".


Dig four holes for the posts using a sharpened stick. The holes should be places at the length and width of the shelter's dimensions.






Pound in the poles until they sit about waist-high to you; this means pushing the poles into the ground about 30cm/1 foot.







, Use a pocket knife or a sharp stick for this purpose. Face each notch outwards and make it about 2.5cm (2"").

, For this, collect six straight sapling trunks or branches of about 10cm (4"") in diameter. They need to be both straight and sturdy as they're going to support your weight.


Lengths: 2 saplings need to be 60cm (2 feet) longer than the shelter's width and the other 4 saplings need to be 60cm (2 feet) longer than the length of the shelter.

, Using one of the two shorter saplings, place it into the notches at the head of the shelter. Do the same for the foot of the shelter. These form the crossbars of the frame. Secure these using rope, reeds, vines, grasses, bandannas, etc. Leave a protruding overlap on each side of the bars of about 30cm (1 foot) for laying the side frame onto.

, Using the longer saplings, place one each side of the shelter, laying over the already lashed-on crossbars.

, Gather about one dozen straight branches 5cm (2"") in diameter and about 60cm (2 feet) longer than the width of the shelter. Arrange them all the way along the side bars of the frame to form a bed base and lash together.

, Look for five straight branches or saplings of 5cm (2"") in diameter.


One branch needs to be 60cm (2 feet) longer than the length of the shelter (it forms the apex).






The other four branches need to be 60cm (2 feet) longer than the width of the shelter (these make the gables).

, As with the base, carve an outward notch about 2.5cm to 5cm (1-2 inches) from the top of the poles. Lay the unused long, thick saplings gathered for the base to form the crossbars. Lash into place.


Add the gable branches. Lash them together at a right angle, then lash the ends of this arrangement to the head posts.






Do this same thing at the foot end of the shelter. Note that if you don't want gables, it might be okay to simply lay the branches and leaves across the the crossbars to create a flat roof. The only problem with this is that if a lot of water pools on the roof, it has nowhere to flow and could collapse on you, wetting you thoroughly.






Lash the apex sapling into the V shape at the top of each gable so that the roof gains a lengthwise crossbar.







, Use branches of about 2.5cm (1"") thickness to place horizontally from one end of the shelter to the other. Lash them into place firmly.


Drape broad leaves over the branches in the fashion of roof shingles.

Gather materials.,
Attach the transversal.,
Test the transversal.,
Attach back beams.,
Interweave branches.,

Make a bed.",How to Build a Lean to Using Two Trees," Pick a pair of trees that are approximately your body length apart. If you can't find any that fit this description, pick a pair that are no closer together than 4 feet (1.2 m) or no further apart than a foot or so longer than your body. There should be enough room behind your trees to lay down with your head at the front of the shelter and your feet at the back (see picture).;
, Figure out how much and what materials you will need. The minimum that you will need is a transversal beam, a long thick and sturdy piece of wood like the one in the previous picture, that will stick out about six inches on the sides of the trees you chose. You will also need at least 5 to 7 back beams. The back beams should be thinner than the transversal but still sturdy and long. You will also need a lot of pine boughs, unless you have a tarp.

, This is where you go out and find the materials you will need in the woods. Be careful not to stray too far from the site and get lost. (You should read How to Survive in the Woods, just in case.) Also remember that in a survival situation, anything is fair game; DO NOT be afraid to cut down trees if you have to. However, if you are just doing this for fun, be kind to the environment and don't cut down trees unnecessarily. Instead, build your Lean to using ""deadfall"" timber, but check to make sure it is still strong and not rotted.


Note: While tools are very useful, if they are not readily available, improvise with things like sharp rocks.
Caution: Knives and hatchets are useful but dangerous if mishandled. Never use dull tools. Don't use tools in a manner they were not intended for. Serious injury or death can occur from misuse of tools.
Danger: if you intend to cut down a tree be aware of what is around it. Extreme injury or death can occur from negligence.

, Using a clove hitch, a method of attaching a string to a piece of wood, and square lashings, method of attaching two logs together, attach the transversal between two trees as shown in the pictures that will follow. The transversal should always be attached at the waist level of the highest person in in a group. While attaching the transversal, use your hip to support it in place while you tie it to the trees.


Note: attach the transversal on the side of the trees you wish to be the front of your shelter.

, This step is very simple. Although the lashings are only made of string or roots, they are still very strong. To test the lashings, sit on the transversal. Be careful, though, because if the lashings are not strong enough, they will fail and the transversal will fall (see picture).

, Attach the back beams as shown in the picture. Make sure that when you lay the back beams on top of the transversal that you have enough room on the inside of the shelter so that you can comfortably lay down inside the shelter and not touch any of the back beams.

, Find some long, flexible, thin branches and weave them through the back beams all the way down to the bottom of the shelter. Space the branches about a foot apart.

, At this point, if you have a tarp, use it to cover the back of the shelter. Tie it to the two trees and secure it on the transversal. Pull it taut from the back of the shelter, covering the entire shelter. Peg or weigh it down so it remains taut. If you do not have a tarp, this is where the pine mentioned previously is used. Weave the pine boughs through the back of the shelter. Make sure that the needles are pointing downwards when you weave the pine so that they will act in a manner similar to the shingles of a roof, causing water to roll down the back of your shelter and not into it. You will have to layer the pine on very thick, about a foot thick. A good way to see if you have enough is to look up through the bottom of the shelter. If you see any sunlight coming through then water can and will get into your shelter. If this is the case put on more pine.

, Sleeping on the ground will cause you to lose body heat drastically through the night. To prevent this, first clear out any leaves or twigs inside the shelter. All that should be left on the ground is dirt.

, To make the shelter more comfortable and, more importantly, to prevent the loss of further body heat, you must now put something between you and the dirt to insulate you from the ground. A thin layer of leaves and twigs is not sufficient. Get some more pine or moss and cover the entire bottom of your shelter with it. A heavy layer of dry leaves or pine needles will also work to insulate you from the ground. You now have a place to sleep out the night.

Keep an eye on the weather before a hailstorm strikes.,
Take shelter indoors.,
Protect yourself if you are driving.,
Ensure that all animals are sheltered and accounted for.",How to Survive a Hailstorm," While it is difficult to accurately predict a hailstorm, they are most commonly associated with severe weather such as tornadoes and thunderstorms. Check your local newspaper or weather channel for the daily forecast, and plan your schedules accordingly in the event of severe weather.;
, Get inside a sturdy house or other building. As soon as you hear thunder and lightning, the threat for hail is possible. Open-sided structures such as bus stops and baseball dugouts are not safe as they are completely exposed to the elements. Being caught outdoors is extremely dangerous during a hailstorm, as you could be struck with or bludgeoned by falling hailstones.

, Motorists should pull off to the side of the road, away from trees or other areas where debris could fall, and stay undercover until the storm has passed. Hailstones, especially large ones, can easily crack or shatter a car windshield. If you can get to a nearby parking garage or other sturdy, covered structure, do so.

, Especially common in rural areas of the country, hailstorms kill hundreds of outdoor pets, cattle, and livestock each year. If you see a storm approaching, herd all animals indoors or into their respective shelters to wait out the storm.

If you have a generator, be sure to have enough fuel to keep it running for a few days. Keep the generator completely outdoors, not in a garage. Running a generator indoors can cause carbon monoxide poisoning and death.;
, Fill up water bottles and jugs when a storm warning is issued. Have a well-stocked cupboard of non-perishable foods that do not require preparation. Keep a first aid kit and a week's supply of necessary medications., Downed power lines and your emergency heat source both raise the risk of fire. Keep a fire extinguisher in your home. Make sure your home's smoke detectors are working., Keep a battery-powered radio in your home, as well as at least one flashlight per person. Make sure to have multiple extra batteries for each. Have enough warm blankets, sleeping bags, and clean clothes for everyone in your household., Cold weather can reduce your battery's power. If you are stuck in your car during a blizzard, it is vital that your battery is strong enough to start your engine in order to keep you warm. Look for any signs of corrosion or wear of your battery's cables, tray, and hold-down brackets. If your car's battery is four years old or older, it may be time to replace it. Make sure to do this early on in the season, not right before a blizzard hits., Make sure your car is well-prepared for cold weather.


Check your tire's treads. If they're worn down, consider replacing them. If winter storms are frequent in your area, you may also want to invest in snow tires. You will need much more grip when driving on ice.Change your oil and replace it with a less viscous oil meant for cold weather. Cold weather will slow oil's ability to flow.Make sure your cooling system is well-prepared. If necessary, flush your system and refill it with a 50/50 mixture of antifreeze and distilled water. Even in freezing temperatures, your engine can overheat enough to suffer significant damage., If you can, keep this kit in your car's backseat rather than your trunk. You want the kit to be as easily accessible as possible in case of emergency. The components of the kit are:

, Other than to clear the exhaust or set flares, you should not leave your car. Your car will provide warmth and protection you will need to survive.


An exception would be if you see a building nearby that you can safely get to. Attempt to seek shelter there instead.The low visibility of a blizzard means that you will be easily lost. Even if you don't go far, there is a good chance you will not be able to find your way back to your car. Do not take that risk.

, Do small exercises, such as clapping your hands or wiggling in your seat. This will help keep your heart rate and circulation at a safe level. When stuck in a confined space like a car, you will be more prone to poor circulation. Poor circulation contributes to frostbite., Start your engine once an hour to help stay warm. Run the heat for no more than 20 minutes at a time.Make sure to keep checking that your exhaust is clean.

, Drink from your bottled water regularly. Eat from your emergency supplies. This will help to prevent hypothermia.


If you run out of water, do not eat snow. The cold will reduce your body temperature. Instead, melt snow using the can and matches from your emergency kit. Only drink once thoroughly melted.

Seek dry shelter as soon as possible.,
Call for help.,
Stay hydrated.,
Do minor, non-strenuous exercises.",How to Survive a Blizzard3," This should be your top priority. Look for nearby buildings and cars. If none are available, look for any structure you can huddle under to protect from the wind and snow. Stay there until the storm passes or help arrives.



Build a snow shelter if you can't find cover and are in an area unlikely to be found by rescuers, such as in the wilderness. If you're in a more populous area, a snow shelter is not advised, as it will make it much harder for rescuers to find you., If you have a cell phone with you, try calling both your city's emergency number and any loved ones who may be able to help. If cell towers are down, turn your phone off to conserve power and try again later. Periodically shout for help in case someone is nearby who can assist you.

, Staying hydrated will help to prevent hypothermia. If you have a water bottle with you, drink from it. However, do not eat snow, as this will drop your body temperature. Find a means of melting it first.

, Clap your hands, wave your arms, kick your legs. This will keep your heart rate up and keep the blood circulating in your extremities. Good circulation will help to prevent frostbite."
"
Change out of wet clothing.,
Gather your family in one well-insulated spot.,
Stay aware.,
Stay inside.",How to Survive a Blizzard4," If you arrive home after being stuck outside, change out of your cold, wet clothes as soon as possible. Frostbite can happen quickly, and it's important to warm yourself up as soon as possible. Wear a full set of warm, comfortable clothing for the duration of the storm.

, The room you pick should be one that contains your heat source and supplies. Try to choose one that has few windows or doors to help keep it insulated. Close off the rest of the house by shutting all windows and both internal and external doors. Cover windows with blankets and stuff towels under the doors., Periodically check the latest weather news for your area. This will help you determine how to stay safe and ration your supplies.


If you have power and cable, watch the weather or local news station. Check online for immediate updates.
If your power or Internet is out, listen to your radio for news. While you may be tempted to use your phone's Internet service, save the battery for emergency calls.

, Unless absolutely necessary, do not leave your home. Remember that there may be downed power lines nearby that you can't see in the low visibility of a blizzard. Only leave to start and maintain the generator, retrieve extra firewood, or if someone in your household has a medical emergency.

Check the weather before you go outside.,
Dress appropriately.,
Scan the scene.,
Take a deep breath.,
Start walking.,
Lean into it.,
Keep your head down.,
Check your belongings.",How to Survive a Wind Tunnel in a Major City," As you are preparing for your day, check the weather. Simply check your weather app, flick on the television or radio, check the newspaper, or use the internet (www.weather.com) to figure out what kind of weather you may encounter. If you live in or commute to a large city with many high rise buildings, check the wind conditions!


If you do not have access to the internet, a radio, a TV or a newspaper, do yourself a favor and ask a friend. There is nothing worse than being caught off guard by windy conditions that you did not expect.;
, Pay attention to the temperature!


Dress for the wind chill rather than the actual temperature.
In any temperatures, wear sunglasses or protective eye wear. No matter what the weather is like, dust, sand, snow, etc. can easily be blown around by the wind. Protective eye wear will save your eyes from debris.
Layers are the key to success. Wearing layers will ensure comfort no matter which way the wind blows. Try thermals for those unbearably cold, windy days!
If you are not willing to wear boots, at least wear long socks or leg warmers! Believe it or not, wind has the ability to sneak in and up through the bottom of your pants.
Hats, gloves, and scarves will be necessary. Hats and gloves are pretty common. Make sure that your hats are snug. Something you may not think of is covering your nose and mouth with a scarf. You won’t be sorry.
When it is warm, remove your hats people; if you have to struggle to walk against the wind, you might as well let it cool you off.
Be sure to wear long pants in extremely windy conditions. You may think it is okay to wear shorts, cut-offs, skirts, or dresses when it is warm out, but there IS such a thing as windburn.

, Make sure that nothing potentially dangerous is in the way of your path. If you are about to walk between two tall buildings, you are taking the risk of entering a wind tunnel.


This may seem like common sense to you, but if you are new to life in large windy cities, you must expect the unexpected in order to avoid being unprepared!

, Seriously, do your breathing now because it’s hard to catch your breath once you’re walking against the wind.

, The faster you move, the faster it will be over. Any hesitation while walking will only increase the amount of time that you must face being knocked around by the wind.

, Leaning into the wind can help alleviate some of the resistance. If you try to stand up straight instead, you run the risk of landing flat on your back.

, In case foreign objects (i.e. sand, dust, bugs) come flying your way; you’ll want to make sure your face is protected. Also, if you do not have some sort of covering for your mouth as suggested earlier on, keep your mouth closed.

, Once you've made it through, make sure that all of your belongings are still in your possession.

Try to move on.",How to Survive a Tornado (for Kids)," You will probably be more scared of tornadoes if you don't know anything about them; a good way to mentally prepare for a tornado is to learn about them. Ask a parent or trusted adult to take you to a library or let you read kid-friendly online articles about tornadoes to get a better picture of what they are and how severe they can be. That way if one comes, you may not be as frightened. ;
, Ask your parents to help you gather the following things to put in the kit. It may be a good idea to make a second survival kit for your car.


A first aid kit
A battery-operated radio
Enough flashlights for everyone in your family
Extra batteries
Enough non-perishable (canned) food items to feed your family for at least 3 days
A can opener
Enough bottled water for 3 days
Protective clothing for everyone
Written instructions on how to turn off the gas, water, and electricity

, Ask your whole family to sit down together and talk about what you should do and where you should go in case of a tornado. Make sure to cover everything you can think of, including what you should do if you're outside in the yard or even in the car. Remember to include your pets! You should choose a sturdy, interior room on the lowest floor of your home (preferably the basement if you have one), away from windows (such as a bathroom or closet) to gather in during a tornado. Your shelter room should have your survival kit stored in it for easy access.

, This could include:


What it means when the siren sounds (some areas sound it for severe thunderstorms too)
What county or parish you live in
Your home address
Other tornado safe homes or businesses in the area
Your parent's contact information

, The sirens will not sound for a tornado watch in most areas, but you still need to keep an eye on the weather in case you are put into a tornado warning. Turn on the local news or listen to a radio so that you stay up-to-date on the storm. It is not recommended to go to sleep or leave your home just in case a tornado does hit.

, If you hear the sirens, immediately awaken your family if they are asleep and head to your safe room or shelter. Warnings are issued when a tornado is in your area and is almost guaranteed to hit. Especially if the storm is already upon you, get yourself and your family to the basement quickly and safely. Don't forget your pets!


If you have a few extra minutes, consider grabbing bike helmets. It may sound silly, but wearing a helmet during the tornado will protect your head from flying debris and broken glass, and possibly even save your life. For toddlers and babies, strapping them into a car seat will protect and stabilize them during a tornado just like it would in a car accident.
For even more protection from the tornado, sit underneath a heavy piece of furniture such as a table, or lay in the bathtub with blankets over the top of you. Pretty much anything between you and the tornado will help keep you at least a little bit more protected.

, Nothing is worth going back for once the tornado hits, unless it is another person (in which case an adult should go back). You shouldn't go back for a stuffed animal, picture album, or even your pets. None of those things are worth risking your life for. Unless your pets are caged up they will be smart enough to take shelter during the tornado, so don't be too surprised if they join you in your safe room at some point.

, Even after you think the tornado is gone or it has been announced on the radio, remain in your shelter for at least 20 minutes or until any remaining lightning or thunder has passed. It can be just as dangerous as the tornado itself, and could be a sign that more bad weather is on the way.

, However, if your shelter has been severely damaged or you or someone else is injured, it may be better to get out and seek help. Emergency services will be on the scene of the storm almost immediately after it has passed.

, This is where your survival kit comes in handy.


Give everyone a flashlight. This will not only help you to see, but to keep yourself safe from other potential dangers after the storm and signal rescuers and emergency services for help. Make sure to keep the extra batteries nearby in case your flashlight dies.
Check for anyone who is injured or trapped without putting yourself or others in danger. Use your first aid kit and help as much as you can while you wait for the emergency services to arrive.
Have an adult inspect your home for hazards if possible. Broken glass, downed power lines or trees, and other debris are things you should watch out for. Reduce the risk of further danger by turning off the electricity, gas, and water if you can do it safely.

,


Disaster relief stations will most likely be set up by churches or organizations such as the Red Cross within a few hours after the storm. They will have a place for you and your family to sleep, eat, and get medical treatment or assistance. Try to make your way to one or find somebody such as a rescuer to help you get there. Only wait for someone to rescue you if you are physically unable or are trapped in your shelter; the relief workers will have enough to do already. Mark your home with a flag or note of some sort if you can to alert them you have already gotten out safely.
If you are trapped or physically unable to get out by yourself, try to signal for help. There will most likely be a lot of talking, shouting, and other noises going on in the aftermath of the tornado, so separate yourself from the rescuers by signalling in groups of three. Three shouts, three whistles, three claps, three flashes of your flashlight, etc. as that is the global distress signal.

, Once it has been deemed safe for you to go back to your home, try to find anything that survived the tornado. You likely had lots of items that were special to you and your family such as photographs, toys, books, or clothes. Maybe some of these things were left unharmed! Try not to get your hopes up too high, though; you may not find much of anything that is still worth keeping.

, Tornadoes can be scary and devastating, but you need to keep your head held high. You can help clean up the debris and repair or rebuild your home or other buildings. Plus, just think of all the new toys and clothes you'll get, or how much closer your neighborhood will become in overcoming the disaster. Not everything is a total bust.
