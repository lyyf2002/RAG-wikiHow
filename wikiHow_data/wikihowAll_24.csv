Elevate swollen limbs.,
Massage the swollen limbs.,
Stretch throughout the day.",How to Prevent Swelling in Hot Weather3," If your legs are swollen, you can lay on your back with your legs propped up above your head. This will help reduce the swelling. If the swelling is consistently bad, try sleeping like this., Don’t cause yourself pain, but massage the area where you notice swelling. Rub the muscles firmly to reduce fluid build-up in your muscles., If you find yourself sitting or standing in one position for a long time, take a moment to stretch. Each hour, take just 2-5 minutes to stretch. Ankle pumps, quad stretches, and calf stretches are a great way to get the blood flow without doing a lot of movement. You can do these stretches silently at your desk or while standing so that it they don’t disrupt your day.


If your hands and fingers feel swollen, focus on shoulder and back stretches.

Make a disaster plan with your family.,
Prune your trees regularly.,
Secure or plan to store outdoor objects.",How to Prepare for a Thunderstorm1," Plan to stay indoors whenever a thunderstorm is approaching. For severe thunderstorms, designate a safe place in your house where your family can gather. Choose a location that’s away from windows, skylights, and glass doors.Make sure you plan for your pets as well. If possible, designate a family member to bring your pets inside during a thunderstorm.;
, Cut away any dead or rotting tree branches as soon as you notice them. Similarly, remove any dead trees in your yard. Thunderstorms produce high winds that can topple weak branches and trees, causing property damage, injury, and death.


Check your local government website to find out how to dispose of dead tree debris properly. Each city has different rules and you could be fined if you don’t follow them.
If you don’t want to prune your own trees hire a tree service to do it for you.

, Patio furniture, grills, smokers, and flower pots can become lethal projectiles in high winds.If possible, secure the outdoor furniture with cinderblocks or strong tethers. Otherwise, create a plan that allows you to quickly store the outdoor objects in a gardening shed.


Practice storing the items and time yourself. Try to do it as quickly as you can. It’s better to be indoors with unsecured outdoor furniture than caught outside in a storm.

Wear wicking underwear.,
Wear long pants.,
Cover your arms.,
Dress for the weather.,
Wear moisture-wicking socks.,
Invest in good boots.,
Don't forget a hat.,
Remember sunglasses and sunscreen.,
Use a lightweight backpack.,
Bring plenty of water.,
Bring food.,
Pack vital survival supplies.",How to Dress for Desert Conditions," Start with undergarments that are made from synthetic nylon, polyester or spandex blends and offer moisture wicking. That means less chafing and more comfort. Women might want to wear a sports bra, which are built for warm and sweaty conditions., Yes, it's hot, but protecting your skin from the elements is vital. Think loose, lightweight cotton pants in light colors, such as khakis or cargo pants. Looser pants keep air moving and help evaporate sweat. Long pants also help protect your legs from spiny plants.

, Long-sleeved, slightly loose cotton shirts are your best bet. Make sure your collarbone and chest are covered too. Choose light colors that help reflect the sun's rays.Layering a t-shirt or tank top may be helpful under your long-sleeved shirt, so you can remove your top layer in shady spots and cool off a bit. Choose a close-fitting, wicking fabric.

, Deserts can get surprisingly cold at night. A windproof shell will protect against gusts. For cooler months or nights, a fleece pullover is ideal. Fleece dries quickly and can be used as a pillow in a pinch. If you get lost or stuck, a jacket or space blanket can help prevent hypothermia., If your feet aren't happy, the rest of you won't be either. Make sure they're a snug-fitting blend that wicks moisture, and rise to crew length (mid-calf), so no sun or scorpions can sneak through.It may seem counterintuitive, but merino wool is a great bet for a natural wicking fabric on hot summer days. It also repels odors.Avoid all-cotton socks, which keep moisture close to your feet and can cause blisters.

, This is the place to spend the most money. Boots are a vital part of your gear, and can protect you from injury, snakes, spines and heat. Wearing higher-cut hiking boots offers additional ankle support. You may need to go a size up from your normal shoes.


Choose a sturdy, slip-free sole that will work well on rocks and rough terrain. Depending on terrain, you'll probably want trail or rough-trail rated boots. Look for a pair that's got some ventilation for hot desert conditions.Look for adequate padding around your ankle, which is critical for long-wear comfort.When trying on boots, make sure you wear the same socks you'll be wearing to hike.

, Wide-brimmed is best, but if you're attached to your baseball cap, add a bandana to cover your neck. Add a strap to make sure strong winds don't carry your hat away. , Make sure they offer complete UV protection. Look for a broad-spectrum sunscreen, at least SPF 30. Apply liberally to any exposed skin, including lips and hands. Bring a small tube for reapplying.

, Pick one that fits comfortably and distributes weight evenly. Travel light. Your heaviest items should be water and food., Being dehydrated in the desert can be deadly. A good rule of thumb is to drink a liter per hour, more if you're hiking in temperatures above 85F/30C. , You'll need quick energy with all the calories hiking in the desert can burn. Sports bars, trail mix, sandwiches, dried fruit and jerky are popular options. Look for non-perishable options. , A first aid kit, signal mirror, flashlight and compass should be in your pack. You may not need them, but if you do, you'll be glad to have them on hand. "

Get out in the cold.,
Take cold showers.,
Gain weight.,
Exercise regularly.",How to Get Used to Cold Temperatures1," If you want to be able to get used to the cold, you’ll have to actually get out in it. If it’s late fall or winter, or if you live in an area with a year-round cold climate, spend a couple hours outside every day. Only wear as much warm clothing as necessary, and shed layers once you get more comfortable. With time, you’ll be be able to spend longer and longer outside and be affected less by the temperature.When spending long durations outside, try wearing gloves, boots and a hat, but leaving the jackets inside. It’s usually the extremities that get cold quickest, and number fingers or ears might make you call it quits long before the rest of your body actually gets too cold.Try driving around without the heat on in your car when you have to get out. For more of a challenge, roll the windows down.;
, Turn the shower faucet opposite the direction that you’re used to when taking your daily shower. Taking cold showers can be supremely uncomfortable, but it’s a good head-first way to begin building up the body’s tolerance to immersion in cold temperatures, and it’s the closest many of us are likely to get to the practices like Arctic Sea diving that help bodies begin to make physiological adaptations to cold.Build up to cold showers by decreasing the temperatures that you’re used to bathing in a little at a time. If you try to go too cold too soon, you may not be able to withstand an entire shower.
You might also try alternating between hot and cold water when showering to get used to rapid changes in temperature similar to when you step outside., The function of the body’s fat stores is to provide a steady supply of calories to burn for energy, and to act as cushioning layer to protect and keep the body’s internal organs at a consistent temperature. While not necessarily an attractive option, gaining body fat will keep you that much warmer when conditions are frigid.Putting on a little extra body fat should be done with discretion; you should still aim to eat a balanced, healthy diet, just with a moderate increase in the amount of calories you ordinarily consume.
Eating foods rich in protein, carbohydrates and healthy fats, such as lean meats, dairy, starchy whole grains and vegetable oils is a time-tested way to put on weight without placing undue stress on the heart and digestive system., Start performing cardiovascular and resistance training sessions multiple times per week. Your body’s metabolism, which is responsible for breaking down calories to release energy, helps regulate your average body temperature, and becomes more efficient when adapting to the effects of intense exercise. In other words, working out will cause you run a bit hotter, as your metabolism will be kept in a healthy, revved up state.Increasing muscle mass will help you stay warm on its own, as it’s simply more warm tissue packed on the body.With cardiovascular exercise, your heart and lungs’ ability to circulate oxygen-rich blood will improve, making the whole machine run better.

Watch the weather.,
Unplug any electrical equipment.,
Stay away from water.,
Follow the thirty minute rule.,
Find shelter if you’re outside.,
Stay in your car.",How to Prepare for a Thunderstorm2," Monitor the weather by watching the local forecast on TV, checking the newspaper, searching online, or signing up for text message notifications from your local government. With the advancement of technology, most thunderstorms can be predicted more than a day in advance. The more warning you have the more time you’ll have to prepare for the worst.


Cancel any outdoor plans during a thunderstorm. Even if the weather doesn't seem bad you could still be hit by lightning.

, The lighting from thunderstorms can cause power surges that can damage or destroy electronics. This is especially important for computers and expensive electronics. However, make sure you unplug the electronics before the storm approaches. If you’re touching an appliance during a power surge you’ll get electrocuted.If you have electronics that you don’t want to unplug, purchase a surge protector power strip from an electronics store.

, Avoid taking showers, washing your hands, or bathing. The metal pipes in bathroom fixtures can conduct electricity. If you’re showering when lighting strikes, you may be electrocuted. Similarly, stay away from pools as water conducts electricity as well.


Avoid indoor pools. Some indoor pools have metal fixtures that can conduct electricity. Play it safe and stay out of the pool.

, The National Weather Service recommends that you stay inside for at least thirty minutes after hearing the last peal of thunder. Even if you’re sure that the worst of the storm is over it’s better to wait than to go outside. Lighting can still strike you even if the storm has moved.Avoid swimming in water for at least an hour, if not for the rest of the day.

, Shelter inside a safe building or get into a hard-topped vehicle if you can. If you can’t, avoid all open fields and tall, isolated trees. Stay away from water, metal objects, and hilltops. If possible, shelter among a lower grouping of trees. This will slightly reduce your risk of getting hit by lightning.If you’re camping, leave the tent to find shelter. Tents do not offer protection from lightning.

, If you’re driving in a hard-topped vehicle during a lightning storm, stay in your car until the storm passes. If your car is struck by lightning, the current will flow over the body of the car and into the ground. Watch out for flooding on the road as well. If there’s a lot of water on the road in front of you, pull over and wait for the storm to pass.Golf carts and convertible cars don’t offer any lightning protection.
Your car may sustain damage to the tires or the electrical system if struck by lightning.

"

Stock your home for emergencies.,
Shutter all windows and lock all doors.,
Stay in your designated safe place.",How to Prepare for a Thunderstorm3," Sometimes severe weather forces people to stay indoors for days at a time. Make sure you have enough water, non-perishable food, medication, personal hygiene items, and batteries to last at least seven days. Store extra flashlights, tools, and cell phone chargers nearby that are only for emergencies. If possible, include extra cash just in case you have to evacuate. You may not be able to reach an ATM.Buy a hand-crank radio to use if the power goes out. The radio will be an invaluable source of information if you need to evacuate.
Stock one gallon of water per person per day.

, High winds can break windows and doors, hurling glass and wood debris through the air. Shuttering the windows and locking the doors helps protect them from the wind and airborne debris outside.If you don’t have any shutters on your windows, close them as best you can and cover them with blinds, shades, or curtains.
If your door doesn’t lock push a heavy piece of furniture in front of it to keep it closed.

, Don’t leave during the storm to search for people. If you need to reach someone, use your cell phone. If you use a landline you risk being electrocuted.If you’re worried about debris falling on your head, cover yourself with a thick blanket or hide under a mattress.


Don’t touch electrical outlets or appliances that are plugged in.
Keep away from any windows or doors.

Turn down the thermostat.,
Get out of the habit of covering up.,
Drink ice water.,
Enjoy cold-weather activities.",How to Get Used to Cold Temperatures2," Just as you’ve been getting used to the cold outside, you should be making an effort to get acclimated to the cold inside as well. People most often keep the temperature in their homes in the low- to mid-seventies, as this is most hospitable to the body’s equilibrium. Try turning yours down a few degrees at a time until you can stand living in a cooler space.Toughing out a cold house is also a great way to save on the cost of utilities during the winter. Just check with your family or roommates first if you don’t live alone.

, The next time you get chilly and you’re tempted to grab a cozy throw blanket or pair of house shoes, don’t. Instead, bear it, and do something to take your mind off the chill if you need to. The idea is to break yourself of the need to always be covered up with warm layers when it’s cold and instead learn to cope with it on your own. If you’ve gotten used to living in cooler temperatures and have been taking cold showers routinely, this step should be a breeze.


If you find yourself having a hard time resisting that comforter or quilt, fold it and put it away on the top shelf of a closet. You’ll be less likely to reach for it if it’s put away and you have to go to the trouble of getting it out again.
Your body temperature naturally drops slightly when you sleep, so if you want a crash course in developing willpower, train yourself to sleep without a blanket!, Make ice water your go-to drink of choice, even in the dead of winter. Ingesting an icy beverage lowers your internal temperature ever-so-slightly, which will force your body’s adaptive responses to compensate for the change. Whereas most people turn to coffee or hot chocolate in the colder months to get warm, you should be doing the opposite. Eventually, you’ll no longer even feel the need to warm up.In addition to being a useful tool for building up your cold tolerance, ice water is also usually free and can be found almost anywhere.

, Desensitizing yourself to the cold doesn’t have to be all stern-faced discipline. Take up an outdoor winter sport like sledding, skiing or snowboarding and give yourself a fun way to get outside while everyone else is huddled up indoors. You’ll become one with the cold much faster, and you’ll also have an enjoyable way to pass the cold months instead remaining cooped up.Take a camping trip in the late fall or winter for a head-first approach to dealing with cold. Once you’re in the wild, you’ll have no choice but to sleep on the cold ground out in the elements, and your body will thank you!
Chances are, you’ll begin to get overheated after a few hours of intense skiing or snowboard, demonstrating just how much heat your body is capable of generating on its own. This should give you a confidence boost for your own ability to overcome the cold."

Feel the actual temperature.,
Imagine that it’s even colder.,
Stop shivering.,
Know that cold is usually not a threat.",How to Get Used to Cold Temperatures3," Rather than just thinking about how cold you feel when you step outside, concentrate on feeling the exact temperature of your environment. There’s usually a stark difference: you’re hardly ever as cold as you think you are. Try to accurately gauge the cold around you so that you’re not exaggerating your response to it.Learning to feel how cold you actually are is part of taking control over your unconscious responses to stress.

, It may be a little brisk out for your liking, but what if it was even colder? This is a mental trick to keep things in perspective that will serve to make cold conditions not seem so bad by comparison. If you remind yourself that there are people living in much colder places like Antarctica or Siberia without complaining, a Midwestern winter evening won’t seem quite so harsh anymore., Whenever you find yourself shivering, force yourself to stop. Shivering is one of the body’s heat-generating mechanisms when it’s cold, but conditions generally have to be pretty extreme for there to be an actual need for the physiological response. If the temperature outside is right around or just below freezing and you find yourself shivering uncontrollably, you’re probably overreacting.


Shivering is an autonomic process in the body that produces heat by forcing the muscles to make tiny, rapid contractions, similar to the effects of exercise.Research has demonstrated that shivering in non-freezing conditions is mostly unnecessary and doesn’t have a much effect on combating mild cold., It’s instinctual to react with discomfort to unusual conditions, but discomfort and danger are two different things. There’s usually no harm in being in a cold environment, as long as the cold is not severe enough to actually lower to body’s core temperature and exposure is not overly prolonged.Cold exposure doesn’t become life-threatening until it drops the core body temperature to around 95 degrees Fahrenheit, before which time you’d be better off swallowing your pride and finding a place of refuge with heat."

Start prepping.,
Shipping containers are built to to be stacked, so they are strong vertically, but the sides are too weak to have tons of dirt pressing onto them.,
Make or buy a ship type hatch that can be dogged down tight, yet still be able to open wide to accommodate large items.

,
Set the container in the ground.,
Use concrete blocks for the bottom of the hole you have dug.,
Push the dirt back into the hole.,
Make your shelter comfortable.",How to Make a Cargo Container Shelter," All over the U.S. and in other countries there are stacks of used cargo containers. The owners don't make money when they have to ship them back empty so they sell them off to be cut up for scrap or even turned into portable housing. Looking up cargo containers on Google will give you some idea of what can be done with a steel box that is approximately 10 X 10 x 20, 30 or even 40 feet (12.2 m) long.;
, Tornadoes and hurricanes only strike during specific times of the year, so the off-season is, of course, the best time to install a cargo container shelter.

, Modify the doors, which should be made for quick entry. There are several other things that have to be done, such as making the container airtight..

, They need some kind of reinforcement for underground use.

,, Once the doors have been modified it is now time to place the container in the ground and no you're not going to bury the whole thing, the hole will only be one foot wider than the container and only a foot longer with a ramp at the door/hatch end for quick entry and exit and only half as deep as the container is high.

, The bottom of the hole should be prepared with either a set of concrete blocks or a solid footing for the container to rest on depending on weather and ground water and on how the container will be put into the hole, pushed in or dropped in by a crane.

, The dirt taken from the hole would then be pushed back into the open sides and far end creating a slope up to the top on three sides. The top of the container can then be covered by planking to make a nice deck or even have a nice gazebo for summer.

, The inside can be made as comfortable as you want or left as is but when the storm season comes you just may have to live in it till your house is rebuilt. Once it is in the ground and ramped with earth it would take an exceptionally strong wind to blow it away.

Stay informed.,
Bring the appropriate clothing.,
Know that afternoon showers are so predictable in Florida, you can literally set your watch to them.,
Beat the heat.,
Lather on sunblock.,
Realize the threat of hurricanes.,
Most importantly, don't worry obsessively about the weather during your visit.",How to Prepare for the Weather in Florida," It's always a good idea to check the local forecast whether on TV, on the Internet or in the Weather section of the newspaper. If it calls for rain in the afternoon, get an early start. If it'll be wet in the morning, plan to spend the afternoon outside instead. Websites like Weather.com have helpful hour-by-hour forecasts and live radar maps of almost every city in the state.;
, Temperatures in Florida will obviously vary by season, but you can't rule out the possibility of a surprisingly mild day or cool night, so it wouldn't hurt to pack a sweater or even a pair or two of long pants and shoes that don't expose your feet.

, These storms happen almost every day (usually during the late spring and throughout the summer) and produce torrential rain, sometimes gusty winds, and spectacular lightning shows. For this reason, it's no wonder Florida has been dubbed as the Lightning Capital of the United States.

, The climate in Florida is warm year-round, but during the summer it will be especially hot and humid. Remember to drink plenty of water and rest in the shade frequently so you don't get weak or ill from the sometimes overwhelming humidity.

, The sun in Florida is especially powerful and will burn unprotected skin within a matter of minutes, especially during the summer and when the sun is directly overhead and at its strongest. Young children and elderly people will burn even more quickly than average adults, so it's wise to apply a strong sunblock (SPF 50 and over is a good idea) when you first set out and to keep reapplying several times throughout the day.

, They will usually affect areas along the coast of South Florida (like Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Key West, Naples, etc.), but by the time a hurricane is imminent most vacationers have already left to avoid getting caught in the middle of it all.

, While you should always be cautious, Florida is a beautiful state and there is a lot to do, from spending a day at the beach to exploring the theme parks of Walt Disney World. Just focus primarily on having a good time, and when the wet weather does happen, it will typically be brief and remain dry throughout the rest of the day.

Before approaching the flooded road with your vehicle, decrease your speed or stop completely.,
As you are slowing down or stopping before the flooded road, turn on your hazard lights for indication and visualize the area of the flooded road and see if it is not very deep, depending of your vehicle type.,
After checking all of the main aspects, now while the hazard lights are still on, turn off the air conditioning (AC) if possible in your vehicle so that the fan in the engine compartment would not be damaged by the flow of the flood water you are driving.,
Now all of those are applied, drive slowly through the flood while you can open a bit of your vehicle windows for air circulation if possible and drive carefully.,
Don't stop in the middle of the flooded road especially if the flood is deep otherwise water would damage the engine of your vehicle.,
As your vehicle is approaching to the high level of the road, the flood water decreases and you can speed up your vehicle carefully.,
If your car shuts down after or during the flood, stay calm and ask for help.,After all aspects are clearly maintained and done, drive as usually and safely

",How to Drive Through a Flooded Area,";
, Ensure your vehicle has sufficient weight so it would not float during the flood.

, And put the gear of your vehicle to the highest, for manual transmission put it to (1) and for automatic transmission put it to (+ -) and put it the (1) or first gear

, Remember to keep the throttle/acceleration in balance and high and it is normal to growl the engine in a flood so that flood water won't enter the engine through the exhaust pipe at the rear of your vehicle and while driving, also press and maintain with the clutch for M/T so that the engine would not shut down

, And while driving, visualize the area around you especially the front and check the mirrors too.

If there is a halo that becomes wider around the moon, rain and winds are likely to be on their way.If there is a dark, low-looking sky and there is a warm feeling in the air all of a sudden, this can be an indicator of snow on its way. It will usually go very still and there are usually no winds unless it's a nor'easter.






If the sky is clear and star-filled during wintertime, this will probably mean that there will be frosts during the night with a sunny day to follow.






If the stars have a dull appearance and don't seem to twinkle, there is a possibility of rain in the morning.

, Some signs include:


If there are white, fluffy clouds, the weather will stay fine for about 12 hours.






If the sun feels very hot as soon as it rises, the day will be very hot.






If the sky darkens quickly, producing low, dark clouds, find shelter quickly so that you aren't standing around in a storm. Low, dark clouds usually bring heavy rain or snow.






If the clouds are low, dark, and stretched out, there will be bad weather soon.

Know the benefits of acclimating your body to the heat.,
Recognize that acclimation only lasts about two weeks.,
Be aware of the risks of heat illness.,
Allow 10 to 14 days to acclimate your body to the heat.,
Perform small increments of intense activity.,
Work up to 100 minutes of outdoor exercise.,
Increase your fluid intake with water or sports drinks.,
Maintain the heat acclimation.,
Replace lost water.,
Wear light weight exercise clothing.,
Eat enough calories to replace burned calories.",How to Acclimate to Hot Weather," Acclimating to heat actually results in physiological changes within your body. These changes make it much easier to exercise or work in a climate that is very hot. The following are some of the changes you can expect to feel after acclimating yourself:


You may possess greater comfort during work, play, or exercise while exposed to hot weather.
You can have improved work and exercise performance.
Acclimating to heat can lower your body heat production, heart rate, core temperature, and salt loss.
You may have improved organ protection, skin blood flow, and sweating.;
, Unfortunately, the physiological changes that occur when your body acclimates to hot weather only last about two weeks if you do not actively exercise in the heat. Once the heat exposure ends, the adaptations begin to fade.You will start to feel the effects fading within one week of no exercise in the hot weather.


Cardiovascular improvements are usually the first changes that start to go away.

, There are many causes of heat illness that are good to be aware of before you begin your acclimation process. Heat illness can be caused by dehydration, low level of fitness, current bacterial or viral infection, sleep deprivation, inappropriate clothing, and drugs and/or medications. Being aware of these risk factors can help you prevent heat illness.It is best to have a medium-to-high level of fitness before you begin to acclimate your body to hot weather.

, Make a schedule to start your acclimation process. It usually takes about two weeks of at least one hour of training in the heat each day to acclimate.


Find some time in your schedule to exercise for one-two hours a day for two weeks straight during hot weather.
If the weather isn’t very hot, but you still want to acclimate, you can wear extra clothing during your workout to simulate high heat conditions or train in a very hot room.

, When you first begin, you may find that you are easily fatigued by the hot weather. Start your acclimation process with about 15 minutes of intense exercise the first day. For the first week, increase the time and intensity of your workout by no more than 20% each day.


In the first 5 days of heat acclimation, your body improves its cardiovascular functions in the heat.
For best results, use interval training: alternating periods of rest and exercise.

, Continue your acclimation until you can comfortably exercise for 100 minutes in the hot weather. If you feel fatigued or overheated, stop exercising immediately. One hundred minutes is a goal to strive for, but if it takes you longer than two weeks to get up to it, that’s okay.


During the first 8 days, your body-core temperature is adjusted.
Resting in the heat, without physical activity, will not acclimate your body to the heat.

, Staying hydrated is extremely important when working or exercising in hot weather. Dehydration can result in decreased blood flow to the skin, decreased sweat production, reduced blood volume, and an increase in your core body temperature. The water lost from sweat must be replaced while exercising.Be sure to drink fluids both during the workout and when you are done. Because high heat results in an increased fluid loss, don’t wait until your feel thirsty. Drink frequently.
More sodium will be retained by the body and less excreted in your sweat and urine if you have more fluid in the body. This allows the body to maintain its proper sodium concentrations.
Consume enough sodium to replace what is lost by sweating. A low-sodium diet may impair your body's ability to maintain its sodium levels.

, It only takes about one week for you to start feeling the loss of the physiological changes you worked so hard for.To maintain these changes, you need to continue to work out in the heat at least every other day.


Keep to a regular schedule of outdoor exercise (at least 2-3 times per week).

, It is important to replace all of the water you have lost while exercising outside. Staying hydrated during the actual exercise is important, but it is just as important to replace all of the water that has been lost at the end of your routine. Weigh yourself before and after your workout to determine approximately how much water has been lost.


For each pound lost, drink about half a quart of water (or sports drink) to replace it.

, The type of clothing worn while in hot weather is very important. While you are acclimating and when you’re working/exercising, wear lightweight, moisture-wicking clothing. This type of clothing will help keep your body cool and you comfortable. Heavy clothing that does not dry quickly will leave you hot and uncomfortable.Make sure it is light-colored, loose-fitting, and breathable for maximum cooling.
Remember to wear sunscreen and sunglasses to protect your skin and eyes from sun damage.

, Just as you must replace water, you must replace the calories that were burned during the exercise. Food consumption is equally as important as water. Food also replaces many of the minerals that are lost in sweat.


It is recommended to maintain a 2,100 calorie diet during rigorous heat training.

Dress for the weather.,
Stay hydrated with cool drinks.,
Make a cold compress.,
Limit your exercise.",How to Beat the Summer Heat1," No matter what you're doing in the summer heat, you'll be happier if you're wearing clothes that keep you as cool as possible. Your clothes can play a big role in how hot you feel, so take a moment to consider your outfit before you leave the house in the summer. A good summer outfit:


Is made from mostly breathable fabrics like cotton, linen, or artificial fabrics that ""wick"" sweat away from the skin.Uses mostly light colors like white and light blue, which absorb less heat from the sun.Is fairly loose-fitting, allowing air to flow next to the skin. Shorts, dresses, flowing gowns, and looser shirts work well.
Doesn't leave much naked skin exposed to the sun. Especially important for people vulnerable to sunburn.;
, While it's always important to stay hydrated, your water intake needs special attention in the summer. Getting plenty to drink when you're in the sun won't just make you feel cooler — it's also important for your heart and muscles.Try keeping a bottle of water with a few ice cubes in it with you whenever you go out in the summer so that you'll always have something to drink.


When it comes to hydration, plain old water is usually the best choice. If you're exercising extra hard in the summer heat for longer than about an hour, a sports drink (e.g., Gatorade, etc.) can give you a boost of carbohydrates and electrolytes.However, these drinks tend to contain lots of sugar, so balance your consumption with your daily nutrition needs.

, If you need to cool off right away, it's nice to have a cold compress handy. A cold compress is just something cold that you can hold against your skin to lower your temperature. There are many different ways to make one — see our article on cold compresses for a few different ideas. Below is just one easy recipe:


Take a clean rag or sock and soak it in water from the sink. Wring it out to remove excess water so that it is still damp. Place it in a plastic bag in the freezer.
After a few hours, take the compress out and lay it across the back of your neck. It should quickly have you feeling cooler. Re-soak it and return it to the freezer when you're done.

, The more you move, the more heat your body generates. If your goal is staying cool, try not to use your muscles more than you need to. Walk around your neighborhood instead of running, coast on your bicycle instead of pumping your pedals, or simply consider driving if it's an option.


Most important of all, take plenty of breaks. Resting allows your body to dissipate some of the heat you've built up from exercising.

Seek some form of shelter ASAP.,
Know what to do depending on the shelter type you have sought:
Car - if you are in a car, you are safe; lightning travels through the metal frame of the car to the ground, and not through you.,
If there is no shelter at all nearby, crouch in a low lying ditch.,
Never hide under a tree during a storm.,
Note that lightning often strikes the same place twice, so don't go thinking that if you see lightning hit something, you should go there for safety.,
Be patient.",How to Avoid Being Struck by Lightning When Caught Unawares," If you are nowhere near the usual buildings of a city, town, or national park offices, you need to find alternative shelter immediately.;
, (FYI, it's a myth that the tires prevent a car from being struck - lightning can easily overcome the electrical resistance of rubber tires!!!). If you are outside, touching the metal and a lightning bolt strikes the car, you will probably die from electrocution, so be aware.






Building of some type (e.g., back country hut, shack, shed, ruins etc.) - if you are in a building of any sort, do not use any electric appliances just in case if lightning strikes your house or a nearby power line, you could be shocked. If the building is in ruins, crouch down low as there may be nothing above to protect you.







, Get down as low as you can and keep down. Avoid being near high objects that will attract the lightning.

, Since trees are positive charged, and the lightning is negative charged, the tree will probably be struck. Lightning always seeks the highest object.

, When you are crouched in the ditch, stay there until the storm has completely passed your area.

, Wait 30 more minutes since at the last strike time, as lightning strikes are still possible. If you feel your hair stand on end, that means that lightning strikes are possible again, and you should probably return to your shelter.

Keep the air moving.,
Vent hot air out of the top of the house in the evening.,
Hang wet towels across the windows if you live in a dry climate.,
Get a dehumidifier if you live in a humid climate.",How to Beat the Summer Heat2," One of the ways the body cools off is by letting heat transfer from the skin into the air around it. If the air is moving quicker, more heat can transfer and the body can cool off quicker. You can't control how hot it is outside or whether there's a breeze, but if you have a fan, you can keep things cooler in your house. The faster the air moves, the cooler you'll feel, so higher speeds have more of a cooling effect.


Ceiling fans are great for circulating the air in an entire room. You'll want most fans to run counter-clockwise in the summer. This pushes the air downward onto you, creating a minor ""windchill"" effect.If you don't have a ceiling fan, smaller desktop fans work well. Point them at your face for constant comfort or set them on a rotating cycle to circulate the air in the room.

, Warm air tends to rise.This means that when it's hot, the highest part of your house will tend to have the hottest air. If your house has more than one story, you can use this fact to your advantage by creating a cooling air current in your house. See below for directions:


When you leave the house during the day, keep the windows closed and curtains drawn. Warm air will naturally rise to the top floors of your house and get trapped.
When you get home in the evening, open a window on the top floor. Point a fan (large box fans are best) so that it blows air out of this window.
Open a few windows on the bottom floor of your house. Keep the doors inside your house open.
The fan will blow the hot air out of the top floor, sending it outside. Cool evening air will flow through the lower windows and rush upward to replace it, creating a pleasant breeze.

, A cool, moist breeze can feel fantastic when it's hot out. If you live in an area with dry weather, try putting a little moisture in the air by soaking a towel and hanging it in front of an open window. Open all the windows on the same floor to start a draft that will carry moisture in and cool you.


You can also get the same effect by hanging a wet towel across a fan.

, When it's too humid, sweat doesn't evaporate very easily, which makes it harder for your body to cool you naturally.Luckily, a device called a dehumidifier can pull the moisture out of the air, making it easier for your body to cool itself. Dehumidifiers are available from hardware stores in a wide variety of sizes and prices.


Most commercial air conditioners also remove humidity from the air.

Hang out in the shade at the park.,
Treat yourself to a cool dessert.,
Go for a swim.,
Have a water fight.",How to Beat the Summer Heat3," If your house is hot and stuffy, go somewhere you'll be able to feel a nice, cool breeze. Relaxing in the shade at your local park is a great way to pass the time while escaping the misery that can come with intense summer heat. Bring a book to read, a light picnic snack, or just chat with a few friends — it's up to you!

, Nothing makes ice-cold treats taste extra delicious like hot summer sunlight. Best of all, these sorts of frozen delicacies can be enjoyed at home or while out and about. For instance, a walk to an ice cream parlor is a great way to kill time when it's scorching out, but you can also buy ice cream or even make your own — it's up to you! A few cool desserts you may want to try include:


Ice cream
Popsicles

Lemonade (or frozen lemonade)
Snow cones

, The body loses heat in water much quicker than it loses heat in air.Taking a dip will cool you down rapidly. It doesn't matter where you swim — pools are just as good as lakes and oceans for getting cool. See our swimming safety articles before you get in the water.


If you're swimming out in the sun, don't forget to apply sunscreen to prevent a painful sunburn. Get someone to help you get your back — being embarrassed is no reason to get burnt.

, Water balloons, squirt guns, and hoses are all great ways to get cool while having a little friendly competition. If you're just hanging out with a few friends, try dividing up your ""weapons"" and having a free-for-all. If you're in a big group, divide into teams and wage full-scale war.


You may want to avoid this option if you live somewhere where water is scarce or a drought is occurring. This activity is entertaining, but it's a fairly wasteful use of water.

Make sure you get a waterproof outer shell.,
Select the right type of insulation.,
Look at zippers and cuffs.,
Check a coat to make sure it's high quality before buying it.,
Choose your material.,
Try a trench coat.,
Invest in a pea coat.,
Opt for a traditional parka.,
Think about a military jacket.,
Try looking for a removable hood.,
Seek out stylish extras that add warmth.,
Find coats with storm flaps.",How to Choose a Stylish and Practical Winter Coat," During winter, you will need a water proof coat. You do not want a coat that will get damaged by snow and rain. Make sure the outer shell of any coat you choose is marked as water resistant.Check the label to see if the coat's material is waterproof. You should also see how many layers of waterproof material cover the coat. The more layers, the better protection you will have against water.
Materials that feel similar to a rain coat are more likely to block out water.
Make sure your coat is insulated. Not all coats, like wool and leather coats, have insulation. This may be important if you live in a very cold area.;
, There are three types of insulation for a winter coat: down, synthetic, and pile fabric. Choose an insulation that will keep you warm in the winter months.Down is a classic insulator, and is great for providing warmth in the winter. The main downside, however, is that it does not hold up as well against moisture. If you live in a environment prone to a lot of precipitation, down may not be the best choice for you.
Synthetic fibers tend to hold up better against moisture. However, synthetic fibers do not last as long as other options. They tend to wear down faster over time.
Pile fabric is similar to sheep's wool. It is water resistant and lasts longer than synthetic fabric. However, it's difficult to make a very thick coat with synthetic fabric. If you need something very thick for the winter, try a different insulator.

, You want to make sure you're protected from the cold. Examine zippers and cuffs to make sure they're made from high quality material that will last.Sometimes, fabrics in coats are waterproof but the zippers are not. Check the label to make sure any zipper used is waterproof. If you're buying a parka, look for a two-way zipper for added warmth.
Make sure the cuffs of any jacket you choose are tight. Tighter cuffs will provide you with more protection from the rain and snow.

, Once you've found a coat you like, examine it to make sure it really is high quality. Examine the seams to make sure there's no thread hanging out. Make sure there are no holes where fabric is escaping. Stitching should not go through the insulation in a coat.It's also a good idea to review a store's return policy, just in case you don't like the coat after taking it home.

, In terms of style, think about the material you like. Coats come in a variety of materials and you want to choose one that's appealing to your sense of style.Leather coats are both stylish and durable. If you like the look of leather, a leather coat can be a great option for you. If you like the look of leather and want something more casual, you can try suede.
Wool coats are also durable and come in a variety of stylish cuts. You can also choose wool in a variety of colors, so wool can be great if you're looking for a specific color.
A cotton coat is similar to wool, but may hold up better in the rain. However, it may not be as warm as wool.
A faux fur coat can be great for a vintage style.

, Trench coats are a popular item if you like the look of a long, slimming coat. Trench coats are generally weather resistant and light weight.Trench coats can generally be worn with any type of outfit, so if you want one coat to last you all season this is a great option. They can be worn in many temperatures as well as in many different situations.

, A pea coat is a great gender neutral coat that is considered a style classic. If you want something that will be in style for years to come, opt for a pea coat made out of quality materials.Go for a double breasted pea coat for added warmth.
The one downside to a pea coat is that they are not very long. They may not be the best option if you live in a very cold area.

, A parka can be as stylish as any other coat option if you opt for a classic cut. Parkas have a more relaxed style, if that's what you're looking for, and are excellent for very cold areas.Parkas are great if you prefer something with a looser fit. If you feel more comfortable and stylish with something that sags a little, go for a parka., Military jackets are stylish options for both men and women and tend to stay in style long term. Military jackets are both warm and form fitting, so they're somewhat in between a parka and a pea coat.Military jackets have a double-breasted closure, which can be great for extra warmth., A hood is a great option for a winter coat, especially if you live in a cold area. However, you may not want a hood on all the time. If it gets warmer out, a hood can be bulky. See if you can find a jacket in your style with a removable hood. This will make your coat more versatile., There are a variety of extras that come with certain coats. Look for extras that serve more than an aesthetic purpose. Extras should also add warmth.Things like drawstrings, fur ruffs, and fleece-lined pockets all add extra warmth.

, It's important your zippers are covered by wind flaps. If you live in an area prone to extreme weather and wind, wind can cut right through a zipper. This will leave you cold. A wind flap is vital to any winter wardrobe."
"
Put a mask over your nose and mouth.,
Protect your eyes.,
Look for shelter.,
Get to high ground.,
Shield yourself from flying objects.,
Wait out the storm.",How to Survive a Dust Storm or Sandstorm1," If you have a respirator or mask designed to filter out small particulates, put it on immediately. If you don't have a mask, wrap a bandanna or some other piece of cloth around your nose and mouth. Moisten it a bit if you have enough water. Apply a small amount of petroleum jelly to the inside of your nostrils to prevent drying of your mucous membranes.;
, Eyeglasses offer minimal protection from blowing dust or sand, but airtight goggles are better. If you don't have goggles, shield your face with your arm as you move, then wrap a piece of cloth tightly around your head to protect your eyes and ears.

, Even a parked car will do, so long as it is off the road in not in danger of getting hit. When possible, enclosures are your best bet. However, anything ""leeward"" (shielding you from the direction of the wind) of the storm will be better than nothing.Sand will bounce around when it hits objects, so you should still try to cover as much of your skin and face as possible.
If you cannot get to shelter, crouch down. It minimizes the chance you'll get hit by something flying.

, The densest concentration of sand or dust bounces close to the ground, so the storm will be less forceful at the top of a hill. Seek high ground if you can find a safe, solid, high point, but only if the storm is not accompanied by lightning and there is no danger of being struck by heavier flying debris.


Do not lie in a ditch, as flash flooding may occur even if no rain is falling where you are. In the actual dust cloud, rain generally dries up before it reaches the ground, but it may be raining nearby, and ditches, arroyos, and other low-lying areas can quickly flood.
If you have a camel, have it sit down and press yourself against its leeward side. Camels are well adapted to surviving in dust storms.
If you're in sand dunes, do not seek shelter right on the leeward side of the dune. The high winds can pick up huge amounts of sand very quickly, and you could find yourself being buried in sand.

, Seek out a large rock or other landform to protect you at least partially. Cover as much of your body as possible to protect yourself from flying sand. Wind-propelled sand can hurt, but a dust storm's high winds can also carry heavier (more dangerous) objects. If you find yourself without shelter, try to stay low to the ground and protect your head with your arms, a backpack or a pillow.

, Don't try to move through the storm; it's much too dangerous. Stay where you are and wait for it to pass before you attempt to move to a different location.


If you can quickly reach such shelter before a dust storm reaches you, get there as quickly as possible and stay inside. Close all windows and doors, and wait out the storm.
If you're with other people, stick together to minimize the chances that someone gets lost.

"

Try safely outrunning the storm.,
Pull the car over and stop.,
Take cover and stay put.",How to Survive a Dust Storm or Sandstorm2," If you see a dust storm from some distance, and you are in a vehicle or have access to one, you may be able to outrun it or detour around it.Some dust storms can travel at more than 75 mph (121 km/h), but they frequently travel much slower. Trying to outrun a storm, however, is not advisable if you have to put yourself at risk by traveling at high speeds. If the storm is catching up with you, it's best to stop and prepare for it. Once consumed by the storm, your visibility can potentially be reduced to zero in a matter of seconds.


Do not try to outrun a storm on foot. Wind storms are unpredictable, and you could be easily overcome if it suddenly changes direction or picks up speed.
Drive to a safe place where you can take shelter until the storm passes.

, If you're in transit and visibility drops to less than 300 feet (91.4 m), pull off the road (exit the freeway if possible), set your parking brake, turn off your headlights, and make sure brake lights and turn signals are also off.


If you are unable to safely pull off the road, keep your headlights on, turn on your hazard lights, slow down, and proceed with caution, sounding your horn periodically. Use the highway's centerline to guide you if you can't see in front of you. Pull over at the nearest safe spot.
Turning your headlights off while stationed off the road will reduce the possibility of a rear-end collision. In many cases, if your exterior lights are on, other drivers will use the taillights of the person in front of them as a guide to help navigate the road ahead of them. If you are pulled off the road and are sitting there with your lights on, someone might think they can follow you and run right off the road or even collide with you.

, Do not attempt to move about in a blinding storm, as you will not be able to see potential hazards in your path.


Roll up the windows and turn off vents that bring outside air in.
Don't move your vehicle until the storm has safely passed.

Know where dust and sand storms occur.,
Heed dust storm warnings.,
Be prepared in case of an emergency.",How to Survive a Dust Storm or Sandstorm3," Both types of storms are most commonly associated with the Sahara and Gobi desert regions, they can occur in any arid or semi-arid climate. If you live in or are traveling in a dusty or sandy place with high winds, prepare yourself in case you get caught in a storm.

, Dust storms are most likely to occur on hot summer days under certain atmospheric conditions, and meteorologists can frequently predict the possibility of these storms. Tune in to local TV or radio broadcasts before traveling in hot, dry conditions, and consider rerouting or delaying your trip if dust storms are predicted. Roadside signs may also be available to warn you of dust storm danger.


If there's a good chance you'll get caught in the storm, it's advisable not to travel at all. Stay home and batten down the hatches so you won't risk getting hurt or damaging your car.

, If you are in a storm-prone area, you should always be aware that a storm could occur. If you'll be outside for a long period of time, wear long sleeves and pants to protect your body. Carry a satchel or keep a box in the trunk of your car filled with items you need in the event of a sand or dust storm. Fill the emergency kit with these items:


A mask designed to filter out small particulates
Airtight goggles
A water supply
A warm blanket, in the event of a winter dust storm, which can quickly lead to hypothermia.

Report losses to your insurance company.",How to Survive a Hurricane," Do you live in a state that gets frequent hurricanes, like Florida, Georgia, or the Carolinas? Agencies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) advise you to be ready before the start of hurricane season, i.e. June 1. Your preparations should include a “Family Disaster Plan” and an “Emergency Disaster Supply Kit” that’s easy for the family to locate in a hurry.A family disaster plan outlines what you will do in an emergency. Plan out your emergency evacuation routes, for example, and try to have several in case a favored one is unusable. Agree on where to meet if you get separated.
Do drills to teach family members how to turn off water, gas, and electricity. Make sure even the youngest know how to call emergency services.
A disaster kit is something to have ready at a moment’s notice. It should have the basic things you’ll need to survive on your own for at least 72 hours, like food, water, a first aid kit, and lights.
Once winds reach tropical force, preparation is impossible and you will have to focus on survival.;
, A generator will ensure that you have electricity after a storm abates, till the power returns. Store it somewhere away from rain and rising water. Know how to use it and pay special attention to proper ventilation.Always make sure a generator is grounded and in a dry area.
Never plug a portable generator into a regular outlet or hook it directly to your home’s wiring, as it can back-feed into the power lines.
To reduce the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning, always run generators outside and away from doors and windows.
Ask for a demonstration from the retailer if you're unsure how to use it.
Generators require regular maintenance and tests. Be sure to follow the instructions to avoid discovering it doesn't work when you need it most.

, You will almost certainly lose electricity during a major hurricane and will not have access to communications or light. Consider having battery or kinetic energy-powered radios and flashlights on hand.A NOAA “All Alerts” weather receiver with a battery backup is best. This radio will let you to listen to regular updates and forecasts from the NOAA. Have it set to alert mode during the threat and make sure it is powered up.
Buy some efficient battery-powered or kinetic lights. The Coleman LED Micropacker is a good model and will light a small area on three AAA batteries for several days. Kinetic-energy lights use mechanical energy from sources like cranks and will never run out of power.
Glowsticks are a safe alternative, too. Given the risk of gas leaks during a storm, you should be very wary of candles.
Keep a large supply of regular batteries, as well, stored in a watertight container.

, A safe room is a structure designed to withstand the federal government’s criteria for an extreme weather event, like a tornado or hurricane. They are often inside homes in an inner room. People who take shelter in a certified safe room are very likely to escape injury or death in a weather emergency.Residential safe rooms are “hardened.” This means that they have been strengthened to withstand high winds, with thickened or reinforced concrete ceiling, floor, and walls and other features.
Safe rooms can be added to a house or retrofitted. You will want to ensure that it is accessible, supplied with water and other essentials, and will be moderately comfortable for occupants. People often choose an interior bathroom for this purpose.
Can’t afford to build a safe room? The federal government offers grants and other funding programs., The majority of hurricane damage comes from high winds, which can either blow away or rip apart anything that’s not well secured. Try to minimize potential damage by acting before the season starts.Since high winds can cause branches and trees to fall, pre-emptively remove any damaged tree limbs near your property before the season begins. Clear away other debris that is likely to fly during a storm.
Retrofit your home’s roof, windows, and doors to protect it better. For example, you can have impact resistant windows, reinforced doors, and hurricane shutters installed ahead of time to guard against storm damage.You can also have a contractor secure your roof to the house frame using metal hurricane clips, braces, or straps.

, Take further steps if you know that a hurricane is on the way. Even if you’ve retrofitted your house, there are measures you can take to strengthen it before the storm breaks.If you have storm shutters, close them. Otherwise, board up or tape your windows. Plywood works best, and use alligator tape instead of duct tape.
Secure loose rain gutters and downspouts and clear them of debris or clogs. Turn off all propane tanks, as well.
Check that your garage doors are secured. Do not leave them open and board up any gaps between the door and ground: flying garages can destroy your home.

, When the power goes out, your refrigerator will stop working and any meat, dairy, or perishable foods will spoil. Your water may also get cut off. To give yourself the best shot at survival, keep a well-stocked pantry of canned and non-perishable food and bottled water – at least a three day supply.Fill bottles with fresh drinking water and store them in your shelter. You will need about one gallon of water per day, per person, and more for cooking and washing. Mark your calendar to ensure that drinking water is regularly updated.
Keep at least a three-day supply of food that will not spoil. This means food that is canned, tinned, or freeze dried. Make provisions for pet food, too.
During the threat stage, disinfect your bathtub and other large jugs and fill them with water. These sources might be vital post-storm for drinking, bathing, and toilet flushing., Head north to avoid the storm if you can, where it will have lost strength by the time it reaches you. For example, go to Georgia if you live in southern Florida or move inland if you live in the Carolinas. It's a lot easier to keep the family and pets together and safe when you are away rather than weathering the storm.Stay together. Leave your home in a group and take one car if possible.
Always obey local orders to evacuate. Evacuation should be an added priority if you live in a mobile home, even one made after 1994. Mobile homes can be destroyed in the weakest, Category 1 hurricanes.
Only take what you really need, like your cell phone, meds, identification, cash, and perhaps some clothes. Have an emergency medical kit with you, as well.
Fill up the gas tank and give yourself plenty of time. You do not want to be in your car during a hurricane.
Never leave pets behind––if they're not able to escape debris, flood waters, or flying items, they can be injured or killed.

, If you decide to stay, you’ll need to find a place that will protect you, your family, and your pets during the storm. This shelter should not have any windows or skylights. If it's in your home, close all interior doors and secure and brace the external doors.Hopefully you will have prepared as mentioned above. In that case, you should have a safe space and everything you need.
If not, make do in the time available. Choose an interior room with strong walls and no windows. An interior bathroom or closet can work, for example. You can even protect yourself in a ceramic bathtub, covering the top with plywood.
Alternatively, look for a community shelter. Hurricane areas like Florida have shelters statewide that open during storms. Find one near you, bringing things like meds, insurance papers, IDs, bedding, flashlights, basic snacks, and games.

, Don’t cut it close. Get to your shelter before the storm starts. Bring a battery-powered radio and a supply of batteries and use it for updates (every 15 to 30 minutes). At this point, the outer bands of the hurricane should have already started to affect you.Have your Emergency Disaster Supply Kit close at hand.
Stay inside at all times, even if it seems calm. The weather in a hurricane can moderate and worsen quickly, especially if you are passing through the eye of the storm.
Keep away from windows, skylights, and glass doors. The biggest risk in a hurricane is from flying debris or broken glass.
For added protection, try to lie on the floor under something sturdy like a table.
Water and lightning pose electrocution risks during a hurricane. Turn off your main breaker and big appliances if you lose power or are threatened with flood water. Try not to use electric appliances, the phone, or the shower., A lot can happen in a serious hurricane. You might be in danger from the storm surge, injured by debris, or face some other medical crisis. What should you do if something happens?


Unless you’re threatened by flood waters, it’s probably best to stay inside and sheltered. The high winds and flying debris can injure or even kill you.
Try to call 911 if you or your family are in life-threatening danger.But keep in mind that the phone may not work and emergency services may not be available. Thousands of 911 calls went unanswered during Hurricane Katrina, for example.Use the resources you have. Treat injuries as best you can with a first aid kit. If you can reach 911, they may at least be able to advise you on a course of action.

, Don't leave your shelter until you get the official “all-clear” from the NOAA. If the winds die down it may only be the dangerous eye of the storm, which will be followed by the back side of the “eye wall” and high winds. A hurricane can take hours to pass.


The area around the eye of the storm is where wind speeds are strongest. It can also spawn tornadoes.Wait at least 30 minutes after the eye of the storm has passed before entering rooms with windows. Even then, you should be very careful––at this point, there is still a good chance of debris breaking glass.
Be careful even after the all-clear. There will be lots of hazards like downed trees, wires, and power lines. Do not go near any of these lines or wires. Call the power company or emergency services to help you, instead.
Stay away from flooded areas, as well. Use extreme caution if you have to enter a flooded area, as there may be hidden debris or other hazards.

, The hurricane’s high winds will damage many, if not most, structures. Do not enter any buildings after the storm unless you're sure they're structurally safe. Also, evacuate as fast as you safely can if a building shows signs of severe damage, in case it collapses.Stay away if you smell gas, see flood waters, or if the building has been damaged by fire.
Use a flashlight rather than candles, matches, torches, or lanterns. There may be a gas leak and you could cause a fire or explosion. Open windows and doors to let any such gas escape.
Do not try to turn on the electricity unless you are ABSOLUTELY sure it’s safe. Check all electric and gas connections before turning them on.
Be mindful of loose or slippery floorboards, falling debris, and cracked masonry when entering a structure.

, Your first priority during a hurricane is to stay safe and keep your family and pets healthy. Only after this is done should you start to take stock. Check your house for structural damage. If anything is of concern, get the authorities to check it out as quickly as possible and don't go near the area until it has been fixed.Clean and disinfect everything that might have come into contact with sewage, bacteria, or spilled chemicals. Throw out all spoiled food, as well. When in doubt, throw it out.Get your water system running and safe. Have damaged septic systems repaired, for example, and get your wells checked for chemical contamination.
Start to remove and replace wet drywall and other panelling that can harbor mould.

, You should never enter a flooded basement – apart from the risk of electrocution, flood waters can hide debris or harbor bacteria from things like raw sewage.Instead, use a pump to gradually reduce the water level by about one third each day until it's gone.


Plug a shop vac into a safe outlet upstairs and begin pumping down the water. Keep the cord clear of the water and wear rubber boots for safety. If you have a heavy-duty gas pump, feed the hose into the basement through a window.
If you can’t drain the basement safely, call the fire department and ask them to do it for you.

, You may be able to recoup some of the losses to your home and property if you have an insurance policy that covers flood, wind, and storm damage. Get in touch with your provider as soon as you can to file a report.Start a list of damages for your claims. Take photos and videos, keep receipts for repairs, supplies, and even hotel costs.
If you have to vacate the home, make sure your insurance company know where to reach you. Try contacting them by phone. Many providers have toll-free, 24 hour 1-800 numbers.
In a total loss, some people even paint their address and insurance provider’s name on the house to attract the attention of an insurance adjuster.Try within reason to prevent further damage. Cover a damaged roof with a tarp, for example, and cover openings with plywood, plastic, or other materials.

Choose a light base layer.,
Wear fleece over the base layer.,
Find a breathable outer coat.,
Pick long pants or tights.,
Select reflective gear.",How to Choose Cold Weather Fitness Clothing1," The layer closest to your skin should be a moisture-wicking material that will keep you dry as you sweat. It should also be form fitting to help insulate your body. Avoid cotton, as it can become damp from your sweat. Instead, look for shirts that are made of:


Wool
Polyester
Wool/Polyester mixPolypropylene;
, The middle layer can be a pullover sweater, a front-zipping jacket, or a vest. It should be warm and insulating while still allowing your body to breathe. Fleece is a good middle layer as it is warm and soft like wool but much lighter.If you live in an area that is extremely cold, you may decide to wear wool. Be aware that it is much heavier, and it may be more burdensome as you exercise.

, The outermost layer should be a waterproof coat. You may want to look for one that has zipper vents, which you can open to air out your armpits. Unless you live in an extremely cold area, you may only need a light shell or a raincoat for this layer.Some good materials for the outer layer include:


Nylon
Gore-Tex
event

, You should not wear shorts during the wintertime. Although you can warm up through exercise, it may not be sufficient to prevent cold related conditions like hypothermia. Wear long pants, leggings, exercise tights, or yoga pants when exercising outside.


If it is dry outside, you might choose a polyester blend or cotton for your pants.
If it is wet or snowy, you might opt for a waterproof bottom.
If you run, you may want to look for thermal running tights.

, As it can get dark early in winter, you want to make sure that you are visible to motorists as you exercise. When buying fitness clothing, look for outer layers that have reflective coloring, such as metallic orange or silver.If you cannot find reflective winter clothing, you can also look for clip-on LED lights or reflective arm bands, belts, and shoe clips.

Buy a hat or headband.,
Layer your gloves.,
Find a helmet for winter sports.,
Search for a ski mask.",How to Choose Cold Weather Fitness Clothing2," Headgear can keep your ears and head warm as you exercise outside. When looking for good hats and headbands, find a material that is thick and insulated. Both hats and headbands should pull over and cover your ears.If you get a knit hat, make sure that it is lined on the inside.

, Try finding thin glove liners that you can wear under thicker gloves. When your hands get too warm, take off the heavier gloves, and just wear the glove liners.Glove liners are often made out of thin, insulating materials. Some may be made out of natural materials, like wool, while others made be a mix of synthetic materials, like Thermasilk, spandex, and nylon.
Your outer gloves can be something heavier, such as knitted wool. You can even wear fingerless hand warmers over the glove liners if that is more comfortable.

, If you are skiing, snowboarding, or biking, make sure that you have adequate head protection. A good helmet will prevent injury in case you slip or fall.A good helmet will be snug but not too tight. Be sure to try on helmets before purchasing. If you will wear the helmet with goggles, bring the goggles to try on with it.
Look for a helmet that has an insulated layer on the inside and a hard outer casing. This lining should cover your ears to protect them from cold wind.
Some winter helmets will have vents or adjustable plugs to prevent your scalp from sweating., Ski masks—also known a face liners or balaclavas-- provide extra protection against extremely low temperatures. These resemble hoods that pull over your head. They will often cover your mouth, chin, and forehead against strong wind and cold temperatures. In addition to skiing and snowboarding, ski masks may be useful for those hiking or biking at high altitudes.

Seek out thermal socks.,
Go up a size.,
Look for good traction.,
Consider waterproof shoes.",How to Choose Cold Weather Fitness Clothing3," If your feet get cold while exercising, you may want to find warmer socks. Thermal socks are a great choice as they keep your feet warm and dry through all types of cold weather.


Thermal socks tend to be made out of wool. If you have a wool sensitivity, look for a pair made out of synthetic materials.If you decide to wear thinner socks, you can layer an extra pair over the first pair for the same effect. This may be uncomfortable for running.

, Thermal socks are extremely thick, and you may find that your foot is cramped inside your normal exercise shoe. You may want to find a winter shoe that is one half size to one full size larger than your normal shoe. When shopping for shoes, try wearing a pair of thermal socks to see how they fit in the shoe., If you live somewhere where there is snow and ice, you will need to find a shoe with good traction. This may help prevent falls during cold weather. When looking for a winter shoe, check the bottom to see what type of traction there is.A good shoe for snow or ice will have traction on the bottom of the shoe that resembles studs or cleats.
If you enjoy hiking in high, snowy altitudes, you may want to look for snow cleats or crampons.

, If snow and ice are an issue for you, you may want to find a shoe that is waterproof. A waterproof shoe is generally more expensive. The material is heavier and less flexible, but it can keep your feet warm and dry in snowy conditions. Water can still enter the shoe through the sock.If you do not have much snow or rain in your area, you may not need a waterproof shoe.

Treat the victim for shock.",How to Protect Yourself in a Thunderstorm," If you find yourself caught in a lightning storm, the key to minimizing danger is to get inside a protective structure. While most people seek shelter if lightning appears to be near, people commonly wait too long to seek shelter. If you can detect lightning, it may be close enough to strike you. Don’t wait for it to strike right next to you (or on top of you) to get to safety. Never stand under a tall or short tree, and avoid being close to power lines as they're both excellent conductors of electricity and could potentially cause death, if not serious injury. Find shelter near or under a stony shelter such as a cavern. Substantial, frequently inhabited buildings (those grounded with plumbing, electrical systems, and, if possible, lightning rods) are best.
If you can’t find a substantial structure, get in a car with a metal roof and sides. If the car is struck, the metal body will conduct the electricity around you, not through you. Make sure all windows are rolled up and doors are closed. Be careful not to lean against any metal -- if you do, the lightning will be conducted into your body if it strikes the car. Do not use the radio.
Avoid small structures, such as stand-alone public restrooms. Open covering and rain shelters are also not suitable. These structures will attract lightning and provide no protection, making them more dangerous to be around.
Standing under a tree is a very bad choice. Lightning strikes tall objects, and if the tree you are standing under is struck, you may be struck as well or injured by the tree.
Bring in your pets. Doghouses and other pet shelters are not suitable protection against lightning strikes. A pet leashed to a fence has a much higher risk of getting struck by lightning.;
, Keep windows closed, and try to stay within inner rooms of the structure. Windows provide a direct path for the lightning to travel.

, Using a landline phone is the main cause of lightning-related injuries in the US. Lightning can travel into the home from through any material that conducts electricity. This includes landlines, electrical wiring, and plumbing.


Do not touch any electrical outlets during a storm. Do not unplug any devices during a lightning storm, as the strike could be transferred to you.
Do not lie on concrete floors or lean against concrete walls. Most concrete has a wire mesh which can conduct electricity
Stay out of the bathtub or shower, and avoid indoor swimming pools.
In a car, try to avoid touching any part of the metal frame or the car's glass.

, Stay inside at least 30 minutes after the last strike. Don’t go out just because the rain is starting to let up. There is still a significant risk of lightning strikes from a departing storm.

, If you absolutely cannot reach shelter during a lightning storm, do everything you can to minimize your risk.


Move to a lower elevation. Lightning is much more likely to strike objects at higher elevations. Do what you can do get as low as possible.
Avoid large open spaces where you are taller than anything else around you, like a golf course or soccer field.
Stay away from isolated objects such as trees and light posts.
Get away from unprotected vehicles, such as golf carts, and unprotected structures, such as picnic shelters. Avoid long metal structures, i.e. bleachers.

, If you are fishing or swimming, get out of the water immediately, and move away from the body of water. Being near water is extremely dangerous during a lightning storm.

, If you are caught in a lightning storm with a group of people, maintain a distance of at least 50–100 feet (15.2–30.5 m) between each person. This will reduce the risk of lightning traveling from one person to another.


Take a headcount after every close strike. This will ensure that anyone struck will get emergency attention quickly.

, If you are hiking with a metal frame backpack, remove it as soon as you detect lightning. Make sure to leave it at least 100 feet (30.5 m) from wherever you are taking shelter., Squat down with your feet together, your head tucked to your chest or between your knees, and your hands covering your ears or flat against your knees. Do not lie flat on the ground, as this gives the lightning a larger target.


This is a difficult position to hold and it by no means guarantees your safety. However, by making it easier for a lightning strike to flow over your body rather than through vital organs, you may be able to sustain a smaller injury from it.
Cover your ears and close your eyes to protect against nearby thunder and bright lightning flashes.

, If lightning is about to strike you or strike near you, your hair may stand on end, or you may feel a tingling in your skin. Light metal objects may vibrate, and you may hear a crackling sound or ""kee kee"" sound. If you detect any of these signals, assume the lightning crouch immediately.

, They are made of a material which is a bad electrical conductor.

, The best way to avoid injury from a lightning storm is to avoid it completely. Make your plans with dangerous weather in mind. Listen to the local weather forecast, and pay special attention to thunderstorm advisories.


Research the local climate: in some areas you can almost guarantee a thunderstorm on summer afternoons. Schedule your activities to avoid many high-risk situations. Those hot, muggy days are just the thing that a thunderstorm needs to get going., When you’re out and about, watch the sky for signs of approaching thunderstorms, such as rain, darkening skies, or towering cumulonimbus clouds. If you can anticipate lightning before the first strike, you can avoid being caught in a bad situation.


Note that lightning can, however, strike even in the absence of these indicators.

, If conditions permit good visibility, and it’s not practical to seek shelter whenever you notice a strike, use the 30 second rule: if the time between a lightning flash and the resulting thunder is 30 seconds or less (aka 6 miles (9.7 km) or less), get to shelter immediately.

, If you are in an area that you expect will see lightning storms, know where safe shelters are. Communicate your plans to your group so that everyone knows what to do in an emergency.

, Be ready with first aid and other disaster essentials. You may lose power during a thunderstorm, so have alternative light sources available.

, If you live in a lightning-prone area, installing a lightning rod can help protect your family and your property.


Have your lightning rod professionally installed. An incorrectly installed rod can increase the chance of a lightning strike.

, Because lightning strikes can cause cardiac arrest, aggressive resuscitation may be necessary. If you cannot dial 9-1-1, designate someone else to.

, Do not put yourself in danger trying to help a lightning strike victim. Either wait until the immediate danger has passed, or move the victim to a safer location.


Despite the common myth, lightning can strike the same place twice.

, People struck by lightning do not retain an electrical charge, so you can immediately touch them and begin treatment. Do not remove the burned clothes unless absolutely necessary.



Perform Child CPR if the victim is a child.

Perform Adult CPR on adult victims.

, Lay the victim down on his or her back with the head resting slightly lower than the torso. Elevate and support the legs."

Remove dead trees and brush.",How to Prepare for a Hurricane," Once you hear about it, chances are you have several days to finalize your plans. Avoid letting your guard down or taking things too leniently, however, as hurricanes have been known to pick up speed or shift course unexpectedly.;
, Canned food is the only kind acceptable for an event such as a hurricane; again, make sure the food is fresh.


Cook all raw meats in your refrigerator and freeze them. They will help keep the other food cold and you can take them out one at a time for meals that do not require cooking.
Try getting canned food that doesn't require any added water or milk, such as Progresso.
If you decide to stay at home, fill up the bathtub. An average bathtub full of water holds enough water for about three days. It also makes it possible to flush the toilet using a bucket.
There is much water in the hot water heater of your home. An average 150 liter water heater has enough water to keep a single person alive for a month. See here for details.
An average person needs about 3.5 l of water (one gallon) per day. Pets (dogs) need about 1.75L of water per day. Cats need much less water.
Make sure that you have a BBQ and lots of charcoal or propane so that you can cook and heat foods for meals. Small propane bottles can also serve as heat and light sources.
Put all the ice that you have in your freezer into plastic bags. Fill all spaces in your freezer with bags of ice. Freeze water bottles, too.

, Eat perishables first in anticipation of the power going out. Fill your fridge and freezer with bottled water and sealed non-perishable items. The more full your freezer is, the more items there are to retain the cold and keep the overall temperature down. The same applies to the refrigerator.

Store as much water and fluids as you can in your fridge so that if the power goes out, it will retain the cold longer; hopefully in time for the power to turn back on.
See How to keep foods frozen during a power failure for more details.

, This can be a daunting task as some insurers will not honor refills until the last refill is nearly used up or has run out. If necessary, drugs must be purchased without insurance; weeks may go by without the ability to get refills, putting your health (or even your life) at risk.

, This should further insure that they stay dry in case of flooding.

, How often you watch the Weather Channel is up to you, but if you start to feel overwhelmed or panicky, turn it off. You can always turn the news back on when you feel better.


Ask a trusted neighbor to let you know when a hurricane will likely head your way so you can be informed when news watching is absolutely vital. It may be a good idea to evacuate your area beforehand, since traffic will be a problem during a mandatory evacuation order.

, It's best to get out of town before it becomes mandatory, or even recommended. If you wait until the last minute, an hour will have passed before you get out of your driveway.


You should evacuate if...

You live in a mobile home or RV. They are unsafe even in a Category 1 storm
You live in a high-rise building. Winds are stronger at higher altitudes, and this will cause the building to sway.
You live near an area prone to storm surge. Check that the house will not flood by storm surge and/or waves.




Inform your family and friends about your decision. They will rest easier if they know what you plan to do and why.

, If you don't have a car, don't be too proud to ask others for help. If you do, leaving at an off-hour such as 2am is the best way to assure minimal traffic.

, For example, if you live in Florida or Louisiana and the hurricane is said to be heading northwest, you'll want to have a route that heads northeast or north, whichever one is safer and shorter.


Contact any friends or family that you may need to stay with during this time. Let them know that you are coming.

, Stock it not only with necessities such as food (which should be in your Hurricane Preparedness Kit) clothing and medicine, but photos and important papers such as birth certificates and shot records leaving (don't forget about your pets' shot records!), pack things that you would not want to be without both for your time away from home and in the event all is lost.


A good rule of thumb is to plan about a week's worth of away-time (don't forget the laundry soap, etc. just in case it's longer). Choose carefully. You presumably have a limited amount of space in your vehicle and space for humans is needed too.
Make sure you have spare oil and consider taking an extra gas tank if you can safely carry one on or in your vehicle (gas stations on evacuation routes sometimes run out of gas).

, (For steps on protecting the home, see below).

, If you will be staying with friends, family, or in a hotel (don't count on it, have a back up plan even if you've made reservations ahead of time) withdraw sufficient cash for two weeks.


ATMs and banks may not be operating in the aftermath of a major hurricane and some credit card machines will be down.
If you expect to be displaced, a family of four needs approximately $500 to last a week if you'll be staying in hotels. You'll need less than that if you will be staying with friends, relatives or in a shelter.

, You can charge them up with the power from your car if you have a DC to AC converter.

, Around small children, make the hurricane preparation/evacuation into an unexpected vacation or adventure.

, Make sure that everything is in order, to the best of your ability, before you leave.


Is the power, gas, and water turned off?
Do you have everything you need? Did you bring all your pets along?
Is the first driver well-rested or would another couple of hours of rest do him or her a world of good? Leaving at 4am instead of 2am if you need to will still keep you out of the main flow of traffic, so there's no need to rush since any driver needs to stay on top of things especially during an evacuation.

, Before you decide you will not evacuate, accept full responsibility for that decision. Many times people disobey warning signs or evacuation orders thinking that if something bad happens they will be rescued.


In addition to folks winning the Darwin Award this way, emergency services personnel (a ""scarce resource"" during a disaster) are put unnecessarily into harm's way. Many potential rescuers have died or been injured in their attempts to rescue people. It is much safer to prepare and follow warnings.
If you are told to evacuate and decide not to do it, acknowledge your responsibility for your decision, and do not expect to be rescued later.

, It is not only your stuff you are protecting but yourself and your family who have stayed behind.


If you have removable hurricane shutters, try to put them up at least two days before landfall. Holding a 25-pound aluminum shutter while balancing on a ladder in 74 mph winds is no fun and can lead to bad things. If you are using plywood, get your wood and nails early.
There is a slight risk of less-than-ideal folks wandering around the neighborhood possibly looking for an empty home to rob. Lock all doors and windows, place heavy, opaque drapes in front of windows to prevent outside eyes from looking in, and if you have them and if you live in the US, load up on several rounds of ammunition for your rifles, shotguns, handguns, and pistols prior to the hurricane's arrival. Advertise that there are weapons in the vicinity. Don't try this in Canada though -- you'll get arrested.

, Do not sink any furniture into a swimming pool, this is an old myth and a very bad idea.

, See ""Things You'll Need"" below., The ""safe room"" should have no windows or exterior doors and preferably only one interior door.


Bring in a mattress to lean upright against the door and pre-stock it with a radio, batteries, flashlight and enough food, water and pre-moistened napkins to last 12 hours. Make sure all household members know that they are to run to this room once the wind starts rushing into the home. All pets, if you have them, must go here too during the hurricane. Keep any equipment your pet may need, i.e. water or cat litter, in this room too. If you think you might have difficulty getting your pet(s) into this room if it becomes necessary, have treats or toys on hand to entice them.
If the hurricane is only Category 2 or lower, you will not likely need to go into a ""safe room"" in the center of your house. However it is a wise idea to keep away from large windows or board them up just the same. Note that for buildings made from steel and/or reinforced concrete may survive stronger hurricanes than wooden buildings.

, If the power has gone out, listen for wind and rain that will steadily increase as the hurricane nears.

, This is to assure they are not accidentally left lit when and if the winds start whipping through your home.


A safe way to use candles is to put them in a saucepan, deeper than the candle is high, with shiny sides. The light will reflect off the ceiling and inside of the pot, and the candle will be protected from being knocked over. An inch or so of water in the pot isn't a bad idea, either.
However, if you smell gas, hear gas, or even suspect a gas leak, do not use candles. Use light sticks.

, Often, the major radio stations will have special coverage in the local programs if a hurricane is coming.

, Inflate air beds to ensure they don't need patching or replacing. Check expiration dates on canned foods. Use a battery tester so you know they will work when you need them to (most batteries have a tester already attached to the package, but you can buy one separately if you want to).

, The water in a hot water tank can keep one person alive and healthy for more than a month.


Attach a garden hose to the drain valve. Run water out of the tank to remove any built up sediment that has collected at the bottom of the tank.
To get the water out of the tank after a storm you will need to open the plumbing system by opening any hot water faucet in the house. This will release the vacuum in the tank. You must turn off the electrical breaker to the hot water tank or unplug it to prevent damage if the electricity is restored before water service.

, Generally, a generator should be big enough to run your refrigerator, a lamp or two, any fans, and any special durable medical equipment needed by a member of your family. If your family does have special health or medical needs, or you absolutely must have air conditioning, be prepared to pay handsomely for a generator that can handle it. The best option in this latter case is to have the generator wired into your home power so the generator will start when the power goes out. Taking this precaution is even more important if only one person in the home knows how, or is strong enough, to start the generator. Search the web for generator wattage calculators to make sure you don't buy more generator than you need - your wallet will thank you at the gas pump.


Purchase several 5-gallon gas cans. Fuel is usually scarce after a hurricane, and many stations even limit the amount of gas you can purchase after waiting in line. Having multiple cans will allow you to stock up. Buy a bottle of fuel stabilizer for when the power is restored. Mix this with your gas so that it will keep until you are able to use it. Also, fill and run your generator with the mixture for about 10 minutes so that the fuel system does not gum up while in storage. Change the oil and/or filter before you store it, that way it's nice and fresh next season.
If you already have a generator, make sure it is in working order before hurricane season. There is nothing worse than finding out that your generator investment needs repairs after you need to use it.
If you are unable to purchase a generator, buy a DC to AC converter for your car. With it you will use your car as a portable electric generator. They cost $25 to $100 and are available in the automotive section of department stores. If you should lose power to your house, you will be able run a radio, TV, light, refrigerator, or other low wattage appliances from your car. You will need a heavy duty extension cord to run the power into your house.
Do not run the car or any gasoline generator in the garage as the carbon monoxide poisoning could kill you.

, If a large tree falls onto your house, it can punch a big hole in the roof. If a large tree falls onto your car, it can easily be crushed flat. Spindly evergreens are especially likely to fall in the event of a hurricane.

, When is the last time you changed the oil or the filter? Is the battery fully charged? Have you replaced the spare that you had to use the last time you evacuated? Since hurricane season happens during the warmer months, make sure your coolant is topped off as well.

, After a big storm hits there may not be any gasoline available for days or even weeks because of power outages and the gas pumps not working.


If your neighborhood is destroyed you will be able to go for supplies or even ride out of the area. Make certain that the bike tires are pumped up before a storm hits.
Have an inner tube patch kit and an air pump or air compressor that runs off the battery of your car handy, as well.

, This will help you create a plan of action.

, They will gain comfort just knowing where you are, how you are faring, and how close the storm is to you. If you are in an area that is on the outskirts of the storm, tell them. Assure them that you are all doing good.


Remember, they only know what they are told on the TV and their imagination runs wild. If you lose your telephone power, call them at least once with your cell phone, to tell them you do not have phone service, and that you will call as soon as it is restored. This way you do not have to use up your cell phone minutes which should be saved for emergencies.

, This assures that you will lessen the amount of things you'll have to do when the time comes. Remember simple things like food, medication and water.

, The take box should have everything you need to reconstruct your life in the event you evacuate and everything is lost. Passports; birth, wedding, adoption, divorce, and armed service separation certificates; copies of insurance policies; mortgage information; house and car title; large purchase receipts, etc.


If you have a scanner, save yourself space and heartbreak by scanning family albums and images of other keepsakes, burn those to CD and keep a copy in your take box, or make a copy of all your pictures, videos, music and documents on an external hard drive that you can keep in your take box.
Remember that CDs can malfunction. Make sure you take along the original documents, if possible, make copies of them. The CD is just for convenience when shown to officials.
Be sure to take all documentation and identification related to anyone's military service, if applicable.
If anyone in the household owns or carries firearms (US), make sure that you have all the appropriate permits and documentation stored in the take box.

, One of the most important lessons from hurricane Katrina to make sure everyone in the family knows who to contact (and how to contact them) as an out of area contact.


Make sure kids know enough information so that an adult can get in touch with that person should sudden evacuation be necessary when you aren't near them. Practice this, and make other back up plans. If you have young children, you might like to write important contact information on an index card and give it to them in case they are somehow separated from you. If your older children have cell phones, make sure that your contact information and any other important contact information are programmed into their contact list/speed dials.
This can be as involved as you like, but keep in mind the ages and temperaments of individuals to assure everything runs smoothly in the event you have to evacuate immediately. See Tips below for examples on how to do a run-through.

, If you're not sure, speak with the gas or electric company for instructions. You don't want to be running around at the last minute trying to figure out how to do these things.

, Hurricane season is not the time to buy flood insurance since it's either unavailable or outrageously expensive. Note: most regular home insurance does not include flood coverage in the policy, so you'll have to buy this separately.

, Keep in touch with friends and family that are out of the potential disaster area, and make arrangements to stay with them, in case you have to evacuate.

, Have an arborist remove dead trees and dead tree limbs and evaluate the health of any trees near enough to fall on your (or your neighbor's) house.

Take advantage of your vehicle’s space.,
Be prepared for emergencies.,
Bring along some food and water.,
Pack clothing and accessories appropriately.",How to Camp in Your Car1," No matter what you drive, you’ll want to get the most of its storage potential. Clear anything you don’t need out of the seats and floorboards and fill every available nook and cranny with important equipment. And, of course, use your trunk space. The more you’re able to bring along, the less likely you are to run into trouble and discomfort.


Do a little planning ahead before you start loading up your car. Every item you pack should have a specific purpose.Use roof racks to hold as much gear as you can so you’ll have more room inside the cabin.;
, Depending on your location, you may not have the luxury of stopping into a supermarket or department store for a supply run. Fill a backpack or duffel bag with items like a flashlight, batteries, road flares, duct tape, jumper cables, a first aid kit, spending cash and reserve water and rations. Know where you emergency bag is at all times and always take inventory before you set off for your next checkpoint.Some other tools worth making room for include a utility knife, binoculars, bungee cords, chemical hand warmers, a flint for starting fires and a map of major interstate and highway routes.Keep your cell phone charged and protected from the elements in case you need to place an urgent call.
Don't forget basic hygiene necessities, like a toothbrush and toothpaste, mouthwash, antibacterial soap, deodorant and toilet paper.

, It’s not necessary to prepare and eat every meal out of your car, but it won’t hurt to have a camp stove or some Sterno with you to heat up something if you’re far from civilization, get in a jam or don’t have time to stop. Stow some bottled water and non-perishable food items in your car, or at the very least load a cooler with granola bars and canned drinks in case you need a quick pick-me-up.For longer trips, stock up on more food than you think you’ll realistically need to be on the safe side.
What you save on accommodations, you can spend on an occasional hot meal.

, Know what the weather is like where you’re headed and at any necessary stops along the way. If you’re camping or passing through somewhere cold, wear a warm jacket and be sure to pack lots of layers. If you’re destined for someplace with a hotter climate, you’d be wise to include a few pairs of shorts or some tank tops. Bring a few changes of clothes to replace garments that get wet, damaged or dirty.Select your accessories to match your needs. For instance, you’ll want to have a pair of warm, waterproof boots, a hat, scarf and gloves in the winter, sunscreen and bug spray in the summer, a slicker for rain, etc.
Avoid the temptation to overpack clothes. You probably won’t end up wearing most of them on shorter trips."

Having friends to play with can make you happier,but camping alone can also be a blast. Try to think of people that you would want to hang out with all night, and then give them a call to see if they can sleep over.


Make sure to ask your parents if it’s okay for you to invite people over for indoor camping.
Ask your siblings if they want to camp.
Only invite people that will get along with each other. Camping is about having fun, and arguing ruins that.
If you have your friend’s phone number, call or text them and give them an invitation to camping. If you don’t have their phone number, you can ask if they want to come camping at school or when you see them in person.;
, Your campers are going to be hungry and thirsty, so you’ll need to prepare snacks and some drinks for when they get there. Hot chocolate in a thermos is a great way to make it feel like you’re camping outdoors. There are also snacks that you can prepare beforehand like ""ants on a log,"" so that when your friends get there they are already made.


To make ""ants on a log,"" cut a celery stick so you have a 4 inch piece. Fill the inside with peanut butter, then add raisins on top of the peanut butter.Repeat this until you have enough ""ants on a log"" for everyone to eat.
You can also replace your snacks.
You can buy fruit punch concentrate or powder at the store and then add water in a large pitcher to provide enough for everyone there.

, Even though it may not be as hard as locating a campsite in the wilderness, it’s still important to find a place in your house that’s big enough for camping. You want a wide open space so your friends have the ability to spread out and enjoy themselves. You also need enough room to set up a tent and to have enough space for all of the sleeping bags. A good place to have your indoor campsite would be in the living room, finished basement, or your own bedroom.


If you are camping out in a room with a TV, put a sheet over the television so that no one is tempted to turn it on. You can watch TV any day, this is supposed to be camping!
Ask a parent or guardian to help you move furniture out of the way if there is not enough room at your campsite to fit everything.

, Think of some creative things you can do while you camp that don't use the TV or computer. Treasure hunts, card games, reading books out loud, or telling stories are all really fun things you can do that don't require any electricity. Make sure to set things up beforehand, and put your cards and other games in a place where you can find them. Write down some of your planned activities so that if you get bored through out the night, you have something to do.


If you are camping out with friends or family, go over the list with them to see if they have anything they want to add.
You don't have to stick to the list, but it's a good idea to have some ideas handy if people are getting bored.

, If you have an outdoor tent and a big enough space, you can set your tent up on your campsite. Be sure to ask your parents for help when setting up an outdoor tent. If you don’t have an outdoor tent, you can make a tent using a large sheet and chairs or a sofa. Get creative and figure out different ways to make your tent more sturdy!


To make a tent out of sheets and four chairs, arrange your four heavy chairs in a square and place a large bed sheet over them. Place a heavy object, like 2-4 books, over the sheet and on the seat of the chair to prevent the tent from slipping. Add pillows underneath and you've made a makeshift indoor tent.
If you don’t own a large enough sheet, you can connect smaller sheets with bobby pins to make a larger sheet for the tent.

, Even though you’ll be inside, you can still get the spooky feeling of camping outdoors. Turn out all the lights and use flashlights to replicate the feeling of being outside. Using smaller hand-held flashlights are the best because they aren't too bright but still illuminate the area. Make sure that the batteries in your flashlights still have power.


Get replacement batteries in case they die while you're camping.
This is especially useful when telling scary stories!
If there is a parent around, lighting a couple of candles can replace flashlights.

, To really get the feeling of camping, you should be going to sleep in a sleeping bag, just like you would do outdoors. Unroll and unzip the sleeping bag and make sure that there is enough room for everyone to lay down when you go to sleep.


If you don’t have any sleeping bags, you can make some with a large pillowy comforter. To do this, just lay down the comforter on the ground and roll it three times on the long end, so it forms a tube. Fold the bottom part of the blanket down, under your feet, and you can sleep inside, just like you would in a sleeping bag.
Use a lot of pillows to make it more comfortable since you’ll be sleeping on the floor.

, To make it feel like your camping outdoors, you can put up glow in the dark stars on your ceiling or create a campfire out of multicolored tissue paper, construction paper, and a portable light. To make a fake campfire, create the logs with the construction paper by rolling them up into tubes, or you can use paper towel or toilet tissue rolls as an easy alternative. Tape them to the outside of your light-source, then tape red, yellow, and orange tissue paper to the rolls. This will look like a real fire, and create the intended effect!


The best light source to use is a low wattage, round, portable light you can pick up at a department store.
Make sure that the light-bulb you use for the light source does not get hot and is not a high wattage. Check with your parent's first so you can avoid causing a real fire!
If your house has gas fireplace, ask your parents if they can turn it on.
Getting a candle with the camp fire scent to replicate the smell of a fire with help you create a better ambiance.

, S’mores are classic snacks during camping trips, and though you don’t have an open campfire, you can still make s'mores in the microwave.


Get a piece of chocolate, a marshmallow, and two graham crackers. Stack them into a sandwich with the graham crackers on the top and bottom. Place on a microwavable plate and microwave for only 5-7 seconds.You don’t need to keep it in the microwave for a long time!
Make sure you get enough ingredients so that everyone camping can eat at least one s’more.

, A fun thing to do while you are camping out indoors is to tell spooky stories to one another. Telling stories to one another is good for social relationships, engage our brain, and trigger our imagination.If you don’t know of any scary stories, try looking online, just make sure that there is a parent with you when you are doing it.


You can also ask your parents to take you to a bookstore to find a book with scary stories in them.
Make sure to not make anyone feel uncomfortable. If someone is really scared, you can turn the lights back on and play a game instead.
You can read comic books as an alternative to scary stories.

, Plan out the games and activities you plan on doing beforehand. Since you’re inside you can now play a bunch of different types of board games. You can also play games that don't require any pieces like never have I ever, truth or dare, or hide and seek.


You should try to limit the amount that you use technology since this is camping, but if you want, you can look up spooky videos online with parental supervision.
Try to not watch TV or a movie or else it will be just like any other night.

, The main point of camping is to have fun, so make sure that you’re laughing and enjoying your friends’ company. Always try to keep the mood lighthearted and make sure that everyone you invite is also having a great time.


Laughing makes us feel better, and can improve social relationships.If the mood is too serious, lighten it up by telling a joke or challenge a friend to a game.
You can find jokes online, just make sure they are appropriate and not offensive.

Seek an evacuation center, if necessary.,
Stay alert.Make sure that the storm has cleared out of you way before return home or leaving your house to assess damage.,
Safely clean up what you can.Once it is safe to return home or come out, begin cleaning up what you can.,
If you have been fortunate, help others.",How to Prepare For a Tornado," Make sure everyone in the family knows where to go, what to take, and how to be safe if a tornado hits.

Store important documents, just in case.Make copies of birth certificates, insurance information, and social security cards to bring with you if you need to evacuate. This will be valuable if you aren't able to return home immediately after the tornado.

Set up means of communication.Make sure everyone in the family knows how to get in contact with everyone else. School number, work number, and cell phone numbers should be compiled on a list. Anyone, such as a babysitter, that your children might be with during the emergency should be included on this list. Keep it with the copies of your important documents. Know who will be in charge of having these forms, if evacuation is necessary.

Know the closest evacuation center. If you may be in the danger zone, it's important to know where the safest place to be is. In most cases, schools, the community center, and city building are used. These places will have medical attention and supplies. This can also be used as a meet up place for your family after the storm.;
,



Create an emergency kit.This should include water and food for at least 72 hours. Having a means of communication or information (radio, satellite phone, etc.) is also important to include. Any first aid supplies, clothes, and toiletries that you may need should be stored along with flashlights, batteries, etc. For more ideas, see: http://www.ready.gov/kit)

Build or designate a safe room.Rooms that can typically be used include basements, garages, interior rooms on the first floor, etc. The room should have no windows, be anchored to the ground to avoid uplift, and be strong enough to withstand any flying debris it may come in contact with. Be aware that water may accompany the storm, so be cautious when using below ground rooms, as they may collect water.

Arrange and secure household items.Arrange furniture so that it is away from windows, mirrors or glass. This could cause broken glass to fly during the tornado, creating a hazard. Make sure any items that may move during the storm are moved away from your family. Use eye bolts or l brackets to secure large furniture to the walls.

, Tornadoes usually only develop in the presence of thunderstorms (though the thunderstorm may be some distance away from you), so lightning, rain, and hail (especially if occurring after a tornado watch or warning has been issued) should put you on guard. In addition, watch out for the following:


Darkening skies, particularly if the sky appears a sickly greenish color (indicating hail) or an orange-y color (dust being blown around by high winds)
Strong, persistent rotation of the cloud base
Very calm and quiet conditions during or right after a thunderstorm

A rumble or roar that sounds like continuous thunder or, sometimes, a train or jet
Whirling debris near the ground, even in the absence of a funnel cloud.
Blue-green or white flashes at ground level in the distance at night – a sign of power lines being snapped by high winds

, Even if you know the signs of a tornado, you can't always rely on your own eyes and ears alone to know if one is coming. Listen to local radio stations or watch local TV to stay informed, especially during conditions that are likely to form tornadoes. Also purchase a ""Self Powered"" Radio/Flashlight combo unit. This will allow you to stay informed, doesn't use batteries, and it provides light. See the entry about finding and using ""Self Powered"" Radios listed below.


In the U.S. the best way to get information about severe weather is to get a NOAA weather radio. These can be purchased cheaply at most big box retailers and outdoor supply stores. If possible, find one with backup battery power and a tone-alert feature, which automatically notifies you when the National Weather Service issues a severe weather watch or warning for your area.
Find a website with a local radar link or page. This will give you a real-time look at storm cells in your area, and because you can see the intensity and direction of movement of storm cells and systems relevant to your home, you can judge more accurately when precautions should be taken. Several weather websites have this feature.
Find out if your community has tornado sirens and learn what they sound like. If you hear these sirens, seek shelter immediately.

, The National Weather Service in the U.S. issues both watches and warnings for severe weather.


A tornado watch indicates that conditions are right for tornado development and tornadoes are possible in your area. If you hear a tornado watch or a severe thunderstorm watch, you should pay special attention to weather conditions.
A PDS tornado watch is issued when a powerful supercell (storms that form tornadoes ) is in the area and has a chance of creating a significant tornado (EF2+ 135MPH+), or starting a tornado outbreak. When this watch is issued, be prepared to take immediate shelter; expect a PDS Tornado Warning OR Tornado Emergency, and take special actions in case it forms an outbreak.
A tornado warning indicates that a tornado has been seen in your area or that radar indicates the presence of a tornado. If a tornado warning is issued, you should seek appropriate shelter immediately.
A PDS tornado warning is issued when a powerful storm is very likely to develop a significant (EF2+ 135MPH+) tornado or is likely to develop a tornado outbreak.
A tornado emergency means that a significant tornado (EF2+ 135MPH+) has been confirmed on the ground in your area or that an outbreak has been confirmed to be severe (containing 135MPH+ tornadoes). When these warning are issued, take cover immediately.
A severe thunderstorm warning means that a severe thunderstorm has been spotted in your area, and you should take appropriate precautions and watch for tornadoes.
Keep maps of your local area handy, so that you can identify the location of a storm when it is reported on the radio.

, Do not stand by windows, or near anything that could possibly hit you (bookcases, chairs, etc.). Put as many walls between you and the storm as possible.

If you are in a mobile home or trailer, find the nearest secure structure. These places, even when secured down, offer little protection.

If you have a car, attempt to drive to the nearest shelter away from the storm. If that's not possible, stay in your car, duck below and cover yourself with a blanket. Keep your seat belt on.

If you are in an open field, duck closest to the ground and cover your head. Do not hide under a bridge or overpass. Most importantly, watch out for flying debris.
Note: Never try to outrun the storm.

, Never leave your shelter until you are sure that the storm has passed and that it is safe to follow the next directions. High winds can still be dangerous, so do not go outside if debris is still moving in the air or on the ground.

, If someone needs medical assistance, wait out the storm, and then seek help.

, Damage to one of the pipes or switches could cause a fire or explosion. Never light a match or use a lighter if you suspect that there may be a gas leak, or if you have not already turned off the utilities.

, Note all damage, but mostly look for any structural damage that could be an immediate harm to your family. If you suspect a part of your home is not safe, leave and find a shelter.

, If you or your family need medical attention or suspect structural damage that may be threatening in your home, seek a center. These often have supplies, but it's important to bring what emergency supplies you can with you.

, The high winds may return, placing you once again in danger's way. Stay tuned to the radio for more information on the situation in your town or neighborhood.

, Move hazardous objects with care, and make a note for your insurance company on what has been damaged. Taking pictures will help later with claims.

, If your family and property were unharmed, be thankful, but remember that not everyone was so lucky. Join in rescue efforts or volunteer. Always follow the orders of public officials when doing so, to make sure that you are being constructive and not damaging the situation further.

Rent a campsite.,
Head to a national park.,
Post up in a parking lot overnight.,
Take refuge at a rest stop.,
Go off road.",How to Camp in Your Car2," If doing some actual camping is what you have in mind, your best course of action is to simply pay to reserve a small campsite for a few days. Renting a campground is usually pretty inexpensive, so you’ll still be saving time and money by taking your own car and packing minimally. You’ll enjoy designated restrooms and bathing areas, and avoid being hassled by police and other passersby, since you’re using the site for its intended purpose.In many cases, you can secure a campsite overnight for as little as $10-20.
Browse the internet for a comprehensive list of campgrounds in your immediate vicinity., National parks and forests make great places to stay if you happen to be nearby. Most national parks have laws in place that make it legal to camp or spend the night in designated areas as long as you abide by other ordinances, like not lighting fires or littering. It’s also a great way to be closer to nature and see the kind of wondrous landscapes that your destination has to offer.Look into whether camping is allowed in a particular park before stopping there.

, You won’t always be have the option of booking a campsite or be close to a national park. Should you get too drowsy to continue driving or find yourself with no alternative, pull off into the parking lot of a department store or super center and rest until you’re in good enough shape to hit the road again. These places are well-lit, patrolled by security and in range of restaurants and other resources. Management typically don’t mind when cars are left there overnight.Make sure your presence isn’t intrusive to business. Be courteous and leave right away if you’re asked.Pop into a superstore to empty your bladder, freshen up and replenish your provisions before you depart.

, Head to the far corner of a highway rest stop and snooze away. These welcoming establishments were designed to provide sanctuary to the weary and wayward. Even better, if you need a bite to eat, a stimulating cup of coffee or a trip to the restroom, you’ll be able to take care of all your basic needs in one place.Be on the lookout for rest stops on highway and interstate markers.
You can also use rest stops to take advantage of the opportunity to wash up, buy fresh supplies or charge your phone., When all else fails, you can always pull over for a few hours on a quiet stretch of country road, a gravel lot or unpopulated turn-off. Lock your doors and put up your window screens and be ready to set out at a moment’s notice. Because these places aren’t strictly meant for camping, though, it’s advisable not to hang around for too long. Rest up and be on your way.Make sure you’re far enough off the main road to remain inconspicuous and avoid being clipped by another vehicle passing in the dark.
In general, it’s unwise to loiter in isolated locations or in places where you’re not wanted. Only stop in an out-of-the-way spot if you have no other option.
Step away to discreetly do your business in the woods, or behind the cover of a bush or structure that offers some privacy.

Stretch out.,
Pack a sleeping bag or blankets.,
Keep your windows covered.,
Buy an eye mask.",How to Camp in Your Car3," When it comes time to get some shut-eye, negotiate your space and lay down as best you can. Recline your seat back or fold down the rear row of seats if possible so you’ll have some leg room while you drift off. You’ll wake up feeling much more rested and refreshed if you don’t spend all night in a cramped, unnatural position.For those who drive smaller cars, try laying across the back seat on your side with your knees slightly tucked.Some trucks and SUVs may be large enough for you to completely stretch out in.

, A good sleeping bag will provide warmth and breathability overnight no matter where you’re stopped. If you don’t have one, invest in a couple oversized thermal blankets so that you don’t freeze when temperatures drop overnight. Fold your sleeping bag or blankets up and stash them away once you’re mobile again to save space for other items.Storage space permitting, carry a pillow or bedroll with you to make sleeping in a confined space a little more pleasant.
Cars are poorly insulated, so it can often get very cold overnight, even during the warmer months.

, Privacy can sometimes be an issue when sleeping in your car—no one wants to wake up to a prying set of eyes gazing at them through the window. Remedy this by using towels, blankets or some other improvised screen to create a barrier over the windows that will hide you from view when you turn in for the night (and block out the glare of the early morning sunrise). Window screens will also come in handy when you’re changing clothes or performing personal hygiene.Additionally, covering your windows can help keep your car cooler in hot climates by softening direct sunlight.
Crack a couple windows or the sunroof to ventilate your car while you sleep. That way, you won’t be greeted by the stifling humidity of your own breath when you wake up., When you’re drained from a night of driving or sight-seeing, the thing you dread most is to be forced awake by the first glimmer of light. Strapping on a cheap eye mask will improve your quality of sleep at any time of day. This will be especially useful for quick naps, or those times that you’re driving all night and sleeping through the afternoon.This invaluable little accessory can be bought for just a few dollars and is guaranteed to give you longer, more restful sleep.
Just be careful—you may sleep so well that you lose track of what time of day it is!

Determine the appropriate amount and types of food that will coordinate well with your particular camping trip.,
Plan all meals ahead of time.,
Estimate how much food you will eat at each meal, and try to avoid leftovers.,
Shop at a store that will fit your particular needs.,
Keep food safe by maintaining proper temperatures.",How to Buy Food for Camping,"


Consider how many days you will be staying at your campsite, whether or not you will have a cooler with ice, and whether you will drive up or hike in to your campsite. It is also important to consider if you will have access to running water, a fire and/or grill, and how much time you are willing to spend prepping and cleaning up for meals.;
, After you have answered all the important questions about the nature of your camping trip, you can begin to plan your menu.


Brainstorm simple, easy-to-prepare meals with your fellow campers. Limiting the amount of time it takes to prepare and clean up after meals allows you to spend more time exploring and relaxing.
Take into account the amount of time it takes to build a fire and make hot coals to cook food over if you do not have a propane camp stove. It will be more difficult to cook if you run out of sunlight, and it might affect other plans you have if it takes you twice as long to cook than you accounted for.
When planning items to bring to construct meals, remember the types of utensils and kitchen gadgets that will be available to you. For example, if you don't have a can opener in your camping supplies, make sure any cans you bring have pull-off tabs. Tuna that comes in foil packets work well as camping staples because they are completely other than cans are a better choice for camping.

, Leftovers may attract animals, or you may lack the resources to keep them from going bad. The key to figuring out how to buy food for camping is making sure you have enough, but not too much. This can be accomplished by supplementing meals with items like nuts or granola bars that won't spoil if not eaten.

, If you are taking a camping trip in which you'll have access to a cooler and a car to keep food in at night, you are likely to find everything you need at your favorite grocery store. If you are taking a more advanced backpacking or canoeing trip into the wilderness, you will likely need to buy most of your items from a camping or sporting good store. These types of stores generally sell freeze dried items in foil packages that are lightweight, portable, and will not spoil during multiple days in the back country. You will also want to buy a water purification system or iodine tablets so that you have safe drinking water during this type of expedition.

, Store food that needs to be kept cold in a cooler with ice, and plan to eat perishable items earlier in the trip unless you plan to restock your cooler with ice regularly.

Find a spot.,
Take along the right people.,
Bring the right tools.,
Enjoy!",How to Camp in the Wilderness," Pick out a nearby State or National park and look it up online. Without proper planning, you might end up having a terrible time if members of your party want electricity and plumbing.;
, Some people love to ""rough it,"" but many people don't and will be missing their refrigerator, stove, and bathtub before 24 hours is up. Good friends that get along and won't end up ruining the trip are essential. Also, don't go camping without someone that is experienced in at least something... Does anyone know how to tie a knot or build a fire? Invite your Army buddy, you'll be glad later.

, Plan for anything, and a misadventure turns out well. Plan for nothing, and something will go wrong and you won't have fun. Bring along the basics: Water, Fire, Shelter, Food. Bring the beer if someone feels like carrying it. A basic first aid kit is a must, along with lighters, flares, and if you're going extremely far from civilization, an emergencies radio beacon.

, As long as the weather doesn't turn bad on you, you probably enjoyed roasting weenies and marshmallows over the campfire with really good friends. Mixed company is great for this type of trip.

Consider which shape you're most comfortable with.,
Consider the pillow material.,
Narrow your travel pillow options down by size and weight.,
Test the pillow mechanism--if it packs down small or inflates and deflates--several times to make sure it's sturdy and easy to use.,
Practice removing the pillow's cover, if it has one, then working the pillow back into the cover.",How to Buy a Travel Pillow," The most common travel pillow shapes include a U-shape, a wedge shape or a roughly cylindrical shape.


You'll also encounter less-common shapes, such as ring-shaped pillows, sleep collars that fit all the way around your neck, or pillows that fasten to your seat with a strap across the front of your body.
This might require extensive testing on your part. Simulate the airline experience by using the pillow in the backseat of your car. If you plan on sleeping with your travel pillow, take it to bed with you a few times to make sure it's comfortable.;
,


Common travel pillow materials include memory foam and polyester.
There's no point in purchasing or using a travel pillow if it's not comfortable. As you test potential travel pillows, note whether you are consistently more or less comfortable with a particular material. For example, memory foam offers high malleability with relatively low support compared to an inflatable pillow.

, The pillow should be large enough to provide comfortable rest--test your pillow before you travel--but not so large or heavy that you can't pack it in your carry-on luggage.


If your travel pillow deflates or squishes down to a small size for packing, take both its packed size and the fully deployed size into account.

,


Pay particular attention to whether any air valves stick out enough to get caught and possibly damaged, and whether the valve is difficult to extract once you press it flush with the rest of the pillow.
Check the pillow seams for any signs of loose threads or shoddy construction. Loose seams spell disaster for an inflatable pillow, but can cause problems for other types of travel pillows too.

,


Ideally, the entire pillow should be washable. But having a washable, removable cover in addition is even better.

Keep a record of your purchase.",How to Buy a Sleeping Bag," There are three types of bags meant for comfortable sleeping in hot, mild, and cold weather. Purchasing a bag for the wrong season will guarantee you spend the night either drenched in sweat or listening to your teeth chatter.Summer bags protect you against temperatures higher than about 32°F (0°C). These bags are lightweight, and they have full-length zippers that allow you to ventilate and cool off on hot summer nights.
Three-season bags are good for temperatures above 20°F (-7°C), so they’re optimal for spring and fall travel, or a summer trip in the mountains. They may be a good pick for those who aren’t sure when they’ll be travelling.
Winter bags should be purchased for temperatures below 20°F (-7°C).;
, This rating gives you the bag’s optimal temperature for comfortable sleeping, along with its lower and extreme, or “survival-only,” limits. These ratings are made for the average sleeper, so you may want to add about 10 degrees to the lower limit, especially if you’re planning on cold-weather camping.The clothing you wear will affect your sleeping experience. The ratings on cold-weather bags assume that you’re wearing long underwear (top and bottom), thick socks, and possibly a hat. Whether you’re camping in warm or cold weather, make sure that your clothing is dry before you climb inside your sleeping bag at night, as this will also help with warmth.

, Your bag will contain either down or synthetic fill. Each of these insulations provides different benefits based on their weight, warmth, water resistance, and price.Down (duck or goose feather) bags weigh less for the warmth you receive, and they usually last longer than synthetic bags. However, they’re not generally water resistant, and they’re considerably more expensive than most synthetic options.
Synthetic (polyester or nylon) bags stay reasonably dry in wet weather, and they dry out quickly when they do get wet. They’re also cheaper than down and are hypo-allergenic. Even so, they weigh more than down options and don’t pack as well.

, This bag’s tapered cut around the legs and feet ensures that your body heat stays contained in the bag, making them the most efficient bags for keeping you warm. Because they use less material, they’re also lighter and easier to pack. However, those who move or shift in their sleep will want to steer clear of the mummy sleeping bag, which is far more constrictive than other choices.

, These bags allow more movement than mummy sleeping bags, but they also let more body heat escape. The majority of these bags can also be unzipped completely and used as blankets. They’re best suited for warm-weather camping.

, This option provides a middle ground between mummy and rectangular bags. They are bulkier and more difficult to pack than mummies, but they’ll also give you more space to move while keeping you warm., Camping experts agree that placing a sleeping pad under your bag is the best way to stay warm and dry. Pads vary in weight and material, and you should choose an option for your particular packing and seasonal needs., While most sleeping bags come with their own storage sacks, these sacks don’t always keep water out. A wet sleeping bag can make for a miserable trip, especially if the weather prevents you from laying your bag out to dry.


This add-on is an especially good idea for those who choose to buy less less water resistant down bags.

, Bags can’t be cleaned with typical laundry detergents, nor can they make a trip to the dry cleaner. Unless you plan on using a special camping-gear cleaning service, prepare to purchase a bag cleaner when you buy your bag. There are many reasonably priced cleaning and waterproofing products., Adding a pillow to your pack will help you avoid cricks in your neck and bumps on the ground. You should choose an inflatable pillow if you’re prioritizing easy packing and lower weight over comfort. Compressible options are good for optimizing comfort despite the extra weight. There are also hybrid options for mid-level comfort and weight.If you’re going car camping, you can bring along your pillow from home.

, Your choices regarding the seasonal type, your prefered fill material, and shape will affect the cost of your sleeping bag. The most expensive bags tend to be down bags fit for extremely cold weather, while the least expensive options will be lightweight, synthetic summer bags., A cross-section of opinions from other buyers and bloggers can help expose common problems with particular sleeping bags. These reviews will likely also point you in the direction of the best prices for the highest quality options.

, Talking to campers in your social circle should give you honest and unfiltered information about people’s preferences and experiences with particular brands and types of bags. The people who know you best will also be familiar with your particular needs, so they can provide tailored advice.

, It’s better to make an in-store visit so you can test out various sleeping bags. The best way to know what you like is to crawl inside different kinds of bags, move around, and zip yourself up, reflecting on the fit and material as you do so. If the bag doesn’t feel right in the store, it won’t satisfy you in the wilderness.


Inspect the zipper of each sleeping bag. Some zippers will catch or break easily, and you may be able to discern this tendency in the store.

, If you don’t have easy access to a sporting or outdoor activites store, you’ll likely want to make your purchase online. If this is the case, you’ll need to take extra care examining the product before you buy.


Bundle your camping gear into one online purchase. Shipping costs will add up quickly if you make multiple individual purchases.

, Save the receipt for in-store transactions or flag the email confirmation for online payments. If your bag is defective, you’ll want to be able to make an easy and painless exchange.

Pack survival tools.,
Take necessary personal items.,
Bring camping gear.,
Take food.,
Pack the right cooking utensils.",How to Camp1," These items will help you better navigate the camping area and may come in handy in an emergency.

Bring flashlights or lanterns. For late night hikes or middle-of-the-night bathroom calls, a portable light source is a must. Make sure you take the correct batteries for your light source.



 


Store matches in a plastic bag or bring a lighter and lighter fluid. Lanterns and flashlights are great for the dark, but you will also need to build fires if your campsite does not have fire rings for cooking. Also remember to bring newspapers to help start your fire.






Bring a map of the area you will be camping in. In case you become lost and do not have a cell phone, you will need to know how to navigate back to your campsite. To better help you navigate, take a compass as well; simply align the compass so that the edge connects your current location to your intended destination. Follow the arrow while it is pointed at your intended destination.






Take a first aid kit. Being able to bandage and disinfect wounds obtained in the wilderness is a top priority. Remember the Boy Scouts motto: ""Be prepared!""Bring a shiny belt to signal helicopters in case you get lost. If traveling with other people, create a yell and Bing a whistle to signal each other in case you get lost.;
, Even if you plan on ""roughing it,"" be sure to bring basic toiletries and hygiene tools.

Pack a toothbrush, soap, towels, and toilet paper. Even if your campsite doesn't offer a public restroom and shower, you will need to brush, bathe, and use the bathroom often.






Pack enough clothes. Make sure that you dress according to the area and weather. Boots, sweaters, worn jeans, and t-shirts are better suited than nice jeans, sneakers, and polo shirts. If camping in cold or rainy weather, be sure to wear thick, waterproof clothing.






Remember to bring prescription medications and asthma inhalers. If you have allergies, bring your EpiPen or over the counter allergy medicines. If you are female, make sure to bring essential feminine care products.






Bring a pocket knife.Knives come in handy for small but important tasks like opening food bags or mark trees when hiking. Buy a Swiss army knife as a more reliable and versatile option; Swiss army knives have specialized tools like bottle openers and scissors.Store items in backpacks and large duffle bags. These are more mobile and easier to carry than luggage.







, If you are camping on public grounds and do not intend to use local lodging, make sure you bring the necessary housing items.

Bring your tent along with a mallet for staking tent loops and rain fly loops to the ground. If you plan on camping in rain, take a tarp to waterproof your tent.






Take plenty of blankets. Even though you may be camping during summer, nights can get cold quickly. You can also layer blankets on the floor of your inner tent. This will cushion your tent floor and make it easier to sleep.
Pack sleeping bags and pillows. Though both are optional, it's nice being able to keep as warm as possible during the night and rest your head on a soft, cushioned surface.
If your campsite doesn't come equipped with picnic benches and tables, bring folding chairs and tables

, Be sure to check with grounds officials about how to properly store foods to avoid attracting local wildlife.Water bottles and canteens are ideal, especially when hiking. If you plan on doing a lot of physical activities, you will need to stay hydrated especially during hotter weather. Remember to pack a watercooler to help keep water refrigerated.
Lean towards food that is easily cooked over fire. This includes eggs, vegetables, and thin slices of vacuum-packed meat.Don't just take raw foods, take non-perishable foods as well. Chances are you won't be cooking for all meals, and having foods that won't spoil in hot weather is a nice option to have.Make sure you take recipes along with the food you intend to cook.
Pack all perishable foods in tightly sealed plastic bags. Keeping moisture out will help them stay edible longer. For fragile foods like eggs, cushion plastic bags with folded paper towels.
Remember camping classics. Take marshmallows, chocolate, and graham crackers to make S'mores! Simply roast marshmallows over an open flame and sandwich them between a bar of chocolate and two graham crackers.







, Some campsites do not have fire rings or allow camp stoves, so be prepared to cook over an open flame.


Knives specifically for cutting food are handy to have. Pocket knives, while useful, are not made for slicing meat or chopping vegetables.
Pack pots and pans for cooking over a flame.Camp-friendly pots and pans aren't just more portable than regular kitchenware, they are specifically tailored for open flame cooking (for example, stainless steal pots with heavy duty bottoms for even heat distribution).Bring eating utensils. Cups, plates, forks, and spoons are essential when eating. Also bring grilling tools like tongs and spatulas to help you cook hot foods.
Bring a barbecue grill, coal, and some bottled beers if your campsite allows it. Barbecuing during hot weather is great for days when you just want to sit and relax.

Know the weather conditions beforehand.,
Pay attention to the material of your tent.,
Pitch a large dome tent.,
Set up an A-frame tent.,
Put up a hoop tent.,
Pitch a pop-up tent.",How to Camp2," Knowing if you'll be facing rain, sunshine, or harsh winds is vital when picking the right tent.


If you'll be camping in rainy conditions, pick a tent with a rain fly (specialized tarp) or use tarp to waterproof your tent. Use a tent porch to store wet items that you don't want inside your tent.
Consider the size of your camping group. If you'll be camping alone in harsh weather, pick a tent that is easily pitched by a single person.

, Some materials are better suited for certain conditions.


Canvas, while durable, is also very heavy and not ideal against rain. Nylon is lighter but is intended for calmer conditions. Polyester is best for sunny and hot weather as it is designed to withstand long exposures to sunlight.
Closely inspect the sturdiness of your tent. If you'll be facing strong winds, make sure to bring a tent with strong poles, high quality pegs, and secured fastenings. For maximum durability, choose a tent with double-sewn seams., If you're camping with relatives, you'll often share a tent with a wife, brother, or sister.


Large dome tents, or ""workhorse"" tents, have broad roofs and rounded frames, making them very spacious. They might just fit your entire family.Dome tents are stable, easy to set up, and made for harsher conditions like snow.
These tents are usually free-standing, meaning they can be moved around once they have been erected. This is ideal if the weather worsens or if the wind direction changes.
Some dome tents afford the luxury of having separate rooms or porches to store gear and equipment.

, These tents are typical if you are camping or sleeping alone.


A-frame tents are the easiest to pitch but are not as sturdy against strong winds. They consist of two parallel, vertical poles supporting a center pole across the roof.When erected, their structure resembles the letter ""A.""
This style of tent is lightweight but does not offer much room due to the steep, sloping sides.
Bring a tarp to waterproof your tent. Standard A-frame tents do not come with rain flies.
For a roomier alternative, opt for a modified A-frame tent. This tent uses curved rather than straight poles, offering greater stability, more space, and rain fly protection.

, Hoop tents have 3 arched frames with curved poles at all ends to help retain shape and stability.


If using a hoop tent, guy ropes need to be tied and staked for stable pitching. Fabrics that are not staked down properly will flap in the wind.This design is best for rain or snow as both will slide off upon contact.
Hoop tents are the lightest and most compact tents.
Standard hoop tents typically service two people.
If camping alone, choose a single hoop tent. This uses a single curved pole and is lighter and more compact. Single hoop tents are not as sturdy against strong winds but offer a more mobile alternative, ideal when cycling or backpacking., These collapsible tents come pre-assembled and simply need to be unpacked and staked to the ground.


Pop-up tents involve built-in flexible hoops that spring into shape immediately after being unpacked.These tents are typically small and designed for children or smaller adults.
Although flexible and easy to assemble, pop-up tents are usually single skinned and unsuitable for rainy or windy conditions.

Plan your activities and meals ahead of time.,
Research area camp grounds.,
Make a reservation.,
Check in at your campground.,
Tell your camp members your plans beforehand.,
Follow the rules.,
Set up camp.",How to Camp3," Think about how many days you want to camp and whether you want access to bathroom or cooking facilities.


Spread out the activities in your itinerary. If you go hiking one day, plan on swimming or barbecuing the next day.
Look up easy camping recipes.Not only will this help you decide what food to bring, it will tell you what cooking tools are necessary.
Pack your items in advance. Start with essential items like first aid kits and flashlights and end with optional gear like skewers and marshmallows.

, Make sure the environment and scenery are to your liking.


For first time campers, pick a campground that is not so deep in the wilderness. National Parks like Yosemite or Yellowstone are great first time camp spots.
If you don't want to ""rough it"" but still want to enjoy the outdoors, National Parks and National Forests are ideal. They usually provide restrooms, showers, picnic tables, fire rings, and sometimes laundry facilities.Keep in mind the season and weather. If camping during the summer, pick a spot next to a lake or river. For colder seasons, camp near the woods.Find out if there are any local attractions that you can visit during your stay. For example, if you're camping in Yellowstone, you might want to check out the Old Faithful Geyser.

, Camp grounds are either on public or privately owned land. In either case, you are often required to notify the grounds ahead of time before setting up camp.


Call or book your reservation online. You will need to supply vital information like your name, address, and billing information.
You will need to notify the grounds of your arrival time and length of stay. Grounds management may also ask if you require a wheelchair accessible campsite or if you are bringing any pets.After providing the necessary information, the grounds will notify you if they have available reservations.
Be sure to make your reservation long in advance. This will give you enough time to pick the right campsite and plan your trip accordingly.
National Parks and other public grounds sometimes allow you to camp without a reservation. You will be informed of which areas you are allowed to camp in and what living quarters you are allowed to bring (whether RVs are allowed and what size)., Before setting up camp, you must notify management that you have arrived for safety and tracking reasons.


You will be assigned a certain site within the grounds or you may have the option of picking a site.
If you're camping in hot weather, choose a place close to a water supply and under some shade. Tents can become oven-like in the summer, so be sure to pick the coolest spot possible.If your campsite offers facilities, choose an area that is a reasonable distance from a bathroom or shower. If you become injured in some sort of way, having access to running water is better than using water from a lake or river.

, Before going on a hike or exploring the wilderness, be sure to disclose your plan in full detail.


Provide details of where you're going, when you plan on returning, and directions and alternate routes that can be taken. Supply your cell phone number if you brought a cell phone.If camping on public grounds, know how to contact the park or forest rangers. If camping on private land, keep a cell phone with local authority numbers already programmed into the phone (for example, state police or sheriff's department).If camping alone, keep your compass or cell phone with you at all times. In case of an emergency, you will need to know how to contact park rangers or navigate to secure areas.

, Every campground has a set of safety and courtesy regulations that every camper must follow.


Get clearance and required permits for planned activities. Some places have rules and restrictions regarding fishing and hiking. Inquire about these at the ranger station or check online.
Make sure you are using environment safe equipment. Ask campground personnel about seasonal fire or campstove restrictions ahead of time.Check with local park or forest agents about how to properly store your food. The last thing you want to wake up to is a hungry bear rummaging through your watercooler.
Be safe. Only camp and congregate in authorized areas. Areas that have been declared ""off-limits"" are in place to protect you from animals or other environmental dangers, or to protect the local vegetation and wildlife.Respect the wildlife. Don't litter and don't feed any local animals. Remember that you are a guest in this natural habitat.
Be courteous. When camping on public grounds, chances are you will be near fellow campers who are also trying to enjoy the outdoors. Try not to be too loud or too imposing when pursuing activities.

, Begin unpacking your items and pitching tents.


Try to set up camp while the sun is up. Organizing food and pitching tents is much more difficult in campfire or lantern light.
Position your items in a practical manner. Place tents away from fire sources and close to water sources, store food in easily accessible but safe areas, and keep safety materials like flashlights and first aid kits in every tent.
When done with a campfire, douse it with plenty of water. Remember the classic words of Smokey the Bear: ""Only you can prevent wildfires.""Be sure that you take all your items with you when you break camp. Any garbage should be picked up and thrown away. Use a broom to brush away residual food particles so that you do not attract wildlife.

Find a flat area.,
Look above for dead branches.,
Look for trees you can use.,
Consider the weather.",How to Build a Tarp Shelter1," The best areas for building a tarp shelter are places that have flat ground. This can make creating the shelter a bit easier and will allow you a more comfortable place to sleep in. Take some time to find a nice, flat area before building your tarp shelter., Once you've found a nice place on the ground for your shelter, you will want to look above it. Dead branches can pose a serious hazard to campers if they are knocked down by wind. Always avoid placing your shelter under any branches that look old, dead, or dangerous to avoid having one fall on you., Many tarp shelter designs require you to place a sturdy cord or rope between two trees. This cord will act as the ridge-line for your tarp shelter. It's a good idea to look for a flat spot that has two trees for you to place this cord between.If you can't find two trees, you could try placing two anchor branches in the ground instead.
These trees should be roughly as far apart as your tarp is long.

, Although it may be sunny and dry when you set your tarp shelter up, the weather may change during your camping trip. It's important to consider what the weather might do in the near future, allowing you to stay comfortable and avoid any damage to your tarp shelter.Figure out which way the winds are blowing. Any “wall” of your tarp shelter should face away from the wind.
Avoid putting your shelter in any areas that are low or seem like they could flood during rain storms.

"
Consider whether there are there any semi-permanent lodgings on the grounds not owned by the campsite.,
Don't make the assumption that if you buy a campsite you will own everything you see.

,
Find out what the terms and conditions are for the owners of those chalets; in short how long are you legally obliged to continue to rent out the space to that particular owner?,
Be open to having such tenants.,
Find out whether such chalets have their own toilets and showers, otherwise they may be counted as users of your toilet facilities and therefore limit the number of visitors you can accept for a given star rating.,
Be conscious that star ratings vary from country to country, region to region and indeed from camping organisation to organisation.,
Be realistic.,
Note whether there a swimming pool on the campsite.,
Understand what pool ownership involves.,
Be pragmatic.,
Learn what the local rules or regulations demand.,
Find out what your obligations are in terms of simple First Aid and public fire-fighting equipment and training.,
Check out what local taxes or fees you may be eligible for.,
Consider whether permits have been obtained for the number of spaces or pitches already operated.,
If you plan to expand the campsite, talk to the relevant authorities before purchase.,
Remember that sewerage does not travel uphill, at least not without specialist sewerage pumps, so you need to consider the existing layout when considering expanding into areas of differing elevations.,
Find out who the most important camping bodies and organisations are for the relevant country.,
Don't buy a campsite until you have slept in it a few nights - seriously!,
Get chatting to other users of the site.,
Be aware of any seasonal issues.,
Be aware that one of the primary considerations for anyone thinking of buying a campsite, hotel or other small tourist business is that you must know your market.,
Know your target market and what their standards are.,
Look around to find out what the main attractions are in the area.,
In the initial author's experience, some campsite businesses do very well in areas that seem rather unremarkable.,
Never buy a tourist business while only looking at it as a lifestyle business, namely, with a view to your personal lifestyle.,
It is usual for small family run campsites to come with a house for the owner to live in.,
Another way to summarise what is being said here?,
Get the relevant professional advice to establish the legal boundaries of the campsite.,
Consider the road or track leading up to your campsite as your lifeline.,
Arrange to talk to a local figure of political authority, such as a mayor, councilor or politician.,
Check out the local competition, in particular any sites run by local government, council or authority, as these may have very competitive rates, superior advertising muscle and high standards.

,
Provide food options.,
If you are not keen on being responsible for a restaurant yourself, then another option is to buy your campsite within easy reach of existing restaurants and then form a co-operative relationship with these businesses.,
Have refrigeration storage options available.,
In most cases the revenue generated from campers in tents is much lower than that collected from RV owners (in Europe these are known as campervans) and caravans.,
One point to note is that those sleeping in tents often feel very uncomfortable when large vehicles are moving around in their vicinity, especially if they are still asleep in the morning.",How to Buy a Campsite or Campground Business," This will vary from country to country but many campsites do rent plots to owners of chalets or log cabins. This is very important as the following points indicate.;
,, Do you have the right to change the rental rate? Under what terms could you evict a problematic client.

, Clients of this nature often represent a desirable and steady income – the benefit in terms of peace of mind of a reasonable guaranteed income, rain or shine, cannot be underestimated when you are making monthly repayments on your business loan.

, This is a very important issue that is the subject of the next section.

, For instance, you may have a two star with the local authorities and have a three star in a particular camping guide. Star ratings usually take into account the number of toilets and showers available to a given number of guests; for instance, one toilet to twenty people might deliver a two star and one toilet to forty people might deliver a one star. Be aware then that expansion of the campsite without similar expansion of facilities may lower your star rating.

, Unfortunately many camping authorities give star ratings for facilities that campers are not interested in, so don't be surprised to find a campsite littered with table tennis tables that no-one is using - the owner is probably just ""chasing stars"".

, If so, then does it conform to local regulations? Is the equipment in good order with evidence of maintenance? Local regulations may stipulate that the pool is surrounded by a childproof fence and also that a qualified lifeguard is on duty when the pool is open. Fully researching this issue properly is an absolute must. For instance, in Italy a full time ""pool boy"" or bagnini is required for any campsite pool. This raises issues of needing to employ an additional employee with the associated running costs. However, in Denmark no such provision is required. Prospective buyers in the US are advised to consult state authorities.

, A pool may be a must in hot locations but do not underestimate the work or commitment involved in running a clean, legal and safe pool for your clients. What is the peak season temperature of the water without any additional heating? Will you need heating and if so is solar an option?

, Not all campers consider a pool a bonus, those seeking a quiet retreat often view pools as a bonus in terms of an additional facility but as a negative in terms of attracting other campers of a noisier disposition. Some campers on balance actually seek out campsites that lack certain amenities that are judged to be attractions for a different sector of the market.

, Once again this will vary from country to country but the types of things you need to think about include the width of roads and the passable width of any gates. Emergency vehicles will need to turn around when they exit the campsite; the 'turning circle' of a fire fighting vehicle is not small. It is worth talking to the local fire-fighting agency to find out what is required for the larger fire-fighting emergency vehicles. At the same time, get any oil or gas fuel tanks checked over and ensure any required permits are in place.

, Don't assume that the existing owner has ticked all the boxes - the authorities will not excuse any serious omission on your part, on account of the conduct of the previous owner.

, In many countries, businesses pay higher rates for services than private homes.

, Similar with any semi-permanent buildings.

, It is not just a matter of permission for more pitches – it is also a matter of what obligations you may have in terms of upgrading existing infrastructure, electricity supply, water supply, sewerage, access, security, health and safety. For instance, the electrical supply may only be sufficient for the electric current demand of the existing number of pitches so existing cable work may need replacing.

, Is the capacity sufficient for current use and any expansion plans? Has the system been inspected by the relevant state or local authorities - have they issued any demands for improvements and, if so, how long would you have to comply and how much would it cost?

, Most will have a website or year book; check if to see if the campsite is listed and if so, what comments and ratings are given. Most large camping organisations also have inspectors who visit sites – find out what they are looking for when they rate a campsite. For instance, a certain governing body in Europe stipulates a minimum shower cubicle width as a condition for a certain star rating - if cubicles have already been built but are too small, then obtaining higher star ratings may prove expensive. You could choose to view the inspector's demands as a hurdle to jump but actually he only represents the wishes of the majority of campers in the organisation he represents, so really his comments should be seen as valuable commercial advice - ignore the wishes of your campers at your peril!

, Take your tent or your camper van (or RV in America) and stay for a few nights. Use the toilets, showers, and the facilities and ask yourself if you would stay there yourself? Try to time your morning visit to the washrooms and toilets to be right in the middle of peak demand - this when you will get to see if the existing infrastructure can handle demand and whether the mood in the air is satisfaction or impatience and frustration. Remember that these people are potentially your future clients, so you need to get inside their heads and understand exactly how they feel about this campground.

, Some may be regular clients who can tell you a lot of useful information about the campsite and also the surrounding attractions - how many times have they returned and what keeps them coming back? Regulars will be able to tell you whether there are any noise issues or similar disturbance problems associated with the immediate area that might be a problem. Do not base your decision to buy a campsite on one overnight stay; spend a week or longer if you can.

, Floods, storms, nuisance insects such as army ants or mosquitoes, etc. can be an issue. Familiarise yourself with regional climate and animal or insect life that may affect your clients.

, This includes knowing your clients' age ranges, whether they are families or retired couples, and understanding their idea of a perfect vacation. If this aspect of research does not interest you, it is recommended that you re-consider whether a small tourist business is really a good choice for you.

, For instance, in continental Europe the Dutch are very keen campers but they are also known for their expectation of high standards of cleanliness. As such, you will not penetrate this lucrative sector of the market without spotless toilets and very regular cleaning schedules.

, Beach, sea, mountains or cultural cities? How does this affect the type of client and their duration of stay? Do most people stay a week or are they passing through. Neither is necessarily best; a steady stream of people staying only two nights on their way to some other destination might be a very good line of business but it will mean you spend more time settling arrivals into their allotted pitches.

, This might be because there does seem to be a type of camper who just enjoys being in a field, cooking on a barbecue and enjoying fresh air. However it is considered that such a prospect is at best risky and should only be considered on the evidence of several years worth of financial figures. In general, the first maxim for tourist businesses does apply to campsites equally well and that maxim is: ""location location location"".

, Always take the view of your customer - ask yourself the question would you come and stay as a paying customer?

, Some naive buyers fall in love with a great deal on the house and forget that the rest of the campsite has no really strong attraction for the camper.

, Think of your customer first and then consider your private living circumstances second; the reverse priority is unlikely to favour your long term financial prospects. Few people get rich running small campgrounds or hotels. Those who do get rich usually do so by massive expansion and end up leaving what may be called the lifestyle end of this business sector. In general if you favour quality of life above financial income you have a more realistic view.

, Don't trust wire fences or wooden fences. Urban houses tend to have very well defined boundaries but visual indications of boundaries on a campsite may be misleading. If the previous owner has constructed anything of a permanent nature, or relies on access that transgresses a boundary, you may be in for complications.

, Make sure you understand who owns the road and what protection you have for the continued access of your clients. Is the road easily passable in all weather conditions that are likely to occur during tourist season? Find also how service pipes exit the campsite, they may well travel alongside or underneath the service road.

, Take the opportunity to find out whether the local authorities are supportive of the business. In many cases, local authorities are keen to encourage tourism and you will find a favourable response. You may find yourself applying for permits from these people, so it's important that they look favourably on you and your business.

,, Food is a big subject but starting out from the customer's point of view, a lot of campers would like the option of restaurant food and also appreciate somewhere that they can cook for themselves. There are advantages and disadvantages to getting into the restaurant side of things; for one thing, you will need to ensure that cooking and eating areas meet local regulations and even if you franchise out the responsibility of cooking, you will still be the person who is responsible overall. There is a twofold advantage to supplying food: firstly, your revenue will increase on account of direct sales but secondly, you will generally attract more campers if you provide food.

, Distance will, of course, be the main factor here – people will tend to want to be able to stroll to a restaurant in the evening, especially if they are drinking alcohol, so the acceptable range may be only one or two miles or kilometres.

, Many campers consider some form of refrigeration essential. Camper vans or RVs will have their own fridges but those in tents will appreciate somewhere to keep their milk fresh. A recent online poll conducted by the authors on a European website showed that refrigeration was one of the most important considerations for those staying in tents.

, However it's always worth catering for those who favour canvas.

, Consider adding physical barriers to ensure that vehicles and tent occupants remain at a distance from one another - it's much easier to relax inside a tent when you feel that you cannot be accidentally driven over. Incidents are rare but it is a common psychological discomfort if you care to ask tent owners.

Take wind into account when making plans.",How to Block Wind While Camping," If high winds are in the forecast, pick campsites that offer shelter, if possible. Avoid wide-open spaces. Better selections include:

Groves of trees. The trunks of trees will help break the wind naturally.
Rock faces. Wind typically comes from one main direction. If you can find a cliff or rock outcropping that blocks the wind, you will be much better off.;
, You may assume that because it is windy where you are now, it is equally windy every way. Taking a little time to explore the local area--if possible--may reveal it is less windy in a different area. This can greatly reduce the amount of work needed to block the wind at your chosen camp. For example:

Winds may be stronger near a large body of water, such as an ocean or lake.
Valleys, passes, gulches, and the like may form ""wind tunnels"" in which winds are intensified from a certain direction.

, If your campsite is protected against wind on most sides, fill the gap with a tarp. Tie the tarp to trees or structures at a 45º angle to the ground, in front of your tent or campfire.

This may be dangerous in high-wind situations, as tarps may suddenly rip out tent stakes, poles, and so on and could be damaged.
In high-wind situation, you are better off blocking off the smallest possible area well than try to create a large wind-block. For example, blocking off enough area so that the camp stove will work properly is better than trying to set up a 10'x10' tarp to its full area to do the same task.

, If caught in an exposed area where the wind comes from multiple directions, you'll need a shelter you can hunker down inside. Try making an A-frame tarp shelter as emergency cover, or to reinforce your tent's windbreaking ability, as described here., This will typically be made of rocks or scrub. Look for a rocky area with the materials to build your own small wall to lie behind at night. Find scrub, fallen branches, and anything handy to make a barrier. Ideally, you can find a sheltered area between boulders., As a last resort, string up the largest wind-proof clothing you have between two trees. These are thinner and smaller than tarps, but they will help a little, and may prevent your fire from being extinguished by the wind., Another approach is to find a depression in the terrain, or dig one. Lie or stay in this area with a tarp or other protection over you., Even if you're just on a day hike with no camping gear, be prepared to construct a shelter in case of an emergency. As long as the area has a few trees or stout bushes, all you need are these three items:

A lightweight groundsheet made of rip-stop nylon. A ground cloth for a large tent is a good choice, as they are typically made from ripstop nylon coated with waterproof PVC.
A 50 ft. (15 m) coil of ⅛ in. (3 mm) parachute cord (paracord), to serve as a strong, lightweight rope.
A small pocketknife to cut the paracord.

, Find a spot protected on as many sides as possible from the wind. Look for two trees about 6–12 feet (1.8–3.7m) apart on the windward side, forming a line wind's path.

Make sure there are no dead branches above the spot you've chosen to shelter. Strong wind may cause these to fall.

, Tie a length of paracord securely to each tree, about three feet (0.9 m) off the ground. This will be the top of the ""wall"" you create with your groundsheet. If you have cord to spare, stretch a second length of it just above the ground to support the bottom edge of the groundsheet as well., Weigh down the groundsheet with fist-sized rocks or any heavy objects. Alternatively, tie the corners of the groundsheet to the horizontal cord with additional paracord.

You can use trekking poles, ski poles, or even the skis themselves to support additional support for your windbreak.

, If you're caught in rainy weather, position part of the groundsheet on a slope and tie it to another length of cord to form a roof. If the ground is wet, use part of the ground sheet as a underneath you to keep you dry.

With a particularly large groundsheet, you can even improvise a pup tent, stretching each corner taut with another length of paracord. Weigh down the edge of the groundsheet with rocks.

, Wear a thin, windproof outer layer to reduce wind chill in cold weather. This should be made from a lightweight material, breathable enough to minimize trapped sweat. Ideally, your windbreak layer should include trousers as well as a hooded jacket., The less time you spend on ridges and in exposed, windy areas, the better. Walk through sheltered areas such as forests when possible. If you're on an overnight hike, look for a rock shelter before sunset.

Wind is usually much more extreme on one side of a mountain or tall hill. Walk along the lee side instead.

, If weather forecasts predict high winds, understand the risks involved before you go hiking. Windblown snow can reduce visibility to extremely short distances, obscure the trail, or block your access entirely with large drifts. In the desert, wind can whip up dust and irritate your eyes and lungs. If you are not prepared to deal with these conditions, you may need to shorten your hike or cancel it entirely."

Gather around the campfire.,
Go fishing.,
Swim at a local lake.,
Take a hike.,
Play games.",How to Camp4," Camping is all about enjoying nature and the company of others. Leave the high-tech activities at home.


Wait until night or until it gets really dark out. Take turns telling spooky ghost stories around a flickering fire. Watch in amusement as you scare each other with suspenseful stories.
Bring a guitar or other musical instruments. Singing songs and playing instruments is a great way to bring everyone together in a lighthearted way. The best campfire songs are interactive and involve call and response, like ""Sarasponda.""Roast marshmallows or make S'mores. Cooking campfire favorites is a great way to enjoy each other's presence, especially for kids.

, Many public camp grounds, like Yellowstone National Park, offer fly fishing.Clean and gut fish that you have caught from the lake. Throw it on a barbecue grill or skewer it and roast it over an open flame.
Take plenty of photos with fish you have caught. Fish don't just make great entrees, they make awesome trophies too!
Public camp grounds sometimes require you to have a state fishing license., Throw on your bathing suits and cool off during hot summer days.


Make sure swimming is allowed. Some places may have dangerous or sensitive wildlife that can become agitated by swimmers.
Make sure you know how deep a lake is before jumping in and swimming. Too deep a lake may not be best for young children, while too shallow a lake won't be as enjoyable for adults.
Be careful when swimming or diving into a lake. Treat the lake with the same level of caution as you would a swimming pool.
It's always best to swim with people who know CPR. In case of an emergency, you will need someone who can swim well and resuscitate someone who has swallowed water, if necessary.

, Hiking is both a steady workout and a great way to appreciate nature.


Bring maps, compasses, and other items for navigating through the wilderness. Carve a symbol on trees you have passed to help you find your way back to camp.
Drink lots of water and remember to take breaks. Hiking can be a physically tasking activity, especially in very steep or hilly areas.
Use binoculars to observe the wildlife. Some spots are known for the specific animals they have to offer. Try Owl watching, butterfly watching, or observing bats at sunset based on where you're located.Schedule a guided tour. If you're a first time camper trying to get the most out of your stay at a national park, guided tours will help you experience a wide variety of activities. Yellowstone National Park, for example, offers a photography safari and swims in thermally heated rivers., Doing something fun and interactive with family, friends, and kids is the surest way to have a memorable camping experience.


Do an alphabet nature hunt. This is a great activity for young children. Have kids try to spot as many things as they can for every letter of the alphabet (like ""leaf"" or ""dirt""). This not only gets kids active and interested, it helps them expand their knowledge of nature.Have a water fight on hot days. Balloon tosses and squirt gun wars are enjoyable for all ages. For a better experience, throw in some swimming and barbecuing in the background.
Play tug-of-war. Use a shovel to dig a shallow hole in the ground and fill it with water. Position people on either ends of a rope and have them try to pull the other team into the water hole.
Play different types of sports. Bring a Frisbee, football, or a baseball bat and baseball. Sports can be especially unique when played on a campsite. Have a low hanging branch be your volleyball net or use trees as bases. Don't be afraid to get creative when playing sports.

Create the ridge-line.,
Lay the tarp over the rope.,
Anchor the tarp to the ground.",How to Build a Tarp Shelter2," The ridge-line will support the top section of your tarp shelter. This line is created by stringing a length of cord between two trees. This gives your tarp an elevated point of support and will form the shape of the a-frame tarp shelter. Place the ridge-line using these steps:








Tie one section of the rope to a tree. Place it as high up the tree trunk as you would like the roof of your tarp shelter to be.
Bring the other end over to the adjacent tree and tie it at the same level.
Make sure the cord is as tight as it can be to ensure a strong ridge-line.

, Once your ridge-line has been created, you can lay the tarp over top of it. For an a-frame tarp shelter, place the tarp over the ridge-line in the center of the tarp. This will leave equal halves of the tarp hanging down from the ridge-line.




Make sure the tarp is equally hanging from both sides of the ridge-line to avoid problems.

, After you've placed the tarp over the ridge-line, you can fasten it to the ground. Take one of the bottom sections of tarp and pull it outwards, away from the center of the tent. Once you've gotten it to a place that you like, secure it to the ground by taking these steps:








Place a tent stake into the ground, near to the point the tarps corner while it is stretched out.
Tie a length of cord between the tent stake and the corner of the tarp.
Make sure this cord is tight and holds the tarp securely to the ground.
Do the same thing for each of the other three corners of your a-frame tarp shelter.

"
"
Find a good spot for the cord.,
Fix one edge of the tarp to the cord.,
Anchor the tarp to the ground.",How to Build a Tarp Shelter3," The lean-to tarp shelter makes use of a ridge-line. This ridge-line is created by tying a length of rope tightly between two trees or other points of support. This will create a point that you can secure your tarp to and finish your shelter.Find two trees that are as far apart as your tarp is long.
Tie one end of the rope around the trunk of a tree. Tie it at the height that you want the top of your shelter to be at.
Tie the other end of the rope at the same level on the opposite tree.
It's very important that the ridge-line is as tight as it can be.

, The lean-to tarp shelter requires you to fix one edge of your tarp to your ridge-line. You can attach the tarp to the ridge-line using cord or rope and many tarps will come with grommets or loops built in. Make sure you attach the tarp to the ridge-line tightly to build a strong tarp shelter.Your tarp may have holes pre-made along its edge. If so, you can thread the ridge-line through these for an easy way to join them together.
Many tarps will have loops along the corners or edges that can be used to tie them to your ridge-line.

, Once the top edge has been tied to the ridge-line, you can secure the bottom edge of the lean-to tarp shelter. Pull the bottom edge away from the center until it is at an angle that you want. Place anchoring stakes in the ground at the corners of the tarp and tie the tarp to them. This will hold the bottom portion of your shelter securely in place.Most people recommend using a 45 degree angle for their lean-to.
Try adjusting the angle to raise or lower the height of the shelter's ""ceiling"".

Select a river.,
Select your tent.,
Select the menu.,
Plan for beverages and keep your cool.,
Prep the kitchen.,
Bring clothes and personal items.,
Choose your bedding.,
Use dry bags.,
Pack ""common"" items in a trunk.,
Bring a toilet, and shovel This is where canoe camping becomes more like backpacking, sooner or later you're going to have to take care of business and leaning against a tree or squatting simply isn't that much fun.,
Test pack your canoe the night before.,
Bring extra paddles.,
Use a motor.,
Bring a chair and table.,
Bring an umbrella.,
Wear water shoes.,
Use your imagination.",How to Go Canoe Camping," When choosing a river, it's a good idea to find one that has a reputation as a good camping river. Many rivers are unsuitable for camping as the flood plains tend to be uneven and have high riverbanks. Pick up a river guide in your area and read about the river. Easy sloped banks, sand bars, and flat level camp sites will make your trip more enjoyable.;
, The upside of camping with a canoe vs. backpacking is that it affords you the ability to take a great deal more camping equipment. The downside is you may be tempted to take too much. You should pay particular attention to your tent, a comfortable tent is very nice on the river; however, if you go too large you may have difficulty finding a place to put it. A tent between 7' and 11' (2.1 - 3.4 meters) square works pretty well. Large cabin tents may be a bit much for many sites. On the flip side, tiny tents like clip flashlights or similar lightweight hiking tents can be very cramped and tight. Try to get a self standing tent instead of one that needs to be staked down. Tent stakes don't work well in sand. Don't worry about the weight of your tent. Pick one that will give you the comfort you desire without overdoing it.

, Camping is about good food and drink. Whether you're 10 miles (16 km) back country or at a KOA, one of the great pleasures of camping is preparing and eating hearty, robust foods. Like car camping, the weight of your gear isn't that big a deal, so you'll be able to carry a cooler or two. Plan your meals in advance so you know what you'll need, you won't be able to hop in a car and run to a grocery store if you forget something. Plan each day for breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert and a few hors  d'oeuvres and snacks. Doing dishes on the river isn't fun so keeping it simple can make it more enjoyable. Some ideas may include:
A cold breakfast of cereal and Parmalat milk with toaster pastries or bagels.






Lunch: Cold sandwiches in pita or wraps






Dinner: Steak, keilbasa, or hot dogs cooked on a grill.







, Pack breakfast juice, soft drinks for the day, harder beverages for whenever. Also plan for water; some rivers contain potable water so you might be okay to take from the river, but it is always a good idea to bring drinking water and a filter pump. Try to cool anything that needs cooling before putting it in your cooler. Meats that you won't be eating on the first or second day can be frozen. A great tip for some of your water is to freeze 20oz water bottles and put them in your cooler. They keep your other stuff cool and when they melt you have drinking water. Four days is about as long as a run of the mill cooler can keep things chilled, try to find block ice, 1 or 2 blocks will last longer than ice cubes. Don't drain the water unless you're resupplying your ice or the trip is over, you'll only be replacing cold water with warm air and your ice will melt faster.

, You'll want some kind of gas stove (whether propane or white gas) for cooking vegetables, heating water for coffee or tea or just to have warm water to wash dishes. A roll up table or two and a stove stand make cooking much easier and much more enjoyable. Paper plates and bowls help keep the clean up low as they can be tossed on the fire after you've finished your meal. Bring as many paper goods as possible and only bring a cup, a coffee mug and silverware that require cleaning. For pots and pans you can bring anything you have. Bring some pots designed for camping or, if you have some, pots and pans you've retired from the kitchen. Avoid cast iron on the river as it will most likely get wet and start to rust which may ruin it. For coffee, try a manual drip coffee maker; there are many styles to choose from, some very inexpensive, which will give you a cup of coffee as good as you get from home without electricity or having to resort to 'backpacking' techniques.

, While summer camping is usually warm, you should bring extra clothes just in case. Most years you'll only need a bathing suit and T-shirt, but a pair of sweat pants and sweat shirt can really be nice if the weather turns cool.

, On the trail, it may be prudent to bring a therm-o-rest on which to lay your weary bones, but you have a canoe, so bring that queen sized air mattress and the electric pump to fill it.

, A good dry bag is best for keeping your stuff dry in rough conditions. They're specially designed to keep things dry even if submerged. Don't trust ordinary trash bags, they'll only keep it dry if it's a light rain and they are easily punctured. If the rain is severe or you dump your canoe, everything will get soaked. You'll be glad you made that $20 or so investment when you're soaked and your bedding and extra clothes are still dry.

, A dry trunk is just a plastic trunk or container of some kind into which everyone puts their ""common"" camping items. Common camping items are things like pots, pans, coffee pot, mug, cup, camp saw, stove stand, paper towels, paper plates/bowls, cutting board, knife, bug spray, matches/lighter, emergency space blanket, extra batteries, lantern mantles, sponge, camp soap, silverware, bottles of stove fuel, hiking stove etc. These are some things that you can leave in the trunk from one year to the next and know that all you have to do is pack that plus your tent, bedding and personal items and you're ready to go. You can even bring more than this, but it is the minimum for a decent camping trip. Select one that fits your canoe well and has some method of latching the top closed. If you dump, you don't want it spilling all your gear over the bottom of the river. Empty 5 gallon paint buckets (about $6 with lid at home repair centers) are a great dry place to store small items, like backpacking stoves, extra fuel, small lanterns/flashlites, charcoal, radios, etc.


Bring something that you can store all your trash in and make sure its sealable-you don't want to litter,and you don't want any sticky things spilling on you.

, A portable toilet system allows you to dig a hole in the soil, set up over it and do what needs doing. When it's time to leave, you simply pack the potty up and fill in the hole you dug. You might want to get a kit that has a nice shelter to give you privacy, but it is pricey. There are less expensive options you can choose that will work just as well, but go for a product with good durability. For a shovel, any good folding shovel will do the job.

, There are two objectives here, one is to pack efficiently so that the gear isn't sitting too high above the gunwales, the other is to balance out the canoe so it doesn't list to one side. Once you have it packed, you'll want to develop some system of tying everything into the canoe. A small tarp with criss-crossing ropes works well or just threading the rope through handles or other openings is a good idea. Anything that will keep the gear with the boat if you dump it.

, Tie extra paddles to your boat in case you go over and lose the ones you're using.

, Purists may not like this one, but an electric motor can be a lifesaver and a timesaver. This is an expensive option though, so if you're trying to go on the cheap, you may want to avoid this as you'll need the motor, a battery for the motor and registration for the canoe.

, A sling chair and accompanying table makes life on site so much more comfortable.

, For about $14 you can purchase a beach umbrella with a 6' (1.8m) spread. These are great if you need to get out of the sun or keep rain off of you. You can keep it in the boat, so if it rains while you're traveling downstream, you can throw it up quickly and stay dry. You can also use it at your campsite for the same purpose. It can also be used as a sail when there is a light breeze in the right direction.

, No matter how soft sand feels it's like sandpaper on your feet. Flip flops and sandals aren't as good, as flip flops fall off when walking in the water and sandals tend to get small stones between your foot and the sole. If the river is known to be rocky (like those in central US (Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee), you'll want water shoes with hard stiff soles, rather than flexible soles like those found on ""aqua-sock"" type shoes. What ever you use, you'll want it cover your toes and be secured on your heel. Otherwise, when wading or lining your canoe in shallow areas, a foot injury or lost shoe is likely.

, This is what makes canoe camping so much fun. You can do it very simply and bring very little, or you can bring a screen house, a self standing hammock, an 11x11 tent and everything else listed above. A river is where all the characters come out. So load up your canoe, bring something distinctive and have fun on the river.

Consider getting a stuff sack so you can pack the sleeping bag in a smaller volume.,
Stuff the bag in the stuff sack.,
Protect your bag from water.,
Pack the bag at the bottom of your pack.,
Fold the bag in half.,
Roll up the sleeping bag.,
Fit the bag into its sack.,
Wash the bag if necessary.,
Air out the sleeping bag after each trip.,
Leave it uncompressed during storage.,
Protect it from insects and water.",How to Pack a Sleeping Bag," One choice is a ""compression sack,"" which has cinch straps to further compress the bag after packing.


The minimal amount of extra weight from the sack can be worth it for the reduction in volume, and the protection against tears. However, a lot of long-distance hikers don't use a stuff sack--they just stuff the bag in their pack and let it take up empty spaces. The only reason to stuff it in a sack is to keep it contained, for convenience. Compression sacks are a good way to save space but are a little heavier than a regular stuff sack.;
, No folding, no rolling, just take one end and start stuffing it into the bag until it's all in. Starting with the foot end so it's easier to get all the air out. By ""stuffing"" it this way the insulation will stay more evenly distributed since it never gets folded the same way. If this is a compression sack, cinch the straps to tighten the bag further. Pull the cord on the stuff sack as tight as possible. The goal is to have there be an opening no larger than a quarter if at all possible.

Folding and rolling tends to cause repeated stress on the same parts, and can cause lumps in the stuffing or tears in the fabric. Folding also takes longer and makes it harder to compress.

, Keeping your sleeping bag dry is a major priority, especially for down bags. Nothing is more uncomfortable than sleeping in a wet bag on a cold night. Waterproof stuff sacks and rucksacks are one option, but they can be expensive and not always reliable. For extra protection, use a quality pack cover and line the interior of your pack with a trash compactor bag.


Bags can get wet not only from rain, but setting your backpack on the wet ground (since you often strap it to the bottom of your bag), or when crossing streams.
If you don't have a trash compactor bag, line the inside of the stuff sack with a regular garbage bag before you stuff the bag in.
Fold the top of the garbage or trash compactor bag over so that it is sealed and water won't get in. If you're using a garbage bag inside the stuff sack, twist the excess ends of the garbage bag and stick the twist under the edge of the drawstring so nothing sticks out. No need to use a twist tie. They are too easy to loose on the trail and add to trash on the trail.

, Since you won't need the sleeping bag during the day, pack it underneath everything else. This will also reduce strain on your back and knees, since the bag is lighter (by volume) than most other supplies.


If your pack has two compartments, store it at the bottom of the top compartment.
If it is not possible to fit all of your gear inside the pack, and the larger items like tent and/or sleeping bag have to be lashed on outside, strap the sleeping bag to the top of the pack and the tent to the bottom. When you take the pack off at rest stops and set it on the ground, it is preferable to have the tent instead of the sleeping bag in contact with the ground, especially if it's damp or muddy.
If you strap the bag to your backpack, be sure to try and center it on the pack as best as possible and cinch it as tight as you can. Otherwise many people end up having to stop to re-secure their bag because it is falling out.

, Fold it width-wise, so it becomes half as wide and twice as thick when rolled up. Depending on the size of your bag and stuff sack, you may need to fold it a second time.

, Start rolling at the end without straps attached. Roll the bag as tightly as you can, then pull the straps over the bundle to keep it together.


To roll it as tightly as possible, kneel with your knees on the end of the bag, rolling it against your upper leg.

, This usually is not a stuff sack, but a fitted sack that the sleeping bag can fit into when rolled up.


If you do not have a stuff sack, cinch the rolled up bag tight with a belt, or a string or rope as a last resort. You may need a friend to hold the bag while you tie it.

, If the sleeping bag gets dirty, wash it in a front-loaded washing machine. Run it through the dryer until completely dry. If you have a synthetic sleeping bag, check the tag for special instructions before you do this.


Down sleeping bags get clumpy in the wash. To make them even and fluffy again, add a tennis ball to the dryer near the end of the cycle.
Never wash a sleeping bag in a top-loaded machine. The agitator may tear the fabric.

, Never store a sleeping bag while it is wet or even a little damp. If the sleeping bag doesn't need a visit to the laundromat, just spread it out to dry instead.


Some people turn the bag inside-out and hang it so that the inside airs out (that's often what gets smelly over time).

, Storing a sleeping bag in a stuff sack may compress the material permanently (he stuffing inside can separate along where it's folded and this makes it colder and less warm to sleep in). Let it expand between trips with one of the following storage methods:


Place it in an oversize, breathable storage bag made from cotton or nylon.
Spread it out under the bed.
Hang synthetic (but not down) sleeping bags on a large clothes hanger.

, If you're storing your sleeping bag in a damp room, place it in a bone-dry, airtight tub. Keep it away from areas with a known insect problem.

"
Keep the sleeping bag dry.,
Air the bag.,
Line your sleeping bag with a bed sheet prior to sleeping in it.,
Store the bag properly.",How to Maintain a Sleeping Bag1," This is imperative number one - there is nothing more unpleasant than a night in a damp or wet sleeping bag! To ensure that it stays dry, always keep the sleeping bag in a waterproof outer bag. This is especially important if you are travelling through snow or wet areas and during wet seasons. It is also a good idea to not consume drinks near or in your sleeping bag.;
, Every morning, where possible, it is important to air the sleeping bag for at least 10 minutes. If you have sunshine, this is perfect. It will dry out any perspiration, condensation or dew that may be on the bag. If you are in a rainstorm and have a car, air the bag inside the car for a time. Alternatively, you could hang the bag up inside the tent for a morning if you are still in camp.

, This will absorb perspiration and prevent body oils from soiling it. After camping the sheet can be pulled out and washed. This tip also helps with the cleaning tips for sleeping bags because washing sleeping bags wears them out faster and can damage them. There are specific light-weight liners made for this that are not too expensive. Usually sold as ""sleeping bag liners."" An added benefit of a sleeping bag liner is ""The extra layer of material also provides for extra insulation and can increase the comfort rating of a sleeping bag by 1-2 degrees.""

, Try to place the bag in the stuff sack as randomly as possible, which randomizes the folds and creases so the filling won't develop ""flat spots"".

"
"
Store a clean and dry sleeping bag.,
Follow the instructions on the label of the washing liquid and on the label of your sleeping bag before proceeding.

,
Choose the bath method or the washing machine method.",How to Maintain a Sleeping Bag2," A dirty and/or damp sleeping bag encourages possible bacterial or mould growth and it might even make the bag more inviting to pests. There are two ways to clean a sleeping bag, one requiring more effort than the other:



Have the bag dry-cleaned. This is the easy option but often not one appreciated by outdoors enthusiasts due to the chemicals involved. If you do get the bag dry-cleaned, air it thoroughly before reuse to avoid contamination from the dry-cleaning solvents.Wash and dry the bag at home. This takes more effort but is not chemically problematic. You can purchase sleeping bag cleaning liquids (mild soaps) at camping or outdoors stores. Look for brands that are ""eco-friendly"" and check the ingredients to satisfy yourself.

,, The following provides a rough outline of how either method will proceed. Variants on this are dependent on the style/make of sleeping bag and its label instructions and on the instructions accompanying the washing liquid.

"
"
Place the sleeping bag in the bath.,
Hop in!.,
Wash. Gently move the bag around with your hands to clean.

,
Rinse.,
Remove.",How to Maintain a Sleeping Bag3," Wash one at a time, as any more makes this task cumbersome and tiring.

, With newer hydrophobic sleeping bags, you will likely have to gently stand in the bath with bare feet to squash the air bubbles down and to force the bag under the water.

,, Ensure that all the soap suds are removed. This may take several rinses. If they remain in the sleeping bag, they might react with the lofting and/or water-resistant features.

, Haul it up from the bath. Proceed to ""Drying"" steps outlined below.

"
"
Select the right washing machine.,
Keep it cool.,
Rinse.,
Keep it easy.,
Dry.",How to Maintain a Sleeping Bag4," The type of machine really matters in terms of protecting your sleeping bag:


If you choose to wash in a machine, it is recommended that a laundromat machine is probably better due to the larger space available, and look for a machine that does not have an agitator (front loader). This will keep the drawstrings and straps untangled and intact.If you only have an agitator style washing machine, prefer the bath method; the agitator may destroy your sleeping bag.

, Use a gentle, cool cycle in a washing machine.

, Include a rinse cycle.

, Spin on low only, or use the ""drip dry"" cycle and follow steps outlined under drying.

, Follow the ""Drying"" steps.

"
"
Drip dry.,
Use a dryer.,
Place in tumble dryer.,
Dry outdoors.",How to Maintain a Sleeping Bag5," Allow bag to drip dry if needed. This is more likely necessary after the Bath Method. Have a place ready for drip drying, such as a clothes horse, where water can run freely (laundry, bathroom).

, For many sleeping bags, it is possible to use a tumble dryer. While this is suitable for numerous sleeping bags, read the label carefully before you proceed.


Set the tumble dryer setting to low. See ""Warnings"".
Ensure that the bag is not still soaked (allow drip drying first).

, Tumble dry at low setting only. Check regularly and remove as soon as it has dried. Placement of one or two tennis balls can assist in ensuring even distribution of down or filling.

, If you have sunshine, dry the bag outdoors. See ""Tips"" below for more information on hand washing a sleeping bag.

"
"
Make sure the bag is dry before storing.,
Store in a large stuff sack or hanging up.",How to Maintain a Sleeping Bag6," Never store a wet sleeping bag.

, There are two main schools of thought on long-term sleeping bag storage. Both probably depend on the amount of space you have but the choice is yours:



Store your sleeping bag hanging up. If you have the space, hanging your sleeping bag is an ideal way to ensure that the feathers or fill are not being crushed at all. The best hanger is one that the bag can be folded over rather than a clip one, although both will do the job.

An alternative to hanging is to store it lying flat under a bed. Either way, the point is to let it loft out and breathe, without being exposed to weather or dirt.

Keep your sleeping bag in the larger cotton bag for storage. For those with less space, the key thing is to get your sleeping bag out of its travel stuff/compression sack, the tightness of which breaks, damages or weakens the lofting abilities of the feathers or fill. If you have an older sleeping bag, or it just didn't come with a larger storage bag, purchase one. Most camping and outdoors stores carry these. Or just use a large pillowcase.

"
"
Make a list of possible locations for your hammock.,
Choose the most appealing location.,
Create the appropriate amount of space for your hammock.",How to Buy a Hammock1," Backyards, front yards, and campgrounds are the most popular places to put a hammock, while others will even opt to use one indoors in place of a more traditional piece of furniture like a chair or couch. Weighing the pros and cons of each location will give you the best sense of where the hammock should go.;
, If you’re having trouble deciding between multiple locations, feel free to try them all out once you have the hammock in hand.

, If you ultimately decide to purchase a large, less mobile hammock, you will need a great deal of space. Something more mobile—those attached to a movable frame, for example—are usually more compact and can even be transported from one location to another with minimal effort. As a general rule, create more space than you think you’ll need; you can always make adjustments later.

"
"
Research the different types of hammock.,
Choose your preferred style of hammock.",How to Buy a Hammock2," Three standard styles exist:


The full-size open-weave rope hammock is the cheaper of the two types of full-size hammocks. It is recommended for people in warmer climates, as it provides better air circulation and is more durable in higher temperatures. As a cost-effective option, the rope hammock is probably the best bet.
The full-size fabric hammock is widely considered sturdier and more comfortable than the open-weave rope alternative. Fabric hammocks are almost always more expensive but generally last longer. Those willing to spend a little more for a higher-quality item should opt for the fabric hammock.
The hammock chair comes in both rope and fabric form. This option is ideal for those with limited space, and is much more viable as an indoor option for students or those living in bachelor apartments. It is the most affordable choice of the three, though it doesn’t allow for the same freedom and flexibility as full-sized hammocks.

, Going in with a good idea of what you want will make your search for a hammock that much easier.

"
"
Search the Internet for hammock brands and the stores that sell them.,
Read several reviews on hammock brands and retailers.,
Make the purchase.,
Complete the payment.",How to Buy a Hammock3," Using a search engine can help you locate hammock stores or shops that are willing to ship a hammock to you.
As with most purchases, you will need to be wary of a few things:


Sporting goods stores will offer a limited selection of hammocks, but these will likely be available at a lower price point than a specialty hammock shop. The trade-off is that hammock shops are far more likely to have higher-quality items that are more comfortable and durable than what you would find at other locations.
Ordering a hammock from a faraway city—or even a different country—will require paying a postage charge that could push the cost of your purchase beyond what you want to spend. Be mindful of where your search takes you, and ask yourself if you’re willing to foot the extra shipping charge.
Some hammock stores have a wide variety of rope and fabric styles, while others offer limited selection. If you’re looking for a particular style of hammock, you may need to broaden your search to include places outside your immediate area.

, With the growth of online commerce, the number of sites devoted to product and retailer reviews has also exploded. Taking the time to review a particular brand of hammock or a retailer you’re considering is a great way to provide extra peace of mind and avoid ending up with a subpar product. It’s just as important to make sure you visit several review sites rather than rely on one or two.

, Make sure you comb every bit of information provided on the site before making your final decision. Take the time to call the store directly if you don’t find all of the answers you seek.

, Online merchants often accept debit card, credit card, e-check or some alternate form of payment. Go over all of the charges before closing the purchase to make sure you aren’t being overcharged.

"
"
Scour fliers, phone books, and the Internet for local places that sell hammocks.,
Visit the store that has the hammock you want.,
Make the purchase and complete the payment.",How to Buy a Hammock4," Larger stores will likely have weekly flyers, while business listings of all sorts can be found in local phone books. Perusing the Web can also be a good way to track down nearby stores that deal in hammocks.

, If multiple stores carry the item you’re looking for, you should visit each of them to ensure you’re getting the hammock you desire at the best price. When you encounter a sales association, ask questions about quality, durability, popularity—anything that comes to mind. They’re there to help!

, Some sporting goods associates work on assistance-based commission, so if you were helped, be sure to mention his or her name to the cashier. Study the return policy on the receipt so you’ll know what to do in case you need to bring the hammock back to the store.

Recreate, in places of concentrated fauna.,
Look; there is something to eat!,
Encourage growth where you find it desirable to do so.,
Recognize that even a ""garden"" is somewhat of a concession.",How to Be a Woodland Gardener," If you try this in the city, instead of the woods, it won't be near as casual, because asparagus just doesn't naturally grow much in cities. Go figure.


This is mentioned, however, to bring up a point; plants are hardy, and life-bearing; and even right in a city, there are opportunities for ""casual harvesting"".

There are guides to resource for engaging in casual gardening within a 20 mile (32 km) radius, surely, of most cities, but they don't call them that, and you will be starting with recreating, and enjoying yourself; a day away from your cares.
If you happen to accidentally gather a mushroom, or pick a few ""I wonder if they're edibles"", so much the better, you're already ahead of the game; you can continue recreating, pretty much however you desire, and bring the I wonder's home to the book; or maybe recreating is bringing the book, for you--that works, too. Kind of an apropos word here.Some national parks have long waiting lists for camping reservations. When you have to wait a year to sleep next to a tree, something is wrong.
- George Carlin

;
, What's on the menu varies with the knowledge of the re-creator more than the season, and location, and even desire; they might be starving right next to some lifesaving starch, or uninterested in harvesting curlytenders from trees.


You are surely less than 20 miles (32 km) from this, probably less than 3; but you are taking something out of the freezer, and putting it into the microwave; eating broken food.
While the harvest will be small here, the first season, if you cultivate what you find, right where it is, you will be impressed the second year, and amazed, the third -- with a bit more cultivation in year 2.
This has to be because you are setting yourself up for success; who hasn't poured a lot of love and time into a failed veggie in a garden? (lots of people, that's who hasn't).
You may never know how many bushels you can get from completely uncultivated trees, or how delicious pickled curlytenders are; you can't buy them, for any amount of money; not even ours. You might consider that -- no amount of money for a quart of pickles?

, Casual farming, while it may sound like a failed hippie experiment, involves some cultivation; directed by the particular fauna and it's current habitat, as differentiated from it's ideal habitat; meaning, you may not wish to cultivate a particular plant in it's current spot, having knowledge of where a patch of this stuff thrives, and knowledge of a similar habitat where there happen to be none, that your ""poor castings"" could take over and thrive in, too; or more often just loosening soil in spring, minor pruning in the fall, etc. of a certain patch.
We have learned to dig a little ditch for water to get to a berry patch about 50 yards (45.7 m) from the creek every May (it always disappears by the next year). This would naturally, yet casually lend itself to some amount of work, an hour's labor, possibly (before lunch, a nap, and the last big incline).


Casual Gardening can yield a diverse, bountiful crop (the word ""crop"", to most of us now, has to do with ""images""), especially over time, and particularly over some distances, and should not be confused with gardening, which usually involves cultivation of alien seeds in a squared bed, or foraging, which is usually more intensive, but also yields more local knowledge.

, Maybe a fairly large concession. It may also be a source of great good, on many levels; as relaxation, for fulfillment, and ""fillment"".


That still does not betray the fact that concessions were made, of a nature you may not fully comprehend; or need to. Suffice it to say that, at the very least, you are planting seeds that are going to be completely unfamiliar with the soil you are putting them in; unless, of course, as is most normal nowadays, you have bought the genetically engineered seeds from a seed mill, and the fertilizer/mulch from their affiliate.More broken food.Now do you see where there might be some room here for an incidental harvest?
If a 1/4 acre garden is the most intensive use of the land, and even 1/2 of your food comes from there, you will be halfway home.You are what you eat; or at least, you were. anonymous

Check with your local wildlife agency regarding requirements for licensing certification and other requirements specifically for hunting guides.,
Gain hunting experience.,
Take hunter training classes.,
Learn outdoor survival techniques.,
Apply for jobs with outfitter companies.",How to Become a Hunting Guide,"


Each area is different, so it is important to learn what requirements you may face before becoming a hunting guide. The regulations are usually different for obtaining a hunting guide license versus just a hunting license.
Hunting guides must be hunters themselves so they should have a valid license before attempting to find a position as a hunting guide.;
,


Hunting guides should be experts in hunting whatever game they are hired to hunt. Therefore, it is a good idea to gain experience in a wide variety of game in order to guarantee more opportunities to provide services.

,


Some localities require specific training courses in order for you to get a hunting guide license. These classes may include legal issues, safety and regulations necessary to obtain hunting guide employment.

,


Often, hunting guides must spend a significant amount of time in the elements, and may be called upon to deal with emergency situations where outdoor survival is necessary.

,


An outfitter is a company that provides supplies, locations and information for hunting trips. Outfitters provide hunters with the names of hunting guides most of the time.

Fix the ground beneath the swing if you like.,
Test the swing.",How to Make a Tire Swing1," Make sure the tire is relatively clean and be sure it's still in good enough condition to not split under the weight of people .


The bigger the tire, the better, up to a point. While you want plenty of room for kids to sit in the tire, a really huge tire will be especially heavy and may weight too much for a standard tree branch. Use your good judgement about the perfect balance between size and weight for your specific branch.;
, Give your tire a good wash down with heavy duty detergent, scrubbing all of the exterior surface and rinsing the inside as well. If a dirty tire cleans up well, then it should be okay to use.


Use WD40 or a tire cleaning product to remove stubborn grease spots. People will be sitting on this tire, so the more gunk you remove, the better. Be sure to get any cleaner residue off as well!

, The tree branch itself should be thick and sturdy, around 10 inches (25cm) diameter minimum. Be sure the tree is large and healthy, with no signs of weaknesses that might indicate the tree is unstable. An isolated Maple or Oak tree usually works best.The branch you choose will impact the length of rope you'll need. Good dimensions for a tire swing branch are about 9 feet (2.7 meters) from the solid tree branch to the ground.
The branch should stick out away from the tree far enough that when you hang your tire swing off of it, the swing will not immediately hit the trunk of the tree. While you don't want to place your tire swing out at the very end of a branch, you can't attach it within a few feet of the trunk.
The higher the tree branch, the higher the tire swing will swing. So, if you are making a tire swing for a small child, you may want to chose a branch that is lower to the ground.

, Obtain about 50 feet (15.2 meters) of rope. It should be quality rope that won't fray or break when weight is applied to it.


There are a variety of ropes you can use for your tire swing, such as heavy duty climbing ropes or utility rope, but you can also use chain if you like. On a simple tire swing galvanized chain will last longer but rope is easier to handle, will potentially do less damage to the tree branch, and is easier to hold onto for kids.
As well as quality rope, fraying can be prevented by the application of tubing down the length of the rope where fraying is most likely (wherever it comes into contact with the tree, the tire, and hands).

, Since this will be left in the rain, water will accumulate inside the tire if left solid. To avoid any accumulated water, drill three holes in the tire at what will become its base.


Be careful when drilling through your tire. There may be metal strands on the inside of the tire, which you may hit with your drill bit. Just be prepared that you may hit a different layer while drilling through.

, Be sure to position the ladder safely so that you don't topple off it. Having a friend hold it steady as you climb is a wise precaution.


If you don't have a ladder, you will need to find another way of getting the rope over the branch. Find a roll of duct tape or something of equivalent weight and tie it too the end of the rope. Then throw the duct tape over the branch, so that the rope is now looped over the branch. Once the rope is looped over the branch, untie the duct tape or whatever you used as weight for the end of the rope.

, Position the rope so that it won't be rubbed by knots or imperfections on the branch. You may want to wrap the rope around the branch a few times, just to make sure it stays in place.


If you bought tubing, this part of the rope should have anti-fray tubing at either side of it (where it rests on the branch).

, (Do not use a square knot. Square knots were designed as a first-aid knot. If you pull backwards on either lose end, it will fall apart.) Make sure that the knot is solid. If you can't figure out how to make one, find someone who can.


If you have looped the rope over the branch from the ground, you will have to tie a slip knot from the ground and then tighten it up, so that it cinches up at the branch.

, Again, use a square knot to secure the rope around the top of the tire.


Before you make your knot, judge how far you would like the tire to be off the ground. The tire should clear any obstacles on the ground and should be high enough so that your child's legs don't drag on the ground, so it should be at least a foot off the ground. On the other hand, it shouldn't be so high that your child can't get into it on their own. Be sure that the tire is at this height when you secure the knot.
Remember to keep the drainage holes at the bottom, with the top of the tire opposite the side with the holes.

, Tie the tail of the rope up, so that it will not accidentally get in the way or come undone.

, Add mulch or dig over the ground to make it a softer surface for landing when jumping (or falling) off the tire swing.

, Check that the swing is sitting well for swinging. Before allowing others on the swing, test your handiwork with a spotter nearby in case anything goes wrong. If it works well, you, and your kids, are ready to start swinging.

Check that the swing is sitting well for swinging.",How to Make a Tire Swing2," It will need to be relatively clean and in good enough condition so that the side walls will not split under weight.


You can choose whatever size tire you like but remember that huge tires can weigh a lot. You do want plenty of room for several kids to sit in the tire, a very large tire may weight too much for a standard tree branch.

, Give it a good wash down with heavy duty detergent, scrubbing it inside and out.


You can also use a tire cleaning product to clean your tire.

, It should be thick and sturdy, about 10 inches diameter and 9 feet from the ground.


Be sure the tree is large and healthy, with no signs to indicate that the tree is unstable or dead inside.
Make sure that the point of attachment for your swing is far enough away from the trunk that the swing will not easily hit the trunk. This means that you need to attach your swing at least a few feet out from the trunk.
The distance between the branch and the tire also dictates how high it will swing. The longer the rope, the higher your swing will go, so you may want to chose a branch that is lower to the ground if you are making a swing for a small child.

, You will need to purchase three ""u-bolts,"" with two matching washers and nuts for each side of the bolt. In other words, you will need to have four washers and four nuts for each u-bolt. In addition you will need to obtain about 10 feet of rope, 20 feet of good galvanized chain, and an ""s"" hook large enough to have the end of three pieces of your chain hooked into one end of it.It should be quality rope that won't fray or break when weight is applied to it. There are a variety of ropes you can use for your tire swing, such as heavy duty climbing ropes or utility rope.
Instead of a s-hook you can use a carabiner, connector link, or a locking swivel hook. These alternative give you the option of easily taking the swing down but will cost you a little bit more money.The chain does not need to be a huge gauge. When you purchase it, check the weight rating for the chain you intend to get. Make sure the rating is for enough weight that it will hold up a third of the weight of a few kids. It only needs to hold a third of the weight because you will have three chains to dissipate the weight.
Fraying of rope can be prevented by putting tubing around it wherever it comes into contact with the tree.

, This side will be the bottom of the swing. The holes will make sure that any water collecting on the inside of the tire due to rain will easily drain out.


Be careful when drilling the holes through your tire. There may be metal strands on the inside of the tire that you will need to drill through.

, Be sure to place it safely, so that it is on solid ground.


Have a friend hold the ladder steady if you have one helping you out.

, Encircle the branch several times before tying it off with a square knot.You will need to hook the s-hook onto the rope, at the bottom of the branch. Close it around the rope, so that the rope will not be able to slip out of the hook.
Make sure that the knot is solid. If you can't figure out how to make one, find someone who can.

, You will need to determine the length by deciding at what height you want to tire to hang. Measure down from the s-hook to the position you would like the top of the tire. This will be the length of each of your chain pieces.


The tire should be high enough so that your child's legs don't drag, so it should be at least a foot off the ground. However, it shouldn't be too high, so that kids can't get in and out of it on their own.

, Close the s-hook, by clamping it closed with some pliers, so that none of the pieces of chain can come out.

, Be sure you have them spaced equally around the top sidewall of the tire before drilling holes for each end of the u-bolt to go through the sidewall.


You will want to position the u-bolts so that they are near the outside edge of the tire, running along the circle of the tire, not across it. The outside edge of the sidewall is the stronger part of it and will assure that the tire is not misshapen when it's hanging.
Remember to keep the drainage holes at the bottom, with the top of the tire where you are attaching the u-bolts opposite the side with the holes.

, Make sure the chain is not twisted up at the top.

, Have someone help hold it up, so that you can attach the u-bolts. Place one nut and washer on each side of the bolt before sticking them through the holes toward the inside of the tire. Then attach a washer and nut onto the threads on the inside of the tire, so that the sidewall of the tire is sandwiched between the two washers and nuts.


If you don't have a helper, simply place the tire on something that raises it up high enough to get the u-bolts attached. If the tire you used is excessively heavy, this may be a good idea whether you have a helper or not.

, Test your handiwork with a spotter nearby in case anything goes wrong before allowing others to use it. If all goes well, let the kids start playing on it right away!

Determine your ultimate goals as a cyclist.,
Try interval training to build endurance and strength quickly.,
Seek out the hills.,
Ride your first century, or 100-mile ride.,
Ride 4-5 times a week.,
Create a training schedule to maximize your workouts.",How to Become a Better Cyclist1," Are you looking to improve up hills? Do you want to compete in races? Do you want to ride longer distances? Knowing your end goals will help you make a specific training program, which will cut into your weaknesses much faster than just going out and riding randomly. For example:


If you want to be a better climber, you need to design rides/routes that feature a lot of elevation change.
If you want to compete in a race, you need to build your overall speed and strength, favoring shorter, but faster, rides and minute adjustments meant to shave off seconds.
If you want to ride for longer, you need to slowly build up your endurance, increasing your mileage each week.;
, Endurance training is when you push yourself nearly to the max for 1-2 minutes, then slow down to rest for 1-2 minutes. By repeating this multiple times, you train your heart and body to push itself and then recover quickly, which translates into better overall cycling. While there are hundreds of interval routines out there, start out simple:


Warm up at a slow, even pace for 10-15 minutes.
Push yourself for 1 minutes at 80-90% top speed.
Relax to a slow, even pace for 2 minutes.
Repeat 5 more times.
Cool down for 10-15 minutes at a slow, even pace.
As you improve, lower your rest time by 15 seconds each ride., Hills may not be fun in the moment, but they are nature's way of whipping you into shape. Focus on hill riding 2-3 times a week, and push yourself up them. You can even time yourself up hills you tackle commonly, then race against your best times as you get stronger.


Try cranking up hills one gear higher than you normally would, and stay seated throughout. You'll go slower, but the training will be incredible., The century is more than a rite of passage, it is a great way to train your body for longer, more grueling rides. That said, there is a wide variety of ways to conquer a century, from all-out pushes to slower rides with frequent stops for food and stretching. No matter your speed, a century ride will push your mentally and physically into a better rider, making your next 20-mile loop feel like a breeze., At the end of the day, the only guaranteed way to become a better cyclist is to get out and ride every week. No matter where you go, or the speed you go, the more miles you log the faster you will be. Even riding to and from work, however short, will help you make slight gains.


Mix up your routes -- this not only keeps riding interesting, it presents new kinds of challenges and terrain.
Time yourself or get a bike computer for detailed information on your average speed, time, and miles covered.
Join group rides or ride with friends for added incentive. Try and find riders that challenge you to go faster and get stronger., Having a schedule makes it easier to stick to your goals and get the most out of your rides. The schedule does not have to be super complex, and there are only a few rules that you need to abide by:


Schedule two days in between major or difficult rides, like interval training or an extra-hilly day. Your legs need time to recover.
Give yourself 1-2 long, slow rides. This builds overall endurance and helps your legs stay loose and.
Ramp up the total mileage by 10-12 miles each week if you're training for longer rides.
Log each ride, time, and mileage to track your improvement."
"
Always do a pre-ride checklist to spot potential problems before they ruin a ride.,
Keep your pedal speed consistent to learn proper shifting.,
Descend fearlessly to maintain speed.,
Pace yourself wisely up climbs.,
Pay attention to your front wheel on group rides.,
Drink and eat like a pro by refueling while your ride.",How to Become a Better Cyclist2," A simple once-over on your bike should be enough. You should always be prepared for long rides with food, water, and a spare tube. If you don't know how to change a tire, practice one in the safety of your garage before heading out. Right before you get on your bike, check out:



Wheels: Push your tires-- they should be firm. Grip the spokes and make sure they don't bend or feel loose. Spin them and make sure they don't rub against the brakes.

Chain: Rub it with your finger -- a small amount of oil should come off. If not, you should clean and lube your chain.


Brakes: Spin a wheel, then pull the brakes, making sure they stop the wheel instantly., In a perfect world, your feet will be moving at the exact same speed the entire ride, making the same number of revolutions per minute (RPMs) for the entire ride. While this isn't practical, nor advisable in a race, the general principle is the same -- you want to shift so that your feet keep moving freely, not speeding up and slowing down constantly. You'll save energy and keep a more consistent, even pace this way, which is essential over long rides.


You want to aim for 80-90 RPM, meaning your foot makes one and a half full rotations every second.
You want to shift before a hill gets difficult, shifting slowly so that your feet can keep moving at the same pace., Learning to descend a hill safely, but quickly, is essential to conserve momentum and shave minutes off of your time. Keep your body loose and relaxed to react quickly to turns or potholes. Grab the drop bars to decrease air resistance. If there are no turns coming, avoid braking -- you'll just lose speed you have to pedal to get back. If there is a turn:


Brake to your comfortable speed before the turn comes -- you don't want to be slowing down as you hit it.
Shift into a middle gear -- easy enough to pedal quickly but hard enough that you get some speed on the way out of the turn.
Put some weight on the outside pedal (it should be down) and lean your body slightly into the turn. If you're nervous, practice this skill on flat turns first.
Stand up and pedal hard out of the turn for 3-4 seconds to regain speed, then lower back to the drop bars., You want to shift before the climb, just as it is getting difficult, to keep your legs pumping at an even, maintainable speed. You'll likely drop some RPMs, ending up around 70-80, but the goal is a consistent speed that doesn't immediately tire you out. You have the low gears for a reason -- you'll be faster sticking to one of them than trying to slog up in a heavy gear and shift later on.There is nothing wrong with standing at the end of a climb -- it shifts the muscles you're using for a quick burst of power. Standing, however, is much more intense on your lungs than seated riding, so save it for the last push of the hill.

, Riding in a pack is a skill by itself, but all it really requires is careful attention. Only ride as close to another rider as you feel comfortable. On hills, either up or down, spread out into smaller clumps of 2-3 riders, minimizing the chance for massive, dramatic pile-ups.


Always pay attention to your front wheel. If you want to chat and enjoy the scenery, give some distance or ride side-by-side.
If you're near the front of a group, call out any potholes, sticks, or broken glass in advance and point out its location. Many riders behind you, especially those focused on your back wheel, won't see the dangers until it is too late if you aren't vocal., ""Bonking,"" is the not-so-technical term for running out of energy mid-ride, and it hits many riders who don't come prepared. In general, you should have a full water bottle for every hour you're riding, and you should have some sort of snack if you plan on going longer than an hour and a half. If you're doing a long ride, have a some food once or twice every hour and stop at gas stations to refill your bottles. Something with quick sugars, a little bit of protein, and a very little far is perfect, and sports drinks make good substitutes for shorter rides. Good, portable choices include:


Apples and bananas.
PBJ sandwich
Bag of low-sugar cereal or granola.
Packet of Fig Newtons, crackers, or pretzels.
Energy bars, gels, and beans."

Work your hamstrings.,
Work your back for better stability and safety in the event of a crash.,
Work out your butt muscles for more standing power up hills.",How to Become a Better Cyclist3," Your thighs are your pistons when riding. If you're going to build muscle outside of riding, this is the place to start. Try out:


Squats
Leg press
Agility ladder drills.

, Your core is where you transfer energy from your upper body to lower, and how you keep balanced. A strong core allows you to expend your energy only from your legs, minimizing wasteful rocking movements and keeping you moving forward. Incorporate:


2-300 crunches every other day.
3 1-minute planks, on each side.
Perform yoga.

Ball and machine exercises., The hamstring/quad combo is the source of most of your cycling power. While quads build easily while riding, many professional riders find that dedicated hamstring workouts translate to better rides and faster splits. To build your hamstrings up, try:


Leg curls
Cleans

Box jumps and plyometrics., Back exercises also target many core muscles, and will make you a better athlete overall. Try out:


Pull-ups
Deadlifts
Seated rows.

Procure aircraft cable and specialty hardware.,
Make a loop on each end of each cable using the cable clamps.,
Drill a ¼ inch (6.35mm) hole through one end of each tube, about 2 inches (5cm) from the end.,
Screw 6-inch (15cm) or longer lag bolts into the ground about 8 to 12 feet apart (points C and D in the drawing).,
Screw in one of the 10-inch lag bolts at point A in the drawing.,
Removing the nuts from one of the cable clamps, make a loop at about the midpoint of the first aircraft cable, just big enough to fit over the pole.,
Screw in a 10-inch (25cm) lag bolt at point B, securing the first pole.,
Repeat the previous three steps for points D, E, and F, using the second piece of aircraft cable.

,
Mount your hammock, using two half hitches at point C, and a taut-line hitch at point D. Slide the hitch until the hammock rope is very tight.

,
Sit in the middle of the hammock, and make sure your bottom doesn't hit the ground.,
With the working end of the taut-line hitch, tie another two (or more) half hitches around the cable, in case the wind lifts the hammock off the poles while you're not in it.,
Enjoy sleeping in your hammock as long as you stay in this location.",How to Pitch a Hammock without Trees," Have a hardware store cut you two pieces of an inch (1.5mm) aircraft cable, each at least twenty feet long. Buy at least six (6) 1/16 inch (1.5mm) cable clamps while you're there, along with four (4) ½ inch (1.27cm) by 10 inch (25cm) lag bolts and two shorter lag bolts not less than 6 inches (15cm) long. Two pieces of one inch (2.5cm) round or square aluminum tubing, at least 4 feet (1.2 meters) long, are necessary also. If you don't have an assortment of hardware at home, buy two ¼-20 x 2"" (6.35mm x 5cm) bolts and Mylock nuts, or two ¼x2"" (6.35mm x 5cm) hitch (or clevis) pins with hitch pin clips.;
, Three clamps for each loop are recommended for safety, but for reasons explained below, this overkill should not be necessary.

, Through each of these holes, insert a bolt with locknut, or a clevis pin with a hitch pin clip.

, Leave only about ½ inch (1.27cm) sticking out of the ground. The poles go over the heads of the bolts, and they keep the base of the poles from shifting position.


It is quickest to use a ratcheting socket wrench for this operation.

, The distance, assuming 20-foot (6 meter) cables and 4-foot (1.2 meter) poles, would be about 9 feet (2.7 meters) from point C.

, Holding the pole upright, slide the loop so that the cable between points A and C is very tight. Screw the nuts back on tight.

, Have a friend hold the pole plumb and upright if possible while locating point B, otherwise use stones or some other means to make sure the pole is (close to) perfectly upright when the anchoring cable is tight.

,,, If it does, adjust the taut-line hitch at point D. Practically speaking, there will be some stretch in the rope and fabric which will necessitate performing this step three or more times until everything is tight. If there is no more ""take-up"" room on the side with the taut-line hitch, loosen it; undo the two half-hitches at point C; and re-tie them closer to the hammock. Then you will have more room for adjustments. Ideally you will be only an inch or two above the ground when the setup is complete, meaning only a slight impact if something breaks or a lag bolt pops out of the ground.

, Otherwise you'll be chasing it across the desert, then finally extracting it from a cactus or mesquite bush.

Note: There is no need to remove the cable clamps when you break camp. The bolts or clevis pins may also be left in the poles; so the only thing necessary to do is remove the lag bolts and pack everything up.

Know how to run the boat and back a trailer.",How to Be a Non Boater at a Pro Am Bass Tournament," After the names are drawn for partners, be sure to ask your pro what time he wants to meet in the morning, and where you should meet him.;
, When you meet your pro after the draw, ask him what you should be prepared for. If he says you'll be throwing spinnerbaits all day, don't bother to bring your finesse gear. Two or three rods and a tackle box are plenty.

, He wants you to catch fish, since any you add to the live well increase his weight, too. If it's not shared weight, then consider it an opportunity to watch and learn. Any fish you catch will be a bonus.

, Plus, it's his boat. Don't get uppity.

,, Every circuit has minor variations. Maybe you aren't allowed to net for your partner or something. Read the rules.

,,, Keep your casts behind an invisible line that cuts the boat in half.

,, If he asks you not to fish a certain spot, you should probably go along with him. But if he tells you he doesn't want you to fish at all, you can tell him to go pound sand.

, Never, ever tell any other angler what your pro was doing or where he was fishing on the first day, even if they ask (which is a major breach of etiquette). After the tournament is over with, you can tell your buddies, but until the checks are distributed, mums the word.

, He'll probably ask you to back him in before the tournament, then go up and get the trailer afterwards.

Do your homework.,
Know when the fish will be tastiest.,
Prepare the right shelter.,
Prepare the fishing hole.,
Obtain a comfortable seat.,
Use a skimmer to keep the hole clear of the ice and slush that forms during the day.,
Have a storage container.",How to Begin Ice Fishing (USA)," Check with your local Ministry of Natural Resources Publications of wildlife agency to see which fish is in season and in what location. Most anywhere where the ice freezes for a while is a good place to fish.;
, Ice fishing is best during cold winters when the flesh of the fish is warm and flaky. The fish tastes the best during this time because you stay away from muddy flavored fish that you may catch from fishing during the summer.

, It is important when ice fishing that you have an ice hut. This will keep you warm when the weather is windy and the hut will allow you to stay out fishing longer. Additionally, the hut will also protect you from the sun when it becomes bright and blinding. You can purchase an ice hut at any fishing store or if you have the time and patience, you can build one on your own.

, Once you find the perfect fishing spot, drill a large hole completely through the ice until you can see open water. Then, get out the ice chisel to widen your hole. Unpack your ice hut or equipment and take out your rods to catch the fish.

, You will probably need to sit on a portable seat so that you can look directly through the hole to see what's happening. Make sure it is sturdy and comfortable.

, Once your line is set, you'll need to keep a close eye on it or watch for the flag on the tip-up to see if you've caught a fish.

, Keep a cooler to store the fish in once caught. The pleasure of ice fishing is being in the great outdoors, plus you have fresh fish to take home to eat.

Stay in academia.",How to Become an Adventurer," An adventurer is typically someone who seeks out unusual and uncommon situations. If you want to make a career out of adventuring, how you choose to define ""adventure"" will shape the plans, methods, destinations, meanings and purpose of your career.


Wanting to be an adventurer doesn't necessarily mean you have to embrace rock climbing if you're interested in the toads of the Amazon. Channel your interests into an adventurous career, and choose something personally fulfilling and meaningful.;
, Were you the kind of kid who had to be dragged inside for dinner? Who picked handfuls of dandelions and daisies? Who loved the poetry of nature? Did you escape to the woods every chance you got? Maybe you love taking early morning swims in the cool chill of a lake.


If the idea of hiking in the mountains among clear streams fills you with tranquility and not a panicky desire for antihistamine, adventure for you might consist of wildlife conservation, eco-tourism, or scenic recreation.

, Were you a tree-climber and a daredevil? A skinner-of-knees? The first to volunteer in gym and the last to back down? Always on the move, maybe you feel cooped up while sitting in class. Maybe the idea of working at a computer in a drab office fills you with nameless dread. Maybe you have no fear of riding your bicycle fast in heavy traffic and think scuba diving sounds like a relaxing weekend activity. White water? Bring it on.


For you, adventure might consist of extreme sports, outdoor endurance activities, or exploration.

, Does discovering new music, trying new food, and being lost in an unfamiliar land seem exciting to you? Maybe the history of a place interests you. Maybe you've always wanted to learn Japanese, see what Siberia looks like from a train, or spend the day sipping red wine and sampling goat cheeses.


For you, adventure might be archaeological research or journalism. It might be culinary, historical, or artistic. Also consider anthropology and sociology, if you've an aptitude for research.

, If there was an injured rabbit in your backyard when you were a kid, you took it in a shoebox and cared for it. Do you always keep up with the news abroad? Does poverty fill you will a sense of injustice and a desire to create change? Do you want to give back to the world and contribute your talents in a way that makes it a better place than you found it?


Humanitarian and philanthropic adventures are right up your alley. Consider legal or medical fields.

, Are you fascinated by animals--their names, their classifications, their different peculiarities? Have you always kept pets? Maybe you've always had an unexplainable fascination with rocks? Volcanoes set your mind awhirl. You could name all the dinosaurs when you were a kid. Never afraid to pick up frogs or touch snakes, maybe you always felt at home with other species.


Scientific research adventures are for you. Consider biology, zoology, paleontology, or geology as potential fields.

, The life of an archaeologist seems glamorous in Indiana Jones, but that's because there are no scenes of him revising 30-page research articles about tertiary religious ceremonies in ancient Sumeria for an editing review with an academic journal so he can get tenure. Before you go off digging African velociraptors, you have to lay the ground work for success. There's no way to ""major in Adventure,"" but you can study something that will allow you to travel and give you the foundations for doing what you want.If you're interested in scientific adventures, study biology or other related life sciences. Chemistry will keep you in the lab and on the computer, while marine biology will get you into the field.
If you're interested in travel, hospitality and tourism programs would be a smart investment. Study a foreign language as an added bonus in marketing yourself down the road.
If you're interested in outdoor sports or other activities that involve being in nature, ecology programs with all sorts of specialities are available all over the country. Talk to an academic advisor to find out what's right for you.
After graduating, you can apply for Fulbright Fellowship or other grant program to fund a research or teaching experience in another country. They field all manner of different project ideas, from teaching music forms in Russia to poetry in South America.
If college isn't in the cards for you, never fear. Keeping yourself informed about your intended adventurous field doesn't necessarily need to be any more complicated than getting a library card and doing the work yourself. Developing a good set of skills, like videography or photography can likewise be a particularly useful skill. Someone needs to know how to operate those high-definition video cameras in the arctic. Why not you?

, One great way to have a guaranteed and semi-organized experience abroad for up to two years is to sign up for the Peace Corps.This can be a good way to pay back student loans, develop the skills necessary to travel, and build connections in other places. It's also an extremely satisfying way to give back, as you'll be participating in humanitarian aid of the most necessary sort.


Combine Peace Corps work with your own side travels over the course of your time there to make the most of it. Take a weekend to jaunt up to the Mediterranean and explore the cuisine, or to check out the scenic Scandinavian hiking trails. It'll leave you rejuvenated and ready to get back to the hard work you'll be doing.

, In Europe, it's common for young and unemployed women to work abroad in the childcare industry. It can be a fairly lucrative short-term opportunity, giving you the chance to immerse yourself in a new culture and make some money.


Staying in close quarters with a family is a great way to learn the culture and language, too, as well as building a long-term relationship with a family that you can follow up on later in your adventuring career. If you work in Germany with a family for a year, that's one friendly group of folks you'll always know when you're passing through with a backpack and need a warm place to sleep.

, English skills are in demand worldwide. In Southeast Asia, especially, the demand for English teachers is on the rise. Most programs that facilitate your teaching experience, hooking you up with a job and the necessary qualifications, will require a BA in any field, but not all. You might be able to find a gig teaching private lessons yourself, but an organization that specializes in placing American teachers in positions abroad is the safest and easiest way to go about getting a gig.

, If you've got the time and the resources, your church or you school may organize yearly trips abroad that will give you some of the flavor of the kind of adventure you seek. Even if it's only for a couple weeks and even if the work is hard, building houses in Guatemala or Peru, you're earning your way and building the necessary skills. Any adventurous job you'll apply for down the road will look on this kind of experience warmly.


This can be especially great for anyone with an interest in humanitarian work, though you'll be at the mercy of a travel group, which may end up on the touristy side of things. Plan side trips and create your own fun.

, Just go. Couch surfing organizations and opportunities on organic farms are available for anyone who has the time to invest.This will give you experience traveling, living in another culture, and the support net available might develop into a long term opportunity you'd never have known about otherwise. Even if it's a couple of weeks to take a bike trip from Minnesota to New Orleans, you're laying the foundation for future stories and successes by just getting out and going.


When you get back from your adventure, use the experience as an ""in"" for getting a job. now that you've got DIY experience, you're a much more marketable adventurer., Recreation workers, trail guides, scuba instructors all have salaried positions you can get with the proper experience and certifications. The experience you've gleaned from traveling abroad, adventuring on your own, or studying in your desired field should open up a variety of options doing the type of thing you want to do. Get a job with the state at your favorite park, or start your own business teaching kayaking lessons.


If you're getting paid to teach other people about what you love, every day can be an adventure. Get a job at a ski resort teaching snowboarding lessons, or work your way up at an aquarium. You don't necessarily have to be a marine biologist to work with animals.

, If adventures are what you love, getting someone else to pay for your mushroom-gathering expedition to France or your next snowboarding trip to Switzerland is the dream.


National Geographic provides a variety of funding for research proposals, from the media-driven to the hypothesis-driven.Explore your funding options on a trip-by-trip basis and work on publishing or selling the results when you return. If you write a best-selling book about your cross-country train journey that was paid for in the first place, you're in great shape.

, Write about your adventures. Consider updating people about your adventurous experiences via a blog, websites, or other social media networks. Film your exploits. The best way to get other people interested in your adventures and to get your name out there as an adventurer in need of funding is to market yourself and your particular set of talents.


Selling freelance photography or your videos is one of the best ways to get a foot in the door for a full time job with a publication or media service.Got great pictures of the great horned owls you saw on a hike? Try sending them to magazines. If you've got a great story about your time in Istanbul that needs to be told, try to get it published. If it's marketable, you may get a job offer.

, If being in Australia is an adventure for you, then whatever you're doing when you're there is adventurous, and will allow you to explore on your own in your own neighborhood. Get a job leading sightseeing tours or doing manual labor in a place you love and work for the weekend.


Many agricultural areas will hire seasonal labor, picking fruit, pruning grape vines, or doing other outdoor work. It can be challenging and low-paying, but if it allows you to move around, pack up, and leave on a regular basis, it may satisfy those adventurers with wanderlust.

, Jobs that require travel, like salesmen, activity coordinators, musicians, or migrant laborers will ensure that you're constantly on the move and that every new day of work will yield and exciting and new experience.


Alternatively, try getting a job that you can do from anywhere. Telecommuting work, like copy editing, programming, and other online jobs will allow you the ability to work from home, from abroad, or from wherever you like. Gather together as many opportunities as possible and make your own hours.

, While a large portion of the year will be devoted to on campus and in-class work, there are a variety of research positions available that will provide you with ample opportunity to get into the field on salary, the opportunity for sabbatical trips, and the necessary support to do the work that you want to do, whatever it is. If you need to be at the Tower of London to do research for your next historical novel, the support of a university is one of the best chances you're going to get.

Research specific guidelines for your area.,
Obtain a coast guard license.,
Become certified in CPR and first aid.,
Obtain business insurance.",How to Become a Fishing Guide1," Each state has different qualifications for becoming a fishing guide. Contact your state's Division of Fish and Wildlife and/or Department of Law Enforcement to determine the proper requirements for your specific state. If you don’t live in the United States, check with your country’s guidelines.Some state requirements are rather rigorous, while others are more lax.
Many states require guides to have a coast guard license, CPR certification, and insurance.;
, A coast guard license (also called a Merchant Mariner Credential, or MCC) is required if you plan to take passengers on a motorized boat. This is a meticulous process with several steps.You will need to:

Submit an application at a Regional Exam Center or through the mail
Verify that you've spent 360 days (8 hours = 1 day) on a boat (90 within the last year)
Present 3 notarized letters of recommendation
Pass a background check (and provide finger prints)
Pass a written test (120 multiple choice questions)
Pay a fee (around $300)

, Many states require this for a fishing guide business. A guide must be able to demonstrate that they are able to handle at least general water and health emergencies. Take a course through your local Red Cross or community college.If you have been previously certified, make sure it is still valid.

, Many states will require you to carry a minimum of $1 million dollars in business insurance. Insurance is a safeguard against those unforeseen accidents or incidents that might occur on a boat or in the outdoors. Contact a local insurance company and inquire about business insurance."

Start small.,
Join a fishing club.,
Learn to master a species.,
Sign up for a small tournament.,
Find a professional fisherman.,
Get endorsements.",How to Become a Professional Fisherman," If you are new to fishing, you will want to fish local ponds, rivers, lakes or streams with which you are familiar. You need to learn the basic elements of fishing such as how to tie a lure and bait a hook. You can only do this through practice.;
, Fishing clubs are a great way to meet others close to your skill level and above. The individuals in the clubs will have tips, techniques and will turn you on toward the bite. They often hold their own small tournaments.

, Different types of fish require different types of fishing techniques. It is difficult to be successful at them all without mastering a few.


Certain species like certain baits. Don't fall into the trap of using catfish baits on bass, for example. There are thousands of manufacturers that make a wide variety of bass baits. Even the same bait in a slightly different color pattern can make all the difference.






Many fishermen make the mistake of not understanding the importance of fishing line selection. Don't skimp on quality for a cheaper price.







, Almost every area of the country, no matter how large or small, has a body of water that is inhabited by one or a few predominant species. Master the art of fishing for these species. Sooner or later, there will be a small tournament for these that are your specialty.


You will need some small tournament wins in order to qualify for the top dollar tournaments.






You will learn from more experienced tournament contestants and this knowledge will eventually give you an edge in your future career endeavors.







, Most professional fishing tournaments use a pro-am type of field. There are normally two men to a single boat. The boat owner is the professional and is fishing for the big bucks. The co-angler is the amateur, or the inexperienced professional, that is fishing for the smaller, alternate purse. Many times, the alternate purse includes a boat and possibly a truck to pull it.

, You will need to get some endorsements in order to make your career as a professional fisherman lucrative. Tournament wins are nice, but you can easily spend as much on the quality equipment you need as you will win in any given tournament. Once you are endorsed, your name becomes viral and that is the true sign of a professional fisherman.


The fastest way to get endorsements is to market yourself to local bait and tackle stores in your area. These will not likely amount to much cash in hand, but if you adorn yourself and your boat with advertising stickers, these places might give you free equipment, if not money.






You will have to win many local tournaments, and at least one major, to get the lucrative endorsements from the major brands and outlets. The more tournaments you win, the more the local shops will be willing to endorse you as well.

Release baby minnows.",How to Bait and Use a Minnow Trap," Many commercial traps come in a torpedo shape. These traps have funnel openings at each end. You can modify the trap by using pliers or string or plastic ties to close one end so there’s only one entrance and exit for the minnows and their bait., Your trap will likely have a door you can slide open or a latch that hooks together two sides of the trap. Undo the latch and separate the halves for easy access while placing bait and attractants.

, Light is attractive to fish and can be used to bring more minnows to your trap. Use plastic ties or a length of string to suspend the glowstick from the inside of the trap. Be sure to knot the string around the cage and the glow stick to keep it in place. Suspend the glow stick over your bait.Many commercial traps now come in a silver color. These help attract minnows, making the glow stick all the more optional.

, Various household items serve as good bait for minnows. Peanut butter, bread, crackers, live insects, and cat and dog food are all examples of cheap bait that spread from the trap. The food can be stuffed through one of the funnel ends, laid in the trap, or wrapped in a porous material first such as pantyhose or cheese cloth so it doesn’t float away.A can of tuna with holes poked in it works too and can be used a couple of times.
If you are going to position your trap in a current, you can pack the outside of the funnel end you closed with a bait such as cat food. The minnows will come upstream when they smell the food and swim into the trap’s open end.

, Remember that minnows live near the surface. They congregate near the shore under debris such as rocks and tree roots and feed during the day. Search your fishing area for minnows swimming in shallow streams or other areas where you’ll be able to leave your trap for a couple of hours at the very least.


Choosing an area with a current can help since minnows downstream will smell the bait, but minnow trapping can be done in still water.

, Attach several feet of string to the trap, long enough so that you can secure the trap while it is submerged. Knot the rope or string around an object such as a dock, a rock, or a wooden stake. Later on, you’ll be able to pull up the trap without having to wade in after it.Choose inconspicuous black wire so no one finds and steals your catch.
Rocks can also be placed inside the trap to help weigh it down.

, In still water, it’s necessary to orient the trap to where the minnows live. Once you’ve found debris, move the trap as close as you can to the shaded area. Point the open end towards the shore, rocks, and tree roots. When the minnows smell the bait, they’ll go into the trap.Traps in a current also benefit from being near the shore.

, If your location has a current, face the open end of the trap downstream instead of to the shore. Whether you have spread your bait on the outside or placed it in the cage, the current will carry the smell away, causing the minnows to swim towards the inside of the trap., Often you’ll see minnows going into your trap right away. Come back in several hours though when the bait has gone and the trap has filled. When using more protected bait such as tuna in a can, you can come back in a day or two since the minnows won’t be able to eat it.

, Now that you have minnows in your trap, bring the trap back to the shore. Open the trap. Dump the minnows in a bucket of water, making sure you keep the water aerated if you plan on keeping them there for longer amounts of time., Consider releasing young, small minnows along with any other minnows you don’t plan on using. Keep the minnow population sustainable so that not only others fishing can catch minnows, but other fish have minnows to eat.Live fish should only be released where you caught them. Moving fish impacts ecosystems by depleting fish populations and introducing invasive species.

Determine whether your rod and reel really need to be balanced.,
Try a number of rod-and-reel combinations before you buy.,
Add additional weight to the butt end of your rod handle to improve balance.",How to Balance a Fishing Rod,"


Rigs using moving-bait presentations don't need to be balanced because they are fished tip down. A balanced rig is more important when fishing with still-presentation lures, like worms and jigs.
These baits are fished with the rod tip at a 10 o'clock position. A balanced fishing rod keeps the angler's hands in a relaxed position that allows them to detect small changes in line tension. It also reduces fatigue from hours of casting and holding the rig upright.;
,


Beginners may outfit their fishing pole with a spincast reel, because they are easiest to use. Baitcast reels provide fishermen with better casting accuracy and are powerful enough to drag heavy lures through underwater vegetation. Both types mount on the top of the rod, in the reel seat. Make sure your rod is designed for these types of reels to ensure proper balance.
Spinning reels mount under the rod and must be matched with specially designed spinning rods for optimum effectiveness.
When you've matched your rod and reel, test the rig's balance. If you have a spincast or baitcast set-up, try to balance it horizontally on your index finger. Place your finger along the underside of the rod, just in front of the reel. If the tip edges downward, the rod is too heavy for the reel. If the handle tips downward, choose a lighter reel to achieve optimum balance.
If you're testing a spinning rod for balance, try to hold it with your index finger right where the reel is seated in the rod. If the set-up is neutral, the rod should hold a horizontal plane while you're holding it.
Few set-ups will have perfect balance. The key is to find a combination that doesn't quickly tip in one direction or the other when you're trying to balance it on your finger.

,


Some anglers put a weighted cap on their rod handle to move the balance point away from the rig down to the handle.
A bottom-heavy rod allows a fisherman to propel heavier baits farther and also reduces arm strain due to repetitive casting. Manufacturers say the ""zero-weight"" balance provided by the weighted caps also improve rod sensitivity, enabling fishermen to feel even sight change in the line tension.

Advertise in local and online publications.,
Contact local businesses.,
Hold free or low-cost clinics.",How to Become a Fishing Guide2," If there are local publications that focus on tourism, and/our outdoor recreation, look into purchasing advertising space there. Local weekly entertainment magazines are an excellent choice as well. Any online publication that focuses on outdoor adventure might be a good place to advertise, too.


You might consider creating a website for your business or an online blog for sharing tips as well as marketing your services., Speak to local business owners and find out if they are willing to help advertise your business. You can provide them with posters, business cards, and other promotional materials.Contact hotels, resorts, and dude ranches.

Decide if you are a ""people person."",
Realize you won't actually be fishing.,
Look at your finances.",How to Become a Fishing Guide3," Knowing how to catch fish is an important component of being a fishing guide, but it isn't the most important requirement. Instead, knowing how to interact with people, and being able to stay patient with people as they learn to fish is #1. Consider how much you enjoy people. Are you charismatic and patient? Are you a good teacher and communicator? If so, you might make a great guide., Many people turn to guiding because they love to fish. Unfortunately, many guides never even pick up a rod during outings. Rather than catching fish for yourself, your sole responsibility will be helping others catch fish. Understanding this before you begin your guiding journey will help you become a better guide., It can take 3-4 years to establish yourself as a successful fishing guide. Additionally, during those first few years, you may need to invest in equipment. Look a good look at your finances and decide if you have the resources to start your own business. Consider starting your career as a fishing guide as a part-time venture while you maintain your regular job."

Reel 'em in, baby!",How to Take Children Fishing,"


Forget the cute, cheap, fishing rods that are sold for kids. They are usually too difficult to cast, and the line is usually cheap. You will spend more time untangling knots than actually fishing. It will be tempting to buy the Donald Duck rod, but skip it.
Buy a good, ultra-light rod and reel. They come in five to six feet. Try to buy the shortest one you can, but not less than five feet.
Buy a spool of good line. There are a lot on the market. Stren is recommended for its ease of casting and fewer tangles. Go for a two - four pound test.
Buy a few torpedo style floats. There are some that are specially made for flies. Ask a clerk at your local tackle shop.
Buy some flies that are made for fly fishing. Make sure they are for dry fly fishing. This means they will float. They make some sponge spiders that do really well, and some called ""Pan Pops,"" too.;
, Attach the float so that it can slide along the line to the desired length. Tie on the fly, and you're ready to go.

, Try to find one that isn't very crowded. Kids can get enthusiastic with their casting, and we want to catch fish, not people. Also, look for a pond that has a lot of pan fish. We're not after a huge bass. Kids will be very happy with a bunch of bluegill.

,,, They don't have to cast far. In fact, they may have better luck casting closer to shore.

, Sometimes the fish will strike it as soon as it hits the water. If there is no action right away, start them reeling in slowly. Use a start and stop action.

, Usually there is no need to set the hook.

, If there are fish in the pond, they will hopefully catch more than enough to keep them happy. It will be fun for them.

Clip the tag line.",How to Tie a Palomar Knot," Hold the fishing hook vertical with your thumb and pointer finger. Poke the fishing line through the eye of the hook, and pull about 12 inches of line through.





;
, With the tag line pulled through the eye of the hook, poke the fishing line back through the hook eye. Leave room for about 6 inches of line on both sides of the hook eye; the tag end of the line and the looped end through the hook eye. This will ensure that you have enough line to make your overhand knot and pass the hook completely through the loop.









Try not to pinch the line and push it through the hook eye. If you’re working with very fine line, pinching it will create a kink that can cause a break in your line later when you’re fishing.Make sure that the tag line and reel line are not crossed over each other or twisted before you tie the overhand knot., With both doubled up lines, make a simple overhand knot. Cross the looped line over the tag line and line leading back to the fishing reel. Turn the looped line underneath the tag and reel lines, and loosely pull it. Make sure that the hook is hanging at the bottom of the loose knot.Leave enough space in the looped section of the line so the hook can later fit through the center of the loop.







, Hold the overhand knot with your thumb and pointer finger, and place the finishing hook though the looped end of the line.Gently pull all the lines back to make sure nothing is caught on the hook or around the sometimes rough area of the bottom of the hook eye.







, Use your mouth and tongue to lubricate the line and the knotted area near the hook eye.Hold onto the hook with one hand and let go of the looped line. Pull the main line and the tag line simultaneously with your other hand to secure the knot.









Lubricating the knot with saliva or water reduces friction in the line, which in turn reduces the chances of having the line break later on.The final knot should be secure on the top of the hook eye, not on or near the bottom of the hook eye or the hook shank., Separate the tag line and the line going back to the reel, and pull them in opposite directions to make sure the knot is tied tight. Use scissors to trim off the excess end of the hanging tag line.Leave a centimeter or two of leftover tag line.

Refreeze unused frozen shrimp.",How to Hook a Shrimp," Many fishermen like to hook their shrimp through the head. There are two ways to do this.


Insert the hook from under the shrimp’s head, and push the barb out on top, avoiding the vital organs. This method is preferred when fishing the bait off the bottom.






Insert the hook through the top of the shrimp’s head, working the point under the vital organs before pushing it out elsewhere on the top of the head. This method is preferred for bottom fishing.There is one drawback to hooking a shrimp through the head: it is more likely to fall off the hook.;
, Poke the hook through just under the shell tip, avoiding the stomach and pancreas. (These appear as dark spots on the shrimp’s body.) This takes advantage of the shrimp’s swimming action.


You can also hook the shrimp just below its head and thread the shrimp so that the hook comes out in the center of the carapace between its vital organs. This lets you cast further and retrieve the shrimp more easily, but it will die sooner than if hooked crosswise through the carapace.







, This method lets you cast still further, as the shrimp’s head, where most of its weight is, will propel the bait further without tearing the shrimp’s body off the hook. Break off the shrimp’s tail fan, then thread the hook through the tail center to hide it and poke it out through the underside of the tail, far enough for the shrimp body to cover the hook eye.


You may want to use a baitholder hook, one with barbs on its shank, to better hold the shrimp’s tail in place.






Breaking off the shrimp’s tail fan releases a fish-attracting scent.






You can also hook the shrimp crosswise through the tip of its tail. This method is preferred when dealing when heavy bottom snags other than weeds.







, This method of rigging a shrimp is similar to the self-weedless rigging that bass fishermen use when fishing plastic worms. Break off the tail fan, then run the point completely through the tip of the tail. Pull out the shank and rotate the hook so its point faces the shrimp’s underside, and then bury the point in the meaty part of the tail.This self-weedless arrangement can be fished on a Carolina rig. Thread a 1/4 ounce (7.09 g) sliding sinker onto your line, then tie on a swivel. On the other end, tie 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) of leader and your hook, then bait it with a shrimp. The weight will take your baited hook to the bottom, while the swivel will keep it from sliding all the way to the hook, and the leader will let your bait rise just off the bottom.You can also use this arrangement with a 3-way swivel. Attach your line to one end of the swivel, your bait and leader to a second end, and a 1/4 to 2 ounce (7.09 to 56.7 g) bell or dipsey sinker to the third end., While live shrimp entice fish to strike by how well they swim, dead shrimp draw fish by how they smell. For that reason, you can break off the head, feet, and tail fan before threading the rest of the body on the hook – and some anglers don’t even bother to take this step.

, Either method is valid; you just have to make sure the entire shank of the hook is covered.

, Dead shrimp are great for adding the test of real crustacean to a jig, whether it has a skirt or a soft plastic body. If you decide to tip your jig, cut the shrimp with a knife into hook-shank-length pieces. This will ensure the bait is the right length and, by cutting instead of breaking, keep the flesh firmer and on the hook longer.


For particularly meaty pieces of dead shrimp, you may want to add a trailer hook to ensure that the fish don’t take the bait and miss getting hooked.
Some anglers prefer to pinch off the tail fan and joint above it, then thread the shrimp tail-first onto the jig head, making sure the shrimp body lies flat when the hook is pushed through the body., You can keep live shrimp in either a single-layer bucket or a two-layer minnow bucket. A two-layer minnow bucket makes it easier to change the water as needed.


Some guides use 5 to 15-gallon (18.9 to 56.8 l) buckets.

, Too many shrimp in the water means some of them will start to die – and when some die, others will soon follow.

, Check the temperature regularly, and add ice as needed to maintain it. Change the water every so often to keep the shrimp in cool and clean water.

, Like any other marine creature, shrimp need a supply of oxygen to stay alive. There are two ways you can supply it:


Use an aerator.






Use an oxygen-releasing tablet. Both of these items are available for use with minnow buckets and will work just as well with shrimp., Dead shrimp can be preserved in brine and carried in small jars the way freshwater fishermen carry pork rind in their tackle boxes. You follow this procedure:


Get 1/2 to 1 pound (226.8 to 453.6 g) of fresh shrimp.






Remove the shells, heads, and tails.






Cut them into pieces twice the size at which you’d fish them live.
Place a layer of salt in the bottom of a small jar.






Place a piece of cut shrimp on top of the salt.






Place a layer of salt on top of the cut shrimp.
Place another piece of cut shrimp on top of the salted shrimp.
Repeat alternating between salt and shrimp layers until the jar is full. The salt will preserve and toughen the shrimp to make it stay on the hook longer.

, Unused frozen shrimp can be packaged and re-frozen for use on another fishing outing, as long as they haven’t spoiled. It’s best to check with your significant other about doing so and to carefully separate the packages of frozen shrimp from frozen foodstuffs and label them as frozen bait shrimp."

Try artificial bait.,

Try gigging.",How to Fish for Flounder," Flounder can be found up and down the Atlantic coast of the US in rivers, estuaries and streams near the ocean, where they migrate in the fall. Flounder fishing is especially popular in Southeastern states such as Florida, Alabama, and South Carolina, but flounder are also plentiful in the Northeastern coastal areas.


There are often restrictions on the size and/or number of fish you can catch, so check your local ordinances. You may need a fishing license to fish in your area as well.;
, Flounder can actually be fished all year round, but they're easier to catch in the fall, between September and November, when they migrate toward the ocean. They spawn during the spring and summer, and when they're large enough, the swim to the ocean to spend the winter there before coming back.


If you want to fish for flounder in the winter and spring, you certainly can; however, expect to catch smaller flounder that may not be large enough to keep.
Check local fishing reports in the area you plan to catch flounder before you plan your trip.

, Flounder tend to lie on their sides at the bottom of the river, estuary or coastal area where they reside. One particularly large species of flounder is called a ""doormat,"" referring to its shape and preference for residing low to the ground.


Flounder are grayish-brown with lighter spots, helping them blend in with sandy, pebbled riverbeds and estuaries.
Flounder have both eyes on the same side of their head, enabling them to see what's happening above them as they lie on their sides.

, Flounder like to stay near ledges and dropoffs, where they can ambush passing fish.Find areas where the current runs from shallow to deeper water, and you're likely to spot flounder there.


One good way to figure out where the ledges and drop-offs are is by wading the area before you cast your line. Feel around with your feet to discover the best hiding places for flounder.

, Since flounder stay close to the ground, they leave tracks in their wake when they move away to feed. Getting familiar with these telltale tracks while the tide is low should tell you where you can find flounder when they come back in with high tide. Getting to know the area where you want to fish is the best way to get lucky with flounder. Take several trips to the area at both low and high tide to get more familiar with the fish's habits.

, Flounder respond well to live fish such as minnow, mullet and croakers.Sea worms and clams are also effective. Hook larger baitfish through the lips, and smaller baitfish through the eye.


You can add some strips of fresh squid or live shrimp to vary the bait mix.
If one type of bait doesn't seem to be working, try another. Flounder can be picky, and they won't always bite, even if they liked a certain type of bait in the past.
Consider catching your own live bait in the area where you're fishing for flounder.

, If live bait is hard to come by in your area, or if you want to vary things up, use red, pink, white or yellow grub-tailed jigs. Sometimes flounder actually prefer artificial bait, so it's a good idea to have some on hand if you aren't having luck with live bait.

, A medium 7-foot casting rod is standard for catching flounder. Use line that's sturdy enough to handle larger fish that might take the bait - 14-pound or so. Use a circle hook, which is easier for flounder to bite. You'll also need a sinker to make sure the hook is within reach of flounder down below.

, Flounder typically stay in one place on the bottom, and you'll need the bait to cross their path to hook one. While it is possible to fish for flounder from a stationary location, you're a lot less likely to catch one this way.


Flounder fishing is easily done from a boat, since you can let it slowly drift and entice the fish with your moving bait. Try to find a current that will move you steadily along the surface of the water without carrying you along too quickly for fish to bite.
Make sure you can feel the surface of the bottom. If you can't, you may not be using enough weight. Attach a small weight (the size of a BB) about 12"" to 18"" above your rig to ensure that your bait stays along the bottom.

, Since flounder lie sideways on the ground, it takes a few extra seconds for them to get a grip on the bait. Before reeling the fish in, wait about 5 seconds to make sure its mouth is definitely hooked.

, You can also catch flounder by ""gigging,"" which is essentially spearing the fish with a barbed spike. You wade through shallow water at night while the fish are stationary and spear them. Aim low because the water will bend light down, making the fish appear a little further away than it actually is.

Assemble the items needed to make this gaff.,

With the jigsaw, cut the keyhole and the slot on the side.,

Use this device for landing fish that weigh more than the breaking strength of your fishing line.,

To use this device, reel the fish until it is below you and slip the device over the main line.,

After snagging the swivel, set your rod down and pull the fish up with the cord.,

Do not use a snap swivel because it might come apart from the stress.",How to Make and Use a Keyhole Gaff," These are listed below in the ""Things You'll Need"".

If you are 30 feet (9.1 m) from the water (rather than 15 feet), your cord must be longer and the plywood must be heavier in relation to the cord, to easily slide this device down the main fishing line and over the swivel.;
, The slot on the side is where you will place the gaff over your main fishing line. The thin slot, in the keyhole, is where you will snag the swivel, so this slot must be thinner than the swivel.

With the drill, make a hole that is big enough to pass the cord through.

, For example, if the fish weighs 10 pounds and your main fishing line is 8 pounds test, your main line is going to break.

For bigger lines, even if your main line's breaking strength is bigger than the fish's weight, it is easier to use a cord to pull the fish up. For example, if your mainline is 18 pounds test and the fish is 10 pounds, your hands are going to hurt grasping such a small diameter line.

, Let the device slide down until it is past the swivel. Snag the swivel, by lifting the device somewhat sharply so that the leader slides into the keyhole slot. The hook and leader must be strong., The short leader line, which is between the swivel and the hook, should be stronger than the main line., For ease of attaching or removing of the leader to the swivel, use a big loop and cow hitch it. Another option would be to keep using a snap swivel but to have a split ring between the snap and the leader."

Most sporting goods stores sell them. Your state's wildlife management department also publishes a booklet on regulations,limits and restrictions. It is important to know and follow these--not only because it's the law, but also because a lot of time and energy is put into keeping fish populations and ecosystems as productive and balanced as possible.






;
, If you shop around, you can find rod and reel combinations starting at about twenty dollars. You will also need hooks, line and weights. Although there are cheap pieces of equipment, the more you pay, the longer the equipment will last and the better it is likely to be.









The rod/reel will may come pre-spooled with line. Check that line to make sure it can withstand its rated strength, if not, you will have to buy 4 to 8 lb. test fishing line and spool the line onto the reel. Many sporting goods stores have top quality line in bulk, and can spool it for you at a very reasonable cost. You will also need #6 to #10 hooks, the ""split shot"" weights that are simply pinched onto the line, and a net. Reusable split shot is usually only a few cents more, and well worth it. You might wish to buy steel shot as some believe that lead weights can harm the fish and the environment.

, Light tackle is preferred for river trout. The fishing pole will have the weight range of the line printed on it. You need to buy a rod that is rated between 2 to 8lbs. Buying the rod/reel combo is usually the best and cheapest way to accomplish this. Some experienced anglers suggest that you stay away from the enclosed type fishing reel that has a button on it that you press to release line during the casting of the bait. This type of reel is prone to internal tangles, and will frustrate a new angler to the point of turning him or her away from the sport. On the other hand, closed faced reels are very easy to use. It depends also on the style of fishing that you will be doing. Closed faced reels are great for bait fishing, but are ill-suited for using spinners or other lures. On the other hand, open faced spinning reels work well for both styles.








, You need one that either naturally has trout or better yet, is stocked with trout. The Wildlife management booklet should have this information listed in it. Just pick one near you. Rivers with naturally reproducing trout populations sometimes have stricter tackle and bait restrictions, such as ""artificial lures with a single hook only."" These are much harder to use to catch trout.








, The easiest thing to do is to tie on a barrel swivel using a simple clinch knot. Under no circumstance should an overhand knot be used. This will cause the mono filament line to cut itself. Try tying one of these knots in the line and give it a quick jerk if you would like to see how harmful this knot is.








, This serves 2 purposes. First, it allows you to cast more effectively, and it allows you to control how fast your bait will drift, if at all. Place the weight about 2 feet (0.6 m) below the hook and be sure to pinch the weight hard enough that the weights will not move on the line, but loose enough that you can adjust their position on the line as well. A pair of needle nose pliers works well.








, Check regulations to see what bait is permissible. Three popular trout baits are live earthworms, salmon roe, and canned corn kernels.









Small spinners, spoons and other lures can be used as well. If you are fishing in a small river, use lighter lures. An exception to this is small, fast moving rivers. These waters require heavier lures.

, This allows your bait or lure to drift with the current and appear more lifelike. A good rule of thumb for trying to catch visible fish is to go 20–50 feet (6.1–15.2 m) downstream and cast upstream past the fish. This also serves two purposes. As stated earlier, you need to have a lifelike drift on your bait or lure. Also, most trout face upstream and wait for food to be washed towards them. That means that if you go downstream you are behind them and less likely to be seen. If you do spook the fish you should wait about 20 minutes before attempting to fish that spot. In smaller rivers it is also important to ""rest"" a hole after catching a fish. This entails waiting 15 - 20 minutes before fishing the hole again, or fishing a different spot for awhile before coming back.








, Fish will bite in almost any condition, but you should at least attempt to remain dry. You can match your bait to the weather conditions. During a rainstorm and up to 24 hours afterwards many earthworms will be washed into the river. This is the best time to fish worms. On windy days baits like grasshoppers or crickets are effective. This is due to the fact that windy conditions cause these bugs to end up in the water.








, When you get there, leave all of your fishing stuff in the car and go scout out the situation. Be mindful to look for other fishermen along the shoreline. Look for any nice clearings on the shoreline that are easily accessible. You'll also want to look for slow moving patches of deep water, or any area where the river goes from deep to shallow or shallow to deep. Converging currents are another good thing to look for. If it's a stocked river, there will be plenty of people fishing. In general, they are nice people, and if you stop and ask how the fish are biting or if they caught any, they will warm right up to you and are more than happy to explain to you where and how to catch fish in that particular river.








,, If you are using one of the worms, you need to push the hook through the end of the worm and work the length of the worm onto the hook until the worm gets to the end of the hook, then pull the tip of the hook out through the worm to expose it. Pinch off the remainder of the worm about 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from the hook so that a small part dangles from the end. If you are using the Roe or the corn, simply push a couple of pieces onto the hook just past the barb.








, This seems simple but can be difficult.









Again, the direction you need to cast on a river is up-river, then you allow the bait and line to drift downriver in the current. Cast to the 11 O'clock position as you are facing the river. If you are fishing a lure you cast to the same area, but pull the tip of your rod back slowly after the lure is in the water to get it moving before you reel in.
Bring the rod tip behind you slowly, and press and hold the button on the reel with your thumb. Quickly bring the rod tip around to directly in front of you and release the button in the middle of the cast. Be careful not to whip the rod to hard or your bait will get thrown off the hook.
If using a rod without a button, use your forefinger to hold the line, then flip the bail (the little bar) up and continue to hold the line. Follow same instructions as above, by holding on until the middle and letting it fly.

, Once the bait gets past you, the line will start to tighten up, so keep your eyes on the rod tip and where the line is going in your peripheral vision. Any small pulls on the rod tip could be the bait bouncing off rocks or it could be a trout tasting the bait. Wait for the trout to take the bait. You will know when you have a fish on by the big pull on the rod tip.








, Do this by quickly jerking the rod tip up 1–2 feet (0.3–0.6 m). If you've hooked the fish, your rod will be bent over constantly. Reel in slowly and keep the rod tip above your head. If you lower the rod tip, the fish can get off the hook as it violently thrashes about in the water. Once you have the fish reeled in to shore, take your net and gently scoop it up.








, Are you going to keep it or release it? Once again, you need to know the regulations on what size fish you are allowed to keep. Stocked fish are usually about 9 inches (22.9 cm) long if stocked small and are too small to fillet, but are delicious when prepared whole.There are fish stocked catch able size (12in.+) If you do not fillet the fish you will need to clean it (remove it's innards) before cooking it. Please keep only what you will eat. Stocked fish rarely survive over winter or reproduce, and compete with wild fish. It is better to keep a couple stocked fish for dinner and release all wild fish., If you do not wish to keep the fish, it is very important that you not handle the fish at all if possible. Trout, like all fish, have a protective coating of slime on them. Touching them removes the slime and will actually ""burn"" the fish where you touch it. Most trout survive a proper release. Wet your hands and net before handling the fish. Try to keep the fish in the water and grasp the hook at the curve, either with your fingers or forceps, and remove it from the fish gently. The idea is to pull the hook out the same way it went in. If the fish swallowed the hook, you will have to cut the line and try not to pull on it very much as you will rip the fish's insides apart and it most likely will not survive. Be VERY careful not to squeeze the fish, as this will cause internal bleeding and a very slow, painful death for the fish., Support the fish upright gently, heading it upstream, until it regains its balance and it will swim away. Do not throw or drop the fish from very high as it may burst the air bladders the fish has to maintain buoyancy underwater."

",How to Fish a Small Creek," You will need to address several considerations in making your choice. Here are a few:


Is the stream on public property, or do you have permission to fish there?
How clean is the water? Streams in agricultural or industrial areas may have pollution levels that make the fish unhealthy, or, in extreme cases, poisonous. Ideally, choose streams above the elevation of nearby industry.
Does the stream have good water flow year round? Some streams only maintain a flow during snow melt season, or when sufficient rainfall occurs to support them.
The species of fish you are intending to fish for. Keep in mind, small streams generally don't support large sized specimens of the fish that live in them, due to the limits imposed on this particular environment.;
, Generally, the basic items you have to have are a hook and line, and bait. For practical purposes, though, you may want to look at some refined fishing tackle for small stream fishing. These are some things to consider:


Use light or ultralight fishing tackle. Small streams are often crystal clear, and you will need a very light monofilament line to keep the fish from being spooked.
Bait or artificial lures appropriate for the fish you are fishing for.
Use long shank wire hooks in the smallest size suitable. You will get hung up on snags, and long shank wire hooks will bend, rather than breaking, so they will pull free of the snag. This will save time replacing lost hooks. Another benefit is the ease of getting a long shank hook out of a small fish's mouth.
Appropriate accessories may include insect repellent, a creel or bucket for the catch, and in some cases, waders to keep your feet dry.

, Creek fish are usually truly wild fish, or natives, and will often prefer native food for bait. Worms, grubs, insect larvae, and small insects like crickets and grasshoppers are good choices. Small jigs and spinner baits may be easier to use if the species of fish you are angling for will bite them.

, Digging worms requires a suitable location, like a compost heap or other place with good moisture and rich soil. Catching crickets or grasshoppers will test your reflexes, speed, and eye-hand coordination, but either method will add to the self-sufficient experience if that is what you are looking for.

, Unless you are fortunate enough to have a creek nearby, you will need to load the car or truck and drive to the creek. Finding a remote area like a state or national forest can offer an experience both of good fishing and pleasant scenery.

, Even small streams may experience significant fishing pressure, so heading away from civilization can increase your chances of having a good trip, both in the amount of your catch, and the enjoyment of a pristine forest or wood.

, Fish any pool or eddy that has enough water to support fish. Often, a good fish can lay in the current motionless and invisible until your bait or lure gets close enough for him to attack. Fishing stump holes, bank undercuts, eddy pools, and other places that provide enough water to support fish will give you a better chance of success.

, Small streams in heavy woods will often have brush-cover banks and lots of blown over or washed in trees over the stream bed itself. You may find the only approach to a potential fishing hole is to wade the stream and stand in the current while fishing your chosen spot. Underhanded casting, if using a spinning reel, or flipping, if using a cane pole, can get your bait underneath any but the lowest branches and obstructions.

, Fish will suspend at a depth where the water conditions are most favorable, and feed in the depth where the natural food is present. Sometimes, this is on or near the surface, sometimes, it is flat on the bottom, so don't exclude any zone from your bait offering.

, If you fish with a spinning or bait casting rig, you can approach a pool from the downstream end, cast to the upper end, and allow the bait to drift through the water. This will offer the fish the most natural presentation of the bait, since insects and worms that fall or are washed into the stream follow a similar path.

, When using different artificial lures, try different colors, types, and sizes to try to establish the fish's preference. For live bait, you may try worms, insects, or insect larvae, even insects you may find on the creek's bank. There may also be hellgrammites and crayfish in the steam which you can catch to fish with.

, This makes it much easier for a less experienced fisherman to tell if a fish is biting, and also keeps the bait at a desired depth. Use the smallest float that will keep the bait off the bottom. This makes the setup more sensitive, since the float requires less force to be pulled under when the fish bites. Using a smaller sinker and hook will enable to use the smallest float possible.

,, Don't leave anything but your footprints when you go, so the next visitor to the spot you have enjoyed will find it clean.

, This may be an incredibly painstaking process for very small creek fish, but scale, gut and remove the heads in preparation for cooking. Keep the waste parts so they can be buried or disposed of to prevent an odor problem later.

, Small fish can be difficult to eat because of the many tiny bones, but fresh caught fish from a clear spring-fed stream are great, fried up crisp and golden brown (so that the bones are crispy like crackers).

Well, if you're reading this with a bag of chips in your lap and a soda bottle at your side, you may want to think again. This is serious stuff. People dedicate years of their life to reach the Olympics. Are you willing to do the same?


That being said, different Olympic sports require different types of fitness, flexibility, and skill. Swimmers, football players, and sharpshooters have very different training regimens.;
, So, here's the thing: you probably want to choose a sport you've been doing for a while. This whole 10,000 hour, 10 years of practice thing isn't 100% true, but it's not far off. The typical Olympian plays the sport for anywhere from 8 to 19 years before reaching the Olympics.Most Olympians started young, playing sports in primary school.If you are over 30 and do not have competitive sports experience, consider archery, shooting, or curling.It's much easier to make it to the Olympics in less popular sports. Fewer than 1 in 30,000 U.S. competitive basketball or tennis players make it to the Olympics, compared to about 1 in 100 judo competitors. That said, you may not get a choice: it's almost impossible to get to the Olympics in a sport you haven't fallen in love with.

, Future Olympians dedicate thousands of hours to the sport. Here's a rough example of a typical training schedule:When first introduced to the sport as preteens: 250 hours of training per year, over 6 months.
After making the junior national team as teens: 600 hours per year over 9½ months.
After making the Olympics team in late teens or twenties: 1100 hours per year over 11 months.

, Most Olympians say that coaching is the most important factor for success, and recommend it even before you compete at a local level.A coach helps you train effectively and without injury, teaches you new tactics and strategies in your sport, and guides you through the world of competitions.

, Finances can be a serious limitation for elite athletes. The further you get in a sport, the more you'll spend on coaching, equipment, and travel. It's so common for the parents of Olympic hopefuls to go broke that the US government is looking into a program to help them.You may be able to get a college scholarship or athletic sponsorship at some point, but many Olympic sports do not have major opportunities in these areas.


If you can, get a job that supports your training, such as working at a gym or pool. Doing some coaching yourself is a great way to stay immersed in your sport.
Flexible hours are another huge benefit, as you'll need some serious time off once you're competing at a national or international level.

, You know how they say if you want to be an actor, you can't have a plan B? How if you want to be anything that takes work, you have to want it and nothing else? Being an Olympian is one of these things. You have to want it so bad you eat, sleep, and breathe it. You have to dream about it at night. This is not a Sunday afternoon hobby.


You can't get there without a team. Family, fellow athletes, coaches, and all the supportive people in your life will help you stay motivated and make your dream possible.

, During the training season, elite athletes often train six days a week, but that doesn't mean constant workouts. In weightlifting, for example, a training day might involve only two hours of lifting and eight hours of recovery and active rest.Your body needs recovery time to get stronger and healthier, and pushing too hard is a path to the hospital, not the Olympics.


Cross training is another valuable part of training. Depending on your sport, you'll dedicate varying amounts of time to flexibility, strength, and endurance training.
The exact training schedule depends on your sport, which is part of why a coach is so valuable.

, It's all well and good to have a coach, to be practicing every day and to be super serious about it, but then you gotta put your skills up to the test. In many sports, it's the only way to climb up the ladder and eventually get noticed (loads of Olympic sports don't have ""tryouts""). So start locally, go regional, and eventually hit Nationals!


The more you do something, the easier it becomes. Imagine having the Olympics be your first competition! Getting loads of competitions under your belt, even small ones, will prepare you mentally.

, You're not training a few hours a day — you're training 24/7. Everything you do will determine your progress, performance, and success. This takes diligence, perseverance, patience, mental stability, and discipline. Here's why:


Your diet. Everything you eat affects you. Load up on carbs at the wrong time and your workout could crash and burn. Too much caffeine and you're not sleeping. Too much or too little of anything that keeps you from performing at 110% is off limits.
Sleep. Most Olympic hopefuls get 8 to 10 hours of sleep every night, and often take a 30 to 90 minute nap during the day.Your body needs downtime to repair and recharge after intense exercise.
Your lifestyle habits. If you're downing a 40 of PBR between bong hits, this isn't for you. Let's just leave it at that.

, If you've been competing for a while, it's possible you'll get noticed. The cream of the crop usually gets at least some money for their time, either from sponsors or from your sport's governing board. Don't expect to make big money, but do keep an ear out for opportunities.


Because of that, look into being a part of your sport's NGB That's the National Governing Board for whatever it is you're doing. The more you make yourself known, the better.

, Concrete, achievable, short-term and long-term goals. You need things to work toward that aren't ""being awesome"" or ""training every day."" There are records that deserve breaking. There is competition that can be quantified. So set goals for this week. Set goals for this month. And set goals for this year. It'll align your efforts like none other.


The great thing about this is that you'll probably be dealing with a lot of numbers. Whether it's going faster, harder, or doing more, there's a number associated with it. So keep an eye on yourself and what you're capable of. If you know where you started, you know where you've gone — and where you can go.

, Millions of athletes are good enough to compete at some level. To know if you're made of Olympic-quality stuff you've got to look at yourself realistically. How do you compare? How long will it take you to start comparing? Is the time investment worth it? What has your progress been like? What's feasible? What's coach have to say about it?


It's important to do this on the regular. It takes the fun out of it, sure, but you're making a decision that affects years of your life. You have to know where you stand at any given point in time. You must develop the ability to take feedback, evaluate your progress, and understand what sacrifices need to be made if you wish to continue.

, The Olympics aren't always tomorrow. There will be times when you're just training to get better. Those are the days where it'll only take the majority of your day! Then there's the time when the Olympics are six months away and it's your entire life. Prepare yourself mentally for a full-time job away from your family and friends.


It's not gonna be easy. There will be days when it feels like it's not worth it, too. Those are the days when you gotta grab your mind by the corpus callosum and wrestle it into submission. You haven't done all this work for nothing. You can go back to drinking boxed wine and watching bad movies with your non-athlete friends later.

, You don't necessarily have to love it, but you have to know it, tolerate it, and even sometimes ask for it. As the author and runner Haruki Murakami wrote, it's because of pain that ""we can get the feeling of really being alive.""You won't be able to lift your arms above your head some days. But the feeling will pass, and the next time it happens, it won't feel so bad.


Injury is not a laughing matter here. We're talking wasting years of your life if you get hurt. And sometimes, sure, it takes a little pain to prevent a lot of pain. If you take one thing away from this, it's be safe. Never hurt yourself so hard you can't come back from it. Know what you're body can handle and what it can't. And be careful.

, For many, national championships in their sport is the key to the rest of their career. It's there that you may get scouted for the Olympics and secure the next couple years of your life. So once you've gotten all the smaller competitions out of the way, it's about time to go big or go home.


Not all sports work the same way, of course. Some sports have Olympic trials and some even have tried-and-true tryouts. But being on a national team, while not a guaranteed way to get into the Olympics, is a pretty darn good step.

, You can only represent a country that accepts you as a citizen — but once you're an elite athlete, it's not hard to make that happen. Some teams have extra requirements, but if you have an ancestor from a foreign country, look into competing under that nation's banner.There may be teams you haven't even heard of that don't require you to get a new citizenship. For example, U.S. citizens can compete in the name of Guam, the Marshall Islands, or American Samoa — and there's almost no competition for those spots., Again, though not all sports are the same, you may have to participate in the Olympic qualifying trials. And there you must be in the top of those participating — not just do well. Once you score in the top of your sport, you're officially in! WAHOO! Look at you go.


Okay, that's not necessarily true. Take boxing, for example: even if you dominate the trials, you may still have to participate in a national tournament (new regulations you can imagine competitors aren't super happy about).But even in these corner cases, doing well in the trials is a major boost.

, Between competitions, camps, and visiting different training centers, you may be traveling all the time. Not only does this cost a pretty penny, but it can be quite exhausting in its own right, too. It's hard on relationships and it sucks living out of a suitcase, but you'll get to see the world — although mostly through a plane window.

, Many countries have dedicated facilities for training Olympic athletes. These offer access to top-level trainers and equipment, and introduce you to the international community in your sport. some training centers even offer living space to athletes, which can be a big financial help.Olympic Training Centers in the US are located in Colorado Springs, Lake Placid, and Chula Vista.

, No joke. Many Olympians take it a little easier as the Olympics approach. ""A little easier"" here is, of course, way harder than any normal person would ever dream of, but still. You don't want to hurt yourself, burn out, or otherwise risk your chances. So relish it. The hard stuff is coming up. You deserve a little downtime right about now.

, Visualize every step of the process and how you want it to play out. Visualize every inch of your event, every placement of your body, every smile you want to make for the camera. Having it all played out in your head before you go on can be incredibly calming. Not freaking out is half the battle!


Every serious athlete has their own ""zoning"" ritual. Yours could be meditation, yoga, or even jamming out to your own personal theme song. Whatever gets your brain in the right place is what you should be doing. You'll know it when you feel it!

, It's a little cheesy, but it needs to be said. Even the most naturally talented people fail when their hearts aren't in it. A decent athlete who wants nothing in the entire world but to win can best an athlete who's wishing he were somewhere else. So get your heart into it. It can make all the difference.


Okay, if you're looking for something a little more scientific, we got it: a British study has come out that says it's not innate talent that's the end-all-be-all. ""Differences in early experiences, preferences, opportunities, habits, training and practice are the real determinants of excellence.""So if you don't believe cheese, argue with science. Even if you're not born the best, you can become the best.

Break in your new hiking boots.,
Before heading out for your hiking trip, do a once-over of your hiking boots to check that they're in top condition.,
Be prepared to clean your boots regularly during the hiking trip.,
Clean the boots upon your return from the hiking trip.,
Check the overall condition of the boots.,
Use a leather conditioner regularly to stop leather hiking boots from drying out.,
Store your hiking boots.",How to Care for Hiking Boots," When you first purchase a pair of hiking boots, wear them around the house and for short local walks initially, to help break them in. Hopefully you wore your usual hiking socks when purchasing on, so be sure to wear these when breaking them in too. Your hiking expedition will be a lot more enjoyable if the new boots already have some give and slight wear to them; otherwise, you may discover that you're focused solely on how much they're hurting you instead of enjoying the hike!


If you can't break in your boots on local walks, only attempt a leisurely hike at first.;
, A lot of problems with hiking boots can be warded off at the start, including breaking them in, waterproofing them, and checking that the boot is not in need of any repairs.


If they need waterproofing, do so before leaving home. It's much easier in the comfort of your home than trying to fiddle with this process out in the wilds. The type of waterproofing agent you should use will depend on the make and material of your hiking boot; it's recommended that you ask at your retailer for advice on the correct product or read the instructions from the manufacturer either online or in any literature accompanying the boots. Usually the waterproofing product will be oil-based for leather boots and silicone-based for fabric based boots. Follow the instructions on the product for waterproofing.
Check the shoelaces. Are they in good condition or is one or both of them close to breaking from wear? Are the aiglets (aglets) in good shape? If it's time to change the shoelaces, do so, as it won't be enjoyable to break a lace while you're out hiking.
Check for loose eyelets or D-rings, any cracks in the leather or other material, loose soles, loose inner soles, dirt, seeds, and other debris inside the shoes, and loose stitching anywhere. Attend to anything you see that might break, loosen, or cease to work when out hiking – better now than in the middle of a rainstorm in deep mud!

, The type of cleaning that you'll be able to do while out hiking won't be anywhere as thorough as the clean post-hike, but it does help to perform some basic cleaning tasks that help care for your hiking boots as you're on the go:


Remove the debris from your boots after the day's hike has ended and you're at camp or your cabin. Simply tip the boots upside down over an area away from the tent or cabin and bang them to loosen any dirt, seeds, and other debris that has accumulated in them during the day's hike.
Tap the pair of boots together firmly to remove loose dirt from the outside of the boots.
Using a stick, pocket knife, or other sharp instrument, dig the mud out of the soles of the boots, one at a time.
Allow wet boots time to dry overnight. If you can, stuff newspaper or a warm cloth inside them to help them keep their shape. Leave them at the door of your tent or cabin or hang them up outside if there is no likelihood of rain overnight. Don't dry leather boots in the direct sunlight, in front of a heater or before the campfire because the heat will crack them.
If hiking in a humid environment, take several changes of socks and rotate these during the day to remove the wet socks and add dry ones. Doing this should help to reduce the wetness of your boots. Overnight, be sure to hang the socks up to dry – do not stuff them into your boots!
If winter hiking, don't leave your boots out of the tent or they can freeze and crack. Place them inside a sleeping bag or use them as a headrest.
Repeat these daily cleaning tasks for the duration of your hiking trip. And before putting your boots on every morning, shake them upside down to remove biting or other visitors.

, This clean will be a thorough clean, the one you do prior to storage.


Remove all mud and dirt from the boots. As explained above, tip them upside down and shake them, then bang them together firmly to release all loose dirt and mud. Then use a stick or sharp tool to dig dirt out of the soles of the boots. Use a hard-bristled brush to remove remaining mud and dirt that has been caked on.
Wipe the inside of the boot to remove salt from perspiration. Use warm water to wash off salt and perspiration stains.
Wash the hiking boots in warm, mild soapy water to remove all traces of mud and dirt; you can use a rag to wipe over the boots. Or, use a proprietary cleaner recommended by the manufacturer – always be sure to read the manufacturer's warnings about what you can and cannot use to clean the boots with.
Allow to dry away from heat or direct sunlight sources.

Waterproof the boots. This job is best done after cleaning rather than waiting until your next hiking trip. As explained earlier, the waterproofing method you use will depend on the make and material of the boot. Oil-based waterproofers usually require two to three applications by hand, while silicone-based products can often be sprayed, rubbed, or wiped on using a tool that comes with the product. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions concerning application and drying times.

, Before putting the boots away, check the same basics that you checked before taking the boots hiking. In particular, replace fraying laces, loose eyelets or D-rings, and worn inner soles. At the very least, put replacement items down on your ""must-buys"" for the next visit to the hiking boot retailer so that you'll have the items before your next hike.

, Some waterproofers may have conditioners in them but don't assume that they all do. Pay particular attention to creases in the leather as these can crack when dry.

, Since hiking boots don't tend to be used all year around by most people, find a suitable storage place that is out of the way but still easily accessible when needed. Avoid humid storage or you may have problems with mildew growth. A shoe tree is the best means for storing them long-term.


Do not store hiking boots in plastic bags; this prevents them from breathing.

If you have not started serious training and are a teen or adult, keep in mind that for many sports, athletes must start training young to be able to compete while their body is in prime physical shape.If you’re not sure if you’re too old to be able to make it to the Olympics given your current skill level, consult with a specialist who can evaluate your chances.;
, Before you commit to a full training schedule, you will have to embrace the fact that you’ll have to make major life changes to be able to compete on an elite level. You may have to get homeschooled if you’re not already so that your training is your primary focus. While you are in training, your education and other commitments will have to take a backseat.


If you have already finished school, you still may have to make major sacrifices like relocating or quitting your job.
Keep in mind that to make it to the Olympic level, you will have to hand over a lot of money for coaches, training facilities, travel expenses for competitions, and many other additional and sometimes unforeseen costs.

, A coach is an essential element of your training. Even if you’re highly skilled in your sport, you probably don’t know the ins and outs of qualifying for competitions, the most effective training styles, and what it takes to compete on in international standard.You may be able to find coaches through the Internet or through a network of athletes in your sport. Make sure that the coach you choose has experience putting athletes through the Olympics.
A coach acts not only as a fitness trainer, but also as a guide and mentor through the grueling training process.

, Ask your coach to point you to a top caliber training facility where you can practice daily. Make sure the facility has all the equipment that you need to be able to practice all the expected skills in your particular sport., Research what you need to do to qualify for the Olympics in your individual sport. It's best to understand the qualifying requirements as early as you can so that you can structure your schedule and training around them.


You can also turn to your coach or your gym for information on how to qualify.

, Stretching and doing warm ups is an essential component of training. If you start to rigorously train without warming up, you run the risk of hurting yourself and not being able to compete at all.


Make sure that your warm up includes not only stretching but also light jogging or jump roping, as well as dynamic warm ups like lunges and squats.Ask your coach or a fitness trainer what the best warm ups are for your individual sport.

, Come up with a training schedule with your coach that has you in training six days a week. Spend at least a couple hours a day training, and change up your routine so that you’re constantly challenging your body.


Athletes training for the Olympics often take one day a week off to rest physically and mentally. If another schedule works for you, run it by your coach, but remember that you should rest at least one out of every ten days., According to your coach’s recommendations, also spend time every day you are training doing cardio like running in addition to strength training to supplement your other training.


What you focus on the most in your training depends on your sport. For instance, long-distance swimmers will focus mostly on distance and endurance, while a power lifter will focus mostly on strength training., Some Olympic sports, such as gymnastics, require athletes to be able to perform a wide range of skills so they can compete in different events within their sport. Make sure that you are practicing each skill required for your sport equally so that you can perform all skills consistently and confidently., Try to train with fellow athletes who are also preparing to try out for the Olympics. Training with others will keep you motivated and feeling like you are part of a community that is working toward a common goal. You can also learn from other athletes by watching their techniques and approaches.Fellow athletes are also a great source of support, since they understand the physical and mental challenges of training.

, Consult with your coach and enter national competitions that pit you against the nation’s best. Part of training for the Olympics is getting used to performing your athletic feats in front of large audiences and competing against other gifted athletes in high-pressure situations.Start with small competitions to get used to the pressure of competition. Then work your way up to bigger tournaments or qualifiers.
For many sports there is a clear trajectory of competitions that leads up to the Olympic qualifiers.

, Your diet is the fuel that you need to perform. If you don’t eat healthily or if you don’t eat enough, you run the risk of burning yourself out or overworking your body which can be harmful to your health. The recommended calorie intake varies for each sport, so check in with your coach or a dietician for advice.Because you are training rigorously, it’s essential to get a second opinion from an expert to help you make nutritional choices.
Even if you compete in a sport like long-distance running in which it helps to be lean, remember that your calorie intake should be much higher that the average person’s because of the amount you burn daily.
Always wait at least half an hour between eating and starting your daily training.

, Because athletes training for the Olympics sweat so much throughout their training, they have to drink many more glasses of water than the recommended eight glasses a day to ensure they won’t get dehydrated.


If you are exercising intensely for several hours a day, aim to drink half your body weight in fluid ounces of water., Aim to get eight to 10 hours of sleep each night and try to fall asleep and wake up around the same time. The consistency is good for your body and will make you feel more energized.To get to sleep faster and feel more rested, try not to look at screens or watch TV at least 30 minutes before you go to bed.

, A good support system is an often-overlooked aspect of being a successful athlete. You will need friends and family in addition to coaches and trainers in your life who support your dream. Being an Olympic hopeful requires a lot of mental energy, so it’s important to have people around who understand you and who you can unwind with.

, Training for the Olympics is not only physically challenging: it also requires an incredible amount of mental strength. Keeping your focus while still taking care of yourself and maintaining your relationships with others isn't easy. That's why many people training for the Olympics try out a number of techniques to stay healthy mentally.



Meditation is also a good way to relax your body and your mind, especially when practiced regularly. Learn how to meditate through a class or by reading resources online.Visualization, or imagining yourself achieving your goal, is a powerful technique that can help you before a major competition.
Remember to always listen to your body and to your own needs.

, Many people aiming for the Olympics find it helpful to see a sports psychologist. The pressure of competing on such a high level is something that not many people have to go through. This is why it can help to talk to a specialist who is used to talking to people in high-stakes situations., Training for the Olympics puts you more at risk of injury than the average athlete, both because of the stunts that you may perform and the sheer number of hours that you spend training. Meet with a physical trainer who can do an assessment of your fitness and your risk of injury.The physical trainer may assign you exercises that reduce your risk of injury for preventative care.
Many athletes also find that having weekly massages as well as visiting the sauna helps to relax muscles, which in turn reduces the chance of injury.

Siblings are naturally competitive, so you might want to mediate any running and jumping matches. Just remember to keep it fun and light-hearted to encourage young children to participate.;
, Discus throwing and shot put are popular Olympic sports. You and your child may want to watch the Olympians compete for the medal and then go out into the yard and have your own competition. You can throw frisbees like a discus or a ball like a shot put.Go to the park or in your backyard and set up your own mini Olympics course.

, The winter Olympics contains many popular winter sports, including snowboarding, ice skating, and skiing. You can take a trip to a ski resort and take skiing or snowboarding lessons with your child.


If you live in an area where it snows during the winter your child may be able to join a ski or snowboarding team.

, Your child may be fascinated by the archery competitions they see on the Olympics. Archery can be a great skill to learn. You can take your child to an archery range or buy a Nerf bow and arrow set to practice in the backyard.You may also consider buying a bow and arrows for your child. You can also buy targets filled with foam or straw for your child to shoot at.

, Open water sports are fascinating activities to watch during the Olympics. They may be even more fun to try as a family. Rent a kayak or canoe and visit a local river or lake to paddle around.Many state parks offer canoe and kayak rentals.
A kayak or canoe club might offer lessons on safety and offer guided outdoor adventures.

, Watching Olympic equestrian sports can be entertaining and exciting. While you may not be ready to buy your child a horse, you can let your child go for a ride on a horse. Many riding schools and horse farms offer individual lessons where you can take your child for a ride.If you have a friend or family member who own horses, ask if you can bring your child around so they can ride the horse.

, Tennis is a fun Olympic sport that can be played easily at most local parks. All you need is a tennis court, two rackets, and a ball. Take your child to a local tennis court and hit some balls. You might do more running than actual tennis playing, but you’ll get some good physical activity.If your child wants to learn how to play tennis, consider letting them take lessons or teaching them yourself if you know how to play.

, Track and field is a common summer Olympic sport. You and your child can go outside and start running. Go to a local track and time how long it takes to do a 50 meter, 100 meter, or 200 meter dash. Work towards a “marathon” by running longer distances.You can also set up a relay with your family, or set up obstacles to jump over like hurdles.

, Encourage your child to be like an Olympian and go for a ride along a designated bike path. Lay out a course around your yard, street, or neighborhood. You may also want to take your child to a local park or bike trails.You may get your whole family in on the activity by taking the whole family for the bike ride.

, Swimming is another popular summer Olympic sport that your child can partake in. If you have a pool in your backyard, swim laps like an Olympian. If you have a diving board, watch as your child safely dives into the water. If you don’t have a pool, many communities and gyms have public pools.If your child has never swum before, you may want to sign them up for lessons.

, Basketball is a fun sport to watch on the Olympics and a great sport for kids. Your child can go to a local park and shoot some hoops with you or their friends. Your child can also play HORSE or try to work on their skills as they dribble down the court.If your child has never played basketball, you can find a friend or family member to teach them.

Help your child develop their skills.,
Sign your child up for gymnastics.,
Take your child to a boxing gym.,
Take your kid to an ice skating rink.,
Enroll your child in martial arts.",How to Try Olympics Inspired Fitness for Kids2," As children get older, they may wish to participate in sports at a more competitive level. Organized activities such as track and field, or organized sports, teams, classes or lessons can all take your child's abilities to the next level. Qualified coaches can help your child develop skills and to achieve higher levels of accomplishment or competition., If your kid has watched the Olympics and become interested in gymnastics, you may want to let them take gymnastics. After your child watches the mat and bar routines, they may want to try those activities themselves. Consider letting your child start taking classes, or tumbling at home.A low-pressure way to get into gymnastics is to ""play"" gymnastics at home with some mats and 2 x 4 balance beam. Try somersaults, cartwheels, and headstands with blankets and pillows for padding.
You can call around your town to see if there are gymnastics studios that offer classes for children.
Your local gymnastics club may have open hours for kids to use the facilities, or gyms like the Y may offer gymnastics classes or equipment. You may also look for a trampoline park.
Decide if the price for gymnastic classes is worth it. Determine if your child will take the classes seriously, or if they will lose interest after a few weeks.

, Your child may have watched Olympic boxing and decided they want to try it. Some boxing gyms may have classes or training facilities for children. You may be able to let your child try a class or get a one-on-one session in which they learn the proper way to punch a heavy bag or do partner drills.Call your local boxing gyms to discuss whether they allow children. If they do not allow children to work out in their gym, you may be able to ask if they will give private lessons to your child.

, During the winter Olympics, your child can watch various sports that take place on the ice. This includes figure skating and ice hockey. Your child can take lessons to learn how to ice skate if they’ve never skated before.


Start out by trying to skate together with your child. Go to a nearby rink, rent skates, and get out on the ice with your child — learning a sport with your child is a great first step to encourage their participation.
After learning how to ice skate, they can start figure skating or playing ice hockey.
Both of these activities can be done with others. Figure skating can be done with a partner, and ice hockey is played as a team.

, The Olympics are a great time to watch martial arts with your child. Your child may watch fencing, judo, or tae kwan do. If these events get them excited, consider enrolling your child in a martial arts class.You can sign your child up for karate, judo, tae kwan do, or even mixed martial arts.

Watch the Olympics.,
Teach them the importance of fitness.,
Hold your own Olympics.,
Check out World Fit.",How to Try Olympics Inspired Fitness for Kids3," To educate your child on the Olympics and the wide array of physical activities available, you and your family can watch the Olympics together. Try watching the highlights each day for 15 to 30 minutes before venturing out to play at whatever you just watched. For instance, if you watched soccer, get a ball and go to the park or your backyard and practice running while controlling the ball, then passing the ball back and forth, and even setting up a target goal such as a tree trunk. Watch track and field before heading out to the park.


Don't spend too much time inside, watching TV. Avoid being an armchair athlete by limiting the amount of time you spend watching the Olympics.
It may be helpful to research what is available in your area first. For instance, if there's a pool nearby, then watch a swim or diving event before going to the pool. If you find that you have great bicycling trails in your area, watch some cycling events before hitting the trail with your child.
If you watched the Olympics two years prior, you can talk about the differences between winter and summer activities.

, Watching the Olympics opens up a good opportunity for you and your child to talk about health and fitness. Modeling good behaviors is an effective tool for educating children. At meal time you can talk about what athletes eat, to inspire your child's curiosity about performance and nutrition. Set a healthy example by being active yourself and providing meals and foods to fuel performance. Kids understand fun, and being active is fun. Games are fun. Learn by doing, not by talking about it. Experiential learning is often more valuable and engaging than discussion.


Use the sports and physical activity you watch on the Olympics to encourage your child to get fit. You may want to say, ""Why don't we go outside and run like those athletes?""; or, ""They looked like they were having so much fun. Let's go outside and see what kinds of sports we can have fun playing.""
Point out how not all Olympians have the same body type, but a body type that works for their sport. This could be a good time to emphasize body positivity and the importance of all body shapes. For instance, if you or your child are predisposed to a certain body type that is strong and stocky, try activities that are more strength-oriented, such as shot put, javelin or power lifting.
Talk about the gender equality in Olympic sports. Females compete just like males, and there are just as many female sports as male sports.

, To get your child in the spirit of the Olympics, you can hold your own Olympic games at home or at school. You can separate the kids into teams, or have each child choose a country to represent as they compete. You can make medals to give out to the winners.You can set up mock Olympic games, like track events such as the 50 meter dash. You can have a basketball or ice hockey game.
You can choose your own games that are easier to do in a classroom or backyard, like dancing or kickball.
An Olympics theme may be good for a birthday party or other children's get together.

, World Fit is also known as Olympians for Worldwide Fitness. It's a program for schools to fight child obesity by educating children and working to improve their attitudes about health and fitness. Olympians and Paralympians adopt schools and become mentors to teach the kids about teamwork, sportsmanship, fitness, and health.World Fit is designed for grades three to eight.
World Fit is a walking-based exercise program that lasts for six weeks.

These are recognized by the US Olympic Committee and the National Governing Body for taekwondo in the United States. This body educates coaches and checks their background for safety, so you can be sure that you are being trained safely and conscientiously.Use the Team USA taekwondo club locator app on the Team USA website to find a local school.;
, The World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) World Ranking has 8 senior weight divisions for male and female, respectively. The WTF Olympic Ranking is broken up into eight weight categories: 4 for the male and 4 for the female divisions. You can find out which category you fit by visiting the WTF website.Weight categories will differ for juniors. To check junior weight divisions, visit the Team USA taekwondo site., There are three main advanced attack methods. Each technique requires being in a strong physical condition and having flexibility, power, coordination, agility, and fast reflexes. In addition, one must exercise judgment as to which technique is optimal at any given point depending on the fighting conditions. The techniques are:Direct attack. There are three main types of direct attacks: the in-place attack, the incline attack, and the sliding attack. Which one you use will depend on the distance and stance of your opponent.
Indirect attack. There are three types of indirect attack: cutting, feinting, and footwork. These mislead the attack of your opponent.
Counterattack. There are direct and indirect counterattacks. The latter type of attack involves footwork followed by an attack, whereas the former involves staying in place.

, The more diligent you are about practicing, the better you will be at the sport. To get to the elite level, you will need to put in at least 20 hours of practice per week., Make sure you're fully equipped with the proper protective gear. Fighting without it could lead to injury. This gear includes a trunk protector, head protector, groin guard, forearm guards, shin guards, hand protector, gloves, and a mouthpiece., A coach can help you improve your skill and perform the best you can while also being an encouraging and motivating presence.The best way to find a coach is through a taekwondo class you are taking, especially because the coach will already have been checked for safety and expertise., Training does not just refer to practicing and sparring - it extends, for example, to obtaining an adequate amount of sleep. Olympians sleep an average of 8 hours every night, so aim to sleep this same amount. In addition, consider taking a 30 minute nap in the early afternoon to refuel your energy levels., Observe your current dietary habits and consider whether there are changes you could make to reach your goals. For example, if your goal is to lose weight but you eat huge portions for dinner, you might want to space out your meals throughout the day so that you can burn off more calories while sleeping.Consult a nutritionist to create a balanced diet plan that is tailored to your specific needs and health concerns.

, While sparring and practicing taekwondo techniques are important parts of training to become an Olympic fighter, you will also want to spend time in the weight room and working on core strength and flexibility. These are areas you must be well-rounded in in order to compete at an elite level.Consider signing up for a yoga class - you will get both physical and mental benefits that could complement your training., Aside from physical practice, Olympic athletes prepare psychologically for matches. Pick a mantra that motivates you before you step on the mat, read inspirational quotes or books, and, most importantly, develop a routine that you do not stray from. Successful Olympic athletes create and stick to a physical and mental preparation routine that will be reassuring when in a new setting for a match.Visualize your routine. Imagine all of the sensory input you will be getting, like the cheers of the crowd, the approach of your opponent, or the impact of your attack. This will motivate you as well as allow you to anticipate some of the surprise elements of the big day, which otherwise could work to your disadvantage., Family, friends, and teammates can boost your energy when training is not going as expected and can also be your #1 source of support when you win a tournament. Keep them informed of your progress by checking in with them regularly.

, Taekwondo is a full-physical sport that requires a tremendous amount of effort, dedication, and self-discipline. Remind yourself every time you step on the mat that your goal is to become an Olympic fighter and that this is a sport you are passionate about. You could even develop a motivating mantra that you repeat to yourself prior to any sparring matches.

, Becoming an Olympian will be an easier feat if you have increased your comfort level and sparring ability by practicing under different conditions and with different people. Try going to different low-stakes tournaments, mixers, or interschool workouts to get a feel for what it is like to fight a variety of people.


You could also ask your coach to help you visualize different combat situations or even create game-like situations to help you practice under different conditions., Look at where you are right now and establish a reasonable time frame for becoming an Olympic fighter in taekwondo. You will know if you are ready by listening to the opinion of your coach, gauging your performance at low-stakes matches, and speaking with fellow taekwondo fighters about their experience and readiness levels. If you need a few more years of training, allow yourself that time to improve and eventually compete with your best foot forward.


If you are ready to compete, it is time to sign up for tournaments.

, Alongside your coach, create unique offensive combinations that will allow you to score points while also keeping within the rules of the competition and thus avoiding penalties. The more unexpected your strategy, the greater the chance that you will take your opponent by surprise, which might just be the deciding factor for determining a winner., If you are sufficiently prepared, you can participate in tournaments as a means of getting scouted or simply as a way to practice under different conditions.


The American Taekwondo Association hosts tournaments throughout the U.S. which you can sign up for online.The WTF also maintains an updated list of national and international tournaments which you could inquire further about."

Put on any protective gear that you’ve brought.,
Keep your body moving.,
Seek shelter.,
Watch for changes in the terrain.,
Stay away from open fields, elevated areas, and water.,
Put down your trekking poles or other long objects.,
Pay attention to changing weather.",How to Backpack in the Rain1," All hikers should carry lightweight rain gear or at least a poncho in case of rain. If you don’t have these items, try to use what you do have, such as an extra garbage back that you carried just in case or a tarp.;
, Even if you’re trying to stay out of the rain, move around as you wait so that your body stays warmer. For example, march in place or step side to side. Hypothermia can easily set in if you get too cold, so generate as much body heat as you can., Look around you for a place to duck out of the rain, such as a tree canopy, a cave, a cabin, or even your tent. If you plan on camping and have a waterproof tent, you may find that settling in early and riding out the storm is the best solution.If you hear thunder, seek immediate shelter. Staying outside during a thunder storm is dangerous., Rain can cause flooding, mud slides, rock slides, and slippery trails, all of which can be very dangerous. Look for signs such as flowing water, rising tide lines, shifting soil, and a sheen on the surface of the trail. When in doubt, walk away from the questionable terrain., If you’re caught in a lightning storm, the most dangerous places to be include open areas, hills, mountains, trees, cliffs, and waterways. Lightning is most likely to strike these areas, so avoid them.

If you’re in the woods, try to find a small grove of trees that are surrounded by other taller trees. Tuck yourself in the lowest spot you can find.
If you are stuck in an open area, look for the lowest spot, crouch down, and keep most of your body from touching the ground. Ideally, just the soles of your feet will make contact with the ground.
If you have access to a vehicle, stay inside of it but try not to touch the sides of the car., In a lightning storm, trekking poles and long, pointy objects make a great conductor for the lightning and are therefore very dangerous. Protect yourself by laying these items on the ground away from you., Check the forecast before and during your trek, and watch for signs of a coming storm. If winds pick up and the sky becomes overcast, consider changing your route so that you can reach safety before the storm hits. It’s better to cut your trek short and have the storm pass over rather than get caught in dangerous weather.

Choose the right insulation for rainy weather.,
Dress in layers.,
Wear a hard shell raincoat and rain pants.,
Choose the right shoes.,
Wear a hat.,
Use a waterproof bag or use a pack cover.,
Protect your gear inside plastic bags.,
Pack a set of dry clothes.",How to Backpack in the Rain2," If you wear natural insulators like down or clothing made from cotton, the water seeps into the fabric and takes away the warmth. These fabrics can pull the heat from your body. Wool, fleece, and synthetics stay warm even in a downpour, so they are a better option if you know the weather will be rainy., Stay warm by wearing long sleeved wool, polyester, or microfiber clothing under your rain gear. If the weather will also be cooler, add multiple layers. Your clothes will likely still get wet under your rain gear, but fabrics like wool and fleece can remain warm. On the other hand, you may want to look for items that dry easily, such as polyester.Choose items that will feel comfortable and flexible under your heavy raincoat.Avoid cotton, which will hold the water and drain your heat., A hard shell raincoat will hold up better than a soft shell raincoat in a sustained storm. You can protect your legs with rain pants or vented pants, depending on the temperature of the area and your preference as a hiker.

Vented pants will be less insulating but dry quickly.
Rain pants can help keep in your warmth and repel water, but they will eventually succumb to the onslaught of water., For shorter backpacking trips, waterproof boots and gaiters are your best bet, while longer trips are best accomplished with breathable trail runners. If you’re in the rain for long periods of time, your feet are going to get wet no matter what shoe you wear. Trail runners are easier on your feet and dry quicker than other options., Your weakest link in staying warm is your head. Even with a hood, heat will escape from your head. Keep your head warm by wearing a hat. If you choose a hat that has a brim, you can also keep some of the rain off your face., While they’re expensive, waterproof bags far outrank pack covers in keeping your gear dry. A pack cover can easily be compromised by a wayward branch, which can pull off the cover. Additionally, water can still seep into the unprotected back of the bag. While a waterproof pack is preferable, a pack cover is better than nothing.Line the inside of your bag with a heavy-duty garbage bag., Protect items that need to stay dry, such as food, electronics, your map, your light source, etc. into plastic Ziplock bags, heavy-duty trash bags, or dry bags made for backpackers. If you are carrying a sleeping bag, tent, or other related items, make sure they are protected as well., If you’re camping, make sure that you have a set of dry clothes to sleep in so that you can change out of your wet gear overnight. Not only will you be more comfortable, but it will help you keep your body temperature regulated. Store your dry clothes in plastic with your other dry gear."

Choose a good trail.,
Avoid opening your pack.,
Make sure that your map stays dry.,
Snack often.,
Apply oils to your feet.,
Stay hydrated.,
Take short breaks.,
Avoid placing wet gear in your tent.,
Give your feet a chance to dry.,
Watch for the signs of hypothermia.",How to Backpack in the Rain3," If you know that the weather will be rainy, choose an area that you can enjoy in the rain, such as a trek through the forest. Consider visibility and safety, since waterways can flood and rocks can become slippery. When in doubt, plan to keep your hiking short and bed down early., Each time you open your pack water drips in. Even if it’s only a small amount of water, it can quickly compromise your pack. The water will remain in your waterproofed pack for the entire trek, so don’t risk lugging around the unnecessary weight.

Store frequently needed items and your snacks in pockets or in dry bags attached to the outside of your pack., If you don’t have a waterproof map, then make sure that your map never gets wet. Ideally, it should be secured in a plastic see-through bag. Try not to remove it when it’s exposed to rain., Regularly munching on snacks will help you keep your body warmer, which is important when you’re getting wet. Rain can cause hypothermia if you get too cool, so plan to eat more often than on a dry hike., The wetness from your socks can rub away your natural skin oils, which is what causes blisters. Applying a light salve to your feet can help prevent this from happening. Carry a salve and smooth it onto your feet when you settle in for the night., When it’s raining, some hikers forget to drink their water. Even if you don’t feel thirsty, make sure that you’re sipping on your water to keep yourself hydrated. Dehydration can quickly become an issue., Rainy weather makes breaks less desirable because it allows your body to cool down, causing you to be cold and uncomfortable. You also have the incentive to keep going until you reach your destination and can get out of the rain. However, not taking breaks can easily tire you out. Stay energized by taking shorter breaks than you normally would but more often.For example, if you would normally take a 15 minute break after hiking for an hour and a half, take a five minute break every 30 minutes.

, When you do stop to camp, keep your wet items separate from your dry items. Carrying wet gear into your tent can easily lead to everything being wet. Instead, cover up your gear and leave it outside the tent., When you stop to camp or to take an extended break, take off your shoes so that your feet have a chance to dry out. If you have dry socks, put them on. Otherwise, leave your feet bare. This will help keep your skin healthy and avoid blisters., Rain can lead to hypothermia, even if it’s not very cold out. Stay safe by monitoring yourself for signs of hypothermia. If you do notice any, take steps to warm yourself, such as pitching camp and changing your wet clothes for dry ones.Symptoms of mild hypothermia include shivering, slurred speech, tiredness, cool or pale skin, and shallow breathing.
Symptoms of moderate hypothermia include confusion, drowsiness, tiredness, shallow breathing, cold or pale skin, ceasing of shivering, and shedding clothes despite being cold.

Decide what kind of backpacker you are.,
Decide how many people you need to cook for.,
Consider your options accordingly.",How to Choose a Backpacking Stove," This can be determined by base pack weight (the weight of your backpack and gear before you put in any food and water). Here are some guidelines:


Ultra-Light Backpacker = 10 - 25 lbs base pack weight
Kind-of-Light Backpacker = 26 - 35 lbs base pack weight
Regular Backpacker = 36 - 45 lbs base pack weight
Everest-Climbing Backpacker = 46 + lbs base pack weight;
, Often backpackers will cook for themselves even when going out in a group. However occasionally you may want to get in on the communal cooking experience.

, Figure out how much weight you are willing to carry, how many people you want to cook for, and how long you are willing to wait for your food to be ready to eat. Whatever you decide to go with, always do some test runs with it before you take it with you backpacking, and do some test meals you have prepared with it. That will help you be prepared to use your stove properly because whatever type of stove you choose it will not be foolproof or condition proof unless you have learned how to use it right, and have appropriate meal plans.


Canister Stoves. These typically run on pressurized canisters of butane and burn hot and fast.

Boils 2 cups in around 2-3 minutes. Will burn at almost any altitude, in most any weather except very cold. You will have to keep the fuel canisters warm (above 40 deg F) continuously to vaporize/pressurize the fuel. And they are a plug & play set-up for the most part. Hook up the canister, light the stove and away you go. Plenty of power for group cooking. But you will pay the price in weight and literally with your wallet (not just for the stove, but for the fuel as well). Also, it is very hard to tell how much fuel has been used or is left in a canister, requiring extra canisters to be carried.
These expensive stove systems weigh a little under a 1lb not including the weight of the fuel canister which can be an additional 1lb of weight. 2 lbs of weight has you set solidly in the regular backpacker category perhaps nearing the climbing Everest category depending on how you assemble your pack.
Three problems with these stoves are that they are heavy, pricey, and produce a lot of garbage due to the disposable packaging.


White Gas (liquid fuel) Stoves. These stoves are pretty similar to the canister stoves except they typically burn white gas and are sometimes not as expensive as the canister stoves, but not always.

The benefits of white gas is that it's cheap, and has a lot of energy. But is also a little more finicky of a stove system. You may have parts you need to keep clean when you store your fuel bottle that hooks into the stove. You also have to pump up the fuel bottle to pressurize it before use, and if you have any spills in your pack because you forgot to screw the lid on tight you'll end up smelling like a gas station, and have stained gear where the fuel has leaked.
Boil times are competitive with the canister stoves at about 2:30 - 4:00 minutes per 2 cups. You will typically always have enough fire to take care of all your cooking needs. Plenty of power for group cooking. It is very useful for cooking at high elevation or melting snow as the cooking time on other stoves becomes excessive.
The weight price ends up being about the same as the canister stoves at about 1lb not including fuel. You are still a regular backpacker possibly climbing Everest but if you're lucky you could be considered a Kind-Of-Light Backpacker. The fuels (butane and white gas, as well as kerosene, alcohol and fuel oil) have the same amount of energy (heat) per pound of fuel.However, the container for butane must be heavier (steel)to withstand the pressure.


Alcohol Stoves. Seem to be by far the most favored choice among most ultra-light packers often being made of recycled soda cans. That being said, typically inexpensive and reliable. See also How to Make a Simple Beverage Can Stove.

Alcohol stoves need little fuel to cook most average backpacking meals allowing the user to carry less weight compared to other systems. Boils 2 cups in about 4:30 minutes. Plenty of power for group cooking, just make sure your stove is sturdy enough to handle the amount of weight you want to put on it.
Weighs 1.5 oz, and fuel + bottle weight can be as light as 4 oz for a 2-3 day trip. Aren't as robust in cold cold weather situations, or extremely high altitudes The fuel is safe to carry if it spills typically will not leave stains and completely evaporates so no smell is left behind. You have many different fuel choices you can burn in your stove that can be found at many different stores. Burn Liquid Heet® from your auto-parts store, Denatured Alcohol from the hardware store, or 91% Isopropyl Rubbing Alcohol from the pharmacy.


Esbit Stoves. These aren't really stoves as much as they are pot-stands with a cup to hold fuel. The fuel comes in solid tablets and are really lightweight.

Price is relatively cheap for amount of cooking time and fuel you'll need, but you also can buy just enough for one trip to make the price easier.
Cooking times can be slow in comparison to the above stove types. Somewhere in the range of 12 minutes for 2 cups of water. There is probably nothing lighter or simpler except for perhaps a campfire. But you pay for it in cooking time and not really being able to cook for a group.


Wood Stoves. These aren't really stoves as much as they are mini metal fire pits.

The weight can even beat esbit stoves, because you don't have to carry your fuel source (wood) with you. Of course there-in lies the problem if it is your sole means of cooking and aren't prepared to learn how to start a fire with wet wood in case you are caught in a downpour which happens all too frequently.
They are a practically cost-free choice if you have a tin can and the means to punch some holes in the bottom.
Boil times range widely, and are about what you could expect from cooking over a campfire. Some models are sufficient for group cooking while others are solely solo cooks only.

Hang the deer for skinning.,
Tie a strong rope or strap around the animal's antlers, or under the head as high up the neck as possible.,
Field dress your deer as soon as possible after you have shot it.,
Gut the deer by splitting the stomach membrane, working from the bottom, or pelvis, upward.,
When you have split upward to the base of the sternum, reach into the abdomen and pull out the organs.,
Look for the bladder near the spine in the lower area of the abdomen.,
Remove the anus and intestines.,
Split the sternum, or center of the ribcage with a large, heavy knife or a saw suitable for this task.,
Place any internal organs you plan to eat in a clean bucket or pan and rinse them with cool water.,
Dig a deep hole to dispose of the remnants of the cleaning process.,
Start by removing each of the hooves at the elbow.,
Begin cutting through the skin at the base of the animal's skull.,
Begin pulling the skin off the shoulders and neck, working your way downward toward the chest.,
Pull the skin off the carcass, either with a vehicle or by hand.,
Remove the head.,
Rinse the deer's carcass after the skin is removed.,
Wash the venison with plenty of cold water, then transport it with ice.,
Find a suitable location for aging.,
Hang the carcass.,
Age the meat for at least a week.Like beef, aging the meat causes the collagen in the muscle cells to break down.,
Prepare a clean work surface and assemble your tools.,
Split the backbone to separate the chuck meat (front quarters) from the round (hind quarters).,
Remove the backstraps and tenderloins.,
Saw through the ribs, cutting them all the way down the backbone, near the spine.,
Remove the shoulder and neck meat.,
Separate the hams from the hock joints.,
Prepare it for freezing.,
Make the cuts you'll want to eat.,
Freeze the meat.",How to Dress a Deer," Ideally, you may have a camp with a winch and a frame, or a tractor with a lift or bucket to lift the deer up. You will also want plenty of clean water available, preferably from a potable water system with a garden hose and sprayer.;
, Some hunters prefer to hang their deer by the achilles tendons with the head down, but generally, the steps are the same.


Hanging head up makes removing the stomach, intestines, and bladder a bit easier, and is less likely to contaminate the meat when this is done.

, Removing the internal organs and cooling the carcass is essential to keeping the meat from spoiling.

, Allow only the very tip of the knife into the abdomen, so that the stomach and intestines are not ruptured.

, Having a large container to drop them in will help keep your work area clean.


Note that the kidneys and liver will usually stay attached by their supporting membranes, but if you plan to save them to eat, be careful they do not spill out with the stomach.

, It will look like a translucent balloon filled with yellow liquid (urine). You will need to grasp it securely, holding the urethra closed, and cut it free without allowing it to drain.


Try wrapping the bladder in a ziplock bag while it is still attached. Zip up the bag as far as it will go. Then cinch down below where you plan to make your cut with a small rubber band or zip-tie. When you make your cut, the bladder will be safely enclosed in the ziplock, even if you rupture or pierce it, saving the meat.
Here, having a water hose handy in case of an accident is very helpful.

, With your knife, cut a circle approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) around the anus. Pull out the rectum very gently and tie it shut with a small rubber band or a zip-tie. This will keep any feces from contaminating the meat. Disconnect the connective tissue around the intestines and carefully remove from the body cavity.

, Spread the chest open, being careful the heart doesn't drop out if you intend to save it for food. Pull out the lungs and heart, as well as the wind pipe and esophagus, then rinse the body cavity thoroughly.

, The liver, as well as possibly the heart and kidneys are edible, but will need additional preparation.

, Your local Fish and Wildlife service may have a disposal area to save you this step. If you are in a remote area and the land owner does not mind, you can leave the organs for animals like coyotes to eat.

, With the point of your knife, find the joint and make an incision. Then, move your knife around the joint with the flat of the blade, cutting the ligaments and carefully working your knife around the elbow joint as deeply as possible. Twist the joint firmly and snap it off.

, Next, cut around it the base of the neck, then down towards the breastbone, and finally to the stomach, pelvis and the forelegs.


Take care to cut only the skin, and not the muscles or abdominal tissues, as hair will contaminate the meat in these areas.

,


If muscle tissue is pulling loose with the skin, scrape or slice through it so it doesn't tear loose as you go. Slicing the subcutaneous membranes will make the skin easier to pull free.

,


If skinning by hand, pull the skin down a bit, then slice the tissue that attaches it to the muscles underneath it, working a little at a time.
If you want to save energy and use a four wheeler or even a truck, you can tie a golf ball or a similarly sized stone under the skin, looping your rope around it, then tie the free end to the vehicle. Drive slowly away from the carcass, pulling the remaining skin from the deer with very little effort.

, Take the deer down and lay it out on a flat work surface. Just under the jaw, cut the ligaments to loosen the connective tissue around the neck. You'll need to twist the head sharply to break the neck and remove the head completely.


If you want to save the antlers, but not the head, you'll need to use a saw to remove a portion of skull about an inch from the base of the antlers.
If you want to save the entire head, keep it cool and skin (see below) it. Save any meat from the skull you wish to keep and boil the skull for several hours, removing the tissue and bleaching the skull. Clean it afterward with hydrogen peroxide to get it white.

, This will wash away any hair that has stuck to the meat and will also help cool the meat while you are completing the job. If you plan to have your deer commercially processed, it's ready to go to the processor after removing the organs. If you want to break it down yourself, let it cool thoroughly and take it indoors or to a clean cutting surface on which you can work.

, Do not wrap it with cling wrap or butcher paper at this point, which will trap heat in the meat and promote spoilage. Make sure the carcass is cool and dry. As soon as possible, the meat needs to be transported and stored at 34–38 °F (1–3 °C).


Avoid freezing the meat right away, as freezing will inhibit the aging process and speed its spoiling after the meat is thawed.

, The most difficult part of the process is finding a space big enough for your deer that can be temperature controlled. The most popular location is generally a garage, shed, or an outbuilding. Places that receive some heat seepage from the house, like a garage tend to be particularly effective.


If you don't have a garage, talk to friends and other hunting acquaintances to find a suitable location. Or follow the first few steps of the breaking down process to quarter the meat and age it in a spare refrigerator. The quarters from an average deer should fit in a standard fridge.Err on the side of too cold. Generally, you'll freeze at least some of the meat after breaking it down anyway. Be very careful not do let your venison spoil by aging it above 40 °F (4 °C). Make sure to keep a thermometer in your aging space.

, Use a meat hook and chain or rope to affix the meat to a sturdy rafter in your aging location.


If you don't have a meat hook, try using an old wire hanger inside the carcass to hang the deer.

, The quality and flavor of the venison is greatly improved by letting the meat sit for a week in a cool space with good air circulation.


This causes the surface of the meat to dry, but don't worry--this can be trimmed off during the butchering process.
The meat will continue to grow more tender for 16-21 days.

, It's helpful to have a large cleaver and a boning knife for this task. Make sure your tools are sharp and clean and that you've got a sterile work surface large enough to handle big pieces of meat.


Try setting up a portable card table or picnic table and cleaning it with food-safe sanitizer before you begin.

, Using a saw or a meat cleaver, find the point at which the rib cage meets the backbone (it should be between the 12th and 13th rib) and cut through the spine. Use firm pressure.


After you've made an incision, you may need to put one hand on the hind quarters and one hand on the for legs or neck area and bend them toward each other to break the back in half.

, Probably the most tender and tasty cut of venison, the tenderloins are the dark, lean, red meat found inside the cavity, running alongside the backbone. The backstraps or ribeye are also called the ""outside tenderloins,"" and are found opposite the tenderloin, along the backbone on the other side of the ribs.


To remove them, run your knife along the inside of the backbone (for the tenderloin) or the outside of the backbone (for the backstraps), and work the meat loose of the ribs and keeping the edge of your knife as close as possible to the bone, to get as much of the meat as possible. Use long even cuts as you pull the meat away from the bone.
You'll find these in both the hind quarters and rib section of the carcass.
This is the best cut for steaks or roasts.

, You can either separate the ribs, or leave them intact as whole side of ribs. The brisket can be found on the outside of the ribs, near where you've opened the belly for removing the organs.


Alternatively, you can leave the entire backbone area intact for cutting into chops with a meat saw later. To do this, leave the tenderloins and backstraps in place, and remove the upper shoulders by cutting the muscles that attach them to the chest, working from the bottom (the armpit) up, lifting on the leg as you do so. Since there are not joints in the bones connecting the front shoulders to the chest, a good, sharp knife is all you will need.

, Many people do not realize how much meat a deer's neck has in it. This meat isn't as good for steaks, but is ideal for grinding into sausage or cubing for stew meat. Work your knife around the shoulder joint, twisting the arm away from the body as you loosen it.

, The hams of the deer are the fatty meat found around the back hips or the rump of the deer, and the hocks are the remaining leg meat above the joint where you removed the hooves. Hams make decent steaks and hocks are good for stewing.


If you want to leave the bone in, cut the hindquarters from the deer by sawing through the pelvic bone on either side of the spine, then separate the ham from the hock by cutting through the joint.
If you want to remove the hams from the bone completely, work the hind legs off the hip by working your knife into the ball and socket joint, lifting the leg away from the carcass as you work. Next, position the ham at a perpendicular angle and about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) from the top, perpendicular to the leg bone, and cut straight down through the ham. Cut the meat from the leg bone by shifting your knife parallel to the bone. You can immediately cut this meat into steaks or leave it whole for stewing or roasts.

, With a very sharp boning knife, remove fat, cartilage, and any bruising, discoloration and dry spots that result from the aging process. Much of the toughness or undesirable gaminess negatively associated with venison can be lessened by removing these parts.

, The meat is at the perfect stage for butchering, which will also save time down the road when you're ready to defrost it and get cooking.


If you have a meat grinder, take this opportunity to grind the neck and flank muscles for sausage or ground venison. Cube the shoulder meat for stewing or leave it whole for slow roasting. Cut steaks 3/4 of an inch thick, across the grain.

, In labeled meal-sized portions, pack the meat into plastic freezer bags. Squeeze as much of the air as possible out of the bags and that the bags are sealed tightly before placing them in the freezer.


Don't forget to date the meat. Meat prepared this way should remain good for at least a year.

Before you decide to go catching beavers, make sure that you check what the restrictions are in your area. The following restrictions are for the United States.Zone A (northwest), beaver season is from November 1st to March 30th.
Zone B (northeast), beaver season is from November 1st to March 30th.
Zone C (south), beaver season is from November 1st to March 31st.
Zone D (Mississippi River), beaver season is from the end of duck hunting season to March 15th.
If you are a property owner who is having troubles with beavers on your property, you can usually get a permit to get rid of the pest. Go to your local wildlife regulation department (sometimes called Department of Wildlife and Game, or similar, depending on your area).;
, You want to look for the areas with the best beaver habitats, because that is where you're more likely to find beavers. This means looking for areas that are conducive to building their beaver lodges and dams and that have the right food sources.Beavers need a year-round water source. Places where you're likely to find beavers are by streams, lakes, ponds, wetlands, and low-lying water areas like lowlands or swamps. In urban areas they are becoming more common in road-side ditches, drainage ditches, and sewage ponds.
Beavers are herbivores, and their diet changes seasonally, so if you're tracking a beaver in the appropriate time (November to March) you're going to be looking mostly at their winter and spring diets.
In winter, beavers prefer to eat sweet gum, ash, poplar, pines, as well as birch, willow, and aspen. Look for areas that have these types of trees in large quantities, as well as a year-round water source.
In spring, beavers will be more likely to eat aquatic plants and the green shoots of plants, so look for areas that have a water source for the aquatic plants.

, There will be obvious signs that a beaver is in the area when you start to look for them. They tend to cut down trees by chewing through the trunks at a 45 degree angle. This tends to give them an hour-glass shape that is pretty obvious.Along with toppled trees you'll see a lot of wood chips, and stumps in beaver areas.
You will also see the drams, or lodges that beavers create, on the waterside. These are usually big piles of interwoven branches on the water, with an underwater entrance. They can be up to ten feet in height and up to 5 feet (1.5 m) in width. Not all beavers live in lodges, however. Some live in burrows along the river or pond-side. if this is the case, you'll need to look for other beaver markings.

, Beavers will leave certain markings in the areas they inhabit. These will be things like tracks, or scat, which can let you know that you're in the right area.


Beaver's have unique tracks that can be difficult to discern, because their wide, flat tails and the branches that they tend to drag with them can obscure the tracks. Instead of looking for the tracks themselves, look for places where something has been dragged (like a thick branch).
The most likely place you'll locate actual beaver tracks is in the mud at the edge of the water source (river, pond, etc.). Beaver tracks look like small, human-like hands (typically 2.5 to 3 inches long). They are 5-toed.
You can also look for their scat, which resembles wood chips. However, beavers typically deposit their scat under water, so it's harder to find than the more obvious evidence (fallen trees, and drag trails, for example).

, There are a couple different places that work to set your beaver trap. You could find the entrance of the dam or lodge and set it there, if the water is shallow enough. Otherwise, you'll need to find a beaver path.


Find a beaver path. Beavers, like most animals, are creatures of habit. They tend to stick to the same paths, through the water or over ground. If there's a dam that separates two ponds, set the trap on top of the dam, because the beavers will go over the dam.
Find shallow water near the dam or lodge. Look for a narrow trough in the shallow water. These troughs tend to be empty of debris at the bottom, so they are clear for the beaver. Set up the trap in the trough. If the water is more than 10 inches, put a log across the top so that the beaver is forced to dive.
If you locate the entrance to the beaver lodge in shallow water (12 inches or less), that's the best place to set the trap. It will be less conspicuous and will be more effective, because the beaver will have to enter or exit the lodge at that point.

, This is the best trap to use for catching beavers, especially if you're new to trapping. It's illegal to catch a beaver and relocate it alive, so your options are trying to get it to leave its area on its on, or killing it. Body-gripping traps are the best way to do that.Conibear is considered the best body-gripping trap. It's the easiest to use and the safest to use.

, If you get a new trap, it will typically be coated in a lubricant that makes it dangerous to handle. To make sure that it's easy to handle, and less conspicuous when you set it, you need to soak it beforehand.


Soak in hot soapy water, then rinse the trap. When it's been rinsed, soak the trap in a mixture of hot water and ice cream salt. Set it outside to dry a couple days before you set the trap. It will be rusted and easier to deal with, so that it will be more effective in trapping the beaver.

, Again, the Conibear body-gripping trap is the most effective, easiest to use, and safest trap for catching beavers. However, this means that you need to set it properly otherwise you could end up getting injured. Check the instructions that come with the trap, because not all traps are set exactly the same and the one in the substeps is a Conibear trap.The trap consists of 2 springs (the curled wires on each side), 2 safety catches (the hooks hanging off the springs), 2 jaws (the square or rectangular body of the trap), 1 trigger (hangs down from the trap lock), and 1 trap lock (at the top of the jaws). Make sure you identify the different parts of the trap so you know how to set the trap.

, Extend spring so that it's pointed away from the trap. From there, grip and compress the spring. The spring creates the force that catches the animal in the trap when it triggers the trap.

, Pull trap frames together with one hand, while keeping the spring compressed with the other. Put a gripper over the jaws to hold them in place, or tie them with a rope.

, Set trigger in the preferred notch of the trap lock. Making sure that trigger is in the notch, grip compressed spring and release the frames slowly. If you're using a gripper or rope, release that, too., No matter where you're setting the trap, on a water-path, in front of the den, etc., you'll need to place it upright, with the trap lock at the top. You can attach the springs to sticks to hold it upright, or tie it in place.


You may have to build a small structure out of some branches to keep the trap upright and to block the beaver from going around the trap. Consider the area you're placing your trap and how you're going to need to set it.

, Check your trap regularly (every couple of days). You don't want the dead beaver to attract other animals, since once you've killed the creature, you should use it's pelt and meat so it doesn't go to waste.

, Wrap up from the base at least 3 feet (0.9 m). This will keep the beavers from being able to eat or use the trees. You will need to check your trees to make sure that the beavers are leaving them alone.


You can also make wire fences to prevent beavers from entering a specific area (especially around a pond). You can also put mesh coverings over culverts and the like to keep beavers away from them.

, Sometimes completely destroying the beaver's dam or lodge, as well as eliminating access to its habitat can discourage the beaver. You have to make sure that you carry away all of the dam, so that the beaver can't access it in order to rebuild.Use a sturdy potato rake and work from the downstream side, to completely destroy the dam or lodge.
You will want to keep checking the dam or lodge area to make sure that the beaver is not rebuilding and that there is no material available for rebuilding.

, There is only one repellant that has been proven to be effective in eliminating beavers and beaver damage. This is Thiram. You'll need to apply the repellant directly to the leaves and shrubs that the beaver has been using as a food source.Again it's good to use this method in conjunction with the other methods, such as destroying the dams and lodges and then spraying the food sources with Thiram.
There are other repellants and sprays you can use to discourage beavers from coming into the area if they haven't already, but only Thiram gets rid of them if they're already there., There are a couple different ways to control the water level so that it doesn't become conducive to beaver habitation. You can create a drain so that the water level stays down or you can keep the water clear of debris or anything that might prevent water flow.


Get a drain pipe by fitting two plastic sewer pipes together and perforate one of them. Depending on the volume of the water in the stream the diameter of the pipes can be 10, 15, 20 or 25 cm (4, 6, 8 or 10 in.).
Dig a hole in the beaver dam along the original stream channel. Set three-quarters of the pipe at almost any level in the dam, and extend the perforated edge into the beaver pond (upstream). Attach a weight to one end of the pipe.
Allow around one quarter of the pipe to extend out on the downstream side of the dam.
Add about a 1 inch elbow or turndown to the perforated side of the pipe so that you discourage plugging of the upstream end of the pipe.

Start by getting the squirrel wet.,
Make incision under the tail.,
Make incisions on the hindquarters.,
Pull the pelt off.,
Remove skin from the hind legs.,
Remove skin from the front legs.,
Continue skinning.,
Remove the squirrel's head, hands, and feet.,
You have successfully skinned a squirrel.",How to Clean a Squirrel1," To keep hair from getting on the squirrel meat, wet down the fur. Do this by either placing the squirrel in a bucket of water, or dousing the squirrel with a hose.;
, Lay the squirrel belly-down on a flat surface. Using a sharp knife or razor blade to cut a horizontal slit 1.5 inches (~4 cm) beneath the base of the squirrel's tail. This slit will be below the anus running horizontally across the butt. The incision should be shallow, only deep enough to penetrate the skin, not the underlying flesh.


Leave the tail intact, you will use it later to help remove the pelt.

, Holding the squirrel, carefully extend the original incision along the back of the hind legs (rump). The incisions should be shallow, only deep enough to penetrate the skin, not the underlying flesh. You will now have a long incision running up the back of both legs and across the butt, under the tail and anus.

, Rest the squirrel on a flat surface that is clear of dirt and leaves. Grab hold of the hind legs, step on the tail and pull the squirrel out of its skin by its hind legs. Think of removing the skin as you would a sweater. The pelt should come off the torso in one piece. Stop when you get to the front legs.

, Holding the squirrel by the tail, separate the pelt from the flesh of the the hind legs. To do this work your fingers under the pelt and separate the muscle from the skin. This can take a little time, just be persistent. Do not try to speed up the process by using a tool. A tool is more likely to damage the skin, just use your fingers.

, Separate the pelt from the flesh of the the front legs. To do this work your fingers under the pelt and separate the muscle from the skin. This can take a little time, just be persistent. Do not try to speed up the process by using a tool. A tool is more likely to damage the skin, just use your fingers.

, Continue to pull the pelt until its around the squirrel's neck.

, Use a sharp and sturdy knife to slice through the muscle and ligaments of the hands, feet and head of the squirrel. Then with your hands twist and crack off the appendages. You may find pliers helpful for removing the hands, feet or head. Do not try to cut through the bone. This will dull your knife and splinter bone into the meat.

, Next gut it.

Make the incision .,
Remove the innards from lower abdominal cavity .,
Remove the innards from upper abdominal cavity.,
Rinse.",How to Clean a Squirrel2," Turn the squirrel over with its belly facing you. Pinch the stomach and make an initial small incision. Use a sharp knife or razor blade to do this and keep the cut shallow. Insert your blade into this initial incision, cutting edge up, and run your knife blade from the pelvis to the bottom of the rib cage. You want to cut through the muscle and underlying membrane but not into the guts themselves, especially into the intestines or bladder, which can taint your meat. If done right there will be very little blood.

, Spread the back legs, like a butterfly, to open up the belly area. Reach in and pull out the intestines, liver, stomach, kidneys, and visceral fat from the lower abdominal cavity.


Inspect the liver before you eat the meat. If the liver looks pale, off-color, or spotted, do not eat the meat. If the liver is deep, dark red and looks healthy, the meat is fine to eat.

, Next, return to the main carcass. Use your knife or cooking shears to cut the ribs along the breastbone. Spread the ribs and reach into the chest cavity; and remove the heart, lungs and diaphragm from the carcass.

, You now have an intact skinned squirrel carcass ready for cooking. Rinse it with some clean water. Then immediately cook it, or refrigerate or freeze it for longer term storage.

Monitor your vitamin and mineral intake.",How to Eat Like an Olympian," On easy, low-intensity training days, you'll want to build a well-balanced plate at each meal. You should include foods and beverages from each major food group.About half of your plate should consist of vegetables (both raw and cooked), vegetable-based soups, and fresh fruit.
Approximately one-quarter of your plate should consist of lean protein sources. This may include poultry, beef, fish, eggs, low-fat dairy, soy, nuts, and legumes.
The remaining one-quarter of your plate should include whole grains like pasta, rice, potatoes, cereals, bread, or legumes.
You should get about one teaspoon of fats that come from avocado, nuts, seeds, cheese, butter, or oils.
A good meal plan might include granola or oatmeal for breakfast, turkey lettuce wraps for lunch, and blackened chicken or fish with quinoa for dinner.;
, On moderate-intensity days, you'll want to increase your lean protein and whole grain sources. However, you should still balance each meal with a proportional serving of fresh fruits and vegetables.Approximately one-third of your plate should consist of vegetables. These may be raw, cooked, or in soup.
About one-third of your plate should consist of grains. These include pasta, rice, potatoes, bread, cereal, and legumes.
The remaining one-third of your plate should consist of lean protein sources. You may include poultry, beef, fish, eggs, low-fat dairy, soy, nuts, or legumes.
Add at least one to two servings of fruit. Your fruit can be fresh, stewed, or dried. You should also aim to get about one tablespoon of fats that come from avocado, nuts, seeds, cheese, butter, or oils.
A good meal plan might include a frittata for breakfast, a salmon pasta dish for lunch, and a casserole for dinner., On high-intensity training or competition days, you'll want to increase your consumption of carbohydrates. You can do this by eating more whole grains, but make sure you still round out each meal with adequate portions of lean protein and fresh fruits and vegetables.About half of your plate should consist of grains, including pasta, rice, potatoes, cereals, and bread.
Approximately one-fourth of your plate should consist of vegetables. These may be cooked or raw, or served in soups.
Approximately one-fourth of your plate should contain lean proteins like poultry, beef, fish, eggs, low-fat dairy, nuts, legumes, or soy.
Get at least one to two servings of fruit (fresh, stewed, or dried). You should also get two tablespoons of fats in the form of avocado, nuts, oils, seeds, cheese, or butter.
A good meal plan might include quinoa power pancakes for breakfast, sweet potato quesadillas for lunch, and spaghetti and meatballs for dinner., When you have snacks between meals, it's important to weigh your caloric intake against your training for that day. Talk to your trainer or a nutritionist to determine which snacks would suit you best on a given training or performance day. Some common snacks that Olympic athletes may go for include:


fruit and yogurtgranola and almond butter balls
roasted chickpeas
low-fat peanut butter cups
chocolate bark, cookies, or brownies

, Carbohydrates help fuel your performance. Without adequate carbohydrate intake, your body will grow fatigued more quickly and you won't be able to sustain continuous or high-intensity workouts.For moderate- to high-intensity athletes getting one to three hours of exercise each day, it's recommended that you consume 6 to 10 grams of carbohydrates per kilogram of body weight each day.
For very high-intensity athletes exercising four or more hours each day, it's recommended that you ingest 8 to 12 grams of carbs per kilogram of body weight daily.
Remember that pounds are roughly double the weight in kilograms. For example, a moderate-intensity athlete who weighs 150 pounds (68 kilograms) should consume 408 to 680 grams of carbohydrates each day.

, There are many different types of carbohydrates. Which ones you choose will depend on what period of your training you are entering. Some should be consumed every day, while others are best reserved for periods of intense physical activity.Nutrient-dense carbs should be part of your everyday diet. This group of carbs includes bread, cereal, grains, fruit, starchy vegetables, legumes, and low-fat dairy foods.
Nutrient-poor carbohydrates are high-carb foods with few other nutrients. This group of carbs, which includes soft drinks, sports drinks, energy drinks, and carbohydrate gels, should be reserved for intense training periods.
High-fat carbohydrates, such as baked goods, potato chips, french fries, and chocolate, are best reserved for occasional carb boosts. These foods should not be used while engaging in training sessions.

, Calculating when you eat your carbs is just as important as figuring out which carbs to eat. You'll want to time your carbohydrate consumption so that you can maximize your performance during your training or competition.General fuel-up carbs should be eaten about 90 minutes before you exercise. Be sure to give yourself enough time to properly digest your food.
Carb loading should take place about 90 minutes before sustained or intermittent exercise.
Pre-event fueling should take place at least one hour before a competitive event.

, Protein helps your body build and repair muscle cells and connective tissue. You also need protein to help transport nutrients throughout your body. Not getting enough protein can lead to your muscles breaking down over time, resulting in lower strength and energy.Elite endurance athletes should be consuming 1.3 to 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight each day.
Resistance athletes should be consuming between 1.0 and 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight each day.
Remember that pounds are approximately double the weight in kilograms. For example, a 150-pound (68-kilogram) endurance athlete should be eating about 92 to 108 grams of protein each day.

, Some foods contain more protein than others. How much protein-rich food you eat will depend on your dietary needs and the foods you choose to eat.To get 10 grams of protein from animal foods, you would need to eat either two eggs, 1.5 slices of cheese, one cup (250 milliliters) of milk, 40 grams of lean chicken, 50 grams of fish, or 200 grams of yogurt.
To get 10 grams of protein from plant sources, you would need to eat either four slices of wholemeal bread, three cups of whole grain cereal, two cups of pasta, three cups of rice, 120 grams of tofu, 100 grams of soy ""meat,"" or 3/4 cup lentils.

, In addition to getting enough protein, you should ensure that you're consuming protein at the optimal times. You need protein throughout the day, but you should also boost your protein intake after training or competing.Ingesting large amounts of protein immediately after exercising helps your body take up and retain more amino acids. This, in turn, will help your body recover from exercise and repair muscle as needed.
Make sure you continue to eat enough protein throughout the rest of the day.
The increased uptake and retention of amino acids from protein consumed right after exercise will continue for up to 24 hours. This means that your protein source for breakfast will be used as rapidly as the protein you ate after a workout last night.

, Whether you're participating in an Olympic sport or trying to improve your diet and exercise regimen, you'll want to consult with your doctor first. A doctor will be able to advise you on whether your diet or exercise plan will meet your nutritional needs, as well as whether your body can handle the physical stress of such a regimen.

, Staying hydrated is crucial for your day-to-day survival, and it's particularly important when you exercise. To properly monitor your hydration levels, you should weigh yourself before and after every workout so you know how much water you lost through sweat.It's imperative that you stay hydrated before, during, and after training to prevent dehydration.


Prior to your training session, drink at least 16 ounces of fluids two to three hours before exercising, then another 8 ounces of fluids about 15 minutes before your workout. You should also weigh yourself before exercising.
During your training session, drink just enough water to prevent dehydration. Sip on water periodically whenever you feel thirsty.
If you are able to closely monitor your body weight before and after training, you'll know approximately how much of your body weight is lost through sweat. Aim to keep that figure below two percent of your total body weight loss.
Weigh yourself after training and drink 16 to 24 ounces of fluids for every pound of body weight you lost through sweat.
If you're out of shape or working in intense environmental conditions like heat and high altitude, you'll need to drink more water than someone who has a more developed level of fitness.

, If you do not drink enough fluids before, during, and after exercising, your body will become susceptible to dehydration.Some common symptoms of dehydration include:


darker urine color
muscle cramps
headache
nausea and/or vomiting
elevated heart rate
difficulty concentrating
fatigue early in your training sessions and/or difficulty recovering after training

, Alcohol generally impairs your body's ability to perform by over 11 percent the day after drinking. There are no benefits to drinking alcohol during training periods. For this reason, it's generally recommended that athletes avoid drinking alcohol within 48 hours of training or competition., Some caffeine can improve your performance by increasing your endurance while improving your concentration and reaction time. However, too much caffeine can leave you feeling jittery, sick, and unfocused. For this reason, it's best to use caffeine strategically and in limited doses.Everyone's tolerance varies, but it's generally recommended that you limit yourself to one to three milligrams of caffeine per kilogram of body weight. If you weigh 150 pounds (68 kilograms), that works out to 68 to 204 milligrams of caffeine.
There are approximately 95 milligrams of caffeine in one 8-ounce cup of coffee. By comparison, there are approximately 26 milligrams of caffeine in one 9-ounce cup of green tea and 47 milligrams of caffeine in the same size serving of black tea.
Drink caffeine approximately one hour before training or competing. If you will be training for over two hours, you may consume low doses of caffeine (80 to 120 milligrams) during your workout.
Avoid caffeinated energy drinks. These have very high concentrations of caffeine and may contain derivatives of banned substances like geranium or ma huang, which could disqualify you from the competition.

, Vitamins and minerals are an important component of your diet. When you're training and competing, you'll need iron to help produce red blood cells and oxygenate your muscles.You'll also want to get enough vitamin D, which helps foster healthy bones, well-functioning muscles, and strong cell regrowth.Athletes under 50 years of age need approximately 600 International Units (IU) of vitamin D each day and between 8 and 18 milligrams of iron. Vegetarians and vegans need almost twice as much iron (1.8 times the daily recommended intake).
Good sources of vitamin D include fish, mushrooms, and fortified milk, soy milk, or juice. You can also get most of the vitamin D you need by spending at least 30 minutes in the sun each day.
You can get rapidly-absorbed heme iron from animal products, while non-heme iron (which is not very well-absorbed) can be found in fruits, vegetables, legumes, and enriched grains.
Some foods and beverages inhibit your body's ability to absorb iron, and should therefore be limited in your diet. These include coffee, tea, cocoa, and foods rich in calcium.
You can increase your body's absorption of non-heme iron by pairing fruits and vegetables with foods rich in vitamin C. This includes citrus fruits and juices, strawberries, kiwis, tomatoes, broccoli, and peppers.

Use root vegetables and leafy greens to catch a rabbit.,
Try using fruit.,
Leave water for the rabbit.",How to Catch Rabbits1," The first step is to make sure you have the right bait on hand. Rabbits are herbivores. That means you will have to catch them with plants.


You could simply figure out which plants the rabbit is taking from your garden, and use those as bait. If you leave carrots for the rabbit, which is a good idea, grate them because it will set off a stronger smell.Brussel sprouts, corn on the cob, alfalfa, clover, and lettuce are all good baits to use to catch rabbits. Create a trail of the bait leading the rabbit directly up to the trap or to your hand. Rabbits also like cabbage.;
, Although rabbits mostly like grasses, leafy greens, and root vegetables, they also enjoy some types of fruit.


You could use dried or fresh red apples to try to catch a rabbit. Either version should work.Rabbits also like bananas. If you have another rabbit, bringing rabbit droppings will attract a new rabbit.
Spray apple cider with a spray bottle throughout the inside of the rabbit trap.The rabbit will be drawn by the apple scent, but the spray will also cover up human scent.

, Stray rabbits are often dehydrated, and water may attract them as much as food.


Leave a bowl of water for the rabbit. You will have the best chance of spotting a rabbit in the early morning or at dusk.This is when rabbits look for food or drink.
In the day time, a rabbit is usually hiding and will be harder to catch.Rabbits often hide out in bushes and trees or under decks. Some think rabbits will also eat cheesy biscuits and bread or be drawn by red fox urine."

Choose between a single-reed or a double-reed call.Typically calls are made with either one reed or two reeds and a wooden, acrylic, or polycarbonate sound chamber that amplifies the sound.,

Clean and tune your duck call after using it.Wooden duck calls especially will need drying out and wiping down after use, so the wood finish won't wear and crack.",How to Call Ducks,"


A single-reed call has a larger range, both in terms of volume and sound control, but is a little more difficult to master in terms of technique. This would be a good option for the advanced (or at least experienced) caller.
Double reed calls are quieter but easier to control and easier to vary in terms of sound. A double reed will require more breath, but is generally a better option for the beginner. Making accurate sounds is more important than volume and double-reeds have a reliable ""sweet spot"" that sounds very realistic.;
, While the notable differences are few between the different materials that make up the sound chamber, knowing the subtleties will provide you with a good guide if you're planning on buying and a smart use when you plan to use them.


Acrylic calls will make a loud, sharp noise. These are useful for open-water and long distances. They're also very easy to take care of, extremely durable, and will stay clean in the elements, but are the most expensive option by far.
Wooden calls make a soft and mellow tone that some say is more accurate. They're inexpensive, but more difficult to take care of, though they will last for a long time if you do.
Polycarbonate calls are generally the same price as wooden calls and offer a sound somewhere in between the sharpness of the acrylic call and the softer tone of the wood. They're water-resistant and reliable.

, If you're going to be hunting on open water, or it's particularly windy out, you're going to need a call with a lot of volume. If you're going to hunt from a blind, or with decoys the ducks come right up to, it would be better to have a softer call that offered more finesse in terms of sounds. When you know where you're going to hunt, you can pick a smart call for the job.


Talk to local hunters and sporting goods dealers to check out available calls and learn about popular varieties.

, Detailed instruction guides are available to guide you through the process of carving a wooden duck call, fitting it with reeds, and tuning it to the proper specifications. This allows you the option of customizing your call and designing it creatively.


Cheap do-it-yourself kits are also available, but these are often low quality.

, Most often, you'll hold the call by the sound chamber, wrapping your fingers around the hole to mute it as you would a harmonica. Conversely, you can hold the call like a cigar between two fingers and mute the end with the palm of your other hand.

, To find your diaphragm, cough into your hand. The muscle you use when you cough is the best way of forcing air into the duck call and making the most accurate sound.


You don't even have to have your mouth open to force the air this way, so practice with your mouth closed. Think of it less like you're blowing a bubble and more like you're trying to get something out of your lungs.

, Duck calls are short, repetitive, sharp bursts of sound, not long drones. Practice cutting the air off with your throat, making an oof sound.


When you're pushing air with your diaphragm, open your lips slightly and put the call up to them. It's a good way to trick yourself into doing it perfectly.

, If you can make a full ""quaCK"" sound, cutting off the air in an accurate sounding approximation of a duck's quack, you've got the right technique down.

, It's also a great way to score points with old-timers.


To do a hand-call, curl your thumb into your palm and close your fist around it. Next, dip your clenched fist in water to trap some water in the crevice your palm makes. This helps to put an accurate sounding ""rattle"" in your call. Blow between your thumb and palm, changing the shape by flexing your thumb slightly. This will take lots of practice to get right, but then you'll always be able to call ducks with or without a call.

, A quack is the most basic kind of duck call. The best-sounding quacks have a definite end sound to them. A beginner will usually make quacks that sound more like qua-qua-qua. Make sure you're cutting the air off with your diaphragm to get the right quaCK sound.


The lonely hen call is a variation of the quack and is very effective in attracting male ducks who are otherwise wary of duck calls. It is a long, drawn out sound, more like quainCK.

, This will consist of about five notes in descending tone with an even, choppy rhythm. The tone should sound something like kanc-kanc-kanc-kanc-kanc.


Pleading calls attract ducks that are flying overhead. The goal is to sound like a lone duck on the water pleading for other ducks to join it. The first sound is the longest, an attention getter, and the next sounds recall the greeting call: ""kaaanc-kanc-kanc-kanc-kanc.""
The ""comeback call"" sounds a lot like the greeting call and should be used if the greeting call fails. It's the same basic tone, but more staccato, making a single sound: kanC.


, Feeding calls are not an often-used call, but are useful in rounding out a series of calls. It's basic tone should sound like: tikki-tukka-tikka


When using this call, you should vary the volume slightly, starting loud and getting quiet, before building it back up again.

, Your hailing call should be loud and not too complicated, though live ducks often have more complex hailing calls. Some professional callers think this is an overused call.It sounds like aaaaink-aaaaink-aaaaink and should progressively get quieter.

, If you're hunting on a small body of water where it's not too windy, choose a duck call that isn't too loud, or you'll scare the ducks. A double-reeded wooden call is perfect for the job. On large bodies of water or when it's windy, you need a loud duck call. An acrylic call would be more appropriate.


If you only have one call, vary your calls to compensate. Remember: accuracy is the most important thing.

, Watch the ducks for reactions to your calls. Calls are to be employed when you've spotted a group of ducks flying overhead and you want to attract them to land as close as possible to your position. Calls are most effective when they're used sparingly, and they must be done correctly if you hope to fool the ducks.


Watch the ducks for their reaction to your calls.If you see them flying over-head and change their direction to your position, don't keep skronking away at full-tilt and risk ruining your cover. Wait for them and see what they do.
If you're calling more than once in 30 seconds, you're probably calling too much.

, If you're listening to Waylon on the portable radio super-loud, your whistles will make poor accompaniment.

, If you're hunting with decoys and the ducks are clearly attracted to them, don't risk ruining a good opportunity by blowing your lungs out.

, Ducks will often swoop around, dive, leave, come back and land several times before they decide to jump in front of your sights. Be consistent, avoid frustration, and wait.

, Listen to commercial CDs of duck calls. Listen and practice at home or in the car. Also spend time listening to real ducks in the wild. While you're calling, you should be actively listening to the sounds the real ducks are making so you can imitate them in response.

,


Unscrew the reeds and check to make sure they haven't broken or chipped, which will affect the sound of your calls. If they have, replace them.
Before you remove the reeds, use a felt-tip pen to mark how far down the reeds are screwed into the call so you can replace them at the same depth. Misaligning the reeds will result in a changed tone and make it difficult to reproduce your calls.

Make a wooden box trap.,
Buy an open mesh live animal trap.,
Place the trap where rabbits hide.,
Bait the trap.",How to Catch Rabbits2," These traps are basically wooden boxes with a door in the front for the rabbit to enter. Live traps can be used to humanely capture and then release rabbits.You will need a trigger in the middle of the trap to close the door once the rabbit nudges it. The trigger is usually a wooden peg with a wire or string that you attach to the front door. Wooden traps, even when made with plywood, can be somewhat heavy to move, though.
Place the bait to the back of the box as a lure to coax the rabbit into the trap. The rabbit should bump the trigger as it tries to reach the bait. Wooden traps are easy to build if you test the trigger a few times. They also are not very expensive.

, These traps are made of heavy wire mesh or gauge wire, and they might have a steel frame. You can find them at some pet or hardware stores or online.


Such traps usually have a single entry, where they are open at one end, or even a double entry, where both ends open, and they collapse for easier storage or moving. They work the same way as wooden traps. The rabbit is enticed into the trap with bait, and a trigger causes the door to close.
These traps are lighter in weight and more open. The animal doesn’t realize it’s being confined as much as it would with a wooden trap, so mesh traps can be more effective. Rabbit traps are usually 24""x7""x7"" and 24""x8""x8"". You don’t want to make it too big or you could catch other animals.

, Remember that rabbits usually live in areas with good cover. This means you will find them in brush piles, in fence rows, and in briar patches.


Rabbits also like low-cut bluegrass. You should place the rabbit trap along trails that rabbits have already made in these areas. Rabbits are likely to use the same trails as they have in the past.
Put the trap right in the pathway. You could also put the trap in front of a hole in the ground or in front of a brush pile, if you know that these are being used as rabbit dens. You could also place a trap in an area where you see rabbit droppings.

, In a trap with a single door, put the bait at the end. In a trap with two doors, put the bait in the center of the trap.


You want to position the bait, so you lure most of the rabbit’s body into the trap. This should set off the door trigger by engaging the metal plate in the trap.
Wear gloves when you bait your trap so that you don’t leave a trace of human scent in the trap. This will stop rabbits from coming into it. Put a brick on top of the trap so the animal won’t knock it over.

"
"
Use a snare.,
Catch a rabbit without a trap.,
Corral the rabbit once it gets close.",How to Catch Rabbits3," Some people use wire noose snares to catch rabbits because they are not very costly. One problem with a snare is that you will have to handle the rabbit to release it after catching it.


Rabbits can bite, so make sure you wear tough, impenetrable gloves before handling a wild rabbit.Before releasing a rabbit, you should check with laws and regulations in your area. Sometimes this won’t be allowed. In that case, contact a local humane society after catching the rabbit. Remember that rabbits can carry fleas and ticks, so handle them as little as possible.

, This is hard but possible. You will need to corner the rabbit so that it can’t run into the woods or other areas that are hard for you to reach. It helps if you get the rabbit used to you over days time.


Don’t look directly at a rabbit. The rabbit may perceive this as a predatory gaze. Believe it or not, but talking to the rabbit may calm it down.Rabbits are likely to come forward a bit to explore, especially if you have treats in your hands, like carrots, banana, or alfalfa hay. Be patient.

, You could catch the rabbit with a bat net with very fine mesh. Set the net down, and let the rabbit come close to you before scooping the rabbit up in the net.


Or you could scoop the rabbit into a pet carrier when it approaches you. Choose a carrier for a small or medium-sized pet.
Another method involves setting up a three-foot exercise or puppy pen in a semi-circle formation. You will probably need another person to do this. Once you spot the rabbit, set up the semi-circle, and then pen the rabbit inside. Then, coax the rabbit into the pet carrier.

Decide on what trap to buy.,
Locate your trapping spot.,
Place your bait.,
Set your trap.,
Catch a chipmunk.",How to Catch a Chipmunk1," Small rodent traps can be bought online, or at your local hardware store. They come in two basic types, 1-door and 2-door. 1-Door traps are simpler, and afford for better bait placement, but 2-door traps have a higher catch rate due to the fact that the animal can see through both sides and enter through either.;
, Locate your trapping spot. Look for signs of chipmunk around your property. See if you can find a chipmunk hole. If you have a patio you should look on the border of it. If you have a deck, you should check under it. If you can't find any signs of chipmunks, this method works just as well on squirrels.

, You'll need to use a bait that the chipmunks can't steal without going in the trap. Peanut butter works well, as does any sort of nut that is larger than the holes in the mesh of the trap. Place the bait on the trigger inside the trap, either at the opposite end of the door on a 1-door trap, or in the middle of a 2-door trap.

, The trap you bought will have come with its own instructions on how to properly set it. It usually involves the careful balancing of rods and locks. After you've set your trap, you'll want to test it by lightly pressing on the trigger plate. If it doesn't go off, consult the instructions and try again.


After your trap is set, avoid walking close to the trap or disturbing it in any way, as many traps can be quite sensitive.

, Check your trap often and regularly. Once you've caught a chipmunk. Handle the trap with care. Wear gloves to avoid being bitten through the mesh. Check your local laws before releasing your chipmunk outside of your property.After releasing the chipmunk, disinfect the trap before using it again. Use a disinfectant spray and a cloth to clean the trap.

Choose a rifle before going to the store.,
Ask to hold the rifle before purchasing it.,
Test fire the rifle if possible.,
Undergo a background check.,
Consider purchasing optics for your hunting rifle.,
Return to pick up your hunting rifle.,
Submit documentation on private sales when required.",How to Buy a Hunting Rifle1," Pricing on hunting rifles can vary greatly depending on the region you shop in and the store you choose to purchase the rifle from. Arm yourself with as much information about the rifle you want as you can before walking into a store to make a purchase. It can be easy to overpay for a rifle if you aren’t aware of its fair market price.Some firearms stores operate similarly to car dealerships in that the prices are set a bit high, but you may be able to talk them down. This is particularly true for used firearms.
Being knowledgeable about the purchase beforehand will help ensure you get a good price.;
, You may have your heart set on a specific rifle on paper, but when you seat it in your shoulder you realize that it feels all wrong. Being able to hold and maneuver your rifle comfortably is imperative to hunting. Not only do you need to be able to establish a comfortable natural point of aim, but the weight must be something you can easily carry and manage while aiming. If the weapon is not comfortable or too heavy, you may need to reassess your choices.Always check to make sure the weapon is not loaded before pointing it in any direction.
Seat the rifle in your shoulder and raise it so you can see where you cheek falls on the stock and if you are able to support the weight of the rifle comfortably. Make sure you do so in a direction where no one is standing.

, Some firearm dealers have on site shooting ranges that you can use to test fire weapons. While you likely will not be able to fire the specific rifle you intend to purchase (if it’s new) you may be able to fire the same make and model rifle to get a feel for the weight, ease of use, and recoil.You can also ask for a demonstration on how to properly load and unload the rifle.
Pay close attention to the recoil of the rifle. If it hurts to fire, you may want to choose a lower caliber weapon.

, When you’ve chosen the right rifle for you, you will need to complete a Form 4473. Depending on the location you purchase your hunting rifle, you may need to complete it on paper or using a computer. The Form 4473 contains sixteen questions relating to your background, history of drug use and criminal history. You will also need to provide proof of identification, contact information and your Social Security number. The result may come back approved, delayed or denied. The information you provide will be run through the federal database by NCIS to assess if you are legally permitted to purchase a firearm.
In some states, you can take a hunting rifle home the day of purchase with an approved background check.
If your background check is delayed, you will not be able to pick up your weapon until it has come back approved.

, If the hunting rifle you choose does not come with a scope, you may want to consider purchasing one. While some hunters prefer to hunt using “iron sights,” or the metal front sight tip and rear sight aperture on the barrel, most prefer using optics that provide some degree of magnification. Choose a rifle scope based on the distances you intend to hunt from and the type of rifle you purchased.Rifle scopes rated at 3x9 are the most common choices for beginner and experienced hunters alike.
The numbers in a rifle scope magnification rating represent the range it can magnify. 3X9 scopes can be set to three times or up to nine times magnification.

, Depending on where you live and the background check process, you may need to wait anywhere from one to ten days before picking up your rifle. Upon the purchase of the rifle, the firearm store will notify you of how long you will need to wait before returning. After the prescribed period of time, you may come back with the receipt and take ownership of the weapon.Hawaii requires a wait of fourteen days, but all other states in the U.S. require ten days or fewer.
In some states, having a license to carry a concealed weapon precludes you from the waiting period.

, If you purchased your firearm from another person rather than a business, you should ensure you are adhering to the laws in the area you live in. Eight states in the United States require background checks and other documentation to be submitted for private sales of firearms.While the responsibility is on the seller to ensure they adhere to state and federal laws when selling you a firearm, you should be aware of the legal requirements as well.

Gather your materials.,
Locate your trapping spot.,
Set up the trigger.,
Place the ramp.,
Place the bait and then wait.",How to Catch a Chipmunk2," For a bucket trap, you'll need a large plastic bucket, something that will work as a ramp, a flat piece of wood that will work as a trigger, and a thin stick to hold the trigger. You'll also need some bait, such as bird seed. For the ramp, find something long, flat, and sturdy, like a piece of wood. Something around one to two feet long will work. For the trigger, you'll need a piece of wood no longer than the diameter of the bucket.

, Locate your trapping spot. Look for signs of chipmunk around your property. See if you can find a chipmunk hole. If you have a patio you should look on the border of it. If you have a deck, you should check under it. If you can't find any signs of chipmunks, this method works just as well on squirrels. You'll want to place your bucket in the area around the chipmunk hole, or the area where you've seen chipmunks.

, Place the stick across the top of the bucket. Then place the trigger on the bucket, with one end resting on the edge of the bucket, and the other end hanging over the stick in the middle. Then, adjust the stick and trigger so that the slightest amount of pressure on the end of the trigger will cause it to tip over.


It's okay if it's not perfectly balanced. Just use your best judgment to determine whether the weight of a chipmunk on the unsecured end of the trigger will cause the trigger to tip over.

, Take the longer piece of wood or other material you're using as a ramp and lay it so that one end rests on the bucket, near the top. It should sit on one of the outer lips of the bucket, as close to the trigger as possible without disturbing the trigger.

, Put some of your bait at the entrance of the ramp, and even more bait on the unstable end of the trigger. You may need to adjust the trigger and the stick more if the bait causes the trigger to tip over. Then all you have to do is wait for chipmunk to fall for your trap. Check it regularly throughout the day.Optionally, you can place a trail of bait up the ramp as well. Use peanut butter to make the bait stick to the ramp without sliding down.

Secure the trap.",How to Catch a Chipmunk3," Look for signs of chipmunk around your property. See if you can find a chipmunk hole. If you have a patio you should look on the border of it. If you have a deck, you should check under it. If you can't find any signs of chipmunks, this method works just as well on squirrels. Find a spot free from grass and under a tree.


The tree needs to have a branch that's at least somewhat horizontal and close enough to hang something from it.

, Find a box at least 12in x 12in. Cut all closing flaps off with scissors. Cut two holes in the center of the top of the box about 2in apart. Then get a long piece of weed wacker wire or twine, at least long enough to go over a low branch in the tree and still have plenty to spare. Thread it through the holes and tie a knot to about 1 1/2in above the box.

, Move the excess string around so that when you hold it from about a foot up the string the box is decently flat. Throw the box over a tree branch that hovers over the spot free from grass. Give out 16 feet (4.9 m) more of string (still attached to the original piece) starting from where it's touching the tree branch.

, Go to the spot where the very tip of the string is. Tie the string to a medium sized, thick stick. You need to tie enough of the string so that the box hovers at least a foot above the ground. Drive the stick into the ground.

, Release the stick from the ground thus letting the box fall. Mark where the box fell. You can do this by tracing a light indention in the dirt with a stick.

, Pull the box back up and drive the stick back in to secure it. Inside the border of where the box fell, dig a hole 7in deep. Make sure it's to the shape of the box. Place the box over the hole to make sure it's the same size. Then pull the box back up and dig an extra inch each way so the box falls in when you lower it. Keep testing your trap and enlarging the hole until the box falls straight in every time you release the stick.

, Fill the bottom with about 3in of some kind of seed like pumpkin seeds or sunflower seeds. Wait patiently and quietly for a chipmunk to come jump in the trap to have a feast. Then release the box. What will happen is he will probably try to jump out of the hole and escape, but because of all the bird food under him, he won't be able to jump because there is no support, and he'll be trapped.

, Chipmunks can chew through cardboard, so if you don't want it to escape the trap, you'll need an extra layer of protection.Get a large plastic box, one large enough to fit over the hole. Place it over the hole and place rocks or books on top of it to secure it.

Determine what you intend to hunt.,
Choose the right rifle action for you.,
Pick a rifle made from the right materials.,
Read reviews online.",How to Buy a Hunting Rifle2," Different types of game often require different types of firearms to hunt effectively. Larger game such as moose or bear will require a higher caliber weapon. Small game like rabbits or squirrels require a smaller caliber weapon to prevent damaging the meat too much to eat.For most medium to large game, a rifle designed to shoot .30-06 Springfield, .308 Winchester or .270 Winchester ammunition are all good choices.
For small game, .22 or .223 caliber rifles are a better choice.

, Rifle action is the term used to describe how a rifle ejects a fired cartridge and loads a new one. There are a number of designs to choose from when it comes to rifle action, including breach loading, bolt-action, lever-action, semi-automatic and more. First, determine if you would like your rifle to fire a single shot before manually loading a new cartridge or multiple shots. Then choose a form of action within those two categories.Bolt-action, breach loader, and trap door action rifles all fire one shot before the hunter must take action to load the next round.
Semi-automatic rifles can continually fire until the magazine or clip runs out of ammunition.
Some hunters prefer the increased challenge of single shot rifles, but semi-automatic rifles are often a better choice for beginners.

, Hunting rifles come in a broad range of price points. While it’s possible to purchase a good quality hunting rifle for fairly little, you often get what you pay for in terms of the materials the rifle is made of. Lower quality materials will require more maintenance and upkeep to prevent them from rusting or becoming unserviceable, while higher quality materials will be able to fire more rounds and last longer without service or replacement.Stainless steel barrels and other rifle components can raise the price of the rifle, but offer a higher degree of reliability and resistance to rust.
Carbon steel is often used in lower cost hunting rifles. While these are not necessarily a bad option, they will require more upkeep to prevent them from rusting.
Stocks made from wood and fiberglass are both good choices. Walnut tends to be the most durable option in wood stocks.

, Once you have determined the caliber and action of the rifle as well as the materials you want it to be made from, go online and do some research into rifles that fit your qualifications. There are many rifle makers that offer a wide variety in hunting rifles. Like cars, some designs can be more reliable than others and certain makes and models may have issues you should be aware of.Read reviews you find about rifles that fit your criteria and assess the rifle’s positive and negative attributes.
Like cars, it can be difficult to find one rifle that does everything well. A racecar is not good off road and trucks tend not to win races. Look for a rifle that does what you want well, but understand that it may be difficult to find the “perfect” rifle.

Take a hunter safety course.,
Apply for a firearm permit.,
Research laws pertaining to second-hand gun sales in your area.,
Apply for a hunting license.",How to Buy a Hunting Rifle3," Many places require hunter to attend a hunter safety course before they are eligible to purchase a firearm or apply for a hunting license. If your area does not require it, the information and experience you can gain in a hunter safety course is still well worth the time and investment.You can find hunter safety courses in your area on websites like http://huntinfo.org/

Hunter safety courses often introduce you to different types of hunting rifles. This will give you the opportunity to experience different rifles before making a purchase.

, In some areas, you must apply for a firearm license in order to purchase any sort of firearm or ammunition. Go to the website for your local government to research what the requirements are in your area. Many places have different levels of firearm permits ranging from simply owning a firearm to concealed carry permits.Apply for the level of firearm license you need to purchase a hunting rifle.
You will likely be subjected to a background check and brief questionnaire in order to apply.

, You may choose to purchase your first hunting rifle second hand in order to reduce costs. While this is a common practice among hunters, each state has different laws governing the sale of firearms between private parties. You may need to have a licensed firearm dealer oversee the exchange or provide documentation to the local government.Some states have specific forms to complete when selling a firearm between private parties.
In some places, you will need to undergo a federal background check in order to buy a firearm from another private party just as you would at a store.

, In order to go hunting, you will need a hunting license issued by the state you will be hunting in. Depending on the game you choose to hunt, you will likely also need to purchase tags indicating how many of that animal you are permitted to hunt.Many places require the completion of a hunter’s safety course to apply for a hunting license.
You can often apply for and purchase your hunting license at hunting retail stores.

Confirm that the deer is dead .,
Make the first incision on the belly.,
Remove most of the abdominal organs.",How to Clean a Deer1," If needed, shoot it again. Do not approach a wounded deer on foot.;
, Lay the deer carcass on its back with legs spread. Locate the sternum or breastbone. Use a sharp knife to make an incision down the belly, from just below its sternum to its genitals. Your incision should be deep enough to cut the hide and the peritoneum (the thin membrane found just below the skin and over the organs). But be careful to not cut too deep. If you cut too deep you may puncture the organs and taint the meat .


After the initial incision near the sternum, make the rest of the cut with the knife blade facing up. This helps prolong the blade's life (as it is not cutting through the fur) and minimizes the chances of you accidentally puncturing an organ .

, Use a small sharp knife to free the abdominal organs from any membranous adhesions. Once cut free, use your hands to remove the bladder, kidneys, liver, spleen, pancreas, and internal genitalia.


When removing the bladder be careful that you do not spill any contents. To prevent any urine spilling, pinch off the bladder with one hand and slowly cut it free and remove the bladder with the other hand .
Take special care to not accidentally cut the intestines or the spleen, as their spilled contents will ruin meat.

Find a natural opening on a rabbit trail for best results.,
Cut down a large tree branch or a small tree to further funnel any rabbits into your snare.,
Place the tree branch over the rabbit trail, making sure that the bare strip of branch is centered over the trail.,
Drive small stakes of wood into the ground at both the sides of the snare.,
Take thin copper or brass wire and tie a small loop at one end.,
Cut the other end of the wire after approximately 2 feet (.6 m).

,
Feed the cut end of the wire through the loop end, creating a small noose.,
Attach the standing end of the noose onto the tree or tree branch that you placed over the rabbit trail.,
Place two more small sticks into the ground in an ""X"" pattern at the bottom of the snare.,
Mark the location of the snare with some red fabric and check the snare every day.",How to Catch a Wild Rabbit1," You're going to want to place your snare along a path that rabbits use, or else you're hoping that a rabbit will magically appear in your trap. A natural rabbit trail will ensure that rabbits pass through the general area that your snare is in.


Finding a natural opening of a rabbit trail is easier to do during winter. Look for telltale rabbit tracks in the snow when determining what parts of the forest rabbits go through.;
, Any type of tree will do, as long as it has branches. After cutting down the tree or tree branch, chop off any limbs around a foot-long (.3 m) strip in the middle of the branch.


Make sure the tree or tree branch is large enough to hold onto the rabbit. While rabbits are neither strong nor big, they can make away with a tree branch that is too small, making tracking more difficult.

, The limbs and branches you cut off will lead the rabbit away from the sides and into the center of the snare.

, Do this at points where the rabbit is likely to slip underneath the branch, away from the center of the snare.

, About 1 1/2 inches from the end of the wire, make a small (~3 cm) loop by leaving a hole and then twisting the end of the wire in on itself four or five times.


If you don't have thin wire, you can also use sturdy string, but know that some rabbits will gnaw through the rope. All in all, using wire is a more humane way to kill a rabbit.

,, When the rabbit hops into the noose, struggling will only tighten the noose even more onto the body part, strangling the rabbit. This is how this snare works.

, Attach it to the tree by wrapping it around the tree several times, and then finally in a simple knot around the wire itself, to ensure that it doesn't accidentally slip.


How far up off the ground should the noose be? Although it's contested, many trappers advise placing the noose anywhere from 4 to 6 inches off the ground. If keeping the noose 4 to 6 inches off the ground doesn't allow you enough room to tie the standing end around the tree branch, start over again, this time with more length on the wire.
Make sure also that the noose is completely in the center of the snare. A noose that's off to one side or another will make trapping the rabbit much harder.

, This will keep the rabbit from slipping in underneath the noose.

, If you don't check the snare often, the rabbit could be eaten by a fox or a bird before you have time to harvest it.

Access the thoracic organs.,
Remove the thoracic organs.",How to Clean a Deer2," After most of the organs are removed from the abdominal cavity, it is time to clean out the thoracic or upper chest cavity. To access the thoracic cavity, use a sharp knife to cut through the muscle (diaphragm) and membrane that separates the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity .


Expect to find a lot of blood when you cut into the thoracic cavity.
Be careful when working in the thoracic cavity. If the deer was shot in the chest there may be sharp broken ribs.

, Use a small sharp knife to free the thoracic organs from any membranous adhesions. Follow the trachea (windpipe) up as far as you can and cut it free . Once cut free, use your hands to remove the lungs and the heart.

Free the top of the digestive tract.,
Free the bottom of the digestive tract .,
Pull the digestive tract out.",How to Clean a Deer3," The digestive tract, is the continuous tube through which food travels, and consists of the esophagus, the stomach, the intestines and the rectum. The digestive tract is best removed in one piece. To remove the digestive tract in one piece, you will need to free both ends. To free the top end or esophagus (swallowing tube leading to the stomach), reach up into the chest cavity as far as you can and sever the esophagus . Then pull this end down, through the chest and out.

, Next you need to free the lower end of the digestive tract or rectum/anus. To do this cut a deep ring around a buck's anus, or a deep ring around a doe's anus and vagina. Stuff the now freed rectum back into the body cavity, and out through the stomach incision.


The cut around the anus should circumscribe the anus but not cut the anus. The goal is to free the anus from the surrounding tissue, while leaving the digestive tract, including rectum, intact. Your cut around the anus should be about 4 inches (10.2 cm) deep.

, Now that both ends of the digestive tract are free you can roll the intact digestive tract out of the body cavity.


As you handle the digestive tract, be careful not to cut the intestines, or squeeze fecal matter out. Spilled fecal matter will taint the meat. You may choose to tie off the rectum to minimize spillage.

Save edible organs.,
Dispose of waste.,
Take your deer home.",How to Clean a Deer4," You may choose to eat the heart and liver. However, it is not recommended that you consume the brain, spleen, eyes, tonsils, or lymph nodes. Put any organs you plan on saving in a clean plastic bag.

, If it is okay with the property owner, you may leave the waste organs (intestines, spleen, etc) for scavengers. Otherwise, pack up the organs in another plastic bag to bring with you.

, Transport your deer home. Get your carcass chilled, or on ice, as soon as possible.

Understand federal law.,
Read your state law.,
Confirm that you can apply for post-conviction relief.,
Meet with a lawyer.,
Apply for an expungement.,
Petition for the restoration of your civil rights.,
Ask for a pardon.,
Get the application.,
Gather supporting documents.,
Complete the application.,
File the application.,
Be interviewed, if required.,
Receive a certificate or certified order.",How to Get Gun Rights Back," Currently, the federal Gun Control Act prohibits anyone from selling or disposing of a gun to anyone convicted of a felony. By law, in order to get your gun rights restored, you would need to submit an application to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF). However, the BATF is not currently processing applications.


Nevertheless, you can still qualify under the Gun Control Act to get your firearm rights back if you get one of the following forms of post-conviction relief:you have your conviction expunged
you have your civil rights restored
you are pardoned


Furthermore, the expungement, restoration of civil rights, or pardon must also allow you get your gun rights back. This will depend on your state.;
, If you were convicted of a state crime, then you can seek a pardon, expungement, or restoration of your civil rights from your Governor. You must find out whether or not you can get this post-conviction relief along with the right to possess a firearm.


For example, your state may be willing to pardon you but not let you have a gun. In this situation, you will not be able to get your federal gun rights back even though you have a pardon.According to the Gun Control Act, you can qualify for restoration of your gun rights only if the pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rights does not expressly bar the right to ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.If your state makes post-conviction relief contingent on not possessing a gun, then you cannot get your gun rights back.
If you were convicted of a federal crime, then there are few opportunities for expungement. Instead, you must seek a pardon from the President of the United States.

, States have strict requirements that must be met in order to qualify for a pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rights. You need to check whether you can apply for any of those forms of post-conviction relief. To find your state law, you can visit your local law library or search the Internet.


As an example of restrictions: some states will not expunge a DUI. Accordingly, if you were convicted of a DUI, then the only way you can get your gun rights back is to seek either a pardon or a restoration of your civil rights.
You should get the court papers for all of your convictions so that you can see exactly what crimes you were convicted of. You cannot have any disqualifying conviction. Ask your attorney for copies of your court papers, or stop into the courthouse where you were convicted and get copies.

, Because this area of law is complicated, you should meet with a lawyer. Only a qualified post-conviction attorney can properly advise you on the best approach for getting your gun rights back. When you meet with a lawyer, explain your situation. He or she will let you know if, under state and federal law, you can get your gun rights restored. Ask the attorney which form of post-conviction relief you can apply for.


To find a qualified attorney, you can visit your state’s bar association website, which should host a referral program.
You can also ask the defense attorney who represented you in your criminal case for a recommendation. Lawyers know the reputations of other attorneys and can recommend a qualified lawyer.

, Before applying for the restoration of your gun rights, you need to receive post-conviction relief. An expungement is a form of relief that will seal your arrest and conviction records, thereby making them disappear.States have different requirements and processes, but generally the following applies:


You must qualify for an expungement. Generally, states are more willing to expunge misdemeanor convictions rather than felony convictions. However, many states will expunge some felonies.You will need to find your state’s expungement law on the Internet and see if you qualify.
You must wait a sufficient amount of time. Depending on the offense, you cannot apply for the expungement until a certain amount of time has passed.Generally, the more serious the offense, the more time you must wait.
Get an application. You will need to fill out an application or a petition in order to apply for an expungement. In it, you will need to list the dates of your convictions. You also will need to provide certified copies of your court papers.
You may or may not have to attend a hearing to answer questions.
For more information, see Expunge Your Criminal Records.

, Instead of an expungement, you could apply for restoration of your civil rights. Your civil rights include your right to vote, to serve on a jury, and to run for public office. As with an expungement, states have different requirements. You petition your state’s Clemency Board by filling out an application.


Find your state’s requirements by searching on the Internet or by meeting with a lawyer. In many states, your civil rights will be automatically restored after the completion of your sentence if you are a first-time offender. In other states, only some rights (such as the right to vote) will be automatically restored; you must apply for restoration of the others.You can apply by filling out your state’s application, listing your felony convictions and the dates of your sentence. You will need certified court papers from the courthouse where you were convicted.
For more information, see Restore Civil Rights.

, Alternately, you may need to get a pardon. If you were convicted of breaking a state law, then you must apply to the Governor of your state for a pardon. You would apply to the President for a pardon from a federal conviction.The pardon process requires that you fill out an application, get letters of reference, and potentially speak at a pardon hearing.You can find the requirements for your state or the federal government by searching online or by visiting your local law library, which should be held at your county’s courthouse. The requirements for a pardon can be strict. You must wait a certain amount of time after the completion of your sentence and convince a Pardon Board that you deserve the pardon.However, if you do not qualify for an expungement or restoration of your civil rights, then a pardon may be your only option.
You will also need letters of recommendations from people who can attest to your good character. You can get them from employers, faith leaders, or leaders of volunteer organizations.
Pardons are discretionary. The Governor (or President) does not have to give you a pardon even if you meet the eligibility criteria. Instead, they will generally look to see that you have rehabilitated yourself through employment and community service.For more information on how to apply for a pardon, see Apply for a Pardon.

, Once you have received your expungement, restoration of civil rights, or pardon, you then need to apply to have your gun rights restored. Your state should have an application. Many states have uploaded their applications onto the web. You can then download the form and fill it out, or complete the form online and then print it off.


In some states, you may have to petition a court. Virginia, for example, requires those who have had their civil rights restored to petition the circuit court in the city or county where they live to have their gun rights restored.To petition the court, stop in and ask the court clerk if there is a form for you to use. Alternately, your attorney could draft this petition for you.

, Depending on your state, you will need various forms of supporting documentation. For example, you will probably need copies of your arrest/offense reports, which you can get from the law enforcement agency that arrested you.You will probably also need certified court documents, such as the Complaint/Indictment, Judgment, and Sentence Order. You can get these from the clerk at the courthouse where you were convicted.
Proof that you have paid any fine or restitution ordered by the court. The court clerk should be able to provide the statement to this effect.
You also might need an official criminal history statement from the sheriff of the county in which you reside., You should either type the information into your application or print neatly in black ink. Answer all questions, writing “N/A” for anything that is not applicable. Each state’s application is different, but you will generally be asked for the following information:current name and any name you were convicted under
any aliases
your race and sex
date and place of birth
driver’s license number
current and previous addresses
whether you have children and if you pay child support
your employment history
your criminal history, including your prison ID number
the reasons why you want the restoration of your firearm rights
what rehabilitation efforts you have undertaken

, Send the completed application to the address provided. Mail the application certified mail, return receipt requested. The receipt will serve as proof that the application was received by the appropriate office.


Be sure to make a copy for your records. If the application is lost, then you can refer to your copy.
There may be a fee to apply. If there is, then you will be told the amount on the form. If you have to file a petition in state court, then the clerk will tell you the amount of the fee. In North Carolina, by way of example, you will have to pay $200 to file the petition., The state may want to interview you before restoring your gun rights. Alternately, if your state requires that you file a petition in court, then you will probably have to attend a hearing before a judge.


At the hearing, the judge will make sure that you meet the state criteria for getting your gun rights back. Notice will probably also be sent to the District Attorney’s office. If the District Attorney disagrees with your application to get firearm rights restored, then he or she can come to the hearing and present evidence explaining that position., If the state board grants you your gun rights, then they will probably send you a certificate to that effect. Where a judge orders the rights restored, you can get a certified order.The state (or court clerk) should forward notice to the sheriff’s department that your gun rights have been restored. Furthermore, they should send notice to the national instant criminal background check system index.Check with the court clerk or state board to confirm how this information is relayed.
When notice is received by the national background check system, then you will no longer show up in the system as a felon prohibited from purchasing a gun. Accordingly, you will then be able to purchase a gun from a licensed seller.

Dig out a large enough hole.,
Gather several sticks that are just wider than the hole.,
Going in a perpendicular direction, lay very small twigs across the sticks.,
Carefully lay dead foliage over the top of the trap, covering the sticks entirely.

,
Carefully cover the foliage with dirt, blending the trap into its surroundings.,
Place bait on top of the trap (optional).,
Mark the location of the snare with some red fabric and check the snare every day.",How to Catch a Wild Rabbit2," Depending on the size of rabbit you're catching, your hole should probably be several feet deep and several feet wide. The deeper your hole, the lower the chance that any fallen rabbit could climb back out.


Place the hole either in the middle of a rabbit trail or someplace where you image rabbits to be. If you don't place the trap in the middle of a trail, you'll need to lure a rabbit over onto the pit trap using bait.

, Getting the right width is important. Too large and your pitfall trap won't trigger when a rabbit steps over it. Too small and you'll never be able to make your trap stand up. Gather three or four of these kind of sticks. Lay them across the width of the trap.

, Try to get a crosshatch pattern going — three or four big sticks going in one direction and lots of small twigs going in the other direction.

,, If the surroundings are varied, make sure to vary the top of the dirt. Try also to harvest old dirt and place it on top, so that the dirt doesn't look freshly-dug.

, Place corn, carrots, or other vegetables on top of the trap to lure the rabbit onto the trap. Try placing the bait in the middle of the trap so that the rabbit has to step onto the center of the pit trap in order to activate it.

, Mark the trap so that you can locate it again quickly and efficiently. Remember to check the trap every day so that if you do catch a rabbit, you won't cause it to unnecessarily suffer while it's in captivity.

Purchase or obtain a live trap.,
Find food to place onto the trap mechanism.,
Pick up the door and lock it into place, setting the trap.,
Check the trap frequently for caught rabbits.,
Once caught, release the rabbit or do with it as you please.",How to Catch a Wild Rabbit3," A live trap usually contains a trap door, a trap mechanism, and pulleys. It can be found online or at your local farm and feed store. It is primarily used to catch rabbits while keeping them alive.

, Again, corn, carrots, vegetables, or bread should be sufficient to lure rabbits into the trap, after which the trap door gets activated and the rabbit is caught.


Be sure to place the food directly on the trap mechanism. If it's improperly placed, there's a good chance your rabbit could slip loose with a full belly and you'll have nothing to show for it.

, Follow the directions that come with the live trap in order to set it. Make sure that the trap activates by probing the trap mechanism with a long stick. If the trap doesn't activate, be sure to set it again until it does.

, Any caught rabbits shouldn't be able to hurt themselves in the trap, but it's humane to check for a catch at least every 24 hours.

, Be sure to wear protective gloves if you do catch a rabbit. Though they are generally harmless, they could try to bite you in your effort to set them free.

, Tie the branch somewhere not higher than 50 inches. At the other end of the branch, tie the branch onto something else. Then, in the middle of the branch, tie a rope that is three inches long.

, Put the string through one of the holes.

, Do this by putting your hand inside in the box, put the string in the other hole from inside the box. Make sure you place the box in an isolated area. Take your hand out of the box and pull the string you got out from inside the box and tie the string to the other string with 3 knots.

, Connect the thread with the string and make two holes in the top of the box.

,, The carrot has to be 3 or 4 inches high. When the rabbit jumps up and pulls the carrot down with its paws, the thin sewing thread will break and the box will fall over the rabbit.

Always keep the muzzle pointed in a safe direction.,
Assume that the firearm is always loaded.,
Keep your finger off the trigger.,
Be sure of your target and everything that is downrange.,
Always hand a firearm to someone unloaded.,
Use the proper ammunition.,
Wear ear and eye protection.,
If your gun doesn’t fire when the trigger is pulled, be cautious.,
Be sure the firearm's barrel, chamber, and action are clear of obstruction before firing.,
Maintain your firearm properly.,
Proper modification of the firearm.,
Learn the safety and firing characteristics of the firearm.,
Never shoot hard or flat surfaces (including water).,
Never allow your loaded firearm out of your control.,
Never mix alcohol or drugs with firearms.",How to Handle a Firearm Safely,"


This rule surpasses all other rules. It is a very simple concept, if the firearm is pointed in a safe direction, intentional or accidental discharge will not harm anyone. The safest direction should be chosen, so humans, animals, then inanimate objects are all taken into account.
This also includes being sure that when you carry the firearm you are able to fully control the muzzle direction and angle, especially if you are walking, or otherwise traveling (in case you trip or stumble, this is also helped by Rule 3).;
,


Even if the firearm is known to be unloaded, it should be treated with the respect of a loaded gun. For example, even though you've just triple checked and know it is unloaded, you still don’t point it at people (follow Rule 1 at all times).

,


This prevents any accidental discharges from a trigger pull. With a pistol, there is usually an area above the trigger where you can rest your trigger finger (they often call this the ""index point""). For rifles or other guns, it is best to remove your whole hand from the area where the trigger is. There are plenty of other safe ways to carry the gun.
Along with this, it should be emphasized to not rely on the firearm's safety. While human error is many times more likely to cause a problem, the safety can fail, and pulling the trigger may result in an accidental discharge.
Certain pistols don't have manual safeties at all. In this case, they often have safeties integrated into the trigger, back strap (or grip), or hammer. These types of guns are especially dangerous around inexperienced users. But training and aggressive execution of safety techniques can overcome many of the dangers of a safety-less firearm.
Once you are on the line to shoot, do not put your finger on the trigger until you have pointed in on the target. This may be a difficult habit to break as you may feel it is natural to have your finger on the trigger once you think you are wanting to shoot.

,


This is important. Now that you have reached the point where you can fire, you want to be absolutely sure of what your target is, and what is behind it. In many cases the bullet fired can go through the target and out the other side. Anything downrange is important to watch. Bullets may strike an intended or unintended target and bounce, ricochet, or otherwise change direction.
Be sure, if you are shooting with others around, that you do not stand behind anyone when you fire. Not only is this unsafe, but it is discourteous. Anyone shooting should be side by side. This prevents accidental shootings, it also prevents someone from being startled by the muzzle blast from the firearm. Even small guns like a .22 LR pistol can put out a blast to make a grown man jump. And anything in front or to the sides of the muzzle can feel it. Larger caliber firearms can actually cause headaches or damage just from the muzzle blast.

,


If you hand a firearm to someone it should be unloaded. Check the magazine and the chamber. When the firearm is not going to be used immediately, it should be unloaded in the same manner. If you receive a firearm from someone, you should check the magazine and chamber to make sure the gun is not loaded, until you intend to fire.
A good way to let yourself, and anyone around you, know the gun is unloaded is by locking the bolt, slide, or cylinder in the open position. This makes it so that, even if the trigger is pulled, no bullet will fire.
Check the manual for the firearm. It will generally mention the safest way to carry or unload the firearm.
When not using the firearm or while transporting it, you should always unload the firearm. In many locales, there are laws against carrying a loaded firearm in a vehicle without the proper permits, even if just transporting it to and from a firing range or repair shop.

Using improper ammunition for your firearm can not only damage or destroy your firearm, but can also cause serious injury or even death. The firearm is specifically designed for one specific caliber or gauge and possibly even a specific load of ammunition. Overly-reloaded or improperly hand-loaded cartridges or shells can be a danger and detriment to the firearm, the shooter, and others around the firearm. An improper detonation in a firearm which disables the firearm is known by many as a ""kaBoom"" or ""kB!"" for short.
For example: though a .40 S&W caliber cartridge may load into a .45 ACP magazine, placing the smaller round into the gun makes the unsupported casing blow out of the gun, or blow apart throwing shrapnel from the gun. Some pistols are known to have kB!s from reloaded or hand loaded ammunition. A couple of common guns are the M1911 and Glocks in .40 S&W (both are known to do it with ""hot"", over loaded ammunition). These failures are due to the internal design of the weapons and cannot be compensated for.
Manufactured ammunition is usually best. They have tested the loads and pressures many times with expensive machines. They invariably put out the most consistent loadings. In general, the more expensive ammunition is more consistent, but that is not always the case. Match-grade ammunition is specifically measured and engineered to be as consistent as possible. It is also usually the most expensive ammunition.
Powder loads are also important to pay attention to. Both 9x19mm (9mm Luger Parabellum) and .45 ACP (and other cartridges) have rounds known as ""TAP"" or other nicknames by companies, these are known as ""hot"" rounds. They have extra powder which results in higher chamber pressures. The next step up is ""+P"", and 9x19mm cartridges can also come in ""+P+"". Each step up causes greater chamber pressures which also results in higher muzzle velocities for the rounds. But many pistols are unable to shoot ""+P"" reliably, without damaging parts. Dual-stage recoil springs are a good indicator that a pistol is able to shoot the ""hot"" loads without a problem, but asking the manufacturer and checking the manual is the best way to ensure you are not damaging your weapon or putting yourself at risk.
For rifles such as the .223 Remington, there are additional considerations as well. The 5.56x45mm NATO rounds are the exact same dimensions as the .223 Remington rounds. However, the general rule of thumb is this: if the weapon is advertised as a .223, do not fire 5.56x45mm ammunition through it. There are different types or receiver/chamber specifications. Most .223 rifles have the SAAMI-spec chamber which is not the same as the Mil-Spec chamber, as would be on an M16 or other military-type rifles. The SAAMI is designed to be highly accurate, but not as durable as the Mil-Spec, which gives up tolerances for pressure resistance and reliability. Mil-Spec chambers are able to shoot .223 rounds fine (though less accurately), but NOT vice versa.
The .308 Winchester and the 7.62x51mm NATO rounds are the same. So no precautions are needed in this case.

,


For many small caliber rifles ear protection is not completely necessary, but it is highly recommended. While the sound from small caliber fire may not cause pain, it still has a potential to damage your hearing. When shooting anything larger than a .22 LR, it is strongly suggested that you use ear protection, especially during extended use. Ringing in your ears after a shot is fired is a sign that your ears are exceeding their percussive limitations and possibly causing permanent damage.
Eye protection is a must. Even though you may be confident that there are no problems with your firearm, small problems can arise from your firearm heating up from firing, or from ammunition defects. There is also the problem of flying brass (spent cartridges) hitting you in the eye. Another problem usually presents itself with larger calibers or pistols with very short (less than three inch) barrels; there may be unburned powder flying through the air, or even bouncing off the back of the bullet just fired, which can then be redirected toward you.

,


When the trigger is pulled, and there is no ""boom,"" think to make sure you had a round in the chamber. If you are absolutely sure you did not have one in the chamber, fix the problem. If you think there was a cartridge in the chamber, hold the gun, pointed toward the target. You can try firing the gun again (if it is a double-action gun), try this once, maybe twice, and if nothing happens still, keep the gun pointed at the target for about 20 seconds. If the round still does not fire, carefully remove the magazine (if possible) and eject the round out of the chamber. Place the dud cartridge in a safe area (away from humans, valuables or other ammunition).
The problem is usually due to a dud primer, and is much more common in hand-loaded ammunition than manufactured ammunition (see rule 6).

,


Anything caught in the barrel can cause major damage to your barrel and/or firearm; it can even cause a kB! Obstructions in the chamber can cause the round not to load properly, or not load at all. It can also cause extraction and ejection problems which drastically reduce the reliability of the gun. An action impediment can prevent the hammer of the firearm from hitting the round (or firing pin) or prevent it from drawing again to fire another round.

,


Maintenance is a big concern when owning a firearm. The older the firearm the more important it can become. In general, the firearm should be cleaned after each use. Some firearm manufacturers recommend the wearing of eye protection prior to field stripping the weapon. This may help prevent any eye injuries resulting from inadvertently ""launching"" springs or other components when field stripping the weapon.
Pistols should be, at minimum, ""field stripped"" (if possible), cleaned with a cloth and/or brush and solvent. The barrel should be brushed out with a barrel brush. There will likely be a lot of carbon and powder build up in the chamber, so a pick and more solvent can be used there. Once that is done, wipe again with a clean cloth (to remove all solvent). Each moving part should be lubricated with gun oil (except the firing pin of semi-auto pistols which can become gummed up with grime and carbon collected by the oil). The exterior of the barrel and the slide rail guides especially (on the slide and the frame) should also be lubricated. Using too much oil, though, may encourage powder and carbon buildup in those areas. Once done, wipe the externals down with a clean cloth to remove any excess oil and pull the slide back a few times to work some of the oil around.
Field stripping rifles and shotguns for cleaning are usually a bit more difficult or complex. Alternatively, a brush with solvent can be used to clean the action and chamber without much, or any, dismantling. Wipe as much down with a clean cloth as possible. Use barrel solvent to clean the barrel best, or a bore snake can work very well too. Oil the trigger assembly (according to the manual), and oil, with gun oil, the bolt and action. Pull the bolt back and forth a few times to work the oil in. Wipe any excess oil off with a clean cloth.
If the firearm is not to be fired for a significant amount of time, it is best to do a very thorough cleaning before storage. There are products on the market designed to protect your firearm for many years (decades if needed), but these are not recommended for storage over only a few years (or less). It is best to properly clean, then oil your firearm (maybe over-oil the firearm). Every 6-8 months, the firearm should be taken out and oiled again (maybe cleaned too if there is dust build up). With plenty of oil and a good initial cleaning, the firearm should stay in perfect condition. Storage in a dry area would help too, but the oil should displace and protect against moisture on your firearm. After not using the firearm for an extended period of time, it is best to clean and re-oil it before use.

,


While many recommend not modifying your firearm (this has the greatest chance of keeping your warranty and your firearm reliable), it can be done in a proper way. It is generally best to let the factory do all your modifications, but this is not always possible. A certified gunsmith with your firearm's manufacturer's certification would be the next best choice. If you do not have many gunsmiths in your area or none of them are certified by the manufacturer of your firearm, it is probably best not to have your firearm modified. Never do any modification yourself. Changes to your firearm which are done improperly could permanently damage the firearm, and can cause problems such as a kB! when fired.

,


Learning how to use a firearm safely is paramount. Learn how to unload the magazine (if available), unload and check the chamber, engage the safety (if available), clear jams, examine the barrel, and field strip (if available) the firearm.
Firing characteristics are also a key component of knowing the firearm you are using. If you are unaware about certain aspects of the gun such as the amount of kick from a firearm, ask someone who is knowledgeable with that specific firearm. Be sure you are able to consistently operate the firearm safely.

,


While some objects may seem tantalizing to shoot, many metallic or other hard and/or flat objects can be very dangerous to shoot. These objects, including water, can cause the bullet to bounce or ricochet in unexpected and dangerous directions. They are even able to bounce back toward or near the shooter.
Smaller, low velocity bullets (such as the .22 LR) are very well known for their ability to ricochet. Due to their light weight and low velocity, things like wood, rocks, or even dirt can cause the bullet to ricochet. Refer to Rule 4.
One piece of good news about ricochets is the fact that (in general) bullets do not bounce (as a ball would), because of the extreme velocities (of even low velocity bullets) and because the soft lead bullets tend to follow relatively parallel paths to the plane of the object that has been hit. Thus, where the shooter is standing, is usually the safest place to be when a ricochet occurs. There are exceptions to this, such as solid core bullets (no lead core) which change the dynamics of the bullet, rubber can cause a bullet to bounce straight back, and hard objects which are angled can cause the bullet to wrap around back toward the shooter.

,


If you have a loaded firearm, never leave it unattended. This is while at the range and your home. If you can't be certain of its status or who may have access to it, it is best to unload the firearm, lock the firearm with a slide lock (for a pistol) or lock the firearm in a hard case or a safe. For optimal safety, keep the ammunition in a separate area, locked up as well.
Be sure to follow all state and local laws regarding firearm storage. Some states do not require firearms to be locked away, but keep in mind that there are children or others who may obtain access to your firearms or ammunition.

,


Even the slightest bit of alcohol or drugs (even prescription drugs) can impair or alter your judgment of even common or simple things. This combination can be a lethal dose to yourself or others around you when involving firearms. Never, under any circumstances, use a firearm while not completely sober.

Make adjustments.",How to Build a Longbow2," Put the bottom tip of the bow on the top of your foot and hold the top of the bow with your hand. Use your other hand to push out the center of the bow a few inches. Observe where the bow bends and where it does not.

, Using a knife, cut off wood from the inside of the bow where it does not bend. By removing wood, you will increase the flexibility of the stiff areas. Keep testing the flexibility of the bow until it bends in a uniform shape, both above and below the handhold.


Only cut wood from the inside. Leave the outside of the bow untouched.
The handhold and tips should remain relatively straight compared to the rest of the bow.
The amount of carving required will vary greatly depending on how thick the stave is.

Cut a notch on each side of each tip.,
Prepare the string.,
Hang the bow horizontally on from an elevated position.,
Pull the bowstring a few inches.",How to Build a Longbow3," These notches will be used to string the bow. They only need to be deep enough to hold the string in place.


Be sure not to cut all the way into the outside of the bow.

, Tie loops to both ends of a length of nylon. The bowstring should be 5 to 6 inches (12.7 to 15.2 cm) from the handhold when the bow is complete.


Bend the bow and loop the nylon onto each notch.
Do not pull back on the string yet, the bow is not complete and could break.

, Rest the bow on the center handhold, with the string perpendicular to the ground.


Use a tree branch or a piece of scrap wood to hang the bow from.

, Check and see how the bow bends. Ideally, both sides will bend the same, at the same angle.


Make adjustments by removing wood from the inside of the bow where it is not bending enough
Continue to make adjustments and pull the string back a bit more each time. Do this until you reach the draw length. Your draw length is the distance from the string at rest to your upper chin. This is how far back you would pull to shoot.

Shoot.",How to Get an Automatic and Correct Flash Sight Picture and an Automatic and Correct Sight Picture With P&S2," The US Army's FM 23-35 - Combat Training With Pistols & Revolvers (2003), states that: ""The soldier should use his sights when engaging the enemy unless this would place the weapon within arm's reach of the enemy.""

, The field manual also states that: ""Usually, when engaging an enemy at pistol range, the firer has little time to ensure a correct sight picture....""

, ""As the soldier raises the weapon to eye level, his point of focus switches from the enemy to the front sight, ensuring that the front and rear sights are in proper alignment left and right, but not necessarily up and down.

, ""Pressure is applied to the trigger as the front sight is being acquired, and the hammer falls as the ""Flash Sight Picture"" is confirmed.

"
"
Point.,
Lock up the wrist.,
There will be no need to take the time to find and focus on the sights, and then check and adjust as needed for a correct Flash Sight Picture, and then shoot, because you will already have a correct Flash Sight Picture.

,
If by some happy chance, you can see and focus on the sights, you can still use them if you wish to, and have the time to do that.

",How to Get an Automatic and Correct Flash Sight Picture and an Automatic and Correct Sight Picture With P&S3," P&S calls for placing the index finger along the side of the gun and using it to aim with by pointing it at a target, and pulling the trigger with the middle finger.


When the index finger is extended along the side of a gun, the barrel and sights will be in parallel with it, and the sights will be in proper alignment. And they will stay in that proper alignment for each shot, as long as the index finger is along the side of the gun and in parallel with them.

, Also, extending the index finger along the side of the gun, helps to naturally ""lock up"" the wrist, strengthen the grip, and improve recoil control.

,,"
"
The Army's combat pistol manual states that '""everyone has the ability to point at an object.,
""Making the soldier aware of this ability and teaching him how to apply it results in success when engaging enemy targets in combat."",
""When a soldier points, he instinctively points at the feature on the object on which his eyes are focused.,
""When the eyes are shifted to a new object or feature, the finger, hand, and arm also shift to this point.,
So if you use P&S, you will get both an automatic and Correct Flash Sight Picture + an automatic and Correct Sight Picture.

,
Just point-n-pull, point-n-pull, point-n-pull.,
Your gun will be held in the natural, strong, and level shooting platform made up of your thumb, the web of your hand, and your index finger.,
Your thumb and index finger DO NOT have to be held aloof from the gun.

,
You can squeeze the trigger as hard and as often as you want.",How to Get an Automatic and Correct Flash Sight Picture and an Automatic and Correct Sight Picture With P&S4," Since pointing the forefinger at an object and extending the weapon toward a target are much the same, the combination of the two is natural.""

,

, An impulse from the brain causes the arm and hand to stop when the finger reaches the proper position.""

, It is this inherent trait that can be used by the soldier to engage targets rapidly and accurately.""

,, No more, no less.

, Your ring and little fingers also help in gripping the gun, and they add tenacity to the grip.

Some courses are offered by local police departments, and some courses are offered by private companies.The basic firearm safety course will include the following:shooting practice and training
understanding the parts of the firearm

If you have any questions while completing the application, you should contact your local police department., If this is your first application, indicate that you are a new applicant by placing a check mark next to ""New Applicant"" at the top of the form. If this is for a renewal license, you will check “Renewal” and provide your most recent license number., For example, if you just want the license to purchase a firearm and keep it at home, then you need what is called an FID.

Each police department has some leeway in the documentation that they require with each application.


For example, some towns require a copy of your birth certificate, but other towns will accept different forms of identification.
Some towns may require written recommendations from your two reference people; other towns would only require their names and contact information.

, In any city or town, for a new license, you will need to submit proof that you have completed a firearms safety training course. Have a copy with you when you submit your application.

, All lawful residents of Massachusetts, regardless of official citizenship, are eligible to get a license to possess or carry a firearm in Massachusetts. There are some ways for a non-resident of Massachusetts to obtain a temporary gun license for a specific purpose. If this applies to you, then contact the police department for the city or town where you will be visiting., Your record does not need to be absolutely clean, but there are limitations. The state law is very clear that no gun license may be issued in Massachusetts to anyone who has been convicted of any of the crimes described below.

Before you shoot learn the four basic safety rules that apply to all firearms.,
Make sure that your gun is safe to shoot.,
Choose the correct ammunition for your purposes.,
Clean and maintain your gun before shooting.,
Obtain safety equipment for shooting.,
Pick a safe place to shoot.",How to Fire a Gun1," Guns are powerful, dangerous tools and they produce irreversible consequences - you cannot ""un-shoot"" something, least of all yourself. There are four generally accepted rules of gun safety; no matter where you go, professionals who work with guns will follow some variation upon these rules.



Treat every gun as if it were loaded and ready to fire. There are no exceptions to this rule, not even empty guns. It is very easy even for professional marksmen to forget whether or not a gun is ready to fire, and the consequences can be extremely serious. The best and only way to avoid problems of this type is to treat all guns at all times as if they were loaded and ready to fire.

Do not point the gun at anything you do not want to shoot. Do not point the gun at your friends, at parts of your body, at household pets, at the walls of your home, or at your TV, even if you think it is unloaded - remember rule 1!

Keep your finger off the trigger and the safety on at all times until your sights are coming up on target and you are ready to shoot. The trigger can be actuated accidentally with relatively little pressure - 7 to 8 pounds of pressure for typical military and police weapons, as little as 2 pounds or less for competition weapons. Train yourself to keep your finger straight and off the trigger every time you pick up a gun and at all times that you are holding it and not shooting it.

Always be aware of your target and what is behind it. Bullets go through things, missed shots go around things, and you must be responsible for every single projectile you shoot.

, Old guns or poorly maintained guns can be very dangerous. Keep in mind that your gun is essentially a chamber for explosions that go off right by your hand and your head! If necessary, strip down, clean and inspect your gun before shooting. If you are unsure if your gun is safe to fire, consult a professional gunsmith.

, Be very specific about the type of ammunition you are supposed to use in your weapon and do not vary from it.


Some guns have similar sounding calibers that are easily confused. For instance, 7.62 x 51 NATO, 7.62 x 54R, and 7.62 x 39 are all variously referred to as ""7.62"". When you purchase ammunition, make sure you are purchasing the correct type.
Many types of ammunition look very similar but will cause serious damage if fired in the wrong weapon, including destruction of the weapon and serious injury. For example, .222 Remington, .223 Remington and .556 NATO cartridges are all nearly identical to the naked eye and require a micrometer-scale measuring instrument to tell apart.
Some types of ammunition will fit into the magazines for other types of ammunition by design, as is the case with .300 AAC Blackout and .223 Remington/.556 NATO magazines. Be sure that you are using the correct caliber of ammunition, particularly if you are shooting more than one type of weapon.
Select the correct type of ammunition for your shooting. Some ammunition is made for practice shooting at the range; other ammunition is intended for action competition, long-range precision, hunting, or self-defense.
If you are shooting your gun for the first time, it is helpful to bring along a variety of different types of ammunition to get a sense for which type your gun might shoot reliably and accurately.

, Even if you are shooting a weapon you already own, it is a good practice to check it over and perform any necessary preventative maintenance and care services before you shoot it.


If you are a new gun owner, you should be aware that manufacturers often pack grease or cosmoline into weapons that is meant to be removed before use. Some guns may not function well or at all if they are shot before being cleaned.

, At a minimum, you will need ear and eye protection. Even small-caliber guns are easily loud enough to permanently damage your hearing, and they throw off unexpended powder, small particles of carbon and brass casings that can fly into your eyes and cause serious injury.


Many different types of ear protection are available, from simple inexpensive foam earplugs to expensive ""active"" hearing protection that allows you to hear normally while still damping out noise from gunshots. At the very least, unless you are shooting a suppressed weapon, you need earplugs.
There are many popular styles of shooting glasses that you can pick; shooting ranges will often have eye protection that you can borrow or rent.

, Shooting a firearm anywhere besides a shooting range is a serious crime in many places, in large part because bullets go very far and can easily accidentally injure or kill people. Remember Rule 4 - be aware of what you are shooting and what is behind it!


If you are able to shoot outdoors legally, remember to pick a location with a backstop like a tall hill or the side of a ravine that will absorb your bullets. Be careful not to point your weapon in any direction aside from towards your backstop.
If you shoot at a shooting range, read their rules carefully before you shoot and be careful to follow the basic safety rules above. It is very common for novice shooters to break rule 2 (where the gun is pointed) accidentally when removing their guns from cases as well as when turning to show the gun to friends (""Hey, look at this!"").

Make sure your rifle is in good condition before loading and firing it.,
Raise the bolt arm and pull the bolt back.

,
At your target range, insert ammunition into the magazine.,
Close the bolt.,
At this point, you can make the weapon safe by pulling the safety knob on the rear of the bolt back and twisting it counterclockwise.,
Pull the trigger.,
Check the impact location of the bullet.,
After you finish firing for the day, immediately run a swab through the barrel and chamber with Ammonia or Windex on it.,
Clean your weapon more thoroughly after you finish firing it.",How to Fire a Mosin Nagant Carbine," Many Mosin-Nagants on the market today are over 70 years old, and you must ensure that the barrel is free of obstructions and significant corrosion. Has a gunsmith checked the head space, or do you have the field ""head space"" gauges? Are the receiver and barrel both unblocked? Is everything clean? Check over everything before you even think about firing it.;
,, The Mosin-Nagant is a single shot, bolt action rifle with a top feed magazine which holds 5 rounds. Ammunition can be inserted into the magazine with a stripper clip, or fed in one at a time. Single rounds can also be loaded directly into the chamber. On the Stripper Clip, make sure that the rim on each cartridge is in front of the rim on the cartridge beneath it. The rifle can fail to chamber a new round if is not, even though there is a built in device to prevent such interference.

, Mosin-Nagants are typically a tight-actioned weapon, so make sure you use enough forward force to engage the bolt and push it down completely into the firing position. Often, the machining on surplus Mosin-Nagants was poor, so the bolt may be stubborn. Ignore the impulse to strike it with your hand. Instead, apply steady force to it until it breaks free.

, If safety is not engaged, align your sights exactly on your target.

, Make sure to pull straight back, not to the side. Additionally, try to use the fatty pad of your finger rather than the crease at the joint, as this improves accuracy.

, Adjust the elevation and windage of the sights accordingly.

, This will remove the ""salts"" that can pit them.

, This is especially true if you use most ammunition (surplus, up through mid-1970s), which is typically using Berdan Primers containing mercury perchlorate (this converts to salts after firing). However, some new ammo you buy from Wolf, etc. use non-corrosive Berdan or Boxer primers.

Re-acquaint yourself with the four rules of firearms safety.,
Load your handgun.,
Assume a firing grip and stance with your handgun.,
Bring your handgun to bear on the target and disengage the safety (if any).,
Focus on the front sight and put it where you want the bullet to go.,
Pull the trigger straight back to the rear while gripping the gun correctly and focusing on the front sight.,
When the ammunition is expended, add more ammunition as desired.",How to Fire a Gun2," You are about to use an extremely dangerous tool. Unlike weapons with stocks like the rifle and the shotgun, you control your handgun with only your hands and your wrists. This can make it very easy to accidentally break rule 2 (where your gun is pointing).;
, Depending on whether your handgun is a pistol or a revolver, this procedure will vary.


For a magazine-fed pistol like a 1911 or a Glock, you must insert bullets into the magazine, insert the magazine into the gun and then ""rack"" or pull and release the slide in order to cycle a bullet into the chamber and make the gun ready to fire. Keep your finger off the trigger while doing this!
For a revolver, insert your bullets either individually or using a clip if provided, and close the cylinder. Try not to slam the cylinder shut - this can cause damage to your revolver.

, Although different styles of handgun technique exist, most modern practical and competition training utilizes a modified isosceles shooting stance with a two-handed grip keeping the webbing of your thumb and forefinger high up on the back of the gun, but not so high that it begins to interfere with the slide or hammer of the revolver. In combination with locking the bones in your wrist, this technique makes it easy to absorb recoil and shoot the weapon rapidly and accurately.

, Not all handguns have manual safeties. Smith & Wesson M&P pistols and Glocks are common examples of guns lacking an external safety aside from the trigger. Other types of pistols such as the 1911 may not allow the slide to be racked if the safety is engaged.

, The sighting system on handguns requires that you focus on the front sight to ensure that you are aiming correctly. As long as the front sight is properly aligned with the notch in the rear sight, the bullet will go where you put the front sight.

, Focus on pulling smoothly and evenly to ensure that the weapon will stay on target during the trigger pull. It is very easy, particularly for new shooters, to flinch or otherwise disrupt the alignment of a gun while squeezing the trigger.

, As with all other stages of firing except actual firing, ensure that your finger is straight and off the trigger and the gun is pointed in a safe direction while you reload.


For a revolver, this will mean releasing the cylinder and removing the expended shells either by means of a clip or a pushrod built into the cylinder.
Most pistols will ""lock back"" their slides when the magazine is empty. This state is referred to as ""slide lock"". A pistol at slide lock must be readied to fire by inserting the magazine and releasing the slide, either by means of pulling back slightly upon the slide and then allowing it to go forward, or by means of the pistol's slide release lever.
Some handguns, particularly older models, may go into battery (the slide will come forward and the weapon will be ready to fire) when a magazine is inserted while the handgun is at slide lock. If your finger is on the trigger this will produce an accidental discharge! Remember rule 3 - finger off the trigger unless you are shooting.

Re-acquaint yourself with the four rules of firearm safety.,
Load your rifle.,
Assume a firing stance with your rifle.,
Use your rifle's sighting system to align the rifle with your target.,
Take a deep breath and bring your breathing under control.,
When you are ready, pull the trigger straight back to the rear.,
When the rifle's magazine is empty, use the rifle's loading system to add more ammunition if desired.",How to Fire a Gun3," Most rifles are chambered in higher-pressure, heavier-recoiling calibers than handguns, and many rifles, especially precision bolt-action and semi-automatic rifles, have very light triggers than can easily go off accidentally. This makes the consequences of a lapse in safety with a rifle extremely serious.

, For a magazine-fed bolt-action or semi-automatic rifle, this will require loading a magazine and then inserting it into the rifle. Rifles with internal magazines will have a loading procedure established in the user's manual.

, The most common and likely stance you will be using at a firing range is seated at a table for shooting called a ""shooting bench"" or simply a ""bench"". Rest your rifle on the sandbags or supports provided at the bench or its bipod, and shoulder your rifle so that your dominant eye aligns with the rifle's sighting system.


Lean forward and ensure that the muzzle of the rifle clears the edge of the bench. This will help make sure that you do not accidentally ""muzzle sweep"" or endanger other shooters nearby and prevent blast damage from your rifle's muzzle from scorching the bench.
Press your cheek firmly down into the stock of the rifle. This is known as establishing ""cheek weld"". Do not worry about the stock recoiling into your face - in fact, leaving your face off of the rifle can cause it to fly back and seriously injure your face. Pressing your face into the rifle's stock will prevent this type of injury.
Seek professional instruction if you want to advance into standing, kneeling, or moving while shooting a rifle. Be aware that outside of the context of competitive shooting or institutional training there are very few places to learn how to shoot while on the move.

, Depending on the type of sighting system your rifle uses, you will need to focus your eyes differently. Your rifle's sights may need to be zeroed in order to figure out where it will shoot.


If your rifle uses a reflex sight (often referred to as a holographic or red dot sight) focus your eyes on the target and align the sight with where you want the rifle to shoot. Focusing on the dot may actually make it more blurry. This is by design; these scopes are intended for you to ""focus through"" onto your target.
If your rifle uses a traditional rifle scope, bring your eye into the proper eye relief for your scope. Adjust your scope's parallax settings if necessary to ensure that your scope is focused at the proper range. Align the scope's crosshairs with the desired point of impact. This is usually, but not always, the center.
If your rifle uses mechanical open sights or ""iron sights"", align the front and rear sights as with the handgun and focus on the front sight.

, Even minor, involuntary movements related to breathing can create significant errors in aim. Your rifle, if properly held, will contact your body at multiple points that will sway significantly when you breathe. To minimize this source of error, shoot at the bottom of your breathing cycle (when most of the air is expelled from the lungs).

, It can be helpful to think of ""squeezing"" the trigger - the primary goal is give the rifle a smooth, controlled input that will not disturb the alignment of the rifle's sights.


Try not to anticipate the ""break"", or the point in the trigger's travel from front to rear at which the rifle will go off. Anticipating the break can cause an involuntary flinch from recoil which can contribute to inaccuracy.

, For magazine-fed rifles, this will require releasing the magazine and re-inserting another magazine if desired. If you are using a rifle with an internal magazine, insert more rounds into the magazine using the procedure established in your rifle's manual.


If you are shooting a bolt-action or pump-action rifle, you will need to manually cycle the action to eject the spent round and chamber a new round.
Most semi-automatic magazine fed rifles will ""lock back"" the bolt when the last round of a magazine or clip is fired. This will be visible as a large opening where bullet casings usually come out of; this is meant to indicate clearly to the operator that the magazine is empty. Once a new magazine or clip is inserted, the bolt must be released, usually by means of a control called the ""bolt release"", in order for a round to be chambered and the weapon readied to fire.

Re-acquaint yourself with the four rules of firearm safety.,
Load your shotgun.,
Prepare your shotgun for firing.,
Mount your shotgun.,
Line up your target using the shotgun's sighting system.,
When you are on target, release the safety and pull the trigger straight to the rear.,
When the shotgun magazine is empty, reload the shotgun by inserting more shells (or another magazine) if desired.",How to Fire a Gun4," Shotguns in particular can produce devastating consequences when discharged negligently, so pay special attention to rules 2 (watch where you point that thing!) and 3 (finger off the trigger!).

, Depending on whether your shotgun is tube-fed (utilizing a tubular magazine permanently affixed to the shotgun), magazine-fed or break-open, this procedure will vary.


On most common tube-fed shotguns like the Mossberg 500, Remington 870 or Remington 1100, shotgun ammunition or ""shells"" are loaded into a cavity at the bottom of the shotgun's receiver. Place a shell on the lifter - the metal lever sitting inside this cavity - and Insert a shell with the base of the shell towards the back of the shotgun. Push the shell down and forward firmly until it clears the lifter and loads into the magazine tube.
On a magazine-fed shotgun like a Saiga 12 or Akdal 1919, the loading procedure is identical to that of a rifle - insert shotgun shells into the magazine and then insert the magazine into the shotgun.
On a break-open shotgun design, a mechanical release will cause the shotgun to swing open, allowing access to the shotgun's chamber.

, In a pump-action or semi-automatic shotgun, this will mean working the pump or the bolt handle to load a shell into battery. For magazine fed shotguns you will need to operate a charging handle in a fashion similar to a semi-automatic magazine-fed rifle.

, Bring your shotgun up to your shoulder in a smooth motion, while being aware of rule 2 (watch what your gun is pointing at!) and look down the top of the barrel.

, Unlike rifles and handguns, shotguns often have very simple sighting systems.


For a shotguns with a bead sight, your eye will act as the rear sight for the shotgun; you will verify alignment of your barrel with your target using the top plane of the barrel. Focus your eye on the front bead and level the shotgun at the target so that the top of the barrel is either completely or partially hidden, depending upon the type of shotgun.
On a shotgun with rifle sights, ghost ring sights or similar ""iron sights"", focus your eyes on the front sight as with a rifle and place the front sight upon the desired point of impact.
For shotguns with red dot sights or scopes, follow the same procedure as for rifles with these types of sights.

, Follow the same rules for trigger safety with shotguns as you would with any other firearm - finger off the trigger unless you're shooting!


Depending on the type of shotgun you have, there may be more than one trigger, or the trigger may actuate more than one firing mechanism (for instance in over-under or side-by-side shotguns). Use the same safety precautions for these triggers as before, and remember rule 1 (the gun is always loaded!).

, As with rifles and handguns, many shotguns will lock back the bolt when the shotgun is empty, indicating that it needs to be reloaded.


A tube-fed shotgun may require that a shell be placed in the chamber, or the bolt be allowed to go forward on an empty chamber, before shells can be loaded into the magazine tube.

Swim only if a boat or solid object is in reach.,
Keep your head above the water.,
Assume the HELP position.The Heat Escape Lessening Position, called HELP, keeps your body as warm as possible and conserves energy while you wait to be rescued.,
Huddle if you can.,
Avoid panicking.,
Get medical attention.",How to Stay Warm in Cold Water1," If a boat, dock, or some other solid object you can climb upon is no more than a few yards away, swim to it and get out of the water. Otherwise, stay put. Even strong swimmers can end up drowning when they try to swim in cold water. When too much body heat gets lost, hypothermia sets in very fast., Hopefully you're wearing a life jacket or personal flotation device (PFD), because it's imperative that you stay afloat. You don't want to have to do the doggie paddle to keep your head above water, since that uses up too much energy. Make sure your life jacket or PFD is fastened tightly, and lean back a bit to make it easier to keep your head above the water's surface.


Look around for something that may be floating in the water that could help you stay afloat. If your boat capsized, you may see a lifesaver ring, seat cushions, or other items you can grab.
If you don't have anything to keep you afloat, you'll have to use your hands and feet. Try to move as little as possible, making only as many movements as necessary to keep your face out of the water.

, Draw your legs up to your chest and cross your feet. Wrap your arms around your chest and keep all your appendages close to your chest. Now ""sit"" in this position and bob on the water's surface.


HELP only works if you're wearing a PFD that keeps your head above the water without your having to move. Don't attempt HELP unless you're wearing a PFD.
If you're wearing a life jacket that's designed in such a way as to make it difficult to assume HELP, assume the ""survival position"" instead.Keeping your head above the water, hold your body vertical with your arms straight at your sides, and your legs straightened and held together.

, If you're in the water with other people, the best way to stay warm is to huddle together. Get close to each other and lock arms and legs so that you're forming a big group hug. Make as much bodily contact with each other as you can., This uses up much-needed energy for survival. Have faith things will turn out if you are in need of rescue and keep as clear-headed as possible.

, As soon as you get out of the water, dry, off, warm up, and get treated for hypothermia. If you were in the cold water for more than a minute or two, you could sustain organ damage, so it's essential that you get checked out as soon as possible.

Wear a personal flotation device (PFD).,
Wear the right clothing when you're around water.,
Keep your head warm.",How to Stay Warm in Cold Water2," If you are around frigid water, such as the Arctic or Antarctic waters, you may be required to know how to use a survival suit. If you are told to put it on, do it immediately. It will allow you to survive longer in the coldest waters on the planet.


Don't venture into icy cold waters on a boat without preparing in advance. If you don't have a survival suit to keep you safe, the risk is just too great.
Even if you're wearing a survival suit, you shouldn't stay in freezing water for too long.

, This aquatic garment seals out water completely and will keep you warm in cold water. If you know you will be around cold water such as the Pacific ocean or certain rivers where you might go whitewater kayaking), a dry suit is probably an acceptable level of protection.

, This is good choice for warm to cool waters, such as what you'd encounter while SCUBA diving or snorkeling in certain areas.


Not all wetsuits are created equal. Some cover only the torso, while others cover the arms and legs as well. Make sure you know what type of wetsuit you need for the particular water temperature you're entering.

, Whenever you are out boating or doing some other water activity (apart from diving), always wear a personal flotation device. If will help keep you floating and it adds an element of warmth.


Some PFDs have good insulation that can make the difference between surviving or not in cold water.
Consider putting reflective tape or another reflective material on your PFD in case you're caught in the water at night. This will help a search party find you more quickly.

, If you aren't actually wearing a wetsuit, wear layers of light clothing rather than heavy clothes. The layers will help to trap air but the lightness will prevent you from being weighed down.


Don't wear cotton. This fabric weighs you down when it becomes wet, and it doesn't keep you warm.
Wear a wicking layer and a waterproof layer. Wool or another fabric that wicks moisture away from your skin should be worn underneath a protective layer of waterproof clothing., You can prevent the loss of too much body heat by focusing on keeping your head warm. If you'll be in cold water, wear two swim caps. Wear ear plugs designed for underwater use, so you don't lose too much heat through your ears."

Steer clear of spiny plants.",How to Survive in the Desert," Most of your body's water loss happens through perspiration. Cover as much skin as possible with loose, light-weight clothing. This will trap the sweat against your skin, slowing evaporation and therefore water loss. For this reason, it's probably best to go with a cotton undershirt rather than a wicking fabric.Cover it all with a light windbreaker.


Wear a wide-brimmed hat, sunglasses, and gloves.
Pack wool or fleece clothing. If an emergency occurs, you may be traveling at night, when it can get quite cold.
Light-colored clothing reflects more heat, but dark clothing usually provides better protection from UV light, which causes sunburn. If possible, find white clothing that's labeled with a UPF (Ultraviolet Protection Factor) of 30+.;
, Whenever you enter a desert, bring more water than you expect. While walking in sunshine and 40ºC (104ºF) heat, the average person loses 900 mL (30 oz) of sweat every hour.In an emergency situation, you'll be thankful for any water you carried.


Divide the water you're carrying among several containers. This minimizes the amount of water you can lose to one leak.Store the excess in a cool spot in your vehicle, away from direct sunlight.

, Energy bars, pemmican, jerky, and trail mix are popular choices. Do your research, experiment beforehand, and be prepared. When wheeled vehicles break down, it's just your two legs and the path to the next town, and you don't want to be carrying anything nonessential.


Include some foods with salt and potassium, which are lost in sweat. These will help you avoid heat exhaustion and retain more water. However, if you are dehydrated, excess salt can make you feel worse.
Food is not a priority in a desert emergency. If you are out of water, only eat the minimum required to function., Here are the bare essentials for a survival kit:Sturdy emergency blankets
Cords or rope
Water purification tablets
First aid kit
Fire starters
Powerful flashlight or headlamp. LEDs last longest.
Knife
Compass
Signal mirror
Goggles and a dust mask or bandana (for dust storms)

, In a desert survival situation, you do not want to be moving around during the day. The cooler night air enables you to travel farther and faster with minimum danger of heat exhaustion. In hot climates, this single decision will save your body about three liters (three quarts) of water per day., If you don't have a shaded car to stay in, string cords between a pair of objects in a place that gets shade most of the day. Drape a sturdy emergency blanket over the cords. Place a few pieces of brush on top of the blanket, then cover it with another emergency blanket (this one can be a thin Mylar sheet). The gap of air between the two blankets insulates the shelter, keeping it cooler.


Build this in the evening or at night. If you build it during the day, you'll trap heat in.
You can use an existing rock overhang or cave instead, but approach carefully as an animal may be using it.

, Building a fire is a great way to make a signal, creating smoke during the day and light at night. While in transit, keep a signal mirror in reach to reflect light at passing aircraft or distant cars.If you plan to stay in one spot until rescue, place rocks or objects on the ground to write SOS or a similar message, readable by aircraft.

, If you have a supply of water and someone knows where you are, staying in one place may be your best chance of rescue. Traveling to find help will exhaust you much faster than staying in place, and water loss will cut your survival time way down if you can't find another supply. That said, if your water supplies are low, you will need to look for more. You cannot expect to survive more than a couple days if you run out of water.

, If there's been a rainstorm recently, you may find pockets of water in rock outcrops or flat stone surfaces. More often, you'll need to search for areas with possible groundwater:


Follow animal tracks leading downhill, birds circling around something, or even flying insects.
Walk to the greenest vegetation you can see, especially large plants with wide leaves.
Follow canyons or dry river beds upstream, and look for a depression, especially on the outside edge of a bend.
Look for a slope of hard, non-porous rock, where rainwater would run into the soil. Dig in the sand or soil at the base of this slope.
In developed areas, look for buildings or troughs. When the sun is low, its glare will reflect off distant metal objects and water collection structures.

, Once you've found one of the areas above, dig about 30 cm (1 ft) down. If you feel any moisture, enlarge the hole to about 30 cm (1 ft) in diameter. Wait for a few hours for the hole to fill with water.Purify water whenever possible. If you don't have the option, drink. Even if you do get sick, it will usually take a few days for symptoms to appear, while dehydration will get you much faster.

, Besides groundwater, you can find dew gathering on plants before dawn. You may also find water in hollow tree trunks. Gather these sources with an absorbent cloth, then squeeze it into a container.


Half-buried rocks have a cool base in the early morning. Turn them over before dawn so a little condensation forms.

, Many people make their journey much harder by underestimating their water needs. Trying to ration your supply is a mistake that can cost your life. If you notice any of the following symptoms, drink more water:Urine with a dark color or a noticeable smell.
Dry skin
Dizziness
Fainting

, If you feel lightheaded or nauseous, or if your skin feels cool and clammy, seek shade immediately. Rest and treat yourself as follows:Remove or loosen your clothing
Sip a sports drink or slightly salty water (about 5 mL salt per liter water / 1 tsp per quart).
Apply wet cloth on your skin to aid cooling evaporation.
Warning: if untreated, this can progress to heatstroke. This causes muscle cramps, red skin that no longer sweats, and eventually organ damage or death.

, Most mammals and reptiles will stay away from you, especially if they are alone. Follow the same practice and be aware of your surroundings to avoid accidentally cornering something. If possible, research the wildlife of the local region beforehand so you know how to respond to specific species.


Do not reach into small spaces or under rocks without poking it with a stick first. Scorpions, spiders, or snakes could be hiding there.
In areas with killer bees, be alert and stay away from hives.

, Although it's not hard not to touch a cactus, you may not know that some of them scatter spiky burrs on the ground to spread their seeds. Although usually not a high priority, it's a good idea to steer clear of the area.In the worst case scenario, you could cut yourself and get an infection.

The first thing you should do is stay calm and think quickly. You have only seconds to increase your chances of survival so it’s crucial to act on your toes.;
, The best way to survive a fall is to avoid hitting your head. People who land on their head almost always die, even if it was just from a few stories.While landing on your feet can sometimes cause pelvic injuries, it is a much safer bet than landing head first.


Keep your legs and feet tight pressed against each other so that both of your feet hit the ground at the same time.
If you find yourself falling out a window head first, try to quickly reposition yourself so your feet will be the first thing to hit the ground.A fall from a second story window takes only seconds so you must act quickly.

, If you are trying to escape from a window and you can avoid jumping, it is best to hold onto the windowsill or ledge, lower yourself to arms length, and drop from there. This will shorten the distance between you and the ground and therefore, reduce the impact.


Before you fall, push off a bit with your feet and hands to make sure you clear the wall.

, The severity of injuries from a fall is closely related to the speed of impact. This explains why a long fall is more dangerous than a short one. Slowing down your fall may not be possible from a two story window since it lasts only seconds, but if you find yourself falling from a higher distance, lie flat to increase your surface area and slow yourself down.If you lie flat to create resistance, make sure you position yourself to land feet first before you land.

, If you happen to have an option of what to land on, always opt for the softer option. Survivors have fallen into snow, trees, or something that absorbs your landing better than concrete. So if you’re falling on the edge of concrete and grass, try to land on the grass to minimize your impact.

, Staying calm and relaxed may be the last thing on your mind when you’re falling to the ground, but tensing your muscles up increases your chance of injury. When you remain relaxed, your muscles, joints, and ligaments move naturally and in an ideal way that helps you avoid serious damage. One way to stay relatively calm is to focus on what your next steps are for surviving and preventing injury. This will keep you from panicking about all of the things that could happen to you.

, Right before you fall, bend your knees for the impact and land on the balls of your feet. This reduces the impact on your body and can be the difference between surviving with minimal injury and permanent damage to your spine or pelvis.


After your head, your pelvis is the other body part you want to avoid injuring during a fall. The pelvis is a ringlike structure of three bones located at the base of the spine. It’s surrounded by blood vessels, nerves, and organs, so an injury there can cause substantial damage, including paralysis.Do not bend your knees too far. You only want a slight bend so your knees aren’t locked.

, You want to land softly on the balls of your feet. This will cause you to slightly lift up, resulting in less shock to your body and will add power to your spring. Your legs will sustain less injury so hopefully you don’t break any bones or severely damage your ligaments.

, You should position your body to roll forward after impact, rather than immediately bounce up or collapse. Tighten your stomach muscles to draw your knees towards your chest, tuck your chin in, and remember to keep your arms in as you prepare to roll. , Once you have tucked your body into a ball, roll at a 45 degree angle onto your shoulder instead of straight forward or sideways. Roll onto your back and if you don’t feel any pain, continue to roll back onto your knees and then your feet. Rolling forward allows most of the energy from your fall to release into the roll, and not into your legs or spine.


If, once you have rolled onto your shoulder, you think you may have broken a bone or injured your spine, do not move onto your feet or knees. Stay in a comfortable position until help arrives.
Make sure to avoid any impact on your head or neck when rolling.

,, Build a fort if necessary.

, Water is the most important. There may be bottled water on the plane. The best way to get water is to explore the island a little bit, but don't stray too far from camp and find a river, stream, lake, or other fresh body of water. If it looks foggy, nothing is alive around it, or it looks like there is oil in it, do not drink it.

Don't drink salt water, as it quickens dehydration. If you can't find water, here are other ways:
Get a plastic blanket and some big strong sticks, and put the sticks up. Then, tie the blankets to the sticks and when it rains, the rain catcher will collect water.

If you don’t know how to get started, it might be a good idea to get a quality pre-made survival kit that includes the above items.;
, Make sure everything fits in there nicely.

, Find out the average temperature, geographical features, and what animals inhabit the area. After the research, plan out what you are going to structure for a shelter, what defensive weapons you could make and how you could hunt certain animals.

, Leave a copy of the map to someone you trust, and make sure you tell them when you are planning to return. They should alert authorities if you don’t get back within the time specified.


Water: Water is one of the most important things in a survival situation. The most likely way to find water is downhill. Going downhill, will probably lead to a stream or river. Make sure you always use purification tablets, or boil your water.
Food: There are many ways to get food. Usually if you see an animal eat it, then it is probably edible. But always know there is a risk of that food the animal ate might be harmful to humans. You can also hunt for food by using trips fishing fences or spears. A spear is a valuable weapon when it comes hunting. Chop a tree down. Cut a cylinder shape of wood. Sharpen one point. Fishing fences are when you make a fence in the water. Make sure the fish won't be able to get out the side of the fence. Leave a small opening for fish. Bait. Come back a couple hours later.
Fire: There are many ways to start a fire, make sure you know and have practiced at least two different ways. Being able to start a fire and stay warm at night can mean the difference between life and death.

Locate a space with lots of natural light or strong artificial lighting. Make sure your workspace has a large flat surface and enough room from all of the necessary materials and tools for this project., To create a knife sheath, you will need to collect the following materials:


8 or 9 ounce leather
Graph paper
Cardstock or cardboard
Masking tape
Leather dye
Waxed thread
Neatsfoot oil

, To create a knife sheath, you will need to collect the following toos:


Pencil
Ruler
Scissors
Thin bladed utility knife
Compass
Awl (a sharp pointed tool used to puncture leather)Overstitch wheel (a wheel with sharp points used to mark even stitching holes)Drill and 1/16 inch bit
Wood rasp (a file used to shape and eliminate wood)Belt sander
Two needles
Spray bottle filled with water
Contact cement glue
Dauber (a stick with a cotton ball attached to one end that is used to apply dye)
220 grit sandpaper
fine sandpaper
Clean rags

, Create your custom sheath pattern for your knife on a piece of graph paper. Use a ruler to locate the center of the paper. Draw a line down the center of the page from top to bottom to divide the paper in half. This line represents the sheath’s fold., Place the knife on the prepared graph paper to the left of the centerline. Position the top of the knife blade approximately ⅛” from the centerline—the sharp side will face away from the centerline.


Use a pencil to trace the sharp side of the knife. Begin at the centerline approximately ⅛” down from the tip of the blade. Following the blade’s curve, draw a line up and around the sharp side of the knife. Continue the line ⅔ of the way up the handle. Do not trace directly along the handle. Since the handle is thicker than the blade, extra material is required in order to enclose it.Measure and draw the welt. The welt is an additional piece of leather placed inside of the sheath. It runs along the sharp side of the blade to prevent the knife from cutting through the sheath. Create a second curved line that is 9/16” to ⅝” away from the first curved line.Design a sleek top line to connect the pattern’s curved outer-line to its straight centerline. Locate and mark a point on the centerline that is approximately 1 inch above the top of the curved outer-line. Connect this point with the top of the second curved line—this connecting line should gradually rises from the lower horizontal line up towards the top horizontal line.Create the belt loop. Shift the centerline to the left ¼ inch and extend it up from the top of the handle 4 ½ inches. Connect the original centerline to the shifted centerline with a slight curve. Draw a ¾ inch straight horizontal line from the shifted centerline to the left. Connect the sheath’s second curved line with the belt loop’s top horizontal line at a 45° angle., Fold the paper along the original centerline. Unfold the paper and cut out the left side of the pattern—make sure to stop at the centerline. Refold the pattern and carefully cut along edges of the sheath pattern—the right side of the sheath pattern will not include the belt loop pattern., When creating a knife sheath, it is ideal to use 8 to 9 ounce leather.


Lay the leather on your work surface so that the soft side is facing up.
Determine if you will wear your sheath on the right or the left. If you are right handed, you may wish to wear your belt sheath on the right. Flip the pattern over so that the belt loop is on the right side of the pattern. If you are left handed, you may wish to wear your belt sheath on the left. Flip the pattern so that the belt loop is on the left side of the pattern.Place your pattern onto the leather and secure the pattern in place with masking tape.
Use a pencil to trace the pattern onto the leather—trace directly over the masking tape.
Use a sharp thin bladed utility knife to cut out the pattern., The area between the two curved lines on the original pattern represents the welt.


To create a welt pattern, cut along the inner curved line of the original pattern. Continue cutting ¼ inch beyond the centerline.
Place the welt on the leather and secure it in place with masking tape.
Trace the welt pattern onto the leather with a pencil and cut it out with the utility knife., In order for the welt to fit properly, it is necessary to slit the bottom of the sheath along the centerline. Punch a hole in the leather along the centerline 9/16” to ⅝” from the bottom. Use your utility knife to slit the leather along the centerline from the base of the circle to the bottom of the sheath., A stitch line allows you to keep your stitches straight. To create the stitch lines you will need a pencil and a ruler.


Use a ruler to draw a straight horizontal line 1 ¾ inch from the top of the belt loop—begin and end the line ¼ inch from each side. This will be the bottom stitch line.
Place your pencil on the right end of the horizontal line. Moving your pencil towards the top of the belt loop, draw a 1 ½ inch straight vertical line. Repeat on the left side.
Connect to the vertical lines with a straight horizontal line., To ensure even stitches, it is beneficial to mark the stitches before puncturing the leather.


Run a damp rag over the stitch line to wet the leather slightly.
Use an awl, a sharp pointed tool, to mark the first stitch in the lower left corner of the stitch line.Place one spoke of an overstitch wheel, a wheel with sharp points used to mark even stitching holes, in the hole you created with the awl.Rotate the overstitch wheel along the stitch line to create a series of evenly spaced dots along the stitch lines., Lay the sheath on a piece of wood—the wood prevents the drill or awl from puncturing your work surface. Individually puncture each hole with a drill bit or an awl by inserting the tool through the leather and into the wood.


When using a drill, create the holes with a 1/16 inch drill bit., The belt loop attaches directly to the soft side of the leather. You will attach the belt loop with glue and stitches. In order for glue to adhere to the leather, you must roughen up the leather at the points of attachment.


Hold the belt 2 inches from the top of the leather strap and fold the belt loop ½ inch above its base towards the soft side of the leather.
Use a pencil to trace the top 2 inches of the leather strap to indicate where the belt loop will attach to the sheath.
Roughen up the attachment site with sandpaper, a utility knife, or a wood rasp. Using your tool of choice, carefully score the top 2 inches of the belt loop and the area inside the pencil markings on the sheath., Coat the attachment sites with a fine layer of contact cement glue. Put the sheath aside and allow the glue to cure. When it feels dry to the touch, you are ready to proceed. Dampen the leather at the fold of the belt loop with a spray bottle. Fold the belt loop and align the attachment sites. Press down on the attachment site firmly., Lay the unfolded sheath on top of a piece of wood. Use a drill or an awl to individually re-puncture the belt loop’s existing stitch holes. Make sure the drill or awl goes through both layers of leather and into the wood., To attach the belt loop to the sheath, you will need waxed thread and two needles.


Cut a length of waxed thread that is 5 times longer than the stitch line. Thread one needle on each end of the thread. To prevent the thread from slipping out, pull one inch of thread through the eye and bend it.
Insert one needle (needle A) into the stitch hole in the top left corner. Pull the needle through the hole until you an even amount of thread on each side of the sheath. The other needle (needle B) will remain on the opposite side.
Insert needle A through the next stitch hole (move to right) and pull it through. Needle A is now on the same side as needle B. Insert needle B into the same hole and pull it through. Needles A and B are now on opposite sides. Pull tightly on the thread to create a tight stitch. Repeat this process, until you return to the first stitch hole.Create 1 more forward stitch. Individually insert the needles into opposite sides of the first stitch hole and pull through.
Create 2 backwards stitches. Reverse the direction of the stitches. Individually insert the needles into opposite sides of the last stitch, followed by the second to last stitch hole.
Insert the needle on the inside of the sheath (the flesh side) through the third stitch hole. Needles A and B are both on the outside of the sheath. Trim the ends close to the leather. Use a lighter to melt the threads in the the second and third to last stitch holes., Lay the sheath on a flat work space with the flesh side facing up. Align the welt along the right side of the sheath and trace the inner line with a pencil. Repeat on the left side of the sheath., Coat the area of the sheath between the edge and the pencil marks you just created with a thin, even layer of contact cement. Coat each side of the welt with a thin, even layer of contact cement as well. Set the pieces aside and allow the glue to cure. When it feels dry to the touch, you are ready to proceed., Place the top edge of the welt along the top edge of the sheath. Working from top to bottom, carefully position the welt along the edge of the sheath. When you reach the bottom, force the welt, which was intentionally cut long, through the slot., Precision is the key to folding the sheath and aligning the edges.


Dampen the leather. When leather is dry, it is difficult to mold and its risk of splitting increases. Use a spray bottle to dampen the edges of the sheath. Also, wet the sheath’s centerline. Wipe away excess water with a damp rag.
Fold the sheath along the centerline. Align the top corners of the sheath together. Clamp down on the edges with your fingers to press the corners together.
After aligning a small section of the sheath’s edges, press down firmly with your fingers to secure it in place. Repeat until you reach the bottom., Cutting the welt to the correct size will provide a straight, clean look to the fold along the centerline. Retrieve a pair of sharp scissor or a utility knife. Cut the welt so that it is flush with the sheath., The stitch line will run down the center of the welt. This will help ensure that the welt remains in place. Set your compass to ¼ inch. Begin at the top of the sheath. Place the compass along the edge of the sheath and the pencil on the leather. Slide the compass down the edge. Continue around the bottom curve until you reach the centerline., A straight, even stitch line will give your sheath a professional finish. Run a damp rag over the stitch line to wet the leather slightly. Use an awl to mark the first stitch at the top of the stitch line. Place one of spokes of the overstitch wheel into the first hole you created with the awl. Rotate the overstitch wheel along the stitch line., To make marks left behind by the over-stitching wheel more visible, widen and deepen each mark with an awl.Place the sheath on top of a piece of wood. Use a 1/16 inch drill bit to individually puncture the stitch holes. Make sure the drill or awl goes through both layers of leather and into the wood., The main seam is long and thick—the needle must travel through three layers of leather. Cut your thread extra long and have a pair of needle nose pliers on hand to pull the needles through the holes.


Cut a length of waxed thread 6 to 7 times longer than the stitch line. Thread each end of the waxed thread through separate needles.
Insert one needle (needle A) into the stitch hole at the top of the sheath. Pull the needle through the hole until you there is an even amount of thread on each side of the sheath. The other needle (needle B) will remain on the opposite side.
Insert needle A through the next stitch hole and pull it through. Needle A is now on the same side as needle B. Insert needle B into the same hole and pull it through. Needles A and B are now on opposite sides. Pull on the thread to create a tight stitch. Repeat this process, until you reach the last stitch hole.Backstitch. Reverse the direction of the stitches. Individually insert the needles into opposite sides of the last stitch, followed by the second and then third to last stitch holes. Insert one needle through the fourth stitch hole so that both needles are on the same side of the sheath.
Trim the ends close to the leather.
Use a lighter to melt the threads in the the second and third to last stitch holes., To ensure that your knife fits securely in the sheath, you must shape, or form, the leather to your knife.


Dampen the leather. In order to form the leather to the shape of your knife, it must be damp. Use a spray bottle to wet both sides of the sheath. Allow the water to soak into the leather. Continue to wet the leather until it is easy to mold. Wipe away any excess water with a damp cloth.Form the leather around your knife. Insert your knife into the damp sheath—make sure the tip of the blade reaches the bottom. Use your fingers to press the leather around the blade and handle. Pull the knife out and reinsert it 5 to 6 times to ensure that it is fitting properly. Once the leather is formed, remove the knife and hang up your sheath to dry., After cutting out the sheath from the leather, you have the option to dye the knife holder.


Prepare your workspace. Cover your work space with 2 to 3 layers of newspaper. Lay the sheath on top of the newspaper—make sure the soft side of the leather is facing up. Put on a pair of disposable rubber gloves.Apply an even coat of dye to the soft side. Pour your dye into a small disposable cup. Dip a dauber—a stick with a ball of fluff on the end—into the dye. Carefully tap off any excess dye before applying a thin, even coat of dye to the leather. Re-saturate the dauber as needed. As the dye dries, use a dry rag to polish the leather. This will remove any excess dye and residue., Flip the sheath over so that the rough flesh side is facing up. When applying the dye to the flesh side, take care to leave a 9/16” to ⅝” strip of undyed leather around the edge of the sheath. You will attach the welt to this area with glue.As the dye dries, polish the leather with a dry rag., After hand stitching the sheath together, you have the option to sand and dye the edges.


Use a spray bottle to mist the edges of the sheath with water. Wipe down the edge with a damp cloth.Shape the edges with a belt sander or wood rasp. Then use a belt sander to even out the three layers of leather with a belt sander and an 80 grit belt. Once the layers are even, use a 220 grit belt to smooth the edge.Touch up any rough spots with a piece of fine sandpaper.Dye the edge to match the sheath. Cover your work space with 2 to 3 layers of newspaper and put on a pair of disposable rubber gloves.Pour your dye into a small disposable cup. Dip a dauber into the dye. Apply a thin, even coat of dye to the leather with the dauber.Re-saturate the dauber as needed. While the dye dries, remove any excess dye and residue with a dry rag., To increase the lifetime of your sheath, polish and waterproof the leather. Shine up your leather sheath by rubbing it with a dry, clean cloth. Pour neatsfoot oil into a shallow basin. The oil seals the leather and protects it from water damage. Submerge your leather sheath into the oil and then hang it up to dry."

, Three rules: cotton kills, friends don't let friends wear cotton, and cotton is rotten. You want to have clothes that retain their warmth even after they're wet. You want clothes that can survive wear and tear. Cotton, though it's light and comfortable, is not the way to go. Pack your bags with clothing made for loggers, surveyors and commercial fisherman.

If something happens to one, you'll have something else equally as warm. Marino wool is very insulating and cannot easily get wet. Some jackets are made of Marino, so try to get your hands on one of them.
Get a shell jacket and pains for rain and snow. Most cases of hypothermia happen in temperatures over 40 °F (4 °C). , Surviving, let along living, in the wilderness is no joke. You're best off if you have some type of training before you venture into the fight of you versus Mother Nature. Contact local wilderness groups or adventure-based organizations to rack up some useful experiences to your name. The more you know what to experience, the easier it'll be.


Learn to identify poison ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac, in addition to other poisonous plants (and avoid them). What's more, there are some plants (cow parsnip) whose sap makes your skin hyper photosensitive. That is, the sun will cause your skin to painfully blister. It's best to know your terrain to the best of your ability.
And the calmer you'll be able to stay, which is of utmost importance. If you've seen a situation before, you'll know what to do and you'll be able to relax. If you're nervous and unsure, it's possible you could make a grave mistake. Getting trained is a way to avoid future mishaps.

, Living in the wilderness will mean lots of exploring and foraging. You'll need plenty of supplies for your home-bass, but you'll also need to figure out what you can pack with you on the go. Get a sturdy, legitimate camping pack that you can depend on for when you need to venture outside.


Pack your backpack before you leave to see how much it can carry. Get familiar with how you can pack it to the brim and still be able to carry it. Even packing skills come in handy in the wilderness.

, Again, this is largely determined by the gear you have and where you are. However, here are a few basic ideas that you'll likely want to be prepared for:Know how to build a signal fire
Use a mirror or similarly reflective object to flash the horizon
Send an SOS signal, if possible
Use emergency beacon devices such as ACR or SPOT

, Choose a sight close to a water source but far enough anywhere you will not be in danger of animals (who also tend to stay around water) and high tides.


It should also be on stable ground. Avoid drop-offs, areas that are too rocky, or areas too close to water. All of these are areas that are vulnerable to the elements.

, Warmth is the essence to comfort in the wild. But just knowing how to make a fire is not enough – you've got to know when and how, too. Here are a few details:


Build a fire away from your valuables and away from your food supply, should anything go wrong (animals included).
When you cook with fire, do not use a flame right away, but instead build a fire and let it sit. You should build a fire long before you eat. In the process of building a fire, you create a hot bed of coals with will create an open flame. This open flame will allow you to burn your food to a black crisp.
Look for birch bark to start a fire. Birch bark, wet or dry, is highly flammable and is great for starting fires in wet or cold locations.
Burning hemlock bows keeps away flies and mosquitoes.

, A lean to is an easy way to construct a shelter, albeit it won't last forever. For the first week or so, have a basic structure you can sleep in. Spend that time building something more permanent. The longer you plan on being out there, the better built it should be.


It is highly recommend to never sleep on bare ground, and to always make the floor of your shelter something like hemlock bows, leaves or hay; if you do not make the floor of the shelter with hemlock bows, leaves or hay, you will freeze when you sleep on the dirt.

, You can last without food for up to a month, but water is essential. Stake out a water source that you can reliably depend on. If you can, get your water in massive quantities so you don't have to keep going back day in and day out.


Also, you can collect morning dew from grasses and leaves with a clean cloth (rag) and squeeze it out into a container. It may not be the cleanest, but it will help to keep you hydrated.

, Again, this is contingent upon your location. However you need to get food, learn how to do it. Tap into all your resources: rivers full of fish, animals in the sky and on the ground, and the plants that surround you. The more skills you have, the better off you'll be when the climate changes or when certain resources run dry.


Do not eat anything unless you know that it is edible. If you can, bring a book discussing the flora and fauna of your local.
Have a good storage system, too. There may be scavengers in your area that pose a threat to your food stock.

, Drinking purified water is critical as you can get many diseases from dirty water. You never know if a freshwater system is actually clean (for instance, there could be a dead animal upstream from you), so purify all your water.


The easiest method is to boil your water. It should take about 10 minutes.
Another is to use iodine tablets (not liquid iodine from the drug store). Use the iodine tablets according to directions that are provided on the label.
A third method is to use a water filter. Pre-filter the water with a bandana or other piece of material. Then use the filter on that dirty water. The minimum size filter you need is 1 or 2 micron. This allows particles of 1 or 2 micron in size to pass through the filter. The smaller the micron size, the better the filter, and the slower the water will come out.

A gravity filter is easiest, if you can bring one with you. You pour the water in, do more chores, and an hour or two later return to find fresh water.



, Never get a single drop of dirty water in your clean container. All it takes is one drop to get a deadly illness.


To sterilize your clean container again, boil it in water for 10 minutes. Make sure all parts of the container are under water while boiling.

, This can be in the form of a hole in the ground or something less temporary, like an outhouse.


If you’ve constructed an outhouse or similar structure, know that in winter, your butt will freeze to wood. Use styrofoam over your toilet seat to avoid a rather unfortunate event from happening.

, Seriously – learning how to navigate wherever you are is incredibly important for your success. Surprisingly, even just walking in a straight line is nearly impossible (humans tend to walk in circles inadvertently). The most basic way to avoid this is to line up landmarks, which is called ""marking"" and ""backmarking"" (turning around and making sure your backmark is directly behind you).


You can use trees, the moon, and the sun to navigate, too.If you're the type that has an internal compass, this will come easy to you.

, This is dried meat and rendered fat. Make your own favorite recipe at home in large quantities for when you need to take a two week trek down to the nearest town. You'll be glad you did.


Pemmican requires no cooking (just drying) and if you have enough fat in the mix, will sustain you longer than any other ""survival food"". You can live on it for months in any situation, even at home.

, Being alone in the wilderness means that you'll be your own doctor. You'll be your own everything, really. If you were to get so much as a cut, it needs to be addressed (it could be infected). Hopefully you have basic first aid knowledge and can take care of everything from sterilization to putting on a splint.


If you break your leg (or something similarly terrible happens), have a way that you can contact for help, whether it's a radio, a phone, or some other reliable signaling mechanism. Having this ability will help take the stress off should something happen.

, Since you're going to be on your own for a while, why not start a garden? It'll be your own little farm, and it'll be a source of food you can count on that's almost effortless (apart from the beginning stages). It'll also be a morale boost, being resourceful and in control of your survival.


Be sure you can keep your garden away from wild animals. Construct a fence around your garden, use objects to scare them away, and ""mark your territory"" if need be.

, If you choose to go to a climate where winter is prevalent, you'll need to stock up for when your world freezes over. Animals will be harder to find, walking around will be harder to do, and just staying warm will be difficult to maintain. When fall comes around, make sure you're stocked up.


Keep a few months' supply of food on hand, if at all possible.
The same goes firewood. Move if inside, if at all possible.
The water will be ice in winter, so keep fresh, clean water inside, too.

, In six feet of snow or in torrential rain, your little lean-to isn't going to do much good. Spend summer and fall building something similar to a cabin to keep out the elements and wild animals. It'll feel more like a home, too.


Figure out a way to bring your outhouse to you for the winter, if at all possible. It can be closer to your shelter, though it shouldn't be inside your home (unless you want the stink).

, You're not a sailor in the 1700s, so don't let your teeth get soft and your body deteriorate. If you don't have your own source (like dried Tang powder), rose hips work. They're not the tastiest, but they work. Pine needles are awesome too. They actually have more vitamin C than citrus fruits. Just cut some up and boil them to a tea, but watch out not to use needles from yew (taxus) trees, because they are poisonous.Your diet is essential to your survival. The more balanced it is, the better. Try to get all your major food groups so you can stay strong and healthy. If you don't, you risk compromising your immune system and being susceptible to even the weakest of bacteria and viruses.

, Let's say you're running out of supplies and need to get down to the nearest general store, about a week's hike away. If you don't know how to predict the weather, you'll venture off whenever you see fit. But if you do, you may be able to predict that a storm is coming and wait it out – or do it as quickly as possible.This means detecting changes in air pressure, recognizing cloud systems, and even noticing smaller things, like how the smoke is rising from your fire (swirling smoke is not good). Animals can give you signals, too.

, Once you've abandoned the life of money, status, and 9-5 jobs, going back may seem like more of a feat than leaving. For some, it is mentally compromising. Carefully weigh your options as logically as possible if you're considering a transition.


You may want to take small steps. Moving to a farm or a rural area may be better than trying to go back to city life, at least immediately. Don't give a shock to your system if you don't have to. Baby steps will make it easier.

Teach children how to wash their hands.,
Use antibacterial products sparingly or not at all.,
Limit the use of antibiotics.,
Limit the use of cleaning rags or sponges.,
Refrain from letting your kids eat food from the floor.",How to Safely Expose Kids to Dirt and Germs2," Kids and adults of all ages are constantly putting their fingers and hands into their mouths, noses, and eyes. This spreads germs of all kinds, both good and bad. Teach your children the proper way to wash their hands. They should wash them for at least 20 seconds (have your child sing the ""Happy Birthday"" song twice to teach the proper length of time), while scrubbing under their nails and using lots of sudsy soap. Children should wash their hands:Before eating
Often when she or anyone she is in contact with is sick
After using the toilet
In crowded places like stores, malls, theaters, and parks
If they are clearly dirty

, Antibacterial products are not a necessary product if you have a child, though many people use them all the time. Antibacterial soaps are not needed, nor are they very effective. They can also expose your kids to unnecessary chemicals. If you use them, don’t use them all the time. Antibacterial soaps and hand sanitizers may inhibit the development of your child’s immune system.Alcohol-based portable sanitizers can be very useful, but the alcohol can be very drying. Use these products sparingly. The best hand wash is still soap and water.

, Antibiotics only work on bacterial infections, though many times people take prescribed antibiotics for viral infections. Talk to your doctor to see if an antibiotic is really needed, or if the infection may be viral or can be fought off without antibiotics. Use antibiotics only when there is a bacterial infection. You can also give your child’s immune system a chance to exercise and practice. If your child gets a cut or scrape, keep it clean and covered; however, you don’t have to use antibiotic cream for minor cuts.Overuse of antibiotics can lead to development of resistant bacteria, which can be tough to treat.
Instead of using antibiotics, you can use natural sources of antibacterial, antiseptic, antifungal, and antiviral remedies if an infection is minor or your doctor says it's okay. These include things like oregano, echinacea, garlic, and honey.
Make sure to follow the directions for antibiotic use exactly. Part of the reason that antibiotic resistant bacteria are an increasing problem is that the full dose of antibiotics was not given, leaving the small number of antibiotic resistant bacteria room to grow.

, Sponges and dishrags can be sources for bacteria. To help reduce the amount of bacteria you and your children are exposed to, you should change or wash your dishrags and sponges often.When you use dishrags over and over again, you are actually spreading the bacteria around more.

, Ignore the five second rule for food that falls on the floor. Five seconds is plenty of time for food to pick up loads of germs, along with whatever else in on the floor. If food falls onto the floor, throw it away.While we want to expose kids to dirt and germs, that is not the same as wanting to feed our kids dirt and germs.

Learn what the hygiene hypothesis is.,
Recognize the evidence that supports the hygiene hypothesis.,
Know the other risk factors that might influence the hygiene hypothesis.,
Know that some germs are good.",How to Safely Expose Kids to Dirt and Germs3," The hygiene hypothesis states that exposure to germs of all kinds actually teaches the immune system to respond to infectious organisms with a balanced and effective response. The thought is that by over-cleaning and over-sterilizing our environment, we are actually inhibiting an appropriate immune response and changing the gut microbiome, which is essential for teaching the immune system and maintaining health. We also are increasing the risk of disorders such as asthma, eczema, allergies, autoimmune disorders, and chronic inflammatory disorders.


Many diseases that are reaching epidemic proportions are chronic inflammatory disorders. These include diabetes, obesity, heart disease, arthritis, digestive disorders such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease, neurological disorders, lung diseases, cancer, and others., One of the earliest studies providing support for the Hygiene Hypothesis followed over 17,000 children born in 1958.The study found that the more older siblings a child had, the less the chance was that they would have hay fever. Other studies found that children in rural areas, exposed to dirt, germs, farm animals, manure, and an overall more natural environment were less likely to develop asthma, eczema and allergic disorders.A recent study showed that newborns that are exposed to dirt and germs have a lower risk of allergy and asthma., The question of whether dirt and germs lower risk of diseases is actually a very, very complicated question. A number of factors could be playing into the association between exposure to dirt and germs and the decrease in the risk for a number of different diseases. Some of these factors are changes in diet, environmental pollution, and breastfeeding practices. Another factor may be the rise in the use of antibiotics, especially in childhood and for virally caused diseases.


What does appear to be true is that the more people have become concerned with clean surfaces and sterilizing their lives, the more the population as a whole, particularly children, have been experiencing allergies, asthma, and eczema in their youth and a variety of chronic inflammatory disease in both youth and adults., Some germs are good and essential for living. One example is the populations of bacteria living in our guts. The gut microbiome is vital for overall health and not only help educate the immune system, but provide us with vitamins and other nutrients, help support digestion, and help bowel regularity. You also have good bacteria in your nose which helps fight other infectious bacteria. These are considered “good” bacteria.Other germs are obviously not good. They causes various diseases and infections.

If you are a criminal or may be viewed as one, the police may be after you.",How to Stay Safe when Leaving Your House," Staying fit helps you run faster. Staying sharp helps prevent you from falling into a trap and not panicking prevents you from harm.


Self-defence is the first thing you need to know when you're cornered. Street fighting keeps you alive if you are attacked. If you're not fit, chances are you'll run out of breath or energy before you can get somewhere safe.
Think on your feet. It could help you know what you need to know to get out of the situation. It can help you understand other routes of escape which you would not know it you were thinking of your family. If you lose sight of someone who is after you or if you don't know where they are, quietly hide from them.
Try to stay one step ahead of the enemy.;
,


Knowing your locality can help you know where you can be safest. If you live in a dangerous locality or end up in a location such as this type, don't run from the cops. They'll think you are a criminal too and panic at your every move. This will make them shoot you too.
Knowing your destination prevents it from being your final destination. Going out into the middle of nowhere is not a good idea. Like an isolated part of the beach at night or beneath a noisy train highway where no one is. Stick to populated areas where people are calm and the area is well-lit. Noisy discos make it hard to notice that you are being chased whereas classy restaurants usually have people seated and calm.
Don't travel through an alley. It's dark and gloomy, and isn't very secure. And besides, going through an isolated area is just as bad. Not knowing how to get there and getting lost in some place is a bad idea. This is when you'll love your mobile's map app but not the fact that your lost in an area you don't know is safe.

, Know some alternate forms of getting yourself out of a jam(should you encounter one). Know some street skills like lock-picking. Being able to pick a lock could mean out.

, Wearing high heels is a bad idea. You cannot run in them and you are more likely to break your leg when you try to. You also can't take them off without stopping.
Dressing up to match the people around you can help you avoid unwanted attention. Dressing provocatively gets you attention. If you want to do this, make sure you are surrounded by the right people wherever you go especially when traveling.

A torch. Light isn't found everywhere.
An ID card. It helps.
Have some cash for miscellaneous expenses encountered.
Leave out unnecessary valuable items like heirlooms.
For those asthmatics, don't forget to carry around your inhaler device.

, Don't trip. As you run look for a place to hide or something you could use to defend yourself or an escape route. It's harder to shoot at a moving target than one that is stationary.Run from anyone else who's brandishing a gun if you find an opening.


Don't run from a cop, however. They may not understand why you did so and may find you suspicious.

, Fighting techniques can help you know how to disarm or incapacitate your criminal. Know street fighting techniques. They are specifically designed for these situations.

, They won't catch you if they can't.

, Lock picking and stealth can get you away without a scratch on you., Depending on what's around you, it can save or hurt you depending on how you use it. Some objects may easily give your location away, such as noisy precariously placed items. Be careful of the garbage truck, if you decide to hide in a garbage bin.

,


If they know you better they'll call the cops themselves.
If you tell your mom she'll know the area better and can tell you if it's safe or not. If your best friend noticed that you vanished and haven't been seen since that night when so-so, she might realize enough to call the cops, and to have the emergency send the cops to the pier.
If you're new to someplace and don't have any friends around make sure your family know exactly what you plan to do there. Call them frequently until you have real friends and people who know you.

, Stopping the bleeding can keep you from becoming dizzy., Avoid certain areas, if the area has had several occurrences of problems.If you must travel into or through these areas, make sure you don't fit the profile of any of the victims.

, You have to know how the criminal looked like, how many were there, what they did. Carry a notepad and pen to write it down when you are safely away. Even if they did not succeed report it to the police. They will keep you safe if required., If you drive a 3 million dollar car into a shady neighborhood then it is doubtful it'll still be there even if you were a notorious crime boss.

, Your instinct can help you. But it will also tell you do some brash things at the wrong moment. Think through it and choose wisely. Judge your options.


Getting into such trouble can be disorienting. It's because you'll be trying to understand how this happened to you. You could also become demoralized and feel useless. But that isn't the time to be confused or upset. Do anything to save yourself.

, Criminals make mistakes-use them to your advantage. Not all of them are well-experienced so with a bit of spunk you can save yourself.

, Even if it did not succeed, it still needs to be reported to the authorities., You don't want to be robbed, right?

, Your lifestyle, the police, someone like you, a lucky victim, someone you never even knew, some or all of them is or could endanger your life. Try to quit. Get therapy. Do your full time in jail. You might be happier. Needless to say every time you step out the door...karma could kill you.

Insist the operator stays on site.,
Assign an adult to watch the bounce house.,
Supervise small children inside the bounce house.",How to Keep Kids Safe in Bounce Houses1," Bounce houses generally are operated by workers who have been trained in how to properly operate the bounce house. However, that doesn’t always mean the operator stays by the bounce house the entire time. You should insist that the operators remain by the bounce house while the kids are using it.The operator should watch what is going on with the kids inside the bounce house. They shouldn’t direct their attention outside of it or on other things, like a cell phone.;
, If you rent a bounce house, you may not have an operator on site who works for the company. An adult should monitor the bounce house to make sure kids are using it properly. The adult will also be nearby if an injury occurs.Even if an operator is provided by a company, you should assign an adult to watch the bounce house. This helps provide an extra set of eyes on the children.
Remember that bounce houses aren’t a distraction so the parents can take a break. You shouldn’t just let kids go bounce without any adult supervision.
According to most experts, the main reason for bounce house injuries is misuse due to mistakes and lack of supervision. With proper supervision and usage, bounce houses are safe for children., If you allow children younger than six to jump in the bounce house, consider assigning an adult or two to supervise the children closely. Young children can easily get hurt by falling or losing their balance inside a bounce house.Consider having an adult inside the bounce house. The adult should be seated and near the children, but not jumping with the children.
Parents with young children may want to go inside the bounce house with their kids. The parents should remain seated and on the sidelines, but be near enough to hold their child’s hand or watch them to help prevent injury."

Make sure your grill is not a fire hazard.,
Place your grill in a safe location.,
Fill in any holes in the yard.,
Protect your pool from drowning risks.,
Fix any weathering on your deck.",How to Remove Health Hazards from Your Backyard1," Everyone loves to grill in the backyard. However, grills are hazards because they are controlled fires. This means you should place your grill in a location that is a safe distance from combustible or flammable items. Place it 10 feet from anything that can catch fire.Make sure your grill is far enough away from your house. Your grill poses a fire threat to your home, so you want to set your grill away from your house.
Make certain the grill is at least 10 feet away from any plants or trees. If the grill is too close to the plants, they may catch fire.
Before you discard any coals, make certain the fire is totally out by dumping a bucket of water on the coals.;
, Make sure the grill is stable when you set it up. The grill should not be uneven or wobbly, which may occur if you place it on uneven ground or don’t remove debris beneath it. If the grill is uneven, it may tip over, which can cause a fire or cause injury to those around it.Make sure that the grill is not near the edge of a deck. If it’s too close to the edge, it could fall off and cause a fire or injury.
You should place the grill in a location where children will not be near it without adult supervision. Children should never play near a grill, and they should not run around in an area near a grill.
Watch any pets near the grill. Ensure that your dog or cat won’t accidentally hop on top of a hot grill surface and burn themselves. You should also keep rambunctious dogs away from the grill, or place it in a location where the dog won’t knock it over.

, Small holes in your yard can cause an array of problems. Small holes can cause hazards for children or pets who run around the yard. They may not see the hole and then step in the hole and fall, twist their ankle, or even break a leg. Try to fill in small and large holes with dirt.Small holes can also collect water. This provides a perfect environment for mosquitoes.
Holes filled with water may also attract vermin, which can spread disease through stagnant water. If your pet or child plays in this water, they may spread the disease in the water.

, Nothing can quite match the relief of the pool on a hot day. However, backyard pools are a common cause of drowning. Your pool should be enclosed within a fence at least 5 feet high. This helps prevent children and neighborhood pets from getting into the pool when no one is there.Don’t leave any patio furniture around the pool that can be used to climb into the pool.
Make sure that the pool area is lit at night to prevent someone from accidentally falling into the pool in the dark.

, You may have a wooden deck that you love to sit on, but it may be a potential hazard. If you have not waterproofed the wooden slats of your deck, they could begin rotting after a few years. If they start rotting, they pose potential risk for breaking or caving in, which can lead to injury. Warped wood may also pose a tripping risk.Look for any splits or cracks in the wooden slats. You should also check the edge of the deck, where it connects to the house. This is probably where you will see damage first.
You should waterproof your deck every two or three years.

Talk to your children about gun safety.,
Talk to the parents of your children's friends.,
Instruct our children to tell an adult if they find a gun.,
Encourage them to speak up about rumors.",How to Protect Kids from Gun Accidents," The best way to prevent gun accidents from occurring in your home is to not store any guns at home. People who store guns at home are more likely to be involved in gun accidents than they are to successfully use their guns for self defense. If you have previously stored guns at home, but now you have children, consider whether the benefit of having a gun still outweighs the potential dangers.;
, If you do decide to store a gun at home, it is critical that you lock it up securely in a gun cabinet or another safe location where children will not be able to access it.Do not tell your children where the gun is stored. This may make it tempting for them to attempt to access it.
If the storage area has a key, be sure to hide it extremely well so that your children are not able to find it.

, Make sure that you always store your gun unloaded. This will help prevent children from successfully firing the weapon if they do find it.You should also store ammunition in a separate location from the gun to provide added security. Make sure the ammunition is also locked up and hidden so that children will not have access to it.

, Locking devices are designed to render a gun inoperable while engaged, which can prevent a child from accidentally firing it. Make sure that your gun has an effective locking device and that it is always engaged when the gun is not in your immediate control.Some states have laws that require that handguns be sold with locking devices.

, Accidents are much more likely to happen if you are not familiar with the safe operation of your gun. If you buy one, get training so you understand how to load and unload it, how to clean it, and how to fire it.Never try to figure out how to use a gun on your own. This is how accidents happen!

, Whenever you handle your gun, you should always make sure that you do not point the muzzle at anyone and that you keep your finger off of the trigger, unless you are planning to shoot. This is the best way to handle a gun at all times, but it is even more important when children are present.Follow these safety procedures even if you believe the gun is not loaded. Many accidents have occurred with guns that people believed to be unloaded.

, If you have guns in the house, it is extremely important that your children understand how dangerous they are. Properly educating your children about guns can help prevent tragic accidents if they manage to access a gun despite your other precautions.Be frank with your children when discussing the harm that guns can cause. They need to understand that people can be seriously injured or killed by guns.
Explain to your children that accidents can happen with guns, so it is important not to touch them, even if they have no intention of hurting anyone.
If your children play with toy guns, make sure they understand that real guns are completely different and should never be considered a toy.

, Even if you have done everything you can to prevent gun accidents from occurring at your own home, your children may still be at risk when they are visiting friends. It is a good idea to talk to their friend's parents about whether they store guns at home before allowing them to visit for the first time.If there are guns in the home where your child will be visiting, ask questions about how they are stored to ensure that you are comfortable with the safety precautions the family is taking.

, It's important for your children to know what to do if they find a gun. Let them know that no matter where they are and who they are with, they should never touch a gun without adult supervision, and that they should immediately leave the area with the gun and tell an adult about it. Prepare your children to educate their friends about gun safety. If they find a gun at a friend's house, they need to be willing to stand up to their friends and let them know that it is not okay to play with the gun.

, Your children should also know what to do if they hear about another child carrying a gun or planning to carry one, especially at school. Instruct them to always tell an adult about any rumors they hear involving guns, even if they are not sure that they are true.Make sure they understand that telling an adult about a situation like this is not tattling, and it may in fact save lives.

When in any doubt, do not eat wild berries.,
Stay away from white, yellow, and green berries.,
Stay away from berries on plants with spines, bitter smells, or milky sap.,
Smash the berries to test the juice on your forearm, lips, and tongue.,
Eat 1-2 berries and wait 20 minutes if you absolutely must get something to eat.,
Always look up or carry plant identification information when going to new environments.,
Know the symptoms of berry poisoning.,
Avoid any areas sprayed with herbicide, pesticides, or other chemicals.",How to Identify Common Poisonous Berries in North America1," At the end of the day, there are very few circumstances where the minuscule amount of calories in berries are worth the risk of getting sick. Even in a survival scenario, it is not worth the risk. Diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea all strip you of vital fluids and sugars, putting you in far more danger than you would have been without the small bit of food.


Just because you see an animal eat a berry does not mean they are safe for humans.
The following advice is meant to give you guidelines, not hard rules. Never eat a berry you can't identify.;
, In most cases (some botanists guess as high as 90%), these three colors indicate poisonous berries. While a knowledgeable camper might be able to name or find some exceptions, the best rule is to avoid all white, yellow, and green unless you're sure it is safe.Red berries are roughly 50% safe to eat, so some basic testing may show you what is safe and what isn't. If they are in clusters -- usually bad. Solo berries -- usually okay.In general, blue, black, and aggregated berries (ie. raspberries, blackberries, etc.) are safe to eat. There are, however, some exceptions (Pokeberry, with its bright pink stalk and dark berries, is very toxic)., In general, the following plants are not safe for humans to eat, including the berries. You should check for:


Milky or odd-colored saps.
Berries or nuts in pods and bulbs
Bitter or soapy taste
Spines or small pointy hairs
Pink, purple, or black spurs.
Three-leaved growth pattern (like poison ivy), A good way to check berries in a pinch is to see if the juices cause any irritation. First, crush the berry on your arm, waiting five minutes or so to see if you get irritated. Then repeat the process on your lips and gums. Finally, chew a berry for 10-15 minutes, but don't swallow it. If none of this causes irritation, move on to the next step.


Only test one berry at a time. These tests are useless if you can't tell which of the two berries is causing the problem., If you're in serious doubt, it is best to move on. But if you need the berries for survival, you should eat slowly, seeing how your body reacts. Within 20 minutes you should see symptoms if you're going to get sick.


Even if you're fine after 20 minutes, keep eating slowly. Pace the berries out over a long time to prevent any toxins from gathering and give you time to adjust or note problems.
If the berry tastes terrible, then this is a good indicator that it may be poisonous., There are not a lot of hard and fast rules about berries because there is such a large variety. If you are going on a hike or an expedition, carry a book with the names, pictures, and descriptions of berries. This way you’ll know which berry you are looking at.

, You will likely experience intense digestive disturbance and nervous symptoms. In general, if the following symptoms appear within a few hours of eating the berries, see a doctor immediately:


Nausea
Vomiting
Dizziness
Diarrhea
Convulsions
Blurred vision
Cramps, Otherwise, fine berries can turn toxic in an instant if covered in chemicals. Smell the berries beforehand, and steer clear of areas near farms, homesteads, or large gardens to be safe.


If you know a berry is safe, but are worried about pesticides, you can still rinse the berries off in clean water and eat them safely.Chemical poisoning will often bring the same symptoms as poisonous berries."

Allow only children of similar size to bounce.,
Adhere to maximum occupancy rules.,
Bounce and slide properly.,
Wear proper socks.,
Jump without accessories.,
Avoid flips inside a bounce house.,
Refrain from roughhousing.,
Make children aware of the rules beforehand.,
Encourage children to bounce away from exits.,
Refrain from taking food into the bounce house.",How to Keep Kids Safe in Bounce Houses2," The children bouncing inside the bounce house should be around the same size. Don’t let toddlers and small children bounce with larger kids.


Consider having two bounce houses for events with a large number of children. For smaller parties, designate specific times for kids of different sizes to bounce.
Letting kids of different sizes bounce together may cause collisions, trampling, or even severe injuries like bone breaks.
Assign an adult, babysitter, or trusted teen to monitor the bounce house to keep kids of different sizes and ages separate.

, Most bounce houses have a maximum occupancy number. This number usually can be found listed on the outside of the bounce house. Though kids may want to be together all at once, keep the number of bouncers under the maximum occupancy to protect them.Maximum occupancy numbers help keep the bounce house empty enough so kids aren’t jumping on top of one another or too closely together, which can lead to injury.
Consider only letting in a small number of children at the same time. This allows the children more room to move around and jump, so they not only have more fun, but stay safe.The majority of injuries inside bounce houses occur due to kids either falling inside the bounce house or crashing into other children. This is why watching children is so important, as well as not overcrowding the bounce house., Bouncing and sliding properly can help reduce the risk of injury. Children should not bounce on their backs. Instead, they should remain on their feet while bouncing. When they fall, they should immediately get back up.When children slide down in a bounce house, they should slide feet first. They should never slide down face first. This can lead to neck or head injuries.

, Kids jump in bounce houses without shoes on. However, they should wear socks. The socks should have grip or tread on them to help the kids from slipping and falling.Don’t let your kid jump in socks with slick bottoms. This might cause an injury.

, Though kids may love wearing accessories at birthday parties or group events, they should remove them before getting into a bounce house. Anyone who bounces should remove any item that could get caught on the bounce house.This includes jewelry, watches, earrings, large hair barrettes, belts, and other similar accessories.

, Children should not be allowed to perform flips, tumbles, or other acrobatics inside a bounce house. When children jump and flip in the air, do cartwheels, or other similar moves, they increase the risk of hitting other children or falling.Serious neck and head injuries in bounce houses are usually caused by acrobatics. Kids can fall or bounce on their head or neck, or they may knock another child in the head with their foot as they flip through the air.

, Children should never be allowed to roughhouse or engage in horseplay in a bounce house. Jumping roughly, wrestling, shoving other children, or purposefully bouncing into someone else can cause serious injury.Young boys are especially prone to roughhousing in bounce houses. The adult or babysitter on duty should correct any rough behavior when it occurs. If the child continues to play roughly, he should be removed from the bounce house. This protects the safety of the other children.

, Before children enter a bounce house, they should be told the rules. This may be the job of the operator, the supervising adult, or the babysitter. Adults should make sure the children are listening to the rules and not being distracted by something as the rules are being outlined.Parents or guardians should make it their job to explain the rules and risks of bouncy houses to their children. Though someone at the bounce house should explain the rules before they go in, parents should not always count on others to instruct their children. Instead, parents should take responsibility and give their children rules.
Explain to children that if they do not follow the rules, they will be removed from the bouncy house and the privilege will be revoked.

, Openings and exits in a bounce house can pose dangers. Children are at risk of being jumped on and knocked down when entering a bounce house if other children are bouncing too close to the entrance. Children have been reported bouncing out of openings in bounce houses or bouncing off slides, resulting in injury.Children should use caution when bouncing near openings and edges of bounce houses. Encourage them to use the center of the bounce house instead of the edges, and to watch for kids entering or exiting the bounce house.

, Kids should leave all food, drinks, gum, and candy outside the bounce house. Food and drinks may spill inside the bounce house, which can lead to slipping and injuries.Food, candy, and gum pose choking hazards as the children bounce.

"
"
Make sure the bounce house is weighted properly.,
Avoid using bounce houses in high winds.,
Avoid setting up bounce houses in the rain.,
Discuss insurance and inspections with the company.",How to Keep Kids Safe in Bounce Houses3," Commercial-grade bounce houses are generally heavier than the ones you may buy in the store. On concrete, a commercial bounce house should be weighted with at least 100-pound weights on each corner. When the bounce house is set up on grass, it should be secured with heavy-duty metal stakes.The metal stakes used to secure the bounce house should be 30 to 40-inch steel stakes. This secures the bounce house and keeps it in the ground. Bounce houses shouldn’t be secured with short plastic stakes.For example, a commercial bounce house may weigh over 200 pounds while one purchased from a box may weight 30.

, Wind can be very dangerous to bounce houses. Multiple incidents have reported that strong winds have blown bounce houses away. When using a bounce house, you should tell your children to get out of the bounce house if the winds range from 20 to 25 miles per hour or higher.You may also consider deflating the bounce house in high wind conditions.
Before putting up the bounce house, check the wind conditions. You can do this via your local TV weather report or an online weather app.

, If it starts to rain while children are in a bounce house, they should be removed immediately. Children should not be allowed back inside the bounce house until it has stopped raining.Dry the floor of the bounce house before children are allowed back in. Jumping in wet conditions can cause more slipping and lead to injuries.
Children should not be allowed inside bounce houses when it is storming. This increases the risk of injury due to wind, rain, or lightning.

, There are no national guidelines for bounce houses. Different states approach the safety and regulation of bounce houses differently. However, some company inspect their bounce houses, or offer warranties or insurance policies. When renting a bounce house, talk to the company about the inspection of their bounce houses, the training of their operators, and any warranties or insurance policies they have.Many reputable companies may also be licensed and have certified operators.Research the company to find out the kind of reputation they have. Make sure you are renting from a reputable, safe company. Verify that the company is a real company instead of someone who is just renting out a bounce house with no experience, insurance, licensing, or even office.If you sign a contract, make sure to read all the fine print. The contract might outline warranty, insurance, or other important information.

"
"
Be prepared for injuries.,
Remove any injured child from the bounce house.,
Assess the injury.",How to Keep Kids Safe in Bounce Houses4," Though no one wants to think about their children getting hurt, adults should be prepared for any injuries that occur. Have a first aid kit nearby and determine which adults know CPR or have first aid training.


Know which adults are doctors, nurses, or medical personnel and ask them if they are willing to help in an emergency.
Discuss with other parents any emergency protocol in case of an injury.

, If a child happens to get hurt in the bounce house, the child should be removed immediately. A parent or adult should enter into the bounce house to help the child get out.Make sure you know what has been injured before removing the child. For example, if the leg has been injured, help the child walk so they do not injure the leg anymore.

, After the child has been removed, assess the injury. Determine the severity of the injury so you know whether the child needs medical attention.If the child is in severe pain, or has any kind of abnormality in the limbs, he should be taken to the emergency room.
If the injury appears to be minor, keep the child out of the bounce house. If any first aid is needed, attend to the injuries. Monitor the injury to see if it worsens. If the pain is bad the next day, take the child to the doctor.

Identify poisonous plants.,
Use outdoor chemicals properly.,
Maintain your lawn and trees.,
Remove pet waste.",How to Remove Health Hazards from Your Backyard2," Many common backyard plants are poisonous or may cause allergic reactions. These types of plants may be particularly problematic if you have small children in your home. You should research the plants in your yard you do not recognize and find out which ones are poisonous or can cause rashes. Teach your children not to eat berries or plants they find in the yard.Some common plants that are poisonous include aconite, Angel’s trumpet, almond tree seeds, apple seeds, apricot seeds, autumn crocus, azaleas, black henbane, chinese lanterns, many nightshades, delphiniums, English laurel, mistletoe, jimson weed, and many others.#*Check any plants before you plant them. Determine if they are safe or poisonous.

, You may use a variety of chemicals in your backyard. If you do, make sure that any pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers, pest sprays, or other chemicals are properly stored. Keep them in places where children and pets cannot get into them. Don’t leave them open so they may spill onto the ground, which can be harmful to pets and humans.Make sure to use all yard chemicals properly. Read all directions and instructions regarding the use of these chemicals before using them. Carefully follow them so you can keep everyone safe.

, Doing regular upkeep on your lawn and the trees around your house can help reduce hazards in your yard. Mow your grass regularly to prevent it from getting too high. High grass provides hiding places for snakes and allows vermin, such as moles and mice, free reign.


Keep an eye on any trees in your backyard. Prune regularly and remove any dead branches. You don’t want your kids playing under trees with falling, dead branches.

, Another aspect of home maintenance if you have pets is to remove pet waste from the ground. Make the rounds around your yard from time to time to dispose of any dog or cat poop lying around. Animal feces can contain infectious organisms, which can spread to humans.


If you have backyard chickens or other animals, make certain their coops or other housing is cleaned regularly.

Control the mosquito population.,
Eliminate ants around your yard.,
Keep containers free from standing water.",How to Remove Health Hazards from Your Backyard3," Mosquitos are one of the most annoying backyard pests. Mosquitos and other flying bugs can ruin a nice night out in the backyard. To help control the amount of mosquitos and other bugs, try burning citronella candles. Burning citronella candles, especially at night, can help reduce the number of flying insects around.Mint can also repel flying insects. Keep some mint plants in the garden and around the deck.
Neem oil is also effective at getting rid of mosquitos.

, Ants are another common backyard pest. Instead of using chemicals and pest killers to get rid of the ants, try natural methods to get rid of them. This poses less of a hazard for your backyard.Pour boiling water over ant hills to kill ants.
Try covering the ant hill with a bag of diatomaceous earth. This can help control ants.
Ants do not like garlic or cucumbers. Keep some garlic and cucumber slices around any known ant points of entry, such as between the cracks on the deck or at the feet of the patio table

, Mosquitos are a common backyard pest. To help prevent them from raising in your backyard, keep water from collecting in containers. This includes bird baths, empty flower pots, or any other container that may collect rain water.Change the water in bird baths at least once a week.
Move containers out of the rain or turn them upside down so they cannot collect any water when it rains.

Pass on the yellow-orange American Bittersweet.",How to Identify Common Poisonous Berries in North America2," They have five-fingered leaves, grow tall, and are popular as a wall creeper. The berries are dark and blue. They are sometimes confused with the three-fingered poison ivy., The plant is also called poke, inkberry or garget. This is a tall and bushy plant. The flowers grow in long, bright pink clusters and the berries resemble dark blueberries. They look very, very appetizing. They are not., This plant is easy to identify. Its berry is enclosed by an orange-yellow capsule. Make sure you do not eat them. Image of Bittersweets

, Many other plants in the nightshade (Solanaceae) family, such as potatoes, are not deadly. Deadly nightshade flowers are white or purple and are star shaped. They are mostly found in warm regions, such as in tropical America. They are mostly found as creepers. All parts, especially the unripened berry is poisonous. There are serious and often deadly symptoms after consumption.

, They are green creepers, commonly climbing up trees or hanging low to the ground. They have dark green, waxy leaves. They also called English ivy, Japanese ivy, etc. They are native to Europe and temperate Asia. The berries are poisonous and are white when ripe.


The berries are usually very bitter, making you unlikely to like them anyway., The foliage is more toxic than the berries. Death is usually sudden without any symptoms. The berries are fleshy in appearance and bright scarlet. They have a cup-like depression at the base. The berry itself is not dangerous, but you should still avoid yew at all cost. The seeds can cause instant death.

, This plant grows and survives on other plants. This parasitic plant has yellowish flowers, small, yellow- green leaves, and waxy, white berries. It has not been established if these berries are harmful to humans or not at all points of the life cycle, but it is best to avoid them always to be safe., The Christmas bush has pointy, waxy leaves and bright-red berry clusters. One or two might not cause issues, but 15-20 can be fatal., Found in the eastern US in fall and winter, these dark red berries (with small, brown tips at the end), usually come in small clusters. The leaves are broad and rounded. While not deadly, you won't be having fun for the next few hours., This evergreen plant has long branches that often point up. They are often so heavy in bright-red, round berries that the branches are hidden. They resemble small, upside-down tomatoes, complete with little brown ""leaves"" at the end of the berry., Resembling little lemons mixed with grapes, the yellow berries come in big bunches. They have a little yellow tail at the end of them. American Bittersweet is common in the mid-Atlantic region of the US."

Be considerate when turning up to the camping site.,
Treat the campground facilities as you'd treat your own home.,
Look after your campsite.,
Be friendly and greet other campers.,
Be considerate of tent life.,
Help children to enjoy the campground without turning it into an experience in chaos.,
Keep noise to a minimum.,
Use a flashlight when you walk, but cover it up with your hand so only a small, diluted half-circle of light can come out.,
Leave your campsite as you found it, cleaner even.",How to Follow Campground Etiquette," If you've arrived at an odd time, such as late at night, do your utmost to keep arrival noises and lights to a bare minimum. You may be joyously relieved that you've finally made it at midnight but your campground neighbors won't be so happy if your tent-raising whoops of joy wake them up. Equally, at any time you turn up, be considerate about your neighboring campsites and don't block their access or exit points while you're setting up and be sure to select a campsite that is actually free for use or booked to you.


If turning up late, keep your flashlight or car headlights focused only on your tent. Do not swing the lights around across other tents where people are sleeping.
Avoid tooting the horn, talking loudly or banging car doors if arriving late at night. These noises will wake up the entire campground as they carry far on quiet nights.
If putting up your tent or other shelter would truly disturb others, consider sleeping in the car for the night and put the structure up in the daylight the next day.;
, Many people love to camp in the same campgrounds year after year and develop a sense of community together. Even where the campers are not regulars, there is still a sense of community built up immediately from the fact that everyone is pursuing their love of camping. As part of this, the campground is a home away from home and should be treated as such. Start by knowing the campground rules and respecting them. Some commonplace concerns to be aware of include:


Avoid washing your dishes in the bathroom or shower areas. The food clogs up the drains and makes the experience of cleaning teeth, washing hair, and cleaning the body unpleasant when faced with the leftovers from last night's burned meal. Use the designated food cleaning areas at all times.
Don't dump waste water in lakes, streams, or on the ground; dispose of in the appropriate places designated in the campground.
When walking around, don't kick up dust outside campsites. This dust can end up in the tent and on food.
Keep to the speed limits posted for all vehicles used in the campground.
Keep the campground facilities clean.
Only take showers for as short a time as you need to get clean. Other people are waiting their turn! If you don't need to shower during peak shower times, consider leaving it to when it's not so busy.
Don't allow your clutter to invade anyone else's campsite space. Equally, avoid turning your own campsite into an eyesore; keep it tidy and put away garbage regularly.

, Campsites are as good as the care lavished upon them. When looking after your site, some of the things to be aware of include:


Don't dig trenches around your tents. This spoils the ground for the next campers using the site and is unsightly too.
Only use the designated fireplace. Don't create new places all over the site; this ends up narrowing the tent siting opportunities and can soon ruin a good campsite.
Don't simply cut down firewood from standing trees or pick up wood lying around for your own use without knowing if that's okay to do. Ask what the rules are about firewood and follow them. In many places you will be expected to pay for firewood. Equally, be aware of any fire bans and respect them.
If you smoke, pick up your butts and put them in the garbage. Also, be aware that campers downwind from you don't want to smell your smoking – cigarette smoking smells very different from campfire smoke.

, Again, this is part of being within the camping community and even though you may not know the other people, you all have a common goal of enjoying the camping experience.


Help people out if others camping near you need it. Help them take down or put up their tents, help them to peg down tarps that start blowing away during a windy day, help collect clothes off the line when it starts raining, etc. All these little things make the camping experience much more enjoyable. And it feels good!

, Being in a tent is a liberating experience for many campers but it can also be a cramped and claustrophobic one if fellow campers don't behave thoughtfully. There are a few things to ensure it's a much more pleasant experience for all:


Avoid parking your tent right up next to your neighbor's tent. Unless you know one another, this is just getting too close for comfort.
Avoid shining your flashlight into anyone else's tent but your own. Don't play flashlight games over someone else's tent either! Keep flashlights down to the ground when walking about. If you take the time to let your eyes acclimate, you may not even need a flashlight.
If changing clothes in your tent, keep your tent door zipped up so that others don't get an eyeful of more than they bargained for.
Be extra considerate of campers near busy facilities such as the bathrooms, toilets, or food areas. The constant foot traffic is to be expected but it should be quiet.
Allow for tent privacy at all times and avoid peering into other's tents.
Never walk in between fixed tent-cabins that are close together as a shortcut; it scares and disrupts people.
Don't walk through other people's sites; always walk around them.
If cooking food that has a particularly strong odor, be thoughtful of your downwind neighbors. If there is a central cooking place, choose that over cooking near other tents, to keep the strong odors away.

, Children love camping and it's the ideal way to build their love of the outdoor life. However, it's important to teach them how to behave in a campground so that they don't inadvertently make things harder for other campers or spoil their experience. Some things to bear in mind include:


Explain to children where the invisible boundaries of your campsite end so that they don't cross over into neighboring campsites. While some people will be understanding, others won't be, so until you know your campsite neighbors better, keep your children within boundaries.
Have children keep bikes, scooters, and toys off the roadway areas when not in use, and tell them to always be alert for vehicles and to always quickly get out of the way.
In the evenings, help children to stay quieter by playing games with them, reading stories to them, and putting them to bed early.
Send children to the playground or recreation area for noisy games.
If there are internet facilities at the campsite, make sure your children and teens aren't hogging it all the time; gently remind them that camping is about being outdoors and not staying online all the time!

, If you wanted to attend a disco and make a lot of noise, you could have stayed at the local motel-cum-dance-hall or you could just have stayed at home. People go camping for peace and tranquility and hearing loud music blaring out at night has a way of spoiling this experience. If you have a larger group, ask to be located further away from other campers so that your noise doesn't bother others as much.


Most campgrounds have quiet hours, usually from 10 PM to 6 AM.
Be aware that your tent sides are not walls. Everything you say and even whisper can be heard, the more so if you're camped next to water. And be careful with giggling, loud jokes, and laughter – these are just as annoying as any other noise when it's sleep time.
If you're having a campfire sing song, locate the campfire away from the sleeping area. That way, people who want to keep singing into all hours of the morning will be less likely to disturb those sleeping.
Close all doors, cabinets, and other items quietly, whatever the time of day or night.
Try to remain quiet one hour before and one hour after the official quiet time; some people may still be trying to sleep.
Whisper to each other during quiet hours; even normal talking can be heard a few tents down. Stay quiet for a moment at night, and observe how far away some normal conversations are.

, Put that light only in front of your feet; not into peoples' faces or tents. Believe it or not, you can probably make your way around without a blinding floodlight.

, After packing up, check that you have collected all of your things and put away all of your garbage. If you moved logs, campfire rocks, or anything else, return the items to where you originally found them. If anything is broken on your site, such as the picnic table, or there is damage such as trenches or indents from your vehicles or tents, let the campground managers know. They will be able to fix things before the next campers take your site.


If there is nowhere to dispose of your garbage, take it out with you.

Recycle whatever you can.
If you have leftover wood, leave it for the next campers. It's a good turn to do for another.
Leave a note of your most enjoyed discoveries for the next camper; you can pass on the goodwill of fun things to do in this way.

Understand the dangers that exist in abandoned mines.,
Do not enter an abandoned mine.,
Never let children play near abandoned mines.,
Do not use the mine as a trash dump.,
Assist the Forest Service or other responsible department with information.",How to Keep Safe Around Abandoned Mines," As mentioned above, many of the structures of abandoned mines are rickety and prone to falling down at any time with the risk of people standing on them going down too. Other dangers that are found in abandoned mines include old explosives, hazardous chemicals, old wire, nails, splinters etc. There are also animal dangers from such animals as snakes, spiders, mice, and bats.;
, Entrance puts any person at risk for hazards such as falls and cave-ins.

, Children can easily fall in or might be tempted to investigate a mine as part of their games.

, Although a mine might look like an inviting and easily accessible dumping ground for trash, using abandoned mines for this purpose creates major health and safety hazards. Dumping trash can cause a vessel for infestations and contact with wild animals. In the process of dumping into these mines, many slips and falls are incurred, which can lead to entrapment in the mines, serious injuries and possible death.

, Nobody knows the location of all abandoned mines. In the USA, the Forest Service continuously assesses its lands for dangers but you can assist by bringing attention to it or any similar authority in your country the location of any abandoned mine that you come across. This will enable authorities to signpost the mine and perhaps fence it off or take other safety measures.

Be prepared to rough it, to adapt what nature offers and to make the things you do have do double duty.,

Work out what you don't need at the campsite.,
Cut down on the bathroom needs.,

Be tough on the fun equipment.,

Adapt and extend yourself.,
Enjoy the experience of minimalist camping.",How to Go Camping Minimalist Style," Minimalist camping is about eschewing the increasingly wide range of homelike comforts that are being sold as camping gear. By definition, a minimalist camper is not a gear-oriented camper and is often a person who finds just walking into camping retailers an overwhelming experience, let alone lugging all that additional stuff about! The trouble with all this gear is that it clutters your experience from the beginning (what to take, what to leave, etc.), it weighs down your transport, and it compels you to have experiences that are directed by the gear rather than allowing yourself to be led by the natural wonders around you. By leaving more stuff home and taking less, and being more prepared to make do, you can have an incredible minimalist camping experience.;
, Anyone under 10 gets to share a bag together, and kudos to anyone over 10 who agrees to do the same. The less bags, the less stuff already. Within that bag, each person has to accommodate their clothes, shoes, bathroom needs (including towel), entertainment needs, and anything else not directly related to the setting up of the campsite itself. Set the challenge and tell them that there is no more room. And veto large bags!


Have a basic rule that if the packer can't carry their own bag for five minutes without wanting to put it down, they can take it with them but must lighten it.

, To survive comfortably for a few days through to a few weeks, the basics you need would include:


Accommodation: the tent, or two or more tents if a large group plus groundsheet. Only take enough tents for the amount of people – you don't need additional tents for living rooms, kitchens, and whatever else (if you do, then book cabins and avoid camping). You may want a general purpose tarp as well, for all sorts of possibilities.
Sleeping gear: per person you'll need one sleeping bag. Extra cold people can bring along either a warmer sleeping bag or an additional space blanket.
Clothing: Be prepared to wear clothing more than once (use deodorant) and to layer to accommodate changing temperatures. (Gone for long? Take a small bottle of laundry detergent that works in cold water. You could easily clean some underwear in a sink, and dry it on top of the tent.)
Cooking gear: Keep it really basic. One small camp stove (and fuel), one to two pots, one pair of tongs and some bowls, eating utensils (mess-kit), plates, sharp knife and cutting board, and a few cups for drinks as well. Foil is excellent for lots of possibilities and while one tablecloth can be handy, you can also use newspaper from occasional reads. Have a small amount of detergent (suitable for the natural environment) and a dish cloth too. If you have cans, bring along a can opener (these can also be attached to pocket knives) and a bottle opener is useful. You can forgo the camping stove and just cook with a fire (remember the matches) provided you're a competent fire maker. Also have a basic ax or similar tool for wood chopping.
Lighting: One flashlight or headlamp per person. If it's not, go to bed early, talk in the dark until you fall asleep, and get up early. You'll love it.
Basics: Insect repellent, toilet paper, rope, trash bags, small sewing kit, essential medications, first aid kit, and sunscreen, and perhaps a mosquito net if warranted where you're headed. Anything more and you're getting too fancy.

, There are many things that you don't need but that are heavily marketed at luxury camping additions. Some of these include:


Coffee makers and any other appliance that has been repackaged for camping purposes. Do you really need an espresso or are you ready for camp coffee?
Folding tables and lounge chairs. Perhaps a folding stool is useful but keep the dining room and lounge room furniture at home. Many campsites provide tables and seating, and nature provides logs, stumps, and other natural objects that your imagination can make good use of. And if you get a Thermarest® sling, you can turn your sleeping mat into a seat without much ado; even that's overkill for some, as you could also just lean the mat up against a rock for comfort and seating!
Fancy large lamps, heaters, or anything powered. If these are your thing, perhaps hiring an RV is a better choice, especially if you're trying to also bring along the satellite dish.
Anything fancy and not something your grandparents would have known when they went camping. This test will help you to leave lots of gear at home.

, All you need is your toothbrush, some toothpaste (share a tube with everyone of the same gender as it's easier in the same bathroom facilities), one bar of soap, a small bottle of shampoo (and conditioner if you really need it), and deodorant. Dental floss is great for both teeth and lots of things that need tying up, and doesn't take up much space. There are even more hard core versions of washing your hair, such as only using soap or water, or not bothering to wash it at all; the choice is yours. One face washer should do you for cleaning the eyes and face and one for the genital region for those mornings when there is no shower facility and these can be washed and dried during the daytime. Leave the hair/body/bath gels, perfumes, hairspray, mousse, bubble baths, shaving gear, depilatory items, etc. at home. You're camping, and you're going to smell like nature, campfires, and sweat very soon, so it's best to get used to it!


Remove all underarm hair and leg hair before you leave and then just forget about it. Sure it'll grow a bit but remember – you're camping and life is back-to-natural.

, There are plenty of possibilities in the camping food section and the supermarket but you can easily get carried away on the food front, with too many seasonings, too many cans, and too many gourmet packages of some camping food you've espied and thought might taste great. Stick with what you know works when camping, and that's the basics.


Make a small kit consisting of a small bottle of olive oil, salt and pepper, paprika or chili powder, small soy sauce, and one seasoning of choice as the basic cooking kit.
Buy drinks such as milk, water, juice, and beer as you need them. There is no need to be lugging along anything other than some drinking water for the car journey.
Buy fresh fruit and vegetables while camping. Use local farms as your supply source.
Avoid having too many processed foods. Some cans of beans can be helpful but not an entire range of canned foods.
Use dehydrated foods to add dried vegetables to dishes you're cooking.

Oats and wheat biscuits make good breakfast cereals.
Rice, pasta, and quick cooking grains are important basics.

Tea bags and instant coffee pouches are useful. Sure, you may love your perfectly brewed coffee but you're camping, not cafe lounging.

Catch your own fish. If you hunt, hunt your own food in legitimate places, or purchase locally slaughtered meats. Jerky is also useful to take along.

, Only take what you know you will actually use and not a whole lot of ""we might use this if we take it"". Carting the kayak, bikes, Frisbees, balls, badminton set, scooters, swimming toys, water polo set, volleyball net, card games, board games, electronic gadgets, and goodness knows what else all takes up room and worry space on your travels, as you have to consider where it will fit and whether it is in danger of getting broken, lost, or stolen. How is that going to ensure a peaceful camping trip away?


Good small fun items for the minimalist camper include a pack of cards, a set of storytelling dice, a Frisbee, and your swimsuit.

, You've had access to them all year round. Just why do you need to take them camping? The laptop risks being dropped, getting dirty and having water soaked all over it – ditto the iPad and maybe even the portable music player. As for a DVD player in the wilds? By this stage, it's not so much camping as trying to put up with the experience! Get wild and leave the electronic gear at home.


Rediscover conversations, story-telling, drawing in the sand/soil, and stargazing. None of these activities require complex gear.
A cell phone for safety is okay but turn it off. It's out of bounds for games, work emails, and internet access (unless you're looking up how to put up your tent).
A camera is probably the one exception; documenting the beauty of all you see and the happiness and tribulations of your fellow camp companions is definitely worthwhile.

, Learn new ways to do things that you haven't thought of before. This is good for your creativity and sense of resourcefulness. So, you don't have a stand for your cooking pots? Improvise and make one from rocks and logs. You haven't got a watch to tell you the time? Tell the time using your hand. No bowls for dessert? Wash the ones you used for soup first and reuse them for the same meal. There are so many things that you can improvise and be resourceful about, that this is in itself a fun and exciting part of minimalist camping.

, If you head out to camp with the mindset that you're depriving yourself of luxuries and comforts, you're unlikely to enjoy yourself. On the other hand, if you have the mindset that you have enough for surviving, plus some treats, and that the real purpose of the trip is to rediscover nature and your resourcefulness, the trip will be enjoyable and a healthy, rewarding challenge. You will learn much and discover things about yourself and your fellow camping companions that you didn't know before and that is something gear can't ever give you.

Double the rope.,



 

Set aside a loose end.,





Measure another full arms' length and put it on your shoulders, with your neck in the center.
,

Coil the rest of the rope behind your neck.,

Take the coiled rope off your shoulders.,

Wrap the folded rope just below your hand 4 or 5 times around with the two free ends of the rope set aside in the first step.,

Pull the loose ends partially through the fold with your hand, making a loop.,





Hold the coiled rope by the loose ends and swing it to your back.,





Bring the loose ends around to your back again, where they will intersect over the coiled rope, preventing it from bouncing around as you're walking.
,





Bring the free ends forward once again, this time around your waist, and tie a square knot.
",How to Butterfly Coil a Rope," Find the half point of the rope and fold the entire thing evenly in half. This is done so that once the rope is coiled, you can use the two free ends as shoulder straps. It can be time consuming, but you won't spend as much time coiling later on. You can skip doubling the rope and still follow these steps, but in the end you will have only one strap and will need to improvise when securing it to your body., Grab both ends of the rope and measure 1 1/2 - 2 arms' length (the distance between your hands when you hold them out straight sideways). Let this section hang loose so far, as it will be used later to complete the coil.,, When you are holding the rope up, one end will be the short loose end that you set aside earlier, and the other end will be the long one that needs to be coiled.






Grab the long end with the opposite hand (without letting go of the rope you're already holding).






Measure out your arm's length and put that length behind your neck, never letting go of the rope you grabbed.






Repeat this process, alternating hands because every time you coil the rope, you'll be bringing the long end to the opposite side. You'll find more and more rope accumulating in each hand, which could make this task difficult if you have small hands and a long length of thick rope.

, Fold it in half by putting your hand in the center (where your neck was) and letting the ends hang loose., Don't remove your hand from the fold because you will need it there for the next step., Pass the free ends through this loop and tighten. This cinches the rope together securely., Then bring one loose end over each shoulder as carrying straps, like a backpack is carried.,,"

Consider your vacation, journey or expedition location.,
Get the right tent.,
Make sure the tent seams are well sealed.,
Pitch the tent properly.,
It is no longer usually advisable to ""ditch"" around your tent.,
The placement of your tent is very important.,
Use a tarpaulin sheet as additional cover and/or as a doormat.,
Ensure that there is adequate ventilation.,
Keep quick-dry towels (pack towels/super absorbent towels) handy for mopping up wetness inside the tent.,
Pack the right gear.,
Have interesting things to do when you're stuck in the tent all day.,
Take down the tent with care.",How to Camp in the Rain," Is it in the Maritimes of Canada, the West Coast of New Zealand or Tasmania or somewhere that has a regular deluge? If yes, expect rain and be prepared in advance. For other camping destinations, still expect some nights and days of rain and be appropriately prepared. It's always a good idea to look into the forecast for the area in which you'll be staying before you head out.






;
, While there are many considerations that go into choosing a tent, there are a few more specific things to take into account when anticipating rain:









The tent should have a full fly sheet with sufficient overhang to prevent upwards splashing of mud from being a big problem.

, You don't want water seeping through the cracks somehow!









The entrance way must form a lip, like a bathtub, and not be as flat as the rest of the floor (this is actually known as a ""bathtub floor""). If the floor slopes down or is simply sewn flat into the tent wall, this will let water in.
The coating of the tent must be waterproof – read the labels carefully for the product's virtues and drawbacks.
If you are camping for a short time, a small tent might be okay if you can stand being in close proximity with your camping buddies. If you're staying for 3 or more days, take the big tent for your own sanity!

, If you have to pitch the tent in the rain, put up a tarpaulin over you first to stop the inner part of your tent from turning into a bath before you even start. Put down a groundsheet matching the tent to provide additional protection. The groundsheet should not be visible under the tent, fold under the sides of the groundsheet so water running down the tent will not catch on the groundsheet and be directed between the groundsheet and tent floor. Multi-pitch tents such as Macpac, Montbell and Hilleberg brands can be put up with the fly and inner already attached so the inner won't get wet from the rain. If it is stormy you can try staking out the waterproof fly first and working under it as a crude shelter until the inner tent is setup.








, The newer bathtub floors don't leak even in a pool of water. It does damage to the camp site and leaves a mess for everyone if you ditch around your tent. However if your campsite is gravel or sand you may want to ditch around the tent. If you don't have a choice as to where to camp ditching around the tent may be necessary. As bathtub floors eventually leak you will want to carry a ground sheet to place inside the tent to keep dry.








, Look for slopes, angles, indentations, soft earth and avoid pitching in these if you possibly can. Look for the highest part of the ground on your camp-site. Be wary of selecting as your site an absolutely flat area of dried sediment which has formed as it becomes a puddle in rain! Avoid any places with signs of old flooding (washouts, debris, narrowly enclosed areas, etc). Water can be channeled to these areas and flood them in minutes during a storm.








, If possible, tie a tarpaulin to trees, poles, anything high around your camp (even onto your car), to create a ""roof"" over your tent. Make sure the sides are running over the edges of the tent and allow the water to run away from the tent. This will help prevent rain from directly pounding on your tent. This solution is usually easiest for car camping. The tarpaulin can also be placed on the ground at the entrance. Here you stand, deposit wet boots, shoes, sandals and jackets before dragging all that into the tent. (You will want to bring plastic bags so that you don't get the muck from your shoes in the tent.) Use sticks or other spare waterproof camp items that fit in the entrance as something to hang jackets over to dry. As an aside, your jackets should be hydrophobic, quick-drying to ease drying time – invest in one or two good outer layers for the sake of keeping warm.








, Living in your tent causes moisture from your breath to condense into water droplets, which may then fall down onto you and your possessions. Adequate ventilation is the key to minimizing condensation. Remember, the more ventilation, the less condensation. It helps if your tent has peak vents that you can open.








, If the dreaded water flow appears in your tent despite everything else, mop it up with these towels, wring them outside and hang up to dry again. The sooner you mop up, the drier you'll stay. It is also a hint to get out of your cosy bag and investigate the cause of the dripping – perhaps the fly or guy ropes need tightening or more airflow is required.








,









Keep a spare change of clothes in a waterproof bag, just in case everything in the tent gets wet by some terrible misfortune.
Keep a pair of flip-flops or easy slip-ons at the front door. If you're back country, choose the shoes that seem most likely to be easy to slip on and off and share this pair between you. Rubber boots can be good for just walking around camp, but bring hiking boots for hikes.
Raincoats should always be placed in your tent at night. It may be a delightful evening under clear skies but if that storm ambles on in overnight and you left the raincoat under a tree, in a locker or in the car, you'll be cursing. For those car camping, always toss in some spare umbrellas.
Have hand warmers and lightweight gloves handy. Even in summer, lightweight, water phobic gloves can prevent your hands from freezing when pitching and un-pitching your tent during the rain.

, Bring along books, games, drawing materials, diaries – anything that you can manage in your pack or car that interests you. Games that are useful to have on hand include a pack of cards (many, many ideas!). These are small and compact. It is also useful to write down ideas for word games, games that can be made from sticks and stones (e.g. Tic Tac Toe) etc in a small notebook (or memorize them if you're good at that), so that you will have plenty of entertainment. Also a sleeping pad that converts into a camp chair can make a huge difference in comfort when stuck in a tent for hours. Being able to sit upright when reading is far more comfortable.








, If you can take down the tent under the fly, then do so and put it away before taking it out into the rain. If you are camping again in a dry area, pitch the tent at the first possible opportunity to give it plenty of time to dry in the sun and breezes – this will make your night more comfortable. And if you have the luxury of calling it quits and going to a hotel or going home, pitch the tent at the first possible opportunity to dry it out. Even if that means the hotel car park. Never store a tent when it is wet, it can develop mildew.

Let the crew help you bring in your catch.",How to Deep Sea Fish," Most charters will be equipped with everything you need from licenses, rods and bait, to life jackets, meaning that you'll just need to show up ready to fish and with the necessary payment. When booking your tour, ask if there is anything required or recommended that you bring.


If you've never deep sea fished before, you need to charter a boat and go out with an experienced fishing guide. Even if you've deep sea fished many times, it's much easier to fish with a guide than to try to go it alone. Let a local show you where the fish are and have fun catching them yourself.
If you have a boat already, you need to make sure you provide all the necessary safety equipment and licensed necessary to fish. Deep-sea fishing rods and reels are generally larger and stronger than fresh water equipment, and can be rented at many seaside fishing outfitters, or from other fishermen. You'll also need a few spools of high-tensile line for fishing.;
, You will most likely get wet on the boat, so it's not a good idea to wear leather loafers and your most expensive pair of slacks. Wear clothes that can get wet or a bathing suit, and bring a clean towel to help dry yourself off. Sunglasses are also usually very valuable, since the light glinting off the water can be serious.


If you're going to be out until the sun goes down, or you're going out in cloudy weather, it's also a good idea to bring some layers. It can get chilly out at sea, depending on the season, so an old hooded sweatshirt can be an invaluable clothes item, as well as some sweatpants if necessary.
Leave cellphones, jewelry, or anything that you'd hate to lose or get wet back on shore. In the event that you get soaked, you don't want to have to lose anything valuable., Most boats will be at sea for several hours. Even on cloudy days the sun reflects off the ocean, making sunburns a serious possibility. Apply and reapply high-SPF waterproof sunscreen to help protect yourself from sun damage.

, The ocean can make the boat very rocky. If you begin to feel sick, stay on the deck, where there is fresh air and less rocking. If you are prone to motion sickness, take medicine before boarding.


If you already know you're prone to motion sickness, take half a Dramamine the night before and another one an hour before or so before you get on the boat. Keep your eyes on the horizon while you're out, because it's stationary and it will help you from getting motion sickness.

, Be sure to drink plenty of water, because the rays of the sun reflect off the water which can make the day even hotter making you lose liquids faster. Any motion sickness effects will be emphasized when you're dehydrated, and you'll feel a lot better if you drink plenty of water.


It's common to drink alcohol on certain fishing trips, but make sure you supplement any alcohol you're drinking with plenty of water. In bright sun, you can get dehydrated quickly and could wake up to a serious hangover the next day if you're not careful. Not to mention that alcohol will lower your hand-eye-coordination, making you a less safe fisherman. Moderate your drinking and have plenty of water.

, It's important to make fishing trips worth the while of the captain and the crew. It's expensive to run a fishing charter, which means you need to get a big enough group together to make the trip financially advantageous for the captain. They'll be more willing to work with someone who says, ""There are 7 of us who'll pay to fish"" than someone who's fishing solo.


Alternatively, if you want to go it alone, you need to be wiling to share a charter with strangers, in most cases. Even if you've got a party, it's likely that there will be other fishers on your boat. Expect to mingle.

, Deep-sea fishing charters are available in most vacation areas where deep-sea fishing is plentiful, and in most fishing-focused towns near the ocean. If you're on vacation, ask your concierges, look for pamphlets or research online to find a deep-sea fishing charter in the area.


It's also possible to walk around by the piers and look for booths that will take walk-ups. While this is more common for tours and sight-seeing boat trips, it's a good way of looking around for a good charter. Talk to people and you might be able to find a better deal.

, Chartered boats may fill up fast, so it's smart to book as soon as possible to ensure you have a spot. Depending on the area, you may need to book several days or several weeks ahead, so if you want to make sure that you get a spot on a boat, get in touch ahead of time.


When you charter your boat, it's important that you find out everything you'll need to know ahead of time. What do you need to bring? Where do you need to meet up? What time? How does payment work? Make sure that you get all the details out of the way up front.

, Always remember when you set foot on a boat that the captain is in charge. Just because you're paying to be out there doesn't mean that you're the boss. On a chartered boat, the crew should be knowledgeable, experienced in helping people, and expert fishermen. Ask for their help in what bait, rod and technique to use, and listen closely to all the instructions you're given.


The crew should also take care of all safety and legal regulations, on most good fishing charters. All of your questions about what fish you'll be catching, what size the fish need to be, and other considerations should be taken care of on a charter.

, Before going out to sea, contact the local wildlife commission for a listing of laws and regulations in your area. Commonly there will be regulations regarding where you can fish and when, required licenses and what kind and how much fish can be kept. Penalties may be enforced for any laws or regulations not followed.


In the United States, specific regulations, including species, season, and area restrictions can be found here.

, Deep-sea fishing can pose many dangers, and safety should be the first concern any time you're out on the water, whether you're an experienced fisherman or a novice. Always listen to the captain in charge and follow instructions closely. You need to have life jackets and other required safety equipment. Check the safety requirements with the local coast guard. The exact safety equipment and amount will depend on your area and boat size. In general, life jackets, flashlights, boat lights and paddles are required.


Watch the weather patterns. If storms are in the area, it may not be safe to go out. Ensure you will be able to navigate the waters and keep your radio on at all times to listen to Coast Guard warnings. You also need to be projecting a positioning signal at all times, should your boat capsize.Practice caution when handling fish. While deep-sea fishing, you may catch large, strong fish that will generally fight a lot as you reel them in. Be sure to steady yourself so you do not fall out of the boat. Always follow directions during the capture process.

, In general, captains should have a good sense of where fish will be easy to find at the time of year and in the location you're fishing. Let the captain take the lead and direct you to a prime fishing spot.


Generally, drop-offs, trenches, and reefs are usually good places to fish, depending on the region. Reefs in particular are usually swimming with all variety of aquatic life, meaning that large game fish will be nearby.
Tuna generally can be found near schools of dolphins, or floating under debris of any kind.

, You probably won't be using nightcrawlers like when you're back at the pond. While your bait will usually depend on the variety of fish you plan to catch, live and artificial bait are commonly used in fishing for big deep sea fish. Squid, shrimp, minnows and mackerels are commonly used bait in deep sea fishing, sometimes live and sometimes as ""chum,"" oily cut-up bait used to attract predators. Like sharks!

, Your method will depend on the area you're fishing and the type of the fish you hope to catch, and the captain should help to guide you in the proper technique for the day. The methods can be varied and used together, as well, to give yourself the best chance of making a big catch for the day. Listen to instructions and prepare to do any of the following types of fishing.


Trolling is used to drag your line deep, along the ocean floor. This is good for shallower waters to attract grouper and smaller fish, using a weighted line to skim low along the bottom.
Chumming is used to attract larger fish. When chumming, you'll usually leave baited lines in the water, then throw chunks of bait into the area to attract numerous fish and attempt to create a frenzy.
Cast a line up current. When signs suggest there will be large fish in an area cast a line slightly up current, let it come back to the area and let the fish take the bait. Reel in and recast as necessary.
Keep your lines as straight as possible, as the boat turns. Try your hardest not to cross lines with anyone. If they get crossed and someone gets a fish on the hook, you both will start reeling your lines and cause a tangle, which will be very difficult to get loose without losing the fish.

, It's a good idea to always keep fresh bait on your line, when you're deep sea fishing. If you're not getting a bite, mix it up and try something new. Listen to the captain and crew for advice, and have some patience, but also try to nix bait that's not working.


Don't be afraid to use your instincts, especially if you're an experienced fisherman. If you really want to try fishing with shrimp, say so and go for it. It's your fishing trip. Listen to advice, but also do what you want at the end of the day.

, Some deep sea fishing trips are super productive and some involve a lot of shanty singing and an empty haul. It'll still be fun, but try to temper your enthusiasm for making a big catch with a healthy dose of reality. You might be in the right place with the right gar on a beautiful day and not catch anything. Don't get frustrated and try to enjoy the experience for what it is.

, Large game fish can be difficult to reel in, so it's important to listen to specific instructions and do as you're told. Assistants may help to set the lure and let you do the hard muscle work, or they may have other ways of working. Just listen closely and stay out of the way, if you can't help.


When keeping fish, make sure you are within your legal rights. Also be aware of conservation and not keeping any endangered fish. Put any fish you keep on ice to preserve freshness.

Start with a compound bow.This type of bow is much easier to use than the traditional longbow and recurve bow, which makes it perfect for a beginner.,
Choose the proper orientation.Bows come in right-handed and left-handed versions.,
Select the right draw weight and draw length.Draw weight, which is the weight of resistance when you pull back the bow string, must be considered.,
Pick the appropriate arrows.There are two arrow types used with compound bows – aluminum and carbon.,
Practice.Set up a target in your backyard (or in some other open area) to work on your aim.,
Scout early.Most people do their hunting on leases, since these large areas are set aside for lawful hunting.,
Place a tree stand in your chosen location.,
Arrive at your deer stand before dawn.On a hunting day, you need to get settled in your stand or blind before daylight.,
Be quiet and still.,
Follow the blood trail and secure your kill.If you don’t kill the animal immediately, you will have to track your prey by following its blood trail.,
Be prepared for field dressing.,
Clean and dress your kill in the field.Field dressing involves removing the animal's internal organs.,
Use rope to secure the deer for transporting.,
Transport the deer to your home or camp.Once there, hang the deer up so that it isn’t touching the ground.,
Clean and maintain your bow.",How to Bow Hunt," You’ll gain skill with it much faster and, with a little practice, be shooting this bow quite well in a couple of weeks. Compound bows are more accurate than traditional bows, and also have better distance and velocity.As a beginner, buy a used bow.Check out the used selection at your local sporting goods shop. Look on eBay, as well.
You should be able to find a decent used bow for about $50 to $150.
Make sure you buy a bow that is legal to use for hunting, per your local regulations and permit limitations.;
, Use your dominant eye to determine what orientation you need, not your dominant hand. When holding a bow, which is more comfortable – using your left eye for aiming (closing the right eye) or vice versa? If it’s your left, get left-handed bow. If it’s your right, get a right-handed bow.


Some people shoot with both eyes open. In this case, you could use either orientation.
However, you probably still favor one eye over the other when aiming or squinting to see something far away. The one you tend to favor is your dominant eye.

, The higher the weight, the harder it is to pull back.Forty-five pounds is the minimum weight it takes to kill a deer. Anything lower will only wound them. Fifty to seventy pounds is the recommended weight for deer hunting. Draw length is another factor. The right draw length is when the bow brings the string about even with your mouth when it’s fully drawn.


Many bows will be adjustable to accommodate an arm length of 28 to 30 inches, which is the average for an adult.
If you buy your bow brand new, the seller will most likely set the bow up for you, customized to what you need.
Keep in mind that having your bow set up will cost a few hundred dollars on top of the bow price.

, The carbon variety tends to be more durable and lighter, which means it will travel faster. However, an aluminum arrow works better if you are using broad heads. A broad head is a point you can attach to the tip of your arrow. It has several very sharp blades affixed to it, which will enter your prey without causing a lot of tissue damage or bruising.


There are several other factors to consider when choosing arrows. If you’re a beginner, you might have some trouble figuring out what’s best.
Seek advice from an expert at an archery shop about the best arrow for you.

, Sporting goods stores often sell targets that are shaped like the game you’re hunting, which can be helpful. You should spend at least a couple of weeks practicing your aim before hunting in the field. Consistency in form is one of the most important factors in archery. When you hit your stride and start hitting your targets more often than not, try to shoot with the same form every time.


You will need to practice shooting your bow while sitting, as well, since in most cases you will be sitting up in a tree stand while hunting.If you plan to use broad heads on your arrows, you need to practice with them once you get the hang of shooting.
The broad heads add weight to the arrows, which means you’ll need to adjust your form to get the same trajectory as before., After you choose your hunting location, begin scouting the area months before opening day and do it frequently. You are looking for areas that are high-traffic for your chosen prey, which is usually deer, so you should be out scouting frequently.


Look for evidence that deer frequent the area. When you find a good location, set up your tree stand or deer blind in this area.
Signs to look for while scouting are droppings, tracks, deer trails, and antler rubs and scrapes., Once you’ve settled on an area that deer are frequenting, you’ll want to set up your tree stand within good range. Twenty yards or closer is recommended. Choose an appropriate tree for the stand, which is at least eight inches in diameter and fifteen feet high.If there’s not a good tree for a stand, you can set up a ground blind. You’ll want to do this at least a month before hunting season opens, so that the deer will get used to it being there.


The best time to set up a tree stand or blind is between noon and 3pm. This window is when deer are least likely to be around.
Trim some of the trees around the area to clear a few shooting lanes for yourself. Make sure you clear shooting lanes for any possible direction a deer might approach.

, Hunt from dawn until about 11am. Deer are least active between 11am and 3pm, so take a break in the middle of the day. Be settled back into your stand before 4pm and hunt until it gets dark.

, Hunting involves a lot of waiting. While in your stand, you need to be very still and quiet, since deer can hear very well. The goal is to spot them before they spot you. When a deer approaches, you need to be absolutely silent. You will have about two or three seconds to shoot before it becomes aware of your presence and hears the shot.


You will have one chance to get the deer. If you don't hit the animal, the sound of your shot will cause the deer to flee.
Before you shoot, aim just behind the deer’s front leg. If you hit the mark, your arrow will penetrate the lungs of the deer, killing it instantly.

, Wait at least 30 minutes before you start looking. In most cases, a wounded deer will lie down within a couple hundred yards of where it was shot.


If you follow it too soon, the fallen deer might get spooked and still have the energy to take off again.
The chances of finding your game decrease substantially if this happens.

, Dressing game is a messy task, so you need to be prepared. Buy a dressing kit and bring it with you on the hunt. You’ll also need plastic gloves that go up to your shoulders, a very sharp knife, rope and a large light or lantern (in case you have to dress your game after dark).

, It needs to be done as quickly as possible to prevent bacteria growth on the meat, which is why it’s crucial to do it in the field. The faster you do it, the better the meat quality will be. It will also make the animal lighter and easier to transport.


Avoid jerking the arrow out of the deer before you begin. This can create a mess.
As you clean and dress the animal, you will be cutting deeply into it. Remove the arrow when it becomes easily accessible.

, Put the deer’s head between its front legs and then tie the front legs together. Make a loop with the rope and then tie the free end to the deer’s front legs. This will make it easier for you to pull it to your vehicle or camp.

, Most hunters recommend that you hang it from its head. This will allow the blood to drain out. Rinse out the body cavity of the deer well with a water hose. Skin it, rinse it again, process the venison, and place it in a freezer that is as close to 40° F (4° C) to prevent spoilage., After a hunt, look your bow over for any damage. Wipe it down with a soft microfiber cloth to remove any dirt or grime. During peak hunting season, coat your bow's string and synthetic cables with soft bowstring wax once per week. Regularly coat your axles with a high quality lubricant.When not in use, keep your bow put away safely in its case.
Keep your bow away from any heat sources, which can damage it.

Remove the head, unless it is to be used for taxidermy purposes.,
Wash the outside of the snake thoroughly.,
Make an incision down the centerline of the belly, through the skin only, all the way from the stump where the head was attached to the base of the rattle.,
Pull the skin from the flesh by hand, again beginning at the head end, using even tension on the skin to avoid tearing.,
Remove the viscera (innards) by hand, starting at the head end, using a scooping motion with the hand if the organs are difficult to remove.,
Rinse the now eviscerated and skinned snake in cool water to remove any excess blood or other undesirable substances.,
Cut the snake into segments that are the most convenient length for the desired method of cooking.

",How to Skin a Snake," Most taxidermy projects require a different, more difficult method of skinning, but that method is not the focus of this article. It is always best to work with a decapitated snake because even ""dead"" snakes have been known to strike, and the fangs are still quite dangerous. By removing the head, you are removing all venom.;
, Soapy water or even plain water will work well. Just make sure the soap is completely rinsed off of the snake.

, On most snakes, there is a smaller belly scale covering the cloaca. In the picture, this is the last cream-colored scale before the darker tail scales. Simply split this up the middle just like the rest of the scales.

, Be sure to separate the skin from the membrane underneath right at the head end. You want clean skin with nothing attached to it. The hide should be loose enough that it easily detaches from the carcass. If the skin is a bit ""tight"", a knife may be used to carefully free it in the tough places. Peeling without the use of a knife can usually be accomplished all the way to the cloaca.


When the cloaca is reached, it is usually necessary to free it from the skin by cutting around the opening with the knife. Continue skinning to the base of the rattle. The attachments to the muscles that control the rattle generally make the hide harder to pull off. A knife must be used in this area if the skin is too tight to peel off, as the skin is rather delicate in this section.






After the skin is completely freed from all but the rattle itself, cut through the tail as close to the base of the rattle as possible. If the skin is to be saved with the rattle attached, it helps for the piece of flesh attached to the rattle to be small.






Don't fret too much about totally removing the flesh below the cloaca and above the rattles (basically the black and white banding on rattlesnakes). It is almost impossible to completely remove the skin from the flesh in this area. It will dry up easily.






Constrictor snakes such as bull and rat snakes cannot be ""peeled"". Their skin is attached with many muscle attachments over the full length of the body. Cutting through them is tedious as it is hard to get the skin free from the flesh and very easy to cut or tear the skin.

, Care must be taken near the lower digestive region or the snake might excrete unappetizing substances on the meat.

, Membrane and fat are often rather difficult to remove from the ribcage and backbone and can be cut free at this time.

Press the trigger until the pistol fires.",How to Aim a Pistol," Aiming with both eyes is next to impossible, so you need to take aim with your dominant eye. Your dominant eye presents a more accurate picture of your surroundings than your non-dominant eye.


Your dominant eye is usually lines up with your dominant hand, but this is not always the case.
To determine which eye is your dominant one, form a 1-inch (2.5-cm) circle with your thumb and index finger. Hold the circle at arm's length and look through it to a distant object.
Gradually bring the circle toward your face with both eyes open, but do not look at it. You hand will naturally move toward your dominant eye.;
, A pistol has a rear sight and a front sight. When aiming the gun, the post of the front sight should be evenly centered in between the two posts of the rear sight.


The front sight consists of a single post and the back sight consists of two posts.
There needs to be an equal amount of space to the left and the right of the front sight.
The top of the front sight should also be flush or even with the tops of the back sight posts.

, As you aim the pistol, you will need to look at the rear sight, front sight, and the target. It is physically impossible for your eyes to focus on all three objects at once, though. In order to aim the gun properly, you need to make sure that your eyes are focused on the gun sights and not the target.


The target should look a little blurry. You should still be able to see it, but it should fall to the background and look much less crisp than the gun sights appear.
More specifically, you should be focusing on your front sight. The front sight lets you know what your gun's relative position to the target is.

, There are three acceptable points of aim. No single option is officially better than the others, so you'll need to test them each out to determine which works best for you.For the center hold or center of mass aim, place the top of the front sight at the center of the target. The top should run through the horizontal center of the target.
For the 6 o'clock aim, place the top of the front sight just below the bullseye area. If using an actual shooting target, the top of the front sight will overlap the bottom of the black bullseye.
For the sub-6 aim, you will need to place the top of the front sight even further below the bullseye area. When using actual shooting targets, the top of the sight will be roughly in the middle of the white portion below the black bullseye area.

, Aiming a pistol requires patience and concentration. Sloppy aim will result in a sloppy shot.


Before firing the pistol, make sure your shots are correctly aligned.
Be patient when pressing the trigger. If you feel anxious about firing the gun and concentrate on applying more pressure to the trigger, even for a moment, you will lose concentration on your aim and will probably have a poor shot.

, An angular shift error occurs when the sights are not properly aligned. You can usually determine if you are making a consistent angular error based on the placement of your bullet in the target.If the bullet hits below the center of the target, the top of the front sight may have shifted below the tops of the back sight posts.
If the bullet hits above the center of the target, the top of the front sight may have shifted above the tops of the back sight posts.
If the bullet hits right of center, the front sight might be closer to the right side of the back sight.
If the bullet hits left of center, the front sight might be closer to the left side of the back sight.

, Parallel shift errors occur when your sights are properly aligned, but your hand moves as you fire. Holding the pistol still results in the most accurate shot, but typically, parallel shift errors do not disrupt your aim as much as angular shift errors do.


Parallel shift errors almost always result from your wrist either breaking up or breaking down, so the placement of your shot will usually be either just above center or just below it, respectively.

, Shift errors are not the only problems you might encounter. The placement of your bullet in the target could also indicate a handful of other problems.If the bullet hits out of center and closer to your dominant side, you could be squeezing your thumb or using too much trigger finger. Similarly, if it falls to the other side of the center, you might be using too little trigger finger.
It it falls to the lower right for right-handed shooters, or vice versa for left-handed shooters, you could be tightening your grip while pulling the trigger. If it falls to the lower left, you could be tightening your fingers or jerking the trigger.
If the bullet lands to the upper right for right-handed shooters, or vice versa for left-handed shooters, you might be anticipating recoil in your shot. If it goes to the upper left, you might be anticipating recoil or lacking follow through.

, Your dominant hand should be placed high along the back strap—the back of your pistol's grip—with your thumb to the inside of the barrel.Your middle, ring, and pinky fingers should wrap around the outside and front of the grip.
Your index finger should rest against the outside of the trigger guard.
This position give you the maximum amount of leverage against the gun. When you fire the pistol, it will recoil, and good leverage is an important part of keeping your hand steady.

, Your non-dominant hand is your support hand, and the way you position this hand will add further support and leverage against the recoil of your firing pistol.


Place the support hand as high as possible around the grip.
All four fingers should be under the trigger guard, and the index finger should press the bottom outside of the guard firmly.
The thumb should point forward and meet with your other thumb on the opposite side of the gun.

, Stand with your feet planted firmly on the ground and pointed in the direction of your target. Your feet should be shoulder width apart, and your knees should be slightly bent.


This stance makes it easy to move yet provides you with stability.
Grab your pistol and raise it up until it is positioned in front of you. Your arms should be straight out and slightly bent at the elbows, and the gun should be nowhere near your face.

, Follow the instructions provided in this article to aim the pistol at your target properly.

, Instead of ""pulling"" the trigger, you need to press or squeeze the trigger in a controlled fashion.


Press the trigger straight to the rear using a constant pressure. Only use pressure on the front of the trigger and not on the sides.
Squeeze the trigger until you start feeling resistance to take the slack out of it.
Continue pressing the trigger in this manner until the pistol shoots. Try not to anticipate when this will happen, since doing so often leads to a last-minute error in aim.

Mark the unit boundaries on a topographical map.",How to Bear Hunt1," Cross reference the preferred areas with the local division of wildlife maps to determine the possible hunt units. Each state outlines individual hunt units on a custom map.;
, Determine the bear populations and hunter success rates in the units you're interested in. Finalize the unit you will hunt based on the records.

, Specify the chosen unit and weapon choice on the application. The unit and weapon determines the legal hunting dates for the bear hunt.


Bears hunting weapons include muzzle-loaders, rifles and bow and arrows. Rifles are the most common choice because a high velocity bullet to the bear's vital organs kills quicker than arrows and black powder balls.

Things to bear in mind include depth, animals that lurk in the swamp, plant life (roots can entangle you or trip you), and other such potential problems. Some typical swamps and marshes include:Mangrove swamp or marsh: These will be found in tropical coastal areas. It is a swamp that usually has soft mud, found around river mouths, deltas, inlets, and along shallow bays of small islands. The mangroves grow very closely together and there is usually still water surrounding them. Their roots are extremely slippery, steep, and arching, and many of the mangroves create impenetrable masses of roots. Generally you will find these difficult places to walk in and the risk of slipping is high if walking on the root formations. If the water is also deep, you cannot simply wade through this type of swamp either. Use a small vessel if you need to travel through this type of swamp, noting that you may still have trouble getting around.

Jungle swamp or marsh: these will often have very lush growth of tough and thick reeds that grow up to 15 feet (4.6 m) in height where there is plenty of water. Walking in a jungle marsh involves restricted observation at ground level to a few feet and the footing will be much less secure than any other jungle surface.
Freshwater marsh: These marshes are usually 1 to 6 feet (0.3 to 1.8 m) in depth. In the United States, the largest freshwater marshes are those in the Florida Everglades.
Salt swamps: These occur in the arid areas and can turn into lakes during a rainy season. Due to their saltiness, few plants grow in them. They can be crossed easily when dry and crusty but when they're wet, they can have deep and sticky mud that is impassable.
Saltwater marsh: This forms as a result of tidal activity and is highly saline. These are located by the sea, in river deltas and intertidal zones. They are often covered with grass-like plants rather than bushes or trees. The main issue with crossing this kind of marsh is getting through the grass-like covering. Some marshes can be walked on top if they are thick enough. It is like walking on a trampoline because water is below the vegetative cover. Others you have to pull apart or crawl on your belly. Salt/Brackish water marshes in the South USA are favorites places of Alligators and Water Moccasin snakes, best to avoid and make a lot of noise. If you get bit by a snake here, it will be next to impossible in some cases to rescue you in time due to slow travel. Be careful when crossing open water, you might get caught by an incoming tide and being prepared to swim back if that happens, taking care to avoid riptides, strong currents, or undertows.
Sphagnum moss bogs: Sphagnum moss is the source of peat bogs. While these bogs appear shallow from the surface, the decay underneath creates layers of muck that a walker does not want to fall into. When sphagnum moss covers and entire pond, it can become what is known as a ""quaking bog"". This bog trembles or quakes under the walker's feet and if you get stuck in a quaking bog, and sink into the muck below, ""escape is nearly impossible"".If the water below the bog is very deep, and there is nothing but sphagnum moss growing on top, there is nothing to grasp onto to pull oneself out. Peat bogs often have the remains of animals and even people who have fallen into them, kept immaculately for centuries owing to the bog's preserving acids. Know how to spot one and keep away!;
, This is because of the soft nature of the bio-silt beneath these water formations, which can add many more feet to the depth if you sink into it.In addition, bogs can seem secure but hide very deep water underneath the peat layer.

, If you're in snake country, be very careful for it's likely that the snakes use the swamps or marshes to travel. Swamps, marshes, and bogs also attract insects; have plenty of insect repellent and try to maintain your hygiene to avoid accumulating body odor which will attract insects. Best to tie a strap around the bottom of your pant legs to keep leeches out.


And do your homework to know whether there are beasts such as crocodiles or alligators in that water! Some bodies of water are just too unsafe to walk in because of the local wildlife.

, There are several possibilities for footwear in a swamp, ranging from bare feet to boots and waders; the choice will depend on the type of swamp and the safety needs. You should also wear a hat to protect your head from the sun, and if it's heavily infested with insects, add a head net for protection.


Wear loose, long-sleeved shirts that have a button down collar and cuffs.Paul Tawrell, author of the massive tome ""Camping & Wilderness Survival"" recommends wearing the Vietnam Jungle Boot for swamp walking.He says that this type of boot is lightweight, supportive and has meshed breather holes to let the water that gets into the boot escape.
You might consider walking barefoot but only if you know the depth of the swamp, the safety of the swamp in terms of animals, insects, and snarls, etc. Any roots, reeds, or litter (including old fencing) in a swamp, marsh, or bog presents a danger to a barefoot walker, as do leeches, snakes, worms (in infested areas of the world), and even fish. It is much easier to sprain an ankle or break a toe by getting caught in root formations when you're bare foot.
Follow the lead of duck hunters. Wear hip boots or chest waders walking in the swamp. You don't have to, but it's preferable.
If the water is reasonably warm, you can walk wearing jeans and an old pair of sneakers but not anything that you plan on wearing on your next date!

, Unless you're confronted by having to cross a swamp or marsh in an emergency situation, take your time to learn about the swamp you intend walking in. Find out from locals what they know about it, and ask anyone else you know who has walked in it what advice they have to offer. If it's regularly used, such as for hunting, then there will be a lot of people who have experience with the swamp.


Look online for information about the swamp, marsh or bog. If it's a series of swamps, see whether hiking books or travel guides have covered methods for crossing them.
If you're in a national park or other sort of reserve run by government, corporate, or non-profit entities, avail yourself of their information, maps, advice, and warnings. They will know the terrain better than you and can quickly bring you up to speed.
Ask a local hiking club for information about crossing the swamp. They may have traversed it on their own walks or they may have warnings about it.
Get a detailed map of the area and know how the terrain changes. It's also a good idea to have a compass with you.
Get yourself a guide. What better way to discover a new swamp or bog than with a guide who knows where to go?

, If there are boardwalks, stay on them when walking through swamp areas. They are there for several very good reasons – to protect you and your walking gear, to protect the fragile nature of the plants growing in the marsh, bog, or swamp, and to direct pedestrian traffic in a way that causes minimal impact overall.

, All water activities are safer when you do them with a companion; going alone for any outdoor activity is asking for trouble if something goes wrong. Take along a companion or more and share your knowledge.

, If you don't know the depth of the water, use a measure such as a walking stick, branch, or some other item that can register at least the water depth. Clearly if the measure signals a depth that's too much for a human to wade through, avoid crossing it on foot.

, If there is a body of water next to the swamp, you can be fairly sure that firm ground can be found on the crest of that bank although it, too, may appear muddy. The ground on the bank opposite from the lake, bay or stream has a tendency to retain water and often is quite soft.


Look for vegetation and pods of roots to step on as you walk. They will not hold you up forever but will decrease how much you sink until the next step.
Avoid mud flats unless you have tested them. Often they can be sand based but in many tidal areas they are almost like quicksand.
Look at areas where there are cattails and phragmites (reeds) as they can usually support a person moving through the area.
Be aware that when crossing ditches and streams in the swamp where water is flowing you will find the center of the stream to be firm. Most of the time it will have a sandy or gravel bottom; the challenge is to determine how deep the soft edges of the stream are with silt before you get to the firm middle. The opposite side of the firm middle will usually mirror the soft side you have just passed through. If you make it to the middle okay, you are likely to make it across.

, The secret to walking in the swamp, aside from reading the terrain, is the technique:


Take your second step before the first one is complete, almost as if you're gliding instead of walking. If you try to walk in a swamp like walking on land, you'll try to take a step, wait to hit firm bottom and then step again, wait for a firm bottom, then pull up the first step only to find that suction has taken affect and they can't get the foot out; in actual fact, you've just put too much weight onto one foot in walking this way and when you try to pull out the second step, you'll find the same problem of being stuck. Eventually, you will get your feet out and move on but it's exhausting walking like this.
So, remember to take the second step before the first step hits bottom. As the second step is going down, pull up on the first one. Repeat the process. It takes a little skill and leg fitness, but if you don't have that, what the heck are you doing walking around in the swamp anyway?!

, Once you have negotiated a swamp, use natural markers like trees to remember where the passable areas are. After a while you'll get the feel for it and cruise through the swamp in a manner similar to walking on dry land.

, Treat sinking into a swamp, bog, or marsh in the same manner as for sinking into quicksand – indeed, contrary to common belief quicksand is rare in desert terrain but is found mostly in marshes and near rivers and lakes.Here is what to do if you get caught in quicksand, sinking bio-silt, or mire:Do not panic, do not struggle, and do not flail about. These are all guaranteed to cause you to sink in deeper, and quickly.
Avoid trying to lift one foot as this will place all of your weight on the other foot, and you'll sink deeper.
Drop to your hands and knees. Sure, you're going to wet and very messy but that's better than the alternative of getting hopelessly stuck in or submerged by mud or quicksand. The surface area created by your hands, knees, and legs will help to distribute the weight more evenly across the swamp's surface, an area far wider than just your feet. If the mire beneath you feels too soft and you're still sinking after dropping to a crawling position, lie down completely and be prepared to move only one part of your body at a time. The human body is less dense than quicksand, so aiming to ""float"" on it can reduce it to a nuisance rather than a danger.Visualize yourself as a snake, and make snake-like movements to attempt to ""float"" out of the sinking area of the swamp. Head back in the direction you came from.

, When you emerge from a swamp, bog, or marsh, you might have some guests hitching a lift. Do a quick body check to remove leeches. If you're walking in an area known for disease vectors, know what to do to remove them or to prevent them from latching on (ask local doctors before walking, or read up the information).

Be aware of your settings as they change.",How to Make a Ghillie Suit," Though it’s easiest to start with a camouflage outfit, you can make a camo suit out of normal clothing using spray-paint and/or fabric patches that match the surroundings.


An expensive suit can be bought which already have a good deal of camouflage built in. It will likely look like a basic camo with flap on it.
Cheaper suits can also be bought which only break up your outline (no camo, only a solid color), but with a few branches and such from your surrounding attached, it can blend in quite nicely.
Basic ghillie suits can be bought that consist of a net poncho with flaps attached to it. This is a great start as it breaks up your outline and gives you many locations to attach items to it.
Military flight suits and BDU's (Battle Dress Uniform) work very well.
You might re-purpose a durable mechanic's suit or similar work outfit.
Always choose base colors that will match the terrain you are trying to hide in. In a brush desert environment, a heavy green woodland suit stands out almost as badly as a city-dressed person.;
, Sew knots of mesh netting to the fabric with transparent thread like fishing line. Dental floss, though white, works very well and will not fray. Apply a drop of glue for extra strength. (Shoe glue works the best.)


Another way to apply the mesh is to glue it onto the suit. Take mesh netting that's roughly the same size as the suit and apply glue to shoe glue to corners of the netting every couple inches. Allow to dry. With a pair of scissors, cut the mesh off around the suit, being careful not accidentally cut into parts of the suit proper. When you're done, the mesh netting shouldn't raise off the suit more than 2 inches (5.1 cm) at any one point.

, Jute is a vegetable fiber that forms the bulk of the outside camouflage of a ghillie suit. You can purchase jute twine from most supply stores, or you can simply buy a burlap sack and make the jute yourself. Here's how:


Cut a large (~2'x5') rectangle out of a burlap sack. Make a cut along the upper or lower seam so that the burlap material is ready to be loosened. Sit down, anchor the sides of the burlap with your two heels, and start pulling out the burlap fibers that are running horizontal to you.
Pull out enough horizontal fabric until the remaining vertical fabric is roughly the same length as the horizontal fabric you've already pulled out. When it is, take a scissor and cut the fibers off from the sack. Place these along with the rest of the fibers you've shorn from the sack.
Shoot to get your burlap strands about 7"" to 14"" in length.

, If you decide to use a cheap burlap sack as your jute, you're going to want to dye the burlap the color of your surroundings. Identify greens, browns, even greys in the environment in which you'll be using the ghillie suit and match them with specific dye colors. Follow the instructions on the dye packets for staining the jute strands.


Once the jute strands are dyed, run them through cold water until the water starts coming out clear. Set the strands out to dry in the sun.
Don't be alarmed if the colors turn out darker right out of the dye. While they're still damp, the dye tends to look darker. As it dries, the color turns lighter. Let the jute dry completely before making a determination about the color.
If you think the color is too dark and not realistic, you can submerge the fabric in a water solution diluted with bleach. Start off with a 1:10 bleach to water ratio to begin with and adjust from there.

, Grab about 10 or so strands of jute, clump them together, and then tie them to the mesh netting using a simple overhand knot. Remember to choose 3 or 4 colors that are prevalent in the environment you'll be using your ghillie suit in.


You want to try to randomize colors to avoid over saturation of one type of color in one spot. Work with clumps of a single color at a time, and place them as randomly on the suit as possible.
Remember, the longer the strands, the less of a ""natural terrain"" look you will have.

, Bald spots are where there's insufficient coverage, making the suit look less realistic. Pick your ghillie suit up, lightly wave it in the air, and set it back down again. Add necessary clumps of jute to any bald spots.

, If you've done a good job dying your jute and tying it to the suit, you may not need to do this. But, at the end of the day, it really can't hurt. Wear in the webbing by dragging it behind a vehicle, soaking it in mud, or applying manure. This will help eliminate human scent, especially if the ghillie suit will be used for hunting purposes.

, There are essentially two ways to make a ghillie hood. The easiest way is to cut out an oval piece of mesh netting and simply drape it over your head like a veil. (This tends to fall off easily.) The second way is to glue an oval piece of netting over a hat, the same way you attach the mesh webbing to the suit.


After you've decided on the form of your hood, use the same approach to tie clumps of jute to the suit that you used in previous steps. Weave a bit of organic material, such as shrubbery, grass, or even sticks into the mesh.
Make sure that the amount of jute on the hood is proportional to the amount of jute on the suit. Lay the hood over the suit itself and see if the jute blends in. If it looks a little light, add more jute; if it looks a little heavy, take some off.

, Do this each time you intend on wearing the ghillie, and spend a good 15 to 20 minutes interlacing organic material from the area into the webbing. If you are in a wooded area, for example, attach small branches and leaves to the upper half of the suit and feather it to the bottom with items such as grass or twigs.


Attach more items to the back of the suit than the front; sneaking in a ghillie suit usually involves crawling. Items on your stomach or chest as you belly-crawl will likely get damaged or make noise.
Attach wider items around your head and neck. The human head is the most commonly identified part of the body and the shoulders and neck exaggerate the head. When standing still, your outline must be broken to prevent easy identification.

, If it is possible to stay in the same kind of terrain as you get from point A to point B, do so. Otherwise, you'll have to incorporate the materials of the new setting you're moving into as you go along.

Choose a location that is fairly well drained and not subject to erosion or flooding for your food plot.,
Clear away brush and trees from the plot.,
Test the soil for ph and nutrients, matching these to the crop you are going to plant.,
Spread fertilizer in the area to spur plant growth.,
Spread the seeds according to package instructions.,
Keep the food plot away from other plants or gardens if you don’t want deer to eat those too.,
Provide the deer with a water source.",How to Attract Deer1," In many states, feeding deer at certain times of the year is illegal and is discouraged. Deer that are fed may become nuisances to people.;
, Deer might not come close if there is a lot of traffic nearby, and luring deer into the path of traffic can have serious consequences.

, A food plot is an area of land that you clear and seed with plants that deer like to eat. You could also plant several food plots throughout your property.


Deer are drawn to crops that are high in protein, such as kale, turnips, soybeans, peas, and alfalfa. A mix of plants that include clover and grasses, like wheat, oats and rye, will attract deer. Experts suggest that you plant 60 percent cool-season perennials like clovers, 20 percent cool-season annuals like turnip and kale, and 20 percent warm-season annuals, like corn, soybeans and alfalfa.Deer also like nuts such as chestnuts and acorns. While it may be a long wait for results, planting mast trees such as these will eventually offer deer some of their favorite foods when the trees begin to bear nuts. Other trees that produce fruit deer like are persimmons, pears, and apples. Determine which trees will succeed in your location.

, Thus, if there are cornfields nearby, planting corn might not be as productive.Some hunting stores sell seed mixes that are created specifically for deer food plots.
Local seed stores also can sell bulk seed to allow you to create your own blend, with winter peas, fescue, vetch, and sun hemp.

, Planting on steep terrain or in a flood plain isn't a good idea.

, Depending on the plot size and the density of the existing vegetation, you may find you need a tractor with suitable implements to clear and prepare the ground for planting.

, As a general rule, a ph between 6.0 and 7.5 will support plant growth, beyond this range and you may need to add amendments to modify the soil chemistry.

, You will need to try to incorporate the fertilizer into the top 4 inches of soil so it doesn't run off during rain.

, Usually, grains like oats and rye are applied at about 40-50 pounds per acre, and once the seed is spread you will want to rake or disc it in to improve germination.

, Place the food plot away from areas that could flood. Food plots for deer can range from 1,000 square feet to several acres.

, Deer will be drawn to water. This could come in the form of a watering hole or a tank.Make sure you maintain trees on either side of rivers or other waterways to stop erosion and reduce the risk of polluting these streams.
Deer also like the cover from the trees.
Deer might be drawn to water in a plastic kiddie poll or a pedestal birdbath too."

Place the shot immediately behind the front shoulder of the bear.",How to Bear Hunt2," Bears are capable of consuming a wide variety of foods from large calorie sources to gain summer fat.


Grizzly bears occupy the high country and are found on rock faces during the summer months. The bears peel rocks away from scree slopes in search of protein rich moths and other insects. The bears also forage for plants and occupy areas close to game herds for hunting.
Black bears are opportunistic and will utilize a variety of food sources. The bears hunt game, forage for plants and insects, and target trash from humans.
Brown bears are often associated with salmon runs in the river valleys. They occupy low elevations and will hunt moose or forage until the salmon arrive.

, The techniques may be used together or separately to draw bears within shooting distance.


Burnt sugar and lard baits are extremely effective for attracting bears, but the technique is illegal in some areas. Check the local regulations before implementing this technique.
Wounded game calls use high pitch squeals to imitate dying rabbits and other distressed animals. The calls are widely available through outdoor stores and require blowing into a mouthpiece to create the sound.

, The bears will lead a chase for several hours but eventually the animals will tire and seek refuge in a tree.


Train by hiking long distances and running on a regular basis. Running hounds requires the hunter to be in excellent physical condition.
Be prepared to use your weapon. Bear may turn and attack the dogs and hunters.

, Tree stand hunters may use baits or calls to attract bears, and the vantage point allows the hunter to make a shot without alerting the bear to his or her presence.

, This location allows penetration through the skin and into the vital organs, which will quickly kill bears.

Choose deer urine as a lure.,
Hang scent wicks.,
Try using sweet apples.,
Use a salt block.,
Buy commercial lures.,
Use a game/trail camera to monitor your food plot.",How to Attract Deer2," This can be one of the most effective scents for drawing deer to an area. Hunters often use deer lure, but they can also be used to attract the animals for the simple pleasure of viewing them.


Put the deer urine lure around the area of your property where you want to draw deer. Apply doe scent on grass or trees if you want to lure bucks.
Deer will be most drawn to the scent about 10 weeks before the height of the local deer's breeding season.

, If you are in a hunting stand, hang scent wicks around your tree stand.The scent wicks are often saturated with buck urine.


Put the scent wicks about 20 yards in front of the stand and make sure they are about four or five feet off the ground so the wind will disperse the scent.
Minimize human scent on the lure. Deer will be less attracted to the lure if they also smell human scent. So be careful when handling the lure. You can find deer scent in sporting or hunting goods stores.

, Some deer may love the smell of sweet apples, so you could draw them with the fruit or its scent. This will be on the condition that apples are part of your local deer populations food supply.


Plant an apple or crab apple tree around the edge of your yard. Deer will like the cover, the tender leaves, and the fruit produced by these trees.
You could also put apples in a tub or bucket in addition to grain or deer feed and see if that will draw the deer. You could also fill barrels or buckets with corn. Try using 5-gallon pails, and put them throughout your property.

, Deer may be drawn to salt and mineral blocks, as well as blocks made of cider and apple salt.


Feed stores and hunting goods stores should have these for sale. Place the salt blocks at the edge of your property.
If you have a food plot, you may want to locate the salt block there instead. Or you could put the salt block near a feeder. You could also bury the salt block in the ground, and sprinkle salt on top of it. It could take several weeks or even months for the deer to find the salt block, so be patient.

, You can find many different deer scents packaged for sale at sporting goods stores. They include some creative scent combinations said to increase the chances you will attract deer.


For example, some stores sell scented deer corn, such as orange-flavored corn.
Products flavored with apples, such as corn, liquids and other attractants are known to draw deer, who love apple scent., This will show you what animals are visiting your plot, and help you establish what foods the deer are feeding on, as well as what food other animals may be stealing.

"
"
Keep pets, especially dogs away from any area you want to attract deer to.,
Grow taller grass.,
Remove fences that will deter deer.,
Plant trees and shrubs that deer like.",How to Attract Deer3," Even the scent of a dog can frighten away deer.

, Deer prefer tall grass. So if you want a lot of deer in your yard, you could grow your grass longer. However, they also like a mixture of plant density.


Perhaps you could just grow the grass longer around the property’s perimeter.
Deer enjoy a mixture of cleared areas, young trees and shrubs that provide cover and aid their diets and mature hardwood forests. They like to be on the edges of forests with a lot of different plants and densities. They often forage in clearings, especially at night, but they like to hide in the daylight in thicker foliage.

, If you have fences around your yard, deer may not be able to move around your property.


If removing a fence is not possible, you could create an opening within the fence for the deer to pass through.
Reduce bright lights and sounds. These things can scare deer, and make them stay away from your property. A lot of human activity on your property also might keep deer away.

, Deer will be drawn to certain trees and shrubs. If you plant them throughout your property, they will be a natural draw.


Blackberry trees, elderberry, juniper, red cedar, Douglas fir, and flowering dogwood are enjoyed by deer.
Plant flowering plants. Deer will like blooming plans and legumes. Pay attention to the edges of your property. Deer often hang out around the edges of properties especially if there is foliage that provides them cover."

Get a cleaning kit.,
Unload your gun.,
Disassemble your gun only as much as the manufacturer recommends.,
Always clean your gun in a well-ventilated area.,
Clean out the barrel with cleaning rod and patches.,
Alternate the bore brush and patches to thoroughly scrub the barrel.,
Lubricate the barrel.,
Clean and lubricate the action with solvent.,
Wipe down the rest of your gun with a luster cloth.,
Clean your gun after every use.,
Consider investing in a barrel snake and/or ultrasonic cleaners.,
Store your guns unloaded in a cool and dry environment.",How to Clean a Gun," Whether you purchase a pre-assmebled cleaning kit from a sporting goods store or you assemble the necessary components individually, you'll need a few basic things to have in your arsenal of cleaning supplies. A basic set includes:


Cleaning solvent
Lubricant, or gun oil
A bore brush
A patch holder and patches
Cleaning rod
A nylon cleaning brush
Flashlight
Cotton swabs
Microfiber cloths for polishing;
, Always take the time to properly unload your gun and double-check to make sure that it's unloaded every time you pick it up to clean it. Remember that your gun may still have a round ready to fire after you remove the magazine, so check and remove this round.


After opening the chamber, look through the barrel from back to front. Confirm that no round remains inside, either in the chamber or stuck in the barrel. No gun can be considered unloaded until you have looked through the barrel.

, Check the owner's manual for disassembly instructions to prepare the gun for cleaning. This will allow you to access all parts that become dirty from firing.


Semi-automatic pistols and rifles will generally be stripped into their major components: barrel, slide, guide rod, frame and magazine. Revolvers, shotguns, and most other sorts of guns will not need to be stripped to clean them.Field stripping is not necessary to clean the gun thoroughly. Don't take apart your gun more than you have to unless it requires repair. Likewise, some guns can't be stripped at all and it won't be necessary to do anything but open the chamber to clean it.

, Find a a place with good air circulation to clean your guns. Solvent fumes are noxious and can make you sick. Likewise, the solvent and lubricant used just flat-out smell foul if you try to clean your guns indoors, so keep your family happy and don't stink up the joint.


Cover your work surface with plastic bags, newspaper, or old towels you've saved for the purpose. Head out to the garage and put the door up, or clean your guns on a bright and dry day to get them cleaned properly.

, Soak the bore, or inside of the barrel, using a cleaning rod, patch holder and the right size cotton patches for your gun. Work from the back of the bore if you can. If not, use a muzzle guard. The muzzle guard keeps the cleaning rod from banging against the muzzle, which can cause your gun to malfunction.


To thoroughly clean the barrel out, push a solvent-soaked patch through the bore until it exits the other end. Remove the patch, don't pull it back through. Pulling it back through will just redeposit all the gunk you clean off., Remove the patch holder and attach the bore brush. Run the bore brush back and forth along the full length of the bore 3 or 4 times to loosen any debris. Next, reattach the patch holder and run solvent-soaked cotton patches through the bore. Remove them when they exit the front. Repeat this process until a patch comes out clean.


Run one more dry patch through to dry it out and inspect it closely for any build-up you may have missed.

, Attach the cotton mop to the cleaning rod. Apply a few drops of gun conditioner or lubricant to the cotton mop and run it through the bore to leave a light coating of gun oil on the inside., Apply solvent to the gun brush and brush all parts of the action. Wipe them dry with a clean cloth.


Next, lubricate the moving parts of the action lightly. A light coating helps prevent rust. A heavy coating gets gummy and attracts debris, so only use a small amount.

, This is a flannel cloth that comes pre-treated with a silicon lubricant. It will remove any remaining debris, including acid from fingerprints, and add shine.


If you don't have a particular cloth designated for cleaning guns, old t-shirts and pairs of socks work really well for the purpose. Use something you've got lying around and won't need to reuse.

, A good-quality firearm is a significant investment, whether you're using it for sport, hunting, or home defense. Make sure you give it the attention it deserves whenever you get back from a round of firing it.


The whole cleaning process, start to finish, only takes 20 or 30 minutes. It's worth it to do it regularly. You might even consider getting out old guns from the back of the closet and doing them all at once while you've got the materials out. Can't hurt.

, Like everything else, gun cleaning technology is cutting edge. For rifles and shotguns, barrel snakes are long multi-purpose cleaners that make the job much quicker and easier, some featuring lights on the end that allow you to see the interior of the barrel much more easily. It cuts down on time and makes the job more efficient.

, To ensure the longest life for your gun, don't store them anywhere they'll be significantly affected by the elements. Keep them indoors, in temperature-controlled environments. Consider investing in trigger locks to keep your gun safe and tamper proof.


Soft or hard cases are available for guns, anywhere as cheap as $15 or $20. If you have a higher budget, there are also lockable gun cabinets and safes made for the purpose of storing guns in a controlled and locked environment."

Bring a valid, non-expired driver's license or identification card issued by the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).You can show military identification instead if you also have permanent duty station orders that prove you're posted in California.;
, Federal law 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) and various California laws disqualify you from gun ownership if you have been convicted of the following crimes (and sometimes if you are currently charged with one):Any crime punishable by more than one year in prison.
Any violent offense (bans from misdemeanors may be temporary)
Misdemeanors related to assault, intimidation, stalking, domestic violence, or firearms can lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

, If you pass the above tests, you can buy a rifle or shotgun. If you plan to buy a handgun, you also need to bring proof of California residency. This could be a utility bill, residential lease, property deed, or government-issued identification (in addition to the DMV card)., If you have a corner case and are not sure whether you're eligible, fill out this PFEC request form. You should get a response within 60 days telling you whether you're eligible to buy a firearm.


This costs $20, plus the cost of notarizing the document.A PFEC is never required. The only reason to have it done is to avoid the hassle of purchasing a gun, then having it denied after the waiting period.

, California now requires this certificate for most firearm purchases, even for shotguns and rifles. There are a few exemptions that let you skip this section:You have a hunting license and are purchasing a long gun.
You are in the military or CA/federal police force, or honorably retired from it.
You have a Special Weapons Permit or Carry Concealed Weapon (CCW) Permit.
If you have the old Handgun Safety Certificate, you can use it instead until it expires.

The dealer is allowed to charge an extra $10 per firearm, in addition to normal state fees., Most gun shops will allow you to touch and hold the firearms before you purchase them. If you're not familiar with firearms, ask the employees for advice or refer to the following articles:



Choose a handgun. Good for self-defense and concealed carry, but short-range and poor hunting weapons. They require a lot of practice and dexterity to use effectively.

Choose a rifle. Used for both hunting and home defense. Bolt action rifles are typically cheaper than semi-automatic rifles.

Choose a shotgun. Arguably the most versatile weapon. Shotguns can be loaded with slugs or buckshot, depending on the intended purpose.

Choose a firearm for self defense. Each type of gun has its own advantages in this scenario.

, The cashier will need valid your California-issued drivers license or ID card. Depending on the dealer, you may pay full price now, or just a deposit.You will be required to sign some papers (ATF Form 4473, DROS), which will need to be filled out with place of residency and other information. It will also require your right thumb print.


Some purchases require extra documents, as described in the eligibility section above.
In California, you are only allowed to purchase one handgun within a 30-day period.There is no time limit for long guns, or for antique guns if you have a collector's license.

, A DOJ Certified Instructor (typically at the gun store) will walk you through safe handling instructions, and sign a statement saying you completed them.


You are not required to do this until you pick up the firearm. However, the state of California recommends you do this before you finalize the sale, to make sure you know how to use the firearm., Each transaction (for any number of firearms) costs you $25 in DROS (Dealer Record of Sales) and related state fees. If you are buying directly from a firearm dealer, ask them if they have any extra fees now before you place the order.If you are buying from another private party, the gun dealer overseeing the purchase is only allowed to charge $10 per firearm, plus the state fees.

, In almost all cases, you are required to wait ten days before picking up the firearm (exactly 240 hours after submitting the DROS). During this time your DROS information is being sent to the CA DMV, CA DOJ, and then on to the FBI NICS. Each of these organizations has an opportunity to deny your application, or to delay it if they need more time to investigate.


The dealer must give you a copy of your DROS information upon request, proving that you were denied or accepted.The dealer is legally required to cancel the sale if you do not show up within 30 days of submitting the DROS., Now is a good time to purchase a California-approved firearms safe (or locking device).

Learn if you need a permit or license to own a firearm, where you can carry it and whether you can conceal it. Most states allow concealed carry, some require you to pass a firearms class and demonstrate proficiency with your firearm on the shooting range.;
,


Revolvers are easy to use and malfunction infrequently, but they are bulky and difficult to reload quickly.






Semiautomatic pistols are sleeker, making them easier to carry concealed. However, they are complicated to operate and more prone to malfunction. Semiautomatics are loaded by attaching a magazine. If you carry additional magazines, you can typically reload in seconds.







, Try several to find the one that suits you best. You may want several kinds of holsters so you can carry concealed no matter what kind of clothing you wear. There are many different potential ways to carry. Some people prefer to carry a small pistol in the pocket. Some like a shoulder holster because it allows the carriage of a larger frame pistol. The choice is up to you.


The most popular holster for carrying concealed is the inside waistband (IWB) holster. It attaches to your belt with the holster partially or completely hidden between your pants and your body. You can wear an IWB holster in a number of positions, from the small of the back to the front of the hip.






Shoulder holsters allow you to carry your firearm under one arm. It requires that you wear a jacket to conceal your weapon.






Other holsters for carrying concealed include: ankle holsters, which can be concealed under pant legs; belly bands, which allow you to wear your weapon under your shirt; and pocket holsters, which allow you to carry your gun safely in a front pocket.







, You should be able to smoothly and safely remove it from the holster and re-holster it. Do not practice with a loaded weapon so you won't accidentally fire it.

, Be prepared to leave your weapon behind at home, in the office or in your car when necessary. Be sure that your gun is safely stored behind a lock wherever you leave it behind to prevent accidents or theft.


State or federal laws may ban you from carrying concealed in certain places, like schools or bars. However, many states allow private businesses to post signs banning handguns on their premises.







, Generally, neighboring states will recognize a concealed carry permit issued by your state, but there are important exceptions. Don't assume that you will always be able to carry your weapon in other states. This is a very complex environment that is changing everyday. Be sure to consult the state that you are entering and if they honor your particular license.

Find out what gauge of shotgun you are buying ammo for.,
Find out if your shotgun barrel is rifled.,
Decide what you are going to use the ammo for:


For small animals or clay targets, buy shotshells with small shot (""birdshot"", #9 up to, say #4) in them.",How to Choose a Shotgun2," The common gauges are 10, 12, 16, 20, 28, and .410. 28 is smaller than 20 which is smaller than 16. The larger the gauge, the smaller in diameter the shell is .410 is an odd exception, just remember it is the smallest.

, If it is, you can only shoot slugs - preferentially ""sabot slugs"". If your barrel does not have grooves in it, you can shoot everything, including sabot slugs - though the slugs won't be very accurate.

, Not only are they the cheapest shells available, but they are gentler on your shotgun and (generally) your shoulder.
For larger small animals, such as ducks up to large geese, you should buy shotshells with somewhat larger shot, say #5 up to #2.
For larger animals, such as coyotes or deer, it is best to use slugs - the largest round available in a shotgun shell.

Alternatively, you may choose to buy slugs for shooting large animals. Remember, sabot slugs for rifled barrels, ""rifled"" slugs for smooth barrels.


To fit a shotgun, Hold the shotgun with your dominant shooting hand with the barrel pointed up, rest the end of the shotgun stock in the crook of your arm, where your elbow is bent, if your trigger finger can reach the trigger comfortably then the gun fits your arm and fits you!

Pay the fees with a credit card or bring separate money orders for each fee. Make your money orders payable to ""New York City Police Department.""

, You will probably have to wait one to three months before you receive a letter identifying the officer who has been assigned to your application. The letter will ask that you schedule an interview. Call during regular business hours to schedule the interview.The officer might also request additional documents.For example, you may have to sign an Affidavit of Familiarity, in which you state that you are familiar with New York’s gun laws.
You also might need an affidavit from someone who is living with you, stating they don’t object to you getting a license.

, You also might need to supply the officer with three references from people who have known you for the past two years. You should think about who you can get to supply the reference. The reference should agree that you have “good moral character.”The letter should also be signed and notarized., You should dress in clean, neat clothes. The key is to look presentable. You will be asked a variety of questions, which will vary depending on who is interviewing. Generally, you can expect to be asked the following:Why do you want a gun? (Sample answer: For home defense.)
Where will you store the gun and the ammunition? (Answer: The gun will be stored unloaded in a safe with a trigger lock. The ammo will be stored in a separate safe.)
How will you transport the gun? (Answer: In a locked box, unloaded, and with a trigger lock. Ammo will be in a separate container.)
Have you owned a gun before? (If yes, supply details—type of gun, if there were any problems, etc.)
Have you ever been assaulted or had your home robbed? (If yes, provided details and the dates.)
When is it acceptable to use deadly force? (Answer: When someone has broken into your home and demonstrated an intent to kill you or someone else in the home. The answer is not, “When I feel scared.”)

, You will probably have to wait another one to three months before you hear back. If your application is denied, then find a lawyer who can file an appeal for you. Don’t delay.


If you are approved, you must pick up your Purchase Authorization within 30 days., Take your approval letter and return to the License Division office at 1 Police Plaza, Room 110, New York, New York 10038 to obtain this form.


Call the Purchase Order Section at 646-610-5550 for alternate directions on how to obtain the form.

, Once you receive your Purchase Authorization, you have 30 days to buy a handgun from a dealer with a Federal Firearms License (FFL). You can find an FFL dealer by using the locator tool at the National Shooting Sports Foundation website: http://nssf.org/retailers/find/.


Make sure that new guns are NY compliant.
The FFL should fill out your Purchase Authorization form.

, You can also buy from a dealer outside New York state. However, the dealer must transfer the gun to an FFL in the city.Because a non-New York dealer might not know if a gun is New York compliant, you should read up on New York’s gun prohibitions.


The National Rifle Association has a good summary of what guns are illegal in New York: https://www.nraila.org/gun-laws/state-gun-laws/new-york/.

, After you purchase your gun, you have 72 hours to return to the License Division to have the gun inspected.This 72 hours includes weekends as well, so don’t delay. Make sure the firearm is unloaded with the trigger locked and in a locked case.Also take two copies of the purchase receipt and your completed Purchase Authorization form.
The License Division will then update your handgun license with the new handgun information, including the make, model, caliber and serial number of the gun.
Double check that the information has been recorded properly and that there are no typos.

, You can buy a new pistol, revolver, or handgun every 90 days.To purchase another gun, you must complete a Purchase Authorization Request Form and submit it to the License Division. They will then send you a Purchase Authorization form, which you take to the FFL dealer. It generally takes about 45-60 days to get approval.You must have all new guns inspected by the License Division just as you did your first gun.

, If you have a handgun license, you can request that your personal information not be made publicly available by completing an FOIL exemption form. The form and instructions are available at: https://troopers.ny.gov/Firearms/Public_Records_Exemption/.


Mail the completed form to Commanding Officer, License Division, 1 Police Plaza, Room 152B, New York, NY 10038, Attention: Records Unit."

Pick up the gun when the dealer notifies you.",How to Buy a Gun Online1," Before you start looking, know what federal, state, and local regulations you need to observe. You also need to have a good idea of what you want to buy when you start looking.


On a federal level, you are legally eligible to buy any type of long gun, such as a rifle or shotgun, as long as you are over the age of 18 and are not a convicted felon. You are legally eligible to buy a handgun if you are over the age of 21 and are not a convicted felon.State and local restrictions vary, however, so you need to verify that there are no restrictions preventing you from buying or owning a gun within your city or state. For instance, some states do not permit anyone with a domestic violence conviction to own a gun even when this conviction is a misdemeanor. Others have restrictions on the type of gun you can own or buy, as is the case with Chicago's ban on handguns. Some municipalities, like Washington, D.C., prohibit the possession of guns within the municipality’s borders altogether.;
, This license permits the business to engage more thoroughly in the interstate and intrastate sale of firearms and related products.


A registered business that sells firearms will likely be an FFL holder. Still, you should verify that this is the case by going to the website's “About” or “FAQ” page and checking to see if they have an FFL.

, No one can ship a gun directly to your home or business address. Instead, you will need to choose a nearby firearms dealer to ship the gun to, and the dealer must have an FFL. You will later need to pick up the gun from that dealer directly.


You should contact your local gun shop first before choosing that shop as your shipping destination. First of all, doing so establishes a relationship with that gun shop and may make the transaction easier overall. Some gun shop owners will not even handle the transfer of guns purchased on the Internet, so you need to check with the shop to make sure that it is okay to have your gun ship to them.
Secondly, doing so also allows you to find out about any state or local rules regarding the sale and ownership of guns in your area. Asking the local gun shop about such regulations is probably the simplest way to find out what these laws actually are.

, When you buy from an online FFL holder, you will need to agree to a background check to verify that you are legally allowed to own a gun. The FFL holder you are buying from will likely run this check.


If the FFL holder you are purchasing from does the background check, you will need to complete a telephone interview ahead of time before you can place your order. It might take several hours to several days before you receive confirmation on whether or not you can make a purchase.
Alternatively, if you talk to the FFL dealer who the gun will be shipped to ahead of time, that dealer may run the check, instead. You will need to fill out paperwork and answer all questions about your identity and history as accurately as possible. You may need to wait several hours or days to find out if you are legally allowed to buy a gun.

, Once the details are straightened out, you need to actually place your order with the online gun dealer. Check with the dealer ahead of time to find out if there are any special procedures you need to follow when ordering with the business.


Note that there might be a fee involved when you have to work through FFL dealers to transfer your gun. The fee is usually nominal when compared to the overall cost of the gun, though.
When you check out, you will need to enter your name and address under the “billing address” section. For the shipping address, however, you will need to enter your name and the address of the FFL dealer you wish to ship the gun to.

, Once your gun arrives at the FFL dealer you had it shipped to, you should receive a phone call or other notification that your gun is ready for you to pick up. You will need to drive there and retrieve your purchase in person.


You will need to pick up your gun in person. You cannot have someone else get it for you.

, If the seller is a professional, he or she might have a standard protocol that you will need to follow, and you may not need to contact the seller directly. If no such protocol is posted publicly, however, you should contact the seller directly to let him or her know that you intend to make a purchase.


If the seller has worked with customers in your area in the past, he or she might have a recommended FFL dealer for you to work through during the transfer of your gun.

, Even when buying from a non-FFL seller, you will still need to have the order shipped to a local FFL dealer. You cannot have the gun shipped directly to your house, place of business, or post office.

, Once the details are set, formally place your order with the seller according to his or her terms of purchase.


The FFL dealer receiving your gun may require you to pay a fee for his or her services.
When you check out, you will need to provide your name and address for billing purposes as well as the address of the FFL dealer you have chosen to ship your gun to.

, Before you can pick up your gun, you will need to undergo a background check through the FFL dealer who receives it. Once you are cleared, you can pick up the gun as soon as it arrives at the dealer's place of business.


It is generally a good idea to complete this background check before you even make the purchase. If you wait until afterward and you fail the background check, you will not be able to take the firearm and, depending on the terms of your agreement with the seller, you may not even be able to get your money back.

Some municipalities, like Washington, D.C., prohibit the possession of guns within the municipality’s borders altogether.
Note that you may wish to contact a local gun store before buying a gun in a private transaction. While doing so is not strictly necessary, you can learn from the shop about local and state regulations governing the purchase or ownership of a gun.
If you do not wish to find out about regulations from a local gun shop, consider contacting your local government, the NRA, or a local organization focused on gun ownership rights. These sources can also give you the information you need concerning what is and is not legal in your area.

, Let the seller know that you are interested in making a purchase and discuss with him or her your preferred method of doing so. If you intend to keep the purchase completely private, you will need to meet with the seller in person and pick up the gun in person, but the details of the transaction can be arranged online ahead of time.


You can usually find a private seller by looking for online ads. Do an Internet search for gun owner community forums and check for a specific message board dedicated to the trade and sale of firearms.
While the vast majority of states will require you to make a gun sale in person, there are some situations that allow long guns to be mailed unloaded as long as it is mailed within the same state. These guns must comply with all regulations of the Federal Gun Control Act of 1968and must not be capable of being concealed. Moreover, the mailer might be required to open the package and prove that the firearm is in the correct condition to be shipped. The mailer must also fill out a PS Form 1508, ""Statement by Shipper of Firearms.""Note that unloaded antique firearms are also acceptable for mailing within the state as long as they are mailed with the purpose of becoming curios or museum pieces.

, The entire transaction itself needs to occur in person if you intend on keeping it private. If you meet privately with the seller, you do not need to go through a background check ahead of time.

Note that some states require background checks even for the private sale of guns. For instance, California and Rhode Island require background checks for all firearms sales, while 12 other states require such checks for all handgun sales. Other states with private gun sale regulations include Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, and New York.
Understand that a seller has the right to refuse to complete the transaction at any time before payment has been accepted. In fact, if a seller meets with you and suspects that you are a fugitive, an addict, a convicted felon, or mentally ill, he or she is legally obligated to refuse to sell you a firearm. In other words, a private sale might be more convenient, but you should not try to use it as a way of obtaining a gun if you are not legally allowed to own one.

Talk to your children about gun safety.",How to Buy an Assault Rifle," A modern assault rifle can shoot up to 300 meters and has selective firing mechanisms.Common assault rifles include the AK-47, M4A1 carbine, and M16.Also think about extra features that you might want with the assault rifle:sights
electronics
collapsible stocks
suppressors
lasers
drum magazines;
, If you don’t know what rifle you want, then try speaking to someone who is familiar with the different assault rifles on the market. You can stop by the nearest firing range to ask someone who works there if they have any advice for you.

, State law supplements federal law. Although federal law mandates background checks, it currently requires that checks only be performed if you purchase from a licensed dealer. Federal law does not mandate that background checks be performed when a sale is made between private parties.An individual state, however, can require that even private sellers perform background checks. You can find relevant state laws by visiting your local law library, which should be housed in your local courthouse.
Alternately, you can search the web. Type “assault rifle” or “assault weapon” and then your state into your favorite web browser. Look for state-specific laws on background checks, registration, and other requirements.

, The federal background check can typically be completed in a couple of minutes. Nevertheless, the FBI has up to three days to perform the check. If three days pass without hearing from the FBI, then the seller can proceed with the rifle sale.Federal law limits who may buy a gun that has shipped in interstate or international commerce. The following are some of the groups of people federal law prohibits from purchasing a firearm:anyone convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment of more than a year
a fugitive from justice
an illegal alien
someone under a restraining order for harassing or threatening an intimate partner or the child of an intimate partner
a person convicted of domestic violence



, If you know the exact type of rifle that you want, then you should comparison shop. There is no reason to purchase the first rifle that you find. Instead, you can compare prices from different retailers and take the best offer that you can find.


You can join gun groups on the web, including Facebook. By joining, you can stay up to date on the prices and availability of different assault rifles.Start early. If you need the rifle by a certain date, then you should give yourself a couple of months to search. You might need to visit multiple gun shows or contact several private dealers.

, Some assault rifles are for sale online. You can search for websites. One website is www.gunbroker.com. You can bid on assault rifles that meet your criteria.


You also might be able to make a private purchase through a gun group. Many members put guns up for sale. You can reach out and close a private sale without having to go through a background check.By contrast, some online sellers will require that you make the purchase through a Federal Firearms License (FFL) dealer. With an FFL dealer, you will have to undergo a background check. Some sellers prefer to use an FFL so that they can have a record of the sale and confirm that they are not selling to a felon., If you buy at a gun show from a private dealer, you can avoid a background check. Gun shows are held at various times of the year. To find a gun show near you, you can search the web. There are several websites which update a list of gun shows on a weekly basis.If you plan on traveling a distance, then call ahead of time to make sure that the gun show is still being held.
Some gun shows charge a small admission fee, usually around $5. Children are sometimes admitted for free., You will need to fill out a background check form if you purchase from a gun shop. Any gun shop that sells you an assault rifle legally will be an FFL., You may need to register your new rifle with the appropriate law enforcement agency. Instead of a comprehensive federal scheme, each state determines its own registration requirements.You should check with local law enforcement to find out what your state’s registration requirements are.


Several states prohibit all registries. Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, and Vermont all prohibit registries as of 2015.If you live in one of those states, then you will not have to register your new rifle.
If you do not want to ask law enforcement, for fear that they will now be suspicious that you have a gun, you can consult an attorney. An attorney will research the law and provide you with confidential advice about your registration obligations under the law.

, You should have all of your guns under lock and key. Also be sure to put a trigger lock or other safety device on the gun. You should then store any rifles in a locked container.You should think about safe storage even if you do not have children. Visitors, intruders, and other people could stumble upon a gun in your home and assume that it is not loaded. Also, if you ever get drunk or high, or if you hallucinate, then you could access an unlocked gun when you aren’t thinking clearly. By keeping the gun locked in a storage container, you ensure that you only handle the gun when you are thinking clearly.
You can get a safety device approved by the Department of Justice. You can find approved safety devices at https://oag.ca.gov/firearms/fsdcertlist.

, By storing the ammunition in a different location, you make it harder for any children to accidentally shoot the gun or for an intruder to gain access to a loaded gun.You should store ammunition in a locked container as well. This increases the safety.

, If you have children, then you will want to educate them about guns. No matter how careful you are, you might accidentally leave a gun out at some point. Your children should know what to do:Avoid touching the gun. Make sure your children understand not to pick up the gun or play with it. Instead, they should leave the area where the gun is immediately.
Tell an adult. Once they leave the gun area, they should go directly to an adult and tell him or her that the gun is out.

Reassemble the trigger mechanism.",How to Clean a Muzzleloader," You can do this by pulling back the bolt of the gun and checking for a ball and powder, or tilting the gun forward at a 45 degree angle. If you’re using a traditional muzzleloader ball as ammunition, it will roll out the front of the barrel. Never try to look down the barrel to see if there is a ball and powder in the firearm.


Attempting to clean any type of loaded gun could result in serious injury or death.The accidental discharge of a muzzleloader could be especially serious, due to the large caliber of the ball.;
, The bolt assembly is on top of the gun and holds the bolt (which slides back and forth, loading a round into the firing mechanism) in place. Take this apart by pulling the bolt assembly apart from the firing pin assembly (which will be located behind the bolt assembly). You may need to use a screwdriver to pry this open.For help clarifying the bolt assembly from the firing pin assembly, consult your firearm’s manual, which should feature a clear diagram labeling the parts of the gun and firing mechanism.

, There should be a notch on the firing pin assembly that you can pry open using a coin. Using the proper size of screwdriver, unscrew the firing pin assembly. This unit doesn’t need to be taken apart any further; do not attempt to remove the small firing pin itself., For this purpose, you’ll need a clean cotton cloth. Dampen this with a bore cleaner oil, and lightly wipe down all parts. Focus on removing all grime and gunpowder residue from the working mechanisms of the bolt assembly. Clean off all surfaces and mechanisms on the firing pin assembly as well. Once both assemblies are clean, dry them with a separate clean cotton cloth.Then, dampen another clean cloth with a light machinery lubricant oil. Rub this on the bolt and firing pin assemblies to lubricate the moving parts and help them stay clean., You’ll do this by performing the reverse of each of the steps used to disassemble the bolt and firing pin assemblies. Place the firing pin assembly back into the rear end of the bolt assembly, and tighten in place. Cock the bolt, and place it back into the receiver (its place on the stock of the gun). Tighten the bolt assembly, and un-cock the bolt.Do not reassemble the bolt assembly until you have finished cleaning the entire gun. You should set the bolt assembly and firing pin assembly safely to the side while you clean the barrel and trigger assembly. Then, reassemble the entire firearm once you’ve cleaned everything.

, The “breech” of a muzzle loader is in front of the bolt mechanism; think of it as the base end of the barrel. The breech plug is a roughly two-inch metal “plug” located at the back of the breech. You can unscrew this using your firearm’s combo tool or a screwdriver as needed.To find the specific location of the nipple and breech plug on your muzzleloader, consult the diagram or layout of the firearm that came with the gun.

, The ramrod is on the underside of the barrel, and can be slid out by pulling forward on its tip (at the muzzle of the gun). The nipple is a small metal nub (about ¼ inch high) that the firing cap is set on for the firing pin to strike and ignite the charge when firing. The nipple is set on the tip of the breech plug. You should be able to pull this off, but may need to unscrew it with your muzzleloader’s combo tool.Before you begin cleaning the barrel, run the ramrod down once to make sure that the barrel is unloaded and contains no charge.

, These parts can be completely submerged in bore cleaner oil and left there as you finish cleaning the firearm. Pour approximately a quarter cup of bore cleaner oil into a small, clean bowl, and set the nipple and breach plug inside. The bore cleaner oil will loosen any grime or powder residue that has accumulated on these parts.Take a small cleaning brush (a toothbrush in a pinch) and dampen it with bore cleaner oil. Use this to scrub clean the threads inside the breach that you have unscrewed the breech plug from.
When working with cleaning oils, be careful not to spill them, as they will likely stain your clothing and carpet.

, You’ll need to first dampen a cleaning patch with bore cleaner oil. Once the patch is damp, set it on the end of the ramrod. A cleaning patch is a small piece of cloth which is pushed through the barrel in order to clean out any powder residue. Once you’ve balanced the patch on the tip of the ramrod, push this through the barrel from tip to base.For some muzzleloaders, the ramrod must be assembled before being used to clean the barrel. Do this by screwing together the ramrod handle and extensions, and screwing the ramrod jag (1-inch metal bit that the cleaning patch rests on) into the tip of the rod.

, Once you’ve pushed a cleaning patch with bore cleaner through the barrel, repeat the process, this time using the ramrod to push through a dry cleaning patch. Continue cleaning the barrel with alternately damp and dry cleaning patches. This will keep the barrel from getting too wet from the cleaning oil, while still effectively removing all powder residue., Once the barrel is clean, make sure that the breech plug and nipple are fully dry, and then reinstall them in the barrel. To ensure that these parts resist rust and corrosion, use your finger to apply a small amount of lube paste (for black powder) on the screw threads of the breech plug.Do not apply lube paste directly to the nipple.

, In order to do this, the bolt assembly must be out of the firearm as well. Flip the gun upside down and, using your screwdriver, remove the three screws on the underside of the muzzleloader that hold the action and receiver (parts of the firearm which contain the trigger and firing mechanism). Remove the action.Set the screws to the side, preferably on a flat surface or in a bowl, so they don’t roll away.

, You can dampen a clean cotton cloth with bore cleaner oil and use this to wipe any grime and grit off of the trigger assembly. Focus on cleaning parts of the assembly that move and undergo friction, especially the trigger itself and the safety mechanism.Some firearm manufacturers (such as Remington or Browning) make a pressurized spray oil that can be useful in this situation. A spray oil can be applied directly to the points of friction on the muzzleloader trigger and action.

, You can do this by applying a small amount of lube paste to a clean cotton cloth, and wiping a light layer of it along the exterior of the action, receiver, and trigger assembly, as well as the entirety of the barrel. The lube paste will help these parts resist rust and corrosion.Do not put the lube paste on any of the moving parts of the trigger assembly. The lube paste is much thicker than the light cleaning oil, and may cause problems with the trigger’s function.

, Once the trigger mechanism has been cleaned and lubed, place it back in the stock of the muzzleloader. Reinsert the three screws, and tighten the trigger mechanism firmly in place.Store the muzzleloader in a safe and dry environment—such as a locked closet or gun safe—when the firearm is not in use.

Select the handgun you wish to purchase.,
Try before you buy.,
Make sure you can pass a background check.,
Submit to a background check.",How to Buy a Gun in Wisconsin1," Ask for assistance from a dealer if necessary. When purchasing a handgun, you should take several factors into account, including:


Decide on the intended use for the handgun. A range gun—or a gun primarily used for recreation at the gun range—is different than a concealed carry gun, or personal protection gun, which in turn might be different than a home defense gun.Virtually any handgun can be a range gun, no matter how large or impractical.
Concealed carry guns should be smaller and lighter. Polymer frame guns and small steel frame guns are ideal. But keep in mind that the smaller and lighter the gun, the greater the recoil.Handguns for home defense can be larger than carry guns, because the user doesn’t have to worry about being weighed down throughout the day.Just don’t get anything so large you have to worry about overshooting—passing through wall—and hurting an innocent bystander.;
, For most people, guns are expensive purchases. You’ll want to make sure that you like the way your gun feels and shoots before you commit to it.


Some sporting goods stores and gun dealers have shooting ranges where you can “test drive” a gun you’re looking at.

, Save yourself some potential embarrassment and familiarize yourself with the reasons you wouldn't pass a background check. You will be required to submit to one before you can complete your purchase.


Felons, illegal aliens, persons who admit to being addicted to drugs, servicemen who have received a dishonorable discharge, persons who have renounced their citizenship, persons under restraining orders, persons convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence, those adjudicated mentally ill, and fugitives are all prohibited from purchasing a handgun., Before you can buy a handgun, you’ll have to submit to a background check. The only thing that you’ll need for the background check is a Wisconsin driver’s license or ID.Out of state licenses are not acceptable.


The background check is conducted by the Wisconsin Department of Justice (DOJ), acting as a middleman for the FBI. Typically, a background check will only take minutes, but it can take as long as five business days. An extra $13 charge is added to the purchase of the firearm for conducting the background check.
Wisconsin limits gun sales to those who are 18 years of age or older. While there was at one time a 48 hour waiting period, this was repealed in 2015.

Purchase your gun.",How to Buy a Gun in Wisconsin2," You will require different features from a hunting rifle compared to a range gun, hunting shotgun, or a shotgun for home defense. When you purchase a long gun, take the following factors into account:


Semi-automatic, high-capacity assault rifles are best used at the range. They are too powerful for home defense and they tend to make poorer hunting rifles than a traditional larger caliber hunting rifle.Hunting rifles tend to have smaller capacity, and larger calibers. While there are some semi-automatic and lever action hunting rifles, the majority are bolt-action.Hunting shotguns are typically geared toward fowl hunting, although some people hunt larger game with them. They have a low to medium capacity, and come in double barrel, pump action, and semi-automatic.Home defense shotguns have shorter barrels, and usually come in pump action or semiautomatic., Ask them whether they think your selection is consistent with what you plan on using the weapon for.


As always, remember that they have an incentive to upsell you. Make sure a more expensive recommendation is worth it.

, Although many dealers have ranges on sight, some of the smaller dealers might not allow rifles on their range. If that’s the case, call a few other ranges and see if they have the same gun for rent.

, Unlike handguns, there is no background check required to purchase a long gun. Once you’ve made your decision, make your purchase.You must be of sound mind and not committing any crimes at the time of your purchase.

Pistols (pistols) are great for self-defense. On the other hand, they require a lot of practice and skill to become proficient. They are not good for hunting (if you are hunting something bigger than rabbits). The efficacy drops sharply after 20–30 meters (65.6–98.4 ft), but can be used in well-trained hands 100 meters (328.1 ft), which is the only firearm, which still can be very effective in regard distances.






Rifles can fill many different needs. Hunting (became illegal after the year 2003), target shooting (with an extension: up to 1,000 meters). Bolt action rifles can be cheap, but very accurate. Semi-automatic rifles can be good for the target and home defense use. Automatic rifles can not be bought in Brazil without special permits (authorized by the army).






Shotguns are arguably the most versatile weapon.

In the US, rifles or shotguns may be purchased by anyone over the age of 18, and handguns by anyone over the age of 21, provided they meet the following federal regulations:


The buyer must be a current citizen of the United States or a permanent resident (green card holder).
The buyer must not be under indictment for a crime punishable by a year in prison, or to have been previously convicted of a crime with a similar punishment.
The buyer must not have a current restraining filed by an intimate partner or child, and the buyer must not have been convicted of domestic violence.
The buyer must not be a fugitive, or a user of controlled substances.
The buyer must not be committed currently to a mental institution.;
, State and municipal laws are generally more specific and restricted than federal laws, making it essential that you consult the local guidelines to learn about what you do and do not need to do to make a gun purchase legal.


In the US, no federal license is required to own a gun. Likewise, most states do not require licenses for gun ownership, but most states require a license to carry a weapon concealed on your person, or displayed prominently. Learn about the specific laws in place in each state by clicking here.Few states will require waiting periods, before which you must pay for the firearm fully and submit the necessary paperwork, then wait for a period of a few weeks before being permitted to take your new gun home with you.
In some states, regulations are also in place to check up on safety precautions, ensuring that you also purchase gun locks, own safes, and practice gun safety before you're allowed to purchase a gun legally., In the US, gun retailers need to have a Federal Firearm License (FFL) to sell firearms legally. Every seller of firearms should be willing to provide proof of license, if asked.


Much has been made of the ""gun show loophole,"" through which guns are supposedly sold without the necessary regulations at gun shows, under the table. While sometimes private sellers (meaning non-FFL licensed citizens) are sometimes allowed to sell guns and antiques at gun shows, make your purchase from a licensed FFL dealer and you won't have anything to worry about. Ask about the retailer's licensing status and make sure you fill out the proper paperwork and receive a bill of sale.
However you choose to purchase a gun, make sure every gun you purchase has a registered serial number and a bill of sale.

, When you're buying a gun from a licensed retailer, you'll have to provide more than a handshake and money. Identification and confirmation of the above Federal guidelines regarding firearms will need to be provided. This process will vary from country to country.


In the United States, you'll need to furnish a photo ID and fill out Form 4473. This is used to confirm your status as a citizen who is qualified to own a firearm in the United States. These forms are kept on file at gun stores, to make records easily available to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (BATFE), if necessary. If and when a gun store closes, these forms become the property of BATFE.
From this information, licensed retailers perform background checks, in the event that you're trying to purchase a handgun. Background checks are performed through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), and are required any time you want to purchase a handgun.
Background checks and waiting periods aren't one in the same. In some places, the background check will come back immediately, while in others it may take up to three or four days if the system is bogged down. Eventually, the response should come back ""approved,"" ""disapproved,"" or will come back with a ""delay,"" which means that more investigation is required. This will all need to happen before a waiting period takes effect.

, In some places, it's legal to buy used guns from an individual in the same state, who will not require you to submit to a background check before making the sale, or declare the sale. It is, however, illegal for private sellers to sell to individuals who don’t fit the federal requirements for gun ownership, so know that the lack of oversight in no way excuses you from Federal regulations. Owning a gun will still be illegal if you buy it privately and don’t meet the regulations.


If you purchase a gun privately, you need to document the sale yourself by procuring a bill of sale from the county clerk’s office in your area, and it’s probably a good idea to register the firearm locally. This will ensure that there’s a traceable record of the purchase.
If your locality does not require that your gun be registered, you are not required to do so by federal law. Be sure to check your local and state laws about private party gun sales prior to purchasing a gun from an individual. If you are purchasing via online sale, especially if the gun is from another state, you will probably need to get an FFL dealer involved in the transaction to ensure the sale is legal.

, Guns purchased either new or used need to be stored properly, both to maintain the life of the firearm and to ensure the safety of you and your family. Guns should be stored unloaded, in locked gun cases, and preferably with trigger-locks in place over the triggers.


Most new guns should come with cases, especially handguns which will come with lock-boxes for easy storage. If not, though, you'll need to purchase a case in addition to purchasing the gun. Hard-plastic cases and soft cloth cases are both good for protecting your firearm.
If you've got a big collection of firearms, consider storing them in a gun safe. Some high-end models are temperature-controlled, helping to maintain the life of antiques and keep them safe.

Caliber selection in pistols is a hot source of debate amongst tactics-minded handgun users.,
The most crucial factor in determining what caliber you will choose is how accurate and comfortable you are with any particular caliber.,
Don't completely disregard a .22 if your objective is home defense.,
When making your decision, also keep in mind the cost of ammunition!",How to Choose a Firearm for Personal or Home Defense2," While the general stopping power of a pistol is measurably low compared to almost any long gun, you want to make an informed choice to give you the best advantage.


Smaller calibers, such as .380, 9mm, etc, generally result in a higher bullet velocity, reduced recoil which allows for fast follow-up shots, higher capacity magazines (or smaller framed guns), and higher velocity bullets.






Large calibers, such as the venerable .45 feature slower bullets that have increased overall diameter, allowing for a wider initial wound channel (which gives you a slightly increased chance of hitting something vital). The heavier bullets and generally high muzzle energies increase recoil, resulting in slower follow-up shots and the larger diameter of the cartridges means lower capacity magazines.







, Most U.S. self-defense experts consider .380 ACP (9 x 17 mm Browning Short) or 9mm as the minimum for adequate defense, while European Police believe that .32 ACP (7.65 x 17 mm Browning) as adequate. Making an informed decision about what caliber you will use requires experience. Shoot many different calibers and choose the biggest caliber that you can comfortably shoot and make fast, accurate followup shots with.

, A semi-automatic .22 pistol or Ruger 10/22 carbine with a high-capacity magazine is easy to control when shooting fast and can be very effective at close range (most home-defense shots occur at less than 7 yards), and .22 ammunition is very cheap. Furthermore, a .22 won't penetrate as many walls, thus reducing property damage and risk to your neighbors if you miss.

, You'll want to be able to easily afford enough ammunition to keep up a regular practice routine.

Handguns come in all shapes and sizes.,
For those who are expecting to carry a concealed handgun, a lighter, polymer framed firearm is often preferred over a heavier metal framed firearm because the weight of the firearm can become burdensome over time.,
For home defense, or openly carried handguns, it makes sense to have a larger frame.,
Choosing a mid-sized frame can allow for more versatility, owing to a compromise between weight and size that will allow you to use the handgun in more roles.

",How to Choose a Firearm for Personal or Home Defense3," From derringers that are only two or three inches long, to what are jokingly called ""hand cannons"" that can be 12 or more inches long.

, Heavier belts are available, however, to mitigate the effect of weight. Smaller handguns also aid concealment as they are easier to hide under clothing.

, The longer slide will aid accuracy by increasing the distance between the front and rear sights, and the heavier weight will reduce recoil and allow for faster followup shots.

Pistols represent newer handgun technology than revolvers (though John Browning invented the idea of a slide enclosed barrel around 1900).,
A pistol usually keeps its ammunition in a spring loaded box of metal called a magazine (not a clip as is commonly misunderstood).,
Early pistols were plagued by reliability problems.,
To some degree, a more expensive, name brand handgun may perform more reliably than a very inexpensive one.,
Cost is not the only consideration though; the best gun is the one you actually have with you - it's better to have an inexpensive gun that no gun at all (assuming it's reliable).

,
Pistols have a number of advantages over revolvers:


They are magazine fed, which means that after you have depleted anywhere between 5 and 33 rounds (depending on the model of the handgun, the capacity of the magazine, and applicable state/local laws), you can quickly change magazines and get back into the fight.,
There are also disadvantages to pistols:


Pistols are more difficult to operate safely.",How to Choose a Firearm for Personal or Home Defense4," Many law enforcement and militaries around the world rely on pistols for their sidearms.

, The pistol primes itself for the next shot through the action of a slide - a piece of metal that covers the barrel. The forces of the gasses propelling the bullet from the barrel after it is fired push backwards on the slide, causing it to travel to the rear and pulling/ejecting the spent shell from the gun, at which time a spring compressed by the rearward action pushes the slide forward, which causes the slide to catch the rear of another cartridge from the magazine, pushing it into the barrel.

, In the past 50 years, however, the reliability of semi-automatic handguns has improved markedly as compared to revolvers.

, While you don't have to spend thousands of dollars, expect to pay at least $400US for a brand new semi-automatic handgun with a reasonable level of quality.

,, (Note that this only holds true for as many magazines as you have pre-loaded with ammunition. Reloading a magazine under stress with loose rounds can take a painfully long amount of time, or be nearly impossible to complete due to the decreased motor skills caused by the effects of large amounts of adrenaline.)






The force required to operate the slide on the firearm makes them much more desirable for multiple-shot encounters as the slide's action dampens the recoil to some degree. This allows for faster and more accurate follow-up shots. The rearward action of the slide as it ejects the spent casing reduces the overall recoil from firing the round due to its action reducing the energy created by accelerating the bullet down the barrel.







, Clearing the handgun (removing the ammunition to make it ""safe"") takes more steps and discipline than a revolver.






The mechanical operation of pistols is more complex than that of revolvers, creating more opportunities for the failure of one or more components to disable the pistol. As you might imagine, stoppages of this nature in a life-threatening situation can be very problematic. In the case where a cartridge fails to feed properly into the chamber, a pistol is rendered inoperable until the stoppage is cleared, whereas with a revolver, pulling the trigger again when a cartridge fails to fire will rotate the cylinder, bringing a new cartridge into line with the firing pin. This drawback to a pistol requires extra training and practice ensure the steps to clear the stoppage and return the firearm to working order can be performed instinctually.






The multiple moving parts of a pistol means that in general, they are chambered for less powerful calibers than Revolvers.







"
"
Revolvers have been a popular firearm choice since they were invented.,
Revolvers allow you to fire between four and eight rounds in succession without reloading.,
The advantages to choosing a revolver:


Reliability is the most attractive feature of a revolver.,
Disadvantages to revolvers include:


Reloading a revolver is a very dexterous operation and it may take some time.",How to Choose a Firearm for Personal or Home Defense5," Their ultra-simple mechanics make them very easy to manufacture, and their basic design has been around for centuries.

, Ammunition is stored in a round piece of metal called a ""cylinder"", which rotates when the hammer is cocked or the trigger is pulled (depending on the ""action"" of the revolver). If a round fails to fire, simply cocking the hammer or pulling the trigger again (depending on the capabilities of the revolver) will rotate the cylinder for a new cartridge.

, A standard shooter would have a hard time making a spurless (hammerless), double-action revolver not shoot when the trigger is pulled. The design is simple, and the use is even simpler: pick up a loaded gun, disengage the safety (if applicable), and pull the trigger, and it will fire.






Simpler operation means that a new shooter is more easily able to unload a revolver. Removing all of the ammunition from the cylinder quickly unloads the gun.






Revolvers also generally are chambered in more powerful calibers than their semi-automatic counterparts. .357 Magnum and .44 Magnum revolvers are extremely popular and pack a great deal of energy when fired.







, Even speed loaders require practice and still are not as fast as changing out a preloaded magazine as you can do with a pistol.






Cylinders often can not hold nearly as many cartridges as pistol magazines, meaning one must reload more often in the rare event of a prolonged firefight. One should note, however, that most self-defense encounters require less than four or five shots.






Although they may be more ""reliable"" they are by no means more rugged. The mechanism for DA revolvers require clockwork precision. As pointed out by renowned firearms trainer Massad Ayoob, auto-pistols are superior in dealing with grit and grime (such as chunks of gore etc.)







"
"
Handguns take skill and practice to use.,
For first time handgun owners, revolvers are probably the better choice as they are simpler.,
For more experienced users, or users willing to take a formal instruction, a semi-automatic handgun may make more sense due to their increased capacity and easier follow-up shots.,
Every person is different.,
When hunting, a larger caliber may be required as many dangerous game have tough skin and muscles the need the extra energy to penetrate through skin and muscle to reach vital organs.",How to Choose a Firearm for Personal or Home Defense6," If you are not willing to devote time and effort to learn the skills, don't endanger others by trying to use one under stress. Handgun marksmanship is considered a sport because it takes training and skill.

, Typically they hold 5-6 rounds which is enough so that you will not have to reload during most home defense incidents.

, Operation takes a bit more learning and practice, but the positives are why the majority of law enforcement and military personnel carry semi-automatic handguns.

, A firearm that ""fits"" my hand perfectly will not feel right to you. Most firearm owners are happy to allow a novice to try a couple of shots. Do your research, test fire a few weapons before you invest.

, Many lower-power cartridges may not penetrate deeply enough to cause incapacitating damage.

Buy a rifle for hunting small game and target shooting.,
Select a caliber based on your needs.,
Select an appropriate loading action for your purposes.,
Consider investing in a scope.",How to Buy a Gun2," Rifles, sometimes called ""long guns,"" are most commonly used for hunting purposes and sport shooting, and make excellent guns for beginners. Rifles are the most accurate style of gun, due to the ""rifling"" spiral of the barrel, which is long enough to result in very accurate shots. Modern rifles are accurate and effective for very long distances, depending on the style of rifle and the caliber of the ammunition used. Whatever your reasoning for wanting a gun, a rifle is a smart purchase.

, The caliber of a rifle refers to the size of the diameter of the barrel, and the corresponding ammunition used in the gun. While there will be a variety of different ammunition styles within a given caliber, the caliber itself will tell you much about the shooting power of the gun. Most rifles owned by are either .22 or .30 caliber.


.22 is the most common caliber of rifle sold for beginners. It's a relatively small caliber, with low recoil and high accuracy, but still powerful enough to use for hunting small game. If you want to hunt deer or larger game, a larger caliber (.30) is more appropriate for the gun to be humane and effective.

, The style of rifles varies mostly in regard to how the rifle is loaded and how ammunition is advanced into the chamber to be fired. Partly aesthetic and partly practical, the choice is ultimately up to you. There's no ""correct"" choice.


Bolt-action rifles require you to retract a side-mounted bolt to eject each spent cartridge, and then advance a new cartridge into the chamber by racking it back forward.
Semi-automatic rifles use the force of each shot to expel the spent shell and advance a fresh shell into the chamber without the need of doing anything manually. Each time you pull the trigger, the gun should fire until the magazine is empty.
Hybrid models, repeating rifles, lever action rifles, and many other varieties are also available, if slightly less common than the standard bolt-action and semi-auto. Shop around and try out more obscure guns to suit your purposes.

, A rifle is only as good as your ability to aim it accurately. Depending on why you want the rifle, you might find it appropriate to invest in an additional telescopic rifle scopes which you can mount on top of your rifle and drastically improve the accuracy of the gun.

Buy a shotgun for hunting birds and sport shooting.,
Match the gauge to your power needs.,
Select an action.,
Consider adding a choke.",How to Buy a Gun3," Shotguns are also long guns, which look much similar to rifles, but feature a lot more recoil and fire a different type of ammunition. While rifles shoot bullets, shotguns shoot plastic shells that are loaded with shot, tiny pellets that expel from the shell in scattered pattern. Shotguns are used for hunting birds, particularly duck, pheasant, and geese, as well as for shooting skeet and other types of sport shooting and home defense.

, Like the caliber, the gauge of the shotgun refers to the diameter of the shell that will be used. You must only use ammunition of the corresponding gauge in a shotgun. The lower the number in the gauge, the more powerful the shot.


12 gauge shotguns are the most common variety of shotgun, but are somewhat more powerful than what most people might need or want out of a gun. A 20 gauge might be considered a medium-gauge, while a 410 is a light gauge common for young hunters and beginners who're more interesting in shooting for sport or varmint control.
There are lots of other considerations when it comes to choosing shotgun shells, including the length of the shell and the ""shot count"" per shell. Shotguns offer a lot of versatility with each style of gun.

, Shotguns come in a wide variety of styles, single-barrel shotguns, double-barrel shotguns, oriented either side-by-side or over-and-under. The biggest difference in how you'll actually use a shotgun, however, has to do with the action. Like a rifle must be reloaded in a number of ways, so must a shotgun. Most shotguns are either pump-action or break-action.


Pump-action shotguns are iconic on account of the barrel-mounted slide, which advances a shell into the chamber and expels the spent shell when racked by sliding it backward and then forward. Common in movies, these shotguns are reliable and extremely popular. Pump action shotguns can hold between two and twelve shells in the gun at once, depending on the model.
Break-action shotguns are reloaded by releasing a spring-mounted hinge that allows the barrel to partially separate from the stock and eject the spent shells. To reload, the shooter simply places a new shell in manually. Most double-barrel shotguns will be break-action.
Semi-automatic shotguns reload in the same way that a rifle does, automatically expelling the spent shell and chambering the new. The difference between a semi-auto and a straight-automatic is that the semi-auto requires you to pull the trigger every time you want to shoot, while an automatic would continually fire if you held it down.

, Choke tubes are roughly four inches long, but can make a world of difference when it comes to the efficacy of your shotgun. Chokes come in a variety of sizes, some more ""open"" and some more ""tight."" The choke affects the spread of the shot pellets when each shell is fired, meaning that some chokes can allow you to keep a tighter and correspondingly more powerful configuration of shot, while others will allow it to spread out to a wider area, meaning you'll be more likely to hit your target.

Buy a handgun for target shooting and home defense.,
Be prepared to submit to a background check.,
Match the caliber to your purposes.,
Decide between a semi-automatic pistol and a revolver.,
Hold the gun before you buy it.,
If your state requires a permit, don't carry your weapon until you've received it.",How to Buy a Gun4," Handguns are compact and high-impact, popular for both target and trick shooting, as well as personal and home defense purposes. Handguns might be the most controversial of all the varieties of guns, short of automatic weapons, and also some of the most regulated. Knowing a bit about the basics of handgun ownership will help you to make the most informed choice., All handgun-buyers must submit to a background check before being permitted to buy a handgun. The same information will be provided as when you purchase any FFL firearm, but there will also likely be a waiting period and a more thorough background check completed into your record.

, Handguns come in a wide variety of calibers, just as rifles do, and are measured in the same way. The caliber of the gun refers to the diameter of the barrel and the corresponding ammunition that will be used. Depending on why you want to purchase a handgun and what you intent to use it for, the caliber of the handgun is an important consideration.


.40 caliber and 9mm pistols are extremely common in law enforcement and as conceal and carry weapons. For many gun-owners, guns with a lower caliber than this are ineffective for use in home defense..38-.44 caliber pistols and above are typically used for home defense purposes. The recoil and the power of these guns is quite large, making it somewhat excessive for those interested in guns for conceal and carry or sport purposes.

, Both kinds of handguns are iconic pistols in Hollywood. Cowboy shooter like Dirty Harry or a semi-auto like James Bond? Whether you want to spin the chamber or rack the slide, you can get a reliable gun.


Semi-auto pistols are magazine-loaded, the chamber fed by pre-loaded magazines that hold between 9 and 12 shots. To fire semi-automatic pistols, the slide on top of the gun needs to be pulled back to advance a bullet into the chamber and depress the hammer.
Revolvers hold between 5 and 9 shells and advance by rotating in a clockwise motion, advancing through the chambers. To remove the spent shells, the revolving chamber is rotated to the side and the shells are emptied manually. The hammer is likewise pulled back manually on a revolver.

, Handguns need to be matched to your body style and your strength a lot more than most other varieties of gun. It's important to hold a gun first and make sure it feels comfortable in your hands before making a purchase. Ideally, you should be able to fire the weapon a few times to make an informed choice. For this reason, gun ranges are typically the best places to try out guns in a safe and supervised environment.

It has been said, ""Pack a handgun for the unexpected, but if you know you'll be in a gunfight, always grab a bigger gun!"",
The main advantages of long guns are power and accuracy.",How to Choose a Firearm for Personal or Home Defense7," Handguns lack power. A high-end .44 Magnum pistol will produce about 1,000 ft/lb of muzzle energy; a traditional ""varmint"" caliber, the .223, will produce about 50% more energy, and high-end rifles produce over 10,000 ft/lb!

, With a bit of practice, a decent shooter can hit a man sized target at greater than 300 yards (274.3 m) with the proper rifle, due to the more powerful round, longer barrel and the longer sight-base (the distance between the front and rear sights).

"
"
Shotguns can have either smooth or rifled bores.,
The advantages of a shotgun:


The biggest benefit of shotguns is their ability to shoot shot (and just about anything else).,
There are some disadvantages as well:


Although a shotgun firing shot will produce a spread much larger than a solid projectile, it does not preclude the need to aim.",How to Choose a Firearm for Personal or Home Defense8," They are used to fire large caliber ""shells"" that contain either shot (a multiple quantity of metal pellets) or a single large slug.

, The spreading out of the shot when fired allows a larger area to be hit with each trigger pull, reducing the requirement for precision shooting, and, depending on the type of ammunition and range, can cause greater damage than a single bullet from a handgun.






Some shotguns have the flexibility of shooting shot or bullet-type projectiles (known as ""slugs""). This allows them to have the characteristics of rifles but also the option to use shot depending on the situation.






Shotguns, like many long guns, are also customizable and versatile. Most modern shotguns can be outfitted with different length barrels, stocks, fore ends, sights and many other accessories to fit your needs.






The use of chokes, a narrowing ""funnel""-like section at the end of the barrel, allows you to control how much the shot disperses out of the end of the barrel. Some shotguns have threading or another method at the end of the barrel to allow you to easily change a choke depending on your needs. For defensive use, cylinder bore (or basically no choke at all) and sometimes improved cylinder (IC) chokes are most common. These allow the shot to spread out quickly and increase the chance of hitting your target. However, at longer ranges (greater than 20yds or so) the shot spreads out too much and will not be able to guarantee a good hit.






Another benefit of shooting shot from a shotgun is the inherent lack of penetration. For home protection, lighter shot will likely become less than lethal once it goes through a wall, protecting innocent family members or neighbors. Typically, the penetration is proportional to the size of the shot (for example, large buckshot is still capable of substantial penetration.) Although the ""best"" size is a hotly debated topic, smaller bird shot and skeet/clay target sized shot at close range can be very effective.
Shotgun barrels range in length from 18.5 inch (47.0 cm) ""home defense"" barrels to 24 inch (61.0 cm) hunting barrels. Also, many shotguns are made so the barrel can be changed easily. This way, you can put a short barrel on for home defense, and a long barrel for hunting or busting clays. Don't forget to practice with your short barrel, though.







, At normal household room distances, the shot spread, even with no choke, is barely the size of a softball.






Unless you are using slugs, shotguns are useless at longer ranges. Between the spreading of the shot, and the light weight of the pellets, the power of the weapon drops off precipitously as range increases. That said, most self defense encounters happen well within range of a shotgun.






Shotguns with heavy loads, such as 00 buck, can kick pretty hard, making them potentially difficult to control without practice.







"
"
Rifles are what most people envision when they think of a long gun.,
Rifles have a smaller cousin called a ""carbine"".,
Rifle advantages:


Unlike pistol bullets, which typically create narrow permanent wound channels, the greatly increased speed of rifle bullets create a shock wave that can permanently destroy large amounts of tissue, greatly increasing your chances of stopping the threat with a single reasonably placed shot.,
The disadvantages of a rifle:


As with any long gun, maneuverability is greatly reduced due to its overall length.",How to Choose a Firearm for Personal or Home Defense9," Rifles are designed to fire a single projectile, often smaller than most pistol bullets, at a much higher rate of speed.

, Carbines are usually lighter in weight, and are shorter barreled (and stocked) than full blown rifles. They often fire the same cartridges, however due to their length they are often chambered in smaller, less powerful calibers.

,






Rifle cartridges are far more powerful than handgun cartridges. This greater power means you can shoot effectively at a much longer distance.






Rifles still require a good deal of precision, but the dexterity needed for a pistol is not necessary, and stopping power is much improved.







, Home defense situations may require you to place the stock below your shoulder, reducing your accuracy. Movement around corners and through doors may be hampered by your barrel preceding you through the door, warning an enemy that you're there.






Rifles are also more capable of ""over penetration"". This is where the bullet passes through an object, such as a wall, or your intended target and continue on with enough force to injure or kill. Over penetration can be mitigated through proper ammunition choice, but is always a serious consideration with rifles.






Rifle ammunition is much more expensive than handgun ammunition. This can mean that it is more expensive to practice with your rifle, and reduce the amount of training and practice you can afford.






The overall length of rifles also means that they are slower to aim than a handgun due to their weight. Compared to a pistol, swinging a rifle around to engage a threat can take longer, and in a self defense situation, lost time can be deadly.







"
"Carrying a long gun is more difficult, due to its size and weight, but the greater velocity and power of the bullets delivers much better results with a hit than a handgun.,
That said, for defense within the home, the shotgun is generally recognized by many to be a superior choice due to the close ranges and reduced likelihood of over penetration.",How to Choose a Firearm for Personal or Home Defense10,", The sound of a shotgun being racked delivers the universal message that says ""wrong house, go away""."

Snap a photo and perform a quick Internet search.,
Cut a portion of the plant and bring it to a local home and garden store for evaluation.,
Contact poison control or the animal poison control center.,
Inquire about the toxicity level before purchasing a plant.,
Ask the property owner about the plants in the yard before purchasing a home.",How to Determine if a Plant Is Poisonous to Your Child or Pet," One of the easiest ways to get more information about your plant is to take a photo of it and then use it for reference when performing your search--especially if you don’t know the plant’s name.


Search using the plant’s name. If you are lucky enough to know the name of the plant your search should be relatively simple. Include keywords such as “toxic” in addition to the plant name in your search to determine if the plant posses any danger.
Refer to your photo when scanning for images of the plant. If you are unsure what kind of plant you have, use the image to get you to the right place. Search images first and then, when you find a match click on the image to obtain the name. Once you have the plant’s name use the name and the keyword, “toxic” to determine if the plant is dangerous.
Consider photographing your entire yard to know exactly what kind of plants you have. In an emergency situation you want to know if a specific plant will have put your child or pet in harm’s way. However, once the emergency has passed, make sure none of your plants are poisonous by searching for each plant.;
, Sometimes a physician or vet will not know if the plant is dangerous just by looking at it, but a plant expert should.


Gather not only the leaves, but any seeds, berries or flowering pieces for evaluation. In some cases the plant expert will need to know if the plant is male or female in order to determine the toxicity level.
Inquire about the level of toxicity. Even if the plant is considered to be “toxic” the only impact may be redness or itchy skin. However, other plants can cause liver or kidney failure and possibly death so find out how dangerous the plant is when you talk to the expert.
Ask about the expert’s experience with the plant. Has he/she known anyone who was poisoned by this plant and what did they do? Of course going directly to the emergency room or vet is imperative; but some plant experts may have insight into other types of treatment that may counteract the plant’s toxicity--information you may want to share with your physician or vet.

, Not only will you receive information regarding whether your child or pet ingested a poisonous substance, the technician will advise you on proper ways to handle the poisoning.


Describe the plant or use the name when explaining what happened. You may be shaky and upset, but it’s important that you deliver all the pertinent information to the technician as quickly and clearly as possible.
Recall when you noticed your child or pet consumed the plant (i.e. he/she vomited or regurgitated some of the leaves or seeds) and how much material was produced. The technician will need to know how much of the plant or its seeds were eaten.
Explain what you’ve already done to remedy the situation. Did you already induce vomiting or administer charcoal? In some cases it’s not advisable to induce vomiting so if you have, it’s important to let the technician know.
Ask if you should call the emergency services or if you have enough time to drive your child to the hospital. A call to emergency services may already have been placed if the technician believes your child is in imminent danger, however ask about the next step. If your pet has eaten dangerous seeds or plants and it’s after normal vet hours, inquire about an emergency veterinary hospital near you. Many ER vets are open 24/7, which may be key to your pet’s survival.

, Avoid having to worry about your child or dog being poisoned by a plant and ask your home and garden expert to rate the plant’s toxicity level before you purchase a certain plant.


Ask about the plant’s flowers or seeds in addition to leaf toxins. In some cases, certain plants flower or produce seeds every few years or during certain seasons. Also, find out when the seeds or flowers will bloom and how often.
Consider only purchasing non-toxic plants. Some people believe that their children or pets simply wouldn’t consider eating a plant, however why create a possible risk only for a pretty plant. Ask your gardener to suggest a non-toxic plant that has the same appearance and durability but without the danger.

, In order to avoid an emergency situation, ask for a list of plants already growing in the yard of a home you may want to purchase. Homeowners hire a home inspector to determine it the structure is sound so consider contracting with a plant expert to make sure your yard is safe.


Inquire at your local home and garden store if a plant expert is available to assess the property. For a nominal fee many garden stores have an in-house local plant expert who can take a quick tour of the property to identify any hazardous plants.
Write into the contract that all toxic or dangerous plants must be removed before you will purchase the house. Especially if you have young children or dogs, trying to remove plants while simultaneously moving into the home may not be a priority. Problems could occur if your child or dog nibbles on a toxic plant during the move or when you are preoccupied with unpacking, which could result in a tragedy.

Do your research first.,

Studying a map of the area where you're going -- and making sure to bring it with you -- will increase your chances of not getting lost tremendously. Educate yourself about the flora and fauna of the area you are exploring. Knowledge of the local plants and animals can save your life (for example knowing which plants are edible or knowing where the local colony of rattlesnakes make haven).


One of the most accurate and informative books about this subject is ""Bushcraft - Outdoor Skills and Wilderness Survival"" by Mors Kochanski.;
, Don't make the mistake that James Franco makes in 127, the survival movie based on a true story -- make sure someone knows exactly where you're going and when. That way, if you do not return in time, someone will realize that you are lost, quickly alert rescuers, and be able to tell them where to start looking for you.

, Basic survival tools such as a knife, a fire steel (metal match), some matches (in a waterproof canister), some cord (550 paracord is best), a whistle, a space blanket, a signaling mirror, water purifying tablets, and a compass can mean the difference between life and death. Even if you are only out on a day hike, be sure to bring the essentials.


Having all this equipment is nothing if you cannot use it properly. Make sure to practice many times in a safe environment before venturing into the wilderness.
Don't forget to bring a first aid kit. You should bring band aids, antiseptic, and tweezers for removing splinters that could get infected.
If you need any medication or injections, bring them along – even if you don’t plan to be gone for long enough to need them. You never know when you might accidentally step on a snake and get bitten.
A compass is also an item of critical importance when traveling in the woods. You can point your compass in the direction of the city or wherever you are embarking from, and remember the direction the compass's pointer points in. That way, if you're lost in the woods, all you have to do is turn around until the compass points in the correct direction, and then follow your way back.
Before you leave, learn how to use a compass. If you have a map and can spot a few prominent landscapes, you can actually use the compass to triangulate your position and, from there, figure out where you need to go.
When choosing a space blanket (a light, thin sheet of extremely reflective Mylar), spend a little extra to buy a larger, more durable model. A space blanket can be used to block wind and water, wrapped around the body prevent/counteract hypothermia, or even placed behind you to reflect a fire’s heat onto your back, but none of this is useful if the blanket is too small or tears the moment you unwrap it.

, A cell phone with a spare battery or a portable CB radio can be your best, quickest means of rescue if you are truly lost or injured. A cell signal may only be obtainable only from a hill or tree, but is better than nothing. Serious hikers may even consider investing in a personal locator beacon such as the SPOT Messenger for extended, precarious, or very remote, treks.


A SPOT Messenger is a satellite communication devices that allows you to contact emergency services, reach your own personal contacts for help during non-emergencies, or even simply check in with your friends and family as you trek so that they know you’re alright. A service subscription is required and is not cheap.

, Panic is more dangerous than almost anything else, because it interferes with the operation of your single best, most useful and versatile survival tool: your mind. The moment you realize that you are lost, before you do anything else, stop. Take a deep breath and stay calm. Before you act, follow the tenets of the acronym STOP:


S = sit down
T = think
O = observe your surroundings
P = prepare for survival by gathering materials

, Wherever you are will become your ""point zero."" Find a way to mark it using a spare piece of clothing, a pile of rocks, a sheet of paper, or anything else easily visible from a distance. Learn your basic directions -- the sun rises in the East and sets in the West. Use this to tell directions as on a compass (in a clockwise direction starting at the top 12:00) North, East, South, West.


For example, if it is late afternoon and the sun is on your right you must be facing South.
Learning how to spot the North Star at night in your backyard beforehand will also prove invaluable.

, This not only increases your chances of being found, but also reduces the energy your body expends and the amount of water and food you will need. Hunker down and stay put. Chances are that someone will be looking for you, especially if you let someone know your plans. Also, if you're with someone else, do not separate. Having strength in numbers will help you survive.


Also seeking nearby shade if it is hot out which greatly decreases your risk of dehydration and sunburn. Don't be tempted to remove clothing as this only increases these risks.

, Build a good-sized fire with sufficient coals to stay hot for many hours, and make sure that you have plenty of extra dry wood. Start the fire before you think you need it, even if the weather is warm; fires are easier to make under easy conditions than in a panic as the sun sets – to say nothing of the fact that having a fire nearby will give you a sense of comfort and safety as you get your bearings.


A good rule of thumb is to gather wood until you think you have enough to last the night, then gather three more piles of the same size, after which you might have enough to get through the night.
You should have access to dry wood in the understory of the forest. You can also use bark or dried dung. If you build a fire that is hot enough, you can also burn green wood, brush, or tree boughs to make a signaling fire that creates a lot of smoke.
The best wood for maintaining a fire is dead wood that you pull off a standing tree. Regardless of what type of woods you are in, there will certainly be some dry wood available.
Remember that a small fire is easier to keep burning than a big fire, though, because it requires less fuel. Once you have sufficient embers, keep the fire to a manageable size so you don't spend too much time looking for fuel.
Don't build a fire in an area where it is unsafe to do so. Your fire should be well away from flammable trees and brush, preferably in a clearing. Be careful with your fire. While you want to feed it, you shouldn't overdo it. Consider the weather and other factors and remember, a forest fire is a lot harder to survive than just being lost!

, Make noise by whistling, shouting, singing, or banging rocks together. If you can, mark your location in such a way that it's visible from the air. If you're in a mountain meadow, make three piles of dark leaves or branches in a triangle. In sandy areas, make a large triangle in the sand. Three of anything in the wilderness is a standard distress signal.


You can use the fire to send a distress signal. The universal distress signal is created by three fires in a straight line, or three fires that form a triangle.
You can also blow a whistle three times shoot three shots of a rifle in the air, if you have one, or shine a mirror that catches the light three times.

, Though you shouldn't move around too much, you should explore your immediate surrounds to find anything useful. You could find things someone left there before, be it a tin can or small lighter, it can be helpful significantly. Be sure you can always find your way back to your ""point zero"" as you search for water, shelter, or your way home.

, In a survival situation, you can last up to three days without water, but by the end of the second day you're not going to be in very good shape; find water before then. The best source of water is a spring, but the chances of finding them are slim. You should also look out for nearby birds, because they like to fly around fresh water. Drink your remaining water -- you should ration it, but not so much that you're thirsty right away.


A running stream is your next best bet; the movement of the water reduces sediment. Be advised that drinking water from streams can lead to some sicknesses, but when you're in a life-or-death situation, the risk of illness is a secondary consideration and anything you may get can be treated when you return.
If there’s dew and you’re desperate, you can gather it in your clothes and then suck the moisture out of the fabric.
You may also be able to find water in the crevices of a rock.

, A crude method of water purification is to take your handy pot and heat the water. For this to effectively kill bacteria, it must be at a rolling boil for at least three minutes.You can also put (clear) water in a clear plastic bottle and set it in the sun for six hours to kill most of the organisms.However, if the water is so full of sediment that the sun can’t penetrate it, this method will not work. If you have any, add a pinch of salt to the water to try to bring the sediment to the bottom.

, Without adequate shelter, you will be fully exposed to the elements and will risk hypothermia or heatstroke, depending on the weather. If you are not properly dressed for the conditions, finding shelter is all the more important. Luckily, the woods are filled with tools and resources to make both shelters and fires (for warmth, safety, and signaling purposes). Here are some things you can use:


Look for a fallen or leaning tree. You can build an A-frame shelter by by stacking branches along both sides a fallen tree, then over the branches with brush, palm fronds, leaves, or other plants.
Use brush or green branches (boughs) from trees to repel water, block wind, keep out snow, or create shade. Close in your shelter on as many sides as possible.
Caves can be great, but be sure the cave is not already occupied by bears, large cats, snakes or other unfriendly animals; they know caves are good too, and they've been looking for good shelter for longer than you have.
If there’s snow, build a snow cave. Snow is a superb insulator and will keep you very cozy.
Just make sure that your shelter is not so hidden that you spend all your time in it and prevent anyone from finding you.
Don't exert too much energy in building the perfect shelter or you'll exhaust yourself.
Make sure you focus more on a ""bed"" than a shelter! It isn't a luxury, it's a necessity. The bed will protect you from the ground, which saps body heat and can cause hypothermia in a lot of cases. Plus, if you aren't well rested, you won't be at your best for other survival. It's better to sleep under the stars in a bed, than to sleep in the total darkness and freeze to death. Ideally you have both, though. Piles of leaves are good ""bedding"".

, Know that most healthy adults can survive up to three weeks without food unless it's cold.It's better to be hungry and healthy than ill. Make sure that you know food is safe before eating it. If there is anything that will lessen your ability to survive, it is being both lost and deathly ill. Starvation won't be a big problem.


Don't be afraid to eat insects and other bugs. While it may be disgusting to eat a few grasshoppers, they do provide useful nutrition. All insects should be cooked as they can harbor parasites that can kill you. Do not eat any caterpillars, brightly colored insects, or any insect that can bite or sting you. Remove the legs, head and wings of any insect before eating.
If you are near water, fish are a good choice. Minnows can be eaten whole.
Avoid eating any mushrooms or berries you see, no matter how hungry you are. It's better to be hungry than to eat something poisonous. Many berries in the forest, especially white berries, are poisonous.

Look for ripples.,
Test the ground in front of you with your walking stick.",How to Get out of Quicksand," If you step into quicksand and you're wearing a backpack or carrying something heavy, immediately take off your backpack or drop what you're carrying. Because your body is less dense than quicksand, you can't fully sink unless you panic and struggle too much or you're weighed down by something heavy.


If it's possible to get out of your shoes, do so. Shoes, especially those with flat, inflexible soles (many boots, for example) create suction as you try to pull them out of quicksand. If you know ahead of time that you are highly likely to encounter quicksand, change out of your boots and either go barefoot or wear shoes that you can pull your feet out of easily.;
, If you feel your feet getting stuck, take a quick couple of steps backward before the quicksand takes hold. It usually takes a minute for the mix to liquify, which means the best method of getting yourself unstuck is to not get stuck in the first place.


If your feet do become stuck, avoid taking big lumbering steps to try to get yourself out. Taking a big step forward might unstick one foot, but push your other farther down, making it extremely difficult to completely unstick yourself.

, Sit down and lean back if your feet are stuck fast. Creating a larger ""footprint"" should free your feet by removing the pressure they create, allowing them to float. When you feel them start to come free, roll to your side away from the quicksand and free of its grip. You'll get dirty, but its the quickest and safest way to free yourself., If you're stuck in quicksand, frantic movements will only hurt your cause. Whatever you do, do it slowly. Slow movements will prevent you from agitating the quicksand; vibrations caused by rapid movements can turn otherwise relatively firm ground into more quicksand.


More importantly, quicksand can react unpredictably to your movements. If you move slowly, you can more easily stop an adverse reaction and, by doing so, avoid getting yourself stuck deeper. You're going to need to be patient. Depending on how much quicksand is around you, it could take several minutes or even hours to slowly, methodically get yourself out.

, Quicksand usually isn't more than a couple feet deep, but if you do happen to come across a particularly deep spot, you could very well sink quite quickly down to your waist or chest. If you panic you can sink further, but if you relax, your body's buoyancy will cause you to float.


Breathe deeply. Not only will deep breathing help you remain calm, it will also make you more buoyant. Keep as much air in your lungs as possible. It is impossible to ""go under"" if your lungs are full of air.

, If you sink up to your hips or higher, bend backward. The more you spread out your weight, the harder it will be to sink. Float on your back while you slowly and carefully extricate your legs. Once your legs are free you can inch yourself to safety by using your arms to slowly and smoothly propel yourself backward with your arms in a sweeping motion, as if you were swimming. When you get near the edge of the quicksand, you can roll to hard ground.

, Carry a walking stick any time you're in quicksand country. As soon as you feel your ankles sink, lay the pole on the surface of the quicksand horizontally behind you. Flop onto your back on top of the pole. After a minute or two, you will achieve balance in the quicksand, and you'll stop sinking. Work the pole towards a new position; move it under your hips. The pole will prevent your hips from sinking, so you can slowly pull one leg free, then the other.


Stay flat on your back with your arms and legs fully touching the quicksand and use the pole as a guide. Inch sideways along the pole to firm ground.

, The work of extracting yourself can be exhausting, so you need to work judiciously, conserving your energy before you become too tired.


You do need to move quickly, however, as the pressure of the sand can shut off your blood flow and cause nerve damage, numbing your legs and making it almost impossible to free yourself without help.
Contrary to popular movies and television, most quicksand-related fatalities do not occur because you become sucked under, but from exposure or drowning in incoming tides., While quicksand is not a unique kind of soil, it can form anywhere groundwater mixes with sandy soil, creating a distinctive soupy mixture. Learning to anticipate places you might encounter quicksand is the best way to avoid becoming entangled in it.Quicksand most commonly occurs in:


Tidal flats
Swamps and marshes
Near lake shores
Near underground springs

, Be on the lookout for ground that appears unstable and wet, or sand that has unnatural looking ""ripples"" in the texture. You should be able to see water seeping up from below the sand, making quicksand quite visible if you're on the lookout as you're hiking around.

, Always bring a hefty walking stick, both to use in case you become stuck, but also to tap the ground in front of you as you walk. A few seconds with a walking stick could be the difference between a messy wrestling match with a pool of quicksand and a safe hike.

Repeat signaling once rescuers are clearly in your vicinity.",How to Attract Attention when You Need Rescuing," Body signals can be used when you have no other resources at hand to signal with and where you're still in good condition to move around, etc. It's fairly straightforward, as follows:


Be sure to perform this when you see rescue craft or rescuers.
Stand upright and wave your arms to the side and down. Pause and repeat. Keep doing until you believe you're spotted.
Raise your arms into the air above your head if you want to be picked up.
Squat down with your arms forward indicating a landing spot for a rescue aircraft.
Hold arms straight out to indicate that you need mechanical assistance.
Lie down to indicate the need for a doctor.
Accompany this with noise if appropriate but don't tire yourself unnecessarily.;
, A large message written on the ground can be spotted by a pilot or other rescuers flying overhead. Another benefit to this method is that you can conserve energy once it is made, as well as leaving an area to search around while the message still works for you.


Find a clear patch of ground. It should be as level as possible.
Clear the area of any objects that might interfere with the message, such as rocks, branches, etc.
Make the message. If it's sand, use a large branch to draw in the sand. If it's land, use rocks, branches, or other items that can be gathered to make letters.
Ensure that the message is large. An easy and recognizable sign is to write SOS. If you know ground-to-air signs for needing a doctor, medical equipment, or food and water, use these as well.

, If you have a mirror, you can use it to create a flash. This can signal a long way and can be especially effective from a high location such as a mountain.


Hold the mirror at eye level. Point the mirror toward the sun to catch the rays.
Choose the target you want the flash to signal to.
Hold your free arm out at full length. Place the free hand between the mirror and the intended target. Face your palm toward you and hold your fingers slightly apart to enable you to catch sight of the target through these parted fingers.
Tilt the mirror until the reflected light hits a point of your hand through which you are able to see the target.
Lower your hand. While keeping the mirror still, look for the light flashing right at the target.

, Flares can only be used once, so their use needs to be very certain. The colored smoke can be seen for a very long distance and is instantly recognizable as a distress signal, day or night. They are good for being lost or stranded at sea, lost in back countries or up mountains, and in desert environments.


Ensure that the flare is dry.
Remove the flare from its container. Reseal any other flares back in the container before lighting the new one; you don't want to accidentally set them all off at once and lose the lot. Also ensure that there are no naked flames near where you are standing.
Read the accompanying instructions with care. Light as explained in its instructions.
Point the flare away from you. Point it up into the sky. It should never be anywhere near your or any other person's face.
Hold the flare at arm's length while it is flaring.

, Morse code is useful because it is an internationally recognized signaling system.


Read How to use Morse code to signal for help for more instructions.

, Make it clear where a rescue helicopter or plane can land, if relevant.


Stand clear of obstacles that could prevent rescuers from landing, or reaching you by boat, foot, car, etc. If rescuers can hear you, warn of obstacles or dangers by voice.

Grab an object on your way down.,
Try to break your fall into parts.,
Relax your body.,
Bend your knees.,
Land feet-first.,
Try to fall to the side.,
Protect your head for when you bounce.,
Get medical help immediately.",How to Survive a Long Fall1," If you can manage to grab a large object, such as a plank or a piece of rafter, you'll greatly increase your chances of survival. The object will absorb some of the impact when you land, taking a little stress off of your bones., If you're falling next to a building, or off a cliff in the wilderness, do your best to break your fall into segments by hitting a ledge, a lower cliff, a tree, or another object. This breaks up the momentum of your fall and divides it into several shorter falls, which gives you a much better chance of surviving., If your knees and elbows are locked and your muscles are rigid, the impact of the fall will do more harm to your vital organs. Don't hold yourself stiff. Do your best to relax your body so that when you hit the ground your body is more easily able to take the impact.


One way to remain (relatively) calm is to focus on performing the steps that lead to greater survival rates.
Stay aware of your body, moving your arms and legs to make sure they aren't locked.

, Possibly nothing is more important to surviving a fall (or simpler to do) than bending your knees. Research has shown that having one’s knees bent at impact can reduce the magnitude of impact forces 36-fold. However, do not bend them too far - only keep a slight bend so they are not locked.

, No matter what height you fall from, you should always try to land on your feet. Landing feet-first concentrates the impact force on a small area, allowing your feet and legs to absorb the worst of the blow. If you are in any other position, try to right yourself before you hit the ground.Fortunately, attaining the feet-first position seems to be an instinctive reaction.
Keep your feet and legs tightly together so that both your feet hit the ground at the same time.
Land on the balls of your feet. Point your toes slightly down before impact so that you will land on the balls of your feet. This will allow your lower body to more effectively absorb the impact.

, Once you land on your feet, you will fall either to the side, front or back. Try to avoid falling on your back. Falling to the side is statistically best. If you can't manage that, try to fall forward instead, breaking your fall with your arms.

, When you fall from a great height onto land, you will usually bounce. Some people who survive the initial impact (often with a feet-first landing) suffer a fatal injury on their second impact. You will most likely be unconscious when you bounce. Cover your head with your arms by placing your arms on the sides of your head with your elbows facing forward (and projecting in front of your face), and your fingers laced behind your head or neck. This covers a large portion of your head.

, With all the adrenaline flowing in response to your flight, you may not even feel injured upon landing. Even if you are not visibly injured, you may have sustained fractures or internal injuries that must be treated immediately. No matter how you’re feeling, get to a hospital as quickly as possible.

Slow your fall using the arch position.,
Find the best landing spot.,
Steer yourself to the landing spot.,
Use the correct landing technique.",How to Survive a Long Fall2," Unless you’re falling from an airplane, you won’t have enough time to try this step. Maximize your surface area by spreading yourself out using this skydiving technique.


Position yourself so that the front of your body faces the ground.
Arch your back and pelvis and tilt your head back like you’re trying to touch the back of your head to the back of your legs
Extend your arms and bend your elbows at a 90 degree angle so that your lower arms and hands point forward (parallel to, and on the sides of, your head) with your palms facing down; spread your legs to shoulder width.
Bend your knees slightly. Do not lock your legs and keep your leg muscles relaxed and fall into the motion to absorb most impact.

, For very high falls, the surface on which you land is the greatest influence on your chance of survival. Search for steep slopes that gradually grow gentler, since you will not lose all of your momentum at once when you hit the ground. Observe the terrain below you as you fall.


Hard, inflexible surfaces such as concrete are the worst on which to fall. Very uneven or jagged surfaces, which present less surface area to distribute the force of impact, are also undesirable.
The best possible surfaces on which to fall are those that will compress or give way when you fall on them, snow, soft ground (such as a newly tilled field or in a marsh), and trees or thick vegetation (although these present a high risk of impalement).
Water is only safe to fall into up to around 150 feet (45.7 m); past this height it will be little better than falling on cement as it cannot be compressed. Falling in water also presents the high risk of drowning (since you will most likely be knocked unconscious). Water is much safer to fall into if it is frothy and bubbly.

, If you’re falling from an airplane, you will usually have about 1-3 minutes before impact. You will also have the ability to travel horizontally a good distance (up to a couple of miles or three kilometers).


From the arch position described above, you can direct your flight forward by pulling your arms slightly back at the shoulders (so that they are not extended forward as much) and straightening (extending) your legs.
You can move backward by extending your arms and bending your knees as though you are trying to touch the back of your head with your heels.
Right turns may be accomplished while staying in the arch position by twisting your upper body slightly to the right (dipping your right shoulder), and left turns are performed by dipping the left shoulder.

, Remember to relax your body, keep your knees bent, and fall feet first. Fall forward, rather than backward, and protect your head with your arms in case you bounce.


If you are in an arch position, get your body vertical well before you hit the ground so that you don’t get caught in some other position at impact (as a guide, keep in mind that at 1,000 feet, depending on your velocity, you have about 6-10 seconds before impact).

Do not act like a victim.,
Be aware of your surroundings.,
Wear brightly colored or reflective clothing.,
Avoid walking in unlit areas, such as alleys or parks.,
Make sure someone knows where you are and what you are doing.,
Have emergency phone numbers memorized.,
Follow the buddy system.,
If you’re drinking, keep track of your drink.,
try to always have money for transportation.,
Know when the last bus leaves.",How to Stay Safe1," The perfect victim for predatory people is timid, weak, unobservant, willing to compromise him or herself to ""do the right thing"". It is even easier to take advantage of such a person if they are alone, in an isolated place, or intoxicated.

Act confident. Make appropriate eye contact with people in your surroundings. Walk with purpose.
Be polite and helpful, but do not compromise yourself. Sometimes predators will try to lure people by appealing to them for help. For instance, if someone in a car asks for directions, by all means help them - from a safe distance. Do not come to the car window.
Be with friends or a crowd. It is harder to commit a crime if people have someone with them. Victims are easier to victimize if they are alone. Even having other people nearby make it less likely a crime will occur.;
, You do not need to be obsessively vigilant on every little detail or go into paranoid fantasies. However, being aware will keep you from accidents and show potential criminals that you are paying attention.


Avoid constantly texting, talking on your phone, or otherwise allow devices to make you oblivious to your surrounding.
Do not have your earbuds on blasting music.
Pay attention to the people who are around you. If a drunk yelling obscenities down the street, you can notice him and avoid trouble.

, While this may seem counterproductive -- after all aren't you supposed to not draw attention to yourself? -- it actually helps you out in a couple different ways.Be visible. Brightly colored, reflective clothing and lights (such as a headlamp or bicycle lights) helps lessen the danger from car accidents. Wearing dark clothes at night can make you practically invisible. And traffic accidents are far more likely to happen than any crime.
It also can make you less of a target. Bright colors have a correlation with confidence and it can make someone who was going to mess with you, less likely to do so, because you're so visible.

, While unfortunate things can happen even in well-lit areas, someone can attack you much more easily in a darkened area and it will be much harder to get help should you need it.Stick to well-lit, public thoroughfares, roads, and paths for walking. The more people around, the better.

, If something happens to you, you definitely want to have at least one person who knows what you were doing and where you were going.


If you have to walk somewhere at night, make sure that a friend or trusted person knows the route that you took. This way if something does happen to you they know where to start looking.

, In this day and age your phone contains so much information that it's tempting not to memorize any of those numbers. You need to make a contingency plan in case you lose your cell phone, it gets stolen, or it runs out of batteries.


Along with the obvious emergency numbers (like the police or fire department) you should have a friend or two that you can call if you run into difficulty.
If you can, try to have these numbers be people who live in your area. While it can be tempting to call mom, she might live thousands of miles away and not be able to help you out at all.

, if you're going out at night, especially if you're going out clubbing or drinking, try to go with your friends. Make a plan before going out at night designating who is buddied up with whom. This way you'll only have to keep track of one other person and you'll know that someone is looking out for you, too.


If there is a designated driver, have them be in charge of making sure that all the friends are okay. You should also make sure that they get everyone's keys, so no one else tries to leave without them.

, If you have to go to the bathroom, go outside for a smoke, or something, and you haven't finished your drink, leave it with a trusted friend. You can't tell if someone has tampered with your drink (like if it has been roofied).


Just remember that even if someone does tamper your drink, it isn't your fault. It's the fault of the person who tampered the drink.

, Whether it's cab fare to get you back home, or it's money for the bus or subway, make sure that you always have the right amount to get you back from wherever you are.


Keep your backup money separate from the money you’re spending at night. This way you won't decide to spend your money on the night out, rather than on getting home.
This is important even if you're just coming back from work at night. If something makes you uncomfortable or nervous you want to have enough money to get yourself out of the situation by taking a cab or bus, if you need to.

, If you're out late and you need to catch a bus, or subway make sure that you know when the last one leaves. This way if you do miss it you don't have to wait around at the bus stop or tube station.


try to have a backup plan for if you do get stranded. Keep the number of a local cab company with you, or have a friend that you can call if you need to.
If you do take a bus late at night, sit near the driver. It's much more likely that you'll be robbed or harassed if you sit in the back of the bus than if you sit near the driver.

Have emergency numbers easily accessible.,
Place emergency devices in an easily accessible place.,
Make emergency plans.,
Install an alarm system.,
Keep doors and windows locked.,
Never tell someone that you’re home alone.,
Make sure the spare key is difficult for a potential intruder to find.,
Don’t go into the house if it looks like it's been broken into.",How to Stay Safe2," If you're at home, especially if you're by yourself, you need to make sure that you have any emergency phone numbers as accessible as possible, that way if something happens you don't have to go on the hunt for them.Have the numbers of emergency responders like the police, the fire department, or an ambulance.
You might also have poison control centers, or a local consulting nurse number in case of an accident or illness that you're not sure constitutes an emergency.
Have the number of a trusted neighbor or local friend that you can contact if something happens.

, If there's been a fire or an accident, or so on you don't want to have to dig through a bunch of stuff to find your emergency devices. Make sure everyone in the house knows where they're located.Keep the first aid kit in the bathroom in the same place so that you don't have to hunt for it if it's needed.
Make sure that you have one or more fire extinguishers in the right places around the house: in the kitchen and by a fireplace are two good places. Also, you want to ensure that you and the people in your household know how to use the fire extinguisher in case there's an emergency.
Place a flashlight in an obvious place. If the lights go out or there's a problem, you'll know exactly where the flashlight is.

, While you can't plan for everything, it's a good idea to have an emergency plan for the major problems that could happen while you're at home, especially if you're at home alone.


Have multiple escape routes for if there is a fire. Make sure that everyone in your household knows what to do and where to go.
Depending on where you live you might have an emergency plan for a tornado, a hurricane, an earthquake, and so on.
You might also try to make an emergency plan for if you ever had a home invasion: you might also figure out escape routes out of the house, where you might hide in the house, where you would go for help, and so on.

, It's really important that you have an early alert system for any problems that might happen while you're in the house. This could be anything from a fire, a carbon monoxide leak, or a home intruder.There are a variety of different alarm systems. Figure out which one works for you, or what your needs are. If carbon monoxide isn't a problem in your home, for example, then you won't need an early alert system for it.
Always make sure that your alarm system is set and that it has all the appropriate batteries and wiring. There's not much point in having an alarm system that's never functional.

, Unless you live in a place where no one locks their doors (many small towns) then you should keep these locked, especially if you're home alone. This is particularly important on the ground floor which can create easy access for any burglars or intruders.


Depending on the area you live in, you may need to install bars on your windows, especially at the ground floor.

, If someone comes to the door and asks to speak with you about something, avoid telling them that you're the only one there. If you live in an apartment building and someone you don't know wants to buzz you in, avoid doing so unless you're absolutely sure of them.


You also don't want to post on Facebook or other social media how you're home alone.
This is especially important if you're a kid and you're at home alone. While things rarely happen the way they do in movies (like Home Alone, for example) you don't want to risk anyone deciding your house is vulnerable because you're the only one there.

, The best thing to do with a spare key is give it to a trusted neighbor and get it from them if you lock yourself out. Otherwise you should make certain to hide the key really well.


This means, don't hide it under the front mat, or a nearby flowerpot. That's the first place a potential intruder will look.
An example might be hiding a key to the shed on a hook beneath the back porch and having to use the key to the shed to get the house key from a hiding place in the locked shed.

, If you get home and see a broken window or the door open when it shouldn’t be, then you should not go and investigate. Instead go to a neighbor's house and call the cops.


If a light is on that shouldn't be on, call the home phone and check that it isn't a family member back when you didn't expect them.
Checking to see if the intruder is still in your home can lead to bad consequences for you, so it's best to call the cops and let them handle it.

Make duplicates of important documents.,
Do research before you go.,
Learn something of the local language.,
Inform a trusted person about your itinerary.,
Have a decoy wallet and phone.,
Do not parade around flaunting your valuables.,
Keep an eye on your important items.,
Always separate your cash.,
Stay aware.,
Be skeptical of anyone who is being overly nice.",How to Stay Safe3," If something happens to your passport, or any important travel documents (like an identification card, any visa information, etc.) you want to have duplicates of those to show to police or to a consulate.


Keep your duplicates in a different place than your actual documents. For example, if you have a purse you're keeping all the important documents like passport and so on, keep your duplicates in a different bag.
You should also leave duplicates of everything with a trusted friend or family member. That way if everything gets lost or stolen you can contact them and get the copies of the documents from them.

, Know as much about the area you're traveling to as possible. Find out what places are safe and what places aren't safe, so that you know what areas to avoid.


Make sure you’re aware of local customs so you don’t offend people. There are certain gestures in the U.S., for example, that are extremely rude in other parts of the world.
Ask locals where is safe to go. The locals are the ones who are the most likely to recommend good places to go, as well as where to stay away from. There are lots of websites (like the one for Couchsurfing) where you can connect up with people from the area over the internet and they should be able to give you information.

, While you're probably not going to be able to become fluent, you should at least make sure you can access enough of the language to communicate if you get into trouble.


Have a sheet of important phrases (not just ""Where's the bathroom?"") with things like: how to get to the train/bus station, where is the nearest police station/home country consulate, internet cafe, and so on.
Knowing enough to make basic communication with local people will make locals more likely to help you, because you have made an effort to be more than just a tourist.

, This is especially important if you're traveling alone. Somebody who is responsible should know where you are supposed to be and what you're supposed to be doing. This way, if you don't show up at the place you're supposed to be, someone will be able to start making inquiries.


If your itinerary changes make sure that you connect with your trusted person and let them know that it has changed.

, A decoy wallet is basically a wallet that has an expired credit card, maybe an old i.d. card, and a few smaller denominations of whatever country's currency you're using. If you have a decoy wallet and someone robs you, they’ll only get the decoy wallet.Do not bring your fancy phone or wallet packed with money with you traveling. You'll be far more likely to be robbed.

, This ties in with the above step. Don't bring your expensive jewelry, watch, cell phone, laptop, and so on with you when you go traveling. While you can be robbed just as easily at home, it's more likely to happen when you're an obvious tourist in a place that you don't know well., Always stay alert when you're traveling. It can be easy to drop your vigilance for a moment, but that's the moment when someone can snag your camera, or your purse.


Make a mental checklist of your most important items (like your wallet, your phone, your passport, etc.) and pause every now and then to make sure they're still there. It's easy to get flustered or in a rush while traveling and that's when you tend to lose things.
Check around your area if you’ve been sitting somewhere for awhile or before you get off something like a bus.

, Never, ever, keep all your cash in one place. Spread it out through your things. Keep some in your decoy wallet, some in your actual wallet, some in your bag, in your sock, in your other bag.


This way, if on thing gets stolen or you get robbed, you won't be completely without money.

, When you're traveling it's easy to get into a different headspace, one that isn't very aware. You're stressed, you're hurrying, you're wanting too look at lots of things, it's totally understandable.The reason people tend to be robbed while they're traveling isn't because other countries are more crime-ridden than your country. It's because you're more likely to be paying attention when you're home and you're more likely to notice when something is out-of-place.
Thieves can orchestrate or take advantage of a chaotic situation to rob you. If a bunch of people are swarming around you, pay attention for any little hands in your pockets.
The more alert you look, the less likely you are to be pinpointed as an easy target.

, Thieves can orchestrate situations where they distract you by ""helping"" you while a confederate robs you. Be wary of anyone who is too nice.


Unless everyone in the area is super nice, then you should be skeptical of anyone who is going above and beyond, or is incredibly insistent about offering you some assistance that is very distracting.

Pick swimming sites with lifeguards.,
Learn basic swimming skills.,
Use certified flotation devices.,
Recognize and avoid strong currents.,
Don't panic if you find yourself in a strong current.,
If you feel yourself start to lose control, tread water or float.,
Don’t use drugs or alcohol.",How to Prevent Drowning1," The safest choice when selecting swimming sites are ones that have life guards on-duty. Certified lifeguards are your greatest friends of all when you're swimming — the presence of lifeguards at swimming site has been shown to have a serious, proven effect on drowning prevention.


A well-managed pool or beach with lifeguard supervision takes measures to head off hazards, such as knowing where dangerous undertows are, and have the authority to remove teenagers playing around in an unsafe manner.
Lifeguards are trained to spot swimmers on the verge of drowning and act quickly to safe lives.
Certified lifeguards should know how to perform CPR, which means that they have the potential to save a swimmer's life even in the dangerous situation that they lose consciousness in the water.
However, lifeguards should be treated like a fire extinguisher---critical if needed, but one should do everything possible to avoid having to use one. Take all safety measures you would take even if the lifeguard was not there. ;
, For obvious reasons, knowing how to swim can greatly reduce your risk of drowning. For absolute beginners, skills like the crawl stroke and treading water can allow you move and float with ease in the water, improving your confidence and security while you swim. Do not rely solely on the ""doggie paddle"" to prevent yourself from drowning — it's not as effective or energy-efficient as actual swimming strokes.However, it is better than not swimming at all!


If you are not a confident swimmer, consider enrolling in swimming lessons. Swimming lessons are estimated to reduce the risk of drowning by 88% in very young children, but can provide life-saving knowledge even to adults.
Swimmers can still drown. Just being able to swim does not mean you are immune from drowning. This statement is not to discourage anyone from learning to swim - just that over-confidence can be every bit as dangerous as an inability to swim at all. ""Drown-proofing"" does not exist. , Life jackets and other flotation devices can keep their wearer afloat in the water even if they are unconscious or unable to swim, making them a valuable aid in and around the water.For some situations, flotation devices may even be a legal necessity — in the United States, for instance, many states require boaters to wear a properly-fitted life jacket (or at least have one for each person on board). Usually, these life jackets will need to be certified by the US Coast Guard to be considered valid.Do not rely on ""water wings"", foam noodles, and other pool toys to keep you afloat — these are not designed to keep non or weak swimmers from going under.
Even if you are a strong swimmer, wear your life jacket in boating situations. In the even of a capsize, for instance, if you are struck unconscious the lifeguard can save your life.

, If you have done most of your swimming in man-made pools, it's easy to forget that bodies are often subject to the forces of natural currents. If these currents are strong enough, they can pose serious dangers, especially to weak or inexperienced swimmers. Particularly dangerous are ""rip currents,"" strong, fast currents that occur near to shore and can pull swimmers out to sea. If you're at the beach, be ready to spot these common rip current warning signs:A narrow channel of particularly choppy water
Water with a noticeably different color than the water around it
Irregular wave patterns
A line of debris or seaweed moving steadily out to sea

, In the unlikely event that you are caught in a strong current, knowing how to react intelligently can save your life. Though this can be a very scary experience, try your best not to panic — in this case, letting your natural instincts take over can be a bad idea. Rather than trying to fight the current, instead, turn 90 degrees and swim parallel to the shore as hard as you can. Since most rip currents are active only in relatively narrow channels, eventually, you'll get out of the rip current and into calmer waters.

, Most people's natural reaction to the sensation of beginning to drown is to fight as hard as they can to keep their head high above the water.Unfortunately, this is one of the worst things to do when you're drowning — it can quickly deplete your energy reserves, tire you out, and actually make it harder to signal for help. Usually, it's a much better idea to tread water or use a floating technique to conserve energy so that you can make a try for the shore or signal for help.


To tread water, turn yourself upright in the water and make an in-and-out sweeping motion with your arms to stabilize your upper body. As you do this, make an easy, bicycle-like kicking motion to keep yourself afloat.
If you're completely out of energy, using a survival float can allow you to rest in the water. Turn prone (face-down) and spread your limbs out wide, using only minimal movements to keep yourself afloat. Lift your head when you need to breathe.
Keep in mind that you only need to keep your mouth a little out of the water to be able to breathe — fighting to stay high in the water is usually a waste of energy.

, Being impaired in the water is a sure-fire recipe for danger. Alcohol, in particular, can be a very bad choice — not only does it impair your judgement and motor skills, but it also makes you more susceptible to hypothermia (injury or death from getting too cold).However, because many drugs' effects can be just as bad (or worse), it's a bad idea to get in the water when you're under the influence of any sort of psychoactive substance, so stay sober when you're swimming.

Learn CPR.,
Designate a lifeguard or water monitor.,
Know who’s most at risk.,
Be aware of any swimmer’s medical disorders.,
Be aware that drowning is often a silent phenomenon.",How to Prevent Drowning2," CPR, or Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, is a very important lifesaving technique for anyone who plans to spend time around the water. CPR allows a rescuer to circulate a drowning victim's blood throughout their body and, sometimes, even restore their ability to breathe. While CPR alone can sometimes save drowning victims' lives, it can also help stave off death until emergency services arrive. CPR classes are usually brief and today can even be completed online, making it easier than ever to get the skills needed to save another person's life.If you don't know how to do CPR, most sources recommend only attempting chest compressions, not more advanced airway-clearing techniques or rescue breathing.To do chest compressions, kneel next to the unconscious victim on a hard surface and place both your hands on top each other on his or her chest. Use your upper body weight (not just your arms) to compress the person's chest about two inches. Perform compressions at a rate of about 100 per minute until paramedics arrive or the person regains consciousness.

, Perhaps the single most important thing you can do to ensure water safety is to make sure there is always someone watching the swimmers in the water who is ready to jump in at a moment's notice. Trained lifeguards, of course, make the best water monitors, but even an ordinary strong swimmer can make do in a pinch.


If your water monitors are worried that they won't be able to join in the fun, try taking shifts! Just don't let anyone who's drunk or otherwise impaired be your monitor — saving someone from drowning can be a game of seconds, so you don't want anyone with a slowed reaction speed to be your lifeguard.

, On the individual level, a person's swimming ability and the conditions they're swimming in usually determine whether or not a person is at risk for drowning. When dealing with very large numbers of people, however, it's possible to observe certain demographic trends with regards to drowning rates — essentially, certain types of people are more likely to drown than others. Below are just a few different types of people that, statistically, are more prone to drowning than the baseline average rate:Children: Very young children (ages 1-5) are especially susceptible to drowning. In fact, drowning is the leading cause of death under the age of 5.
Men: Men make up more than 80% of all drowning fatalities. It is unclear if this is due to a greater preference for risk-taking behavior, biological abilities, or simply a greater preference for swimming.
Urban poor/minorities: In the United States, certain socioeconomic groups have disproportionately high rates of drowning deaths due to factors like lack of access to swimming pools and lack of water-based recreational activities. For instance, African American children 5-19 drown in swimming pools almost six times more often than whites.

, If a person has a medical condition that may give them decreased motor function or otherwise impair them while they're in the water, this is information that should definitely be told to the water monitor before swimming begins. For instance, conditions like epilepsy can leave someone helpless in the water if they have a seizure, so the water monitor should keep an extra-close eye on these people. In addition, if there is any sort of equipment that's necessary for quick, lifesaving treatment of the condition (for instance, EpiPens for people with severe allergies), you'll want to have this equipment available in the event of a worst-case scenario.

, Drowning often doesn't occur the way it appears in movies — as a loud, violent, chaotic struggle to stay above water. In fact, someone who's in the process of drowning may be unable to get their head above the water long enough to even call for help. Because of this, there usually won't be any sort of warning sounds that a drowning is occurring.A person may even drown without the people next to them knowing that anything is wrong until it's too late. For this reason, it's extremely important for the water monitor not to let their visual attention wander from the swimmers they're supposed to be watching. Know the following warning signs of silent drowning:Stiff, upright body with arms pushing down against the water (not waving or signalling for help)
The inability for the drowning person to speak (they are focusing on breathing)
Periods of intense struggling on the surface followed by submerging underwater with breath held
The inability for the drowning person to keep their mouth above the water consistently

There is no such thing as ""drown proofing"" or ""safety proofing"" children.,
Never let children swim unsupervised.,
Make your pool area safe and the pool inaccessible while you are not swimming.,
If you cannot spot a child, rush to the spa or the pool first, time is crucial!,
Have a pool safety kit for your spa or swimming pool.,
Never leave toys near the pool.,
Consider draining your pool.,
Understand that young children can drown in very shallow water.",How to Prevent Drowning3," Being able to swim proficiently does not mean a child (or adult) cannot drown. Learning about water safety at swim lessons does not mean that they will not do something unsafe the very same day. Let your children learn the basic water safety rules and review them anytime they need to go in a spa or pool., While it's a bad idea for anyone to swim alone, for children, it should be a hard and fast rule. Never let children swim without adult supervision, no matter whether they're at the beach, in your household pool, in a public pool, or at a friend's house.Even young children who have received swimming lessons can be more vulnerable to drowning than older children who haven't, so supervision is key to keeping your children safe until they're mature, responsible swimmers on their own.



Supervised means watching without distractions; no phone, tablet, book, or the like. It is one thing to make a quick text, but if you are absorbed on a game on your device, you are not really paying full attention to your child.
Ensure the distance between you and your toddlers is arm’s length while the child is in the pool even when he/she has a floating device. Floating aids are not as secure as approved life vests, and they can give adults and children the wrong sense of security.
If you’re leaving your child with a babysitter or a teenage supervisor, make sure they know your water safety rules. Be especially sure to remind them that drowning often has no audible warning noises, so visual supervision is necessary.

, Putting physical barriers like a pool fence between your children and your pool can often be enough to keep them out of it when you're not there to supervise them. Young children are attracted to pools and don't understand the danger. Below are just a few basic ideas for kid-proofing your pool:


Keep ground-level pools fenced off with an at least 4 feet high fence. Use play pens, iron, chain link or mesh pool fences to form a protective barrier around your pool.
Use a self-closing, self-locking pool gate. If you don't have a self-closing gate, be sure to lock any gates or doors in the fencing after swimming
Remove ladders for above-ground pools. If your children are too small to climb into above-ground pools without a ladder, simply take the ladder away to keep them out.
If possible, use a cover or lid for your pool. Many pools and hot tubs come with hard lids or plastic covers. Usually, these are used for weatherproofing the pool when not in use, but they can also be an effective deterrent against children if they're sturdy enough to keep them out.
Always ensure the spa and pool covers are working, and the walkways surfaces such as diving boards, ladders, decks are non-slippery. Replace or reinforce in case there is a wear out.
To avoid injuries in the pool, cover all sharp edges and raised hard surfaces.
Keep all electrical devices away from the spa or pool to avoid electrical shock. Ensure all the wiring are maintained and are installed professionally.
Do not go to the pool during rough weather like high winds or thunderstorms

,

You can install an underwater or surface alarm that will alert you when someone fell into the pool.
You can also set gate chimes or alarms to alert you when someone opens the pool gate
Keep tables, climbable surfaces and chairs far to avoid children from climbing over into the pool.

, These include:

Floatation device
An emergency portable phone
A pair of scissors
First aid kit

, Children are less likely to want to swim unsupervised if they are not tantalized by brightly-colored toys. After finishing a trip to the beach or a swim in your backyard pool, put away and secure the toys. The prospect of swimming may become much less attractive to your children. Plus, the toys will last longer and not become a tripping hazard.

, One sure-fire way to keep children from drowning in your pool is to remove the water from the equation. If the pool is completely drained, children will have less of a reason to enter it unsupervised and, even if they do, they won't be able to drown. This can be a somewhat tricky process, so, if you're unsure of how to proceed, contact a plumber or an experienced pool professional.


Keep in mind, however, that draining some types of pools and leaving them exposed to direct sunlight can damage the plaster material at the bottom of the pool., Babies and toddlers can drown in as little as one inch of water.Tragically, not all parents and caretakers are aware of this. For this reason, it's extremely important to monitor these types of young children whenever they're around water of any depth, including when they're in the bathtub or around buckets of water. If you need to leave for any reason, take your baby with you — the amount of time it takes to you to answer the door, for instance, can be enough time for a baby to start drowning.


Don't rely on bathtub seats to keep your child safe in the tub. There are multiple ways these can fail — for instance, their suction cups can come unstuck from the tub or the baby may crawl out of the seat.
Products around the house containing or collecting water can be drowning hazards. The most common of these outside are buckets or the top of pool covers which can collect rainwater. Drowning deaths have also involved ponds, sinks, fish tanks, among other products.

Know the basics of reading a map to locate the rivers, streams, or bodies of water before venturing out.,
Research water sources with a map before you go on your trip.,
Bring at least two liters of water per day.,
Take water purifiers with you.,
If you see hikers coming from the opposite direction, stop and share information about verified water sources.

,
""Camel up"" whenever you stop at a water source.,
Go downhill.,
Look around you while walking for birches, alders, cottonwoods and willows.,
In the desert, the best bet will be to find a dry riverbed, preferably one that has some form of shade most of the day, and dig into the outside of a bend.,
You can safely drink your own urine and though it is not too tasty, it won’t kill you.",How to Find Water in the Wilderness,"


Many maps mark seasonal creeks with dotted blue lines, solid blue lines are more permanent rivers and creeks. Permanent rivers can always dry up as well.
Learn how to read elevation lines on topo maps. Generally, where lines are spread out it is fairly flat, where they are closer together, terrain is steep.
Green patches mark areas where tree growth makes it much harder to find your way without compass navigation experience.;
, Be aware that some sources may be seasonal and may dry up late in summer. During droughts, this is especially problematic. Guidebooks often state whether the water source is reliable year round or not.


Many springs shown on a USGS Topo Map (or GPS maps based on Government maps) may no longer be in existence. Many USGS Topo Maps were originally compiled many decades ago, and in wilderness areas. Map features like springs, or man-made facilities like mines, roads, and other infrastructure, may have long since disappeared. Even if a surface spring turns out to still be flowing, it may be heavily choked with vegetation, or located in an inaccessible place like a steep cliff, keeping the water inaccessible. With this in mind, it is very risky to take a long hike to an unknown spring shown on a map, if you are already low on water.

, Ideally, you should carry more than that, or plan to refill at the water sources you've already identified along your planned route.


In moderate temperatures of 75-85 degrees Fahrenheit, backpackers would likely need 6-8 liters per day, but not necessarily all of it on their backs as they hike. Probably 2-3 liters during the day would be a good number to start with, depending on the person, mileage, temperature, weather, and other factors.It's important to not just drink plain water or hyponatremia (low sodium) can result--it can be life-threatening. Eating salty snacks, energy bars or using hydration mix with electrolytes will help prevent this.

, You can take water purifier tablets or a micro-strainer tube for multi-day walks that have fairly obvious and many water sources. Using a Sawyer, Katadyn, UV light filter, or Aquamira tablets, you can drink pretty much any water you can find. Mechanical filters eliminate all particulates above a certain size, whereas UV filters and tablets do not; they just kill the nasty bacteria in the water making it safe to drink.


Note that some hikers (not all) find that chemical tablets leave a residual taste that some find unappealing.
Keep in mind the dirtier the water, the longer your mechanical filter will take to filter the water. Mechanical filters can also get clogged. For especially cloudy water it's best to repeat the purification method a second time, e.g. refilter, retreat with tablets or drops or repeat the procedure with the UV light purifier.
It's safest to bring a backup method of purification in case the primary method fails. Filters can break, tablets can get wet and batteries that power a device can fail.
If you have a stove with you, you can always boil water at a full rolling boil for a minimum of one minute. Increase boiling time to three minutes at altitudes above 6,562 feet (2,000 meters).This is a very effective method of purification.

,, When you're starting your hike and you're at a water source and when you're filling your water bottles, drink as much as you can, then fill your bottle for the next part of the trip. Sometimes you can get a whole liter in just while taking a break! It's easier to carry it in your stomach and you'll get re-hydrated quickly.

, Water is, as is everything else in the universe, affected by gravity. So, the only logical conclusion is that water would be downhill. Find valleys where there are streams and lakes. Generally, the smaller the water source is, the cleaner the water is. If you can find where the water comes out of the ground, it's probably safe enough to drink without a filter or tablets. Of course, if dehydration is a threat, you have to weigh the cleanliness of the water with the risks of dehydration.

, These types of trees are often near water.

, Sometimes dry creek beds have had flash flooding and are moist beneath the surface. It is rare that this will yield much if any result though. If you are that desperate in the desert, you're probably better off using your energy to get found and rescued.

, It could well mean the difference between life and death.

Determine whether or not to do a safety vault.,
Place one or both hands on top of the fence.,
Hop into the air and rest your foot on the top of the fence.,
Bring your other leg over the fence.,
Land softly.",How to Hop a Fence1," Also called a step vault, the safety vault is the best jumping technique for beginners.This jump can be done from a stationary, walking, or running start. If you’re intimidated by the idea of running towards the fence, do the jump from a walking or standing position.


This jump works best for waist-high obstacles. If the fence is too high, you may trip or have trouble clearing the fence.
Clear any debris from around the fence. If you land on debris you may twist an ankle.;
, Absolute beginners should use two hands. If you’re confident that you’re strong enough to guide yourself over the fence, use one hand. Lean forward, supporting your weight with your arms.If you’re nervous about jumping over the fence, test yourself holding yourself up for a few seconds. This will help you gauge your own strength.

, First, hop into the air. While airborne, place the ball of your foot against the top of the fence. This foot will help you balance and allow you to propel yourself off the fence.


The faster you approach the fence, the more important this foot is for balance.

, Curl your free leg against your body and bring your knee towards your chest. Guide your foot over the fence, using your outside foot for balance. As you move your leg, lift the hand closest to your legs away from the fence. This will give you more space to maneuver your legs.Keep your shoulders and head down as you move. Otherwise, your feet may catch on the edge of the fence and you’ll fall over.

, Push off slightly with your resting foot to help move yourself away from the fence. Your free foot will hit the ground first, followed by your resting foot. If possible, land on the balls of your feet to reduce the risk of injury.


Point your feet and knees forward as you land. If you don’t, you may twist an ankle.
Bend your knees as you land. This will help you avoid knee injuries."
"
Determine whether or not to do a speed vault.,
Run towards the fence.,
Place your dominant hand on fence.,
Kick your legs out to the side.,
Land in an upright position.",How to Hop a Fence2," Speed vaulting is popular with intermediate and advanced jumpers because they conserve momentum. You can jump over obstacles at high speed without slowing down or stopping. However, don’t attempt this jump unless you’re already comfortable doing a safety vault.Make sure the area you’re jumping into is clear of debris. Otherwise, you may land badly and injure yourself.

, This jumping technique uses your momentum to carry you over the fence. Therefore, the faster you run, the better this technique will work for you. If you’re nervous about trying this jump, approach the fence at a brisk jog instead of a run.


Approach the fence head-on. If you approach at an angle you won’t be able to clear the fence.

, This will be your “support arm,” or the arm that carries you over the fence.Don’t slap your hand down onto the fence or you’ll lose momentum. Instead, gently and firmly place your hand down as you run.

, Jump up quickly, kicking your outside leg into the air. Drive your knees upwards and to the side, one over another. Your body will naturally slant to the side parallel to the fence.


Keep your shoulders facing forward as you jump. Keep your dominant arm straight as you jump. If your arm is curved you may not be able to support your body., Land with your inside leg first and follow with your outside leg. Bend your knees slightly as you land to reduce the impact and protect your joints from injury. Your hand will leave the fence on its own as your momentum carries you forward. Keep your chest forward and continue running."
"
Determine whether or not to do a monkey vault.,
Run towards the fence with your arms extended.,
Place both hands on the fence.,
Jump over the fence.,
Land carefully.",How to Hop a Fence3," This jump is not recommended for beginners. If the fence has a steep drop on the other side you may hurt yourself while jumping. Similarly, make sure the ground is free of debris before jumping over an obstacle. Otherwise, you could twist an ankle when you land.


The monkey vault is good for jumping waist-high fences and obstacles. However, if the fence is too high, you’ll have trouble clearing it with this jump.

, You will be using your momentum to carry yourself over the fence. If you’re intimidated by running towards the fence, practice an easier jump such as the safety vault until you’re more confident.

, Once you’re about a foot away from the fence, firmly plant both palms on the fence. Your hands should be a shoulder-width apart. Lean forward into your hands and duck your head down.Don’t slap your hands onto the fence. If you do, you’ll lose some momentum.

, Keep your chest facing forward and bring your knees up to your chest as you jump. Duck your head and shoulders low to allow enough space underneath you for your legs.Your back will be parallel to the ground as you jump. This will give you room to move your feet underneath you and over the fence.


Be careful not to clip your toes on the fence. This will happen if your head isn’t low enough and cause you to fall.
Some people like to push with their arms after their feet clear the fence to help vault themselves further.

, You can land on both feet at once or one after another. When landing, make sure to keep your knees slightly bent to reduce the risk of injury to your legs. Similarly, try to land on the balls of your feet to help protect your ankles. This will also help protect your knees by forcing them to flex as you land."

Find a rock climbing gym.,
Try another gym.,
Get a membership.,
Find a partner.,
Take a lesson.,
Get the necessary equipment.,
Join a climbing club at your gym.",How to Start Indoor Rock Climbing1," There are many rock climbing gyms in your area and around the world.Look for a gym with top roping, which is when the rope is already set for you. If there are many gyms, look at reviews. Consider the facilities as a whole, what materials they offer, their general location, their operating hours, and their size. Also, make sure there are a staff members available to belay you. Otherwise, you might be bouldering or on auto-belays all day.;
, You won't know what you like or if a rock climbing gym is a good fit, unless you visit several facilities. A different gym could be better, more beginner-friendly, or a nicer place to spend your time.

, If you like the gym, consider getting a membership. If you get a membership and go frequently, you’ll save money in the long run. Sometimes, memberships have other rewards too. They might offer exclusive climbing opportunities, access to additional gear, or the use of private facilities.

, Although at the start, you can climb alone on auto-belays or with a staff member, a partner will soon become important.


Make sure your partner knows what they are doing.Whether it is simply supporting you or belaying you down the side of the rock face, you want someone you can trust. If you don’t trust them, you will be more likely to panic if you get stuck at a difficult spot or angle.

, Most indoor rock climbing gyms offer basic and advanced lessons for climbers. Not only will they teach you how to use the equipment properly, to climb safely, and to develop efficient techniques for scaling certain obstacles, but lessons can be great places to make contacts, find partners, and learn from each other.


Technique is more important in the long run than building strength. Think about each move, how your hands should grip around rocks, and what your feet can do for you as you propel up the side of a rock face. Get to know what works for you and what is comfortable. Not everyone climbs the exact same way, but lessons will get you started.

, Make sure your gym offers harness and rock shoe rentals. If it doesn't, you might want to choose another gym if you aren't ready to purchase your own gear.


Depending on your level of commitment and available money, you should consider getting your own gear. Purchasing a harness, rock shoes, and belay device might seem expensive right now.However, in the long run, you'll have better gear to work with than what is normally offered by a gym. Make sure to get the belay device you learned with, along with a carabiner. A harness should be safe, comfortable, and fit you securely. The rock shoes should probably fit you fairly comfortably, lace-up, and have a flat, not down-turned, sole.

, There are normally clubs for novices and experts. Some clubs mix the two groups, which gives the beginners a great opportunity to learn from more experienced climbers. Joining a group is a great way to motivate yourself and to learn. Join online groups as well. Learn about new techniques, equipment, rock climbing locations, and rock climbing events."

Learn how to stretch.,
Build strength.,
Strengthen your grip.,
Strengthen your shoulders and upper back.,
Workout your core muscles.,
Don’t forget your legs.,
Practice balancing.,
Practice breathing.",How to Start Indoor Rock Climbing2," Rock Climbing will stretch your limbs in ways you didn’t even know about. Make sure you stretch thoroughly before each climb. You don’t want to pull a muscle or have a muscle tense up at a crucial point. There are many different kinds of stretches in standing and sitting positions. Use stretches with a lot of motion to stretch several regions.Stretch your upper body. Focus on your triceps and lateral muscles the most. These are the muscles that will help pull you up the rock face most.Stretch your lower body. The most important parts of your legs to stretch are your ham strings, quads, and calves. Your legs will do the heaviest lifting. These three areas are the most likely to be pulled., Climbing requires both technical skill and a minimum level of strength. If you sacrifice one for the other, you won’t be a good rock climber. Workout. Focus on both your upper body and your lower body muscles. Rock climbing is a full body sport., Work out your upper arms, forearms, and wrists/hands. We’ve all heard the phrase, you’re only as strong as your weakest link. Make sure that every part of your arm is strong. Don’t just focus on biceps. If you do, you’ll be able to lift yourself up faster, but your hands will tire before you even get a chance to fully use your upper arm strength.


Use a squeeze ball regularly to strengthen the wrist and hand region. Lift small weights frontwards and sideways to improve overall arm strength. Try to do exercises that replicate rock climbing. Do static hangs on a bar to strengthen those muscles needed for static hangs while climbing., Do pull-up exercises and use simple arm rotations with basic weights to strengthen these muscles. As you become stronger, look into more sport-specific training exercises like hang boards, campus boards, and system boards., Take time to focus on your abdominal and lower back muscles. Your goal is not to have huge core muscles, but to develop a highly flexible and stable core. As with other exercises designed to build strength for rock climbing, focus on exercises that replicate rock climbing movement. Sit-ups, crunches, dumbbell side bends, and back bridges are all great exercises for strengthening these muscles., Last, but not least, focus a lot of your time on your legs. Many people forget to work out their legs, but when it comes to rock climbing, your legs will propel you up the rock face and will be integral to repelling back down. Be sure to not overdo your legs. Keep them flexible. You might get in tight spaces, where “cumbersome” leg muscles will reduce your mobility. Run on a treadmill, swim laps in a pool, lift leg weights, or walk around with training weights attached to your calves. Emphasize mobility along with strength., Balance is very important when climbing. You need to be aware of your center of gravity in order to properly assess your next move.A slack-line is a great way to improve your balance and there are many exercises you can do with it., This may sound silly, but you need to be able to control your breath while climbing. Breathing too quickly is a great way to wear yourself down. This isn’t what you want. Practice breathing with a stopwatch. See how regular you can make your breaths."

Wear the right gear.,
Warm up.,
Visualize your route before you start.,
Start climbing.,
Rest on the wall.,
Concentrate on the wall in front of you.,
Gauge your next move carefully.,
Use your upper body and legs.,
Take safety seriously.",How to Start Indoor Rock Climbing3," Don’t wear clothes that will limit your mobility. Wear shorts and a tighter t-shirt. Wear shoes with excellent grips or shoes designed for rock climbing. Many people like to wear gloves with grips on them. This will save you from building up calluses and will improve your performance overall.


If you don't want to wear gloves, be sure to use rock climbing chalk. This fine powder sticks to your hands and adds more to your gripping power.

, Take your time. Warm up your muscles before you start climbing. Run in place. Try climbing just a few steps up and then lower yourself back down. This will tell your muscles that you’re ready to climb. Do your stretches too., Climbing is just as much mental as it is physical and knowing where you will go beforehand will help improve your climb. Think of the wall like a maze with the floor as your starting point and the top of the wall as the finish line. Trace a path from hold to hold with your eyes and then follow that path., Start slow. Take your time. Don’t push yourself far beyond your limits. Start with easier climbs first. Only after you’ve mastered these, should you advance to more difficult walls. Ask staff members for advice on routes to take, walls to climb, and techniques to try. They’ve been on these walls a lot longer than you and are a great repository of knowledge.

, When you find good rests or places that you can easily hold onto, take a minute to catch your breath. You know it is a good resting place, if you feel comfortable hanging one limb off the wall. Learning how to rest is an important part of developing good technique.


This is also a good time to reassess your route. If you found one part of the course more difficult than you originally thought, you may choose to take a moment and trace out a new path. This is what you would do when rock climbing outdoors, so practice this indoors.

, People who are afraid of heights tend to look down, which triggers their anxiety. Beginners who aren’t afraid of heights tend to keep their eyes fixed on the top of the wall. This leads them to overestimate their abilities and to not concentrate on their next hold, which can have disastrous effects.


Start off slowly if you are afraid of heights. Only go as high as you are comfortable, and slowly work on going a bit higher each climb. Remember that you are completely safe. The weakest piece of equipment (the carabiner)can support almost 2,500 lbs if used properly and about 1,000 lbs if not. Falling injuries are rare in a gym., Most rock climbers tell you not to overreach. Sometimes, you might feel the need to reach beyond your normal radius. Avoid this whenever possible. Reach for the closest rock. Secure your foot in a comfortable position. This will maximize your own safety and ensure that you make it to the top.

, Beginners tend to overcompensate with one or the other. Keep your body over your legs as much as possible and use your arms to guide yourself up. The goal here is to minimize the amount of effort placed on one muscle group. This is how you strain muscles. By using both parts of your body and paying close attention to how you use these muscles, you’ll be a much more efficient climber.

, A rock climber's worst enemy — indoors or outdoors — is overconfidence. You might think that you are an advanced climber and that you can take chances. Don’t do it. Make sure you are always secured to the rock face. There are thousands of factors to consider with each grip and foothold. You never know if you’ll need to adjust at the last second or not.

"
"
Don’t climb too often.,
Fuel your body.Eat healthy and pick foods that will rejuvenate lost energy and help build muscle, like protein-rich meats, nuts, and soy beans.,
Drink a lot of water.,
Get enough rest.",How to Start Indoor Rock Climbing4," Every other day is a good rule of thumb for most beginners. Just like with other sports, it is necessary to rest your muscles and to review your technique, in order to improve. Rock climbing is no different. Don’t climb with pulled muscles. You’ll need all of your strength to climb rocks successfully.

, Eat complex carbohydrates after your climb. Eat green vegetables, like grains, starchy vegetables, beans, and peas. Some people like to eat dark chocolate as well.

, Drink water before the climb and between climbs. Cramps are caused by dehydration. Your hands and feet are the first parts of your body to start cramping when you become dehydrated. You don’t want to cramp up on the wall. Always replace the fluids you lose through sweating from the climb. , If you are tired, your brain won’t function well enough to properly assess each step. You’ll be more likely to fall, which can be discouraging and hurt your overall motivation.

Wrap the rope around your upper thigh.,
Tie a bowline knot to secure the first leg.,
Tie another bowline around your other leg.,
Take the long end around your back and through the crosspiece.,
Strengthen the harness.,
Tie the two ends together with a square knot.,
Back up both sides.,
Clip in the carabiner to the crosspiece.,
Check that your harness is secure.,
Anchor to something sturdy.",How to Make a Rope Harness," First, wrap the end of the rope around one leg, starting between the legs and winding around the outside of your figure to meet the rest of the rope at the upper thigh. The rope should rest comfortably beneath your rear. Pull the end through so that you have about two feet of slack to tie the knot.


Make sure to use a rope that is thick enough to support your weight. If possible, use a dedicated climbing rope that is designed to hold up against the shock of a fall. Consider using climbing webbing.;
, If you made the first loop around your right leg, then use your left ""steady"" hand to form a small loop in the long side of the rope that runs between your legs. Hold the loose end of the rope in your right hand. Then, pull the loose end up toward you through the loop, and wrap it around the base of the loop. Thread the end of the rope back through the loop. Finally, pull the ends in opposite directions to tighten the knot.Think of the loop as a ""rabbit's hole,"" and the long end coming off the loop as a ""tree"". Imagine that the loose end of the rope, which you're holding in your right hand, is the ""rabbit"". The rabbit comes up the hole, runs around the tree, and goes back down the hole.The loose short end of the rope serves to secure your leg. The long end will loop around the other leg, and will eventually become the ""crosspiece"" to which you clip the carabiner.

, Wrap the long end of the rope around your other leg, but be sure to leave room for a small ""rabbit's hole"" loop where the rope goes between your legs. Tie the bowline and tighten the knot. You should now have a sturdy ""crosspiece"" that runs across the front of your pelvic area. The crosspiece should be about 2 inches long with the knots toward the inside of the leg.

, Make sure that the rope sits comfortably in the small of your back, above your seat.

, Wrap the rest of the rope around your back and through the crosspiece in the same direction. Continue until you run out of webbing. Three or four wraps of rope around your waist should provide plenty of support.


Pull the rope tight, but not so tight that it constricts your movement. Try to keep the rope strands parallel – don't let them cross over and become tangled.

, Connect the short loose end that protrudes from the first bowline knot to the end of the long length of rope that you've wrapped around your waist.

, Tie overhand knots, square knots, fisherman's knots, or another sturdy knot. The goal here is to make your harness extra secure, and to provide a bit of insurance should your other knots come loose.

, Clip it as if someone walked up to you and clipped it down onto your harness – then pull the gate out front. This will make it easy to clip things into your carabiner. If you are rappelling, you want the opening end of the carabiner to lie against you, not the cliff.


Be sure to lock the carabiner. If your carabiner does not lock, then you'll need to be especially careful. Consider simply looping the climbing or rappelling rope through the crosspiece – but make sure that there are two ""points of contact.""

, Pull up on your crosspiece to make sure that it feels strong enough to hold your weight. Make sure that you cannot fit more than two fingers between your thighs and the rope loops. Tug the rope that is coiled around your waist, and ensure that it will not slip off easily. Double-check all of your knots.If you are climbing or rappelling, then the rope should have two ""points of contact"" with your harness at all times – at least two spans of rope. If you are belaying, then the carabiner should lock through two points of contact.
Be thorough! Do not put your full weight onto this harness until you are absolutely sure that it will hold up.

, Tie the climbing or rappelling rope to something that will hold your full weight without bending or breaking. Look around you for solid anchors:


Trees more than eight inches in diameter. Check that the tree is well-rooted: that it is sturdily attached to the ground, and not in loose soil.
Rocks: large, sturdy boulders and outcroppings. Do not tie your anchor to porous rock that might flake or chip away.
The frame of a vehicle. Make sure that the vehicle is in park with the parking brake on. Chock the wheels by placing rocks, bricks, or wedges to stop them from rolling."

Determine who goes first.",How to Construct a Zip Line," The distance should be anywhere from 50 feet (15.2 m) to 500 feet (152.4 m).;
, You will need enough cable so there is suitable slack when it's stretched out between the two points. This slack should form a belly in the cable between the points. You never want to stretch the cable too tight. This creates a dangerous situation of speed and crashing at the other end, and your last words will be, ""Hey, watch this!"" before you're taken to the hospital.

, If you are attaching to a tree, wrap the cable around the tree a few times and then clamp the free end to the leading end. Use high quality clamps that are sized for the cable diameter. These clamps will require you to tighten with a socket set. Two clamps six inches apart are good. Three or four clamps add the necessary safety. The other end of the cable is where you will tighten it up and raise it off the ground.

, Attach the winch to this clamp and to a point on the tree. Winch the cable up. Once it's winched up, the free end of the cable can be wrapped around the tree and then clamped on its leading end to hold it in place. Try to have the clamps about 8-feet from the tree. At this point the winch can be taken off the first clamp and then reinstalled on the furthest out permanent cable clamp. This allows for adjustments to be made on the cable. As the cable stretches, it will need to be tightened with the winch.

, This is a nerve-wracking decision. Testing the zip line is important.

Stretch yourself and loosen up.,
Find a short wall to practice on.,
Grab the top of the wall.,
Place your feet on the wall.,
Push and pull yourself upward.,
Go over the wall.,
Circle your back leg forwards.,
Find two walls that are close together.,
Place the hand and foot of each side of your body onto one wall.,
Move one hand or foot up at a time.",How to Climb a Wall," Climbing a wall can strain a number of your muscles that you may not have stressed much before. Perform some light exercise and stretch before attempting the wall climb.;
, Try to find one that is low enough that your hands can reach over the top of the wall while your feet are still on the ground, but one that is also high enough that your arms will have to be extended to reach the top. Make sure you can grip the wall appropriately. A highly slick or polished surface is not ideal for practice.

, Use both hands, and attempt to get as much of your palm on to the top of the wall as you can.Even though your feet remain on the ground, it should appear that you are dangling by your arms. They must remain extended as you grasp the wall.

, One foot should be high--nearly to the height of your waist--while the other should remain eighteen inches below that. Keep your feet underneath you, not spread out to the sides. Your toes and the front of your feet should be flexing so that they are in contact with the wall surface.

, This should appear as one fluid motion. First push yourself up with your legs, and then pull yourself up with your arms.


Push into the wall with your legs. Your body should be parallel to the wall at first, and this would seem to be pushing you away. However, your arms are holding your close, so all momentum that pushed you away from the wall will also force you up.
Just as you are beginning to develop momentum with your leg push, begin to pull with your upper body.

, As you are pulling yourself over the top edge of the wall, kick your back leg out and bring your upper body over the top of the wall. Continue this move until your center of gravity (in your lower torso) over the edge of the wall.

, Get your first leg over the wall, and then finish the climb.You can also swing one of your legs upwards right under your body followed by the other leg.If you are on a roof now, stand up. If you are instead climbing a free-standing wall, you can slide over it and pull your feet underneath you as you come down on the other side.f

, In many cities, it is common to find two buildings separated by only a narrow alley. The ideal distance would be a little greater than the distance between your elbows when you extent both of your arms out to the side.

, Your left hand and foot will go to one wall, while your right hand and foot will go to the other.Apply pressure to both walls simultaneously in order to hold up your body's weight.

, As you do so, you will have to increase the pressure you apply with the other hand or foot that is on that particular wall.

Place one hand at about chin-nose height.,
Pull your arm down so that your hand is around nipple height.

,
Once your highest hand is at step 3, repeat steps 2-3 with your other arm, ""walking"" up the rope.

",How to Climb a Rope with Just Your Arms," Place one hand below the other, knuckles facing away from you, and elbows bent so both arms are parallel to your chest. (It doesn't matter if you've jumped into this position or are standing on the ground either way, it's exactly the same);
, Have your arm still parallel to your chest.

Go climbing!",How to Get Fit for Climbing,";
, Remember that your lower body (i.e. legs) strength is, if anything, even more important than your upper body strength. You propel yourself up the wall with your legs, and reliance on upper body strength leads to sloppy technique. Squats, particularly one-legged squats, should feature heavily in any weights workout.

,,, Buy or build grip exercisers and learn to use them.

, Not only will a cardio routine burn fat turning you into a leaner, more fit athlete, but a cardio routine will also increase your endurance.

,, These help build strength and balance.

, Learning to move precisely and gracefully will pay big dividends once you start climbing.

, Your body needs high-quality food to operate at peak performance. Minimize junk food in your diet and increase protein and vegetable intake (see warnings below!) to provide the nutrients your body needs to build muscle and bone mass. Include healthy, slow-burning carbs like rice, oats and sweet potatoes to provide energy during your workouts.

, The best training for rock climbing is...you guessed it! Rock climbing.

Understand the purpose of a concealed weapon license.,
Determine whether you meet the eligibility requirements.,
Demonstrate proficiency with your weapon.,
Submit your application.,
Include payment for your license.,
Wait for approval.,
Know where concealed carry is illegal.",How to Buy a Gun in Florida1," In Florida, most forms of open carry (that is, openly brandishing or displaying your firearm in public) are illegal unless the gun owner is participating in certain legal activities (like target shooting, performing military/police work, and so on). To be able to carry a gun on one's person for personal protection, it's necessary to have a concealed weapon license. Carrying a concealed gun without this license is a crime that can potentially result in a felony.


Note that, in Florida, the concealed weapon license also certifies you to carry certain other weapons besides guns, including knives, billy clubs, tear gas guns, and other weapons.;
, Florida's Concealed Weapon License has requirements that are slightly more restrictive than those to simply purchase a firearm. The main requirements are:You must be 21 years old.
You must be able to demonstrate competency with your firearm.
Except in certain cases (such as if you are a member of the armed forces), you must be able to prove that you reside in the United States.
You must not have certain crimes or demerits on your official record, including but not limited to: felony convictions, two DUIs in the last three years, a violent misdemeanor conviction in the last three years, evidence of substance abuse, dishonorable discharge from the armed forces, evidence of domestic violence.

, The biggest difference between the requirements for buying a Handgun and those for obtaining a concealed weapon license is that the applicant must provide proof of competency with their weapon. There are a number of officially-recognized ways to prove this, including:Completing a state hunter education course
Completing a National Rifle Association training course
Completing a firearms safety course by any certified law enforcement agency or educational organization
Completing a firearms safety course as part of job training (e.g., for police and security work)

, The application for the concealed weapon license can be viewed and downloaded from the official website of the Florida Department of Agriculture. The application can be completed at home and mailed in with all required documentation or via an in-person appointment at one of eight regional offices located throughout Florida — the addresses of these offices are also available online.In addition to your completed application, you must also include a color photograph and a legible record of your fingerprints (submitted electronically via your local law enforcement agency)., Don't forget to include a payment of $112 for first-time applicants ($70 for processing the application, $42 for processing the fingerprints) with your application. License renewal is $60 and replacement/duplicate licenses are $15.


Note that several exceptions to this fee structure exist: for instance, if you have already submitted your fingerprints electronically, you don't need to pay the $42 fee, and if you are a consular security official, you will be subjected to additional fees — consult the official application fee instructions for more information., Once you've completed and submitted your application, all you need to do is wait! Your application will be reviewed by the state licensing agency, and, if it is approve, you will receive your license shortly. While you wait, you may want to use the official Florida licensing website to monitor your progress online., Once you receive your concealed carry license, you are legally allowed to carry your firearm with you for personal protection purposes in Florida and are not required to disclose this information. Note, however, that there are certain places where it is illegal to bring a firearm even if you have a valid concealed weapon permit. These include:Courtrooms
School campuses
Police stations
Polling places
Most government buildings
Airports
Any place where federal law prohibits guns

Verify that you meet Florida's criteria for buying a long gun.,
Visit a federally-licensed dealer to buy the gun.,
Complete the background check form.,
Wait for the firearms dealer to complete the background check.",How to Buy a Gun in Florida2," Like buying alcohol, smoking tobacco, voting, or driving a car, purchasing a long gun (a long-barreled gun braced against the shoulder, like a shotgun, rifle, etc.) is legally off-limits to certain categories of people in the state of Florida. While most law-abiding adults will have no problem meeting these qualifications, if you don't, you can't legally purchase a gun — no exceptions. The basic requirements are:


You must be at least 18 years of age.
You must not be a convicted felon.
You must not have a history of mental illness.You must not have a record of domestic violence.You must not abuse drugs or alcohol.
Note, however, that it is legal to possess and use a gun from age 16 onward (and at younger ages with adult supervision) for certain legal activities (hunting, target shooting, etc.).

, The state of Florida does not require firearms dealers to carry a state license. However, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) still requires gun sellers to obtain a federal-level license.Refer to a Florida city phone book or, alternatively, perform an internet search to locate a firearms dealer in your area.
Don't forget to bring current, valid identification (such as your Florida driver's license) with you to the firearms dealer to prove your age and identity. The name and address on your identification must be current.

, After selecting the gun you want to buy, the firearms dealer will provide you with a form to complete that they will then use in conducting the background check with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. This part of the process is required for every purchase — you can buy as many guns as you wish at once, but each time you make a new purchase, you'll need to complete another background check form.


The background check form will ask you to provide basic personal information including your name, date of birth, contact information, and more.
Note that possession of a concealed weapons permit from Florida or any other state does not exempt you from the background check.

, After receiving the completed form, the dealer will call the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to receive an instant background check based on the information you provided. If you pass this check (in other words, if your official records don't contain evidence of mental illness, domestic violence, felony convictions, etc.), you will be approved and you may purchase your gun.


Note that some firearms dealers may require you to pay an eight dollar fee for the background check.

"
"
Be 21 years old in addition to the long gun criteria.,
Buy your gun through a licensed dealer as normal.,
Wait 72 hours to receive your gun.",How to Buy a Gun in Florida3," In Florida, the process of purchasing a Handgun is slightly more regulated than the process of purchasing a long gun. In addition to meeting all the restrictive criteria for buying a long gun, a person who wants to purchase a Handgun must also be 21 years old — not 18.


Technically, a Handgun is a firearm designed to be held and fired with one or both hands (not against the shoulder like a rifle). This includes most semiautomatic pistols and revolvers.

, Just as with long guns, the State of Florida doesn't require any sort of special license or permit to sell hand guns commercially. However, the same federal licensing rules apply as with long guns, so only purchase from dealers that are licensed by the ATF.


Additionally, hand guns require the same background check as with long guns. This is true regardless of whether the purchaser has a concealed license permit from Florida or any other state.

, Florida is one of ten states that imposes waiting periods on people who wish to buy guns — however, unlike certain other states, in Florida, the waiting period only applies to handguns. After the completion of a background check, the purchaser must wait three days (72 hours) to be able to receive their gun. This law is designed to prevent impulsive acts of violence like suicide and murder by giving potential perpetrators a chance to ""cool down"" before they get potentially lethal firepower.Note that weekends and legal holidays do not count as part of the 72-hour waiting period — only business days.
Note also that there are two major exceptions to this rule: you are not required to wait 72 hours for your gun if you have a permit that allows you to carry concealed weapons or if you are trading in a handgun."

Consider buying a rope bag or stuff sack.,
Stack the rope.,
Hold both ends of the rope together.Move your hands 2 to 3 arm-lengths up the rope, letting the loose ends dangle together.

,
Hold both strands of rope in your right hand and spread both arms out to the side.,
Drape the resulting arm-length of rope across your shoulders.,
Grab the slack.,
Keep your left hand in place as you spread your arms again, pulling up another arm length of climbing rope.,
Hold onto both strands of rope with your right hand as you reach across with your left to pull up another arms-length of rope from the stack.,
Continue draping each arms-length of rope across your shoulders, behind your neck, until you run out of rope.

,
Loop the coils.,
Locate the middle of the bundle of coils.,
Collect the 2 trailing, separate ends of rope you left when you first started pulling arm-lengths of rope.,
Feed a loop of slack through the loop in your dominant hand.,
Tie the bundle shut.,
Consider making a rope backpack.",How to Coil a Climbing Rope," Many rope bags include a hole in the bottom: tie one end of the rope so that it will not pull through the hole. To pack up your rope, simply stuff the rope into the bag. Be sure to keep one end free so that you can easily find it when you're climbing; consider tying it to an outside strap of the sack.
, That is, run it through your hands and stack it in an orderly pile so it's less likely to get tangled during the coiling process. Leave the bottom end of the rope sticking out from the bottom of the rope pile.

,, Once your arms are spread, grasp both strands of rope in your left hand, too.

, Hold one end of the rope in your dominant hand. Take your other hand, and run it along the length from your dominant hand, over your shoulder and behind your neck, and down your straight non-dominant arm. The rope should hang on your neck like a dirty, heavy scarf.

, Hold onto both strands of rope with your left hand as you reach across with your right hand, grasping both strands between your left hand and the stack of rope coils. Then, take the hand opposite from the slack and grab the slack, then do the same flip over your head and onto your shoulders. Continue this way until you have the entire rope going back and forth across your shoulders and arms and looping through your hands each time.


Be sure to leave at least two feet of slack. If you want to carry the coil as a ""rope pack"", leave five to ten feet of slack

, Drape this length of rope across your shoulders, behind your neck.

, Make sure you continue working with both strands at once.

,, When you are almost done, and you've left 6-10 feet of slack rope, grab the entire bundle behind your neck; pull it up and over so that you have all your rope in front of you.


Pull the coils off your shoulders, holding them together so you don't drop any strands of rope.
Bring your hands together, take the two bundles of rope, and put them together in one big loop.
You should be holding a loose coil in one hand: an upside down U shape of all your rope with loops on the ends of the U. Hold that loop in one hand (probably your dominant one) while you bring the whole bundle back over your head.

, Hold the bundle here, so each end of the coils drapes down on either side.

, Wrap both ends of the rope around the bundle you made, below where your hand grips the coils, cinching each wrap tight. You should be able to just hold the whole bundle by the slack now.


The bottom of the coil may look a bit untidy but that doesn't matter as long as the top is tight and orderly.

, Leave yourself approximately three feet of rope, and let whichever hand is holding the U-shape grab the remaining end. Let go of the bundle, and pull the end through at the same time, without letting go with the other hand. Bring the end of the rope through its own loop at the top of the bundle, creating a half hitch around the top of the bundle. Reach through the hole you left, between the ""top"" of the folded coil bundle and the wraps you just made. Grasp the trailing sections of rope near the bundle and pull them both partway through the hole, creating a loop.


Feed the slack around the big loop a few times, bundling it all together so it looks like a really thick noose. Wrap it at least five times, but probably no more than ten. It is up to you how much you want to wrap, and if you need more room, unwind the end in the loop to give you more room.
Take a loop of the slack and put it through the noose's loop; feed the rest of the slack through its own loop, crochet-stitch style.

, Slide the loop over the top of the coiled climbing rope, so this loop lies over the other wraps you just made. Then pull on the loose ends of the rope to cinch it down, effectively tying the bundle shut.


The rope should be ready to carry. Slide it into your backpack or a stuff sack, or hanging it from your harness. Make sure that the rope is secure.

, If you leave a longer tail of slack, you can make a pseudo-backpack with the rope ends tied back into the bundle. This may make for easier carrying if an actual backpack in unavailable, or if you want to put your climbing partner to work. Swing the whole thing onto your back and take the two pieces of slack and put one over each shoulder, then cross them across your chest. Put them under your arms and then around the back of the coil on your back, then back out around your waist. Tie a square knot to keep the coil in place.

This is especially useful if the rope gets damp from snow. Never climb when it is raining, or has rained! Rock is more likely to break if it is wet, because it has all the extra weight from the water.
If you have all the gear in your pack (crampons, backup rope, shoes, anchors, belay devices, carabiners, quick-draws, and trad gear) your partner can just sling the rope on his/her back, and off you go!

First, identify the building you want to climb.,
Check for climbing holds.,
Find a good starting point.,
Follow your route.,
Stay safe.",How to Climb Buildings," Be sure that it has a safe, sturdy structure, such as stone. Understand that you may need to find a different one if it appears unsteady or dangerous at all. Check to see if people are around, as they may discourage you from climbing or call the police.;
, Scan the building for drain pipes or solid ledges that can hold your weight. When climbing, you will need to find safe handholds and footholds that you can grip. If the building has too few, you may need to search for another one to climb.

, Search for a spot where there are the most climbing holds above you. Plan a route that takes you to your destination, as well as a method for entering the desired place whether it be through the roof or an open window. Once you have figured out a plan, begin at a starting point, such as a sturdy drain pipe.

, Use climbing holds, such as pipes and window ledges, to follow the path leading to your destination. If you find that you have to change your plans halfway through, find safe holds to grip onto as you move up the building. Be sure that you avoid touching slippery substances that might cause you to lose your grip.

, If you find that your route is too dangerous or difficult, you may need to restart your progress. Understand that your first priority is your safety. Sometimes, you have to start over before you can succeed. Find a better path to take in order to safely reach your destination.

All applicants must score at least 80% on this portion of the exam as well., You must have a license to own and register a firearm and to buy ammunition. You must renew your license every 5 years for as long as you possess firearms in Canada. Your safety course instructor can usually provide you with the application form, but you can also get it online. It is called the CAFC 921E / RCMP 5592 form.You'll need to provide proof of identity. Valid types of identification are federal, provincial, territorial or municipal employee identification cards, a passport, a birth certificate, citizenship certificate, or permanent resident document.
A Minors' License can enable a 12-17 year old to borrow a non-restricted rifle or shotgun for approved purposes (hunting or target shooting, for example). Applicants must take Canadian Firearms Safety Course and pass the exam., A variety of background checks are done when processing a firearms license application.

, That's a Federal Firearm Licensed dealer. If you are purchasing from anyone else, you will need the permit unless you have a concealed pistol license(CPL).If you are a CPL holder and are purchasing from another person all you need is a RI-60. This is also called a license to purchase a pistol, or an LTP. It is valid for 30 days as of December 18th, 2012.


Complete the application for a pistol purchase permit at your local police agency. If you reside within municipal limits, go to your city police department. If you live in a rural area or outside municipal limits, go to your county sheriff's department.
Bring valid identification with you. You must present police with a current ID that shows your photograph.

, It's not super invasive -- they're mainly checking to see if you're mentally stable or if you have any restraining orders to your name.This generally takes 24 hours.


Take an oath before a notary public. You must swear that you comply with applicable federal laws and Michigan state laws for owning a pistol in Michigan. The laws stipulate numerous circumstances that prohibit applicants from receiving a purchase permit. You can see the complete list at the Michigan State Police website at www.michigan.gov/msp.
As of last year, the Basic Pistol Safety Questionnaire is no longer given. Just for the record.

, You can usually get the permit the day after you apply. The police can only deny the permit if you've been convicted of a felony or have displayed a history of violent or mentally unstable behavior.


You'll also receive a PSR -- Pistol Sales Record in triplicate. One will be for you, one will be for the police, and one will be for your seller. Don't lose these!

, The dealer's identification number must be on the PSR in addition to information on you and your pistol. You must send the completed police copy of the PSR to the nearest police agency.


This goes for both those who are purchasing from private sellers and those purchasing from FFL's. The only difference is that if you are purchasing from a private seller and do not have a permit, the PSR will be given to you then. Otherwise, go to your local police station and request a PSR form in triplicate.

, The permit is valid for 30 days, but you need to fill it out within 10 days of purchase. When you are buying your pistol, have the forms with you to fill out.


Make sure that you and your gun dealer sign the permit and PSR. This will be done when you buy the pistol. The dealer will retain a copy of each.

Keep a copy of the signed purchase permit and PSR for your records.

You must be at least 18 years old to buy a long gun from a federal firearms licensed dealer.

Non-residents may purchase a long gun in Michigan and residents of Michigan may purchase a long gun in any other state., You can't buy a long gun if doing so is prohibited due to your mental health background or criminal history. If you do not have a permit to carry a pistol, you may have to go through this. However, it's ultimately up to the discretion of the dealer.


You may find that this lack of regulation is surprising, at least compared to the regulations for handguns. The reason being is that long guns are very difficult to conceal, aren't often used in crime, and aren't cheap to come by.

, It's best to go about this as legally as possible -- purchasing from an FFL dealer, etc. But there are also private gun shows and tons of Internet sites that have a wide selection, too.

Visit a licensed and registered firearms dealer in the state of Virginia if you are over the age of 18.;
,
Determine the firearm you want to purchase.,
Discuss your firearm selection with the dealer and provide 2 proofs of identity.,
Agree to a background check by signing the necessary consent form.

,
Pay a small processing fee if you are a Virginia resident.,
Wait for the dealer to enter your information in the computerized National Instant Background Check System (NICS).",How to Buy a Firearm in Virginia,", The Virginia age requirement for purchase of handguns is 21, and 18 for rifles and shotguns. If you want to purchase more than one firearm in one month, you must apply for a Multiple Handgun Purchase Certificate with the Virginia State Police first. ** the multiple purchase law has been repealed, as of Feb 29, 2012.

,


The main proof of identity must be an unexpired vehicle operator's license with photo or any other identification that has been provided by the government.
The ancillary means of identification must match the identity of the person that appears on the photo ID. An example of an acceptable ancillary form of ID is a current passport, a utility bill, or a current voter registration card.

,, The fee is slightly higher for out-of-state residents.

, If the dealer does not have access to the Internet, the dealer will call NICS directly. NICS will investigate your criminal history (if any) in as little as 2 minutes by accessing state and national criminal databases. If approved, the purchase of the firearm will be completed. If you do not receive approval, the purchase will be delayed until further review of your profile.

Pick up your gun.,
Acquaint yourself with Wisconsin gun laws.",How to Buy a Firearm in Wisconsin," Handguns are ideal for self- or home defense. They can be brought to bear quickly on intruders. If you want a weapon that can fill multiple roles, a shotgun probably is right for you. Rifles are best for hunters.


Revolvers: Revolvers use a cylinder that rotates each time the weapon is fired, putting a fresh round in the chamber. They are simple to operate and seldom jam, but can be difficult to reload.
Pistols: Semi-automatic handguns generally hold more bullets than revolvers. They rest in a magazine, or clip, that the user slides into the weapon. A spring mechanism ejects each spent cartridge and loads the next round into the chamber.
Shotguns: Shotguns often are used in hunting and sport shooting, but also are effective weapons for home defense. They fire shells that can either disperse pellets or individual lead slugs. They can be single-action, pump- or bolt-action, or semi-automatic. Single-action shotguns must be reloaded after each use. Pump- and bolt-action shotguns hold multiple shells that must be ejected from the chamber manually. Semi-automatic shotguns work much like pistols. In general, shotguns are more powerful than handguns. They're also easier to use and have a wider range of uses.
Rifles: Rifles fire high-velocity rounds at distances of several hundred yards. They are best for long-range shooting, and therefore aren't practical for most people.;
, Most gun stores will let you fire several guns before you make your purchase. Ask the dealer to help you find one that meets your needs. Make sure you can lift the weapon easily and withstand its recoil when you fire it.

, Federal law prohibits certain individuals from possessing firearms. You cannot own a gun if you meet any of the following conditions:


Are not at least 18 years old to purchase a long gun; 21 to buy a handgun.
Are a convicted felon.
Were convicted of a misdemeanor of domestic-violence.
Are subject of a restraining order.
Were dishonorably discharged from a branch of the U.S. Armed Forces.
Are living in the United States unlawfully.
Are mentally disabled.

, In Wisconsin, a buyer must show a valid Wisconsin driver's license or state-issued ID card with a current, valid address to the gun dealer.

, After the dealer accepts your information, you will be required to carry out the following:


Complete Form 4473, the questions on this form will show the dealer you are buying from that you can lawfully and legally possess the firearm you are intending to purchase. If you are purchasing a handgun you will also need to fill out the state background check form in addition to the Federal Form 4473.
Dealer will submit your information to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System for a long gun purchase. If purchasing a handgun they will use the state background check form and submit it to WI DOJ (Wisconsin Dept Of Justice.) via their website or phone.
There is no waiting period for long guns or handguns in the State of Wisconsin. To qualify for a concealed-weapons permit in Wisconsin, prospective gun owners must meet all the conditions set forth by state and federal laws and must complete a 1-day gun-safety training course.

, After the dealer gets the background check approval, you may take possession of your firearms.

, Wisconsin's gun-control laws are different from other states. Wisconsin residents can carry concealed weapons beginning Nov. 1, 2011. Wisconsin prohibits having a weapon in or near any of the following:


Secure area of an airport.
A courthouse or any other area that posts the prohibition of firearms at the site.
School zones.
Anywhere while you're under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

Build your team.,
Survey the culture of the team.,
Look for a local rock climbing gym that offers team building events.,
Meet with the team before you book the rock climbing session.,
Plan a 4 to 5 hour session with a break for lunch in the middle, provided by the company.,
Ask the employees to sign waivers for the company and the rock climbing gym.",How to Use Rock Climbing as a Team Building Event1," Decide who is included in the team. In large corporations, this may not include the whole company, but rather departments who work together as a unit.;
, If the team is fairly young, generally fit and ambitious, then rock climbing is a great activity for them. If you have any disabled, overweight or chronically ill members of staff, then you should avoid this as a team building activity and choose something that is less physically demanding, such as board games or a scavenger tour of the local area.

, The leaders of the event should be able to speak with you and establish goals for the day. Since they are the experts in rock climbing, they will be leading a session where the primary goal is to develop team confidence rather than exercise.


You may want to compare rates for local gyms that offer this. It can be expensive, since a section of the rock climbing gym will need to be reserved for the duration of the event, and the gym will lose out on money from members and other climbers.
Look for a program that includes communication and listening skills, conflict resolution, trust building, confidence building, increasing motivation, stress reduction, creating roles, achieving goals and building time management skills.

, Encourage them to be excited, but tell them to come to you, or management, with any doubts they have. You may find hidden disabilities will prevent others from taking part in the activity.


If everyone cannot do the rock climbing session together it will not be a useful team-building adventure. Exclusion may lead to office problems or other team problems, such as feelings of discrimination in the future.

, This amount of time will seem like a nice adventure without being tedious.

, Make sure they read them well and know the company is not responsible for any activity that includes horseplay or is deemed unsafe at the gym.

Begin your day in a conference room setting, whether it is at the office or in a private office at the rock climbing gym.,
Ask the employees to pair up.,
Institute new challenges, such as sending and receiving messages, where employees must tell another employee how to get to a new place, or climbers can be tethered together or race.,
Take pictures, cheer and encourage laughter.",How to Use Rock Climbing as a Team Building Event2," Ask the rock climbing instructor to go through the rules and establish the plan for the day. Then allow your team to talk and establish common goals, such as the following decisions:


Establish the team goals for the day. This can be a fun goal or a serious challenge. Perhaps the group will decide to climb a total distance, when all their rock climbing heights are added together. This should usually be done in combination with your office manager and the leader at the rock climbing gym. Many managers prefer not to take the role as the leader, but to work along as a single team member.
Decide the barriers to achieving the goals. Point out potential holes, so that they can be foreseen and met with good solutions along the way.
The Adventure Associates company advocates a ""challenge by choice"" approach to rock climbing. They ask people to be honest about their physical abilities and reach for goals that are reasonable. This relieves pressure that all employees must achieve the same level.
Make sure the team has made a commitment to turn off outside distractions, such as cell phones, and be totally dedicated to the task. Rock climbing can be dangerous if people are distracted, so make sure everyone promises dedication to completing the day's goals.

, The rock climbing instructor may choose to do this based on ability. There should be an attempt made to work with new associates in order to encourage trust in new colleagues.


One employee will be harnessed in and the other employee will be belaying and observing the person. They can pull on the rope to ensure the climber has extra support if it is needed. The rest of the employees will encourage the climber to reach their chosen goal.
Each employee will take their turn being tethered and climbing, with their belaying partner below. This will encourage patience, communication and confidence.

, Make sure these are instituted with the team's agreement ahead of time.

, Give your employees time to talk about their day and possibly a reward, for the goals they achieved. After the team building exercise is done, publish the goals in a newsletter or email, touting the challenges faced and accomplished throughout the day.

Know the difference between hard and soft body armor.,
Know the available levels of protection.,
As do the plates in Level III and IV bulletproof vests, they add weight and bulk to the vest, reducing mobility; they can, however, be worn under clothing.,
Decide whether or not you want a concealable vest.,
Choose a vest that fits you.,
Choose relevant add-ons.,
Consider your budget.",How to Buy a Bulletproof Vest," Hard body armor uses plates of metal or ceramic material to stop anything up to a rifle bullet or shotgun slug. Soft body armor uses layers of special fabrics to catch the bullet in flight and disperse the force of its impact. Soft body armor can stop bullets from most handguns, shotgun pellets (up to 12-gauge 00 buckshot), and blunt shrapnel.


Hard body armor plates are made of steel, ceramic, or polyethylene. They are highly resistant to impact along the face of the plate, but, especially in the case of non-metallic plates, they are vulnerable to blows along their edges, requiring careful packing when shipped.
Soft body armor is made from woven aramid fibers such as Kevlar or Twaron, or resin-impregnated parallel or cross-plied polyethylene fibers such as Spectra or Dyneema. The newer polyethylene fibers are as impact-resistant as the older aramid fibers while being lighter in weight, but they are more vulnerable to environmental degradation. Currently, experiments are being performed with carbon nanotubes as a possible material for bullet-resistant vests, and there are also experiments using gel-like fluids in conjunction with existing fibers to provided added protection at the site of impact.;
, Bulletproof vests are rated according to the amount of blunt force impact they are capable of stopping. Levels of protection currently available include the following:


Level II-A vests are the thinnest available. Generally 4 mm (0.16 inches) thick and made of soft materials, they are designed to be worn under clothing for long periods of time.
Level II bullet-resistant vests are generally 5 mm (0.2 inches) thick. They are the vests most commonly worn by patrol officers. They can either be worn concealed under a loose-fitting shirt or over clothing.
Level III-A vests are 8 to 10 mm (0.32 to 0.4 inches) thick. Heavier and stiffer than Level II-A and Level II vests, they are designed to stop heavier-grain bullets, such as those from a .44 Magnum, and rapid-fire attacks, such as those from a 9-mm submachine gun. They are designed to handle minor combat situations but can still be worn under clothing if need be.
Level III and Level IV vests incorporate 10- by 12-inch (25- by 30-cm) armor plates ranging from 1/2 to 3/4 inch (6 to 25 mm) in thickness to cover the chest and back. Each plate adds 4 to 9 pounds (1.8 to 4.1 kg) to the 3 to 5 pounds (1.36 to 2.27 kg) that the soft body armor vests weigh and reduce the wearer's mobility accordingly. These vests cannot be worn under clothing and are the kind normally worn by SWAT officers.
Stab-resistant vests use armor plates similar to those in Level III and Level IV armor plate vests. (These vests are worn by corrections personnel to protect against being stabbed by prisoners with smuggled-in and improvised knives and stilettos.) Stab-resistant vests are rated according to the energy of impact they can deflect. Levels of protection currently available include the following 3 Levels and are tested to protect against Stab Pressure with the penetration Limit of 0.28"" / 7mm: Level 1 - Protects against pressure of 24 Joules (J), Level 2 - Protects against pressure of 33 Joules (J), Level 3 - Protects against pressure of 43 Joules (J).

, Pending the outcome of further research, the plates may be replaced with the gel-like fluids described above.


Some bullet-resistant vests are designed to allow the wearer to insert additional armor plates to add layers of protection. These vests can accommodate armor plates to make a vest stab-resistant as well as bullet-resistant, as soft body armor can protect only against slashing knife attacks, not stabbings.

, Level II and Level II-A vests can be concealed under a thick, loose shirt or a thinner dress shirt and undershirt. Level III-A vests may require a sweater or suit jacket to be concealed effectively. However, Level III and Level IV vests require at least a heavy jacket or sweater to be concealed or a battle dress uniform, and they are usually worn over clothing.


A vest worn under clothing is often white in color, so that it can be mistaken for an undershirt if you normally wear your shirt with the top button unbuttoned. A vest worn over clothing is usually dark in color.

, A bulletproof vest should fit you reasonably comfortably. Too large a vest will be ill-fitting and tend to slip, while too small a vest may expose vital organs to injury. Some manufacturers make bullet-resistant vests only in standard sizes, which may be a problem if you buy online and can't be fitted before you buy.

, Body armor protects the torso - front and back only. If you want to protect your shoulders, neck, sides or groin, you’ll need an add-on.


There are many aftermarket and official add-ons that fit some or most body armors manufactured today.
Add-ons will anchor to the vest and protect different parts of the body. There are extra defenses for the shoulders (Shoulder guards), the abdomen (Side protection), the neck (Gorget, or Neck guard) and groin (Groin flap).
Make sure that the add-ons you buy will anchor to your basic vest. Also make sure they can be fitted snugly to your body, so they will not constrict your movement.

, Not only do additional layers of protection add weight to the bulletproof vest, they also add to its cost. However, some body armor dealers resell used police vests to private security and civilians.


Used body armor has been tested by the National Institute of Justice and found to be as bullet-resistant as new armor. Aramid fibers such as Kevlar and Twaron last for many years; however, the fabric in the outer shell carrier may wear out faster in a used vest than a new vest. You'll also have to replace the elastic in the carrier sooner in a used vest than a new one.
Some dealers offer volume discounts for multiple purchases, which may be important if you're outfitting a mall security force or group of bodyguards.
Consider the guarantee offered by the seller, as well as the manufacturer's warranty.

In Texas, one private individual is allowed to sell a gun to another private individual, without further licensing, as long as each of them is a Texas resident and each is legally allowed to own a gun.


Texas does not require a license just to own, to purchase, or to sell a gun privately. There are certain classifications of people who may not own a gun (minors, convicted felons, psychiatric patients), and it is up to the seller at least to ask if the buyer falls within one of these groups., For a private sale, in person, within the state boundaries of Texas, a license is not required.For personal safety, if you do not know the seller personally, you should take a friend along with you., A bill of sale is not required under Texas law, but it is a good idea, both for you and for the seller. A good bill of sale will include the name and address of both the seller and the buyer, along with a description of the gun and the sale price. In case the police ever show up asking about the gun, you can show by the bill of sale that you came by it lawfully, and you can identify the source.Most likely, the seller will have a bill of sale, or at least a blank form. You can find your own forms online at several sources like formsbirds.com, texasguntrader.com, or tidyforms.com.

Invest a suitable amount of time in research.,
Practice the skills you can master away from the mountain.,
Become acquainted with the various climbing styles.",How to Start Mountain Climbing1," When considering a hobby as dangerous as climbing, there is no such thing as knowing too much. Read up on everything you can, and be sure to check out as many different resources as possible. Websites, books and magazines each offer insight into the sport, as do online videos, which outline everything from basic strategy to advanced techniques.;
, Nothing can replace actually leaving the house and practicing your climbing techniques, but there are things you can do beforehand that will enhance your skill set. One example of this is learning the proper way to tie climbing knots—something you can easily do from home. More than a dozen commonly used climbing knots exist, each serving a variety of different purposes. Learning skills like these will not only make you more ready for the climb, they can also help build confidence.

, You have several to choose from, each with their share of supporters:



Traditional climbing is a freestyle option that does not offer climbers the option of anchors (devices jammed into the rock walls that help with footing).

Sport climbing is similar to traditional climbing but permits the use of anchors for ascending the rock wall.

Bouldering is an abbreviated style of climbing that sees participants climb natural or man-made boulders, often without harnesses.

Solo climbing involves undertaking a climb by oneself, with little (if any) safety gear and no anchors to rely on.

Mountaineering involves high-altitude climbs and are usually the longest and most physically demanding in the sport.

"
"
Work on your fitness level.,
Visit the closest indoor climbing gym.,
Watch and learn.,
Seek out lessons from a trained climber.",How to Start Mountain Climbing2," You may run regularly, hit the gym for a few hours a day, or find some other way to keep yourself in tip-top shape. But that may not help you with your new hobby. Tailoring a training regimen to the type of climb you plan to do can increase the chances you’ll be successful at it from the start. For short but difficult climbs, you’ll want to make sure you increase your upper-body strength. Mountaineering demands a great deal of endurance, so building strength is a must.

, The only way you’ll know for sure if this is something you want to do is to actually give it a try. Take as much time as you need the first time around; you aren’t expected to be great right away, and it may actually take several tries before you can even get halfway up the wall. A patient, open-minded approach is the only one to take when attempting a climb for the first time.

, While you’re at the climbing gym, watch how others make their way up the wall. You may learn something you can put to immediate use the next time you try. Also, try asking questions. Fellow climbers are a valuable resource—often more so than anything you’ll find online or in magazines.

, If you’re eager to get better quickly, taking lessons is certainly a viable option. Most climbing walls offer an expert who can provide knowledge, expertise, and tips on what you’re doing well and what needs to be improved. Be willing to take whatever advice the trained climber has to offer.

Ensure you have the proper equipment for a climb.,
Decide where and how you wish to climb.,
Climb that mountain.",How to Start Mountain Climbing3," This includes a good pair of climbing shoes, a rock climbing harness, climbing slings and ropes, a top-quality helmet, and chalk bags to improve grip. Several other climbing-specific items are available, but most are designed for more experienced climbers.

, The choice can actually be a difficult one, particularly if you’re looking for the right balance between something that will challenge you and something that won’t leave you feeling discouraged. The best option would be to choose a climb in which someone else will be accompanying you, both from a safety standpoint and as an opportunity to gain feedback.

, Or hill. Or rock wall. You’ve gone from thinking about it to doing it. Feel proud!

Lay out the harness on the ground to ensure that there are no twists in the leg loops or the waist belt.,
Step into the harness so that one foot is in each of the leg loops.,
Pull up the harness until the waist belt is above your hips.

,
Tighten the waist loop by pulling on the straps.,
To check to see if your harness is tight enough, try to pull it down over your hips.,
Tighten both leg loops the same way you did the waist strap.",How to Use a Harness for Rock Climbing," At the front of the harness will be where there is a loop connecting the waist to the legs.  This is called the belay loop.;
,  Make sure you also stepped through the waist belt.

,,  Newer harnesses automatically double back but many older versions need to be manually double backed.  Make sure this is done properly or else your harness may come undone while climbing.

,  If it stays on, you're good to go.

,  Leg loops should be left slightly loose so that you can still move your legs.  A good rule is to be able to fit two fingers together between the leg strap and your leg.

Prepare to break in your shoes:

This method is best for trying out a new pair of shoes.,Remove all the packaging from your shoes if they are new.,
Walk around in your shoes.,
Begin climbing lightly in your shoes.,
Gradually progress to longer climbs.,
Assess the fit of your shoes.",How to Stretch Rock Climbing Shoes1," Like any type of shoe, a new climbing shoe will break down and start molding to your foot as you begin to use it.
Breaking in your shoes takes around four or five climbing sessions, so the amount of time this method takes will depend on how frequently you climb.
Most retailers will let you return a pair of shoes as long as the rubber on the bottom of the shoe isn't worn or scratched.;
,,  This will allow the shoe to begin to conform to your foot.  Do this indoors in order to protect the rubber of the shoe.  Wear your shoes for roughly fifteen minutes before removing them to prevent blisters, then repeat.  If you are experiencing severe rubbing or blistering, wear a thin pair of socks.,  Climb only for brief intervals, primarily bouldering routes or indoor routes that can be completed in a relatively short time frame.  If you own another pair of shoes, alternate between pairs on successive climbs.  This way the shoe continues to mold properly to the shape of your foot as you climb, while you avoid developing painful blisters from over-climbing.,  As you break in your shoes, begin to climb longer and harder routes, or begin to climb multiple routes consecutively in your shoes.,  If you are still feeling discomfort after several climbing sessions, you may need to actively work to stretch the leather of your shoes using one of the later three methods, or you might consider getting a different pair of shoes. Some tips for determining if a pair of shoes is going to fit include the following:

While it's normal to have your toes slightly curled inside your shoes, if the joints of your toes hurt or your toes start to cramp, you're probably in too small of a shoe size.
The leather on top of your shoe can be stretched out, but the rubber sole cannot. Therefore, pressure points on top of your foot can be relieved, but pressure points in the heel, toe, or arch cannot.
Although a close-fitting shoe can help your climbing, remember that if discomfort from your shoes is intense enough to be distracting, it outweighs the benefits of wearing a tighter shoe.

"
Prepare to complete this method:

This method works best to slightly stretch the entire upper of your shoes.,Remove all packaging from your shoes if they are new, including stickers that may be found on the bottom of the shoes.,

Fill two separate plastic sandwich bags with water.,

Insert a bag into each shoe and loosely lace the shoes around the bags.,Place your shoes into a freezer and leave them to freeze overnight.,
Remove your shoes from the freezer and remove the bags of ice.,
Repeat this process as necessary until the desired fit is achieved.",How to Stretch Rock Climbing Shoes2,"
This method is done overnight, or over a similar 12-hour time period.
Because this method only stretches in small increments, it may need to be repeated a few times to get the desired stretch.
Assuming your shoes are in otherwise new condition, you should still be able to return your shoes after performing this method.

,,  Fill each bag to be roughly the size of your foot. Remove most of the excess air from each bag before sealing completely.,  Be sure that the shoes are laced to approximately the same tightness as they would be on your feet.,,  The water, having expanded upon freezing, should have stretched the leather of the shoes.,  Keep in mind that this method only stretches your shoes in small increments; if you need a more drastic stretch, consider one of the two later methods."
"
Prepare to complete this method:

This method works best to create a moderately large stretch in specific areas of the leather, and is good for eliminating pressure points.,
Gather pieces of fabric.,

Stuff each shoe as tightly as possible with fabric.,

Heat one shoe with a blow dryer on low to medium heat.,

Massage and flex the shoe thoroughly.,Repeat this heating process for the other shoe.,
Remove the fabric and put on your shoes as they cool.",How to Stretch Rock Climbing Shoes3,"
The method itself takes roughly 15-20 minutes, but if possible, plan so that you can climb within half an hour after finishing.
Depending on the extent of the stretching, you may not be able to return your shoes after performing this method.

, Socks, washcloths, or fabric remnants work well.  Any type of fabric may be used as long as it is small enough to stuff into a shoe., Be sure to pack in the fabric in tighter areas of the shoe such as the toes and heels.,  Heat the shoe for around a minute, or until the entire shoe feels warm to the touch.

You're extremely unlikely to melt the rubber on your shoes with a hairdryer, but for safety's sake, avoid using high heat, and if your shoe becomes too hot to hold comfortably, turn the heat down.

,  Reach inside the shoe to press the fabric more firmly against any specific tight areas or pressure points.,, Having your feet in your shoes prevents the leather from shrinking back down as it cools and helps the leather mold the shape of your foot. If possible, go climbing before the shoes cool completely."
"
Prepare to complete this method:

This method is best for achieving a large stretch throughout the entire upper of the shoe, and does the best job of helping the shoes mold to your individual feet.,Remove all packaging from your shoes, including any stickers that may be on the bottoms of the shoes.,
Wearing your shoes, get into a hot shower.,
Get out of the shower and walk around in your shoes while they are still wet.,
If possible, climb in your shoes before they dry completely.,
Evaluate the fit of your shoes and repeat as necessary.",How to Stretch Rock Climbing Shoes4,"
You should only need to remain in the shower for a few minutes, but it will take a few hours for your shoes to dry.
You will most likely not be able to return your shoes after performing this method.

,,  Stay in the shower long enough for the shoes to become thoroughly soaked.

Know that when your shoes get wet, the dye may bleed.

,  Walk indoors to protect the soles of the shoes.  Wiggle your toes as you walk to help stretch the leather.  Wait to remove your shoes until they feel like they are beginning to dry.,  This does not have to be immediate, as it will take a few hours for the leather to completely dry.  This will help the shoe mold to your foot as you climb.,  If you still experience discomfort or pressure points, you may need to stretch your shoes again."

There's no need to invest in a whole rock-climbing wardrobe, especially if you're just trying out a local climbing gym.Your clothes should fit well (you can't adjust a shoulder strap during a climb), but loosely enough to allow for full range of motion.


If you are wearing long trousers or long sleeves, they should fit fairly close at ankles and wrists.
Wear moisture-wicking fabrics to avoid chafing and other skin irritations.
While some people are fine wearing shorts for indoor climbing, keep in mind that the harness can cause them to ride up. For modesty reasons, you may prefer ¾ length or capri length pants, or leggings with shorts over them.
Climbing shoes are recommended, but in most gyms regular sneakers or running shoes will work as well. Many gyms also allow you to rent shoes, in addition to other gear.;
, If you have no experience rock climbing, bouldering may be less intimidating for you. This style of climbing involves shorter walls, and doesn't require you to use any harnesses or other equipment.The floors below bouldering walls are covered with thick padding to protect you if you fall.
Because of the lack of equipment, bouldering can be a great introduction to the sport of rock climbing and allow you to work into more advanced climbing at your own pace.
Bouldering also may be more attractive to you if you're afraid of heights.

, Most climbing gyms offer a training course to teach you knots and equipment use, as well as provide you with vital safety information. You may be required to pass a basic safety test before you're allowed to climb.Many of these lessons relate to belaying. If you're just going bouldering, you'll probably still have a minimal amount of instruction before they let you loose on the wall.
Read any materials you're given carefully, and pay attention to the gym staff as they explain equipment and techniques to you. Speak up if you have any questions or concerns, and don't worry about sounding stupid. The staff knows you're there to learn, and much of rock climbing's safety relies on communication and trust between climbers.
Practice knots and get familiar with the gear before you start climbing. If you feel uncomfortable in the harness, speak to someone on staff about adjusting it.

, Like any sport or discipline, rock climbing uses a lot of words and phrases that may be completely unfamiliar to you. Additionally, you may hear words you know that are used in a different way to mean something specifically related to rock climbing.If you don't understand something, or if it doesn't seem to make sense in the context, ask what it means. Gym staff understand that you're a beginner, and will be more than happy to ""translate"" or define unfamiliar terms.
For example, you may be familiar with the word send in other contexts, but in rock climbing it means that you've climbed a route from the ground up without falling. If you do that on your first try, that's called a flash.
When climbers or gym staff talk about beta, they're referring to the basic information about a climb, such as its difficulty, style, or length, along with advice on how to complete it successfully. The beta helps you plan mentally for your climb before you begin your ascent.
If you hear someone talking about ""rock shoes,"" they're referring to specific, light climbing shoes with smooth soles made of sticky rubber for extra grip on the footholds., The holds on rock climbing gym walls are marked with colored tape to identify the route. Each of these routes is graded using a standard grading system, so you can pick a route that best corresponds to your skill level.In the United States, the Yosemite Decimal System is used. The system starts at 5.0, and the higher the decimal, the more difficult the climb. The system is open-ended, so theoretically there could be a 5.30 or even 5.50 route, but the most difficult most gyms will have will be a 5.15.
If you're using a rock climbing gym in another country, be sure to ask what grading system they use, so you'll have a better understanding of how to choose your route.
The way the route system is designed, you pick the color that corresponds to the route you want, and you can complete the route by using only the hand and foot holds marked with that color of tape.

, Most rock climbing gyms have all the equipment you'll need available to rent for a small additional fee. However, if you start using the rock climbing gym on a regular basis, it may make sense for you to buy your own gear.The rock climbing gym you visit may have its own shop where you can purchase gear for your personal use. You also may be able to find rock climbing gear at outdoor specialty shops or even general sporting goods stores.
One of the advantages of buying your own gear is that you can customize the gear to your own personal preferences, and you won't have to spend time adjusting each time you go climbing.
If you plan on moving your climbing outdoors, you'll definitely need to buy your own gear. Talk to experienced climbers and gym staff to find out the best places near you that sell the gear you need.

, If you've decided to stick to bouldering, you don't necessarily need anyone to climb with you. However, if you decide to move onto belaying or rope climbing, you may want your own partner rather than having to pay for staff assistance every time you go to climb.Most climbing gyms require both of you to take a class on belaying before you'll be permitted to do it, even if your partner is only belaying you and won't be climbing themselves.
Part of the role of a good partner is to help guide you, so it helps if you choose a partner who also is interested in the sport of rock climbing, even if they don't plan on doing any indoor climbing themselves.
Trust also is a big factor with belaying, so make sure your partner is someone you trust – especially if they have less experience with rock climbing. If you hook up with someone at the climbing gym who has a lot of experience, you can trust that they will use that experience to help you and keep you safe.

, When you think of rock climbing, you may think the point is to climb higher and higher until you reach the top. However, if you focus on going around the gym at roughly the same height, you can help build muscle endurance.As you move around the gym, try to keep your movements continuous. You don't have to go at a sprint, and it doesn't matter whether any particular move is challenging or easy, as long as you are in continuous motion.
Make sure you're using proper technique. Your goal shouldn't be to wipe yourself out, but rather to get your muscles used to doing climbing movements correctly for long periods of time.

, When you're building endurance, keeping time isn't about racing – it's about lasting as long as you can on the wall with good technique and form. Build endurance by gradually increasing the length of time you're on the wall every couple of sessions.Start with shorter, 10- or 15-minute sessions – especially if you're new to rock climbing. Go for that length of time for two or three sessions, then add a couple of minutes.
Focus on your technique and continuous movement, not on going as fast or as far as you can in the time period.

, Once you've mastered continuous movement with proper technique, take your bouldering to the next level by completing routes as quickly as possible.Start with the easiest routes and work your way up in difficulty. Doing shorter routes as intervals makes this workout a lot like high-intensity interval training (especially if you add intervals of other exercises between your climbs).
Short bursts of high-intensity activity will help build muscle, and the high intensity of your exercise will help you increase your muscular endurance over time.
The mental challenge of following the route (while still moving continuously, and as quickly as possible) also helps you build the focus you need for continued concentration over longer periods of time.

, Rope climbing requires a partner to belay on the ground below. Ascending walls as high as 50 feet can be the ultimate in muscular and cardiovascular endurance – think of it as the marathon of rock climbing.You typically want to have a solid background in bouldering before you make the move to rope climbing. You need to build up the strength in your muscles, particularly your forearms and your grip strength.
When you first start, you'll feel the muscles in your upper body working harder than your lower body. The tendency of most beginners is to try to pull themselves up, rather than using their lower body to push.
As you get more practice, rope climbing will become an intense exercise in endurance while evenly working and conditioning your entire body.
Keep in mind that most rock climbing gyms require you to complete training and take an additional test before you'll be allowed to belay., The campus boards involve climbing a series of rungs affixed to a board using only your upper body as your legs swing free. Using gravity and your body weight as resistance, campus boards are a tremendous way to build upper body and grip strength.Some campus boards hang flat on a wall, while others are set at an incline for a more difficult challenge.
You can simply ascend the campus boards, or you can move across them. For a real challenge, go in a box formation: up one side, then across, down the other side, then across to your starting point.
You also can increase the difficulty by skipping rungs, or by gripping only with two fingers.

, Hangboards consist of different types of grips, each of which can be used to practice a different type of hold. You can find them in many rock climbing gyms, and they're used to build strength in your hands and fingers and improve your grip strength.Use holds no more than a fingertip deep, so you're hanging by your fingers. Contract your muscles to make sure you're not hanging directly off your joints. Hang with your fingers straight on the board, rather than angled or crimped under your thumb.
Do repetitions by doing different hangs for a couple of seconds, gradually increasing the number of seconds you're able to hang. You should do a variety of hangs, from four-fingered hangs to two-fingered hangs. Use different combinations of fingers as well.
When you can successfully hang for several seconds, increase the resistance by strapping on weights.

, Indoor climbing walls use a number of different molded holds to simulate the grips you'll find on actual rock faces in the outdoors. Each of these holds trains your grip in a different way, building strength and flexibility in your hands, wrists, and forearms.Not only should you practice with different holds, but you also should practice gripping them in different ways. For example, many of the holds are pocket holds with bowls for your fingers to fit inside. If you can grip a pocket hold with your whole hand, it can be one of the easiest – but doing it with only a couple of fingers will increase your finger and grip strength.
You also should incorporate slopers, large holds that require you to use the muscles in your palm to grasp them with a mostly flat hand while keeping your body close to the wall.
Try the holds from different angles as well, so you can get used to adjusting your body weight and staying close to the wall.

, If you're already doing bouldering sprints, intersperse them with five-minute intervals of exercises that will fatigue your muscles. Doing a bouldering sprint after your muscles are already fatigued will build strength as well as muscle endurance.Push-ups and pull-ups are exercises that build strength and power in your upper body.
Exercises such as planks and mountain climbers build strength in your core and lower body.Challenge yourself to do a bouldering route in five minutes, then immediately do five minutes of push-ups and pull-ups. Do another bouldering route, then immediately do another interval of lower-body or core exercises such as planks. After that, do another bouldering route.

Wear a loose, comfortable top.,
Choose long pants for protection.,
Stay cooler in shorts or capris.,
Get your tops and bottoms in synthetic fabrics.,
Opt for lighter colors in the heat.,
Layer in the cold.",How to Dress for Rock Climbing1," Choose a comfortable top that gives you maximum freedom of movement. Consider long sleeves for warmth or to protect you from the sun when you’re climbing outdoors. If it’s really hot, you might prefer a tank top or short sleeves., Long pants will protect your knees from scratches and abrasions. This is especially important if you’re climbing in a crack, where your knees will constantly be against the rock. Find loose, comfortable pants.Pants can get in the way of footwork so don’t get them too long or too loose.
Roll up long pants around your feet to be safe.

, Find a good, loose, comfortable pair of shorts, capris, or three-quarter-length pants for hotter days or if you prefer the freedom of movement they provide. Capris and three-quarter-length pants will keep you cooler than long pants while still protecting your knees.


Wear longer shorts. Your harness will go around your thighs. Longer shorts can protect your thighs from chafing and irritation from the harness.

, Synthetic materials will wick away sweat and keep you dry. You’ll stay cooler in the heat and warmer in the cold when your clothes are dry. Cotton can stand up better to snags from rocks and will hold up for a long time, but it will soak up sweat, get heavy, and take longer to dry.


Some go-to synthetic fibers include Tencel, Gore-Tex, nylon, and polypropylene., Wear light-colored clothes on hot days. Light colors will reflect light and heat, keeping you cooler than dark colors. You’ll also be more visible in lighter colors, which can make you safer.

, Dress in layers in cold weather. Thin layers are better than one heavy layer because heat will stay trapped between layers. You can remove layers as your body or the day heats up. You can also add layers if the day gets colder.Start with a warm base layer in synthetic material that will wick away sweat.
Add an insulating layer for added warmth.
Top it off with a layer that will protect you from the elements.
Make sure your clothes are loose enough to give you a maximum range of motion.

Find a versatile shoe with a hard rubber sole.,
Get the right fit.,
Decide how you want your shoes to fasten.,
Choose between a soft or a stiff shoe.",How to Dress for Rock Climbing2," Climbing shoes are lighter and smaller than other athletic shoes. Look for a versatile shoe with a hard rubber sole that can handle various kinds of climbs indoors and out. A hard sole can handle all kinds of climbs, will not wear out quickly, and can hold an edge longer than a softer rubber sole., All brands are different, so take your time trying them on. A tighter shoe is good for aggressive climbing. Some advanced climbers prefer really tight shoes with their toes bent in the toe box. A softer, looser shoe is suitable for less challenging climbs, climbs with different sorts of pitches, indoor climbing, and for beginners.


Unlined shoes are more comfortable, but they stretch more so aren’t as durable.
With a stiff sole you can size up a little for comfort and still be safe on all kinds of climbs.
Leather shoes will stretch more than synthetics and will gradually conform to your foot. If you choose a synthetic shoe, make sure it fits comfortably when you buy it.

, Lace-up shoes are highly adjustable and you can customize how they fit. Velcro shoes are almost as adjustable and are easier to take on and off. This is helpful when your feet get hot or when you’re going between street and climbing shoes. Slippers are the most comfortable style, but they stretch out easily and need to be replaced often.

, Soft shoes will let you feel the rock better and are better for areas with slopes because they stick to the surface better. A soft shoe will not be very supportive, so your feet might get tired more quickly than in a stiff shoe. Stiff shoes let you stand on smaller ledges, but your foot won’t feel the rock as well. A stiff shoe will give your feet more support and prevent fatigue."

Buy certified equipment.,
Protect your head with a helmet.,
Look for a comfortable harness.,
Stock up on rope.,
Pick up some carabiners for holding your ropes and for belaying.",How to Dress for Rock Climbing3," Rock climbing requires specific safety equipment. Buy equipment that is certified as the most reliable to protect you. The International Climbing and Mountaineering Association (UIAA) has a database of certified equipment that they update regularly. Certified climbing equipment will say that it is UIAA or CEN-approved.CEN is the European standard for safety.
The website for the UIAA database is http://theuiaa.org/safety-standards/certified-equipment/


, Choose a helmet specifically for climbing. Football and bicycling helmets are not made to withstand rocks and debris that might fall on your head. Pick a helmet with a snug, comfortable fit.Choose a helmet with ventilation if you tend to get hot quickly.
A light-colored helmet will keep you cooler in the sun on hot days.

, A good-fitting harness will keep you upright when you’re hanging or if you fall. Consider the fit of the waist, legs, and rise when choosing your harness. The waist should be tight enough that you can only fit a few fingers between your body and the harness. You’ll spend more time standing in your harness than you will climbing or hanging, so find one that is comfortable when you stand.Harnesses fit around your waist or your hips. You’ll be most comfortable in a harness that fits around your waist if your hips are bigger than your waist.
The leg straps should not be snug, but not tight.
The rise is the difference between your waist and your leg straps. You won’t be comfortable if this is too short. Try to find an adjustable rise.
Mesh harness are the most comfortable, breathable, and lightweight.
Gear loops should be easy to access. Make sure that they aren’t too far forward so your gear won’t bang on your thighs or get in your way while you climb.

, Ropes are critical for lead climbing, breaking a fall, rappelling, and even hauling gear. There are several considerations when you choose your ropes. Focus first on length, diameter, and whether your rope is dynamic or static. Get rope that is at least 60 feet long. Longer rope will give you more flexibility.
Ropes come in a variety of diameters. A thicker rope is a safe choice for starting out. It’s also highly durable, locks well into your carabiners, and is easy to grab.
Dynamic, stretchy ropes are best for lead climbing. Static ropes don't stretch. Both static and dynamic ropes can be used for rappelling and hauling equipment.

, Choose carabiners that clearly state they are for climbing and are certified to hold significant weight. Carabiners have locking devices and shapes that are specific to the sport. Start by choosing your carabiners based on these two features.


The D-shape is the most durable, lightweight, versatile, and common.
A pear shape has a larger basket to hold the rope and is usually used for belaying (holding the rope to stop another climber from falling).
Choose between a carabiner that locks automatically when it is shut or one that screws shut (mostly used in wet and icy conditions).

Warm up before you climb.,
Read the route before you climb.,
Maintain a medium grip.,
Make more foot movements than hand movements.,
Rest when you need to rest.,
Be ready to fall at any time.",How to Improve at Indoor Rock Climbing1," Taking time to warm up and stretch your muscles before you start a climb can help to prevent injuries. Warming up and stretching may also help to improve your performance, so it is important to start every climb with a few minutes of cardiovascular exercise and some good stretching.Try walking briskly or jogging back and forth in the gym for a few minutes to get your blood flowing.

Stretch your arms, shoulders, core, and legs before you start your climb.;
, Before you start climbing, look at the wall and try to analyze your route. Identify the best footholds and handholds, consider how you will handle difficult transitions, and plan the direction that you will take.Taking time to read your route is a great way to improve your climbing skills. If you do not take time to plan your route, you may end up wasting energy by having to backtrack or by having to take extra time to consider your moves.

, Gripping too hard with your hands can wear out your forearms quickly, which may mean that you will not be able to complete your climb. To ensure that you will have enough grip strength to complete your climb, try to maintain a lighter grip on handholds.Try to keep more of your weight on your footholds than on your handholds whenever possible.
Try to stay close to the wall. Keeping your bodyweight closer to the wall will help to keep your body weight centered and reduce strain on your forearm muscles.If you need to lean back to check your route, try to do so quickly.

, Using your feet and legs to move your body upwards is more efficient than using your hands and arms, so try to make most of your movements with your feet. You should try to make three foot movements for every one hand movement.For example, you could reach up to a high handhold and then use your feet to move your body closer to the hand hold by changing your footholds three times.

, Take a few moments to rest and regain your strength whenever you become fatigued. To rest, lean in close to the wall and use your feet to support your body weight while maintaining a light grip on your handholds.Keep in mind that if you become fatigued, you have a higher chance of falling. Pay attention to how you feel to determine when you should rest during your climbs.

, It is normal to falls sometimes when you are doing a climb. If you never fall, then you may not be challenging yourself enough. When you do need to fall, you will probably know and you should do certain things to make your fall as safe as possible.Do not loop your rope around anything or any part of yourself.
Push yourself out and away from the wall if you fall.
Pay attention to potential holds below you.
Put your feet up towards the wall to avoid hitting your head.

Build up your forearm muscles.,
Train your arms and shoulders.,
Improve your core strength.,
Work on your balance.,
Stretch your muscles.",How to Improve at Indoor Rock Climbing2," Your forearms make it possible for you to grip and hold onto your handholds. If your forearms are weak, then you may not be able to hang on for long. To strengthen your grip, do exercises that target your forearm muscles.Try getting a grip exerciser. These are handheld training devices that you squeeze with your hands to improve your grip.

, Having good arm and shoulder strength can also make it easier for you to hold onto your handholds. To increase your arm and shoulder strength, include some pull ups and chin ups in your exercise routine.If you can’t do a chin up or pull up yet, then include some weight training exercises that use the same movements, such as pull downs and presses.

, Your entire core will be engaged while you are climbing, so it is important to strengthen these muscles. You can do crunches, side crunches, planks, and other core strengthening exercises to build up your core strength.Try holding a plank pose for 30 to 60 seconds once or twice per day.

Do an abdominal workout a few times per week.

, If you have poor balance, then this may make it harder for you to make certain transitions or stick on certain points as you climb. Incorporating some balance exercises into your routine can make it easier for you to handle balance-testing moments in your climbs.Try standing on one foot in front of the climbing wall and lifting one foot in front of you. Then, point your toe and touch the tip of your toe to different footholds on the wall. Make sure that the moves are slow and controlled. Then, repeat the exercise with your other foot.

, Being flexible will also help you to be a better climber, so always take time to stretch your muscles after you have trained them. You can sue a combination of yoga poses and traditional stretches to improve your flexibility. Some good stretches to use in your training routine include:



Frog pose.

Forward bend.

Cobra pose.

Shoulder and arm stretches.
Leg Stretch

"
Use static climbing technique.,
Incorporate dynamic climbing techniques.,
Try lead climbing.,
Observe experienced climbers.,
Take your training outside.",How to Improve at Indoor Rock Climbing3," Static climbing technique emphasizes fluid movements and even weight distribution. Rather than using momentum to propel yourself upwards, you position yourself close to the wall, position your arms and legs, and then shift your body weight to the new position., Dynamic climbing technique emphasizes propelling your body upwards towards a specific point that you could not otherwise reach. You will need to have strong footholds and handholds to start, but then your will use these holds to spring up towards a higher handhold.After using dynamic techniques, you may need to dangle from the new hold for a few moments until you can steady yourself, and then find footholds to maintain your position.

, Lead climbing is a step up in difficulty from top rope climbing, so you may want to give it a try. With lead climbing, you do not have a rope attached to anything when you start. Instead, you clip a rope that is attached to you to different bolts along your route.Many gyms offer classes in lead climbing that can help you to develop skills in this area. Check your local gym for upcoming classes., By watching experienced climbers while they climb, you can see how they handle difficult obstacles and transitions. You may also learn about new climbing techniques that you can try during your next climb.Spend some time before or after your climbs to watch experienced climbers and make mental notes about what they do. Think about how you can incorporate these techniques and strategies into your own climb.
Keep in mind that you may need to modify some of these techniques to suit your skill level. For example, if you want to include a dynamic technique, then you might need to start with a small leap rather than trying to launch yourself to a spot that is a few feet away.

, Climbing on an indoor rock wall is quite different from climbing outside. After you have mastered some basic skills, you'll probably be itching to try climbing outside. The experience may provide you with some new skills that will help you with your indoor climbs.You may very well become addicted to the outdoor vistas and adventure of it all.

Find a climbing gym, or climbing locations near you.,
Track your progress daily in a journal.,
Immediately after finishing climbing, do hand, forearm, and back exercises.,
On days you are not climbing (3 other days a week) stretch and go running.,
Practice flexibility- before runs, do light stretching.,
Change your diet to whatever helps you burn the most fat.,
When climbing, practice practice practice.,
Footwork is key.,
Slim your legs down.",How to Get in Shape for Rock Climbing," Set aside 2 or 3 days a week to climb. Sessions should be between 1-3 hours of maximum-effort climbing. This structure allows hypertrophy to occur in the muscles involved, without overtraining.;
, Then, always work to achieve a new personal best. Just like in the weight room, you track your progress and slowly up the weights... The same concept applies here. (Caution: Don't overcomplicate it, or waste time. Keep it simple)

, These include: 1) 3 sets of hand grippers. 2) 3 sets of hand grippers in a claw-like motion, with fingers straight, using fingertips and your thumb tip to press the gripper together. 3) 3 sets of pull-ups, to failure. (Once you can do more than 20 pull-ups, start slowly adding weight.) 3B) Then do 3 sets of horizontal pull-ups to failure (also known as ""rows""). 4) hanging by fingertips from the hang-board, for as long as possible. Once you can hang for over 30 seconds, start slowly adding weight. Eventually, practice ""climbing up"" the hangboard. 5) Do weighted sit-ups, to work abs and core. 6) Do trunk twists, with weight, to work abs and core. Both of these ab exercises- 5 and 6- help you to stabilize and rotate your body while climbing.

, Alternate between running sprints one day, to greatly strengthen the heart and lungs and burn fat, and also longer distance the next day, to burn fat. For example, run eight 100m sprints during the sprint day, then run a 1 or 2 mile (1.6 or 3.2 km) run on the long distance day. Keep the runs extremely intense, but varied. For example perhaps run hurdles or 40m sprints on a sprint day. Or maybe run a 5K or 10K once in a while.

, After runs, really breathe deeply and stretch as good as you can. With consistency, you will become more flexible. The goal is to be able to eventually reach your hands about 4 inches (10.2 cm) past your toes- this level of flexibility is necessary if you ever want to able to ""rest"" your legs on a ledge above you, during more strenuous climbs. Overall body flexibility is important as well. Go through a complete stretching routine post-run.

, (Less fat, equals less weight without a loss of strength, equals better climbing ability) For most people, the solution is a low-carb but high protein diet, with ample veggies and some fruits, with an active lifestyle and many small meals. For a few people, a diet high in both protein and carbs allows them to really shred down. Also: Drink a lot of milk regardless (organic, and sugar free if necessary to burn the fat), and add one bone strengthening supplement daily (calcium, vitamin D, and other minerals/nutrients). This supplement will allow the bones and tendons in your hand to strengthen faster. Ultimately, you will not be able to climb really crucial stone until your hands themselves can support that kind of strain, so a proper diet is a must.

, Learn a route, and then drill it like it is a basketball or a football drill. This may take away from the ""mystique"" of climbing but it will get you good. Do the same thing with specific moves or hand holds. Practice your slopers, crimps, grips, until you are a master at them. Practice more at something, if you are bad at it. Don't avoid it, confront it. Practice your heel hooks, drop knees, dynos, footwork, etc.

, Watch plenty of youtube videos on footwork, especially. There have been countless times excellent footwork has saved me, or made a hard route become easy. In fact, youtube videos until the cows come home. They have so many excellent (and free) instructional videos out there. With ample learning, and a strict, intense training regimen, you will succeed faster than most.

, Legs are added weight- bulky legs do not contribute to a climber's body. To achieve this, do the running from earlier, and also do box step-ups. Do 2 sets until failure of each leg, after climbing (do these at the same time you work your back and hands). Also, do jump-squats- these will help build type II-B explosive fibers, which will not only slim your legs down further (which is good) but they will also give you the explosive power to dyno farther.

Head to a rock gym or bouldering gym to safely learn basic skills and safety.,
Rent a pair of snug shoes and a chalk bag.,
Climb to the top of the wall or problem any way you can to get used to the sport.,
Push up from your legs instead of pulling up with your arms.,
Plan your moves in advance, putting your limbs in position for each move.,
Find good resting points to plan your route and relax your arms.,
Move deliberately up the wall.,
Know that climbing muscles take some time to build.",How to Rock Climb1," You can also boulder outdoors, but you'll need to find out about safe, established bouldering sites before getting on a rock. Moreover, outdoor sites are usually more difficult, and require guides and deeper knowledge of rock formations. Rock gyms are safe, well-designed spaces for a variety of skill levels, and they often have classes and staff to help you learn. In general, you have two options starting out:



Bouldering routes are short rock climbing problems that don't require harnesses or ropes, and are a fantastic way to build your climbing skills safely, without complex introductions to belaying or equipment. Since these problems require no ropes certain constraints that come with roped climbing are avoided. Bouldering routes are great for learning to climb and are a fun way to climb although you lack the safety that you would have with a rope.

Top-roping is what most people think of when they think of rock climbing. You're tied in and scaling a large wall. In order to top-rope you'll need a partner. If you're brand new to the sport, check with the staff about ""belay partners,"" or boulder until you feel comfortable asking for a partner.;
, Rock climbing shoes need to be snug so that you can feel the precise edges of the rock. They may feel uncomfortable at first, as the toes are often pointed in order to help you stay on small chips and edges, but you'll get used to them quickly. Just make sure they don't cut off circulation. Chalk bags, while not necessary, are used to keep your hands dry -- essential for holding onto the rock as you get tired. Simply dip you fingers lightly in the chalk and clap them together so you have a light chalky dusting on your hands.


Harnesses, clips, and belay devices are necessary if you're top-roping. The remainder of this section assumes you are already tied in, or are bouldering.

, Most walls are marked by routes -- specific sets of rock that you must use to get to the top. While these are more challenging and fun for experts, you need to get comfortable with the height, the holds, and the general feel of climbing first. Ignore the tape marks and just head up the wall, working on the basics of your form. Once you're comfortable climbing, you're ready to start tackling some basic routes.


If you really want to get to routes, looks for one labeled 5.4 or 5.5, which are good beginner ratings. (In French, sport grades are commonly used. These will be 3 or 3+, 4 or 4+.)
The fear of falling and the fear of heights are perfectly normal human instincts. Remember, however, that you have a bevy of safety equipment, padded floors, and a knowledgeable person holding you up. After your first few slips, you'll get used to it.
Starting with an expert, even just a friend who climbs often, is a great way to break slowly into the sport.

, This is the number one rule of good climbing, and the hardest thing to get used to. It feels natural to pull your body up the wall because your fingers feel like they're more firmly locked onto the holds. But your legs are much, much stronger muscles, and you'll tire out halfway up the wall if you're trying to do ten consecutive pull-ups. There are a couple of surefire tips to get accustomed to using your legs:


Keep your arms extended. Let your weight hang low, gripping the hand holds purely for balance and bending your knees for power.
Set your feet before moving your hands. Get good, solid footholds that you can put weight on.
Keep your weight on your toes, not on your hands, by dropping your heels lower than your toes., If you're struggling to reach a handhold with your left hand, you don't have to become Mr. Fantastic to grab it. You need to move your left foot higher -- elongating your left side and making the reach easier. Climbing is a deliberate, thoughtful sport, and muscling up the wall will only get you so far. Stop to think about the best way up a route, or ask experienced climbers for advice.


Learning to read a route from the ground, visualizing where your hands and feet will go in advance, is an essential skill you can never start practicing too soon.
The more time you spend gripping the wall, unsure where to go, the more tired you'll get.
The set of moves you use to get up a wall is called your ""beta."", Most routes have 1-2 spots where you can catch your breath and loosen your muscles. A good rest spot is anywhere you can comfortably stand with most of your weight on your feet. You should be able to take one arm comfortably off the wall to get chalk and stretch out. While resting:


Plan out your next few moves. Memorize what footholds you have coming up and think about which limb you want to go where. If needed, ask someone at the bottom for advice.
Re-chalk your hands. Chalk runs off on rocks, so get some more.
Shake out your arms. Let them hang and give them a good shake to dislodge some of the lactic acid that has built up., There are advanced moves that require speed, rapid precision, and even small leaps (called ""dynos""), but these are for later in your career. For now, you want to focus on fluid motion. The best way to do this is to focus on each limb first, then move your body. Also known as ""static climbing technique,"" you move each limb, get set, then move your body over into the new position. Think of yourself as a slinky, coiling and uncoiling up the wall.


Set your feet, knees bent.
Shift your body weight the direction you're headed.
Step up with a foot while simultaneously grabbing a new hold with the matching hand.
Re-set your feet and opposite hand.
Repeat., One of the biggest hurdles for new climbers is that they feel weak after only 1-2 runs. Your fingers will be sore and your forearms will be burning, so much so that you don't feel like you can even hold onto the wall anymore. This is natural, however -- your forearms are not frequently used at this intensity in everyday life. However, if you climb a few routes 2-3 times a week you'll quickly get over this hump and can focus on climbing technique, not how sore your arms are.


Take rest breaks in between climbs. Don't get back on the wall until your feel rested again.
Stretch your forearms by clasping your palms in front of your chest and elbows out as if you were praying. Slowly rotate your hands down until they point in front of you to stretch."

Always learn to tie in and belay with a trained supervisor.,
Attach your harness as snugly as possible.,
Create a figure-eight in the bottom of the rope, leaving roughly an arm's length at the bottom.,
Thread the end of the rope into your harness.,
Take the end of the rope and trace out your figure eight to make a double eight knot.,
Pull the rope tight and consider making a safety knot.,
Check your knot for safety.,
Communicate with your belayer before climbing.",How to Rock Climb2," Belaying is not a difficult process, but it is an essential one if you're serious about climbing. Most climbing gyms will require you to take a supervised test before you're allowed to belay someone. They usually offer classes or free, quick lessons as well. You should always practice belaying with a trained expert. While belaying needs to be trained in person, however, you should know how to tie into your rope no matter what your skill level.



Belaying is when someone stands below the climber with the rope. They catch them if they fall, give them more rope as they climb, and lower them down slowly when they finish., Whether climbing or belaying, your harness should be snug across your waist and thighs. Do no skimp on this -- tighten every buckle as much as your comfortably can. This includes the leg loops, which cannot be skipped., This is frequently done for you at climbing gyms, but you should understand the process if it is not. There will be two identical strands of rope coming down from the top of the wall. Grab the one closest to the wall and measure out roughly an arm's length. From there:


Gripping the rope at your ""arm's length,"" drop the bottom of the rope. Holding it up, you should have an upside-down ""U"" shape in your hands.
Pinch the two sides of the U to create a ""bite,"" or small 1-2"" loop.
Wrap the bottom of your rope around the bite. You'll cross over your hand so that the end of the rope is back on your side of the bite.
Thread the end of the rope through your bite hole.
Pull the end of the role through to make your figure eight., This is how you tie in. While all harnesses are different, in general, you'll thread the rope through two loops in the front of your harness. You'll later tie the end of the rope into your figure eight, effectively attaching yourself to the rope.


Make sure that the rope goes through both loops -- the one on your legs and your waist, before tying in.

, Once you're figure-eight is made and you're attached to the rope, complete the tie-in by doubling up on your knot. To do so, you'll simply take then end of the rope in your hand and follow the shape of your figure eight, threading the end in, under, and over the rope to create a snug, secure double figure eight:


Note the path of the rope coming back towards you, from your figure eight.
Slide the end of your rope exactly the same way this rope runs so that you have parallel ropes.
Trace the rope up and over, then back through the figure eight. Again, you're just trying to follow this rope line, create two parallel ropes for a double figure eight.
When you're done, the end of the rope should be pointing forward, following the rope up the wall.

, Grip the both sides of the rope, two ropes at a time, and pull the knot tight. Use your fingers to push or mold the double figure eight so that you have parallel lines throughout with no crossing, twisting, or braiding. Most gyms require a simple safety knot as well, tying off the loose end. To do so:


Place your thumb on the rope, roughly 2-3"" above the figure eight. Grip the loose end in your other hand.
Wrap the loose end over your thumb twice, making an X above your thumb.
Wrap the end around one last time, then feed it through the hole where your thumb is.
Pull the loose end tight to cinch the knot down., There will be five pairs of parallel rope -- one before the knot, one after the knot, and three little segments in your double figure eight. Your double figure eight should look identical on the top and bottom, and the safety knot should be tight. There shouldn't be any crossed ropes. If there are, loosen the figure eight slightly and bend or move the ropes so that they are all parallel, then tighten it again.


Always have an experienced climber check your ropes when you're first starting out.

, There is an almost universal code for climbers, and it is used to ensure that everyone is set and the safety measures are in place. Before you climb, you must always follow this protocol. However, some places use different climbing calls.


You ask, ""On Belay?""
They reply, ""Belay on.""
You get ready on the wall and say, ""Climbing?""
They respond, ""climb on."""
"
Keep your hips close to the wall by pointing your knees to the side.,
Relax your grip.,
Find your ""dead point"" when making big moves on the wall.,
Climb with rhythm.,
Climb down a few routes.,
Increase your climbing pace while staying deliberate in your movements.,
Watch other climbers to learn new moves and possible betas.",How to Rock Climb3," The more you lean back, the more you rely on your fingers to hold you close to the wall. This drains your energy quickly and will almost definitely hurt your fingers over time. Instead, angle your knees away from the wall, almost like a frog, to keep your hips close to the wall. Whenever you need to push away to survey the route or grab another hold, make the movement quickly, then hug the way again to save energy.You want as much weight as possible on your feet at all times.

, Frequently, during harder moves or when you get tired, you'll tend to grip the hold tightly. However, your hand holds are generally just there for balance. Remember, you want your feet to do most of the work, so loosen up your fingers. Trust them, almost hanging from them for balance, not to keep your weight on the wall. Your fingers are basically just balance hooks.


As you get better, you'll encounter overhangs and moves that require some serious finger strength. However, you'll build this naturally as you progress towards harder climbs.

, The dead point is the spot when you transition from moving up to falling down. Basically, your momentum is shifting from a ""jump"" to a fall, and as such you don't move at all, making it easier to grab the hold. Not all moves are close enough that you can move slowly from one to the other. Sometimes you'll need to push off with your foot and grab the hold while on the move. Learning to grab it right when you hit your apex will greatly increase your fluidity on the wall.


To practice, find a route with several holds just out of reach, or practice on the bouldering wall. Practice grabbing the hold with your arm extended so that you don't feel any drop as you grip it.

, While this may change for some routes or crux moves, developing a rhythm is often the best way to conscientiously build good climbing habits. Think of moving with the feet first, going foot, foot, hand, hand, or foot, hand, foot, hand, up the entire wall. Start with some easy routes to get used to this. Because you're moving quickly, with your feet first, you'll naturally come to rely on your leg muscles and stop over-using and tiring your hands.Quick, focused climbing saves energy, as it prevents hanging on the wall and getting tired.
Focus on your breathing as you move. Many people hold their breath as they try hard moves, but that just deprives your muscles of much-needed oxygen. As you develop a rhythm, breath into it as well so that you have regular, rhythmic breathing.

, This is a great training exercise for your balance and route spotting. Most importantly, it focuses on landing your feet very precisely, making your footwork exponentially better. If you can use your feet effectively on the way down, you'll develop the skills needed to place your feet anywhere on the way up quickly., Skilled climbers move quickly, as this saves energy wasted by holding onto a rock while deciding what to do. While you don't want to try scrambling up the rock, lunging wildly, you want to make your moves quickly. Once you've decided what to do -- do it. Don't wait around or keep shifting as you'll only lose energy and make the rest of the climb even harder., The beta, or sequence of moves used, becomes increasingly important the harder the route gets. While beginners generally can choose 4-5 ways up a route, difficult routes (5.10 and up) sometimes only have 1-2 sets of moves that can be used. Frequently, they aren't always that obvious. There are hundreds of moves, techniques, and little tricks that can be used for specific problems, but the rock climbing community is luckily a very inclusive one. Watch other climbers, pantomiming the moves from the ground to get used to hand positioning.If you're struggling on a route, ask another climber for advice. Your belay partner may have a great view from the ground, for example, of a move or hold you're missing.

Warm up.,
Make sure you have taken a 3-4 minute break since your last climb/attempt.,
Have chalk ready.,
Look at the climb and make sure you know what you are going to do.

,
Look for the crux (hardest part of the route).,
If it is a route, find any spots that look like a good rest.,
Make sure you keep straight arms for as many of the moves as possible.,
Focus on your fee.,
Focus and just go for it.",How to Move up Overhanging Rock Without Wasting Energy in Rock Climbing," Before getting on a climb that has overhang, make sure you are already warmed up. Otherwise you can hurt yourself by pulling a muscle.;
, This will avoid your being too tired to make it a good try.

, Also check that your shoes are on tightly enough so they won't come off on certain moves.

,, Once you have identified it, figure out how you will move past it. If you have the opportunity, ask other people that have climbed it  how they did it.

, If it is a boulder you shouldn't be resting because it is best just to power through.

, Only lock off when it is the only way to do the move.

, You want too make sure they don't cut a lot because this is also very energy consuming. Techniques like heel hooking and toe hooking can be very helpful. Make sure your feet aren't too high or low either.

, But remember it doesn't matter if you can't do a climb as long as you have fun and don't get too frustrated. A lot of climbing has to do with the mental aspect, and if you don't think you can do something 90% of the time you won't do it.

Train your plank.",How to Do Mountain Climbers," Get down on the floor on your hands and knees. Extend your legs out behind you, balancing on the balls and toes. Place your hands directly under your shoulders with your fingers facing forward and slightly outward. Keep your core engaged by squeezing your stomach muscles. Your body should be in a straight line from your crown to your heels.Don’t allow your body to come out of alignment. A sagging butt or V-shaped hip angle are symptoms of bad form.Hold your arms strong and straight, but don’t lock your elbows. This could lead to injury.;
, Lift one foot and begin bending the knee as you pull it up between the front of your body and the floor. Bring the knee forward in one smooth, controlled motion. Don’t let either of your knees sag or come into contact with the floor. Once you’ve raised your knee as far as you can, contract and hold your abs briefly but forcefully.If possible, try to touch the top of your thigh to your chest.
Resistance is created by gravity to work the core muscles, quadriceps, hip flexors, and glutes, while the chest, deltoids, lats, and lower back are responsible for stabilizing the plank position., Relax your midsection and push your knee back toward your other foot slowly. Straight your leg and set your foot back on the ground behind you. Then, bring the other knee forward, moving fluidly and squeezing your abs.


You should have one foot on the floor at all times to serve as your base., Return your leg to the floor behind you and begin pulling the opposite knee up once more. Repeat this motion until you get comfortable with it. That’s it! Do as many mountain climbers as you can before you tire out, and try to increase the number over time. This exercise makes a welcome addition to any strength and conditioning workout.








Mountain climbers take their name from their resemblance to the techniques used to scale steep mountainsides.
Once you start getting the hang of it, you can increase your speed until your legs are bounding rather than moving one at a time.

, Before you jump into a weightlifting session or go for a run, run through a couple quick sets of mountain climbers to limber up and get your blood flowing. Mountain climbers make an excellent warm up exercise because they recruit so many muscles at once and actively involve the core. Go until you start getting out of breath, then follow up with some light stretching before you really get to work.








Starting your workout with complex, multi-joint movements can save you a lot of time, since you won’t have to warm up each part of the body individually.

, If you want to keep your heart rate up during your workout, fill the spaces between more difficult exercises with simple movements like mountain climbers. They’re strenuous enough to benefit your heart and lungs and provide a little extra resistance training without totally wiping you out. Try doing some mountain climbers at a moderate pace rather than just sitting still on your rest breaks.








Only experienced athletes should minimize rest breaks or intentionally increase the difficulty of their workouts. If you’re still new to training, take full advantage of your recovery periods.

, The biggest perk of mountain climbers is their ability to stimulate the muscles of the core. For ab sessions, do a slower variation of the exercise where you really squeeze hard at the peak of the knee lift and hold each contraction for 2-3 seconds. You’re guaranteed to feel it the next day—there’s nothing better for sculpting a tight, toned stomach.The plank itself is a challenging core exercise, making mountain climbers doubly effective.
Use mountain climbers in conjunction with other core movements such as crunches, leg lifts, and bicycle kicks to hit the upper abs, lower abs and obliques from every angle.

, Instead of using them in the main part of your workout or as a warmup, conclude your session by cranking out as many consecutive mountain climbers as you can. Finishers can be torturous, since you’ll already be drained from your workout, but the number of calories you burn when you give that little bit extra will skyrocket.








For best results, finishers should be done to the point of exhaustion. However, try not to overdo it.
Your arms will shake, your back and midsection will burn, and the sweat will flow. Keep pushing through the fatigue.

, Since mountain climbers require proper foot placement and dynamic movement, it’s important to pick out a pair of sneakers with grippy soles that will allow you to change position quickly without worrying about losing your footing. Whatever footwear you choose should also be laced tight to prevent slippage. The last thing you want is to have to sit out the next few workouts because you rolled an ankle.Good shoes will provide much-needed traction and protection on harder flooring.
In some instances (such as yoga or martial arts classes), you may have success doing the exercise barefoot, provided you have strong feet and ankles and you’re on a surface like carpet that compensates for grip. Just be careful not to jam your toes.

, This is all you really need to start doing the exercise. Look for a space that will accommodate your full height. Any surface is fine as long as it is flat, free of obstacles and comfortable enough to rest your hands on for an extended period of time. You can drop and do mountain climbers almost anywhere, making them an extremely convenient way to break a sweat.Mountain climbers are perfectly suited for the gym, the office, the beach or the comfort of your own living room. Not having a place to work out is no longer an excuse.

, Keep a clear path between your midsection and the floor for your knees to travel. Be careful not to hit your supporting arms with your knees as you swing them in beneath you. Don’t let your lower back sag or your hips to come up too high: this could throw off your rhythm.Be sure to give yourself enough room so that you’re not cramping your range of motion or bumping into furniture.
Your knees should move in a straight line. Try not to let them flare out to the sides as you bring them towards your hands.

, To perform sequential mountain climbers, you should be able to hold a plank position for at least 30 seconds. If you have trouble keeping your core engaged or supporting your weight on your arms, build up your plank before introducing any knee movement. Start by holding the position for 10 seconds at a time, and gradually work on increasing the duration while decreasing the amount of rest you take.While you’re focusing on developing the necessary core strength, you can simplify the plank by resting on your elbows rather than fully extending your arms. Keep both forearms in contact with the floor parallel beneath your chest."

Keep a cool head when you attempt it.",How to Rock Climb Overhangs on a Rock Wall1," Gather your gear and build up skills.;
, Due to changing gym routes, by the time you're ready to make an attempt, the route might have been taken down. Don't fear, though! Gym routesetters have a tendency to put a fairly easy route on the biggest overhang in the gym. If you're just starting out, though, opt for a smaller overhang.

, Although this is optional, most overhangs are lead-only so there aren't any swinging top rope climbers.

, Although using your feet is more important than ever, upper body strength will be a big help as well. Practice pull-ups and hand boards, but the best way to train for climbing is to climb.

,


Keep your hips in close to the wall to have more weight on your feet. Be as close to vertical as you can, but keep your feet on the wall and don't sag.
Use hooks! Heel and toe hooks are both great moves on overhangs. Heel hooks act as an extra hand and are used for pulling. They don't come off from the wall as easily as normal foot placements do on overhangs. To do a heel hook, just put your heel up high on the wall and hook it behind a jug. Toe hooks are used on under clings. To use a toe hook, place your foot low on an under cling. Put your toe behind the jug. Pull with your hands to achieve opposition. Toe hooks are used to keep you in place on the wall.
Kneebars, although rare, are incredible. A kneebar is when you can place your foot on a large hold and your knee against another hold and let go with both your hands. Kneebars are perfect rests and look very cool. Make sure you don't hit your head if you fall attempting one, though!
If there's a dihedral, you can get a no-hands rest off of it.

, Although it might seem easy to be overwhelmed, it's not as bad as it looks. Try your hardest to make it, but don't push past the point of injury. If you fail, then try again and again.

,Congratulate yourself!",How to Climb Mt. Fuji," This is essential when planning your trip. Climbing during the off-season is extremely dangerous. Mountain huts are closed, the snow is deep, the wind is very strong, and the temperatures are extremely cold. In the off-season, climbers have been blown off the mountain by strong winds. If you insist on climbing in the off season, you must register your expedition with the local government.;
, This week in August is the busiest season for climbing Mt. Fuji. The crowds are incredible, so it is best to avoid it. Climbing on a weekday is recommended.

, Mt. Fuji has several hiking trails with different starting points, altitudes, and difficulty. Trails start from the 5th station (about halfway up the mountain). Although it is possible to start at the foot of the mountain, most people do not do this.The total ascent time ranges from 4-10 hours, depending on the trail you take and the number of people. Deciding the trail is essential when it comes to making reservations.

, Mt. Fuji is an extremely popular destination among Japanese and foreigners alike. People of all ages and physical ability try to climb Mt. Fuji. Some climb slower than others.There will be many people and many tour groups. The paths are usually very narrow, and it's difficult to pass people who are moving slowly. If you are a fast climber, be prepared for a very slow climb. For fast climbers, a slow ""stop-and-go"" pace may be one of the most difficult things of climbing Mt. Fuji. For beginners it is useful because it gives you a chance to take a break and catch your breath. Also, the experience of tackling the mountain with several other people can be rewarding for others.

, Fuji should only be done in 2 days. Climbing the mountain in one day is extremely dangerous and should not be attempted. Local authorities strongly discourage hiking in a single day and there are signs at the the trail-heads which warn against doing so. Altitude sickness can strike anyone, regardless of your physical condition. If you get altitude sickness you will become a burden to the people who work on the mountain because they will have to help you. You will also inconvenience other climbers. Trails are narrow and if you stop, it will force everyone behind you to stop. Therefore, everyone behind you may not make it in time to see the sunrise. Avoid altitude sickness by making a reservation at a mountain hut.

, Mountain huts are small lodges which provide food and a place to sleep. They fill up very quickly so you should make reservations at least 1 month in advance. Some huts have staff who speak English. These lodges give you the opportunity to replenish your energy and acclimate to the altitude. Huts are located at the 7th and 8th station. The staff will also wake you up when it is time to resume the climb so that you can reach the summit before sunrise.

, There are many buses and trains which go toward the 5th station of Mt. Fuji leaving from Shinjuku. Reserve bus tickets (and train tickets if you want) for the bus which goes to the correct 5th station. Do this only after reserving the mountain hut. The bus you take will change depending on the trail you are hiking and the mountain hut you are staying at. You might want to reserve return trip tickets too, although you won't know the exact time that you'll return to the station. If you don't reserve return trip tickets, you can buy them at the 5th station, although you may need to wait for an available bus.

, They will provide it for you. Otherwise, continue from Step 2.

, Fuji is relatively easy, but you do need appropriate gear. Otherwise your climb could end in disaster. Recommended gear includes:


Comfortable climbing boots. No, sneakers are not acceptable. You should have boots made specifically for climbing. Waterproof ones are the best. Mountain weather changes quickly, and wet feet will freeze at the summit. If you get wet, you may not be able to see the sunrise. You should get boots which have plenty of room for your toes and do not hurt your heel. Don't settle for ""good enough"".
Climbing socks. Many mountain climbing goods stores sell socks for climbing. They will keep your feet warm and comfortable.
Rain wear. This does not mean ""raincoat"". You need a waterproof shirt and pants made for climbing or hiking. These can be kept in your backpack unless it rains. However, if it rains and you do not have waterproof wear, then you will turn into an icicle at the summit.
Layers of warm clothes. This is one of the most important things you will need. The summit is extremely cold and very windy. You will be waiting there for a long time for the sunrise. Do not underestimate it or you will have a very unpleasant experience. Pack a lot of extra warm clothes in your backpack.
A headlamp. If you want to see the sunrise then you will have to climb at night. A good headlamp is necessary to see the trail in front of you.
Waterproof gloves. Gloves are very useful. Although the trails are usually very easy, there are a couple places where you will need to use your hands to push forward. You will have to hold onto some rocks. Gloves will protect your hands.
A hat for climbing. A waterproof climbing hat will keep your head dry and the sun out of your eyes. Baseball caps cannot be used because they will be blown off your head from the wind. A hat with a string is necessary.
A waterproof climbing backpack. You need a bag which can fit your extra clothes and some water and snacks.
Stocks. Although they are not necessary, they can help you with balance and take some pressure off of you feet and legs. They are especially useful when climbing down the mountain because your legs will be tired.
1 liter (0.3 US gal) of water. Water is sold along the trail. It is expensive, but carrying it in your bag will make climbing much harder. Instead, just buy water along the trail.
A few snacks. Light snacks can keep your energy up. Stores sell snacks along the trail, but they are expensive. Do not bring too many because they will be heavy. Also, you should keep all of your trash in your bag.
A camera. You'll want to take a picture of the sunset. Taking pictures along the trail is not recommended because you will slow down everyone behind you if you stop.
Money. Buying food and drinks along the trail is expensive, but it's better than carrying a heavy load on your back. Also, using the toilets along the trail costs money. Bring several 100-yen coins.
Bandages and other first aid supplies. Better safe than sorry.

, Once there, use the bathroom, eat at a restaurant, and do some stretching. There are small stores at the other stations along the trail, but they will be more expensive. Also, bathrooms along the trail cost money.

, Pace yourself. If you are in a tour group, the group will take mandatory rests where the trail widens up so other people can pass. If you are not in a tour group, take rests whenever you feel tired. Slow and steady wins the race. Getting sick on the mountain is something no one wants to happen.

, Don't risk dehydration just to save some money.

, Mt. Fuji is a majestic sacred mountain, world heritage site, and national treasure. Do not ruin it. Bring all of your trash home. There are no garbage cans.

, Bathrooms cost money. Pay with 100-yen coins in the box outside the bathrooms. It is on a ""contribution"" system. However, ""contribution"" does not mean optional. The money goes toward keeping the mountain beautiful and supplying services to climbers.

, If they are wet, the staff will give you a towel to dry them off before entering the hut.

, The staff will tell you when it's your turn to eat dinner. Be sure to fill up so you have the energy to push for the summit.

, If you can't sleep, step outside the hut and check out the stunning night view of the city down below. If you are lucky and there are no clouds, you will be stunned by the city lights.

, You might be too excited to sleep, but it's a good idea to rest your body. You will be literally side by side other climbers, all cramped together in a big room. You will be on the floor in sleeping bags. Once it's ""lights-out"" it is time to sleep. Everyone needs to rest to prepare for the final push in the middle of the night. Do not talk or laugh with your friends. If you are a foreigner then you are representing your country. Behave appropriately and politely. ""When in Rome, do as the Romans."" In Japan, Japanese will never talk or laugh after it's ""lights-out"". If other climbers are talking loudly and laughing, take a stand and tell them directly that they need to stop. Your sleep and rest are important.

, The staff will wake you up so you can resume the climb and reach the summit in time to see the sunrise, even if you are a slow climber. There is no need to rush. Gather your things together and head for the top.

, You will be climbing in the middle of the night and it will be dark, cold, and probably windy. Night climbing can be a little stressful and nerve racking because you can't see far ahead.

, If you feel tired, take a break where the trail widens up The mountain hut staff will have woken you up with plenty of time to reach the summit, so even if you stop a few times, you should still make it. But if you get altitude sickness you won't. You will also inconvenience others if this happens.

,, There are some small stores and a cafeteria at the summit where you can get hot milk or tea. There should also be some food. If you arrived too early, they might still be closed, but usually open around 4:00.

, There are some places around the summit which are optimal for sunrise viewing. Go sit or stand there and wait. People will be in a mad rush to get the best spots. After you find a good spot, keep it. Don't let anyone push you around or cut in front of you. You worked hard to reach the summit and find a good location. Be direct and sternly tell them that this is your spot.

, The summit is incredibly cold and windy, even in July or August. Now that you have stopped climbing, your body is producing less heat so you will feel very cold. Play word games with your friends until the sun comes up. As soon as the sun comes up it will become warm and the wind will subside.

, It will be one of the most beautiful things in the world. You might even cry. That's okay. The sun rises very fast, so don't miss it!

, If you have a good location, try to get one with the sunrise in the background.

, Fuji!"" souvenirs. There are special things you can buy at the summit. Some people will even engrave your name (and your friend's names) and the date you climbed onto a charm. These will help you remember how hard you worked to get to the top.

,, Do not walk down the same path by which you came. Walking down the mountain can be very tiring and hard on your legs. Use your stocks to take some pressure off your legs. Do not run too fast or you may fall.

, You will definitely be tired and your legs may be sore.

Focus on exercises that will improve cardiovascular and strength. Practise waking up flights of stairs with weights. Try climbing other mountains first. As you improve your fitness, increase your workout length and intensity.


Six months prior: Begin to get into a workout routine four times a week. Your workouts should be enjoyable such as jogging or cycling. Introduce yourself to medium intensity muscular exercises such as push-ups, chin-ups and sit-ups.
Five months prior: Increase your workout length and intensity. You may want to increase your workouts to 6 days a week. Increase reps of muscular exercises. Introduce the climbing element to your workouts such as walking up steep hills while carrying a heavy backpack.
Four months prior: Build up your aerobic endurance. You should now practise high intensity 45 minute aerobic workouts six days a week. Continue climbing exercises and only increase your backpack weight, if you are sure you are ready, otherwise you can damage your knees.
Three months prior: At this point you must be physically and mentally conditioned. Regularly take multivitamin tablets and small amounts of iron supplements. Iron helps your blood cells carry oxygen, but too much is unhealthy. Maintain a healthy diet and increase your aerobic workouts to an hour. Continuing practising climbing, but make it harder such as sprinting up steep hills. Try to get an opportunity to go camping so you can improve your skills.
Two months prior: Maintain your routines. Increase the length of aerobic workouts. Improve your endurance. Rather than focusing on how heavy you can lift, tone down the weight and see how many reps you can do in a minute. Get out in the wilderness and test out your gear. Remember to maintain a healthy diet and drink lots of water.;
, To climb Mount Everest you will need to understand mountaineering, climbing and navigational skills. Taking outdoor and navigational classes will help you. Your Everest expedition guide will also help you prepare for the mountain. Have a good understanding of bushwhacking, rope handling, river crossings, belaying and tying knots, rappelling, navigation, crevasse and rock rescue skills. Merely taking care of urinating and bowel movements requires special techniques and extreme care in the low temperatures.

, The most common ways of dying on the mountain are fatigue, ice falls, lack of oxygen, high altitudes, harsh weather conditions and frostbite. Learn from the mistakes made by other climbers and understand the symptoms of altitude sickness, and its prevention techniques and emergency treatments.

, Above 8,000 metres (26,000 ft) you will face significant challenges to survival. Any body part exposed will suffer frostbite. The temperature is so low that the ice is an extreme slipping hazard. The oxygen level is only 337 mbar, a third of the requirement normally needed to breathe. The conditions are so harsh it takes most climbers up to 12 hours to walk the distance of 1.72 kilometres (1 mile) from South Col to the summit. To live in the death zone you will need about 50 days of altitude acclimatization for a typical expedition, otherwise you will lose consciousness in minutes.


Since helicopters can't easily reach the summit, if you become unable to walk you will be left to die. It is not uncommon to come across dead bodies in the mountain.

, Even if you think you know everything, you probably don't. Have at least 3 years of mountaineering experience. Practise climbing other mountains that have high altitudes and extreme temperatures.

, Most expedition companies take groups of around 10 people with numerous Sherpas and several travel guides. The tour company will take care of your climbing permits and oxygen supplies. Sherpas are native to the Himalayan mountains of Nepal who will carry your food, load and equipment. They can also offer you support and help climbing the mountain. Expect to pay at least $60,000 for the expedition.


Paying for a budget tour or not using a company at all puts your life more at risk. Generally the more you pay, the safer your climb will be. Hundreds of climbers who paid minimal prices have died.

, You will need to ask your expedition company for a list of equipment you will need bring. You will need mountaineering equipment such as ice axes and crampons, clothing such as gloves and headwear, and supplies such as food, a stove to thaw water and the food, and first aid materials.

, Allow 6 to 8 days to complete the walk. The time consuming walk is beneficial as it will help you get used to the high altitudes. This camp is 5,380 m (17,700 ft). It is typical to spend a few days at the base camp to get used to the low oxygen levels so you will avoid altitude sickness. During your stay Sherpas will prepare ropes and ladders for the next part of your journey.

, The icefall is a moving glacier mass of tumbled ice with deep crevasses. It is best to start before dawn so that the freezing temperatures will weld the ice tightly together. Proceed to Camp I which is at an altitude of 6,065 m (19,900 ft).

, The most direct route is gashed by deep ice and massive crevasses. The Western Cwm is a flat, gently rising glacial valley. You will arrive at the base of Lhotse face at Camp II or Advanced Base Camp (ABC) which is at an elevation of 6,500 m (21,000 ft).

, This face is icy; so, you will need to use the fixed ropes which are permanently in place. They interlink so that you are constantly connected to a rope. The steep slopes of up to 50 degrees and hard ice make it easy for your crampons to slip. Camp III is at an altitude of 7,470 m (24,500 ft).

, The spur is a big, black rib or rock followed by hard yellow rock known as the Yellow Band. It was named by the 1952 Swiss expedition. There are fixed ropes to guide you in place. Camp IV (High Camp) is on the South Col which has an altitude of 7,920 m (26,000 ft).

, You will need to wait for clear weather and low winds, otherwise you will have to descend, many meters back to Base Camp. The final section of climbing to the top includes walking up a series or steps made from rock and walking along a knife-edged ridge to a 12 m (40 ft) wall called Hillary Step. Climb up the snow slope and you will reach the top of the summit which is highest point on earth at 8,848 m (29,029 ft).

, The route to the Advanced Base Camp (ABC) is 22 km (12 miles) is rugged and has lots of boulders, ice and snow. The path follows Rongbuk Glacier and then merges into Eastern Rongbuk Glacier. The ABC Camp is 6,400m (21,300 ft).

, When you reach the East Rongbuk Glacier you will have to use crampons for the first time. After a short walk you can attach yourself to a fixed rope. This part gains significant altitude and some parts will feel vertical. It takes about 5 hours to reach the North Col (Camp I) which is at an elevation of 7,000 m (23,000 ft).

, This section is known as the High Camps. The path is mostly snow with some rocks. This section is known for strong winds which prevail in the area. It takes about 4 hours to reach Camp II which is at an altitude of 7,500 m (24,750 ft). Many climbers use this camp for acclimatization purposes.

, Many climbers skip this camp and go directly to Camp IV. Camp III is at an altitude of 7,900 m (25,600 ft). Most climbers will need to sleep with supplemental oxygen. The route to the camp is extremely windy which means it can take you up to 6 hours to complete, however once you reach the camp you are protected by the North Face of the mountain. The camp is built on small rock ledges since there is not many open spaces on this part of the mountain.

, Follow the fixed rope through the snow filled gully. Then take the small ramp to the Northeast Ridge which is just under the camp. You do not want to spend a lot of time at the camp, it is basically just a rest stop. Camp IV is at an altitude of 8,300 m (27,390 ft).

, To get to the summit you will have to pass three rock features, called Three Steps. The first step requires hard pulling on fixed ropes to get over the Mushroom shaped rock. It is full of loose rock which is hard to walk over. The second step, the Chinese ladder is most intense. You will need to climb over a thick ice slab to climb on a vertical ladder with a 3,000 m (10,000 ft) drop. The third step is a straightforward rock climb, however under the extreme conditions it is very challenging.

, Along the final stretch it is extremely cold, steep and windy. Towards the top of the pyramid there are more small rocks which are challenging to get over. The Summit Ridge is very exposed and has steep slope angles of up to 60 degrees. It has drop-offs on both sides of 3,000 m (10,000 ft). At the end of the ridge you will reach the highest point on earth at 8,848 m (29,029 ft).

Determine what type of mountaineering boots you require.,
Select alpine boots for light 1 to 3 day mountain climbs.,
Choose expedition boots have an inner fully insulated boot that is removable for climbing above 15,000 feet (4.572 km).,
Obtain expedition and alpine boots at sports stores, ski shops, mountain expedition retailers, or online.,
Try boots on with 1 mid-weight sock.",How to Choose Mountaineering Boots," Mountaineering boots are heavier than hiking boots and are rigid to support a crampon (climbing gear that attaches to the bottom of the boot).;
, Alpine mountaineering boots are made from leather and won't keep your feet warm in frigid weather. When choosing mountaineering boots, consider the temperature.


If you will be climbing on ice, you should select climbing boots with narrow, stiff soles with a full-shank. The shank is the metal or plastic plate installed in the sole. The narrow soles facilitate control while the full-shank provides support.
If you plan on rock climbing, select lighter alpine boots with more flex in the sole. A heavier boot with a thick sole makes it more difficult to move your feet precisely when scaling rocks.

,


You will require an expedition boot if you plan on spending more than 3 days on a snowy mountain peak. To keep your feet warm, you remove the inner boot and sleep with it at night, so in the morning, you have warm boots.
When choosing mountaineering boots, remember that expedition boots are made with plastic, and they are big, heavy and may be uncomfortable.

, If you shop online, be sure the retailer offers a full refund if the boots do not fit.

, If you can insert 2 fingers between your heel and the inner heel of the boot while your toes touch the end of the boot, you have a good fit.


If the boot pinches or rubs your foot, try on a larger size. When choosing mountaineering boots, you don't want boots that may cause blisters.
Expedition boots will feel snug when you initially try them on. The inner boot will compact after you wear them on a few trips.

If you can't find a permit for the day the you want to climb, check http://purmit.com/ for permits for sale that people purchased but aren't going to use.

, There is no fee for this time of year.

, You'll still need to purchase a permit, but it's the last weekend before permits are limited to 100 per day. It's a tradition for everyone (male and female) to wear a dress over their hiking gear.,,
Hike Mt. Defiance(the hard way) to get used to the elevation gain.

,
Know how much water you'll need, especially if it's hot.

, You'll be scrambling over boulders for a good chunk of the Mount St. Helens climb, so it's good to make sure you can handle this.

, You can do that here.

, It's not uncommon for the climb to take 10 hours. If you're climbing during summer, it's best to avoid going up during the hottest part of the day.

, Attach it securely to the outside of your pack. Sign in at the register.

, For people reading this article, that will probably be Climbers Bivouac.

, It's a pretty obvious trail, but it's also marked by blue triangular posts on trees for those hiking it in the winter. You'll gain around 900 feet (274.3 m) in elevation in these first two miles, which is the easy part of this hike.

, Soon after that, there is an outhouse toilet. The rest of the hike will be exposed, so it will be hard to find a private place to do your business. Use this toilet if that's a concern of yours.

, The trees will disappear and you'll need to use the wooden posts to guide your way for the rest of the climb. You've just crossed the timberline, and into the part of the climb that requires a permit.

, There will be many little trails--just keep following the posts.

, The rock piles will turn back into a trail when you're close. This part is grueling. Just keep at it. There's no mistaking when you've reached the top; take a few steps further and you'll risk falling right into the crater!


If there is any snow at the crater, do not step out to the edge. The snow forms into cornices which can easily collapse under you and result in death.

, Many people choose to slide down the snow patches in their waterproof rain pants. It's a lot like sledding, just be careful. Most accidents occur when people glissading cannot control their speed and stop: Most climber deaths are due to glissading."

Mount the scope on the rifle if you haven't already.,
Create a target.,
Line up the front sight with the target and stabilize the gun.,
Line up the scope.,
Sight in the rifle at the gun range.",How to Bore Sight a Rifle," If your rifle is not already equipped with hardware for mounting a scope, you will need to install scope mounts. Most modern rifles come with screw hole pre-drilled and tapped for scope mount installation. Install mounts and make sure they are secure.


After your mounts are installed and hardware is tightened, install scope rings on the scope itself and leave loose enough to adjust their position. You will need to be able to rotate the scope and to move it back and forth after mounting on the rifle.
Make adjustments as needed so that the horizontal line on the reticle is level. You will also need to adjust the eye relief on the scope. While keeping the gun in a comfortable shooting position, move the scope forward or backward until there is no black ring around the objective. It's also important to make sure you have enough eye relief that the scope will not contact your face due to recoil.;
, A bright red dot is an effective way of bore-sighting. It needs to stand out and be clearly visible with both kinds of sights, so it helps to use something very specific with high contrast, roughly 100 yards (91.4 m) away for the optimum sighting.You're not going to be shooting at the target, just lining up the sights, so this is a perfectly fine thing to do indoors, if you've got the space for it. Just practice good gun safety, as always, checking and double checking to make sure that your gun is unloaded before you try to bore sight it.

, A gun vise would be ideal for the job, but any kind of bench or other stabilizer would be handy for keeping the gun level while you make the adjustments necessary. Obtain a good sight picture with the front sight, keeping the gun level., After the sight is leveled and the eye relief is set, tighten your scope rings and re-check all hardware to make sure it is secure, then line up the cross-hairs on the scope with the target, keeping a good sight picture and your eye at the appropriate distance from the scope. Adjust the elevation and windage on the scope until it's lined up as closely as possible.


What you're looking for is having a perfect sight picture when you're looking through the end sight at the appropriate cheek-weld and sight picture, while at the same time you could look through the scope at the appropriate distance and be lined up with the exact same spot. It's very difficult to do this without a gun vise or some other kind of secure stabilizer, so you can make your adjustments without holding or moving the gun.

, It's still important to take your rifle to the range and go through a few practice rounds to get the feel of the scope and make small adjustments as necessary. Each gun is slightly different, no matter how accurate, so take some time to get used to it and sight it in properly.

Get the necessary gear for the climb.",How to Buy Your Way onto a Mount Everest Expedition," You will be spending lots of money and lots of time on the expedition, up to 60 days in Nepal total, from arrival to the climb and then the return home, so you should try to find an experienced mountain climbing company who have a high track record of successful climbs. Call several mountain climbing companies who specialize in Everest climbs and ask them how their season went. Look for companies that have a high success rate of climbers who made the summit and over 80% of climbers reaching the summit, if not scaling it completely.Recent expeditions to Everest have not occurred or been postponed due to natural disasters and poor weather. You should confirm the companies have expeditions for the year you would like to book and the time frame. Most companies arrange expeditions between April and May when the wind is less severe on the mountain.;
, Usually the more services and one-on-one guidance you would like, the more expensive the expedition will be. Most companies will provide mountain professional guides, expedition permits, accommodation in the Kathmandu, all transportation to Nepal, yaks, porters, and guides to and from Base Camp, tents, showers, and toilet tents, weather reports, and oxygen for the altitude change on the mountain.However, not all companies provide one on one guides throughout the trip. Ask the company how many sherpas and guides they provide for each climb. Some companies provide one guide and one sherpa per a climber and other companies may offer one sherpa and one guide per two climbers.

, The cost of hiring a mountain climbing guide for Everest can vary depending on your budget. The total cost of climbing Everest can run into the tens of thousands, around $70,000, when you factor in the climbing permit, the gear, the airline tickets to Nepal, and the mountain guide fee. You should determine how much you are willing to spend on the expedition before you start to compare the prices of different guiding companies, as you may be able to find a guiding company that still offers you what you require but does not break your budget., Before you hire a climbing company for the Everest expedition, you should compare rates and services between several companies. If you are looking for one on one guides, you may end up paying more for this service through a specific company. However, if you are looking for a less guided experience, you may pay less through another company.


Keep in mind Everest can be a fatal situation if you do not have the right training, the right gear, and a good guide. Avoid cheaping out on guiding services if it means you may be risking your life, as it will be worth it if you can make it to the summit alive and well.

, Once you have chosen the mountain guiding company for you, you should pay for the expedition and book your spot. Determine your expedition date and book your flights to Nepal. Then, focus on training properly at least six months before your expedition date so you are prepared and ready to take on Everest.

, Climbing Everest is a serious endeavor that requires peak physical and mental fitness. When you are on your expedition, you will need to be able to hike steep outdoor trails with a pack that can weigh 22-30 kilograms for two to three hour periods. You will also need to be comfortable hiking in thick winter gear and heavy boots. To prepare for the expedition, you should commit to a strict training program at least six months before your expedition date so you are physically and mentally prepared for the climb.Begin your training program by starting out with a moderate level of exercise, four to five times a week. You can then progress over the period of six months until you are at peak fitness. The idea is to work your way up to peak fitness and not overwork or over stress your body.

, It is essential that you do cardiovascular training and conditioning at least one year to six months before your planned expedition to build up strength and endurance. Start your training by committing to a regular workout routine where you are training at least four to five times a week. You should get to the point where you can do your workout and not ache the next day.You should do some form of cardiovascular activity for at least 45-60 minutes, four to five times a week. Biking, running, swimming, and using the steppe machine at the gym are all good options. Rest for one to two days or do a fun physical activity on one of your rest days, like climbing, skiing or skating. Enlist the support of friends and do cardio activities together.
You should aim to get your heart rate to between thirty and forty beats faster per minute over a thirty-minute workout, also known as “conversation pace”, where you can talk to someone comfortably during the workout. As the months go on, you should try to improve your heart rate, increasing the duration of your cardio activities.

, You can do free weight exercises and follow an interval training program at home using free weights and an exercise mat. Start with free weight training three times a week and then work your way to four to five times a week. You should combine free weight training with cardio training to get the most out of your workouts. A typical workout week could look like:Monday: Cardio activity for thirty minutes (running, biking, rowing), strength training with sit ups, pull ups (15 reps, three sets), and push ups (40 reps, three sets). You can also incorporate weight training with free weights, such as bicep curls and military presses.
Tuesday: Different cardio activity for thirty minutes (running, biking, rowing) or longer. No strength workout.
Wednesday: Strength workout incorporating sit ups, pull ups, push ups, and free weights. Do more exercises than you did on Monday. Rest from cardio activity.
Thursday: Cardio activity for thirty minutes (running, biking, rowing) or longer. You can also go for an hour long hike or run on a trail outdoors instead. . No strength workout.
Friday: Cardio activity for thirty minutes or longer. Repeat Monday’s strength workout.
Saturday: Rest day or a fun recreational cardio activity like a hike or a climb.
Sunday: Rest day. No activity.
Always stretch before you do any exercise and drink lots of water before and after your workouts, about three to four quarts a day. Hydration is important for dealing with altitude affects when you are on Everest.

, It is recommended that you try to do at least one to two big climbs on mountains before you commit to climbing Everest. Many people who climb Everest will work their way up to bigger peaks over a period of one to two years before they commit to Everest.Having experience climbing high peaks will also allow you to develop the mental strength needed on a climb, as you may be faced with physical exhaustion and need to stay strong mentally to continue to climb. You should ask climbing friends for recommendations on big climbs you can do to prepare for the high altitude environment of Everest or talk to the mountain climbing company about climbs that may be useful as preparation for Everest.

, If the notion of training for Everest on your own seems too daunting, you can enroll in a training camp that focuses on preparing you mentally and physically for the expedition. Some of these training camps can be done through the mountain climbing company that you hire to take you on the Mt. Everest expedition. Ask the companies for rates on training programs and what will be covered in their training programs.


Most training camps can be done at a mountain climbing company in your area. These programs may simulate the experience of climbing Everest indoors or take you on climbs that are similar to Everest to prepare you for the expedition.

, Most climbing companies will expect climbers to have their own climbing gear and their own climbing packs. You should have enough supplies for two months on the mountain, with the goal of packing smart rather than packing light. The climbing companies may be able to provide a list of necessary gear and supplies for the climb. You should have:


Plastic, frost-proof clubbing boots
Two sets of thermal base layers
Down parka with a hood and down pants
At least six pairs of warm socks
Bandanas, a face mask and a balaclava, wool hats, a sun visor
Synthetic gloves and Gore-Tex mitts
Glacier glasses
A sleeping bag
A day pack and a backpack
A harness
An ice axe, a headlamp, and rappel gear
Food to last the duration of the expedition

Be a highly experienced mountaineer.,
Decide which summits you count as your Seven Summits.,
Read up on every Seven Summits summit that you're going to climb.,
Decide where you'll begin.,
Plan well in advance.,
Be very realistic.,
Move on to the Second Seven Summits.",How to Tackle the Seven Summits," The Seven Summit mountains are not for any climber other than the well-seasoned one with plenty of climbs already achieved. If you haven't already trained at the following mountains, get started with these ones first:


The Matterhorn – Swiss and Italian border mountain. It has sheer faces, lots of awful weather, and many an avalanche or rock fall. Ideal training ground. The southern face is the most challenging.
Mount Thor – Baffin Island, Nunavut. With the longest vertical cliff in the world, this will definitely test your technical climbing skills to their limits.
Eiger – Swiss Alps. Lots of people have climbed this one over time but the North Face wasn't climbed until 1938. It's a busier climb and some of it has rock fall risks.
Ben Nevis – UK. The north face cliffs provide a good place for training.;
, There is some dispute over a few of the summits, so you'll need to make up your own mind as to what constitutes the Seven Summits by reading what others have tackled, looking at lists of climbers who have done the Seven Summits, etc. The seven climbs are usually considered to be:



Mt Everest, Nepal-Tibet border, highest mountain climb in world, also the most difficult of the seven

Kilimanjaro, Africa
Mt McKinley (Denali), Alaska, USA
Elbrus, Caucus Mountains (see ""Tips"" though) or Mont Blanc in the Graian Alps of Europe

Aconcagua in the Argentinian Andes
Oceania: either Kosciusko, Australia (Oceania) - an easy day hike most walkers can manage, without oxygen; or Puncak Jaya (Carstensz Pyramid), New Guinea (Oceania)
Mt Vinson in the Vinson Massif, Antarctica.

, Get maps, guidebooks, books by those who have climbed, etc., and learn as much as you can about the mountains. Know well in advance if you have the requisite climbing abilities from rock climbing skills to ice climbing, as well as your usual mountain climbing expertise. Learn about specific challenges and quirks, weather issues, where to base camp, how to get in and out, and the costs involved.

, There are obviously seven choices and your ability to climb then in any particular order will be dependent on a number of factors including weather, season, transport access, costs, etc. It is also probably a good idea to start with the easiest and work your way up the scale! Most people begin with Kilimanjaro, which is an easy climb but can have altitude effects.Kosciusko and Elbrus are also easy climbs.Proceed to Mt. Vinson and Denali next, followed by the technically difficult Everest and Puncak Jaya., As well as the obvious climbing skills needed, there are many other things to take into consideration, including vaccinations, carriage of your equipment (including oxygen), accommodation, transport, visas or permits, medical insurance and transport, and so forth. Keep detailed lists of all the things you need to acquire and do and check them off methodically as you prepare.

, The difficulties of climbing all seven summits are enormous. Not only are many of the climbs technically difficult (although some are easier than others), the costs involved in getting to them and having all the right equipment, etc., are high. Plus, you need to consider the wishes of family and friends, who will express their worries to you, and understandably so.


If you an amateur to intermediate climber, don't even consider climbing some of the training or Seven Summit mountains. It is too dangerous. Keep learning and building up your skills and perhaps some day you'll be advanced enough.
The expenses are tremendous. ""Is this the best use of my savings?"" is a question you should constantly ask yourself. Even if you manage to get to most of the continents, getting to Antarctica can involve prohibitive costs.

, If you're still hankering for more adventure, or if the Seven Summits don't really grab your interest, consider the Second Seven Summits originally cited by Jon Krakauer.Some of these, like K2, are technically more difficult.

It is as important to understand the mental effort required to climb a mountain as it is to be fit, and know how to use the equipment properly, and one of the best ways of understanding this is to read the stories of mountaineers who have climbed challenging, interesting, or many mountains. Many bookstores now carry sections specifically devoted to the craft of mountain climbing, so it won't be hard to find good books.


A good starter book is the one by Steve M Cox and Kris Fulaas, Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills.
Watch DVDs about mountain climbing experiences. There are many good documentaries and movies focused on mountain climbing available.






Learn about the best times to climb mountains in different regions of the world. If you're able to and interested in traveling to mountains beyond your own country, this can open up more opportunities with differing alpine seasons around the world. For example, the best climbing in Europe is June to September, in New Zealand it's December to March, and in Alaska it's June and July. Within these generalized climbing seasons there are marked variations of suitability dependent on the amount of people climbing, the weather variations that cannot be predicted until they occur and the reality that some seasons are good and some are bad.
Learn all that you can about weather conditions and mountains. Mountains create their own weather systems (micro-climates). Learn how to read portents of bad weather, how to read the clouds, how to test wind direction, and understand what weather changes throughout the day mean for your climb. Learn how to respond to lightning strikes.;
, A lot of mountain climbing is about your mental attitude because you will need to make sound, fast judgments about conditions, directions, and safety. For many mountaineers, the mental challenge is a large part of the allure because you are taken completely out of your usual routine of air-conditioned offices and easy lifestyles into a world where decision-making has major consequences and you're thoroughly tested. Some things to ask yourself include:Do you panic easily or resort to making rash decisions? This kind of temperament is dangerous when climbing a mountain, which needs a steady head, calm and clear thinking, and an ability to work out the best solution quickly.
Are you able to push past pain barriers or do you prefer to give up and find something else less strenuous to do?
Are you positive by nature but also realistic and honest with yourself? Overconfidence is not desirable as it can lead you into severe trouble when climbing.
Are you a good problem-solver?

, Mountain climbing requires good fitness and endurance skills because it is an intensely demanding physical activity. You can't simply turn up for a big climb after a relatively sedentary office desk lifestyle. Train for fitness and strength in ways that benefit you best. The types of fitness regimes that might help you include:


Running and jogging, including endurance running.
Walking and hiking, with the hiking become increasingly arduous, perhaps including scrambling.

Weightlifting, or walking and running with weights in a backpack or held in your hands as you go uphill.

Climbing practice - local walls, ice climbing lessons and glacier walking can all be useful training.
Skiing and snowboarding (especially if you intend to use these as means for returning after a climb, which is really extreme but possible on some mountains).
Anything that improves strength and endurance, the two essentials for peak physical fitness when mountain climbing.

, Mountain climbing gear is very specific and absolutely essential. You have two options – buying your own or hiring it. If you decide to purchase your own, this will be initially expensive but if done gradually, it's a good option as you can be sure everything is fitted to you exactly, and if you plan on climbing more than one mountain, it's a good investment. If you're hiring gear, you won't be guaranteed ideal fit and the items will obviously be used but if you use a reputable outfitter, they will be able to provide quality, tested items. It's probably a good idea to hire for the first experience to see if you even enjoy mountain climbing, and then decide whether or not to start assembling your own gear. Even with hiring, there will still be items you need to purchase for yourself, such as your wick-away clothing layers, and perhaps your boots, as clothing items are far more important to get fitted properly than the ice axe or the crampons, etc.


See the list under ""Things You'll Need"" for a good starting list of equipment.
Be aware that mountaineers are obsessed with weight, and with good reason. You have to carry everything with you all the way up that mountain. Be loaded down by inessential gear is not an option for a mountain-climber and mountaineers are always looking for ways to cut weight without cutting corners on safety. This can increase costs as lightweight materials like titanium will cost more than their heavier counterparts.

, Knowing how to climb a mountain isn't just about the physical and mental aspects. Many mountains are located in remote areas of the world and your climbing can have an impact on the local environment. It is a privilege to be able to climb pristine mountains and most mountaineers are very concerned to keep mountains in their original condition, as well as not abusing local amenities or running roughshod over local cultures.


Learn the Leave No Trace set of principles.Tread softly, be an advocate for wilderness protection, and obtain all necessary permits.
Read the Climbing Code. This code was developed for safety purposes and is essential reading for beginners.No mountain climb should ever be attempted alone; at the very least, climb with friends who have already climbed mountains.

, If you intend on doing your first climb as a course for beginners, then the course will serve as your initial training. On the other hand, if you're planning to climb with a companion, you may need to undertake some basic training before setting off unless you're prepared to ""learn as you go"" with your guide. A mountain club can offer you specialized courses in such skills as (and you need to know them all):


Ice climbing, cutting ice steps, using the ice axe.
Self-arrest techniques.
Glissading (a descending technique) in which you slide down, using your ice axe to check your speed.
Crossing crevasses and crevasse rescue techniques, and crossing snow bridges.
Using your crampons, including putting them on, walking in them, and specific techniques, etc.

Glacier walking.
Various climbing techniques and skills, including route finding, map reading, using pitons, wedges, and bolts, knot tying, rope management and use (belaying, etc.)

Avalanche safety training. This is usually a distinct course and you can join courses offered in many places around the world, usually for skiers and snowboarders, but also some tailored to mountaineers and rescue professionals. This course is useful even if you don't keep up your mountain climbing but continue to participate in winter sports.

Basic first aid techniques and rescue signals should also be learned as part of your training.

, Your first ascent should be one suited to a beginner and preferably with an experienced guide. The level of difficulty of a mountain is affected by both its altitude and its terrain. Mountains are graded from easy to extremely difficult, with many gradations in between. A beginner mountaineer should always ascend an ""easy"" mountain to begin with, while still taking all necessary precautions because a mountain is still a mountain, no matter how ""easy"" it is considered. Different countries assign different grade systems, so you'll need to do a little research first. You'll also need to understand rock pitches (from very difficult to hard, very severe) and ice pitches if rock and ice pitches (alpine and waterfall ice) are an issue on the mountain sought to be climbed.


Try non-technical ""walk-up"" mountains to begin with, such as Mount Elbert and Mount Kilimanjaro. These will help you learn what it feels like to climb higher, to learn about weather changes, and to get a feel for the energy expended.
The ""where"" will be up to where you live and how much your budget stretches but it's recommended that you aim low for your first climb or climbs. That way, you'll start to get the feel for climbing, minor altitude changes, and you'll be able to spend more time concentrating on technique rather than worrying about exposure, oxygen deprivation, and lack of skills to cope. Remember that every climb can be that little bit harder and higher, so don't try to overdo it to begin with.
Research the intended climb well. Check out the region, the weather patterns for the time of year you're intending to climb, the known hazards, and each possible way of ascending the mountain. For a beginner, always choose the routes most recommended for the easiest climb, and ask guides or locals if this is not clear.
Find out what service huts and other amenities are available at the base and along the way. Find out what rules there are about using facilities and payments required.
Find maps of the climb and learn all that you can about the routes. Maps should always accompany you on a climb; trim the edges if you're worried about added weight.

, Next, try glaciated peak mountains which require gear and basic mountain technical skills. Volcanoes tend to form great beginner mountains of this type and with basic training, you should be able to accomplish them easily. Examples include Mt. Blanc, Mt. Rainier, Mt. Baker, and volcanoes in Ecuador and Mexico, as well as trekking mountains in Nepal. Grand Teton and Mt. Stuart can be climbed at this stage if you have good rock-climbing skills.


Move on to expedition peaks which require long walk-ins, good technical climbing skills, and all-round mountaineering knowledge. From here, the sky is the limit.

, One of the best things you can do is to join a mountain climbing club near you. From this club, you'll soon connect into other clubs through a shared network and you'll be able to find good, trusted, and reputable guides through clubs. The great thing about clubs is that they will arrange group climbs, which are often targeted at beginner to intermediate climbers, so you can learn the skills while having fun meeting other like-minded climbers.


Spend time talking to experienced climbers in club meetings. They can tell you a great deal more than you'll ever learn just from reading, and they may even end up offering to mentor you or at least put you on to the right people who can help you on your way.
Climbing clubs tend to tackle more technically difficult mountains than commercial outfitters. As your climbing skills improve, bear this in mind when you want to extend your abilities.

, If your mountain is close by, there will be less to arrange than if it requires travel to reach. If you don't live near mountains, you'll need to travel and book accommodation, and if this travel includes flying overseas, you'll also need to take into account baggage allowances and visa requirements, etc. In both cases, consider ensuring that you have insurance for equipment loss, and for medical evacuation, injury, and death.


Pack your gear with care. If your ice axe, crampons, boots, and other gear need to fly, pack with great care. Some of these items can tear through bags easily and rip other people's stuff or falling out and getting lost. When driving, be sure to place your gear in a safe place to prevent it flying forward if you have to brake suddenly.
Check whether you need permits. Many popular mountains now require permits for safety, control, and environmental reasons.
Even if a permit is not required, you should always find out where to leave details of your intended journey and make sure to leave your departure and expected return times with local officials who have responsibility for the mountain area, as well as with family and friends.

, Prior to the climb, it is usual to set up a base camp. If you're climbing with a course, they may have a permanent hut at base camp, so inquire when booking your course. The base camp serves as the departure point and you can sometimes spend considerable time here just waiting for weather improvements, depending on the difficulty of the mountain and the climb. For less treacherous mountains, base camp may be merely the first night's stop off before you head off for the climb with your companion or group.


Use this time to double and triple check your gear. Check that you have everything you need (taking a list is helpful) and check that everything is in good working order.
Check any other supplies required, such as food, water, clothing, etc.
Spend time talking to your guide or companion about the route and what's to be expected by way of hazards, weather conditions, likely problem areas, and any other issues needing to be covered. Look over your map of the area and know the route well in your mind. Look for any other possible routes that might be needed as safety exits should anything go wrong.
Exercise by stretching, walking, running, etc. – whatever you usually do to continue staying fit.
Eat a good meal and get to bed early.

, This step is simply an overview, for the actual climb requires many different techniques and is contextual to the mountain. This is where reading detailed books about your intended mountain climb is invaluable, along with talking to climbers who have already climbed it. Most climbs begin very early in the morning to ensure that you have time to come back down before darkness, or if you're sleeping on the mountain, to ensure you reach a suitable place for sleeping each night. After checking you have everything you need (which you should have packed the night before), and having a hearty breakfast, set out on your climb with your guide or experienced companion. Put into action all of the skills that you have trained for before reaching this mountain.


Stick to your route unless there are major encumbrances preventing you from doing so.
Follow what your guide asks you to do. As a beginner, heed the wisdom of the experienced while still using your own judgment and being responsible.
Take regular short breaks to eat energy foods, rest briefly and to assess your direction. However, don't linger too long where you cool down too much.
Keep hydrated. It's easy to dehydrate in the cold because your body doesn't seem thirsty, so be sure to keep drinking fluids regularly.
Stay with the other climbers at all times.
Enjoy the summit. Take photos and feel proud.

, Be aware that the descent is hard and dangerous. While it may seem easier than going up, this is the time that accidents are most likely to occur, and when concentration tends to lapse.


Stay focused on finding good footholds when scrambling, and climbing down.
Scramble where it is safe to do so. It is faster and easier to scramble facing out.
Be very careful when abseiling; end-of-the-day abseiling tends to have high accident rates because people get tired, misplace anchors, have slings break, and generally don't stay as alert as is needed.
Keep falling rocks, avalanches, and weakened snow and snow bridges in mind as you descend.
Keep roped. It might feel like you're almost at the base when crossing that last glacier but if you're un-roped and fall down a crevasse, that's it.

Check to see if the ignition is working.,
Place an orange in the barrel on the side with the outside threads.,
Spray the hair spray into the end cap chamber.

,
Quickly screw the end cap to the end of the barrel to hold in the spray.,
To fire the orange cannon, hold the gun tightly and use the grill igniter apply charge to the nails.

",How to Build an Orange Cannon," The barrel portion should be at least 24 inches (61.0 cm), but advanced users are encouraged to try various lengths and observe the results.;
, This will be the ignition chamber end of the gun.

, One nail should go on one side, and the other directly across on the opposite side of the chamber. There should be around ¼ in of space between the two nail tips.

, This is most easily accomplished by stripping a section of each wire and then tightly winding the wire around each of your contact points, in this case two nails. Remember, one wire per nail.

, To do this, remove the end cap and watch the nails for a spark when you press the ignition button. If you see the spark, you’re ready to start shooting.

,


Warning: Be ready to fire right away after loading and preparing the gun. Leaving the gun loaded for longer periods of time increases the chance for accident and injury.

,,


Warning: Make sure the cannon is not pointed towards any people! Have a set target in mind and know what is around it.

Check the function.,
Lower receiver is now complete.",How to Build an AR 151," Install the clutch spring. First, insert the magazine catch spring on the left side of the lower receiver. You will know the left side of the receiver because it has all the writing on it. Then from the right side of the lower receiver install the magazine catch spring. Last, push the magazine catch button towards the magazine catch, and spin to tighten. Spin until the magazine catch is flush or nearly flush with the button.;
, Before you start, use some masking tape to cover the lower receiver just to the right of where you install the bolt catch. This masking tape will prevent scratches when you tap in the bolt catch roll pin.


First, insert the roll pin and tap it in part way. Second, insert the bolt catch spring and buffer. When you do this the spring should face in, and the buffer out. Now you are ready to install the bolt catch.
Hold the spring tension on the plunger, and align the hole in the bolt release with the roll pinhole in the lower receiver. Use a punch to tap the pin all the way in. Alternatively you could use a pair of pliers and press the pin in.
If your bolt catch is sticky after installation there is a problem. The hole in the bolt catch should be large enough that the bolt catch release pin can pass through. If you have this problem, you can do one of two things:

Call your vendor and get a replacement part.
Ream out the hole with a tiny drill, or grind it with a Dremel or very small round needle file.



, First, insert the spring in the detent hole, next insert the detent. Note that you will need to force the detent in against the spring. While the detent is in, use the pivot pin to hold the detent back down in its hole against the spring, as you insert the pivot pin in its hole in the lower receiver. When in, the pivot pin will hold the detent in place.

, Slip the trigger guard between the support ears on your receiver. Gently tap the roll pin in place. Be careful that the hole in the trigger guard stays aligned with the holes in the two ears on the receiver, as you tap in the pin. If the holes are misaligned you will bend your pin.

, Drop the trigger and the trigger spring assembly into the lower receiver. Push the disconnector over the coil spring. Then insert a trigger pin through the lower receiver, through the disconnector, and to the other side of the receiver. You may have to wiggle it a little, but it will go.

, Insert the hammer and hammer spring assembly into the lower receiver. The two long legs of the hammer spring will rest on the top of the pin installed in the ""Install the trigger"" step. Push the hammer into the receiver until the holes in the hammer line up with the holes in the receiver. Then lightly tap the pins in. Cock the hammer.


Note that the hammer is under tension, so you will have to push/squeeze the hammer in to get the pin holes to line up.

, To install the safety selector, place the selector detent and the spring into the detent hole.

, When installing the pistol grip make sure that the selector spring goes into the hole in the grip.

, Install the detent and the spring, then install the pin in the rear of the receiver. Note that this rear pin will be held in place when you install the stock in the next step.

, Thread the rifle/carbine buffer tube into the receiver. Do this slowly and carefully, thread until just to the buffer hole. Then insert the buffer pin and buffer spring into the buffer stop. After the buffer pin and spring is in, thread some more. Go until the rifle/carbine tube holds the rear takedown pin in place. Note, the rifle/carbine tube should hold the pin in place but it should not touch the center of the pin and bind the pin's movement.


Whether you have a CAR nut or a castle nut, you can use a CAR wrench to tighten the stock.
You may choose to add a drop or two of loctite to the threads of the nut before tightening. This is optional, and if you plan on disassemble soon, you may choose not to do this.

, Cock the hammer; insert the spring, and then the buffer. Push the buffer in past the buffer pin.

, Perform a trigger mechanism check as follows :


Verify that hammer locks to the rear when pushed back.
Verify that hammer pivots forward when trigger is pressed.
Without releasing the trigger, push the hammer back again and verify that it locks (caught by disconnector).
Releasing the trigger should not cause the hammer to pivot fully forward (caught by trigger).
Hammer will fall when trigger is pressed.

, Your lower receiver is now complete or assembled, and ready for an assembled upper receiver.


It is important, that you do not ""dry fire"" your completed lower receiver by itself. Doing so may damage the lower. Wait until you have assembled your lower receiver with your upper receiver. Only then, when your firearm is fully assembled is dry firing okay.

Check the status of the delta ring on your barrel.,
Install the flash suppressor.,
Install the barrel.,
Thread on the barrel nut.,
Insert gas tube.,
Install the handguards.,
Check your assembly.,
Upper receiver is now complete.",How to Build an AR 152," Your upper receiver may already have this installed, if so, you may skip this step. If not, follow the instructions below on how to install the ejection port cover:


Place the upper receiver on its left side.
Prepare the hinge pin. To do this, use your needle nose pliers to install the snap ring under the cut on the hinge pin.
Install the pin where the clip is located on your lower receiver.
Next lay your ejection port cover into position on your lower receiver. Slide the hinge pin into the first cover holes. Pause when at the middle to install the spring.

To properly install the spring, you will need to twist the spring 180 degrees to insure the right tension. Places the twisted spring onto the hinge pin, and install one leg of the spring into the notch in the ejection port cover.


Slide the hinge pin the rest of the way, through the second set of holes in the ejection-port cover, and into the receiver. Your ejection port cover is now assembled. Test it, it should snap shut and spring open.

, First, clean the surface of your barrel and the threaded area of the upper receiver. You can clean them with gunscrubber or brake part cleaner. Next apply a little molybdenum-disulfide grease to the threads of the upper receiver.

, The delta ring is a collar like fastener around the barrel . Most of the time your barrel will already have the delta ring installed, as part of the barrel nut assembly. The barrel nut assembly consists of the barrel nut, delta ring, weld springs, and snap ring. If your receiver does not already have this assembly, here is how to install the barrel nut assembly:


Put the delta ring on the barrel, with the tapered end of the delta ring facing the muzzle.
Push the tapered end of the delta ring over the back end of the barrel nut.
Place the weld spring assembly over the barrel nut shank.
Install the snap ring behind the weld spring. Push the snap ring forward so that it compresses the weld springs, and use snap ring pliers to snap the ring around the barrel nut shank. Once this is done your barrel has a completed barrel nut assembly and you can continue.

, Before starting, clamp your barrel into your barrel vise block; or alternatively, wrap your barrel in a length of rope and clamp the rope-protected barrel into a bench vise.


Once in the vice, place a crush washer over the muzzle threads. Note that the tapered end of the crush washer should face the muzzle. Tighten the flash suppressor by hand as far as possible.
Next with the barrel still securely fastened within the vise, use a barrel wrench to tighten the suppressor firmly into place.

Note, if using an A2 suppressor, make sure that the bottom of the suppressor is properly timed. An A2 suppressor when properly installed will have no slots at the barrel's 6 o'clock position. However, if you are using an A1 suppressor, just tighten it so that the wrench flat lies in the horizontal position.



, Look for the locator stud or ""barrel stud"" on the barrel. This stud will fit into a notch on the upper receiver called the ""receiver notch"". Slide the barrel into the upper receiver so that the barrel stud engages the receiver notch.


Make sure that the stud and notch are aligned. If the stud and notch are aligned, the front and rear sights should also align.
If there is any play in the notch/stud alignment, do your best to line up the front sight with the rear sight.
If the alignment is not ideal, you may choose to file the notch a little to achieve optimal alignment of the front and rear sights. However, you should not cut anything to make the alignment to work.

, Be careful that you do not cross thread or strip your nut. Use your armorer's tool or fingers to snug the nut. Do not tighten all the way just yet.


Check that the spring and the snap ring are aligned. If they are not aligned, use a small screwdriver to align the weld spring and snap ring. They need to be aligned so that the gas tube can slide through.
If the alignment is good, then proceed to secure the barrel nut. Continue to tighten the barrel nut to 50–70 foot (15.2–21.3 m) pounds with a barrel nut wrench or armorer's tool until the lugs line up with the gas tube hole in the receiver.
To keep the spring/snap assembly from spinning as you tighten the nut, insert a short piece of gas tube or a 3/16"" bar into the receiver.

, Make sure your gas tube is correctly orientated. The side of the gas tube that is drilled for the retaining roll pin should be nearest to the muzzle.


Slide the gas tube towards the front sight block. Then slide the gas tube through the barrel nut assembly and into the upper receiver.
Once the rear of the gas tube is inside the upper receiver. Grasp the front of the gas tube and pull it forward. Insert the front of the gas tube into the front sight block.
Make sure that the gas tube hole faces down over the gas port.
Align the gas tube so that the gas tube roll pin holes line up with the roll pin holes on the side of the front sight block. Pick up the roll pin with a toothpick and start it into the front sight roll pinhole. Use the roll pin punch and a small hammer to gently tap the pin home. The gas tube is now installed.

, Push back on the delta ring. You may need a friend to help you push down on the delta ring and install the handguards. Alternatively, you may tap the handguards in place with a rubber hammer. But be gentle if you use a hammer.

, Before you assemble your lower and upper receivers you want to check your upper receiver assembly, specifically the bolt carrier.


Take the bolt carrier and slide it back and forth inside the upper receiver. If you have done everything correctly the bolt carrier will slide back and forth effortlessly. If the bolt carrier key binds against the gas tube, then something is wrong. If there is binding, then you will need to disassemble your upper receiver and start over. If the bolt carrier slides back and forth freely, then you can continue to the final assembly.

, Your upper receiver is now complete or assembled, and ready for an assembled lower receiver.

, Check that the rear takedown pin, from the ""Install rear takedown pin"" step, is extended. Bring the upper receiver down to mate with the lower receiver, and slide the pin through .

, You now have an AR-15. Go out and enjoy your hard work.

Have an aptitude for learning technical skills.,
Be interested in the history and production of guns.,
Be serious about gun safety.",How to Become a Gunsmith1," Guns must be designed and built to exacting specifications in order to function safely and properly. Gunsmiths must be proficient in working with wood, metal, and other shop materials to create an intricate piece of equipment.


Math skills are important for gunsmiths, since they must measure and cut wood and metal.
Gunsmiths have excellent wood and metalworking skills. They know how to use shop equipment such as lathes, drill presses, precision measuring instruments, files and chisels, and other tools of the trade.
Gunsmiths have mechanical expertise. They understand the way the individual moving parts in a gun work together, and are able to identify the problem when a gun isn't working correctly.;
, Gunsmiths understand that they are building on gunsmithing knowledge that has evolved over several hundred years. They're familiar with old and new gun models, manufacturers, and accessories.

Gunsmiths are often collectors or hobbyists who have the desire to craft guns on their own.






Many gunsmiths are members of organizations like the National Rifle Association, or attend conferences, trade shows and other events to congregate with other gunsmiths and learn more information about guns.

, Licensed gunsmiths know the importance of handling guns according to standard gun safety rules and the laws in their region.


Gun safety extends to the crafting of the gun itself, since a faulty gun could be unsafe for the user.

Dip the gun parts in the bluing solution.,
Rinse off the bluing solution in cold water.,
Immerse the gun parts in boiling water.,
Immerse the treated parts in a bath of water-displacing oil.",How to Blue a Gun Barrel1," This is to remove any surface rust and other red oxides that would flake off during the process, as well as any pits or scratches that may exist. You can use either 000 steel wool or 600 to 1200-grit sandpaper to polish the metal., The chemicals that are used in the bluing process proper are caustic chemicals. Depending on which chemical you use to clean the gun metal prior to bluing it, it may be caustic as well. In addition to wearing rubber gloves when working with these chemicals, it’s helpful to rig up the parts before dipping so they can be easily removed from the bluing bath.


Cut a length of soft wire longer than the gun barrel so that it is long enough to protrude from either end. After threading the wire through the barrel, bend both ends into hooks that can be grasped without touching the barrel and be suspended on hooks or a length of cord or wire outside of the chemical baths.
Smaller parts can be held in a stainless steel basket.

, Parts should be immersed in the bath for 10 to 15 minutes and scrubbed while being immersed to remove any oil, dirt, or grease that could get in the way of the bluing process. You can use any of the following chemical cleaners, provided you read and follow all directions for its use, handling, and disposal:


One chemical cleaner that was reportedly discontinued contained sodium metasilicate, found in a number of commercial floor strippers.A cleaner that can be used in its place is sodium triphosphate, a component of a number of commercial detergents.Some bluing product manufacturers recommend using naphtha, followed by washing the metal in a mild dishwashing detergent.Some hobbyist 'bluers' use a special cleaning oil, followed by acetone (nail polish remover) to clean the metal, while others use denatured alcohol.(One such cleaning oil, a mixture of mineral and vegetable oils, alcohol, alkaline salts, and benzyl acetate, is sold commercially under the name “Ballistol.”), Rinsing should take no more than 2 to 3 minutes.


If you’ve used dishwashing detergent to remove the cleaning chemical, you may instead need to use hot water to rinse., The bluing solution used in hot bluing is a caustic salt mixture of potassium nitrate and sodium hydroxide known as “Traditional Caustic Black.”This solution must be heated to a temperature of from 275 to 311 degrees F (135 to 155 degrees C), depending on the makeup of the bluing solution.


Before heating the bluing solution, stir it thoroughly to break up any clumps of bluing salt that may occur on the surface or at the bottom of the tank holding the solution.
When dipping gun barrels in bluing solution, dip them at an angle to allow any air bubbles that may form to escape. Be sure to immerse the barrel completely.
Swirl the metal basket containing smaller gun parts around in the solution to ensure the parts are completely coated with the bluing solution.
Leave the gun parts in the bluing solution from 15 to 30 minutes. Check to see when the metal has reached the desired shade of bluing and remove it from the solution at that time.
Stainless steel gun parts are immersed in a different chemical solution, this one made of a mixture of nitrates and chromates. It is heated to temperatures similar to the nitrate-hydroxide mixture., Swirl the parts through the cold water to help wash away the bluing salts.

, This will boil off any remaining bluing solution residue. Simple parts need to be immersed for 5 to 10 minutes, while complex or ornate parts may need to be immersed for up to 30 minutes.


If the gun has any soldered parts, you can apply a chemical to these parts that will color the soldering to match the rest of the metal. Use a cotton swab for this.

, This will protect the finish from rust, sweat, and body oil. Leave the parts in the oil bath for 45 to 60 minutes, until they have cooled."

Start early.,
Apply to a gunsmithing program at a college or trade school.,
Find an apprenticeship.,
Obtain a Federal Firearms License (FFL).",How to Become a Gunsmith2," Take industrial arts courses in high school such as machining, drafting and woodworking. These types of classes will form the basic skill set you need. If you've been out of high school for several years, take classes at a local community college to brush up on your skills.

, Most of these programs take between six months and two years. A list of accredited schools can be found on the on the NRA website.


Gunsmithing programs teach mechanical and tooling skills, the different functions and designs of various firearms, diagnosing and repairing guns, safety procedures, and in some cases chemistry and ballistics.
Consider enrolling in an online gunsmithing program, a popular alternative in recent years.
Gunsmithing programs always conduct background checks on their prospective students; those who don't pass are not admitted into the program.

, As an alternative or in addition to receiving a certification or diploma in gunsmithing, seek out a local gunsmith or apply through The Association of Gunsmiths and Related Trades (TAOGART) for apprenticeship status.


In order to apply through TAOGART you must be 16 or older. All applicants must be able to legally own and possess a firearm in compliance to federal and state laws.
If you are still in high school you must graduate and maintain at least a ""C"" average. You must have permission from your legal guardians and school officials (such as a principal or counselor).
A gunsmithing apprenticeship consists of on-site training and classroom instruction that totals about 8,000 hours. This time can vary depending on the type of firearm apprenticeship you undertake.

, This license differs from other firearms licenses in that it allows you to maintain possession of another person's firearm for more than a day, as you would do if you were repairing it.


In order to receive an FFL you must be over 21 years of age meet a number of strict gun safety requirements. A field agent will be dispatched to inspect your gunsmithing facilities and conduct an interview with you before the license is granted.
Apply for an FFL through the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). Check your local area for other licensing requirements.

Consider specializing in a certain type of gunsmithing.,
Consider working for a company.,
Apply for membership in a gunsmithing guild.",How to Become a Gunsmith3," Some gunsmiths have found success by focusing on one of the following areas:


Custom gun designing and building.
Stockmaking, which involves building the gun stock using wood.
Gun engraving, which adds aesthetic value to guns with decorative or patterned engravings in the wood or metal.
Pistolsmithing, which is practiced by people who custom design and build only pistols. Other gunsmiths focus primarily on rifles or shotguns.

, Operating one's own business can be difficult and risky, so some gunsmiths prefer to work for someone else. Gunsmiths are employed at sporting goods and firearms stores, firearms manufacturers, and armories.

, This can provide you with recognition and support. These associations also have scholarships for students going into the gunsmithing profession.

Polish the parts to be blued.,
Clean away any dirt, oil, or grease that remains chemically.,
Coat the gun metal parts with a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acid.,
Immerse the gun metal parts in boiling distilled water.,
Scrub away the red oxide rust that has formed, leaving the black oxide finish underneath.,
Repeat the acid treatment, boiling, and scrubbing until you have achieved the desired level of bluing.,
Coat the gun parts with oil.",How to Blue a Gun Barrel2," Again, steel wool or 600 to 1200-grit sandpaper will work to remove any loose rust, scarring, or pitting from the gun metal.


If you plan to remove the gun’s finish from the factory before bluing, some recommend using a phosphoric acid-based automotive rust remover to do so. Others use white vinegar, which contains acetic acid, for this purpose.

, The 19th-century gunsmiths who used this process likely did not have access to the chemicals used to clean gun metal for hot bluing, but the chemical cleaning improves the effectiveness of the bluing. You can use any of the chemicals described in the cleaning step for hot bluing and then rinse the cleaner off in the manner described in the rinsing step.

, The acid solution actually encourages the metal to rust, but to do so uniformly.


Instead of coating the parts with the acid solution, you can instead place an opened container of the acid solution with the gun parts in a cabinet and seal it for a period of 12 hours. The acid evaporates from its container and condenses around the gun metal. This method is called fume bluing.
Another variation is to coat the gun metal parts with the rust bluing solution and then put them into a fume cabinet (or, in this case, a damp cabinet) for the same 12 hours. Often, a first layer is applied as a primer before coating the parts a second time and then placing them in the damp cabinet., This stops the rusting process by removing the acid solution.

, The surface rust is normally removed with a carding brush or wheel, which features very soft and thin wire bristles.

, In some cases, the metal may develop as deep a coloring as it can, making further bluing treatments unnecessary and ineffective.

, The oil inhibits the formation of rust and protects the metal finish from dirt, sweat, body oil, and wear. Once you’ve applied the oil, let the parts stand overnight before assembling."
"
Polish and clean the gun metal.,
Heat the metal gently.,
Apply the bluing solution.,
Apply the solution several more times until you have the level of bluing you want.,
Season the finish with gun oil once you have the level of bluing you want.",How to Blue a Gun Barrel3," You can polish the metal with steel wool or sandpaper as you would with either of the other bluing processes, but how you choose to clean the metal depends on whether you plan to blue the entire gun or touch up existing bluing.


If you plan to blue the entire gun, you may want to immerse the metal in a cleaning solution as described for the hot bluing process.
If you plan to just touch up existing bluing, you can apply cleaning oil to the places where you want to remove the old bluing and prepare the metal for cold bluing. (The cleaning oil will dissolve existing bluing if applied excessively.) Use acetone on cotton balls to remove the cleaning oil. You may have some scarring from this process that will require sanding or polishing out.

, Although this process is called cold bluing, gently heating the gun metal before applying the bluing can help it absorb the bluing better and create a better finish. Heat the metal by leaving it out in the sun for several hours, with a heat gun or blow dryer, or in a conventional oven set to its lowest setting., Slowly apply the solution to the area to be blued as evenly as possible, using a clean applicator. Apply the solution in a single pass to cover small areas, or in sections no larger than 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5 cm) when covering large areas, then smooth it out using steel wool. This will prevent the bluing from appearing mottled. For applying the bluing to large areas, old all-cotton T-shirts or new toothbrushes are recommended. For smaller areas, use a cotton ball, cotton swab, or flat toothpick no larger than the area to be covered.
You can soak small parts like screws or hard to cover areas in the bluing solution. If you don’t have enough bluing solution to soak a recessed area, put it in a clean spray bottle and spray it liberally on the part over a glass pan or plastic tray. After the part is completely covered, you can pour the overspray back into the bottle and reuse it.

, Apply each layer with a fresh applicator, and use a fresh piece of steel wool to smooth out each new layer.


The more layers you apply the darker the bluing will be; however, each new layer is progressively less effective than the layer before it. Seven layers should be enough, in most cases, to achieve a dark blue-black finish. If you have spots that won’t darken, start the process over by sanding the spots with 320 to 400-grit sandpaper before applying the solution again. Try to sand no more than the stubborn spots themselves.

, Apply a layer of gun oil every few hours, using a cotton ball to remove the previous layer before applying a new layer. (In essence, you’re washing off the bluing solution with the gun oil instead of with water.)


Do not use the cleaning oil for this process, as it will take off the bluing you worked so hard to put on."

Know proper firearm safety.,Store your gun in a safe manner away from children's reach

",How to Become a Gun Expert," There are a few things that you must ALWAYS remember when dealing with guns. These rules are very basic, but CRITICAL and cannot be stressed enough. Without these, you will get hurt ... it is just a matter of when not if. Guns are NOT toys; there is no room for tom-foolery or games with them. They are tools made to do one thing. Remember that and you will do well. If you are unable or unwilling to always abide by these simple rules, then you certainly should stay away from guns and save yourself a lifetime (possibly a short one) of grief. With that said, here are rules to live by (literally).


""Unloaded"" guns kill: How? Consider, ""All guns are always loaded."" Meaning, removing the ammo magazine does not unload the chambered cartridge. Never assume a gun is safe until you have personally checked the firing chamber for the last cartridge, and verified it is unloaded, as well.






Always keep your finger off of the trigger until you are ready to shoot






Never point your gun at anything you are not willing to destroy ... always keep your gun pointed in a safe direction.






When shooting, always know your target and what is beyond it.

",How to Apply for a Lifetime License to Carry a Handgun in Indiana," You are not eligible if you have been convicted of a felony, have had a previous handgun license suspended, are under 18 years old (under 23 years old if a delinquent as a child), have been arrested for a class A or B felony, arrested for any felony involving violence or the use of a deadly weapon.;
, Indiana collects two fee's during the application process. The first fee goes to the State's general fund, and the second goes to the local department's fund for firearms and firearm training. The basic process to obtain a permit is: complete the application, provide fingerprints, pay the State fee, pay the Local fee at your local law enforcement agency, and then wait to receive your permit.

, The online application is located at https://firearms.ariesportal.com/. If you prefer not to use the online form, you can contact your local law enforcement agency to determine how to submit the application. If you live outside of an incorporated town or city, you can contact the sheriff's office of the county you live in.

, This varies depending on where you're applying. Most police departments have specific days of the week and operating hours for handling applications. If you use the online application process, you can continue through to L-1 Enrollment site to schedule a time to be fingerprinted and pay the State license fee.

, Purchase a cashier's check or money order for $75 ($60 if you have a current license) made payable to: State of Indiana. If you plan on going to an L-1 Enrollment center for the state processing, they charge an additional fee of $9.95. That fee gets added to the state fee and they send in the state fee for you. So, if you are getting a new license at an L-1 Enrollment center, you will bring one payment for $84.95. If you choose to pay by money order, L-1 Enrollment requires money orders be made out to: L-1 Enrollment.

, Purchase another cashier's check or money order for $50 ($40 if you have a current license) made payable to your local police department or sheriff's office. In some cases, the local payment can be made with a personal check or in cash.

, At this point you should know where you're going and when. You should also have your fee payments ready to go. Be sure to bring your driver's license or other form of State recognized photo ID.

, Use the online application, or go to your designated place of application and fill out the official application. It will ask for your name, full address, length of residence in the community, whether your residence is located within the limits of any city or town, your occupation, place of business or employment, criminal record (if any) and convictions (minor traffic offenses excepted), age, race, sex, nationality, date of birth, citizenship, height, weight, build, color of hair, color of eyes, scars and marks, whether you have previously held an Indiana license to carry (serial number and year issued, if so) whether your license has ever been suspended (year and reason, if so) and your reason for desiring a license.

, You'll need to be finger printed. If you use the ink process, they usually have a place for you to wash your hands but it's somewhat difficult to get all the ink off. If you use the INKless process, your fingerprints are scanned electronically. There is no mess with the INKless process and it is faster to receive your permit.

, If you filled out your application on line, your local law enforcement agency will have electronic access to it. They will complete more of the form when you go in for fingerprinting. They run the criminal background check and enter your prints into the database (if you didn't do the INKless). This can take a couple of days. You then need to return to pick up your permit application and local approval (background check) to be mailed (along with the $75 money order) to the state.

, If you use the online application and the inkless fingerprinting process, it takes about 2 weeks from the time you have everything submitted and paid to receive your permit. If you submit the application manually and use inked fingerprinting, it usually takes 4-8 weeks to process an application. With the increased demand due to the new lifetime licenses your request might take 12-14 weeks. If you are renewing a license they will staple your old license to your application (pink copy). If you keep them stapled and carry both then you may continue carrying a handgun until you receive your new license or your application is rejected.

, Eventually your license will arrive in the mail and you'll finally have your lifetime license! Or, your application will be rejected and a portion of your application fee will be refunded.

, Take your new card and get it laminated to protect it. (Notice that it has a place to sign it before you laminate it.)

, If you change your name, address or are convicted of something that might change your eligibility you must notify the superintendent, in writing, within 30 days. You can (but are not required to) purchase a new license after an address change for a fee of $20

Submit the proper forms and wait.",How to Apply for a Concealed Carry Permit," Obtaining a permit to carry a concealed weapon varies from state-to-state. However, there are a few basic requirements you must meet regardless of where you live. First, you must be at least 21 years of age. Then you must have “proof of good character.” This means you haven’t been convicted of any felonies like DUIs or assault and battery., Outside of the basic requirements, each state will require proof of residency. For example, in Ohio you have to have been a resident of the state for at least 45 days, and a resident of your home county for 30 days. You will also have to meet each state’s requirements for training and application.Pay strict attention to the requirements as some jurisdictions may deny your application for the slightest infraction.
You may also want to talk to people who already have a permit about their experience and where you should start.

, If you meet the basic requirements for a concealed carry permit in your state, then you can apply for a permit. However, there are differences in the application approval process.Shall Issue. Most states have “Shall Issue” policies, meaning that they will give a permit to you if you meet all of the requirements.

May Issue. A handful of states have “May Issue” policies, meaning that they may deny a permit application even if you meet all of the requirements. These judgments are made on a case-by-case basis. States with a “May Issue” policy include California, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Delaware, Virgin Islands, Maryland, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and New York.

Right Denied. There are couple of places in the U.S. where concealed carry is not allowed. These include American Samoa and N. Mariana Islands.

, You can do this by sending your fingerprints to the Bureau of Criminal Identification or BCI. To get fingerprinted, simply contact your local law enforcement and set up an appointment. They should be able to provide you with a fingerprinting card, but you can also print them off online. The process should only take about 10-15 minutes. Once you’ve finished, the department should be able to send your prints off to be checked. In total it should cost around $50-$60., Make sure to learn about your state’s application process to ensure that you can complete every step. The application process for a concealed carry permit may vary from state to state, so be sure to check the requirements in your state.

For example, in Louisiana, you need to complete an application, prove that you meet all of the requirements, agree to comply with the rules and regulations for concealed carry, and pay the $25.00 application fee., Most states require you to take a gun safety class. This is recommended even if you do not plan to carry a weapon. Most training courses are around 8 hours and are taught by a qualified CCW instructor. You can find one through your state’s CCW website or through your local sheriff’s department.


If you are already certified, you may be able to bypass training. However, if your certification is older than 3 years, you may have to take another class.If you are an active or reserve member of the military, you may also be able to skip training.

, Each state will have a specific application for you to fill out. With your application you will also have to include a photocopy of your driver’s license and a color photograph of passport quality. You should also have your cleared background check, fingerprints, and firearm certification.Keep in mind that every state may require additional or different items like proof of residency.
The fee for obtaining a license may also vary from state to state, but expect to pay between $30-$50.

, It can take anywhere between 30-60 days to obtain your permit. In the meantime, do not carry a concealed weapon if it is illegal to do so without a permit in your area. Some shall issue states allow you to open-carry a weapon, but you should check your state's official website for more information before doing anything else.Once you have your permit it should be good for 5 years.

Regulate your breathing.,
Master the prone position.,
Follow through when you pull the trigger.,
Use a sling when you're shooting.",How to Become a Better Shooter1," When you breathe, your body and gun move up and down and affect where your shot lands. To minimize these effects, use your natural respiratory pause to steady yourself when you fire your shot.Do this by inhaling and exhaling, then holding your breath while you pull the trigger. The less forced it feels, the more natural shooting your rifle will feel.


Don't hold your breath for too long or your sight picture may begin to blur. The sight picture is what you see when looking through your guns front and rear sights.When firing multiple shots in quick succession, take shorter breaths so you can utilize your natural respiratory pause every time you fire the gun.
During the pause your respiratory muscles are more relaxed which makes it easy to stay on target.;
, The prone position is when the shooter is laying on his stomach while aiming his shot. This position is the most natural and accurate shooting position to learn if you're firing a rifle.Other stances are not as effective. This includes firing while you are standing, which is the hardest way to shoot a rifle and is inaccurate across long distances.If you are trying to improve your long range accuracy, master shooting in the prone position before moving on to harder shooting positions.


Other positions including sitting or kneeling.
Do not stand up with your rifle. Put the gun on the ground, stand up, then pick it up while you are standing.

, Follow through entails keeping your gun still while the bullet exits the barrel. To improve your follow through, keep your eye on the target for the entire duration of the shot. Don't move your head after you pull the trigger, and keep the pressure on the trigger even after you've fired.Allowing your finger to bounce forward can affect the gun's natural point of aim.
Do not keep the trigger pulled if you are using a fully automatic rifle.
By developing good follow through, you'll be able to spot where your shots landed, and how to adjust your aim for the next shot., Shooting slings can help you keep your gun close to your shoulder and in the right position, especially if you don't have a bipod to keep your rifle steady. Shooting slings can act as carrying straps, but double as gun to shoulder support. To alter your sling to act as a shooting sling, detach the sling from the rear of the rifle, and create a loop at the end of the sling. This loop will anchor to your supporting arm and help you steady your aim.This will help keep your rifle steady as you take your shot.

"
"
Hold the gun firmly with the proper grip.,
Use the correct stance.,
Develop better trigger control.,
Verify that you have proper sight alignment.",How to Become a Better Shooter2," For the proper grip, your dominant hand should rest high on the backstrap of the gun. Your other hand should cover the bottom portion of the gun in the space that your dominant hand is not covering and your thumb on your strong hand should be right over your non-dominant thumb. Both thumbs should be pointing towards your target. Rest your trigger finger on the side of the trigger guard until you are ready to shoot.Do not hold the top of the gun or the slide lock as it can cause serious injuries to your hands.
Holding your gun with the correct grip will help you minimize the effects of recoil., Stand with your dominant foot behind your non-dominant foot, a hip length apart from one another. Bend your torso forward slightly, and balance on the balls of your feet to counteract the kickback that's generated from the pistol.Do not bend backward. Your shoulders should be in front of your hips.

, The pad of your index finger should be in the direct center of the trigger of the gun. When firing, steadily press your finger in a rearward motion. There should be a level of slack on the trigger before you reach resistance. Once your shot is fired, allow the trigger to move forward again and reset before taking your next shot.The pressure should come from your trigger finger only. Do not pull the trigger by tightening the grip on your hand., The front and back of your sights should align on the top, and vertically. When aligned correctly, there should be equal distance between the front sight and either side of the rear sights. Proper sight alignment is necessary for your shots to be accurate.If your close range shots are accurate but at long range veer to one side, there's a good chance you'll need to readjust your sight alignment.

"
Practice dry firing your gun.,
Practice regularly.,
Keep safe at all times.,
Get an instructor at a range to help you.,
Master your natural point of aim.",How to Become a Better Shooter3," Dry firing your gun is a good practice technique that saves money on purchasing training ammunition. Before practicing with dry ammunition, make sure you pick a safe location and double check that your gun is unloaded. Practice aiming and firing into a spot on the wall. Take into account your grip and your stance. Standing in a mirror may help you.


Dry firing is also beneficial because it takes away other distractions like the sound of your gun or the recoil that occurs when firing live rounds.
You can also use dummy rounds when dry firing, which are plastic rounds that allow the gun's slide to move forward., Like many other skills, repeating the action of firing your gun will help you build muscle memory and will make shooting your gun feel more instinctual than procedural.Go to the range as often as you can and practice dry firing on your off time or if you don't have the money for live ammunition.


Having muscle memory will also help you in self-defense or live fire situations.

, Keeping safe means keeping your gun unloaded and finger off the trigger until you're ready to fire it. Check that there are no bullets in the magazine or the chamber. Never point your gun towards something that you don't want to shoot. When your gun is idle, make sure that it's pointed down range. Wear protective headphones and eyewear as well.


All ranges have different rules. Ask a staff person for a copy of the rules.Remove the magazine from the gun until you're ready to fire.
If you're using a revolver, make sure that the cylinder is bullet free.
Never go past the firing line unless a staff member ceases all fire on the range.

, An instructor will be able to assist you with your form. If you're not sure why your shots are missing your target, ask them to evaluate your shooting and they can help you adjust. Always listen to the instructor and pay close attention to the steps that they provide.


Look online for firing ranges in your area.
Ask the front desk at the range for an instructor who can help you improve.

, The natural point of aim is the natural position of the gun and your body, while you are behind it. To find your natural point of aim, center yourself on a target that you want to shoot. Draw your gun, and set the gun sights on the center of the target. Close your eyes and swing your gun 45 degrees back and forth by rotating your hips three times. Come back to the center of the target and open your eyes. This is your natural point of aim. If you are left or right of your target, make sure to adjust your feet so that you are centered on the target.The tip of the front sight post will designate the natural point of aim.Always make sure that your gun is unloaded when testing your natural point of aim.

Get back on the lift and ride through the trees again!",How to Ride Through Trees on a Snowboard2,"


Consult the map of the mountain usually found at the resort. The map will have a symbol for areas dense with trees. These areas are generally found in between designated runs or in the ""backside"" of certain mountains.
Or just look for areas while riding the mountain.

,


Choose the entrance based on how well it will set you up for a good run through trees.
Try to enter as far up the mountain as possible as this will offer you more opportunity to alter your path.

, It is important that you be aware that there will be many more obstacles than on a groomed run.


Bend your knees more than usual and be on the lookout for rocks, branches, holes, and of course trees. Bending your knees will help you to absorb the impacts of rough terrain as well as be in a better position to make a quick turn.

, Look for spaces wide enough to fit your board turned horizontally as you may need to stop suddenly if there is an unseen obstacle.


Try to look a few trees ahead to determine if your turn will set you up well for the following turn.
Be on the look-out for areas in the trees that you want to ride through on the next run.

, Riding through trees requires you to be much more alert than you need to be on groomed runs.


Do not focus on the trees, but on the spaces between them. Focusing too much on the trees will cause you to unknowingly steer toward them.

, Tree runs are not patrolled and many times cliffs are not marked. You will be riding at your own risk.


If you see a sharp drop-off up ahead, slow down and examine the area.
Occasionally a sharp drop-off will simply mean a change in slope, but it is not worth the risk to continue full speed.

Do not go searching on your own for frozen water to skate on. This is not safe. Stick to lakes and ponds that are monitored and maintained to be ice skating rinks.

, People of all ages enjoy tubing. Typically, tickets are purchased and you’re given an allotment of time to enjoy the tubing lanes. You can ride down the slope on an individual inner tube, or you can have your family’s tubes linked up and go down the slope together. Some of the steeper slopes offer lift services up to the top, while gentler slopes are manually accessed by an uphill walking trail.


If you have very small children, make sure you check the rules for any height restrictions before heading to the tubing lanes."

Play in the snow together.,
Go for a walk or hike.,
Plan a camping trip.,
Go ice fishing.",How to Plan Fun Winter Activities for Your Family2," If you live in an area that gets snowfall, head outdoors to enjoy it. You could build a snowman together or have a snowball fight. If you have small children, teach them how to make snow angels. Slightly older children might enjoy building a snow fort. Make sure everyone bundles up appropriately for the freezing temperatures.


Check your local weather service before heading out to make sure it is a safe day for playing in the snow.

, If you live in a snowy climate, head out with your family to enjoy the snowy scenery. Look into local opportunities for snowshoeing.If your area doesn't get snowfall, you can still enjoy the winter scenery. Check out one of your local parks, which typically feature a number of trails that can be explored. You can also visit your closest national park, which may offer more interesting terrain. If you're staying at a resort, they often offer guided hiking and snowshoeing on their trails.Be sure your family dresses in warm layers and wears snow boots. Bring some snacks with you for an energy boost while you’re out on the trail.
If you are serious hikers, try one of the many trail-finding apps such as AllTrails or Chimani. These apps can help you find safe and well-maintained hiking trails that you may not know about., Many families enjoy camping outdoors in the winter months. Look into local camping sites and find out if any national or state parks near you remain open for winter campers. Do a little research before you go camping and be sure that you are equipped with temperature-appropriate clothing, sleeping bags and tents. Winter camping can be dangerous if you aren’t knowledgeable and prepared.Learn about the terrain before you camp. Obtain a map and provide every member of your family with one. Make sure no one heads out to explore alone.
Consult the local weather forecast before you head to your camp. Avoid camping when snowstorms or other extreme winter weather is expected.

, If you are near a frozen lake or pond, plan a day of ice fishing for your family. You’ll need to bring the right equipment with you, including tools to chisel through the ice to get to the water. If you’ve never done it before, you may want to look into hiring a guide. Every member of your family will most likely need to obtain a fishing license, so look into the local regulations before you head out.Bundle up appropriately, since you’ll be out on the ice for hours at a time. Wear snow boots. Pack a thermos of hot chocolate or some other warm drink for each family member to enjoy.
Don’t forget sunblock. Ice and snow are very reflective, which can cause sunburn.

Look into winter light festivals near you.,
Seek out seasonal holiday events.,
Find out about winter markets and bazaars in your area.,
Take in seasonal plays, movies, celebrations and other performances.",How to Plan Fun Winter Activities for Your Family3," Many places all over the world hold light festivals during the winter months. These festivals feature light displays of all kinds, including art installations, stringed lights and lantern displays, to name a few. These festivals are open to the public and are often held in parks, but the locations can vary wildly. Find out what opportunities you have near you and take in the beautiful illuminated displays with your family.Typically, you will need to pay a fee to attend a light festival, so make sure you’re prepared for that before arriving with your family.

, If you have small children, look into local events that will allow them to celebrate the holidays. These events often provide a wide range of activities, like craft-making, giveaways, caroling and the chance to make/decorate gingerbread houses. Unique and elaborate light displays are often part of these events, as well.Find out if professional photography is an option and get a photo of your child with holiday figures or standing beneath a towering light display.
You may want to arrive to these sorts of events early, since they tend to get crowded fast.

, There are probably several different events like this during the winter season that your family can enjoy together. At these events, vendors set up and sell unique gifts, home décor, clothing, accessories, holiday décor, food, jewelry, stationary and a lot more. Sometimes they are hosted by the city and held in convention centers, but they may also take place at malls and shopping centers near you.Look into your local options and explore the wares and displays together.

, Many areas will put on holiday plays featuring a local theater troupe, or offer some other type of theatrical entertainment that your family can enjoy. Musical performances are often held, as well, ranging from orchestras to sing-a-longs.Check the local movie theaters for special showings of classic holiday films like “It’s a Beautiful Life” and “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.”


Large fireworks displays are often planned in the winter months, especially around New Years’ Eve, so check out what’s available near you.

Exercise outdoors.,
Go for walks.,
Take your dog to the park.,
Take care of outdoor chores.",How to Spend More Time Outside During Winter1," Although cold weather may push some of your workouts indoors, you can still exercise outdoors during much of the winter. For example, with the appropriate clothing, you can continue running outside during the coldest months of the year.With the appropriate gear and an eye on the weather, a winter wonderland can be a great place for exercising.


With warm clothing, you can also bicycle in the winter months. However, you need to watch for ice on roads and trails. It may be a good idea to walk a path before you bike on it to make sure that it is free of ice.
Be on the lookout for ice that can lead to an accident and injury.;
, The winter months are a great time to go for walks. If you live somewhere that receives snowfall, winter walks can offer scenic beauty. Moreover, the fresh winter air can be refreshing and rejuvenating.With a warm coat, a thick cap, and a good pair of boots, you can continue to take long walks in the wintertime.


Make sure that you dress appropriately and listen to the local weather. If it is dangerously cold outside or there is severe winter weather, stay inside.
Depending on where you live and your local weather, you may be able to go hiking in the winter months. However, many state and national parks are closed in the winter. Also, inclement weather may make some trails unsafe or inaccessible. Be sure to check with local parks officials before hiking.
If you want to go for walks off the beaten path, you might consider snowshoeing. This will allow you to go for longer hikes on surfaces that have not been shoveled or cleared of snow.

, If you own a dog, visiting your local park is a great opportunity to get outside during the winter. You can walk your dog or play games like fetch. Plus, having a playful romp with your dog outside will keep both of you warm, too! If you bundle up properly, you and your dog can both enjoy the great outdoors during the winter.


Most dogs’ coats offer them natural protection against the cold. However, if your dog has a light coat, you can buy your pet a winter vest and boots to keep them warm.If the weather is extremely cold, limit your dog’s time outside.

, The winter months offer a number of unique outdoor chores that you may need to accomplish. In the late fall or early winter, you will likely need to get out and rake up the leaves that have fallen in your yard. If you live somewhere that gets lots of snow, you may need to get outside and shovel the snow on your driveway and sidewalk."

Try winter camping.,
Learn to ski or snowboard.,
Try ice fishing.,
Go ice skating.,
Play in the snow.",How to Spend More Time Outside During Winter2," Although a number of state and national parks are closed to campers during the winter months, in many places you can still camp in the winter months. In order to winter camp, you will need to get tents, sleeping bags, and clothing that are intended for winter temperatures. You should also pack stove equipment because good firewood is often hard to find in the winter.Check with your local outdoor outfitter and the local parks service before you do any winter camping. You should also check the weather and local conditions before you start your excursion.

, A common way that many people spend extra time outdoors in the winter is by either skiing or snowboarding. These activities will help you spend hours outdoors in the fresh winter air. However, in order to properly slide down the slopes, you will need to get the appropriate winter gear to keep your warm and safe.You can also cross-country if you have enough snow and flat enough terrain.
Both sports are also rather expensive. Between the ski passes and the gear, you may end up paying a significant amount of money. Be sure to talk to a sales associate at your local sporting goods store to find the appropriate gear at a good price.

, In certain locations, the winter months offer a unique opportunity to go fishing. This is a great opportunity to get outside and spend some time with others. Once you acquire a fishing license and the appropriate gear, you will be ready to get outside and catch some delicious fish.Before you go, check with the local game and parks department to make sure the ice is thick enough for fishing. It is important that you know when ice is safe.

, Once ponds and lakes are covered with a significant layer of ice, ice skating is a common outdoor winter activity in many locations. With a pair of ice skates, you can glide along the surface of the ice. Besides lakes and ponds, there are also outdoor ice rinks, which are great locations to play hockey or figure skate.


Always check the thickness of the ice before you go out on it. Never skate if you do not know the thickness of the ice.

, If you live somewhere that gets a significant amount of snow, the winter offers some unique opportunities for outdoor play. You can slide down a snow-covered hill on a sled or tube. You can build a snow fort or have a snowball fight. You can also make a snowman or create some snow angels. If you get snow, get outside and take advantage of the fun opportunity.Before you go play in the snow, make sure that you are wearing appropriate winter clothing. You should also check the weather to make sure that it is safe to play outside.

Find the right head covering.,
Get good gloves.,
Purchase a warm coat.,
Buy a warm pair of boots.,
Look for a good pair of socks.,
Consider other important gear.",How to Spend More Time Outside During Winter3," The ideal winter hat will keep your head warm while you are outdoors but, depending on the activity, prevent it from getting too hot. For most activities, a simple wool cap that covers your ears should suffice. If you are doing more strenuous activities, you might consider a winter headband that allows heat to escape from the top of your head while keeping your ears warm.Ear muffs are also a great choice if you want to keep your ears warm but prevent the rest of your head from overheating.
If you want to keep your neck and face warm, you should consider a scarf. You can wrap it around your neck and pull it over your face if it gets too cold.
Ultimately, you might want a number of winter caps. You might want to consider a thick cap for walking around in the snow and a light cap for running, snowshoeing, or doing other high-energy activities.

, Protecting your hands is essential to enjoying the outdoors during winter. Proper gloves will keep you from getting too cold or developing frostbite. If you are walking around or ice skating, you may want a thicker glove made from wool. For playing in the snow, skiing, or snowshoeing, you will want a thicker glove that is also waterproof. Depending on the activity, you may also want a glove that affords you some dexterity to use your phone or manipulate things with your fingers.Ultimately, you may want to have different gloves depending on the activity., A warm winter coat is essential to enjoying the outdoors during winter. In general, you will want a thick insulated coat.However, if you are going to be more active, you may opt for lighter clothing that helps you stay warm but keeps you from overheating.In addition, layering can also help you stay warm by creating pockets of warm air and preventing moisture from seeping in.Consider investing in at least two winter coats, a heavier one for general use and a lighter coat for any strenuous outdoor activities.
A down-filled puffer coat is great for staying warm. However, it is not a great option if you are going to be doing anything active because you can easily get overheated. Also, down absorbs moisture and loses much of its warmth if exposed to humidity.If you are going to be active outdoors, you might want to consider a ski coat that offers water-resistance and helps keep you cool.

, Depending on the activity, there are a number of things to consider when looking for a good winter boot. Generally, you want a boot that is insulated and waterproof. If your feet get wet and cold, you will quickly cool down and you run the risk of hypothermia. If you are doing any snowshoeing or playing in the snow, you might want to consider a waterproof boot that gives you a little more flexibility.Finally, skiing, snowboarding, and skating all have their own footwear with special considerations.


Be sure to talk with a sales representative when you buy any boots for skiing or snowboarding. They will help you get the appropriate boots.

, A good pair of socks helps keep your feet warm and dry. For brief excursions outdoors, wear a thicker sock that traps more warm air and keeps your foot insulated. If you are going to spend an extended period outdoors, you should wear two to three layers of socks to keep your feet warm and dry.When layering socks, you might want to start with a lightweight wicking sock, covered by a lightweight wool sock, with a medium wool sock on top. This combination will keep your feet warm while wicking away moisture.

, Depending on the activity, you will need to consider other pieces of equipment or clothing. If you are skiing or snowboarding, you will need to find skis or a snowboard that are the right size. You will also need goggles to protect your eyes from ice and glare and a sturdy helmet to protect your head. If you are on the ice, you may want ice grabbers to attach to the bottoms of your boots. Make sure that you know what equipment you will need to perform the specific outdoor activity.


A sales associate at a local sporting goods or outdoor store should be able to help you find the gear that will work best for your outdoor adventures.

Strap on your snowshoes.,
Walk with a wide stance.,
Lift the nose of the snowshoe up if you need to clear the snow.,
Use poles to help yourself along (optional).,
Kick into the snow with your toes if you're going uphill.,
Know your snowshoes before going downhill.,
Dig the side of your snowshoe into slopes while walking along them.",How to Snowshoe1," Put your boots on first, then fasten the snowshoes over them one at a time. Position your foot so the ball of your foot is located over the pivot point. Check the entire length of the snowshoe for straps, making sure to tighten each one firmly.;
, You will probably have to widen your stance a bit to accommodate for the width of the each snowshoe, which may give your hips more of a workout than you are used to.Walk at your normal pace, leading with your heel and rolling over the ball, then the toe.

, If the snow is fresh and powdery, rather than packed down, lift the nose of the snowshoe above the level of the snow with each step.Do not lift your legs higher than you need to, as fully removing the snowshoe from the snow can be tiring.

, One or two poles can be used to help you maintain your balance and provide additional power, along with an upper body workout. They are especially helpful if you go snowshoeing in deep snow, but some snowshoers who stick to prepared trails don't bother using them.


It does not matter whether you use ski poles or snowshoe poles, as long as they are a comfortable length for you to use.

, This will dig your snowshoe into it, giving you more leverage to climb. If your kicking creates a deep hole rather than a firm step, find a different way up the slope.Many snowshoes have a ""heel lift"" which can be flipped up between your boot heel and the snowshoe. This provides a more stable support for your legs during steep ascents.

, Some snowshoes have heel crampons, which dig back into the snow as you lean backward. If you only have crampons or cleats further forward, however, you should keep your weight directly above your feet, so the support digs into the snow as you descend.


Try not to swing your legs in long arcs when descending. If you lose your balance, sit down rather than run down the slope., When traversing a slope at the same elevation, rather than traveling up or down, hit the side of the snowshoe into the slope for more support with each step. Lean in the uphill direction to keep yourself balanced.Poles may make traversing much easier.

"
"
Use an appropriate snowshoe.,
Travel with friends.,
Dress in layers.,
Don't walk over ski tracks.,
Take turns breaking the trail.,
Bring snacks and water.,
Stay safe.",How to Snowshoe2," Some snowshoes are designed to allow running, but most are awkward to move in above a walking pace. If you will be walking on steep terrain, purchase a well-fitting snowshoe with plenty of traction at the toe and heel. You may need a snowshoe with a larger support if the snow is especially loose or powdery.


More detailed information is included in the section on selecting a snowshoe.

, It's safer to travel with other people on long hikes, even if you are familiar with the area. Let someone who is staying behind know where you are going, so you can be found more quickly if an accident occurs.

, Minimize the chance of frostbite or overheating by dressing in several layers of clothing, which can be removed or added as necessary. Begin with a snug layer of thermal long underwear, then put on at least two layers of clothing over both your torso and legs. The outermost layer should be waterproof.


Bring a spare layer as well in case your clothing gets wet.
Avoid cotton, especially next to your skin, as it takes a long time to dry. Synthetic materials and wool do a better job drawing moisture away from your skin, which keeps you warmer., It's good etiquette to stay out of the way of established ski tracks, since snowshoes can ruin them. It's fine to walk alongside these tracks, as long as you move out of the way when cross country skiers go by.

, If you are not on an established trail, walk in a single file line, allowing the person at the front to set the pace by stepping on the untouched snow. Breaking a trail this way is much more tiring than normal walking, so switch places to share the effort among all the participants., Snowshoeing can be more exhausting than it appears, so bring along high-energy snacks or meals to keep yourself going. Hydration is just as important during winter sports as during the summer, even though you may not feel as thirsty in the cold., Always check the weather forecast before you leave, and search for information on avalanche danger zones nearby. Useful equipment for longer hikes includes a GPS unit, a compass, a beacon, and a portable shovel.

"
"
Choose a snowshoe suited for your activity.,
Weigh yourself while carrying gear.,
Select the correct size of snowshoe.,
Choose between snowshoe sizes based on the snow type.,
Find a snowshoe with a comfortable binding.,
Learn about snowshoe materials.",How to Snowshoe3," There are several main varieties of snowshoe, with designs and traction suited for different activities. Think about how you plan to use your snowshoe, and look for an appropriate design:Recreational, trekking , or flat terrain snowshoes are designed for relatively flat terrain and prepared trails. They have some traction, but not much.

Hiking or rugged terrain snowshoes are a step up in durability and traction, good for occasional off-trail hikes but not lengthy or excessively steep off-trail expeditions.

Backcountry, climbing, or mountaineering snowshoes are good for camping trips and lengthy off-trail expeditions. Make sure the shoes have significant traction at both front and back if you plan on climbing steep slopes.

Racing, running, or aerobic snowshoes are for running over tightly packed snow trails, and are too light weight to use off trail.

, The more weight you carry, the longer and wider your snowshoe needs to be to support you. Weigh yourself while you are dressed in your winter outfit and carrying your typical pack of gear.

, If the snowshoes have a labeled weight limit, use them to narrow down your options. Otherwise, use these general rules of thumb for the most common snowshoe sizes:Snowshoes sized 8 x 25 inches (20 x 64 cm) are usually suitable for weights between 120 and 180 pounds (54–82 kg).
Snowshoes sized 9 x 30 inches (23 x 76 cm) can support weights between 160 and 220 pounds (73–100 kg).
Snowshoes sized 10 x 36 inches (25 x 91 cm) are designed for weights above 200 pounds (91 kg).

, You may find two or three sizes of snowshoe that are appropriate for your weight. If you often travel through deep, powdery snow, go with a larger size for more support. If you prefer to stick to flattened trails or hard packed snow, select the smaller size for greater maneuverability.

, The binding that attaches the snowshoe to your boot should be a tight fit to keep you comfortable and steady during a hike. Besides the size of the shoe, there are two main factors that affect the binding:



Fixed bindings stay under your foot as you step, allowing for a comfortable stride and an easier time stepping over obstacles. Pivoted bindings fall away from your foot as you step, which keeps your legs relatively free of snow and may make climbing easier.Snowshoes are usually labeled men's, women's, or youth, which may describe a different shape as well as a size. Try on snowshoes in multiple categories if you are having trouble finding a comfortable one.

, You won't usually get to choose the exact materials your snowshoe is built from, as the manufacturer selects materials it considers suitable for the snowshoe's intended purpose. However, if you're interested in deciphering product information, here are some tips to help you:


Most modern frames are lightweight aluminum; if ""powder-coated"", it will pick up less snow but may suffer from unattractive paint chipping. Wooden frames are more traditional, but also more likely to break.An especially lightweight snowshoe for on-trail use might not have any frame.The ""decking"" material around the frame gives your snowshoe ""flotation,"" or lift above the snow. This is typically a synthetic material, such as the flexible hypalon or the rigid composite plastic decking.Ask the manufacturer if you want to find out more about a specific material's characteristics.

Snowshoes can be built or acquired in the following ways ordered by quality of the shoe.",How to Make Snowshoes and Use Them,"

Aluminum/High Quality: Aluminum snowshoes can be purchased in a number of different places and have evolved to their current state of high adaptability and light weight.



 


Ash/High quality: Ash is a very light, mold resistant wood used as base so as to weave rawhide or basswood into a central lattice which then holds ones foot. This type of snowshoe is probably the most expensive but also the most effective.





By quartering an ash log one can, by use of water bend an ash quarter around itself to be used as primitive base for weaving.
Rawhide or cured basswood can be used as reinforcement and footholds.


Spruce/Low Quality: The easiest snowshoe to make and also the most adaptable. However they are made for one time use and are rather flimsy for long expeditions.





Repeat all of the steps bellow for two shoes. Also note that when asked to reinforce a knot or string, do so generously as your whole body will be placed on top of it.
Find two small spruce trees that are four feet tall.






Pull the spruce trees out by their roots.






Cut off all the limbs and put them to the side.






Pull the many spruce roots up until you have several to use as central lashing.






Bend the length of the spruce tree around and tie the top and bottom together with spruce root so as to form the shape of a tear (make sure your knot will hold, it may help to double up on the reinforcement for this knot).






Observe the widest part of the shoe, opposite the tied end. From the centerline of your snowshoe observe the widest distance in your loop away from this centerline. Connect these two points using spruce root.






It is now important to reinforce this line as it will be the anchor for your foot.






Tie more spruce root to the end in which your previous root is tied. Now keep looping root in a counterclockwise fashion around the main root. Your center line should ideally be taut, and be at least a quarter inch in thickness. Secure the other end of these wrapped loops on the other side of the snowshoe






Now it is important to reinforce your knots to either side of this line to make sure they do not come loose and slide down the two sides of your shoe. Using a stick gather spruce sap to cover these knots. Also fir sap works excellently and can be acquired by popping bubbles on the outside bark of the tree.






After sap is applied split several spruce roots in half lengthwise and wrap them around these wet knots.






Observe that the back of the shoe is pointing towards you. The end directly opposite this point will be the next area to work on.






To work on this point take your longest root and wrap it around one of your reinforced knots. When it is firmly anchored, string it up to the point directly opposite the back of your snowshoe.






Anchor the root there with an untightened knot. (The reason it shouldn't be completely tight is because you will have to run another root under the knot you have just made.)






Do the same with the other side.






Observe that you have two knots that are loosely touching at the top of your shoe. Slip a root under both loops and tie them together in a knot. Then use the extra length to go over and under these two loops, just like when you reinforced the central shoestring. When you feel proper reinforcement has been applied cover this larger knot with spruce or fir sap to seal the deal. If you have done this right you can now see a noticeable triangle in your reinforcements.






From here your snowshoe should be taking shape. Observe the large gap between the side pointing towards you and the central string running horizontally. This large gap will be the next area to work on.






Observe the end pointed towards you, and the spruce roots used to hold this end together. Tie two spruce roots around the larger wrap of roots. If you have done this correctly your two roots should go between the two tied ends of your snowshoe snugging the roots that hold the two ends together.






Now run these two lines up to your central string. Anchor them to this string around 5 inches (12.7 cm) apart from one another.






If you have done this correctly the large gap you started with should now be split into three very long triangles that point towards the end of your snowshoe.






Now it is time to finish the job, take three long spruce roots and tie them on one side of the shoe bellow your central line. Space them apart equally down the length of your shoe.






String them across to the other side, making sure to loop them around each vertical spruce upright. After the roots are looped around each upright secure them on the other side just as you did your central line. Cover all your knots with sap and make sure to do so heavily to the back of your shoe.






Now weave in all the spruce boughs you cut off making sure to leave a gap for the front of your foot.






After The boughs are woven in you can now tie your boots into the shoe. Simply tie an extra root to the central string near an upright. Put the center of your boot on the central string between where the two uprights are tied. pull the root over your boot and anchor it tightly on the other upright.

, It is best to have a couple different kinds of swaps per troop, just in case another troop has similar swaps or another troop gets tired of the same swaps over and over. In addition to the fishhook idea, for example, your troop may also want to make jellyfish out of coffee filters or starfish out of construction paper.

, Since you will be making 20+ swaps per girl, you don't want to spend tons of money on materials. Swaps are supposed to be little handmade trinkets, not professional-quality souvenirs. It's okay if your swaps are made of less-than-perfect materials or look like they were made by children, which they were.

, Get the troop together and put the swaps together. Most swaps consist of a cute trinket and a safety pin, and you should also make sure that the event (ex. Aquarium Exploration), the month and year (ex. July 2011), your troop level and number (ex. Brownie troop 579), and your location (ex. Saint Louis, Missouri) is somewhere on the swap. If this information cannot be placed directly on the swap, such as in a case where it is made of pipecleaners, make small labels and stick the pin through them as well as the swap.

Reserve a spot in the meeting for the opening.,
Plan the rest of the meeting around the program work/badge.,
Make some time for fun!,
Get creative!,
Reserve a time at the end of the meeting for closing.",How to Plan a Girl Guide Meeting," It's always easier to write things down while planning a Girl Guide meeting, so that you don't forget important details. If you want, you could get together with another leader of your group (assuming that there is one) and share your ideas.;
, In your handbook, there's a list of program work and badges that the girls should cover during their 3 years as Girl Guides. Pick a part of the program work or the badge and do that in your meeting. Your meeting is going to center around this.

, Girl Guides have a special opening song that follows into a horseshoe formation. While the girls are in the horseshoe, explain to them what badge/program work you're going to do tonight.

, It's pretty easy to do once you've chosen what program work/badge you want to do. There are specific things that you need to do in order to earn the badge, and those things can be pretty time-consuming.

, At the beginning or at the end of your meeting, play some games such as ""The Blanket Game"", ""Streets and Alleys"", and/or ""Statues"".

, Plan a craft for the girls to do. If possible, have this craft relate to the badge you just earned. If you earned the reading badge, for example, make cool bookmarks!

, Girl Guides have a special closing song that they sing at the end of each meeting.

When cookies come in, order what the girls need for their customers, as well as plenty of extras for the booth sale.,
Have your troop create a poster (or posters) that tell the price of the cookies and include large, colorful pictures of the cookies.,
Educate your troop.,
Make sure that your girls can tell customers what their GOAL is.,
Train your girls in POLITE selling.,
If your troop plans to donate cookies to a cause, make a sign that indicates who you are donating to and that you are accepting cookie donations for this group.,
Make thank you notes.",How to Organize a Girl Scout Cookie Booth Sale1," If you know that nobody sold many Thin Mints this year, you may not want to buy as many so that you don't have tons of extra thin mints afterwards.;
, You can also include nutrition facts. You can also have the posters saying what your goal is and how many boxes you want to sell

, Make sure each girl knows which cookies contain nuts, chocolate, etc, and which cookies are healthier (usually, there is at least one type of cookie that is fat free or low fat). If possible, obtain samples of each cookie so that each girl can offer their opinions on a particular cookie if a customer asks.

, Customers will buy more cookies if girls can clearly describe what the profits will be going toward - ie. camp or a trip, etc.

, Nicely asking for support is not enough. ALWAYS say, ""Thank you anyway."" or ""Have a nice day.""

, Make sure your girls KNOW what this group is and why they chose it.

, They can be fancy, personal notes, or just pieces of paper that say ""Thanks"". These will go in the bag with the cookies for the customers. Make sure your troop writes lots of them!

"
"
This will depend on your council.,
Ask the scouts' parents if they have ""connections"".,
Call around.,
When you find a location, visit it and get an idea of where you can put your booth, where you'll keep your extra boxes/cookies, and what kind of bathroom and food facilities will be available.

,
Speak with the manager.",How to Organize a Girl Scout Cookie Booth Sale2," Find out if there is someone centrally arranging booths before you start calling around as this can lead to double-calling of businesses which is bad etiquette.

, If they work at a store like Kmart, Walmart, a local grocery store, or another place of the like, they may be able to get your troop a spot selling by the door.

, Place phone calls to local businesses that you might be able to sell in front of them. You might ask other leaders what stores they've had luck with in the past. Another tactic would be to find a store that isn't as big or common as the ones previously mentioned, but still gets a lot of customers, because the waiting list for these stores won't be as long.

,, Ask how long you can stay, if you can use furniture or tables (as opposed to bringing your own), and whatever other questions you may have.

Set up the table.,
Decorate and set the scene.,
Store the extra inventory.,
Get your cash box ready.,
Keep track of sales.,
Keep track of donations.",How to Organize a Girl Scout Cookie Booth Sale3," Set some of the cookies (maybe 4-5 boxes per cookie) on the table. (Customers often purchase in even numbers. Placing 5 boxes out ensures that you'll still have at least one box on display if the customer purchases up to four.) Organize the cookies on the table in rows or piles. You may want to put them in a specific order. Color order (Red to Purple - in the order of colors on a rainbow) and Cookie Sheet order (the order in which the cookies are listed on the order form) are the most common. You may also want to put the most popular cookies (Thin Mints and Samoas) to either end so customers must scan all the boxes looking for their favorites.

, Most Girl Scout offices sell posters, car window flags (that can also be attached to shopping carts or taped to walls), and other things of the like, and you may even be able to get cookie costumes - you or your girls can dress up as their favorite cookies and attract attention.

, Put the rest of the cookies behind or under the table where they can easily be reached. If you are at a grocery store, use a couple of carts/buggies to hold your cookies. Just keep them together so its easy to open up a new case. Store empty cartons and coats under the cart/buggy.

, Get out a pencil box, can, or other small container with a lid, a notebook, and a pen. The container will hold the money. Some leaders use a fanny pack or a bank money bag so the cash can be kept safe with them at all times.

, On an empty sheet in a notebook, write the names of all the cookies, with at least one line per type. Every time someone buys a box, make a tally mark next to the kind they bought to keep up with your sales. You might use a copy of a follow-on order form to track each booth sale. This isn't always necessary. You can use simple match with your booth tally sheet to determine total sales using inventory counts both before and after the sale.

, You may also want to write down what you get in donations, if any. Some people will give donations

When someone walks by, have a girl say something like ""Hello Sir (or Madam).,
Stand nearby as they examine the cookies and try to make up their mind.,
Put the cookies in a bag, along with a thank you note.",How to Organize a Girl Scout Cookie Booth Sale4," Would you like to buy some Girl Scout cookies from Troop (Insert troop number here)?"" If they say no or that they've already bought some, say ""Thanks anyway. Have a nice day."" If they say yes however, go on to the next step.

, Do not hover over them, but be ready in case they ask which cookies are the best or which are healthiest. Answer truthfully, and help them make their selection.

, Wait for the customer to hand you the money they owe you, then hand the cookies to them and say ""Thank you, and have a nice day.""

Take a few months to do this.,
For the first month, be proactive!,
Be wanted.,
Try to look nice.,
Work the clothing.,
Interact with them.,
Wait.,
Do not ditch your old friends.,
This advice really changed things for some people.

",How to Join the Popular Group," Remember it won't come in a week or two. Gradually do these things in order to become popular. Make a calendar and plan out your further actions of attempting to join the group.;
, Write down (or type, think of, etc) a list of things you want to improve. Whether it be shinier hair, better style, or a better dancer. Whatever it is, you have to set your mind to it.

, The popular group won't have any desire to be friends with you if they haven't already. Why? Because they don't know enough about you. So do things to get noticed, get on the An Honor roll, because when they look through it, seeing you're on it, well, it might impress them. Also, you could join a few teams and clubs. Yearbook Committee, Dance Line, and Tennis Team (or any other popular sports) would be great. Don't join something you're terrible at. That will only make them annoyed. Be committed to this and don't be a complainer!

, Looks are very important. For your hair, do something fun! Don't dye it any unnatural colors like purple or blue, but colors like chestnut, dark brown, honey blonde - all really cute colors. Make sure it's always neatly styled and pretty. It doesn't have to look model-like but shiny, beach waves are definitely going to attract some attention. For makeup, you must wear it. Try the bare minerals get started kit, it comes with great quality makeup. Also, make sure you have a brown eyeliner (preferably pencil), blush (peach for fair skin, pink for tan, and lilac-ish for olive skin) that is good quality such as Clinique or MAC, a good concealer (like Lancome, Clinique, etc) and definitely mascara. Eyeshadow isn't a must, but a plus. Before you try to do your makeup, go to a counter at the mall (Estee Lauder, Chanel. The better makeup quality the better they will teach you how to apply it) and get help on how to apply it all! If you want inspiration for a perfectly natural look, watch The Clique movie. All Pretty Committee members have really natural makeup. Always make an effort to look nice at school. Or anywhere where popular people will be.

, Clothes make a difference as well. Vineyard Vines, Abercrombie, Hollister, American Eagle, Aeropostale,H&M and even Juicy Couture and BCBG are popular amongst many popular crowds. Oh, and no FUGG boots. Buy the real thing. Have a trendy-but-classic style. Make it your own, though. Don't copy someone. Maintain great style.

, This is possibly the riskiest step. Target someone that is most likely nicest and friendliest. Don't try to be all buddy-buddy with the snobby rich girl. This is easy. Compliment them a few times a week, say hi in the halls, text them, and the next thing you know - they will ask to hang out with you, or if they don't, but you think you're at the right time, say 'hey, we should see that new movie on Saturday.' Be very careful. Do not bring up sensitive topics, complain, or share deep secrets. Save it for your diary.

, Once you have interacted with them, it's up to them whether they choose they want to be friends with you or not. Hoping they say yes, become friendly to everyone, even the queen bee (if there is one) but don't follow the queen bee. Try to be inspiring to the whole group. Don't let the queen bee intimidate you, she's a regular girl, just better at covering it up than most. However, don't be clingy or rude. Be polite and sweet, and laugh with them. Try to blend in with them, while inspiring them naturally. If you're funny, let it show. If you have great boy advice, share it! Don't make it like 'Oh My God. I know everything about guys,' But if someone says, 'I wish ____ would like me,' give them a flirting tip. Or if someone is sad, make a sarcastic joke that will cheer her up, if it's the appropriate time. Let natural talent shine. don't wait too long or hey will think you are weird.

, Assuming they aren't total freaks, help them join the new group, too. If you do not wish to be friends with them, don't hold on to it for their sake. It sounds mean, but friends drift apart. Text them less, sit with them at lunch once a week instead of three times, eventually, the desire will go away and you have your new friends.

Do some background research.,
Look at how long you are going to be there, and what facilities will be available.,
Decide on the activities you will participate in: watersports/activities, fishing, hiking, various merit badges, etc.,
Put together a list of clothing you will need, such as underwear, socks, t-shirts, sweaters, pants, shoes, and swimsuits.,
Look at what other things you will need for in/around camp, such as flashlights, a mess kit, canteen, sleeping bag, etc.,
Pack your clothing into a good-sized, colored duffel bag (or a hiking backpack if you have one) that you will be able to find easily in the dark.,
Pack a large lunch bag with some snacks and drinks.,
Provide some entertainment for yourself during your free time, and pack it.,
Pack everything in a neat and orderly fashion into a large duffel bag.,
Make sure you bring a lock for your box.",How to Pack for a Week at a Boy Scout Summer Camp," Grab a notebook and prepare to utilize your common sense. Write down what time of the year you are going, where the camp is located, what the local weather has been like in the past couple of weeks, how high the elevation is, if there is a lake, etc.;
, Is there a laundromat, showers, a mess hall, tents/cabins, etc.? Will you be able to wash your clothing at a common laundry station, or will you have to pack a week's worth of clothing? The answers to these questions will determine how much you will need to buy or pack.

, and what is required for them.

, Lay all of your clothing in groups on a flat surface, such as a bed, and put together a list. Packing too much is preferable to not packing enough.

, Lay these out next to your clothing. Don't forget a basic hygiene kit: toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, a towel, soap, shampoo, conditioner, a comb, and a washcloth.

, Make sure that all of your clothes and items are labeled clearly so they cannot be lost or stolen.

, Various juices, milk, and sodas are fine but water is always preferable to avoid dehydration. Some camps do not allow campers to bring their own food, so make sure this is allowed before you rush for refreshments.

, Bring books, music, art supplies, small toys, and games so you will have a variety of familiar things to do in your spare periods. You can carry these in a regular school-sized backpack that you take with you when you leave. Be sure this bag is not overpacked as most summer camps will offer many things to do other than merit badges.

, Do not simply stuff it all in carelessly; you may damage your items and it will be harder to save space. You may need more than one container if you are staying longer, or have a need for more clothes or materials. Take care that nothing is poking out of the trunk or pinched in the lid.

, This will keep out raccoons and other animals that may want your food. This will also prevent anything from being stolen.

Think about what you are looking for in a sled.,
Think about what conditions of snow you normally get in winter.,
Consider your sledding style.,
Go on the internet and find a cheap one, while making sure that the prices are not so low that you know that they are pieces of junk.",How to Pick Out a Sled," Speed? Control? Durability? Match the sled type to the desired outcome:

Plastic saucers will get you a chaotic amount of speed. They are also very durable. They offer almost no control.
Foam sliders are somewhere in between fast, and controllable. They are not too durable, as they will fold if bent excessively.
Rubber tubes are like Bowser in Mario Kart. Fast, heavy, and next-to-impossible to control.
Carpet sleds are fragile for a sled, and are pretty cheap, but they aren't great at doing their job.;
, Powder? A thin layer with ice underneath? Wet?

Foam and rubber tube sleds will go nicely on any type of snow. 
Plastic saucers will go slowly on thick powder snow, anything else will get you to pee your pants. Same story with carpet sleds.

, This will impact the type of sled you go for.

Plastic is good for the aggressive sledder.
Foam is good for the person who is both aggressive and serious.
Carpet is good for that little kid with anxiety.
Rubber tubes will satisfy the person who owns a 4-door Aston Martin, meaning that they like to just chill out while putting themselves at risk.

,  Now you can go sledding with a sled that you enjoy. Have fun."
"
Choose a sled for ice or for snow.,
Wear a helmet if necessary.,
Choose a safe hill.,
Sit facing forward.,
Learn to steer your sled.,
Bail out if you lose control.",How to Sled1," Thin, blade-like runners will increase speed on icy surfaces. Sleds that slide along one large base without runners are better for deep snow, since they distribute the rider's weight more evenly and reduce sinking.Sleds with wide runners are somewhere in between. Most casual sledders just use one sled for all terrain, but if you're buying your first sled, pick one that will work on the hills you expect to be trying.


Sleds with metal runners or sliding surfaces tend to be faster than wooden or plastic sleds, since they create less friction. Metal sleds are usually more expensive, though.
Sleds with runners and steering mechanisms are the safest type of sled for children.This may not hold true for high speed sledding.;
, Most people don't think of sledding as a dangerous sport, but serious or fatal sledding injuries do occur regularly. Wearing a helmet is an excellent idea for children, as well as for adults who are sledding down steep, tall, icy, or obstacle-laden slopes.



Thick winter clothing usually gives enough protection for the rest of the body.

, Find a hill completely covered by snow or ice, since dry patches can stop your sled.Never sled on a hill covered in obstacles, or one that ends in a parking lot, a street, or a body of water. If there are other people around, choose a side of the hill where you won't run into them.

, Stay seated while the sled is moving, and face forward at all times. Do not face backwards, lie down face-first, or try to spin the sled, as this can make a crash much riskier.Some sleds are designed for the rider to lie face-first, but these should only be used in specially prepared lanes at winter resorts, or by experienced sledders., You can steer by leaning in the direction you want to turn, or by putting your foot out into the snow on that side. To slow down or stop, put both feet out into the snow. Larger sleds and sleds with runners often have ropes you can pull to turn the sled, or more rarely a steering wheel or other unusual mechanism. If you need to turn very suddenly or at high speed, use multiple steering techniques (for instance, lean and put out a boot at the same time).


Tube-shaped and disc-shaped sleds can be very difficult to steer, and should only be used on wide, open areas with no obstacles – or preferably in special lanes in ""tubing parks"" and other winter recreation areas.

, If you lose control and the sled is going too fast for you to stop, cover your face and head with your arms, then roll out the side of the sled."
"
Stay safe.,
Wax your sled.,
Pack and freeze the snow.,
Keep your sled smooth and clean.",How to Sled2," These steps can make your sled go much faster. Do a test run on a small, easy slope first, and wear a helmet to protect yourself from injury.

, Glide wax is a great, easy option for making wooden or metal sleds go faster. If you don't want to buy a specialized product, you can use cooking grease or paraffin (candle) wax. Liquid wax can be rubbed over the bottom of the sled, left for ten minutes, then buffed with a nylon brush. If you are using a more solid wax for wooden sleds, you'll need to warm up your sled with a hairdryer or other heat source first, then work in the wax using a brush.


You can even bring along non-stick cooking spray to give your sled an extra slick surface right before going down a hill.Check the label on ski wax before using. You want ""glide wax,"" not ""grip wax.""

, Sled down the same spot to pack the snow down and make a flatter, faster track. If the temperature is below freezing and you have some time, spray the track with water and wait until it freezes. Repeat several times to make a slick, icy track., Use a cloth to wipe off dirt from the underside of your sled. If your sled has developed a rough or bumpy surface, use fine-grit sandpaper to smooth it out again. A layer of paint over the freshly sanded surface will slow down the pace of further damage.If you wax your sled, check the wax regularly to see if its become dirty or flaking. If it has, scrape it off with a putty scraper at a 45º angle.

Wait for it to snow, it won't work as a sled in mud!,
Dig out the inflatable air mattress, preferably a double one, out of the attic/loft.

,
Remember to grab the foot pump and a cycle helmet!

,
Find some friends, the heavier set the better for extra speed.

,
Drive out somewhere hilly and select a field with as few walls as possible.

,
Seek the Farmer's permission to use his field otherwise you may come face to face with a shotgun.

,
Walk down the sled run.,
Don goggles, hats and cycle helmet.

,
The shiny side of the mattress should be the one in contact with the snow.

Sled during the daytime.,
Pay attention to the weather conditions.,
Avoid the people around you.,
Wear warm clothing.,
Wear a helmet.,
Don't overfill the sled with people.",How to Go Sledding," Sledding down the hill head first makes it harder to steer and leaves your skull vulnerable to impacts if you fall off the sled. Instead, sled down the hill feet first to stay safe., While you are on a hill, leaning backward in a toboggan, sled, or saucer will slow you down. You can also pull back the sled's steering strings to help you decelerate., When using a toboggan or traditional sled, you can steer using your feet. Stick your left heel softly into the snow to turn left or stick your right heel into the snow to turn right. Make sure that you are using your heel, and not your toes or your feet may get caught in the snow.Do not dig your feet deep into the snow or you may hurt yourself.
If you want to slow down or stop, you can put both heels into the snow.
Don't plant your toes into the snow when on an incline or you may flip your sled over or injure yourself.

, If you are going to hit a tree or rock, it's better if you bail out of the sled instead of hitting it. To bail out of the sled, cover your head and eyes with your arms and roll out of the sled.Make sure that there are no people sledding behind you, or else they may run you over when you bail.

, When looking for a good sledding hill, you'll want to make sure that it isn't too steep and is free of obstructions like rocks, trees, or shrubs. You'll also want to ensure that the hill doesn't lead into any roads or parking lots.Avoid icy hills.
Get permission first if the hill isn't on your property.

, Many local parks have hills that are perfect for sledding. Do a search online to find parks near you. Go to the park after it snows to see if other people are sledding to get ideas., Certain ski and snowboarding parks will also have tubing available for a fee. If you don't feel like purchasing a sled, these parks are an excellent option. Typically tubing hills will allow you to rent a tube and buy tickets to sled., Simple sleds that are made for young children are often easier and more intuitive to maneuver, while more elaborate sleds, like tubes, could make steering a sled difficult. If you are purchasing a sled, make sure to follow the recommended age restrictions on the packaging., Toboggans are flat with a curved front and are usually made of wood. Toboggans are an excellent choice if you have younger children who need supervision when going down the hill because they usually fit more than one person.You can use your feet to help steer your toboggan.

, Plastic sleds and saucers are usually the most affordable sleds that you can get. These sleds break easily and are the hardest to steer and control. Consider these sleds if you're on a limited budget., Steerable sleds offer the most control over the sled if you know what you are doing. If you are a sledding veteran and don't mind paying a bit more for your sled, this is a great option.Steerable sleds will usually have a lever or steering wheel that will help you control your sled.

, Snow tubes are among the fastest sleds but are also the hardest to control. Typically, you should avoid using a snow tube unless you are sledding down a designated hill or at a snow park.

, Reduced visibility can be dangerous and cause someone to lose control of their sled. Avoid sledding at night unless the hill is well-lit and free of obstructions. If you are sledding at a commercial sledding hill, then there should be plenty of lighting to keep you safe., If there is a snow storm or limited visibility, it could make sledding unsafe. Also, ice buildup on a hill can make it dangerously slippery and not ideal for sledding. Make sure to take note of the environment, and leave the hill if the weather gets too severe., When sledding, it's important that you keep track of other people sledding around you. When you get to the bottom of the hill, move out of the way so that other people don't sled into you. Similarly, don't point your sled in anyone's direction when you are sledding., When you go sledding, it's important that you protect yourself from the cold. Wear gloves, a hat, winter jacket, winter boots, and warm pants. Make sure that your winter gear is waterproof so that it doesn't get soaked after sledding. Avoid wearing loose scarves or anything else that can be snagged while sledding.Extended exposure to cold without the proper attire can lead to frostbite.

, A helmet will protect your head if you fall off your sled while you are sledding. Get a helmet that is made specifically for winter sports for the best protection.If you don't have access to a winter sports helmet, you can wear a biking or skateboarding helmet instead.

, You shouldn't try to fit more people in the sled than are specified in the sled's instructions. If your sled is made for one person, make sure that only one person is going down the hill at one time.There are some sleds that are made for two or more people.

Make sure that there is snow in the spot that you would like to sled on.,
Get to the top of a hill and take care to pick a hill that isn't too large.,
Know that you now need your trash bag.,
Shove off.,
Understand that if you are using multiple bags, then at this point you need to hold them together so they don't come apart while you are sledding.,
Make sure that when you reach the bottom, you put your hands down to stop.,
Finished.

",How to Go Sledding With a Trash Bag," Measure the depth of the snow as it should be at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) deep because you will not have the sled's hard bottom to protect you from rocks and bumps.;
, If it's too large the ride might be a little scary. If it is too small then it won't be as fun.

, It is preferred that the trash bag be big enough to fit 2/3 of your body, but as long as you cover "" your bottom "" it will work.


If you can't find a bag big enough to get above your waist then you will have to get two or more bags. Tear one big hole in the bottom of all but one of the bags. Then slide the bags that are torn up to your chest. Then pull the bag without the hole over your feet.






Make sure that no clothing beneath your waist is showing. The cloth will catch on the snow and slow you down or even send you out of control.







, Sit down at the top of the hill that you intend to slide down. Hopping gently is the best way to get to the edge without tearing the bags. When you are to the edge you will need to sit down with your legs extended straight out in front of you.

,


When you are in position and ready to go, push your hands against the ground to get some forward motion going. not much force is necessary to get you going.






While flying down the hill, lean from side to side to steer your way around interfering objects.







, Either this or throw yourself to the ground.

Go out and teach your dog the basics : you will be jogging, and your goal is to teach the dog this is not a normal walk: he does not have to walk slowly, stop often to sniff around, pee and so on, but to run with you and never stop all time long.,
When the dog runs faster than you, being in front of you, praise him and run faster yourself to encourage this behaviour.

,
Commands: always say ""GO"" when you start, and ""WHOA"" in the end, when you stop.,
Start off adjusting your speed and the duration of your training session to your dog's physical condition: you might want to start by just walking for a few minutes.,
Be patient: bear in mind you do not train a dog for sled dog in a few days, but it takes at least a year ( for an athletic dog, already fit and well muscled when starting )

,
Pulling: when the dog will learn it is about always running in front of you, faster than you, start slowing down and making your dog feel your weight.,
Biking: tie your dog to your bike, and encourage him to run, pulling, in front of you as usual.,

first of all, have your vet do a check up of your dog's condition: you need your vet approval before starting.",How to Dog Sled," Then, try to make the dog put his head into the collar: don't push him if he is scared, but bring the harness very slowly closer and closer to the dog head, till he will have worn it; if he gets scared, freeze where you are, let him calm down, and then continue from where you stopped;
,, You will do this by praising him when he runs, recalling him and encouraging him to resume running when he stops.

,, Also add 2 more words ( like ""SLOW"" and ""RUN"" ), when you decelerate and when you increase your speed. At the beginning, you will start on straight paths: later go where there are some crossroads too: you will repeat ""LEFT"" or ""RIGHT"" any time you turn one or another direction.

, If you are not sure, ask your vet about any doubt! Then, over weeks, slowly add speed and duration. Again, if in doubt, ask your vet, and anyway, better do less than the dog could do, than doing more and hurting him.

,, Keep on praising and encouraging him when he runs in front if you, pulling you. If you notice he is unsure about what to do, increase your speed to make him understand he does have to run in front of you, faster than you, even if you are slowing down.

, At the beginning, do not ride the bike, but run by its side: once the dog will fully understand how to behave, you can start actually riding

, This step is not much different than passing from jogging to biking, but sled for sled dog are difficult to handle if you are not used to. Also, to pull one, you need at least three dogs, of the same size and weight.

, Also, this is a demanding activity so it is important your dog is fit and well muscled to avoid injuries.

, Also follow his/her warnings on how to proceed.
when you start, start with something that is not more demanding than your dog's usual activity: if he is used to walking for 5 minutes a day, start with a 5 minutes walk.
add difficulties gradually and slowly: a general rule is that when the dog, once home, stops being as tired as usual but only appears satisfied and still ready to go, it is time to add duration/speed. For example: you start off with a 20 minutes walk, and once home your dog is not willing to do anything more for the whole day; let's say that after 2 weeks, he comes home tired but after, say, 6 hours he is ready to play and run again: then, you can start adding difficulties, for example from 20 to 25/30 minutes walk
train your dog for many activities: only doing one kind of activity/training and nothing else is unhealthy and can lead to injuries ( it happens with humans too ). Instead, alternate sled dog/running training with at least 2 other completely different sports, like disc dog ( lots of jumping ), agility ( jumping and sprinting ), swimming, etc. Also, teach your dog ""tricks"" ( things like: roll on the floor, give paw, etc. You can find many examples if you search for ""dog tricks"" on youtube ): they develop strength, agility and flexibility in dogs, which lead to less injuries, better performance, longer life and better health for the dog.
do not overtrain your dog: learn and respect his limit, never force him to do something he is scared of, uncomfortable with. Always bear in mind that doing a bit less than your dog could, will cause no damage, while doing only a little bit more, might cause serious injuries, that might take very long to heal. Also, as said before, train your dog for many different activities, not only sled dog

Mark out an area to build the Igloo in.,
Before starting on building the actual Igloo, determine what kind of snow you are dealing with.,
Find a mold to make the bricks out of.,
Use a snow shovel to fill the mold with snow, then pack it down.,
Clear snow out of the area where the igloo will be built: it will make sure the igloo does not become uneven as the surrounding snow begins to melt and refreeze.

,
After you have the mold filled, turn it upside down at the site of the igloo where you want the brick placed.,
Remember to leave a small area (about a two feet wide and two feet tall) at the base open for a door.

,
Continue adding layers, steadily sloping inward.,
Build a cap.,
Feel free to make smaller(or not) igloos joined to your first one by tunnels for multiple sleeping quarters/storage.

,
Consider adding a chimney.",How to Make a Sturdier Igloo," An ideal area should be flat, lacking tall grasses or shrubs, and have a foot of snow or more. A good measurement is to make a snow angel and build around that. If the diameter(from the edge to the opposite edge) of the igloo is more than 10 feet(3.2 meters), it will require a perfect dome, which is not practical to build out of snow.;
, Dry powdery snow is not ideal for Igloos. Wet heavy snow is better. If all you have is powdery snow, make the igloo lower to the ground and smaller than you normally would. If the snow has sheets of ice in it or it is ice, compacting it will take longer and the igloo will have to be lower to the ground than normal.

, The smaller the size, the longer it will take but the more structurally sound the Igloo will be. Larger blocks will be quicker, but will have larger spaces in between the individual blocks. An ideal mold will be 12in long, 8in high, ~10in wide. The mold should have a bottom and a removable top, ideally. A flexible mold(plastic/thin metal) is easier to get snow out of than a thick, wooden one. Do not use a shoe box for this: it will wear away into nothing after awhile.

, The more fragile your mold, the more gentile you should be when packing the snow in. Pack it down and add snow as needed until the compressed snow is somewhere near the top of the mold.

,, Repeat until you have one layer done. Scoop unpacked snow betwixt the cracks of the blocks for extra insulation.

,, To avoid collapses, build a support beam by stacking several bricks on top of each other perpendicular to one of the walls(and on the wall opposite it).

, Once you get to the point where the open top part of the igloo has a diameter of about two feet, you'll need to build a giant ""cap"" to put on top. The cap should be much thinner than the rest of the igloo and it should be very well packed. Place it on top. Congratulations, you know have a usable igloo.

,, Adding a chimney for fires(better idea than it sounds) can be simple: cut a small(~6in) hole at the top and add snow making it like a funnel facing towards the sky. This will allow smoke to filter out without letting too much snow/rain/sleet in.

Recruit some friends.,
Develop the snow house floor plan.,
Clear out an area that will fit your floor plan.,
Draw you floor plan using a stick or dowel so that everyone understands where to place the snow bricks.,
Assign roles and begin building:

Brick Maker(s) - This person (or group) will pack the snow into bricks to be laid.,
Create bricks by hand or using a form.,
Build in a circle, starting with the ground level first.,
Close in the inside brick layers and cut through the walls to form openings, starting at the base and working upwards.,
Add more rooms or houses as necessary using the same method.",How to Make an Eskimo Snow House," It is nigh to impossible to build a snow house by yourself -- even the Inuit help each other -- so find some friends to help you.;
, Inuit snow houses are dome-shaped or bee-hive shaped and have a circular base. As you become more skilled in creating floor plans, feel free to add more rooms and additional houses. Experimenting is part of the fun!

, You will need to include the house, of course, but also working area around the house so that you can build and have free range of motion.

, Use measuring tape or a yardstick to get your dimensions to match your design.

, See more instructions below for how the bricks should be formed.






Outside Brick Layer(s) - This person (or group) takes the snow bricks and lays them according to plan. They will also smooth out the edges and shave the bricks to make them taper to form the dome.






Inside Brick Layer(s) - This person (or group) will assist in laying the bricks down and smoothing the edges inside the house. They should be responsible for ensuring the proper tapering to create the dome structure.







, A form is the easiest method to ensure standard-sized bricks. You can make your own form by nailing together 4 planks of wood to make a rectangle brick. Pack the snow inside and tap out of the form for use. The bricks should gradually get less and less thick as you build upward. The base bricks should be the thickest as they are supporting the most weight.

, Gradually taper the bricks as you build upward, careful not to taper too much (see Warnings below). Brick layers should smooth the edges using extra snow as ""mortar"" to fill in any gaps. Use a flat edge, like a trowel or plank of wood, to create smooth walls.

, Don't make too many openings as this will decrease the stability of the structure. Usually a door is all that is necessary.

, Experiment by placing additional rooms adjacent to the existing house by using the same snow walls (see image).

Make snow bricks.,
After you have several bricks, put them on the ground in a row making a circle shape.,
Add five more layers.,
Remember to work from the inside when the fort starts looking like a semi-cylinder.

,
Start making a central circle inside the fort, taking bricks your team is making on the outside.

,
Add the final layers on the central tower and then fill it with snow balls.

,
Cut a small hole beside the tower, and dig sideways in to the tower at the bottom of the hole.,
Take your knife and cut a small hole next to the bottom, then dig sideways outwards, then carefully cut an arch out of the bricks.,
Take in extra snow and compact it on the ground until you get kind of a sofa.",How to Build the Snow Fort Operation Rogue,"


You can make a snow brick by taking a square bucket and filling it with snow and eventually overflowing the bucket.






Pack the snow into the bucket with a shovel. Add more on. Pack it again, and take the brick out of the bucket. You now have 1 brick.

Cut a narrow rectangular trench to prepare to harvest blocks.,
Harvest your blocks and begin assembling your first row.,
Cut a slope into your first row of snow blocks.,
Level and shape igloo walls when necessary.,
Add blocks cut from the snow inside the igloo perimeter.,
Fit your cap-hole blocks carefully.,
Carve vents in your igloo to prevent CO2 poisoning.,
Cut your entrance.,
Clear your entrance way.,
Strengthen your exterior with snow and enjoy your igloo.",How to Build an Igloo," Of course, an igloo can be built on flat land without any problems, but by building your igloo into a hillside, the slope will cut down on the surface area of your igloo dome. Less surface area means fewer bricks, and fewer bricks mean less work for you.


In survival situations, a hillside building site should be prioritized.
Avoid free-standing mounds, as these are likely logs or boulders buried in snow.
Use a snow prod or a long stick to verify usable space for your igloo.;
, Ideally, you'll want to cut the bricks of your igloo from snow that is hard packed with no soft layers of soft snow in it. Use your snow prod or a long stick to check the snow, which should offer firm, uniform resistance if hard packed throughout.Measure the depth of your snow while checking consistency. You'll want the snow to be at least 2 feet (0.61 m) deep to make your igloo.

, Use the heel of your boot to scuff out a line marking the circular outside of your igloo. The snow on the inside of your circle should all be consistently hard packed, and your circle should be regular in shape.









A poorly outlined outer wall will result in your igloo's design being less stable and sturdy.

Never build a dome with a diameter larger than 10 feet (3.0 m), as it will require you to build a perfect dome. This is a nearly impossible task, even with special tools., You'll soon be using snow blocks cut from the snow inside the outer perimeter of your igloo to build the walls of your igloo dome. You'll be building from the inside out, cutting the door of your structure after finishing your dome from the inside., Depending on the size of your igloo, the size of your blocks can change, but traditionally igloo blocks are 3 feet (0.91 m) long, 15 inches (38 cm) high, and about 8 inches (20 cm) thick. Cut a narrow rectangular trench with your snow knife to accommodate several blocks this size.









Cut your trench in a way that places one of its short ends flat against the outer perimeter line of your igloo.
The place your trench and outer wall boundaries meet will eventually become your outside door.
If working on a slope or building your igloo into a hillside, dig your trench directly toward the slope.
A handsaw or machete can be used in place of a snow knife., Section the hard packed snow inside the perimeter of your rectangular trench into equal rectangular blocks. Stubborn blocks can be broken free by sticking your snow tool into the cut around the block and gently wiggling it back and forth until the block is broken free. Then arrange your blocks around the perimeter of your igloo to create the first layer of your dome.








Your blocks should be 3 feet (0.91 m) long, 15 inches (38 cm) high, and about 8 inches (20 cm) thick, and should taper slightly as you build upward.
Run your snow knife, machete, or handsaw along the edges of your first row of blocks where one block joins the next. This will smooth contours and help fit each block together tightly.
When your rectangular trench no longer has snow for blocks, cut another trench the same dimensions as the first. All the snow used in building your dome should come from within the perimeter of the igloo., Due to the rectangular shape of your blocks, you will need to cut a gentle slope inclining from the ground all the way to the top height of your first row of snow blocks. This incline should extend part way around your igloo (perhaps even as much as halfway), and should be cut with your snow knife, machete, or handsaw.









This incline will allow your blocks to be stacked in a vertical spiral, creating a snug fit., This will make stacking and layering the ice blocks much easier. Additionally, as you build your dome upward, you will need to shape your snow blocks to fit the reduced space at the top of your dome. Use your snow knife, machete, or handsaw to do this as necessary.









Each row of your igloo dome should slope gradually inward. Use your snow knife, machete, or saw to create a very gentle inward slope for each row of snow blocks.
Using your hand, plug any gaps you find in your dome from the inside with snow. Simply pat snow into the gap until it is filled., Continue to liberate blocks from the snow within your igloo perimeter with your snow knife/machete, and then stack your next layer starting from the sloping end of your first row. As your dome wall rises, blocks will begin to decrease in size and slope inward.









To increase stability and prevent ceiling blocks from falling, bevel the edges where ceiling blocks meet the row beneath.
To bevel, cut the inside corner of your ceiling block so that it forms a flat base with its neighboring block beneath., The topmost blocks in your igloo dome are notoriously tricky to fit into place, so take your time and work carefully during this leg of your igloo building. Use your snow knife/machete to sculpt these pieces to fit tightly together.









Since your final hole will be exceptionally small, you will have to turn your final block on its end and feed it through the hole on its side.
When your final cap-hole piece is balanced on the outer top part of the dome, cut it down to fit in place snugly with your snow knife/machete., Your body heat will cause the snow of your dome to melt and then freeze again, creating a barrier between the inside and outside of your igloo. Without ventilation this seal will prevent the CO2 that you exhale from escaping, and could seriously harm you.Cut small, crescent shaped vents into the top or sides of your igloo to prevent the buildup of CO2., Now that you have the dome of your igloo created and some vents carved into place, you're ready to make an entrance. Use your snow knife/machete to cut a rectangle from the bottom of your block deep igloo base to about eye-level high, while crouching, in your dome wall. Your cut should be as deep as your dome wall is thick.Try to preserve this block by pulling it inside the igloo. You can save this block to create an overhang for your entrance.

, Remove the remaining snow from your entrance in an gentle upward slope. You can pull this snow inside your igloo and use it for further patching gaps from the inside, or you can simply push it outside. Once your sloped entrance is finished, take the rectangular block you cut free of your dome wall and turn it on its side to remove it from your igloo. Then:









Cut the rectangular dome-wall block in half.
Lean each half of your block inward over your entrance trench so that each one holds the other up in an upside down V shape.
This upside V overhang for your entrance should be as close to the mouth of the entrance as possible, to provide the most protection., Your igloo can be made even more durable to patching thin spots and gaps with more snow. Some gaps may be most easily patched from the inside, while you might have better access to others from outside. In either case, use your hand to press the snow into the gap and then smooth the area to pack it together.








You should be able to assess the stability of your igloo by touch. If the blocks feel solid and sturdy, your igloo should withstand the elements.
Even if your igloo is a little on the rickety side, in the event of a cave-in, you'll be able to dig yourself free from the snow easily.

Cover yourself when necessary.,
If possible, try to create forts made out of tightly packed snow to hide behind.,
Use teamwork!,
Trick your opponents.,
Fight a defensive battle if you are losing, but never an evasive battle.",How to Win a Snowball Fight," Cover is important so using trees and other barriers is something to consider. You will even need cover when you are advancing if your team is on the offense.;
,


An effective tactic is to pour water on top of your snow forts. The water will then freeze and form an ice layer which will strengthen your barricade even further.
Keep a stash of snowballs at your fort or base area to use in an emergency.

, If you're playing with a group try to get an opponent singled out and focus your snowballing efforts, split up and attack from different directions.

, Act like you are retreating, but have reinforcements waiting behind a hill or trees, and lead the enemy right to them!

, If you keep retreating, your team will be confined to a small area and surrounded. Hold your ground, and have a huge pile of snowballs with you.

Think about what kind of structure you want to make.,
Measure the size of the fort.,
Find a good snowdrift.,
Make sure the snow is dense and not loose.,
Use snow bricks if you can't get strong snow.,
Make your walls.,
Pack the outside of your walls with a shovel.,
Pour water over the fort for a protective layer of ice.,
Sprinkle cold water and food coloring on the fort to customize the color.,
To illuminate your fort, string low-power LED lights around it.,
Add flags, snowmen, or other decorations.",How to Build a Snow Fort," Snow forts can be anything from a simple one-wall design to more complex fortresses with four walls and a roof.


Part of this decision depends on how much snow you have.
Take into account length, depth and height as you estimate the amount of snow you'll need. Four feet is usually an adequate height.;
, Use a shovel or branch to mark out the fort's perimeter. If you're low on snow, opt for a single wall with two wings on either side., If you don't have one, make it! Use shoveled snow from the driveway or anywhere else.

, Test the snow by making a ball in your hands. If it sticks, the snow is prime for building. If not, see the next step for making your own denser snow., Pack Tupperware containers, coolers, or plastic buckets full of as much snow as will fit, invert, and lift off the container. Alternatively, pour cold water over the snow to make a layer of ice. If you're planning to dig a tunnel, leave a space with no water poured over it so you can dig more easily.

, Use the packed snow or bricks to form walls, making sure that they are perpendicular on the inside of the fort.


If you're using bricks, work like a bricklayer: put down one layer, leaving a few inches (or centimeters) between each brick, and stacking the next level so that each brick straddles two underneath it. Have another person follow you by packing snow in between the bricks.
If you're digging a fort into a snowdrift, use a shovel or your hands and burrow your way into the pile. Once you've made your entrance, clear out a room from the inside with your hands or a small shovel.

, Smooth out the exterior of the walls, adding in extra snow for support if necessary. If you've used bricks, fill in the cracks in between the snow bricks, then smooth out with a shovel. Be careful not to break the blocks in doing so. The outside walls should slant just slightly for durability. , The water freezes into ice, solidifying the structure and protecting it from melting.


Work from the bottom up to avoid ice overbearing the top and collapsing.Make sure it's below freezing outside when you do this so the water turns quickly into ice., Dye the blocks as you make them by adding colored water to the snow, spritz colored water from a spray bottle, or mix food coloring in with the cold water you pour over as a finish.

, Low-powered lights generate minimal heat to reduce melting., If there's an abundance of snow, make guardian snowmen or turrets for your fort. Add some furniture if you have room. Carve designs into the exterior of the walls to customize your construction.

Challenge a friend.",How to Throw a Snowball," Gloves are essential if you want to avoid cold hands or potential hypothermia. It is applied pressure that makes a snow stick together, so heat from bare hands will not make forming your snowball easier.


Gloves or mittens with some waterproof coating will be your best bet, as they often provide extra gripping, which shields your hands from the getting wet while forming and throwing your snowballs.;
, You can't throw a snowball without any snow. Make sure that the snow is the right consistency. Look for snow that is moist and dense enough to pack into a ball. If you can't pack the snow, you won't be able to throw it. Powder will not work, and icy snow doesn't pack well either.Snow is made of ice crystals, so you need to apply pressure to get some crystals to melt. The ice will re-freeze, causing the snow to stick together.Avoid finding a hard piece of ice to throw because even though it is already compact, throwing this type of ""snow"" is dangerous.

, Start by grabbing a clump of snow. The amount of snow you grab will determine the size of your snowball.Then, cup your hands around it and pack it into a tight lump that will be able to fly through the air without falling apart.

, Use your hands to round the snow into a spherical shape. Move your hands around the surface of the snow to smooth it. As long as the snow is in a rough ball shape, it will be able to soar through the air.

, It is important that you remain calm before you take aim so that you can focus on your target. Tune out any distractions and stay present in the moment., Aim with your dominant eye. The snowball is likely to land wherever your eyes are trained, so do not overlook this step. Practice aiming with each eye to discover which of your eyes is more dominant.

, Stand with your feet placed below your shoulders, and then widen your stance slightly. Keep your feet directed at your target, and bend your knees a bit. Practice your positioning until you feel comfortable. The more you practice throwing snowballs in this position, the more naturally it will come to you.

, It is best to throw it in the same way that you would a pitch a baseball. Place the snowball in your dominant hand. Grip it tightly, as you do not want the snow to fall apart before you throw. Pull your hand back, behind your head. At a high speed, move your hand forward and release the snowball when your arm is outstretched.Never take your eyes off of your target. This way, you will increase your chances of hitting your target accurately.

, Start throwing snowballs at a target, such as a tree. Once you are able to hit your target most of the time, start moving farther away from it to improve your accuracy and precision. This is a good opportunity to experiment with different kinds of snow, various packing methods, and several throwing techniques in order to master your skills.

, If you are engaging in a snowball fight, you will need to be ready with more than one snowball. Prepare a supply of snowballs beforehand, or learn how to make new snowballs quickly so that you can outdo your opponent.

, Invite your friends to partake in a snowball fight! Just be sure to set some ground rules, such as to avoid hitting one another in the face. It could be useful to come up with and agree upon a signal or safe word, in case the game ends up going too far and someone wants to stop playing.

The team with the winning coin toss gets the uphill location, or better vantage point. The other team has to make do with the other location. Keep both locations within throwing distance though, to keep things fun.


Try to find a spot uphill from your opponent's fort. Throwing downhill is easier than throwing uphill. It is also easier to defend an upward spot from invasions because the enemy has to climb uphill. If you want to invade the enemy's fortification you can slide downhill, throwing snow balls, rather than climbing up. Generally speaking, uphill is better.
Alternatively, both build on a flat spot. At least you're equal in advantage then.;
, This is done by shoveling snow into a large pile on the top of the location.

, With shovels and your hands, push the snow together to make a more solid front wall. The head will be hit the most by snowballs so it needs to be strong. The final product should have a head almost as tall as you and double as wide as all the players.

, On each side, pile up snow a bit lower than the head. The sides will be important in case of an invasion.

, Just as you packed the front wall, pack the side walls. The side walls should each be up to your waist. The taller the better.

, In part of your fortress, dig enough snow out to hold a good amount of snowballs. The more you have already made, the faster you can aim at your opponent.

, The water will freeze, creating a layer of ice around the fort which strengthens it.

, You could add team colors as banners, shields or signs.

Consider awarding prizes for best built and best decorated fortress. These prizes could form part of the ""booty"" to be stolen during the snow battle.

,, Work out the method for attacking one another. This is just about tossing snowballs at each other, it's also about taking the fortress of the opposing team. This means that you'll need rules for invasion, including whether it's okay to destroy a fortress (or not).

Have a points system for snowball hits on people and on the fortress. For example, every 5 snowball hits could equal a major injury and the team player has to sit it out for five minutes, or 10 hits is fatal and the player has to go inside and make hot chocolate for everyone. Or, fifteen hits to the fortress could be considered damage. Come up with your own preferred rules, or perhaps play for a bit to find out what works best, then make the rules.
Have a points system or rules for invasion of the fortress (for example, only one person inside could mean one point while having the whole opposing team inside means the fortress is now lost).
Don't physically destroy either snow fortress if you want to play the game again. When you've all decided you're sick of it though, actual fortress destruction could form part of the last game played. Be careful to ensure that nobody is inside when the fortress is dismantled.

, You could take turns in making and ferrying snowballs, then throwing them. This gives everyone a chance to play different roles.,"

You can then transfer it to a larger container, like a bathtub or insulated cooler, which will let you keep your activities confined to one area.Look for clean, fresh patches of snow clear of any dirt, sticks or leaves.
Snow sometimes comes into contact with icky things on the ground, so don’t forget to wash your containers after use.;
, If the heat is on full blast, the snow will be gone before you really have a chance to do much with it. Turn down the thermostat a few degrees and shut off any space heaters in the area where you’ll be playing. This way, you’ll be able enjoy it longer.


Wear gloves when you’re handling the snow to keep your hands from getting cold.

, Keep the snow cold when it’s not in use. If the container you used to collect it is too big to fit in the freezer, you can move it to a plastic shopping bag or piece of Tupperware. Just be sure to get your fun in quickly—after a day or two, the snow will most likely freeze into one solid block.


If you keep your supply of snow stored correctly, you’ll be able to keep playing with it longer after the rest has melted.
Keep snow separated from any open food or drink items in the freezer.

Once your castle is complete you can stop and admire your handiwork, or just crush it and start over again.If you want to get elaborate, you can give your castle a moat, a spire or even a drawbridge made of ice cubes.

, A giant bin of snow can make a much more exciting play setting than the living room floor. Sensory bins allow you to interact with the snow directly, even when it's too cold to go outside. As you play, the snow will begin to melt and take on different forms, resulting in new types of creative opportunities.Get hands-on.

Set snowballs aside for a bit, if possible.,
Do not throw snowballs that contains ice.,
Do not throw snowballs at vehicles.,
Use a safety word.,
Bundle up.",How to Make the Perfect Snowball," Light, powdery snow does not contain a lot of moisture or air, making it difficult to pack into a snowball. For the best snowballs, seek out snow from areas where the ground may be warmer. Wetter snow makes for better snowballs.Heat is often given off by a house. Snow close to buildings may be warmer than average.
Snow that's exposed to the sun may be warmer than snow you would find in the shade.
If you can't find warmer snow, lie down on the ground for a few minutes. The heat from your body will melt the snow slightly, adding moisture. This will make for better snowballs.
If it's possible, choose to have a snowball fight during the afternoon. Snow tends to be more shapeable when the weather is slightly warmer, so playing when the sun is out can give you a better selection of snow.;
, Temperatures right around freezing are best for making snowballs. The snow is warm enough that's it's shapeable, without being wet to the point of sloppy or slushy. If it's around 32 degrees Fahrenheit out, this is the best time to have a snowball fight. If possible, play when the weather is around 32 degrees., Snowballs are best when they're firm and packed. Snow that's slightly below the surface has already been packed together by the pressure from the snow and ice above. If there's more than a few inches of snow on the ground, reach below the surface to gather snow for a snowball., When seeking out snow, make sure it's free of dirt and debris. Pick snow from an area that's not near the road. You may want to sift through snow before picking it up. Look out for things like animal urine or feces, rocks, twigs, and other hard objects.

, When it comes to making a snowball, gloves are key. Mittens do not allow as much hand movement, preventing you from adequately shaping your snowball. Also, mittens tend to allow less heat to escape. A small amount of heat is good for a snowball. It melts the snow slightly, allowing you to shape it easier., To start making your snowball, cup your hands. Dip them into the ground and pick up about a handful of snow in each hand. This is slightly more than a half a cup of snow in each hand., From here, bring your hands together. Start rotating your hands. This motion will help fuse the snow together. Slowly and rhythmically rotate your hands while pressing the two clumps of snow together., With each rotation, increase the pressure. The perfect snowball will be firmly packed. You should increase pressure gradually, however. Putting too much pressure on the snowball too soon will result in the snow crumbling. Be patient. Start rotating with a small amount of pressure, and gradually increase as you go., After awhile, the snow will get harder and harder to maneuver. You will start feeling resistance, which is a sign your snowball is almost complete. Stop rotating the snowball and transfer it to one hand. Use the hand not holding the snowball to smooth out rough edges to form a nice oval shape., If you're able to do so, it's a good idea to set your snowballs aside before you begin a snowball fight. The pressure and heat from your hands will cause the snowball to release moisture. When the snowballs are set out in the cold, the moisture will refreeze, making the snowball more firm., You should make sure there are no chunks of ice in the snow you use in a snowball. Throwing snowballs with ice can cause injuries to other players. Sift through snow before making a snowball to make sure it does not contain ice., Playing with snowballs can be a fun activity. However, you should never throw a snowball at a moving vehicle. This can result in a car accident. Stick to playing in the confines of your backyard or a local park.

, In the event someone is hurt, you should have a safety word to let other players know to stop. Snowball fights are usually safe, but injuries do happen. Choose a word, like ""Banana,"" and tell other players to yell that word in the event they're injured and need assistance. If someone yells the safety word, stop immediately and get help., If it's cold enough for a snowball fight, temperatures outside are below freezing. Make sure to bundle up in snow pants, scarves, gloves, hats, and other winter gear. Exposure to the cold for too long can result in potentially serious health problems like hypothermia."

Gather the materials.,
Find a suitable location.,
Find other people to help.",How to Build an Olaf (from Frozen) Snowman1," You not only need a carrot, you will also need a spray bottle filled with water, rocks or coal (best) for the eyes, twigs for the arms, bendy twigs for his hair, and flexible twigs or pipe cleaners for the eyebrows. If you really want to go all out, find an artifical purple flower to put in front of him. Gather all the materials before starting, unless you want to be tramping through the house wet with snow.;
, Resist the urge to build Olaf right on the curb where everyone will see (until the plow comes) and build one in the middle of your yard. Pack down the snow around it so Olaf doesn't topple over as a result of an uneven base.

, Though it is possible to build an Olaf by yourself, it will be much easier (and more fun) to do it with others. Try to find 2-4 other people to help you. Remember, too many cooks spoil the soup.

Stick the other twigs in the center of his body (the smallest ball).,
Using your other rocks, place one of them on the smallest ball, and the other two on the bottom.",How to Build an Olaf (from Frozen) Snowman2," They should be larger than your average snowball, but smaller than a traditional snowman head. Make them both the same size, and shaped like the earth—a flattened spheroid, just a little flat on the top and bottom. Spray them with the water bottle to make sure they are strong enough to hold the rest of the body up. Spray them, then wait about 30 seconds for the water to freeze.

, Make it an almost perfect sphere, but like the feet, make it flat on the ends. Spray it with the water bottle, then place it on top of the two feet. Put some snow to make sure it stays on the feet.

, Make it the same shape it would be if you joined the two feet, almost like a rectangle. This one is especially important to completely spray with water, as it is the most likely to fall apart. Place it on top of Olaf's body, making sure you can still see that it is two different balls.

, Spray it, almost drenching it. Do not place it on top of Olaf yet. Once it has frozen, spray it once again.

, This is where Olaf's eyes will go, as well as the carrot for his nose. Spray the fresh snow, and smooth off any rough edges. Then, make the top part of the right angle into a trapezoid. This is a major characteristic  that distinguishes Olaf from other snowmen, so spend a lot of time getting it perfect. Take a bit of snow off right where his mouth (and eventually teeth) will be.

, Form a small snowball, then cut it in half. Stick the semicircles to the top of Olaf's face, making sure they stay. Bring your rocks, and place them on top of those semi-circles. Use twigs to make the eyebrows. Put them high on his head with a pronounced arch, so he looks surprised.

, Using the twigs, stick three of them straight up on his head. Try to spread them out a bit so they look like his hair does in the movie.

, Rest it on the flat part of Olaf's face, sticking the very end right under his eyes.

, Put a chunk of snow right where his teeth will be, then carve away anything that will not be part of his teeth. Make the teeth very wide. Spray the area with water to ensure the teeth hold their shape.

, Because it is a strange shape, it may not balance at first. Put snow at the botton to keep it from falling off. Spray that area with water if desired.

, You can place them both down, or one up, or both up. In many scenes, Olaf is waving, so you may want to position one up and one down.

, Olaf's buttons are exactly this way, so if you are going for accuracy, make sure to follow the directions precisely.

Top off the snowman with a hat and scarf.",How to Make a Snowman," If your snow is too fluffy or powdery, you will not be able to make a snowman. Go out to the snow and scoop some up between both of your hands. Press it together, and if it forms into a ball, you’ll be able to make a snowman.If the snow falls apart, it’s no good for making a snowman. If you are determined, you can mix some water into the powdery snow as you roll it up, but this is not guaranteed to work.;
, If you build your snowman on a slope, it may topple over. You also don’t want to build on asphalt or cement because those store more heat, and your snowman might get in the way of you driving or walking. Make sure the area has enough snow for you to use, as well., If you want your snowman to last as long as possible without melting, build it somewhere that doesn’t get much direct sunlight. If there’s a big shady tree near you, that’s a great spot. Making the snowman close to a building also provides shade for some of the day.


This is just to help the snowman last longer. If you don’t have much shade around, that’s okay.

, Make sure you are wearing warm, waterproof gloves, or your hands will start to hurt from handling the snow. Scoop up a handful of snow with both hands. Pack it together into a round shape. Add snow to the ball in your hands until it is about one foot (30.5 cm) in diameter, or until it gets too heavy.








, Set the snowball on the ground and begin rolling it forward. As you roll, avoid making a cylinder by changing the direction you’re rolling the ball. Keep rolling until the ball is about three feet (about 1 meter) wide.








Stop rolling the snowball in the spot where you want the snowman to be. Make sure you start somewhere near that spot, and roll the ball so that you end up there.
It often works well to roll the ball in a large spiral, but take note that this will leave an obvious pattern in the snow.
Pat your snowball together every so often to keep excess snow from falling off.

, Scoop up some snow in both hands and pack it into a tight ball. Add more snow until the ball is too heavy to carry. Put it on the ground and roll it around as you did for the bottom section. This time, stop when the ball reaches about two feet (.6 meters) wide.








Roll the snowball in a circle around the bottom section, or in a straight line away from it and back to it. This way when you finish the ball you won’t have to carry it a long way to the bottom section.

, Depending on how big you are, have someone help you lift the large ball. Bend your knees and be sure to stand up with your legs rather than your back. Pick it up and gently set it on the bottom section. Make sure that it sits right in the center of the bottom ball.








It helps if you flatten the top side of the bottom ball and flatten the bottom side of the middle ball. This helps the middle section sit firmly on the bottom section.

, Scoop up one last ball of snow for the head. Pack it with your hands until it is about one foot (30.5 cm) wide. You should be able to make the head without rolling it, but it’s okay to roll it if you want to. When you finish, carefully place it on top of the snowman’s body., Once the three sections are in place, scoop up more snow and pack it between each section. This will give the snowman a uniform look from top to bottom, rather than looking like three snowballs piled on top of each other.








, Grab a long raw carrot from the grocery store for the snowman’s nose. Place it in the middle of the top snowball. Make sure you place it so there is room above it for eyes and below it for a mouth.


Making the snowman your own is all about creativity. If you have something else that you think would look cool as a nose, use that instead.

, Place them above the carrot and space them evenly to the right and the left. Push them into the head, and twist them in a circle so that they stick in the snow. Any round object will work for the eyes.

Use yellow ping-pong balls, blue rubber bouncy balls, or large green plastic gems.

, Use the same thing you used for the eyes to make the mouth, or mix it up with other round objects. Place the mouth under the nose, but not too close to the middle section.

Cut a mouth out of felt, stick some fake plastic teeth in the face, or bend a piece of rubber tubing into a smile.

, Find a couple of sticks that are about one inch (2.5 cm) or less wide and around three feet (1 meter) long. Push the sticks into the middle section of the snowman. Position the sticks so they are angled up or down, giving the snowman the look you like best.









Before the arms, if you want, put a shirt or coat of some kind around the body of the snowman.
Also use old broom sticks, golf clubs, or fake skeleton arms!

, This is where you have even more space for creativity. Grab an old ball cap, cowboy hat, fedora, or top hat for the snowman’s head. Wrap a colorful scarf around its neck. Use old stuff that you don’t mind possibly ruining.

Add a tie, sunglasses, or any other accessories to make the snowman stand out from the rest.

Stand back and admire your cat.",How to Make a Snow Cat," As with a snowman, ensure that your snow is not too slushy or icy.;
, Make a large round ball of snow, in the same manner that you would use to build the base of a normal-sized snowman. Build this with a slight angle forwards; while this will form the base of the snow cat, it is also going to serve as the snow cat's back legs, tummy and rump. Make sure that you leave a place on this ball for the next ball to be added on. Let this sit for about 2 hours to solidify.

, The aim is to create little curved upper leg shapes that look like a cat that is sitting down on its rump (see photo next to this step). If it proves too hard to carve these, just build them up from the ground using extra snow. Lean this snow against the base, making sure to mold them into a cat's folded leg shape. Artistic license is encouraged - any shape vaguely like a leg is great.

, Add a slightly smaller ball to the tummy area of the cat. Try to get it to lean slightly forwards (think of a cat sitting and how its body shape curves forwards). Smooth the joints over with additional snow. This is the middle ""chest"" section of the cat. While this chest area should be able to sit on the base without support, the addition of the front legs will provide extra support to this ball, so it helps to have the leg sticks propping up this middle ball if you find the ball not staying on its own.

, Take two equal length sticks and place these so that they angle into the second ball to form the snow cat's front legs. Pile snow around these sticks, from the base up to the ""chest"" of the cat which is the second ball of snow. Continue adding snow until the legs are solid and in proportion with the rest of your snow cat's body. Smooth the joints over with additional snow.

, Make little ""patties"" of snow and stick them at the base of each leg. Use twig strands to make claws; three even-sized twigs for each paw, laid flat at even intervals on the paw will provide an effect of claws. Experiment with curved twigs if you fancy.

, Prepare a smaller ball for the head, in the same manner as you would make a snowman's head. Add to the middle ball and smooth the joins over with additional snow. Shape two little pointy ears out of snow. Try to mold out a little pointy area for the cat's mouth and nose region. Don't worry if this is too difficult, the decorations will ensure the face looks like a cat.

,



Whiskers and mouth: Use fine twigs for the whiskers and the mouth. For some added humor, try adding a little cat's tongue made out of bright red felt poking out of the cat's mouth.







Nose: For the nose, there are many possibilities, including a round nose made from snow; a big black button; a piece of coal; a small pine cone; or anything else you desire.

Eyes: Use buttons; small pine cones; or try the suggestion in ""Tips"" below. If you make a cat with olives for eyes the squirrels might just be desperate enough to pluck them out...

, Poke a stick into the back of the snow cat's base, making it point upwards. As with the legs, coat this stick in snow, working from the base upwards. If the snow falls off, let it solidify stage by stage. If you prefer, you could start the tail once the base of the cat is made and add bits of snow to it here and there as you make the rest of the snow cat. Tie a decorative ribbon about the tip of the tail if you wish. Or try for a kink in the tail - look for an unusually shaped twig and experiment.

, and food coloring (diluted poster paint works, also) into a spray bottle. Have several bottles of different colors on hand.

, Add a scarf if you want kitty to keep warm. Take a photo.

Sew thick, white yarn into a golf practice ball.,
Crumple up sheets of white paper.,
Purchase indoor snowballs from an online retailer.",How to Have an Indoor Snowball Fight1," For this method you’ll need to visit a local yarn store and pick up a couple of skeins of fluffy white yarn. Thread the yarn through two holes, and then tie a large knot in the yarn so the end won’t slip back through the ball. Then, wind the yarn around the ball until you’ve created a roughly tennis-ball-sized “snowball.”To finish off the “snowball,” cut the yarn off of the skein. Using your fingers—or a crochet hook, if you have one—press the end of the yarn into the yarn that’s already wrapped around the golf ball, so that the “snowball” won’t unravel.
A golf practice ball resembles a ping pong ball, but has holes punched in the outer surface. Golf practice balls can be bought inexpensively online, or at a sports equipment store.
If you’re struggling to effectively weave the yarn through the holes in the golf practice ball, purchase a large plastic needle at a local hobby or craft-supply store.;
, This is perhaps the easiest DIY method for constructing indoor “snowballs”—find white sheets of paper and wad them up into snowball sized, roughly spherical objects.If the kids involved in the snowball fight aren’t particular about the “snowballs” actually being white, then you can use any other type of paper that you may have around the house.
Check your recycle bins for newspapers or coupon mailings. Depending on what papers are laying around your home, you could even crumple up old homework assignments, bills, etc.

, If you have time to plan a week or two ahead for your indoor snowball fight, but would like to invest minimal effort into constructing the “snowballs” themselves, consider purchasing a set from an online retailer or from a company like ThinkGeek.Snowballs will be made from a plush, soft material, and typically are about 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) in diameter.


For example, Amazon offers dozens of options for purchasing indoor snowballs. Small packages of 6 start at about $10, while larger packages of 40 sell for about $35.If you live in a region that doesn’t receive much snow during the winter, it’s likely that some retail stores in your area will stock indoor snowballs. Start by checking children’s toy stores (like Toys R Us) and craft supply stores.

Roll up white socks.,
Sew indoor “snowballs” from cut-up athletic socks and polyester fiberfill.,
Stuff your children’s crew socks with soft material.",How to Have an Indoor Snowball Fight2," This is a simple method for making indoor “snowballs”: simply take a white sock and tightly roll it up on itself.If your kids aren’t particular about the color of the “snowballs,” you can use socks of other colors too. Try to use thicker, more padded socks, as these will produce larger “snowballs” and be more fun to throw. Using a pair of thin dress socks or small ankle socks will result in a tiny, flimsy snowball.


The number of socks you’ll need depends on the number of participants in the snowball fight. Plan to provide each participant with about 10 “snowballs” to start the fight.
Younger children may grow bored and need fewer than 10, while older children may need double or triple that amount

, To make this version of an indoor snowball, start by turning the socks inside-out, and then cut two circular sections from the body of the sock. Each section should have a roughly 3-inch (7.6 centimeter) radius. Using a needle and white thread, stitch each of the two circular sections closed, leaving only a small opening on one side. In this opening, stuff a handful of polyester fiberfill, and then sew the opening shut. At this point you’ll have two soft indoor snowballs; repeat as many times as needed.If you’d rather not use socks that you already have around the house—or don’t have enough white socks for a snowball fight—you can purchase socks inexpensively at a local thrift store or dollar store.
The supplies you’ll need for this step—needle and thread, scissors, and fiberfill—can be purchased from a craft-supplies store.

, Take one of your child’s crew socks, and stuff it with any type of soft material that will not hurt someone if thrown at them. You could stuff the crew sock with one or two additional socks, a handful of polyester fiberfill or cotton balls, or crumpled up newspaper.To secure the open end of the sock, simply tie it off with a rubber band.

Move fragile items.,
Divide the participants into teams.,
Give a portion of the snowballs to each team.,
Announce a winning team.",How to Have an Indoor Snowball Fight3," Before beginning the snowball fight, clarify to the children participating that they still need to be respectful of property and avoid playing around breakable items, such as glass cabinet doors or mirrors. You should move smaller fragile items out of the way; put breakable valuables in a cabinet or closet until the fight is over.Hide delicate items including vases, before the snowball fight starts.

, Depending on the ages of the children involved in the snowball fight, it may be most effective to divide the children into two opposing teams. Each team can have a “home base.” For example, one team can start in the kitchen and the other can start in the living room.


If you’re playing with younger children, this may be too complex for them. You could have younger children all start in the same room, and structure the snowball fight as more of a “free-for-all” if they’re confused by the concept of teams.

, If you’re dealing with young children, you could give each team a laundry hamper or clean storage bin full of “snowballs.”Encourage them to throw these “snowballs” at the opposing team or individuals before picking up already-thrown snowballs from the floor.


If the children involved prefer not to play on teams, but would rather each throw snowballs at all of the others, you could provide each child with a smaller amount of snowballs in a bin or hamper.
If you’re facilitating a snowball fight for older children, add an element of strategy by making a rule that participants can only hold two “snowballs” at a time and, after throwing them, must return to hamper full of “snowballs” to pick up two more.

, Once the teams have used up their respective portions of “snowballs” and the fight has run its course, you can conclude the snowball fight by announcing the victorious team as the winner. If you’re playing with younger children who did not form teams, don’t worry about deciding who won or lost—make sure that the kids had fun, and praise everyone for having participated.


Once the game has wrapped up and the children have started to calm down from the excitement, ask all participants to find and pick up all of the “snowballs” that were thrown.
If you store the “snowballs” in a specific location (for example, in a large plastic bag), ask the kids to help you put the “snowballs” away.

Make a tail.,
Add facial features to your snow penguin.,
Take a snapshot of your unique snow sculpture.,
Finished.

",How to Build a Snow Penguin," It's important to make sure that you have the proper snow for snow sculpture. It needs to be firm but not too icy nor slushy. Test it by rolling into a small ball and seeing how the ball forms and stays together. If it forms easily and stays in shape, the snow is good to use.;
, This will form the base of the penguin. When it gets large, it will start to get squared-off on the corners. This is perfectly fine; all imperfections will be fixed later.

, Now repeat the previous step to create another ball of snow, only make this one about two thirds the size of the first one. Arrange this new snowball on top of the base (careful, it's heavy!).

, This one needs to be much smaller than the other two snowballs. In fact, make it about half the size of the second one. It's also important that this one is as round as possible. Place on top to form the penguin's head.

, From this step onward, it becomes a penguin. Grab snow and fill the gaps between the snowballs with this snow, smoothing the stack of snow into a continuous, streamlined surface. Continue adding snow to the spaces between the snowballs until they resemble the typical pear-shape of a penguin's body. Kids will enjoy this step as it's easy and rewarding to keep shaping it.

, Gather snow from around the penguin's base and shape it into two large feet. Place the feet sticking out, one to the right and one to the left of the penguin's front. If you're extra motivated, use your fingers or a stick to form indents between the claws so that they resemble webbed feet.

, Penguins generally keep their wings at their sides, and so will this sculpture. From between the head and the upper-body section, begin to shape a groove that suggests folded wings. Continue to carve out the groove until it is distinct. Pack snow firmly onto the new ""wing"" area, letting each addition set before adding more. Continue to pack lightly until the wings are visibly separate from the body. Repeat on the other side.

, This step requires the lightest touch and the most patience. Gather snow and shape it into a cone-like structure. Pack it tightly in your hands until it feels solid. Carefully press it to the front-bottom of the penguin's head. Holding it there with one hand (lightly), gather snow with the other to pack it against the head and ""glue"" it there. It doesn't matter if the extra snow destroys the round shape of the head; that will be fixed. Carefully add more snow until the beak stays firmly attached. Small beaks are recommended because longer beaks tend to break off easily.


This step can be made somewhat more solid if a stick is used as the support within the beak. To use a stick, find one of a suitable length for a beak, plus extra length to poke into the head of the penguin. Poke the stick into the penguin's head at beak level, then pack snow around the beak, shaping it into a beak shape as you go.

,


Be patient and persistent. The beak is the hardest part of making the snow penguin and it can fall off just when you think you've got it right. Use a very gentle touch when sculpting it and let it set before adding anything else to the head.
If the head has become misshapen at this stage, it will need to be rearranged to restore its roundness. More snow can be added if needed.

, Make another beak-like structure, but larger, and attach it to the back bottom of the penguin's base. If it's easier, just form the tail direct from the back of the penguin's base on the snow.

, Creativity is encouraged here. Feel free to add accessories such as scarves or hats. Add eyes and eyebrows even.

, Congratulations, you've made a snow penguin.

Look where you're going.,
Tread on live grass or bare dirt.,
Walk slowly.,
Map out your steps in advance.,
Walk heel-to-toe, and bend at the knees.,
Try walking sideways, if you need to move quickly.,
Run on the balls of your feet.,
Adjust for visual-aural delay.",How to Walk Quietly in a Forest1," Watch the ground ahead of you very carefully. Try to avoid stepping on obvious sound “landmines” like twigs or fallen bark., Avoid dry grass and foliage, which will crunch underfoot and make noise. Choose the clearest path to walk on – smooth, bare dirt is best. Mossy rocks also muffle the sound of your footsteps., Any time you are trying to be quiet, you should slow your pace and think about each step. Take three or four careful steps, then pause and regroup before continuing. If you rush through your steps, you will be far more likely to accidentally make noise., Instead of spending your entire time in the forest seeing nothing but your feet, try looking ahead and planning where you want to place your next few steps. This way you can keep your head up, and see more of your surroundings., This method is sometimes called “fox walking.” Place the heel of your foot on the path ahead, then gently roll your foot down until the sole touches the ground. Avoid walking “flat-footed,” touching all surfaces of your foot to the ground at the same time – this will produce a much louder sound.Soft-soled shoes or light boots will make the least amount of noise in the forest.
Place your foot down on the outer edge first, then roll the rest of your sole down until it touches the ground.
Slowly shift your weight onto your foot, listening for any crackling or crunching noises. If you hear anything, stop immediately and move your foot to a new position.
Crouch low and bend your knees, then walk slowly and carefully with your body balanced low over your center of gravity.
Walk slowly. Slow your pace and think about each step. Take three or four careful steps, then pause and regroup before continuing.

, Stand with your destination directly to the left of you. Take your right foot and swing it across the front of your left leg and quietly put it down. Then take your left leg and swing it to the left, behind your right leg. You may be able to move quietly and quickly in this fashion., If you need to run in the forest, try to touch only the balls of your feet to the ground. This requires more strength and better balance than normal running, and can be quite tiring if practiced for long periods., When walking with a group, the quietest method is for everyone to walk at the same pace. If you are walking with a friend who is a fair distance ahead of you, you may need to adjust your timing. Because sound travels more slowly than light, you may see their foot touch down ever so slightly before it makes a sound.Pay attention to the length of time that elapses, then use that same amount of time to adjust your own steps – put your own foot down a split second before theirs will touch the ground.
By the time the sound reaches them, it will match the sound their own foot has made.
Boots or shoes with light, flexible soles make the least amount of noise in the forest.

"
"
Try the cat walk.,
Match your partners' pace.,
Wear soft-soled shoes.",How to Walk Quietly in a Forest2," This method is used to stalk animals, allowing the hunter to get very close to his prey without being heard. It is usually only done for brief periods of time, because you will need to move very slowly.When lifting your foot, point your toes at the ground. You will be less likely to snag your foot on foliage as you raise it.
When putting your foot on the ground, connect the outer edge first, then roll the rest of the foot down until the sole touches the ground.

, If you are walking with a partner or a group, everyone should match their walking pace. When they put their left foot down, put your left foot down, and the same with your right. This way, the sound of your footsteps won't stand out over theirs., Native Americans wore soft-soled moccasins while hunting, because it helped muffle foot noises when hunting. Walking barefoot, or in a shoe that allows you to flex your foot, will allow you to feel the surface of the ground more accurately and avoid potential pitfalls like snapping twigs.If you must wear boots, wear the lightest and softest ones possible.
Walking barefoot is the most quiet choice, but is usually too painful over rough terrain for most people.
Kevlar toe socks are the rugged, outdoor version of the flexible running sock that is very similar to going barefoot.

"
"
Breathe quietly.,
Suppress your sneezes.,
Avoid noisy clothing.,
Mask coughing or rustling with background noises.",How to Walk Quietly in a Forest3," Breathe at a steady pace, inhaling and exhaling through the mouth. Forcing air through your nostrils creates more noise than breathing through your mouth.

, If you are trying to walk quietly in a forest, the last thing you want to do is sneeze loudly and give your position away. If you feel an urge to sneeze coming on, there are a few things you can try.Try pressing down hard on your upper lip, just under your nose. Hold your finger there until the urge to sneeze passes.
Hydrate your nose with saline nasal spray before you take your walk – this will prevent sneezes related to dry nasal passages.
Avoid staring directly at sunlight, and wear sunglasses in bright daylight. Sudden exposure to sunlight can trigger a sneeze.

, Check your clothing before you leave the house, to be sure you aren't wearing anything that makes noise. Avoid pants that rustle when you walk, jackets with dangling metal zipper pulls, and backpacks with jangling metal clips or D-rings.

, If you need to cough or rifle through your backpack, try to time this to coincide with other noises around you. A rushing waterfall, an airplane overhead, or a car passing on a road nearby will camouflage small sounds.If you feel a coughing bout coming on, try to hold it until you can mask it with a louder sound – maybe the person you're following will toss their pack to the ground to rest, or you hear a group of riders on horseback approaching down the trail.

If you haven't already, join a group.,
Once you're sure you want to join, let your leader know.,
Get your uniform.,
Learn the ropes.,
When you feel ready, let your leader know that you would like to make your promise.,
Chose a time and place to make your promise.,
Learn your promise.,
Understand the promise.,
Make your promise.,
Feel proud!",How to Get Your Girl Guides Promise Badge," Find a unit near you (you don't want to have to travel miles every week) and speak to their leader about you joining. If they have space, come along for a couple of trial sessions before you decide whether or not you really want to join properly.;
, Then you can just continue coming as you have been already. However, there is a termly fee, usually £15-£25. If you will struggle to pay this though, most units could help you out.

, If you are going to get your promise badge, you need to have uniform. The easiest way is online but check with your leader first as they might have spare stuff in your size just lying about.

, Join a patrol and go regularly to Guides for at least one month before making your promise.

, This will let them know they need to acquire a badge for the event.

, This is a very special time in your journey through guiding so treat it with respect. However do remember to have some fun. Some ideas for places to make your promise are:


In the dark with torches/glowsticks
In a tree in a nearby green space
On a trip (ice-skating, trampolining, etc.)
At camp, around the fire
At camp, on one of the activities (e.g. zipline, top of a sailing tower, etc.)
Be creative with ideas!

, This is possibly the most important step. The promise goes:


I promise that I will do my best: To be true to myself and develop my beliefs, to serve the Queen and my community, to help other people and to keep the Guide Law.

, What is the point of making your promise if you don't understand what you are saying? Go through, line by line, and make sure you understand what it is that you are saying.

, Once at your chosen place, make your promise. The ceremony will probably go something like this:


Your leader will announce to everyone that you are going to make your promise
Either your patrol leader or patrol seconder will lead you over to your leader
Your patrol leader or patrol seconder will say something like ""This is and she would like to join .
They will sit down and you will do the Guides salute (with your right hand, hold up your middle three fingers)
You will recite your promise to the leader
They will salute too and shake your hand, saying something like ""I trust you to keep this promise. Welcome to the worldwide community of Girl Guides""
They will pin your badge onto your uniform and award you with a certificate.

, You have made your girl guides promise and earned your badge.

Examine a footprint.,
Examine the track pattern.,
Look for other track signs to identify the animal.,
Check your findings against a field guide.If you're serious about tracking, go to the library or bookstore and pick up a field guide to the animals that live in your area.",How to Track Animals1," It's exciting to discover a footprint in the mud or snow, a tell-tale sign that another creature has recently crossed the same path you're taking. Every animal has a distinct print, and if you know what to look for, you'll be able to tell what type of animal might be nearby. When you look at a footprint, pay attention to these factors:The size of the print. Right off the bat, you should be able to tell whether the print was likely left by a fox, bear, cat or mouse by the size of the print.

The number of toes. This is a basic feature of footprints that can be very revealing, since different animals have different numbers of toes in their prints. For example, felines like bobcats and cougars have 4 toes on each foot, while weasels and skunks have five.

Whether or not nail prints are visible. Feline prints don't show the nails, but prints left by wolves, raccoons and bears show long claw marks.

Whether the print shows an opposable toe (or thumb). Creatures that can climb trees, like raccoons and opossums, have an opposable digit that enables them to grip the tree as they climb.

Whether the front and back prints are the same size. Dogs, cats, foxes, bears and many other creatures have front and back feet that are exactly the same size. If you see prints that show tiny front feet and large back feet, they were probably left by a rabbit or hare.

Whether the prints were left by a hoofed animal. The print of a deer, moose, elk or another hoofed animals is quite distinct from that left by an animal with paws.;
, The next step is to look at where the footprints fall and try to identify a pattern. You can determine an animal's gait by interpreting the track pattern. Since different animal families have different gaits, examining the track pattern can help you figure out what type of animal tracks you're seeing. You can also use the track pattern to predict where the animal may have gone. Here are the most common track patterns:


Diagonal walker pattern. Diagonal walkers, including felines, canines, and hoofed animals, lift the front and hind legs on opposite sides at the same time. They leave behind staggered tracks. Imagine the way a horse walks or trots and the prints he leaves behind.

Pacer pattern. Wide-bodied animals like bears, beavers, opossums and raccoons lift the front and hind legs on the same side of the body at the same time.

Bounder pattern. Weasels, ferrets and badgers hop so that their front feet land first and their back feet land next. The prints from their back feet will usually be just behind their front prints.

Galloper pattern. Rabbits and hares gallop when they move. They jump so that their front feet land first and their back feet land in front and to the side of where the front feet landed. Since they have long back feet, their prints tend to look like a ""U.""

Hoppers vs. walkers. Bird track patterns tend to fall into two categories: hoppers and walkers. Birds that hop have prints that land adjacent to each other. Birds that walk have offset prints, like those a human makes. Note that hopping birds generally live and feed in trees or in the air, and walking birds generally live closer to the ground and feed on ground-dwelling insects or animals.

, There are many other clues that can help you narrow down exactly which type of animal you're tracking. Examine the prints and track pattern carefully and check for extra details like the following:


How the prints register. Do the back prints fall directly on top of the front prints, making it look as though there is just one set of prints? If so, you're probably tracking a feline or a fox. Do the front and back prints fall in different places, so that you can see all four prints? Canines, weasels, raccoons and bears don't have directly registered walks.
A tail print. You might see a line running through the tracks that indicates the animal's tail swept the ground. A side-sweeping tail print might indicate you're seeing reptile prints.

, Take note of all the clues you gathered about the particular print and track pattern, and see if it matches up with an animal listed in your book. As you learn more about how to distinguish between the different animal families and individual species, you'll eventually be able to identify animals without a guide. For a quick reference, use this table to help you identify common backyard animals.

Look for animal highways.,
Look for for disturbed areas.,
Check the age of animal signs.",How to Track Animals2," Animal highways, or trails, are natural paths found in forests, meadows and other natural environments that are used by many different creatures to get from one spot to another. They look a bit like dirt hiking trails used by humans, except they're usually narrower and less obvious unless you know what you're looking for.Animal runs are paths that connect the trails to the places where they find food, water and cover. Runs are smaller than trails and usually used by just one or two different species.
Look for animal beds, too - places where animals sleep and rest. It may look like a nest, or burrow, with bits of fur and broken foliage.
These places are usually not close to areas developed by humans. Check in areas where forests meet fields and meadows - areas where one type of terrain transitions to another. These are the best spots for animals to find food, water and shelter.

, Animals leave behind clues - ""signs"" - that belie their presence. Look for bare spots on trees where the bark was rubbed off, broken grass and shrubs, chewed plants, and so on. Each animal has its own unique sign to interpret.Pay attention to smells you encounter, too. Skunks and other members of the weasel family usually leave behind a particular odor.
Eventually you'll learn the differences between the bite marks left by different animals. For example, deer rip grass out of the ground, while felines nibble it.
Look carefully for animal scat, or droppings. First, there are big differences in the shape, size and color of different animals' scat. Second, you can tell more about the animal by examining the scat to see what it has been eating.

, If you want to know if an animal is still nearby, you'll need to check the age of the prints and sign. It's difficult to determine exactly when an animal was present, but if you look carefully you'll be able to tell whether a print or sign was left the same day, or many days or weeks ago.

Determine the age of prints by pressing your hand into the ground next to the print. Take a look at the difference. Fresh prints will still have sharp edges around the diameter, while prints that are a few days old will be rounded off. The weather and climate will also have an effect on how long the print stays visible.
Examine chewed and scratched plants. If they were freshly chewed, you might still see moisture there. Leftovers from an older meal might have dried out a little and turned brown around the edges.
Don't expect to see clear traces of an animal. You're more likely to see just a few toe impressions instead of a whole print, or a tiny nick in the bark of a tree. Look carefully for very small clues that indicate the presence of an animal. Where there's one partial print, you're sure to see another one close by, and the next one might give you a better picture of the animal you're tracking.

"

Track in early morning or late afternoon or early evening.,
Use a tracking stick.,
Think like the animal.,
Use your hands to see.",How to Track Animals3," Animal tracks are more visible at these times of day, when the slant of the light makes it easier to see the shadows made by tracks. Tracking when the sun is high in the sky is a lot harder. In addition, many animals are more active in the morning and evening than they are in the middle of the day.


Getting close to the ground and looking at the tracks sideways can also help you see the tiny indents and ridges that indicate an animal walked over a certain spot.
Start where you can clearly see tracks. The easiest way to start tracking an animal is to begin in a spot where you see undeniable tracks, like in freshly fallen snow or in a muddy spot. From there, you can follow the tracks to areas where they're not quite as easy to detect.

, A tracking stick helps you visualize where an animal moved. It's a handy tool to have when you've followed tracks for a bit and they seem to have disappeared into thin air. Make a tracking stick by taking a thin walking stick and fastening a row of rubber bands around the bottom. When you see two tracks, you can measure them by sliding the rubber bands to mark the distance between tracks. Find a missing track by laying the second to last rubber band against the last track you see; the next track should be within range of the end of the stick., When you're tracking an animal, ask why an animal went in a certain direction or took a certain path. Try to understand as much as you can about the animal's intentions so that you can predict where it might have gone. It helps to know a lot about the animal species you're tracking, like what the animal likes to eat, when it's most active, and so on.By looking very carefully at an animal's tracks, you can examine the pressure marks within the individual prints. Note where the animal may have paused, climbed a tree, or started running or flying. Try to understand what might have caused the behavior.
Look for patterns in an animal's tracks that clue you in to a typical day in the animal's life. Most animals are creatures of habit and use the same paths every day.

, Experienced trackers use their sense of touch as much as their sense of sight to figure out which way an animal went. Try tracking while blindfolded to get an even deeper understanding of the animal. Feel the animal's prints and search along the ground with your hands until you find more. Follow them until you understand the way the animal moved through the forest or meadow."

Consider the timing of the peak foliage in autumn.,
Avoid the crowds when you're in pursuit of gorgeous fall colors.,
Check with experts about peak foliage times.,
Log on to the Internet, which provides a quicker means of information about autumn leaves changing.,
Try foliage viewing on cool days with temperatures above freezing.,
Get out of the car to fully enjoy the fall foliage experience.,
Take fall color photos like a professional photographer.,
View fall foliage in the early morning or late afternoon.,
Vary locations for peak foliage in the fall.",How to View Fall Foliage," The fall color season usually runs from late September to mid-October.


Fall foliage is determined by a number of factors, including shorter days, colder nights and the amount of moisture in the ground.
Foliage viewing in some parts of the country may extend into early November.;
,


Head to fall foliage locations during the middle of the week instead of weekends.
Book hotel or bed and breakfast rooms early. Accommodations can be booked up for a year in locations known for the changing autumn leaves.

, Experts can be the locals or forest rangers.


Some rangers function as ""leaf spotters"" or ""leaf peepers"" who send daily or weekly reports for foliage forecasts.
People who really know an area can recommend locations off the beaten path.

,


The U.S. Forest Service maintains a website of fall foliage hot spots in national forests.
Many state forestry and tourism groups also track fall color locations and changes, including those in Maine, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Missouri and Arkansas.
Other foliage viewing reports are available through the Weather Channel and Yankee Foliage.

,


Early frosts can weaken the intensity of peak foliage.
Overcast days, on the other hand, often intensify the fall color.

,

Often the best views aren't by the side of the road.
Autumn also brings different smells and sensations experienced best outdoors.

,


Compose photos by focusing in on a single tree or part of a tree and contrasting it with other objects.
Polarizing filters can enhance color.
If your digital camera has an ""auto white"" balance, go with the daylight setting for exaggerated color.
Use slower film in film cameras for better enlargements. Slide film is best for fall color.
Shoot photos early or late in the day.

,


Early morning foliage viewing can offer vivid colors that contrast with morning mist.
The deep shadows of the late afternoon provide a different type of contrast with autumn leaves.

, Mountains aren't the only place with fall color.


The coast, marshes and valleys can also provide fall foliage viewing opportunities.

This means that to become a member, you need to get in touch with the 4-H office that's nearest to you. There are a number of easy ways to find 4-H branches near you — just a few are listed below:


Use the 4-H website. Visit the official 4-H website (4-h.org) and click on the link at the top of the page that says ""Find a Club."" On the next page, select your state and county to get your local club's office as well as the main state office.Talk to counselors or administrators at your local school, who will probably be a aware of local youth programs.
Use local phone books (yellow pages, etc.);
, At your local or county branch's website (which should be listed on the page if you used the 4-H online office locator), you should find information about 4-H clubs in the area. Once you find a club you'd like to join, reach out! Contact the club to learn about its meeting schedule, its eligibility requirements, and its application process.


Usually, local clubs' contact info is located on the state or county 4-H branch website. Depending on the club, you may need to call, email, or even show up in person to start the application process.

, Before you begin to apply, it's important to make sure you meet the requirements for joining your local club. In general, children from ages five and up may join 4-H and are eligible through the calendar year of their high school graduation.Note, however, that the 4-H programs available to different applicants will vary based on their age.


Note also that precise eligibility requirements can vary from state to state and even club to club. For instance, in Alaska, admission to 4-H requires simply filling out a single-page form and contacting your district agent.However, in California, families must register an online profile with the state 4-H office to enroll their children in 4-H programs., Complete your club's application materials to become a full 4-H member. Many clubs will require you to submit medical release and liability forms as part of your application — if you're a child or teen, you may need to get an adult to help you with these parts. Many clubs will also require a small application and/or insurance fee to begin your membership.Once you're done with the application process, you can start going to 4-H meetings and events! Anyone can be involved in this exciting program! The popular myth that 4-H is only for rural kids is not true — 4-H has clubs in and around urban areas (like, for instance, Los Angeles).Youth of all ages can be members in projects ranging from creative writing to community service, from aerospace projects to raising a goat. The list of projects is endless!

, Depending on your club affiliation, there will usually be dozens of opportunities available to you as soon as you join 4-H. To get the most out of these opportunities, be an active 4-H member: attend your club's meetings, participate in group activities, pitch in for community service projects, and more. Here is just a small sample of programs and activities that 4-H members can potentially participate in:


Science projects (robotics, aerospace, engineering, environmental science, and more)
Civics projects (tours, field trips, leadership summits, and more)Art projects (photography, theater, reading/writing, and more)Community service projects (environmental stewardship, community outreach, activism, and more), The four H's of 4-H (Head, Heart, Hands, and Health) represent the four core pillars that 4-H members should hold in high importance. Members are encouraged to know and display these values both during 4-H activities and during their daily lives. Members are also encouraged to strive to continuously strengthen these values during their time in 4-H and beyond.


4-H members' relationship with the 4-H values is perhaps best summed up in the official 4-H pledge: ""I pledge my head to clearer thinking, my heart to greater loyalty, my hands to larger service, and my health to better living, for my club, my community, my country, and my world."", 4-H members should have a genuine desire to make the world a better place. While many 4-H opportunities can be fun, enriching opportunities for oneself, it's also important to spend time giving back to the community. Most 4-H clubs will offer plenty of opportunities for community service, though 4-H members are also encouraged to be active participants in their community after they become too old for 4-H as well.

, Almost anyone can join 4-H. However, 4-H members, regardless of their ability, should try to improve their minds, bodies, and souls according to the 4-H values. This means getting plenty of exercise, eating right, working hard at school, and taking every opportunity possible to help someone else. By developing these habits of self-improvement early, 4-H members prepare themselves for healthy, full, active lives full of challenges and achievements.


Studies have shown that, on average, 4-H members go on to be better-than-average adults. Young people who joined 4-H have been found to be more politically active, more likely to participate in community service, more likely to excel in academics, and less likely to use alcohol, tobacco, or drugs than young people who don't join 4-H., Your 4-H experience doesn't necessarily need to end when you graduate high school! Adults are always needed in 4-H clubs to be leaders and chaperones for 4-H projects. Share your talents by volunteering to help young people have new experiences, improve their community, and better themselves.


As with joining 4-H as a youth, your first step to volunteering as an adult is to find and contact a local branch you'd like to participate with. If you've previously been an active 4-H member, you can probably simply talk to the current branch leadership, who will already know you. On the other hand, if you're joining for the first time, it's probably best to contact the state or county branch offices.

, Most adult volunteer programs for 4-H will require you to fill out some sort of application form to prove that you are eligible for the position and responsible enough to be trusted in a leadership role. Usually, these are available through the state or county branch websites, though application process can vary depending on your locality, so some in-person action may be required.


For example, to become an adult volunteer in the state of California must first complete an application form along with medical and liability release forms online. Then, the club leader for the club the applicant is applying to must review and confirm the application. Finally, the county office must review the application and either approve or deny the volunteer's application., Many 4-H adult volunteer programs will have some sort of orientation process for new members. These can vary from branch to branch — some may be simple enough to be completed online in an afternoon, while others may require your in-person presence.


For example, in California, volunteer applicants much watch an orientation video (available online), read a volunteer training guide, and attend approximately two hours of in-person group sessions., Depending on your club/branch affiliation, different opportunities may be available to you. You may be asked, for instance, to lead field trips, help organize fundraisers, or supervise community service projects, to name a few possibilities.You may even be asked to design and spearhead projects of your own — it all depends on the 4-H organization you join and the level of commitment you're willing to make!


4-H volunteers are expected to act as role models for the youth under their supervision, so regardless of your exact role, you'll be required to act in accordance with 4-H values to set an example for those around you.
Note that, in some areas, being bilingual can open up many opportunities for you as a volunteer. In California, for instance, 4-H specifically prizes volunteers who can speak Spanish because this skill allows them to be more effective leaders for Spanish-speaking youth, to participate in Hispanic community programs, and to act as translators for other staff."

Go to a park or a beach some place where you'll find nature at its best.,
Find a quiet, peaceful spot.,
Relax.,
Lie down on the grass as soon as you are very comfortable.,
Think about peaceful things.,
Listen to the peaceful sounds.,
Watch the animals.,
Look at the sky.,
You can also take a walk in the park or along the seashore while just absorbing all the wonders nature has to offer you.

,
Once you are done relaxing, you can go back to your mundane chores feeling refreshed.",How to Relax with Nature," If you like oceans, you should relax by the seashore, where you can lie down on the soft sand, hear the sound of the waves, watch the fish swim, and gaze at the little sunlight sparkles dancing on the water.;
, This spot may be under a tree, on the seashore, or any place you think is suitable for relaxation. Relaxing isn't the same when it is too loud where you are relaxing, but the sounds of nature like the leaves, the waves, and any type of nature are very relaxing and beautiful.

, Sit on the grass or on a rock somewhere. Feel it.

, Do not worry about ants or insects climbing over you.

, Think about rivers, mountains, forests and calm, quiet things.

, The rustle of the trees' leaves, the soft splashing of the river, the sound of the waves, the chirping of the birds, and other sounds that you find beautiful.

, You can watch the amazing sights of birds flying, and other sights that you can see in nature.

, If you are going during sunset especially after a hard day's work, just looking at the sky can help you ease a lot of tension. The various patterns the clouds form, the movement of clouds, the bright orange color of the sun when it is just about to set, the various colors of the sky during sunset. The view can be very breathtaking.

,, Remember that whenever you want to relax, spending time with nature is the best thing to do!

Before you shoot the bow, draw it back ten times an hour until you can easily pull back a 40 or 45 pound draw (most state hunting minimums).,
When you are ready to shoot, make sure you have arrows of the correct length (arrow should stick out an inch past the arrow rest at full draw) and grain.,
Draw back, steady your aim, and let the arrow fly.,
The big thing you must do, is draw back and stick your thumb straight out, like your giving someone a thumbs up, and turn it sideways until you can put it behind your neck, then tuck your chin in, as if you were nodding your head, until the tip of your nose on the side nearest to the string actually touches the string.",How to Shoot a Bow Accurately," This is so the arrow has the power to fly a medium distance straight.;
, You must also have the correct field tips. Make sure they are the same grain as the broad tips you wish to use, so when you sight it in practicing with your field tips, it won't be off when you use a broad head to kill what you are hunting.

, Ha! I wish it was that easy, but sadly, it's not. First, you must have your peep sight adjusted. If you are using a compound bow, then you should take to a specialist, because if you mess around with it and cut even the slightest strand of the string that you working on, it will rip apart right away, or it will surely break within the next 5-10 shots. Professionals are trained to detect whether they cut something they shouldn't have before they even draw back.

, Then close the away eye and look through your peep sight and at the pin. Put the end of it over the target and shoot, but hold the bow without moving at all. Except for letting go of the string, of course.

Select the perfect tree.,
Find a comfortable spot.,
Set up a hammock.,
Relax and appreciate the tree.,
Read.,
Write.,
Have a snack.,
Sit in the park.,
Enjoy the trees in the winter.",How to Relax Under a Tree," The location of the tree is up to you, as long as it is somewhere pleasant, peaceful and out of the way of pedestrian traffic. It may be in your backyard, a local park or a place where you enjoy walking. Decide what appeals to you by reason of a tree's shape, color, height, peculiarities, texture, etc. Trees are as individual as we are, making the choice a very personal one.;
, It may be as simple as sitting underneath the tree on a rug or sitting on some soft grass that has been nourished by the shelter of the tree. Perhaps, if you are quite agile, you may enjoy climbing the tree for a view and a position above the rest of the world below.

, Assemble a hammock between two trees in the backyard. Have a wonderful afternoon nap in the fresh air and shade.

, If you are simply going to admire the tree, you can lie back and watch the foliage. Observe how the sun's rays peep through the leaves and be sure to catch the dance of the branches in the breeze.

, Reading under, next to or while in a tree is a pleasant and peaceful pastime. A favorite novel, a new magazine or biography are just some of the possible choices.

, If you enjoy writing, have to study or prepare some written work, it can be more relaxing to attempt these while sitting under a tree enjoying the sounds of nature around you.

, Go outside for a short break. Sitting in the shade having a snack can be a refreshing change of pace.

, Sit on a park bench surrounded by trees. Bring a picnic lunch. Offer a few bread crumbs to the birds and pass the afternoon away.

, On a warm winter's day, lie back on the snow and look up at the branches of a deciduous tree. Get to know the tree very well. Call back again in the summertime to see how the foliage has changed its perspective nature.

Go outside to a place where there are a lot of trees.,
Sit down.,
Be quiet.,
Listen to the sounds.,
Look around.,
Take a deep breath.,
Observe.,
Keep your eyes on the plants and animals.,
When you are done, and you want to go inside, then you can get up and go back in.",How to Notice Nature," You could also go somewhere with a lot of birds, or somewhere that has a lot of natural features to notice, such as flowers, a river, or a view.;
, Sit down on the fresh, lush green and clean grass. Grass is an overlooked part of nature.

, You cannot hear the peaceful sounds of nature if you are being loud yourself.

, One of the best places to go in nature is somewhere with trees, because you can hear the soft, quiet rustle of their lush green leaves. Other sounds that you might hear include the birds, animals and the rustling of a brook. Try to pick out the different sounds without actually looking at first, then check to verify later. This will help you use more than just your visual sense.

, Watch fish in the river and birds flying in the air. Look at the trees' leaves bending over in a swooping bow as the wind brings it downwards, and observe the white, fluffy clouds floating up high in the beautiful sky.

, Breathe the fresh, clean air that the trees helped to bring to the world. Smell the different scents surrounding you, from flowers and freshly mown grass, to the scent or grass moist after rain or the the smell of the ocean.

, Look at the different types of birds, flowers, animals, and trees. There is so much you can see and observe in nature. Try to see parts of nature that you've never noticed before, both small and large.

, Try not to daydream or drift off. Keep looking at the beautiful sights to notice nature.

, And remember, you can go outside and spend time with nature almost anytime you want!

Define adventure for yourself.,
Seek inspiration.,
Imagine.,
Know why you say “no” or “not now.” If you feel that you’ve become “boring” with age, it may be that you crave the comfort of predictability in your hectic life.,
Don’t fear your fear.,
Plan for the unplanned.,
Say “yes.” When presented with an opportunity, seize it.,
Seek support networks.,
Make mistakes.Put your mastery over your fear of failure into action.,
Choose to “swim” when you could “sink.”Don’t give in to your “I knew I couldn’t do it” impulse when things get difficult.,
Celebrate your adventure.,
Get adventurous in you daily life.,
Perform adventurously.,
Travel the world of adventures.,
Put some action in your adventures.",How to Have an Adventure," People tend to think of an adventure as something hazardous or dangerous; if that gives you pause, perhaps think of it as “something enjoyable, unique, and a departure from your routine.”What qualifies as an adventure depends upon you -- your perspectives, desires, experiences, and so on. One man’s adventure may be another’s routine. Don’t worry about how others may define it; if it feels like an adventure to you, it is one.;
, Even if it is up to you to determine your own adventures, examining the adventurous lives of others can help clarify your own goals, desires, and limits.


Read famous real-life adventure books and stories.Examine them not only for the activities described but the transformative experiences of the author/adventurer.
Talk to friends and family. You may gain not only ideas and inspiration but a better appreciation for someone you think you already know so well. Who knows, your dull great uncle Stu may have had some fascinating adventures back in the day.
You’ll find that what others define as an adventure varies as well. Is it base jumping? Visiting a foreign country with a pocket dictionary, no itinerary, and no return flight scheduled? Going to an open mic night and trying your hand at stand-up? Camping out at a national park? Quitting your job? There’s no shame in “borrowing” one of their adventure ideas if it strikes a chord with you.

, What do you dream about? What activities do you do when you fantasize about being able to do whatever you want? Do some adventure brainstorming, and put no limits of practicality or feasibility on your ideas at this point.


Ignore the “be realistic” voice inside your head. That’s part of what keeps you from having adventures.Draw up a “to-try” list. Rank them from most achievable to most challenging if you desire. Mark them off as you attempt them., Mix that with the all-too-common fear of failure and you have a recipe for a non-adventurous life.Do you delay or avoid following your adventurous dreams out of fear of the worst-case scenario? Confront it head on and write up a “worst-case list” for each adventure. Once you’ve written them out, rationally consider just how remote they are.Compare them to your risk of being in a traffic accident on your way to work or getting cancer, if you must.

, Courage is the mastery of fear, not the elimination of it.Fear is part of what makes an adventure an adventure.


Master your fear not only of undertaking an adventure, but of failing at it. You know the saying about the journey being more important than the destination? Well, taking on the challenge of learning to surf is more important, and personally rewarding, than whether or not you can stay on your board and ride in a big wave., Don’t wait for the perfect time to take an adventure, because the perfect time will never come. That’s just an excuse people make for not going.


Do a little less planning than you’re comfortable doing. Pack your suitcase as normal, then force yourself to repack using a suitcase half the size. Go on a drive with no destination in mind and no GPS. Go skydiving without updating your will.
Erase your expectations.Don’t assume you know what will happen when you take a trapeze class or go abroad as a disaster relief volunteer. You’re going to be surprised regardless of how much you think you know about what to expect. Embrace this uncertainty.

, The next time someone asks you to do something that you would reflexively turn down, accept the offer instead.Go to that NASCAR driving experience at the racetrack. Sign up for your community theater’s next musical.


Don’t be ridiculous, however. If someone asks you to help them rob a bank or swap spouses for a month, that may be a little too much adventure. Set boundaries based on any physical limitations or essential responsibilities you may have, but set the bar a little further out than you typically would.

, No one said an adventure has to be a solitary affair. Backpack across South America or go whitewater rafting with a friend.


Join an adventure club. You’ll get ideas and support for your adventures, as well as some beneficial peer pressure to get out and do things.
When you’re out adventuring, do find ways to keep in touch with loved ones.Just because past adventurers had to “go dark” for long stretches doesn’t mean you must. Let them experience a little of the excitement of your adventure, and in turn give you support to keep at it.

, Assume that you will not be a good skier at the start. Don’t be afraid to visit France because you’re sure that those snooty Parisians will scoff at your terrible French. Maybe some of them will, but so what? Muddle through it and keep going ahead with your adventure.

, Do not quit on your adventure because it’s tough -- it’s supposed to be.


If you get booed off the stage at that open mic comedy night, go back the next time and start with a crack on the crowd’s lousy booing technique. (Nobody said this was “How to Do Stand-Up Comedy.”)

, No matter how successful your attempt at bull-riding, be proud of your achievement and enthusiastic in recounting your adventure to others.


Remember, the adventure itself is more important than the result.Line up your next adventure. Don’t rest on your laurels. Strike while the iron is hot. Prepare to hit another item on your “to try” list while still basking in the glow of the last one.
The best way to make the most out of having an adventure is to have another adventure.

, Activities like these might not be worthy of a book or movie, but they can be fun, easy, and a nice change of pace.


Try a new cuisine -- West African, Argentine, Pakistani, some place you've never heard of before.
Redecorate a room in your house with a favorite theme or a bold color palette. A different pastel color on each wall and Care Bears décor in your dining room? That's an adventure!
Go to a haunted house. If you're more adventurous than that, find one where you can stay overnight.
Turn off your phone and go without the internet for a week. Or even a day for that matter. See if you can complete your daily routines without them.

, Getting out of your comfort zone, especially if you have anxiety about being in front of a crowd, is one way to have an adventure.


Sign up for a belly dancing class. Put that thing to use!
Go to an open mic night at a comedy club and get on stage.
Start a garage band and play some gigs. Sure, maybe it didn't work out when you tried it in high school, but why not now? It also gives you a good reason to clean out your garage.
Ask to sing the national anthem at a local sporting event. If your voice is just too terrible to do your country justice, get a couple of friends to join you and put the best singer in front of the mic.

, Near home and on the other side of the planet, countless adventures await.


Take a multi-day train ride in a foreign land. And don't spend the whole trip in your cabin. Get out and experience a different culture.
Visit a distant ancestor's hometown. Southern Italy? Rural China? An Appalachian hideaway in West Virginia? Go and experience some family history and a different world.
Search the internet for the most beautiful photo of a place on earth you can find ... and go there. Print out the picture and compare it to the real thing.

, If trying Korean barbecue or digging up a plastic container of odds and ends doesn't spell adventure to you, take it up a notch.


Go skydiving. Yes, one of the classics, but still quite a rush.
Go cliff-diving. Another common one, but at the very least it means you are at a beautiful beach somewhere.
Train for and enter a triathlon. If this is beyond your physical capability, start smaller. If a 5k run is an adventure for you, go for it and be proud.

After a steep and rather difficult climb of around 14 kilometers (8.7 mi), you reach Ghangaria.,
Trek for another 3 hours to reach the Valley of Flowers.,
Learn the access and flowering times, to help you determine when best to travel:


May: Accessibility to the park starts from the last week of May, fewer flowers but little rain.","How to Reach Valley of Flowers National Park, India"," Choose your method of transportation that will take you in the right direction to reach the park:


Flying: Take a flight up to Dehradun.
Other transportation: Alternatively, you can either take a train, hire a car or take a bus directly to Rishikesh.

, You will need to spend a night either at Dehradun or Rishikesh. You can resume the journey to the part the following day, understanding that it's a full day's journey.

, The ride can take anywhere between 11 to 13 hours. Joshimath is at an elevation of 1,890 meters (6,200.8 ft) above sea level, and has many reasonably priced hotels. Spend the night here, as the park is still some way yet.

, Govindghat is another 21 kilometers (13 mi) away from Joshimath. The arduous 17 kilometers (11 mi) trek to the Valley of Flowers park starts at this point.

, This small village has several small hotels for a night's stay. Ghangaria serves as a base camp for Gurudwara Hemkund Saheb and the Valley of Flowers. However, the route for both these are different and need to be covered on different days.


Note: You cannot stay overnight in the park. The only accommodation available is at the Ghangaria base camp. Plan accordingly, including the six hour return trek to visit the park.

, Gurudwara Hemkund Saheb is a 5 kilometers (3.1 mi) trek from Gangharia.

,
June: More flowers but not in great abundance. Many pilgrims will be taking the available accommodation spaces. The rain will not yet be an issue.
July and August: Many flowers will be blooming through June until mid-July. From mid-July to mid-August, you will see the majority of the flowers, about 650 species in all.September: This is the last chance to visit the park, during its autumn season. Many of the flowers have finished and have gone to seed. The last week of September is the last occasion for taking this trip.
Other months: Snow makes the park inaccessible.;

Think about the beauty around you.,
Notice the seasons.,
Be environmentally-conscious in your purpose.,
Meet new people while walking.,
Get a dog.,
Think of walks as an approach to get rid of problems.,
Take your music with you.",How to Make Walking a More Interesting Experience," Perhaps a beautiful tree you admire or a bed of flowers. If you're creative, this may inspire a work of art, a poem or a story. Or simply admire the beauty for what it is and keep it close to your heart as a source of inspiration.;
, Watch the tree as it changes seasons, see the leaves falling down, observe the buds coming out. If you are lucky enough to see local wildlife, watch to see if they are gathering nuts, making nests, hibernating or playing.

, If you need to buy something - like milk or juice, head for a convenience store within walking distance and think about how you are helping to prevent climate change by leaving the car at home. Think about other walks you can do to help protect the climate, rather than taking the car.

, If you see a neighbor gardening, mowing the lawn or having a drink on the porch, stop and admire the neighbor's garden or just say hello. If the person responds, start a conversation by asking for advice. You might ask ""Where's the best golf course around here?"" Or, ""Do you have a favorite place to buy plants?"" Or even, ""How do you grow such beautiful roses?"" Ask if you can have just one to take home to a spouse or a child. Go the same time the next day and tell the neighbor how pleased the recipient reacted when he/she received the flower.

, Animal shelters are full of puppies and dogs that need homes. Walking the dog a couple of times a day will get you out of the house and their pleasure at smelling things and meeting other dogs and their owners will bring you great joy and a lot of entertainment. Suddenly walking becomes not only interesting but a must!

, If there is something bothering you, go walk and think wisely about the problem you have. The exercise will be good for you and will clear your thoughts and problems. As you walk (and you probably won't even notice the walk), think through all the issues, options and action ideas that you were struggling with indoors. Things will start to become clearer.

, Grab the iPod, the MP3 Player, the old Walkman or just plain sing to yourself. Music and walking were born to go together and make the experience very uplifting. Choose music to match your mood. If you're feeling gloomy, choose music that are more uplifting.

Plan your route first.,
Make it easier on yourself if possible.,
Wear the right shoes.,
Climb up by finding your first foothold.,
Look for more foot- and handholds.,
Cling close to the wall.,
Position your shoe in the space between bricks as you climb.,
Pull yourself up once you reach the upper ledge.",How to Climb a Brick Wall1," Regular climbing techniques will only work if some of the grout between bricks is missing or if bricks are jutting out. Basically, if the wall is perfectly smooth, you're not going to be able to climb it with standard techniques. Look up the wall, and see if you can find enough handholds and toeholds to get you up the wall.Try to visualize your climb up the wall. For instance, point out places you could get a grip or toehold, and visualize using them to actually climb it. Assess whether you can make it or not.You must also have considerable strength in your fingers in order to successfully complete this technique, especially in your fingertips. If you do not think you can support the majority of your body weight using your fingers, you should try another technique.;
, Look for items that jut out vertically to make it easier to climb. For instance, if a pillar of brick juts out, you can wrap yourself around it for better climbing. Similarly, you can use a solid drainpipe to help you climb., The best shoes to wear will be those that allow you to catch edges. For instance, shoes that have a sharp edge can allow you to grip the wall from the side of the shoe as well as the front. In addition, the shoe needs to have good support throughout the sole so that when you grip with your toes, it can support the whole foot.Also, choose shoes that have good traction to help create friction when you need it.

, You need to balance your weight mostly on your feet. Your hands are primarily there for balance. After you find your first foothold, look for handholds to support you as pull yourself up. Step up onto a foot hold, balancing your weight on the friction. Grab a handhold to help pull yourself up.When looking for footholds, pick ones that provide the most contact possible with your foot. In other words, look for the widest spaces and holds.The closer the foothold is to the ground, the easier it will be to pull yourself up. If you pick one that's too high, you'll have a harder time getting off the ground. When looking, try to pick ones that are further down.

, Alternate moving your feet and hands up the wall. As you look for places, don't be afraid to turn your foot to the side to help you get a better hold.With your other hand, grab the next nearest hold that you can reach for comfortably and securely. Find the next hold with your foot. Pull yourself up using both your hand and foot before looking for your next hold.
Make sure to check bricks before placing weight on them. Loose bricks could cause you to tumble. To check one, reach your hand out and jiggle it. If it seems like it might fall out, skip it.

, Putting yourself as close to the wall as possible helps you to keep your balance. It pushes your center of gravity over your feet, making it easier to hang on., To give yourself much needed additional support, bend your legs at the knee and climb along the bricks as you pull yourself up with each fingertip grip. The sharp edge of your shoe sole should be placed into the indentation formed between bricks, even if there are no gaps in the grout there.If you can't get your foot in a space, you can try ""smearing,"" where you basically use friction over cracks to hold your foot. Place your foot flat against the wall to grip into the cracks. Only use this type of hold very quickly as you're moving to a new position., Once both hands reach the mantel on the wall, shift your feet so that they are approximately at the same level. Step off with your dominant foot to propel yourself over the wall.


Make sure that the palms of your hands are flat on the surface before pushing off.
Alternatively, you could swing your dominant leg over the upper edge of the wall and hook the heel of your leg over the side. Use the strength of your arms and dominant leg to swing your body sideways over the top of the wall.

Thin soles let you feel the wall better, improving your technique, while one-piece soles won't rip off in pieces as easily. The shoe should have a well-defined arch to help you dig in your heels. It should also have a soft rubber for the best grip.If you want to learn parkour in a more controlled, safe environment, look for a parkour gym in your area. They'll have coaches on hand to help you learn the techniques.

You can fall or injure your ankles while trying to do parkour., As you reach the wall, push off the ground with your non-dominant leg. You should be close enough to the wall that you can easily hit it with the other leg. In other words, you need to be within a foot or two. Basically, you are trying to push yourself as far up the wall as you can., Immediately as you get to the wall, push your arms up. You need to be ready when you approach the top of the wall to grasp it., Using the ball of your foot, plant your foot on the wall. Use that foot to change your horizontal motion to vertical motion, pushing yourself up the wall.As you do, be sure to lean in towards the wall, as it will keep you moving upwards rather than away from the wall., Using your non-dominant leg, run another step up the wall. Basically, you're still trying to get as far up the wall as you can. All of these steps must be done in quick succession.You can take a third step, but more than three steps is probably pushing it., Grab the top of the wall with both hands. Pull yourself upwards. As you reach the top, push yourself like you're climbing out of the pool. You can then simply push until you can put your foot on the wall and stand up.Alternatively, you can swing a leg up to the side, pushing it over and drop down the other side of the wall.

Decide what type of climbing you will be doing and determine the type of climbing shoes you need.,
Locate a sports goods store with a large selection of climbing shoes.,
Buy a climbing shoe that gives you the desired amount of stability or flexibility in foot placement, provides adequate traction, and matches your budget.

",How to Buy a Climbing Shoe,"


For long climbs that also involve some walking, including face chimneys, cracks, and slabs, you'll need to buy a sturdy conventional climbing shoe with a board last. This is a flexible board that's placed on top of the midsole to make the shoe more stable and rigid. This adds more stability and helps roll the foot up and along after each step. These are generally made of leather or a strong synthetic material, and fit more loosely than other types of climbing shoes to allow for thick climbing socks. This type of climbing shoe can also be used in combination with crampons to add extra traction when climbing in snow or over ice.
Sport climbing shoes are suited for light climbing gym activity at easy to moderate difficulty, but also for face climbing and very limited crack climbing. They are narrower, fit more snugly than the sturdy conventional climbing shoe, and are slip lasted. These climbing shoes are best for beginning rock climbers or those climbing on surfaces that don't require maximum precision of foot placement.
Performance climbing shoes are for advanced rock climbers and can be worn in a climbing gym or outdoors for competitions, overhangs, advanced sports routes, and bouldering. These shoes are typically turned down for maximum performance on overhangs. This style of shoe is not ideal for long multi-pitch climbing, as they are typically snug and can be uncomfortable when worn for long periods of time.;
, You'll need to try on a lot of shoes to find the right fit. It's best to ignore the sizes on the boxes as manufacturers can either use street shoe sizes or climbing shoe sizes, and the different designs affect the way the shoe fits to your foot. An important thing to remember is you don't have to downsize. try on many styles and models and try to find a shoe that is snug but also comfortable on your feet. Also remember some advanced shoes require a short to long break in period before you will be very comfortable in them.


When buying a conventional climbing shoe, make sure to allow enough room for thick climbing socks if you plan on climbing in colder weather. Many climbers chose not to wear socks in their shoes though. Also pay attention to how the shoe fits around your ankle, as this can sometimes chafe and make the whole experience painful. Leather climbing shoes might be more expensive than synthetic, but they're much more durable and offer better protection from the cold. Also note leather shoes can stretch up to a full size while synthetic shoes will not stretch very much. When buying leather, choosing a lined shoe is a good option as it will reduce stretching.
Sport climbing shoes should fit snugly without being painful. Remember to test the traction to see if they will offer you a good grip when climbing.
Performance climbing shoes should be a very tight fit. In fact, it's quite common for these shoes to be painful to wear. However, the tight fit also allows for maximum precision during foot placement, as well as maximum traction. Generally, climbing moccasins are a popular choice among advanced climbers. Make sure that your toes curl up in the front of the shoe and can't wiggle.

, Pull one side under the other to make a half hitch. Repeat so that the rope turns twice around itself. This will eventually be where the carabiner is placed and it keeps the rope from pinching down on your testicles (if you have them). Drop both of the free ends so that they dangle in front of you (probably touching the ground).

, Pass each free end up through the portion of the rope wrapped around your waist. The free ends should now be between your body and your 'belt'.


Place the free ends over your shoulders so that the ends are dangling down in front of your chest, one on each side.

, This is an important step as this is what will tighten your harness. Stand up and squat several times while pulling on the free ends. You should feel it squeeze you between your legs – make sure key parts are not between the rope and your leg.

, This binds the seat in place. Pull the free end towards your front, along your hips.

, Most right-handed people will place the square knot by their front left hip.

, Note that the half hitch must pass around both 'belts' of rope that now exist.

, Make sure that the rope is in a place that it won't interfere with your carabiner during a rappel.

, Now attach your carabiner and happy rappelling.

Do you want the wall inside or outside?
What shapes, features and size do you want your wall to be?
You will also want to begin drawing out the type of wall you want.;
, You must use a structural method of building your wall to support the weight of a climber, and if it is outdoors, to resist wind loads in severe weather.


Post and beam construction. This is the most structurally sound building method. Set 8 inch (20.3 cm) diameter treated poles in the ground about 48 inches (121.9 cm) deep. Fill the holes with ready mixed concrete, or bags of premixed concrete mixed in a wheelbarrow. Bolt 4X6 inch beams horizontally across the posts with 5⁄8 to 3⁄4 inch (1.6 to 1.9 cm) galvanized bolts. Nail or screw 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) plywood sheathing over the beams, and finish with paint or textured paint.
Wood framed, wood covered. This consists of lumber framing members, attached to a ""mud sill"" or framed up from a concrete base. 2X6 inch (nominal) lumber at 16 inch (40.6 cm) centers is suggested, with a 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) exterior plywood sheathing attached with 2 inch (5.1 cm) number 8 wood screws 8 inches (20.3 cm) on center. You will need to attach diagonal bracing solidly anchored to the back of the wall and the earth behind the structure to keep it upright.
Wood framed, stucco covered. Frame the wall the same as the above, then attach wire plaster lath with 1 1⁄4 inch (3.2 cm) roofing nails, 8 inches (20.3 cm) on center. Bed the lath with 1/2 inch (5.1 cm) of masonry cement plaster, scoring this ""coat"" (the scratch coat), so that the finish coat will bond. Apply a masonry cement or synthetic plaster finish coat after the scratchcoat has dried thoroughly.
Concrete block (CMU). Place a concrete footing, a minimum of 8 inches (20.3 cm) thick, 24 inches (61.0 cm) wide, with reinforcing rods, 2 or 3 feet (0.6 or 0.9 m) below grade (ground level). Stick number 5 rebar dowels 16 inches (40.6 cm) on center into the concrete, with 48 inches (121.9 cm) projecting upwards for block cell reinforcement. Lay up your block (8X8X16 inch, typical), filling each cell that has a reinforcing rod with mortar as you go. Add rebar with a 32 inch (81.3 cm) lap so that the rebar is continuous to the top of the wall. Backfill the lower part of the wall, to the normal ground level, and compact. This earth fill at the base will help support your wall from high winds and tipping over.

, Begin to figure your specific cut angles, your framework, joints and other important features of your wall.Decide what kind of effects the elements will have on your wall if it is outside. Will your wall suffer from being rained or snowed on? One way to sustain the life of your wall is to use marine board. This is more expensive but if you live in a rainy area, you will find the board to be well worth it.

, If you enjoy building, this will be the best part. The reality of your wall will slowly come to life through this process.

,, Are you going to have padding such as mattresses or gym pads?

, If the wall is outside, be prepared for your bolts to rust over. If you don’t plan on rearranging holds very often, you will typically not have much to worry about. If you do want to move holds around, it may be difficult unscrew them once they have become rusted. You can also find holds pretty cheap if you hit your local climbing gyms. Many times they replace their old holds and will give you or sell you their old holds at a pretty low price. You may also be able to find holds from manufacturers that are clearing out old styles. Once you get your wall up, you will be excited and can climb whenever you want. There will come a time when you get used to the wall and it’s not as thrilling as it was once before. Keep yourself motivated by adding to the wall and developing new routes. The more challenges you can give yourself, the more apt you are to continue training on your wall.

Be in good shape.,
Take a safety course to learn the best methods of glacier climbing.,
Understand glacial terrain.,
Learn about glacier hazards.,
Practice glacier rescue techniques.,
Be a good compass and map reader.,
Learn to read weather reports.,
Have the right gear.,
Know your chosen glacier.,
Know your teammate.",How to Begin Glacier Climbing," Glacier climbing is a strenuous activity and demands a high level of fitness.;
, The knowledge is essential; glaciers are not your average hike up a hill. There are many dangers present, as well as techniques that you need to be aware of to ease the travel on a glacier.


Glaciers change over the day as the sun impacts them; flows change, strength of ice changes, etc., and it is important to have a solid understanding of these realities.
It is also crucial to know how to use crampons, ice axes, harnesses, and safety ropes.

, Glaciers generally consist of both ice and rocky material. You will need to be proficient at scrambling over the rocky material as well as climbing the ice. This necessitates carrying gear, putting it on, and removing it at various stages.


Understand different types of moraine (i.e., the messed up debris part of the glacier): lateral, medial, and terminal. The moraine can impact your experience quite dramatically. For example, if the moraine contains sand and silt as well as rocks, this can make the surface slippery, and when there has been ice melt and refreeze, there can be a lot of mud as well.
Some countries rate the glaciers according to terrain and difficulty; consult tourist centers or guide books for more information., As part of your initial learning on climbing a glacier, be sure to learn glacier rescue techniques. Some important things to understand about glacier hazards include:


Glaciers have crevasses (i.e., large cracks) and falling down one often means death. Learning to avoid crevasses is the first step; learning to arrest yourself or to help another person when fallen down a crevasse is the next crucial step.
Crevasses are often very difficult to spot because they are hidden under snow.
Snowbridges form across glaciers. Sometimes these can be crossed by humans; other times they will break under the weight. The strength of such snowbridges is weather dependent.
Mill wells are present at lower altitudes. These are the melt water channels and chutes where water runs into. Falling into a mill well can be extremely hazardous as the tendency is to become trapped under the glacier, making rescue highly difficult, if not impossible.
Seracs are large ice towers that can easily become falling blocks of ice as the sun warms them. They are always potentially hazardous and should be passed quickly, without lingering.
Boulders can become loose from anywhere around or on the glacier at any time. Climbing near lateral moraines is most risky because rock falls can occur as a result of warming; try to schedule climbing time near lateral moraines early or late in the day.Glacial streams are full of silt and can behave like quicksand; take great care in crossing them.

, The importance of knowing rescue techniques until they are second nature cannot be overemphasized. Know how to self-arrest with the ice axe, how to use a z-pulley rescue system, etc.

, Glaciers are subject to mountain weather, and therefore are subject to whiteouts. The only sense of direction that you can rely on in a whiteout is your compass and map., There are some days when it is just better to stay off the glaciers. Be aware of upcoming weather before attempting any climbs. Understand the hazards of being caught in a whiteout when a storm descends upon the glacier.

, It is not possible to climb a glacier in your hiking shoes. Many tourists turn up to glacier hikes with the expectation that they can do so. Occasionally this is possible on small roped-off areas provided for tourist amusement, but this gives an unrealistic impression of climbing and still is not guaranteed to be safe. The right gear includes:


Solid climbing boots
Crampons
Helmet (yes, falls and blows to the head happen)
Waterproof jacket (e.g., Gore-Tex)
Gloves (suitable for ice/snow)
Layered clothing for mountain hiking or climbing
Ice axe (for self-arrest, boot axe-belay and ice testing)
Waterproof trousers/snow pants
Thermals, polyprops (layering is important as you can get hot when climbing)
Socks (hiking/climbing, not cotton)
Hat suitable for climbing/balaklava
Sunglasses/goggles for glare and cold protection
First Aid equipment
Ropes (you should know how to use these from your training); z-pulley rescue system
Harness
Gaiters (some prefer the gaiter/thermal/shorts combination, some add gaiters as well as pants - dependent on temperature)
Sunscreen/zinc cream (even if there is no sun, you can still be burnt badly )

, Every glacier has its unique characteristics. Read books about the glaciers you choose to climb; other climbers' experience is invaluable. At the same time, read website information for up-to-date information on the glacier, given the rapid rate at which they change. Such resources as the National Parks sites, local tourist information sites, and hiking or mountaineering club sites provide reliable information.

, How is with you in your claiming process. You have to know his ice and glacier climbing techniques, abilities, attitude and be sure about his equipment. Of course you must have enough harmony between yours according your privies activities.

If it's hot outside and you're planning to be moving around a lot, carry a water bottle so that you can drink water regularly to help keep you adequately hydrated.;
, Whenever the sun comes out and you have a spare moment, grab the list to help you make a decision about the activity you'd like to do. Over time, having this handy and often updated list can help keep you make quick decisions instead of wondering about what to do with those spare moments during great weather; plus, it also allows you to check off new and interesting activities that you'd like to try but can't always recall when the free sunny day arrives.


Stick this list somewhere obvious, such as on the front of your fridge, so that it can be found and updated with ease.
Read through the ideas suggested in the next part, to see if there are any you'd like to add to your list.

, If you want to get the whole gang out at one go, there are some great things you can do together on a sunny day. These include:


Visiting the beach. Go for a swim, walks, check out the rock pools and count boats.
Organise a family game. Get the family out to play a game together outdoors. You might like to play racing games, ball games or hide and seek style games. You could also play team sports, such as rounders, soccer, tennis, etc.
Do some gardening together. Focus on planting lovely things or harvesting rather than weeding––keep it fun. If you don't have a garden of your own, visit a local community garden and help out for a few hours. Or, you can make a mini garden on an old small plate or in a flask top or on a suitable stone. Place it in a sunny part of the garden.
Go cycling together. Have everyone pump up the tires of their bikes, grab their helmets and head off to a safe and enjoyable local ride together.
Get out the paddling pool. Turn on the hose and have water fun. If you live where there are water restrictions, this might not be an option; check first.
Find free outdoor movies. These are often held during summer by libraries, botanical gardens or art groups.

, Whether it's by yourself or with friends, getting out into nature is the ideal way to have fun in the sun. Some examples of things you might like to do include:


Go hiking in a local park, woods or even back country if it's close enough. Get up early if you have to travel an hour or two.
Sit under a tree and enjoy its shade. Bring a picnic lunch, some music and a book. You can make daisy chains while sitting on the grass.
Go to the beach. Surf, swim, take a boat or sit on the sand and make sandcastles.
Go to a park or wildlife reserve. Do some birdwatching or animal observing. Make notes, take photographs and see if you can identify the different birds or animals that you're observing.
Take your dogs for a walk.

, Use the sunny day to do things on your bucket list. This could be anything from skydiving to snorkeling. Some suggestions include:


Try an extreme sport. For example, skydiving, bungee jumping, water skiing, rock climbing, etc.
Visit somewhere you've never been before. This might be in your own city or town, or somewhere you need to drive to or catch public transportation to.
Learn to do something new that requires outdoor instruction. For example, learn to swim, learn to garden, learn to cook outdoors, learn outdoor survival skills, etc.
Play music outdoors. Find an outdoor community piano or take your guitar down to the local park.

, There are foods that are just ideal for enjoying in the sun, such as ice cream, iced desserts, frozen fruit and ice cream cake. You can also some great drinks, such as smoothies, milkshakes, slushies, lassis, etc. Set up a nice place to dine outside and sit around eating, drinking and chatting together while enjoying the sun.


Have a picnic somewhere. Either visit local places or go on a day trip and have a lunch stop somewhere stunning, such as a waterfall, valley view or lake.

For example, you might want to carry a weapon for personal safety because someone has physically threatened you. Depending on your county, this might not be sufficient reason.On your application, go into as much detail as possible, including the following details:dates and times of any incident
the location of the incident
names of police or other authorities involved
copies of police reports or restraining orders
verified statements from witnesses

, In some counties, you’ll submit the application online.In other counties, you’ll submit the application when you attend your interview. Read your county’s instructions to see how you should submit.


You may also need to scan and upload supporting documents, such as your utility bill or birth certificate., After you submit your application, you’ll schedule an interview. To prepare, read the questions in Section 7 of the application and prepare your answers.For example, you’ll be asked whether you have ever been in a mental institution or if you’ve ever been addicted to alcohol or drugs.
You’ll also be asked about any criminal history involving firearms and domestic violence.
Also prepare to talk about why you have good cause for getting a CCW license.

, Typically, you need to pay a portion of your administrative/background check fee at the time of your interview.Refer to the instructions for the amount.


You may also have to pay for your fingerprinting at the interview.

, At your interview, you’ll discuss your criminal history and why you need a license. You’ll also talk about the consequences of publicly carrying a firearm.Arrive at least 15 minutes ahead of time for processing, and remember not to bring any weapons or bags with you.If you can’t make the interview, call the sheriff’s office as soon as possible to reschedule.

, After your interview, you will be told where to go to have your fingerprints taken. The fingerprints will then be sent to the sheriff’s office.Ask if you need to pay when you have your prints taken.

, You should obtain pre-approval before you take the safety course and complete your weapons qualification.Pre-approval will save you time in case you don’t qualify for a license.

, All applicants must take the state’s Firearms Safety Class. The sheriff should have a list of pre-approved courses you can take. Generally, you will take a 16 hour course on firearm safety or a 24-hour community college course., You can get a CCW license for more than one weapon. The county will set the maximum. Before approval, you must show that you can safely handle your weapons. Arrive at the firing range with all weapons you intend to qualify and make sure they are not loaded.You must fire your weapon at the range and pass with a score of 70% or better.
For example, you will shoot at two targets from the “low ready” position at the 15-, 10-, and 7-yard lines.
Your holsters will be checked to make sure they have an acceptable thumb snap.

, Your county may require that you complete psychological testing before they award you a CCW license. If testing is required, you should be referred to a licensed psychologist.You’ll have to pay for the testing, but it shouldn’t be more than $150.

, The sheriff’s office will analyze your application after you submit it. The processing time differs depending on the county. However, you could be in for a long wait.


In Placer County, for example, applicants generally wait six months or more for their applications to be processed.Contact your county sheriff’s office to check on wait times.

, You paid a portion (usually 20%) when you submitted your application. Typically, you’ll pay the remaining 80% when you receive your CCW license., If you move within the same county, notify the sheriff’s office of your new address. Don’t delay. State law requires that you provide written notice within 10 days. You may also have to complete a modification form and go into the office to have your license updated.If you move outside the issuing county, then tell them you have moved. You may have to surrender your license, depending on the circumstances., Don’t wait for your license to expire before renewing. You’ll be breaking the law if you continue to carry with an expired license. Submit your renewal application 30-45 days before the expiration to give yourself enough time.You’ll need to take a four-hour CCW renewal course.Check with your county sheriff for a full list of requirements.

This is not true of long guns (shotguns, rifles, etc.).New Jersey is one of the most difficult states to acquire a conceal carry pistol permit in the US., You must contact the police branch that covers the area you live in. If you nearest police office is a branch of the State Police, call ahead of time to make sure they cover your municipality.


While you have them, ask specifically what forms and payment you'll need to bring with you. While most of them are identical, different police departments may have slightly different procedures. It is best to ask in advance.

, If you do not already possess these documents, you must go through the process of applying, as outlined above.


You should purchase the handgun you intend to carry with these forms ahead of time. You will need to provide the serial number, make, and model of your handgun on your application., Each state's laws about handguns, especially those concealed in public places, is different. You need to know the laws and protections set out by the state before applying to ensure that you fill out everything correctly.


You need 3 reputable character witnesses, who have known you for at least 3 years and are willing to testify that you have ""sound moral character.""
You need ""justifiable evidence"" that you need to carry a handgun for your own personal safety. This is either because of living conditions or your line of work.
You need evidence (courses, training, demonstrable knowledge) that you know how to own and operate a pistol safely., You can pick these up at State Police offices or at you local police outfit. You'll need to make a copy as well, as you should turn in two identical permits applications.


.

, You should always call your local police station ahead of time to see what sorts of tests will be accepted. There are several ways to prove that you are comfortable and familiar with handguns, including:


Evidence of courses taken at a firing range, through an NRA-certified instructor, or self-defense classes taken through a local police unit.
Scores from a qualified Handgun Qualification Test, administered by the New Jersey Police Force.
Completion of any other test or course certified by the Police Training Commission.<reF.http://smartgunlaws.org/concealed-weapons-permitting-in-new-jersey/#identifier_10_5381</reF>

, This is perhaps the biggest hurdle to getting a handgun permit. You should write, in detail, your reasons for needing a handgun on your person. You need to prove that you need a gun for personal safety, and that your life is in danger without one. While what is acceptable and what isn't is generally up to whoever reads your application, common reasons include:


Working in security or transport of valuable goods that have the potential to be stolen.
Urgent necessity for personal protection, as shown by life-threatening incidents., These three people need to sign the statements on the second page of your Permit to Carry a Handgun. All it requires is their name, signature, and basic contact information. These three people must:


Be older than 18.
Have known you for three years or more.
Willing to talk to the police in the case of an inquiry., You can take these yourself, but make sure they are well lit with a plain background. You'll need to capture your shoulders and your whole head, which should be large and centered in the photo. They should be at least 2-inches by 2-inches.


You can also have passport photos taken at your local post office., On the application, you'll need to write down the exact information of the gun you plan to carry.

, Make sure you have copies of everything that are clear and legible. Include copies of your justifiable need statement and evidence of handgun literacy as well, and keep a copy of everything in your records.

, This is the fee required to process your account. You will likely need more money if you still need to be fingerprinted.

, You will be fingerprinted if you are not doing this in concert with your Firearms Purchaser ID card application, which means an additional $60 fingerprinting charge."

Distinguish between the two basic styles of shotgun shell.,
Buy shells that match the gauge size of your shotgun.,
Determine the length of the shells you're considering.,
Learn the shot number.,
Learn the slug sizing.,
Use birdshot for target shooting.,
Determine the size of your target.,
Test different sizes to determine what's best for your purposes.,
Learn the basic types of choke.,
Determine the shot pattern appropriate to your purposes.,
Determine your optimum choke-shot combination.",How to Choose Shotgun Shells and Chokes," From a shotgun, you can either fire ""shot"" or ""slugs."" Shot shells are plastic cartridges filled with tiny metal pellets and should always be fired from non-rifled shotgun barrels. Slugs are essentially a single, fairly large metal bullet loaded in a plastic cartridge.


The kind of shot used in shot shells also varies and it is important to understand the way shot is sized. Birdshot contains smaller pellets for use on smaller animals or targets, while buckshot rounds are filled with larger pellets for use on larger animals or targets.
Slugs are available in rifled varieties, for use in smooth-bore barrels, and ""sabot"" varieties, for use in rifled barrels.;
, Shotguns come in many different gauges, and the ammunition will correspond to that gauge. You must use 12 gauge ammunition for a 12 gauge shotgun, 20 gauge for a 20 gauge, etc.


A 20 gauge shell will fit in a 12 gauge gun, slide about halfway down the barrel and stick if you try to fire it. This can be very dangerous, so it's critical to make sure you buy the appropriate size of shell, regardless of style.

, Longer shells contain more powder and more shot per shell, or a larger slug. The standard shotgun chamber size is 2 3/4 inches for all gauge shotguns. Some shotguns have a 3 inch chamber. Shotguns are known to favor different loads and different shot, so experimenting with various combinations in search of a good match can be useful. 12 gauge shot shells are the most common shotgun shells sold, and are typically available in three different shell lengths:


Regular shells are 2 3/4"" long - safely fired in a shotgun with a 2 3/4"" or 3"" chamber
Magnum shells are 3"" - safely fired in a shotgun with a 3"" chamber
Super-magnum shells are 3 1/2""


Make sure that the chamber of your shotgun is as long or longer than the shells you choose. Do not use 3"" or 3 1/2"" shells in a 2 3/4"" chamber or 3 1/2"" shells in a 3"" chamber.

, The shot number will be printed on boxes of ammunition and refers to the size of the individual pellets in the shell. Larger shot numbers mean smaller pellets.The diameter of birdshot is equal to .17"" minus the shot number. So, #4 shot is .13"" in diameter. While it isn't necessarily important to know the exact size of the pellets, it's important to understand whether you're getting larger or smaller shot if you're planning on hunting.
Buckshot is somewhat more complicated. Available in increments of zeroes, buckshot is usually referred to as ""ought."" 000 is called ""triple-ought,"" and this buckshot is .36"" in diameter, while double-ought is .33"". To complicate matters, buckshot is also available in #4 sizing, which is .24"" in diameter.

, Slug power is determined in the same way as buckshot, with standard, magnum, and super-magnum loadings. With magnum and super-magnum are often loaded with heavier slugs.


The ""rifled"" slug, used in smooth-bore shotguns, has rifling or ribs on the slug. These ribs are designed to prevent damage to the gun if fired through a barrel with a choke.
A sabot is a covering for an object which is smaller than the bore of which it travels through. Sabot slugs ""wear"" a plastic jacket that is discarded after they leave the barrel and are generally more accurate than ""rifled"" slugs, though they require a rifled barrel to be fired accurately.

, It would be unnecessary and foolish to practice your sport shooting at clay pigeons with expensive steel super-magnum-sized buckshot or slugs when regular birdshot is more than sufficient. As a general rule of thumb, always use the smallest ammunition that gets the job done, whether for hunting or sport shooting.

, Larger shot penetrates more effectively, so it is generally used on larger animals. Smaller shot is sufficient for smaller game.


Small game like birds and ground varmint can be taken with shot as small at #8. Alternatively, some hunters like to use larger shot because it can kill at slightly longer range and reduces the number of pellets you have to remove from your food.
Larger animals such as pheasants, turkeys, or rabbits should be taken with slightly larger shot such as #6 or #4.
The largest animals are suited for buckshot. Deer and coyotes should be shot with pellets no smaller than #4 buckshot.
Slugs are generally only used for home defense, tactical uses, and large game hunting. If you're hunting deer-sized game, coyote, possibly bear, etc., you're going to want to use slugs.

, Shoot one of your shot shells at a piece of paper big enough to record the impact of all, or nearly all, of the pellets at the range you expect to use the load. At 40 yards (36.6 m), expect to get a pattern with a diameter of roughly 20-40"", depending on the size of the shotgun shell used.


Examine the pattern. How big is the main cluster of holes? Will it be hard to hit a moving target with the pattern? How dense is the pattern in this main cluster? Will enough pellets hit the target to kill/break it? Is the pattern uniform? Are there large holes in the pattern where targets could escape?
For slugs, shoot between three and five shot groups at paper at a reasonable range; say 50 yards (45.7 m) for rifled slugs, 100 yards (91.4 m) for sabot slugs. Both types of slugs are fairly low velocity, and thus have rainbow-shaped trajectories that are not helpful to long-range shooting. Pick a slug which produces acceptable patterns and satisfies your desire for target damage.

, Most chokes anymore are interchangeable because the inside of the end of modern barrels is threaded, so chokes can be screwed in and out at will. Generally, the following chokes are the most common:


Cylinder bore, which has no restriction, throws open but very uniform patterns. This is useful for close-range shooting.
Skeet choke is appropriate for sport and target shooting.
Full choke has a lot of restriction and throws very tight patterns when fed quality shot. However, when fed soft lead, a full choke tends to shoot uneven patterns.

, The pattern of the shot refers to how much the load spreads out during flight. The pattern changes depending upon the existence of a choke in the barrel. The tighter the choke, the more the lead will be affected. The more lead in a shotgun load, the more serious this effect is.


Largely, this will depend upon your practice and your shooting style. If you're a very accurate shooter with hunting ambitions, a narrower choke might be appropriate to narrow the shot and ensure a clean kill. If you're a novice, a choke is probably unnecessary.

, Practice with different shot sizes, lengths, and combinations of different chokes with your shotgun. With a properly-sighted shotgun, track your shot patterns and accuracy to determine the best combination for your purposes.


If your patterns are the wrong size or don't have the density required to kill game, use a tighter or looser choke accordingly.
If your patterns are uneven, you are probably trying to push too much soft lead through too small a hole. Sometimes less lead and a looser choke will actually allow you to be effective at longer range.

Get the right equipment.,
Be aware of safety.,
Decide whether you want to boulder indoors or outdoors.,
Warm up and stretch.,
Understand how the difficulty levels work.",How to Boulder1," If climbing outdoors, you will need a helmet. Purchase a good pair of climbing shoes from a local outdoor sporting goods store. Ask a knowledgeable sales assistant to help you, good fitting shoes are extremely important so ask someone who knows what they are doing. A pair of these can range from $40 to $200.


As a rule of thumb they should be very snug. Almost too snug. As you progress you will want them tighter and tighter to give yourself more toe control while climbing. Grab yourself some Climber's chalk (magnesium carbonate) on the way out. This will help you dry the sweat on your hands when you climb and keep you from slipping.






You can get all different types and colors but you really only need to stick to whatever is cheapest for right now. It's usually about $1.50-2.00 for a block.;
, Bouldering is done at heights below four meters and involves the use of a crash pad. However, this can develop a false sense of security. A four meter jump can incur severe ankle fractures. In addition, you can hit your knees on protruding rock as you fall. This runs the risk of kneecap dislocation. These injuries can take months to heal. You do not want to jump down. Instead, down climb using both hands and feet.


Bouldering does not involve the use of a rope, so you can expect to fall a lot when practicing difficult problems. Even though you are not falling from a great height, you will often fall suddenly or awkwardly, so it's important to have a crash pad beneath you at all times.
If you absolutely must jump down, land in an upright position with your knees bent (to absorb impact), rolling to the side if necessary. Remove any rings or jewelry before you climb and always have someone to spot you -- that is, someone who is ready to break your fall, guide you onto the crash pad and protect your head from injury.

, Bouldering can be done outdoors on any kind of rock or cliff face, or indoors at a rock climbing gym. Both provide a fun, engaging climbing experience -- so which one you choose is a matter of personal preference.

Outdoor bouldering has the benefit of being out in the fresh air and provides a more natural climbing experience, which some people prefer. However, it is dependent on good weather conditions and requires you to have your own equipment -- such as a helmet, shoes, and a crash pad. You must wear a helmet when climbing outdoors. Rocks can fall without warning off the cliff, tumbling onto the climber and partner below. As a climber, if you see a rock or piece of equipment falling, yell, ""Rock!"" loudly to warn your partner of incoming objects.






Indoor bouldering is a good choice for beginners who want to try their hand at something new without investing in gear (shoes can be rented and crash pads are provided) and for experienced climbers who wish to hone their bouldering skills further. The problems are laid out on colorful walls and can be adjusted to mimic an outdoor climbing experience, across a wide range of difficulties. Indoor bouldering is unaffected by weather, but space is usually limited and the walls can get crowded.







, Bouldering is an intense physical activity, which requires power and flexibility. And like any physical activity, it's important to warm up and stretch before you get started, to help you avoid injury.

Get the blood flowing by doing a few minutes of cardio before you boulder -- this warns the body that it's about to climb. Try jogging or cycling for ten minutes or doing five minutes of skipping. If you're climbing outdoors, the walk or hike to the bouldering spot will probably do the trick!






Next do some stretches to loosen your muscles, joints and tendons. Concentrate on your upper body by stretching your fingers, wrists, elbows, shoulders, neck and back, but also remember to stretch your legs, hips and ankles.






Finally, start out climbing by picking some easy problems that you are confident that you can complete -- this gets your body used to the movements and helps you to slowly ease into the climbing session.







, Most climbing locations -- both indoors and outdoors -- use the same grading system for marking the difficulty of each problem (this is the bouldering term for route, in case you didn't know!)


This grading system is known as the v-scale, and helps climbers to identify problems suited to their level of ability. The v-scale runs from V0 (the easiest) to V15 (the hardest).
In addition, each grade can have a minus, normal or plus value, which indicates difficulty level within each grade. For example, a V0- is the very easiest problem a climber can do, while a V17 is the very hardest.
To help you follow the correct route, all of the holds in a problem are marked with the same colored tape, or in some cases the holds themselves will be coordinated by color. While bouldering, you are not supposed to use any holds that are not part of your chosen problem -- the color system is there to help you avoid doing this.







"
"
Pick a problem and visualize your path.,
Use your legs as much as possible.,
Use the correct hand holds.,
Use the correct foot positions.,
Learn how to fall correctly.",How to Boulder2," Before you begin, pick a problem suited to your ability. If you have never bouldered before, start with the very easiest problem and work you're way up. With practice, you can progress very quickly in bouldering, at least initially.


One of the major mistakes beginners make is to just jump on the wall and start climbing, without planning their route. This quickly leads to getting stuck or falling from the wall.
It's important to understand that bouldering is as much a mental exercise as a physical one -- before you start climbing you need to examine the route and visualize the pat you are going to take.
Think about which holds you are going to use and in what order, think about the specific hand grabs and foot positions you will use, and think about how you can complete the problem as efficiently as possible. This is why it's called a problem -- it's something you need to use your brain to figure out!
Of course, some things things won't go as planned once you're on the wall -- a hold won't feel quite like you expected it to, or you won't be able to stretch quite as far as you thought -- so don't be afraid to improvise when your up there. Just stay calm and find a new route.

, Many people new to bouldering believe that a climber's most important physical asset is their upper body strength, but this is incorrect.


A good climber relies far more on their legs, which makes sense if you think about it.Your quadriceps are some of the largest, strongest muscles in your body, so it makes far more sense to utilize them than your comparatively puny biceps. Is it easier to do a pull up or a squat?
Keep the majority of your weight on your legs and use them to push yourself up as you move from hold to hold. Remember -- power and stability come from your legs. Your arms, on the other hand, should be used mainly for balance and for pulling yourself up as you push with your legs. Try to keep your arms as straight as possible as you climb -- this puts the load on your bones rather than your muscles., As a beginners climber, it's okay to grab the holds in whichever way feels most natural and comfortable for you. But as you progress, you'll need to learn how to use the hand holds in a specific way, using the correct finger and hand positioning, in order to tackle more advanced problems.


Crimping: Crimping is a method of grabbing an edge (a narrow, horizontal hold) or a sidepull (a vertical or diagonal edge) with your fingertips. Your fingertips should rest flat against the edge with your fingers arched over them. This is a fairly solid grip, but requires good finger strength.







Pinching: Pinching is a method of grabbing hand holds that protrude from the rock by pinching them between the thumb on one side and the fingers on the other. It can also be used when there are side-by-side pockets in the rock -- in this case the hold is similar to the finger position when holding a bowling ball.







Palming: Palming is a method used when there are no actual hand holds to grip onto, just the flat face of the wall or rock. You simply press your open hand against the wall, with your fingers together and the weight concentrated in the heel of your hand. Palming allows you to change foot position while your body weight is pressed into your palm. , A lot of first time boulderers tend to focus all of their concentration on their hands and neglect their feet, but foot position is extremely important for balance and stability. Some of the most common foot movements in bouldering include:


Toeing and edging: In bouldering, you will rarely have a hold large enough to accommodate your entire foot securely, so you need to get used to using individual parts of your feet. Toeing, as the name suggests, is when you grip a small hold with just your toes. This is where those tight shoes come in handy, as they will give you a better grip in small surfaces. In edging, you use either side of your foot to stand on small ledge-like holds.







Smearing: Smearing is a technique used when there is no clearly defined foothold. It involves pressing your foot (usually the ball) against a rough, sloping surface and pressing your weight into it as much as possible. Smearing can feel a little precarious, but as long as you stay relaxed and commit to the move fully.







Swapping feet: Another foot movement that's necessary for more advanced bouldering is swapping your feet. This is necessary when there is no room on a given hold for both of your feet and you need to replace one with the other in order to progress with the problem. There are two methods of achieving this: you can simply hop from one foot to the other, moving the necessary foot onto the hold while the other one is airborne, or you can slowly slide one foot one foot on to the hold while simultaneously sliding the other foot off., Falling is an inevitable part of bouldering -- whether it's an accidental fall after a failed grab or an intentional one from the top of a completed problem. Therefore, it's important to learn how to fall properly, to minimize the risk of injury.


If you're climbing outdoors with the use of a crash pad, try to predict the trajectory of your fall before you attempt the problem and position the crash pad accordingly. Don't push the crash pad right up against the rock wall -- you're far more likely to fall out from the wall than straight downwards.
Get into the habit of landing upright, bending your knees to absorb the shock and rolling sideways if necessary. Don't rely on the mat to absorb the impact of your fall, even in the climbing gym, as landing awkwardly could result in an injury, no matter how soft the landing.
If you're jumping from the top of a problem, remember to spot your landing first and make sure there's nobody directly underneath you that you could land on.
As a beginner, stay away from highballing (this is a bouldering term for climbing higher, riskier problems) Falling from a greater height significantly increases your chances of injury. Stick to lower, more horizontal problems and focus on improving your technique.

"
"
Focus on your strengths but don't neglect your weaknesses.,
Try not to get frustrated.,
Watch other climbers.,
Work on your balance.,
Don't forget to rest.",How to Boulder3," The great thing about bouldering is that each person will tackle the same problem in a different way, according to their personal strengths.


In fact, bouldering is one of the few sports where men and women can complete on an even footing, as things like flexibility and balance are just as important as physical strength. Try to figure out what your greatest strength is and use it in your bouldering.
However, as you progress with your climbing, it is also important to spend time working on your weaknesses, otherwise your overall performance will be affected. Avoid only sticking to problems that suit you and try to challenge yourself every once in a while.

, If you just can't seem to complete a particular problem, it's easy to become frustrated and resort to throwing yourself at it or just giving up altogether.


However, both of these approaches are unlikely to help you improve -- remember that bouldering is just as much a mental activity as a physical one. Therefore, it's important to take a deep breath, stay calm and take all the time you need.
Examine the problem again and try to figure out if there's a hand hold or foot hold you might have missed, or an alternative way of tackling the problem.
It's also important to realize that failure is a part of bouldering -- reaching your physical and mental limit is all part of the fun. If you were able to complete every problem on your first try bouldering would get boring pretty quickly.

, Watching more experienced climbers tackle a tough bouldering problem can be a great way to learn new skills and help you to understand some of the best ways to approach specific moves.


You'll also find that most climbers are happy to offer advice and guidance on how to complete a problem that you've been struggling with, so don't be afraid to ask!
However, you should also bear in mind that everyone approaches bouldering problems differently. There is never a single ""correct"" method of doing something, so what works for another person may not work for you.

, Arguably, balance is the single most important factor in being a good boulderer.


You should be aware of your center of gravity at all times and shift your weight when necessary in order to maintain your equilibrium. Try to move in slow, controlled, flowing movements, keeping your weight centered on both legs as much as possible.
Avoid what is known in the climbing world as ""sewing machine leg"" -- where one leg shakes uncontrollably as it bears your entire weight, while the other scrambles for a hold. When this happens, it's an indication that you need to pay closer attention to body positioning.

, Once you get bitten by the bouldering bug, you'll probably want to hit the climbing gym everyday, but this is a recipe for a strained muscle or a pulled tendon.


Bouldering is a strenuous activity and your body needs time to recover between sessions -- at least 48 hours if the session was particularly intense.Always remember to stretch after a bouldering session -- this will help to minimize muscle stiffness and pain the following day.

You may not want to eat snow if you live in an area with heavy smog or other local pollutants, and you should always steer clear of snow that is colored yellow, brown, pink, or any other color than pure white., Fill spray bottles with water and food coloring to write or draw with colors in the snow. Spell your name, make a tic-tac-toe board, or just create beautiful designs., Check out your favorite park or trail—or just your own block—to see how different it looks in the snow, spot all the footprints and animal tracks you can see, and find the best snowman in the neighborhood., Line the railing of a deck or patio with birdseed, or coat pinecones in peanut butter and then roll them in birdseed.

Determine if the sledding space is safe.,
Choose a slight slope.,
Avoid crowded hills.,
Avoid icy conditions.,
Check for proper visibility.",How to Keep Kids Safe when Sledding1," One of the most important things you can do to keep your kids safe is to make sure the hill where they are sledding is safe. The hill shouldn’t have any kind of obstacle on it. Obstacles are dangerous, not fun things for the kids to dodge. Running into trees, fences, boulders, and other things in the sled path is a common way kids get injured.Check out potential sledding areas before it snows. Pick out the area ahead of time so you know what is under the snow, like rocks, bumps, open water, roads, and other obstacles.Avoid snow ramps. When sleds fly through the air, they can become uncontrollable. Children have died after hitting snow ramps, losing control of their sleds, and landing on their head and back.;
, Not all slopes are safe for kids. Though a steep slope may seem like an exciting ride for your kids, it can also be extremely dangerous. Make sure the slope is no steeper than 30 degrees.The slope should have a couple of inches of snow on it for your children to be able to sled down it.Make sure the hill is safely away from busy roads.
Make sure the bottom is flat so there is some place for your children to reduce speed and stop. There should be ample space between the end of the hill and any dangerous obstacles like roads, ponds, and trees.

, When you take your kids sledding, make sure the hill is not crowded with other people. This can cause unsafe conditions. You increase the risk of collision if you sled on busy hills., You should only let your children sled when there is snow on the ground. Never let them sled in icy conditions. Ice is a lot harder and sharper, so it can cause injury. Additionally, ice can cause sleds to go faster and be harder to control, which can be dangerous.Check under the snow to make sure there is not a layer of ice beneath it.

, You should only let your children sled during good visibility conditions. This means not letting them sled at night or when light is too low to see where they are going. If you go sledding at night, make sure there is plenty of light.You should also keep them indoors if there is dense snow coming down.Make sure that you can see more than six feet in front of you. If you can’t, don’t let your children sled.

Go sledding or tubing.,
Have a snowball fight.,
Try snowshoeing.",How to Have Fun in the Snow1," One of the most popular wintertime activities is sledding and snow tubing. This activity is fun and easy, as you need little to no experience to begin. Find a good hill in your neighborhood and grab a tube or sled for hours of entertainment for the whole family. Sledding is fun for all ages, but young children should ride with a parent or older sibling for safety precautions.


Sleds and snow tubes are usually affordable and can be purchased at most big box stores (Walmart, Target, etc.).You can use materials found in most homes as makeshift sleds and tubes (garbage can lids, boxes, kiddie pools, etc.).;
, Snowball fights are a great way to have some winter fun in your own backyard. Get a group of friends together, or make it a family battle. To make a snowball, grab a handful of snow and pack it together to create the shape of a ball.


Make a game of Tag more interesting by incorporating a snowball fight. Whoever is ""it"" must tag people by hitting them with snowballs.
Play a game of dodgeball with snowballs instead of bouncy balls.
Avoid injuries by making sure the snow isn't too icy and not throwing your snowballs too hard. Remember, this should be fun, not painful., If you enjoy hiking during the warmer months, you'll love snowshoeing. Snowshoes will allow you to walk through deep snow without getting stuck, and snowshoers usually hold a pole in each hand to help them keep their balance (the poles are optional depending on the trail and your balance). Outdoor retailers sell snowshoes and poles for kids as young as 2 years old."

Do some homework.",How to Have Fun Inside on a Snow Day (Teen Girls)," Take a warm shower. Keep towels and a robe nearby. When you are finished with your shower, dry off in it and put on your robe. Put oil-free moisturizer all over your face and neck and lotion on your whole body. Try a scent like vanilla if you want a smell to it. Apply a light foundation, powder, if you want makeup on. No matter what you choose to do, apply plenty of lip balm!;
, You should layer, but not excessively, as you'll be staying inside. Put on a camisole or a tank top underneath a sweater or long sleeve shirt. If you aren't too terribly cold, wear a short sleeve shirt. Put on a warm sweatshirt with fur or fleece inside. Put on some jeans or warm sweatpants. If you want, you could even wear pajama pants. Wear a pair of fuzzy socks, and you are good to go!

, Soak your hands and feet in hot water for 10 minutes. Pat damp, and apply a nice foot lotion. Remove old nail polish, and trim all your nails (even ones you are not painting). Put on some lotion (see tips for extra moisture tips). Apply a clear base coat. Paint a soft color like beige or tan, or a French manicure/pedicure. Let dry. Apply clear topcoat.

, This is a basic idea, but mix it up; watch the corniest movies you own, watch movies you loved when you were younger, watch old Disney flicks (i.e., The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Anastasia), romances, horror, chick flicks, or comedy. Pop some popcorn, add all the butter you want, drink a mug of hot chocolate, and enjoy the film!

, If you like to read, try this. If you have a fireplace or a favorite room, curl up near it in a cozy chair (or pile of pillows), and read. Have some hot cocoa while you read. If you have to do school reading, you can get it done this way also.

, Try the websites under tips. Try to find new websites, online diaries, advice websites, teen magazine websites (like Seventeen), or even just here on wikiHow.

, If you have dry skin, do a facial. You get the idea; pamper yourself. Do mani/pedis, facials, a warm bubble bath, foot massages, just relax. It will feel great. Another idea is to try to imitate hair styles and makeup you see in magazines or online and take silly pictures.

, You can look and be inspired by magazines like Seventeen. Read magazines, also.

Wear a helmet.,
Layer your clothes.,
Avoid clothing with loose edges.,
Wear the right shoes.",How to Keep Kids Safe when Sledding2," Always make sure your children have on helmets. This protects them if they fall off or collide with something. All children under 12 should wear a fitted helmet.Make sure the helmet is designed for winter sports. You can use a helmet intended for skateboards or bicycles, but winter sports helmets are ideal., When your kids are sledding, they are spending an extended amount of time outside in cold temperatures. To help keep them from getting frostbite or hypothermia, make sure they are wearing layers.These layers include a winter jacket, hat, socks, gloves, and boots.


Consider dressing children in one layer more than an adult would wear.
The inner layer should be thin and a material to wick away moisture. This layer shouldn’t be cotton, which will hold sweat and be damp against the skin. You need two middle layers, like a long-sleeved shirt and leggings that are slightly loose to trap insulating air. Then the other layer should be a waterproof jacket.These layers should be waterproof. It is important that children remove any wet clothes immediately, since this is one of the most common ways they can get hypothermia., Make sure your children are wearing clothing that has no strings or loose parts. This includes scarves. Any loose bits of clothing poses strangulation risks since they can get caught in the sled.If you want your child to wear a scarf, make sure it is inside the coat. Or try alternatives like neck gaiters or masks.

, Make sure your kids have boots that fit (remember that last year's boots may be too small this year), have traction, and will keep feet warm and dry. Oversize boots won't support ankles and may allow snow to get into the boots.If your children are wearing inappropriate shoes or don't have snow boots, you can cover their socks with plastic bags to keep feet dry in a pinch.

Supervise your children.,
Decide if your child is old enough.,
Use an appropriate sled.,
Sled sitting up.,
Sled one at a time.,
Walk along the appropriate path.",How to Keep Kids Safe when Sledding3," You should never let any children under 12 sled unattended., Make sure your child is old enough to go sledding. Most people suggest that the child should be old enough to ride a bicycle to sled. The child should be able to steer the sled. Generally, it is unsafe to let children under five sled.If your child is under five, you can consider sledding with her; however, be aware that sledding with your child can lead to injury., Not all sleds are the same. You should make sure your children are using sleds that can steer. Make sure the steering mechanism is easy to use. Make sure the sled has handles and brakes, and doesn’t have any splinters or sharp edges. Make sure the sled is sturdy and safe, with no cracks or other problems.Don’t let your kids sled with snow discs, toboggans, flat sheets, garbage can lids, or cookie trays.Never allow your children to ride sleds that are pulled by cars or snowmobiles. This is extremely dangerous and can cause severe injuries., Your children should sled in the proper position. This means they should be sitting up, facing forward, with their feet first. You should never let your children go down hills headfirst or on their stomachs. This can result in serious injury.Also refrain from letting your children sled backwards.Children should never sled standing up.Don’t let your kids have their hands or feet outside the sled. This can lead to injury.

, When your children are sledding, make sure only one person is sledding down the hill at a time. Don’t let multiple sleds go down at the same time. This increases the risk of collision and injury. Allow time for sledders to exit the sledding path before sending the next one down the hill., When your children are walking to the top of the hill, make sure they walk along the edge of the hill, not in the middle where people are sledding. You want them to stay clear of other sledders. This prevents injury for the person walking and the person sledding."
"
Stay hydrated.,
Apply sunscreen.,
Know the signs of frostbite and hypothermia.,
Limit exposure based on the weather.",How to Keep Kids Safe when Sledding4," Make sure your kids drink plenty of water while sledding. They will be exerting themselves and sweating. Getting them to drink water periodically helps prevent dehydration., Just because it’s snowy doesn’t mean your children can’t get sunburn. Before you let them go outside into the sun, apply sunscreen. This protects them from overhead rays and anything reflecting off the snow.Make sure you use at least 30 SPF, but consider going higher.

, Children are much more susceptible to frostbite and hypothermia than adults. Make sure to watch for exposed areas, like ears, nose, fingers, and toes. Check to make sure exposed skin doesn’t look pale, gray, or blistered. Watch for signs of hypothermia, like your children are shivering, acting lethargic, becoming clumsy, or slurring speech.Encourage your children to tell you if anything feels numb or like it is burning.
Bring your children in immediately if you suspect frostbite or hypothermia. If you believe your child is hypothermic, call 911.

, Always check the weather before going outside. This includes not only the temperature, but also the wind chill and the forecast for that day. Depending on the temperature and wind chill, set a time limit for your kids to be outside. In extremely cold temperatures, don’t let them outside for extended periods of time. Bring them in, and then you can allow them back outside after they have warmed up and spent some time out of the elements.Keep an eye on how cold your children are. They might not always tell you they are cold or want to come inside. Make them come inside if you suspect they are too cold."

Make a snow angel.,
Build a snowman.,
Build your own snow fort.,
Make a snow sculpture.",How to Have Fun in the Snow2," Making a snow angel is a fun way to turn snow into your very own work of art. This is an easy activity for kids of all ages, and a chance for adults to let their inner child out. Start by lying down into the snow, butt first. Then, lie flat on your back and spread your arms and legs straight out.


Next, swing your arms up and down – up above your head and then back down to your sides. Keep your arms in the snow, as you'll be making an impression of angel wings into the snow.
Create the angel's dress/skirt by sliding your legs outward, and then back in to meet in the center. Do this a few times.
Carefully stand up so that you don't disturb the snow next to you. Voila! A snow angel!, Making snowmen is the go-to winter activity when you want to be creative and have fun without leaving your house. It's a great activity for adults and children, and can be done alone or with a group.


Start by building the base for your snowman. Make a snowball in your hands and place it gently on the ground. Begin rolling the ball so it picks up the snow around it. Gently push it along the ground and be sure to rotate it in different directions to form a well-rounded ball. Once you've reached the size you want, stop rolling your snowball. This should be the biggest ball of the snowman.
Next, make the torso. Roll another snowball in the same fashion as the first, but make it a bit smaller. Once you've finished rolling it, stack it on top of the base of your snowman.
Create the head of your snowman. Roll the final snowball as you did with the first two, but make it even smaller. Then, stack it on top of the torso.
Add accessories to your snowman. Traditionally, people use twigs for arms, rocks for eyes and a mouth, and a carrot in for a nose. Consider adding a hat and scarf, or any other accessories you desire., Snow forts are great projects to work on with your kids or with a group of friends. They do take some manual labor, but you'll love the end result. Whether you want a snow castle, an igloo, or a snow fort, all are basically made the same way.


It's best to use wetter snow. Powdery snow won't stay in place as well as heavier snow with a bit of moisture in it. When the snow is wet, it will be more likely to freeze in place.
Start by choosing a flat piece of land to build your castle on. Your snow fort will need to be on fairly even ground so that it doesn't fall over.
Make the building bricks for your fort. Sandcastle pails and shovels work well to make snow bricks, but of a number of household objects will work as well (such as a loaf pan from the kitchen or a plant pot from the garage).Make your fort by placing the snow bricks on top of one another to create the walls. Stack them as high as you'd like your fort to be. Secure the bricks in place by pouring cold water over your snow bricks.
To create a roof for your fort, start to angle the snow bricks inward so that they meet in the middle. Pack the snow bricks together with your hands so that they stay in place. Again, pour water on the snow to secure it in place.
Make sure to leave an entrance or opening to your fort.Look at Build a Snow Fort for detailed instructions on how to build a snow fort.

, You can make almost any shape out of snow, so get creative! Throw on some gloves and start shaping your snow into whatever shape you'd like. Whether you want to make a car, a chair, or an animal, you can make it happen with some patience and creativity.


Pack your snow tightly with your hands so that it stays in place.
Look at photos for a reference when making your snow sculpture. Do your best to copy the image that your trying to recreate.
Add some food coloring or accessories to your snow sculpture to make it look like the real thing.

Go skiing.,
Try snowboarding.,
Go ice skating.",How to Have Fun in the Snow3," Skiing is a popular winter sport and is a fun activity for both children and adults. A skier glides down snow slopes using two long, thin boards to maintain balance and control. Your feet are strapped onto each ski board. Skiers use these boards to control their balance, speed, and direction.Skiing can be learned fairly quickly, so it's a recommended sport if you're anxious to hit the slopes. Other winter sports can take a bit longer to learn.
There are many large and famous ski slopes, but there are also many smaller and local ski slopes. Go online to find the ski slopes closest to you.Try cross-country skiing if you typically enjoy activities like hiking. Instead of only skiing down slopes, cross country skiing is a great way to travel across long distances covered in snow.
You'll need skis, ski boots, and poles (optional). Try renting equipment if you're new to the sport to make sure you like it.

, Snowboarding is similar to skiing, but uses one wide board to glide over snow instead of the two thinner boards used in skiing. Snowboarding is a winter sport that involves descending a snow covered slope on a board attached to your feet. Snowboarding is often compared to warmer weather sports, such as skateboarding and surfing.For most people, snowboarding is harder to learn than skiing. If you want to take up this sport, approach it with patience and set aside a lot of time for practice.
Snowboarding and skiing are done on the same slopes, so look online to find the slopes closest to you., Although this sport does not specifically involve snow, it is definitely a winter sport. Where there is snow, there is usually ice. Ice skating is an extremely popular winter sport in which people skate over ice using steel-bladed skates. Although many people ice skate for fun, skating is also a highly competitive sport. There are many indoor and outdoor ice skating rinks all over the world, so go online to find the closest ice skating rink to you. Most of these rinks also offer lessons.


Ice skating skills are an important part of ice hockey – another fun wintertime sport to consider."

Decide where you want to use the snowshoes.,
Check your boots.,
Weigh yourself in full gear.,
Look at your budget.,
Rent before you buy.,
Find the right shoes for your kids.,
Look for gender-specific models.,
Check the frame type.,
Check the traction.,
Consider an add-on tail.,
Choose your bindings.,
Check the fit.,
Try various designs of snowshoes in the store.,
Look at additional gear.",How to Choose Snowshoes," There are a variety of snowshoes made to handle different types of terrain and outdoor activities. One type does not suit all, so you’ll want to know what you intend to do in the shoes.Recreational hiking. This is the most common use for snowshoes. Recreational shoes are best used on flat ground or lightly rolling hills. These will be simpler designs and won’t need traction that’s as strong. They will probably be the cheapest snowshoes you can buy.
Backcountry hiking. These are for people who like to go off the regular trails, and will face steep and icy terrain, probably will deep snow. These will have stronger traction and better bindings to hold larger winter boots.
Running. An increasingly popular winter exercise, running snowshoes are designed for flat terrain, usually with more tightly packed snow. These will be shorter and narrower that other snowshoes. That makes it easier to keep a more natural running stride.;
, Make sure you have the proper boots for snowshoeing. The specific boots you wear will depend on what kind of snowshoeing you want to do. That being said, there are certain types that are good for outdoor activities.Waterproof hiking boots. These are more comfortable and lightweight, while the waterproofing is important given you will be trekking through snow. Hiking boots are more versatile based on the terrain, and provide greater support. On the downside, the exterior will get soaked, and can get into the binding straps.
Winter boots. These will be warm and insulated. One of your concerns while snowshoeing will be flotation, walking on top of the snow instead of sinking into it. Winter boots have high ankles for deep snow, so if you are not expecting much flotation, they are more appropriate. These boots are bulkier, and you won’t want to wear them all day long.
Mountaineering boots. If you like to go off-trail, or really difficult terrain, these boots are insulated and warm, and will provide additional traction with the snowshoe. These tend to be very stiff and harder to move around it, plus they are generally more expensive.

, Put on all the gear you intend to wear while snowshoeing to get an accurate number. This includes your boots, jacket, packs, and any other items you will carry with you. Your weight is the most important factor in determining the size of shoe you need to buy.


Your weight will put you in a range of options for proper shoe size, and those ranges can overlap. When looking at sizes, consider that smaller shoes will provide better traction on steep slopes and wet snow, while the larger sizes offer more weight distribution for better flotation.There are some rough weight ranges you can use to determine the best lengths, though individual manufacturers will have greater specification based on the design of their shoes.100 to 140 pounds, 20 to 22 inches long
140 to 180 pounds, 25 to 26 inches
200 to 220 pounds, 30 inches
240 to 280 pounds, 35 to 36 inches



, Good snowshoes are sturdy pieces of equipment, and you don’t want to face too much sticker shock. Be prepared to spend between $100 and $300 on your shoes, depending on the quality, use, and manufacturer.It is not a good idea to buy cheap. Not only will you end up replacing the snowshoes quickly, but the frustration from using a bad pair of shoes can hurt your interest in future snowshoeing.

, This is a great way to get a feel for what works best for your needs. Perhaps do this one snow season and then head out at the end of the season to grab some snowshoes at a great bargain which you can use the next season!, There are snowshoes designed for kids, to take their smaller size into account. If your kids want to come snowshoeing with you, look for kids' sizes so the shoes aren't too big or ungainly for them to walk comfortably.One nice thing about snowshoes is that their bindings are generally one-size fits all. As long as the shoe is appropriate for your child's weight, the bindings will fit around their boots as he or she continues to grow.
Snowshoes can be a big purchase, and kids can grow quickly. Unless you plan on snowshoeing often with your kids, you are probably better off renting from a resort or outdoor gear store.

, Snowshoes designs can be different for men and women. It is important that you start searching for shoes that fit your particular gender.


Women’s shoes are designed for smaller feet and a narrow stride. Petite women in particular will benefit from women’s shoes., The first thing you will notice is the frame, the basic structure of the snowshoe. There are a few types of common frames in use, and the best one for you will depend on the type of terrain you expect to encounter.Tubular. This is the more traditional design. It won’t offer as much traction, and is better for softer surfaces like the kind seen in recreational snowshoes, or in deep powder.
Flat stock. A newer frame, this is a sturdier design that offers greater traction on steeper or icier surfaces.
Plastic decking. Very lightweight frames, usually made from plastic rather than aluminum or other types of metal. These are a little smaller, so they can help save space on a backcountry hut trip. They are best used when flotation is less important.

, Grip is provided by crampons, the teeth underneath the shoe that provide traction. When you are looking at shoes, flip them over to see where the grips are. Most will have two prongs at the toe. Backcountry snowshoes will also include a row of teeth under the heel that gives better traction doing downhill., If you want greater flexibility to either move off-trail and into deeper snow, or are carrying more weight than usual, you may want to purchase an add-on tail to provide extra length. This gives better weight distribution and better flotation., The way your shoes bind to your feet is probably the most important decision you will make when choosing snowshoes. All snowshoe straps cross over the top of your foot and behind your heel. The heel should be free to move up and down to help you walk. When you choose the bindings, you need to look for the type of material used on the straps and the number of straps on the shoes.The most common type of straps are rubber, which won’t stretch as much in cold or wet weather. Beginner shoes will have nylon straps, which are more lightweight and easily adjustable. You can’t switch out strap types, so choose wisely.The number of straps on your shoes will depend on a variety of factors including the size, type of strap, purpose, and manufacturer. In general, the more straps on your shoes, the greater range of adjustability and support you have.
When you strap in, check for any pressure points against your feet. There should not be any pressure or tightness. This isn’t something you can break in, and will probably get worse as you continue to use the shoes. If you feel tightness, look for different bindings., When you try on snowshoes, you’ll want to make sure they fit properly. If possible, try them out on snow. If you are at the store, ask if they have a good place for you to try them on. Dirt or hard surfaces may damage the crampons, so be careful.Open all the buckles and loosen all the adjustment points on the bindings. Make sure there are no obstructions like snow, dirt, or other debris between your foot and the binding bed.
Attach the binding straps. Start with the front strap, over your toes, then do the one around your heel. After those two are done, holding your foot in place, attach the remaining straps.
Check the tightness of the straps by lifting your foot and taking a few steps. The bindings should be secure, but still allow some freedom of movement.
Check for any gaps between the bindings and your boots. You want the straps done as tightly to your boots as possible to prevent snow and other debris from getting in. This can lead to wet boots, or create pressure points.

, Some will feel better than others and you won't know this until you test a range of them. Walk around in the snowshoes with your boots and socks on to see how they feel on you.

, You will probably need other gear to go along with your shoes, especially snowshoeing poles to help you walk, and a snowshoe bag for carrying the shoes or other gear.


Many retailers will off these items with the shoes as a package deal. This can be useful for a beginner. If you are a more experienced hiker looking for a backcountry experience, you’ll probably need specialized equipment that can handle difficult terrain."

Firstly understand what is involved in a Biathlon Competition: The skier carrying their .22 rifle in a harness skis off along a cross country trail (on cross country skis).,
The competitor has to be extremely fit so that despite the fast skiing, their heart rate is calm and as low as possible, to allow for accurate target shooting.,
The competitor then leaves the range, skis off on the next loop, comes back into the range and the process repeats itself until the full race distance is completed.,
The winner is the biathlete with the shortest overall time including time on penalty loops.,
Special Requirements for Biathlon: Learn that before even contemplating this sport, shooting lessons are recommended, a gun license is mandatory and learn how to safely handle a firearm.,
In some countries, to secure a shooters license may require an examination.,
How to Train for Biathlon: You have to be very physically fit.,
Train in shooting on prone position and standing at a rifle range.,
when training at the range, get your heart rate up by doing star jumps or push ups in between each round of 5 shots.,
Even in summer, train for skiing with roller skis.,
Work on upper body strength at the gym.,
In winter, enroll in cross country skiing lessons.,
Know your body's limits.",How to Do Biathlon," The objective is to ski fast. They ski into a rifle range and shoot five targets in defined shooting positions which are either standing or prone (lying down). See in the image, the biathletes are in the prone position on special mats placed on the snow at the rifle range.;
, Because of this,biathletes have incredibly good cardio and it is often regarded as one of the hardest sports to train for in the world. When the bullet hits the target, a metal panel closes over, indicating a successful hit. The aim is to hit all five targets. If any target is not hit, the skier may have to ski penalty loops and this adds to the time scored. The more misses, the more penalty loops to be skied.

, For example, to compete a 10 kilometers (6.2 mi) course, the race may be 4 by 2.5 kilometers (2.5 mi × 1.6 mi) loops and each time the competitor comes into the same range he has to shoot the five targets.

, Naturally, the competitor will want to shoot accurately, so as not to waste time skiing additional penalty loops.

, It sounds obvious, but the class of gun license you want would be one that allow you to use a rifle for competition purpose.

, Minors may have restricted licenses or may not be permitted to carry arms outside a licensed shooting range. In these cases Biathlon competitions will need to be modified to accommodate the firearms legislation of the local jurisdiction.

, Train in endurance sports like long distance running. Ensure that you have high endurance, pain tolerance and cardio. Get used to carrying the gun when you go for a run first, then move on to skiing. If your country does not permit the carrying of firearms outside a designated range, practice by running with a backpack carrying a weight of about 5 kilos.

, Train to be accurate. Train to hold the firearm always in the same position.In prone, right-handed biathletes have their right leg in line with their body and their left leg at somewhere around or under 90 degrees to keep room for their skis, and vice versa for lefties. Work on accurate target shooting then get the process faster and quicker. It's all about speed and consistency. Train to always lie prone in exactly the same position, likewise the standing position must be perfected to the optimum position for accurate shooting. Your shooting must be consistent!

, Also do other exercises and go for runs. This is known as a combo, and it is the most important part of

your training., Have an endurance running program. Take a skiing class to make sure you have good technique. Even if you've been skate skiing your whole life, it's always beneficial to get your technique checked.

, Biathletes are known for their strength.

, Join in cross country ski races as part of your training program to ski fast. This is an all terrain, all weather sport - learn to ski up the hills and how to handle icy tracks. Make sure you conserve energy on the downhill sections by keeping your arms freely sway back behind you, so you have more energy to push for the uphill sections and the final sprint finish.

, Whether you are a seasoned veteran or someone whose never heard of the sport before, you don't want to push too hard. Almost all biathletes are very competitive people, and your dedication might lead you to overtrain and injure yourself. Injuries are very common in biathlon, especially in teenagers. Almost every biathlete has been injured through overtraining at some point or another, and these injuries aren't like your usual 'sit out for a week because you pulled a muscle' injuries like in other sports. When biathletes push too hard, they are often plagued by chronic pain for months or even years. Some are injured for life. While its good to push your body past its limits in races and intensity, pushing yourself beyond your capacity the six days you train a week never ends well. So know where to draw the line, because crying yourself to sleep because of every night and watching all your friends have fun at races is never fun. Always stretch! This isn't to discourage you from participating in this incredibly fulfilling experience, just remember to be careful!"

Enter a cave well-prepared.,
Mark your path.,
Remain calm.,
Stay together if you’re in a group.,
Stay warm and dry.,
Ration your food and water supplies.,
Conserve your light.,
Stay put if you don’t have light.",How to Survive in a Cave," Caving is inherently dangerous, but you can reduce the risk by learning proper caving techniques, bringing the right equipment, and knowing how to use your techniques. Especially if you’re new to caving, don’t go in without an experienced guide, and never explore caves alone. Always make sure you notify someone where you will be and when you expect to return so that they can notify rescuers if you can’t. Bring warm, NON-COTTON (like polypro or polyester) clothes and a plastic bag or emergency blanket. It is important that all layers of clothes are made of a synthetic fabric, even undergarments and socks. Cotton absorbs and holds much more water than synthetic fibers. Wearing standard cotton garments in a cave will cool your body very rapidly. If cotton layers are worn (as an absolute last resort) make sure they are above the synthetic layers. Doing the opposite will rob your body of heat, as the most wet layer will be in direct contact with the skin. Also, make sure your flashlight or headlamp is in good working condition (and bring a spare light source and batteries). The best way to survive in a cave is to know the cave and to be prepared.;
, Caves can be maze like and confusing, but there’s almost no reason to get lost in one. Always be aware of your surroundings, and note landmarks. In addition, be sure to mark the way out at all intersections. Use rocks to make an arrow pointing the way you came, scratch an arrow on the cave floor, leave yourself notes, or tie ribbons or leave glow sticks to show you the way back. Make sure you can differentiate your marks from those that other cavers may have left. Not only will marking your path help lead you out safely, it will also help rescuers find you if you can’t get out on your own.

, If you do find yourself lost, injured, or trapped don’t panic. Assess your situation and think clearly about how to get out.

, There is safety in numbers, so be sure to stay together. Hold hands if you must move in darkness, and don’t let anybody fall behind.

, Caves are frequently cold, and hypothermia is one of the most dangerous hazards you will face. Always bring warm, non-cotton clothes, and pack a large plastic bag in your helmet to wear as a poncho to conserve warmth. Keep your helmet on at all times. If you have to endeavor into water (i.e. if the cave is flooded, or if you must cross a stream) take off your clothes to keep them dry, and then dry off and put them back on when you’re out of the water. If your clothes get wet and you don’t have replacements, wring them out thoroughly and wear them so your body heat can dry them. Huddle with your group for warmth, and minimize contact with the cold ground. Try to keep moving (even if it’s just moving in place) if you get too cold, but avoid breaking a sweat.

, If you told somebody on the outside when to expect you—and you absolutely must do this—help should be on its way soon. If for some reason, such as flooding or cave collapse—it may take a while for rescuers to come, make sure to ration your food and make it last. Make sure everybody gets enough water, but don’t try to save it as long as possible—keep well hydrated even if you’re not thirsty. If you run out of water, you can drink water you find in the cave, but be aware that it may be contaminated and should only be used as a last resort.

, Turn off flashlights when you are not moving, and use only one at a time. Form a chain of people following one with a flashlight. If you're using a headlamp, use the lowest output setting.

, Unless you are quite certain that help will not be coming, do not move without light. A cave is a dangerous, unpredictable environment, and the risk of injury outweighs all other hazards. If you must move without light, proceed with extreme caution. Crawling may be the best option to avoid falls.

Look into beginner dog sled trips.,
Attend races.,
Visit a sled dog kennel.",How to Get Started Dog Mushing1," Look online for entry-level dog sledding expeditions where there is no experience or gear required. Courses can range from simple dogsled trips to dog sledding courses, ski camping, and private ""drive your own team"" dog mushing. Research your options online to customize your ideal trip.For instance, Wintergreen Dogsled Lodge in Minnesota offers a range of packages, including a 5 day intensive dog sledding trip where participants receive a complete training in dog sledding and winter survival skills.;
, A good way to get a feel for dog mushing is to observe it firsthand at an event or race. Consider visiting Alaska, where dog sledding has been the national sport since 1972, for the annual Iditarod race - a dog sledding competition that attracts tourists from across the globe.Outside of the Iditarod, smaller races take place fairly regularly, sometimes on downtown streets during festivals or events.Visit the website for Anchorage, Alaska's largest city, at https://www.anchorage.net/ to keep up to date on what races might happening on different dates.

, An integral part of mushing is getting close to the sled dogs that will be pulling you, and understanding how they live. In addition to dog sled rides or demonstrations, many mushers will offer tours of their sled dog kennels to visitors. For instance, the Happy Trails dog kennels in Alaska ""owned by four-time Iditarod Champion Martin Buser"" offer the chance to meet 30-60 sled dogs. Visitors do not get sled rides, but instead can observe a short, six dog sled run and have photo ops with the team."
"
Go to mushing school.,
Join a dog mushing association.,
Help train sled dogs.,
Wait to start your own dog sled team.,
Figure out equipment costs.,
Save money for land.",How to Get Started Dog Mushing2," For intensive lessons in dog sledding, consider taking classes at a mushing school. Opt for a school or organization that does not require you to own your own sled dogs or equipment. Be sure to research the school's credentials or get referrals from other mushers before signing up.


For example, the Noble Paws mushing school in Fairbanks, Alaska, teaches participants how to run their own sled dog team ($100 for two 90 minute sessions).

, There are dozens of dog sled associations across the US which aim to promote mushing and unite members who are passionate about the hobby, sport, and sled dogs. Requirements for membership vary between clubs, but may be open to sled racers, spectators, and volunteers alike in some cases. Visit http://www.sleddogcentral.com/clubs_usa.htm for a list of sled dog associations in the US.


For example, the Colorado Mountain Mushers Association offers membership to both individuals and families (for $25 or $35 a year, respectively), in their capacity as either mushers or volunteers at races and events., It can take several years to train sled dogs, so mushers often welcome help from others interested in the hobby. Ask mushers at races if they need help, or visit the Sled Dog Central website at http://www.sleddogcentral.com/beginners/mentor_list_usa_states.htm for a list of mushing mentors from across the country. Helping to train dogs will provide critical experience with sled dogs and mushing without the commitment of having your own team, or the responsibility of vet and food bills. You can also offer to work as a handler for mushers, cooking and feeding dogs, and helping with other tasks in preparation for races.This kind of mentorship will also teach you everything you need to know about the equipment, training, and time necessary to start your own dog team.

, Getting into the sport of dog mushing should not mean rushing to put together your own sled team, which is a tremendous undertaking. It is best to spend at least a year or two participating in dog sledding and getting acclimated with all aspects of the sport, including taking care of sled dogs, before committing to it long-term. You can use this initial period when you start dog sledding to weigh the pros and cons and make a decision.

, As part of your reflection process, look up the prices for harnesses, tug lines, gang-lines, necklines and booties for your potential dog sled team. Find a local musher whom you can talk to and learn the equipment basics from. They can also advise you as to what equipment would be best for your needs.

, A big consideration in deciding whether or not to run your own dog sled team is whether you have (or can obtain) enough land to house the dogs. A suitable dog yard for 10 sled dogs will require at least 1,000 square feet of pens. Be realistic and start saving money as soon as possible if you intend to pursue mushing with your own team."
"
Find dogs for your sled team.,
Make wise purchases.,
Plan your dogs’ accommodations.,
Purchase mushing equipment.",How to Get Started Dog Mushing3," The best way to find sled dogs to add to your team is to ask other mushers if they know of any for sale. Network and meet other mushers at races or mushing association get togethers, or consult online listings and internet sled dog groups. Ideally, you should look for already-trained sled dogs who are relaxed, happy, hard-working, and spayed or neutered.Contact large operation tour guide mushers, big kennels, shelters, and rescue groups to see if they have any sled dogs available.

, Always visit a sled dog that you are thinking of buying at its current dwelling before bringing it home. Check out the conditions it’s being kept in, and look for signs of illness, injury, or an aggressive personality (e.g. dogs who move slowly or appear sullen). Be weary of owners who may be trying to unload a dog they no longer want on you; a good musher and owner will do their best to make sure their dog is a good match for you and your team.Ask the owner if they will take the dog back if it is not a fit for your team. This will make the decision process a lot simpler.

, Starting a dog team means housing your sled dogs, which is a big commitment of time and money. If you are planning to house the dogs in your home, plan spacing accordingly (e.g. where to feed them and have them sleep). Sturdy sled dog breeds like Huskies can live outside in cold temperatures, but a kennel to house them will require a vast amount of space (10 sled dogs require 1,000 square feet of pens, or 1,450 square feet for tethers) and a significant amount of cleaning and upkeep. Ask other mushers for advice, contacts (e.g. a company to install fencing), and price estimates for building a kennel.Even mushers who primarily house their sled dogs indoors require some sort of outdoor confinement system.

, Be sure to equip your sled team with high-quality gear to get off to a good start. Ask other mushers for advice about the most reliable brand and equipment options. If money is an issue, look in local ads or online for second-hand mushing equipment, which should include:A lightweight, sturdy sled
Harnesses
Dog booties
Dog jackets
Thermal gear

"
Bond with your team.,
Teach basic commands.,
Practice extensively.",How to Get Started Dog Mushing4," Patience and practice are key for streamlining your sled dog team. Allow bonding time for you and your dogs (e.g. devote time to spending time outdoors playing with your new sled dogs) and take advantage of your dogs' natural instinct to pull to make training a fun experience. If the process does not happen naturally as you continue taking your dogs out to practice, enlist the aid of a fellow musher who might have advice on how to get your team into gear.Note that your new sled dogs will need time to get accustomed to the sound of your voice, and to build trust.

, Teach or reinforce basic commands to establish your dominance non-violently, and to gain your dogs' respect and trust. To start, review and practice the five basic commands:""Sit”,""Stay"", ""Lay down”, ”Heel”, and ""Come here.” Visit the American Kennel Club website at http://www.akc.org/content/dog-training/articles/teach-your-puppy-these-5-basic-commands/ for instructional details and videos.

, The most important part of training a dog team is to get the dogs to learn each others' rhythms and work together. To achieve this, run the dogs as much as possible for practice before events or races. If your team slows down at difficult points (e.g. steep hills), be firm and make them work harder to get over the hurdles. This is the best way to ensure that they will not be overwhelmed during a race, and less likely to hesitate in such situations in the future.Always reward your dogs' perseverance and accomplishments with ample praise.

They also offer increased flexibility if you need to move around a lot outside. All-in-one coveralls, usually referred to just as coveralls, cover your legs, arms, back and chest and usually zip or button in the front, like a jacket. They are likely to be warmer than bibs.


Coveralls with sleeves are usually worn over clothes, when working with materials like grease, that ruin all other clothing. These are commonly used by mechanics. Bibbed overalls are often worn in combination with other jackets. They are commonly used by ranch or farm workers.;
, Some construction or utility companies may require certain types of insulated coveralls for safety, such as fire-retardant or reflective overalls. Other businesses may require that a certain color of coveralls be worn during work.

, These include: Dickies, Carhartt, Walls, Land Management, Pella, Berne or Condor. You can shop directly at their websites, if you do not have suppliers in your area.


Go to these websites directly to purchase insulated coveralls for extreme cold. These are often made with quilted linings, waterproof exteriors and triple stitching. They are usually the most expensive kind of insulated coverall because they are made to keep people warm in arctic temperatures.

, The selection of coveralls will go down, especially in stores, as winter progresses. This is especially important if you wear an unusual size, such as extra, extra large.

, You should know what brands fit the best and give you the highest amount of flexibility, while delivering warmth. This will also help you to find the appropriate sizing.

Bring binoculars and sunglasses to optimize your viewing experience.,
Keep some anti-nausea or motion sickness medicine handy.,
Manage your expectations.,
Check out other wildlife.,
Check out whale-related organizations and events for bonus activities.,
Make contingency plans in the event of inclement weather.",How to Go Whale Watching in Winter," Different whale species winter in different places around the world, so you’ll need to determine which whales you want to see in order to determine your destination. For humpback whales, you’ll need to visit Iceland or Hawaii, while grey whales can be seen from California or Mexican coastlines.Though technically belonging to the dolphin family, orcas—or killer whales as they are often called—are also popular draws in Iceland.If you want to see blue whales, you’ll have to wait for the summer months and go to California or Canada.;
, Once you’ve figured out what kind of whales you want to see and what country you’ll visit, you should pick a particular place for your whale watching venture. For example, Cabo San Lucas is a great place in Mexico, while Turtle Bay, Oahu and Wailea, Maui are some of the most popular whale watching sites in Hawaii.


Some of the best locations in California are Monterey Bay, San Francisco, and San Diego.In Iceland, Reykjavik and Husavik are reliably rich destinations for whale watching year-round., Wherever you’re going, pick out a specific travel term in one of the winter months. Check out flight and accommodation comparison sites like Momondo and kayak in order to find the best deals, and be sure to check that the bay or beach you’ll be whale watching from is easily accessible from your hotel.


Whale watching in Iceland is most popular during the warm summer months, so your winter travel costs might come at a significant discount.
Famously balmy and beautiful places like Hawaii are especially popular tourist destinations in the winter, so be prepared to pay top dollar if you're Hawaii-bound., While you might luck out and see a whale while standing around on the beach, your best bet for seeing a whale is booking a tour company that will take you out on a boat. Whale watching tour companies know where whales are most likely to surface, as well as when to go out and for how long.


Elding whale watching in Iceland offers year-round boat tours.In California, some expert-recommended companies include Captain Dave’s Dana Point Whale Watching in Newport Beach and Hornblower Cruises in San Diego., Unless you’re going whale watching in the ever-temperate climes of Hawaii, you’ll need to dress warmly on your excursion. Take a thick fleece or wool coat, gloves, scarves, and a hat that covers your ears, as well as some shoes with no-skid or high-traction soles in case the boat deck becomes wet and slippery.Even if it feels comfortable on the beach, remember that temperatures and wind conditions will be noticeably more severe out on the water.

, A good whale watching tour company will respect the whales and keep a safe, non-threatening distance, so you should be prepared to get your view of the beautiful animals from a significant distance. Bring along some binoculars in order to make your viewing experience more rewarding, and don’t forget a pair of sunglasses in case of bright glares out on the water.Professional-grade binoculars can run as high as $2,500.00, but you can get a decent pair for $100.00-$200.00 if you shop online retailers and bargains at outdoor gear supply stores.In the event of bright sunshine and glares, pack some sunscreen in your purse or bag.

, Few things can ruin a whale watching experience, and motion sickness is one of them. Wintertime waters off the coasts of California and Iceland can be particularly choppy, so come prepared by bringing along some over-the-counter tablets, such as dimenhydrinate or diphenhydramine just in case.If you’re sensitive to antihistamines, try an acupressure wristband to help relieve nausea through stimulating your pressure points., Even if the waters around your travel destination should be packed with whales, you’re not guaranteed a sighting. Whether the whales have followed prey to a remote location, or they’ve moved out from the coastline for a few days due to changing weather patterns, you have to be prepared for the possibility that you won’t spot a single whale.You can lower the chances of this possibility by dedicating two or three days to whale watching rather than banking on just one day.

, No matter how many whales you see, remember that these massive mammals aren’t the only aquatic creatures on display. For example, you have a good chance of seeing dolphins and porpoises in Iceland and all the Pacific Ocean destinations.You can also see sea turtles and near-extinct monk seals in Hawaii. In Iceland, the wintertime marine life is less diverse than in summer months, but you can take pleasure in some gorgeous scenery—particularly the snow-capped mountains and the Northern Lights—which would be indiscernible in summer., No matter where you’re going, chances are that your destination offers other, whale-related activities and attractions to augment your whale watching experience. If you’re going to California in March, for example, you can attend the Mendocino Coast Whale Festival, the Little River Whale Festival, or the Fort Bragg Whale Festival. These local events offer food and wine tastings, art exhibits, and educational lectures, so you can pack your day full of all things whale and wonderful.Turtle Bay Resort in Oahu provides a slew of educational and recreational programs, including a family-friendly Welcome the Whales event. The Four Seasons Resort in Maui offers free canoe trips, as well as weekly presentations from renowned wildlife photographers and researchers John and Dan Cesere., While the day-to-day weather in Hawaii and Mexico is largely predictable and pleasant, you should be prepared for rainy days or storms that make whale watching excursions impossible. Allot several days to whale watching in order to lower your chances of a rainy day and resultant canceled tour.


Iceland in particular can experience harsh winter weather conditions, so be prepared to deal with closed roads, canceled flights, and prohibitively windy days.Keep your options open by double-booking boats and locations; for example, book a boat in Reykjavik as well as one in the Reykjanes peninsula harbor."

Go with a group.,
Equip yourself.,
Look back.,
Explore at your own risk.,
Leave the cave the way you found it.",How to Go Caving (Spelunking)," Even if you're experienced, you should always go caving with at least two other people. In an emergency, if someone were to become injured, one person could stay with the injured group member and the other could go for help.


If you're starting out, go on a guided tour with a professional who's been in that cave before. If you can go to a cave that has regular tours and is within a government-owned park (e.g. Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico, US), that's even better.;
, Being unprepared will make caving a miserable experience and in some cases, could mean the difference between life and death.

Wear a helmet with a headlamp. Use fresh batteries in it, and bring two extra sources of light (also with fresh batteries). And no, your cell phone backlight doesn't count!






Wear pants and long sleeves. Most caves are quite cool. This is more important if you're going in a tight cave, in order to avoid your skin getting all scratched up or cut by rough or sharp rocks. Be aware that caves often have a lot of mud and ""cave mud"" doesn't come out of clothes very well. You might consider special clothes (some kind of coverall apparel for example).






If you're going to be in tight spots (i.e., where you'll need to do some squeezing, crawling, squirming, etc.) wear kneepads, elbow pads, and gloves as well.






Wear non-slip, close-toed shoes.






Bring food, water, and a small first aid kit. Travel as lightly as is safe and wear a streamlined bag.







, Caves often look very different in the opposite direction, so many inexperienced cavers get lost even if they're very close to the entrance because they can't recognize the passage from which they came. Periodically look behind you and take a mental snapshot of the environment so that you don't get lost on your way back. If you need to mark your path, use brightly colored flagging tape small pieces of reflective tape and take them with you when you leave the cave.


Arrows that are scratched or painted on the walls should not be heeded - they're usually wrong, and moreover, it's considered vandalism.






Don't bring string, assuming it can guide you back to the opening. If the cave's long enough to get lost in, then it's too much string to bother carrying.







, If you want to discover parts of the cave that haven't been documented yet, make sure you know what you're doing. Expert cavers can detect changes in temperature, wind, and geology in order to know what they're moving towards, and even then, there are fatal risks being taken. That new tunnel that you dug up could lead to a slippery 100' drop, or remove support from a group of rocks on top of you (which will promptly make your body their new foundation).

, Don't leave any permanent indications that you were there. In some caves, touching the natural structures can halt their development. This is part of the reason that wearing gloves is a good idea. ""Leave nothing but footprints, take nothing but memories.""

, Remember that when your troop decides to go camping, sign up first. This usually requires a permission slip so have your parents sign it. Some troops require some money to be paid for camper admission.

, Most camps give out a personal supply list for your reference. If you need medications, check with your troop leader on how to bring them. If you need any items that are not on the supply list, such as period pads or snuggly toys, bring them! Do not bring items such as ipods or cell phones, as they can get lost or broken and most camps/troops do not allow them. Remember to pack light, as this results in less bags to carry. The most basic items that are needed are:


Sleeping bags
Toiletries (toothbrush, hair brush, etc.)
Changes of clothes one (1) for every day (take climate into consideration)
At least one extra change of clothes
Extra blankets (for colder areas)
Pillow
No more than 1 stuffed animal, for younger girls
Hats (for sunny areas)
Sunscreen (for sunny areas)
Rain coats/ponchos (you never know when you will need them!)
Extra bags (for muddy, dirty, or wet items - plastic store bags work well)

Flip flops (shower only)
Flashlight
First aid kit
Compass
Sandals (choice)
Books

, If you are carpooling, call the driving family for pickup times. If you are driving make sure you know the address of the camp and driving directions. If your troop has the leaders drive the campers in their cars make sure you are ready for that.

, You may want to take some boredom busters if the camp is far away. Make sure you arrive on time. For example: if you need to be there at 8:30, and it takes an hour to get there don't leave home at 8:15! You may need to take traffic in consideration.

, When you get to the camp, get your bags together and try to find your troop. They should be able you take you to your tent or cabin.

, Put out your sleeping bag. Do it when you get to camp. You don't want to hassle unrolling it five minutes before bedtime! Put your other bags in a good spot where you can reach them easily. Get out any items you need for the day.

, Start the day's activities, you may do a craft or go on a nature hike. Relax and enjoy your time at camp. Don't get into arguments with other girls, it will ruin your camp experience.

, Eat in a mess hall or dining area. Be flexible with your food choices, they won't always have what you want. Always make sure you have lots of healthy colorful foods on your plate.

, Get your pj's on. Go brush your teeth in the bathhouse. You may be permitted to take a shower. Put on anything you need for bed. Now is also the time for before bedtime medications.

, Some girls like to stay up late and some don't. If all the other girls in the cabin want to sleep, respect their wishes. If you feel cold put on a sweater. If you need to go to the bathroom for any reason at night, take a flashlight and be quiet. If someone else wants to go too, take them with you. If you are scared or miss your parents go to a leader.

, Get dressed and wake up when called. Brush your teeth and get ready. You will have breakfast and daily activities.

, Some times you may do campfires, sing songs and tell stories. When it is the last hour of camp get packed. Put your sleeping bag in its bag and put all your stuff away. Double check the bathhouses, mess hall, and other activity centers where you may have left stuff.

, Make sure your parents take all your stuff when they come to pick you up. Remember camp and you will always have memories to cherish and share.

Boys can join Cub Scouts as early as the first grade. Once a boy is older than 10, or has completed the fifth grade, he can join Boy Scouts. You can join Venturing for ages 14 through 20.Eagle Scout requirements must be completed before the Scout’s 18th birthday, so it’s best to join the Scouts young, when you’ll have plenty of time to complete all the requirements.;
, The Scout Handbook is the official handbook of the Scouts derived from Robert Baden-Powell’s original Scouting for Boys. It contains all the requirements to earn your ranks.The handbook has great tips on camping.
Get Scoutbook and go digital! It’s an easy web application to track progress that’s fun for Scouts and easy for unit leaders to track., To become eligible for the rank of Eagle Scout, you must first earn Scout, Tenderfoot, Second Class, First Class, Star, and Life Ranks. These ranks require accomplishments in camping, cooking, navigation, nature, aquatics, first aid, fitness, leadership, safety, citizenship, and Scout spirit.These ranks take time to earn and cannot be done in a rush. Make sure you join Scouts with enough time to accomplish these ranks.
Part of advancing in the ranks is accomplished by earning merit badges, which signify a Scout’s knowledge and skills in a particular area. By the time a Scout completes Life Rank, they’ll have 11 merit badges that they’ve earned.

, As you move up the ranks completing your merit badges, you should think about the merit badges you’ll have to complete for the Eagle Scout rank. While you only have to get an additional 10 merit badges for Eagle Rank, 13 badges of the cumulative 21 badges must be in certain areas. So you should keep those in mind as you work towards this goal.

It’s best to try to get the more difficult merit badges done before moving on to your Eagle Scout requirements, since you’ll want to devote your time to your Eagle Scout service project.

, To become eligible for the Eagle Scout rank, you must first have been an active Scout at the Life Rank for at least six months.Make sure you’ve got these six months to spare before your 18th birthday!

, To achieve Eagle Scout Rank, you must complete an additional 10 merit badges, bringing your cumulative number of badges up to 21. 13 of these total 21 badges must be from specific categories.The 13 required merit badges must include the following: First Aid, Citizenship in the Community, Citizenship in the Nation, Citizenship in the World, Communication, Cooking, Personal Fitness, Emergency Preparedness or Lifesaving, Environmental Science or Sustainability, Personal Management, Swimming or Hiking or Cycling, Camping, and Family Life., In order to meet the Eagle Scout requirements, you’ll need to serve your troop in a leadership capacity for six months. You can serve your own troop, the Varsity Scout team, the Venturing crew or Sea Scout ship, or serve as a Lone Scout.For example, you can serve your troop by acting as a patrol leader, troop guide, chaplain aid, or junior assistant Scoutmaster.
You could be captain or squad leader for your Varsity Scout team.
Be a boatswain, storekeeper, or quartermaster for Venturing crew or Sea Scout ship.
A Lone Scout serves in a leadership capacity outside of the Scouts in a school, religious, or community setting.

, The aspiring Eagle Scout must participate in a Scoutmaster conference, which is a conference between the Scoutmaster and the Scout. Topics of discussion include your ambitions, future goals, and how you are doing in the troop.This is a useful time to talk out the final hurdles the Scout will undergo to get their Eagle Scout Rank- the Eagle Scout service project and the board of review.

, To become an Eagle Scout you’ll need to plan and execute a service project that benefits a religious institution, school, or your community.


The project must be approved by your unit leader and the institution it’s benefitting.If you’re stumped on project ideas, consult community, Scout, or religious leaders to see what projects they may need help with.
Most Eagle Scout service projects are construction based. For example, many Scouts build bridges, decks, or playgrounds for an institution in need. Other more unique project ideas include hosting a free football camp for low income kids or collecting shoes to send to earthquake victims., You need to submit your project proposal for your Eagle Scout service project; this is the Eagle Scout Service Project Workbook. The proposal includes the scope of your project and its timeline. The project is evaluated based on the following: feasibility, safety issues, the steps of the plan for execution, and whether the project is one that will give the Scout a positive experience., After your project is approved, you will complete your Eagle Scout service project by fundraising and soliciting volunteers along the way to help you.

To successfully complete your project, rely on the schedule you created for your project approval.
Take advantage of the internet and crowdfund to raise money for your project.One of the goals of the Eagle Scout service project is to demonstrate your leadership, so refrain from doing the entire project yourself. Enlist and delegate tasks to volunteers to demonstrate your leadership abilities. Recruit volunteers from school, church, or your neighborhood., The final step in becoming an Eagle Scout is to present and submit all your materials to the board of review. This includes your Eagle Scout Application, a statement of your ambitions and life purpose, a list of all positions dealing with leadership, and a statement of any honors or awards received.Part of the Eagle Scout Application includes six references who can speak to the Scout’s character. These can include parents, relatives, Scout leaders, or other Scouts and friends. However, the references must be be 21 or older.The board of review must happen before the 18th birthday of the Scout. It’s only with special permission that the review can happen within 3 months of the Scout’s 18th birthday.

, After successful completion of all the requirements for Eagle Scout Rank, go to the Eagle Court of Honor Ceremony, where you can proudly accept that handshake and smile from your Scoutmaster as he reads out your name aloud.

Adjust to high altitude.",How to Exercise Outdoors in Winter Weather," Skiing and snowboarding are traditional cold weather sports that also give you a good cardiovascular workout. If you're new to the sports, recognize that they require a significant investment of time and money to get started.If you live in a mountainous area, you may be able to find a slope that offers lessons for beginners and equipment rentals that are relatively reasonable – especially if you go early in the season (typically October). This can be a good way to try out the sport and see if you enjoy it before investing too much money.
Lift tickets tend to be less expensive on weekdays and late at night.If the slopes are a little too intimidating for you, cross-country skiing may be more your speed. Cross-country skiing is a whole-body workout that gets your chest, arms, and legs moving in tandem.;
, Ice skating is a low-impact aerobic exercise that can greatly increase your balance and coordination. It works out many smaller stabilizer muscles, which can improve your performance in other activities, such as running or yoga.If you're just starting out, you may want to take some lessons first so you can get everything down and learn to skate with good form. You typically can find an hour-long class that meets once a week for six to eight weeks for less than $100.
You may want to wear a helmet to start – many instructors require them. You can use a hockey helmet, or a skiing or snowboarding helmet.
Wear warm, light layers that give you plenty of mobility. Avoid jeans, as they can become stiff and decrease your mobility. Additionally, jeans can get wet when you fall (which you will, when you're just starting out), making you colder and increasing your risk of hypothermia.

, Snowshoeing is a cross between walking, hiking, and nature viewing for the winter. It's hard work, especially when you're a beginner, but it gets easier with practice. It's highly rewarding and it definitely keeps you fit. As an added benefit, you often snowshoe in areas where winter wildlife can be spotted, making this an excellent opportunity for nature lovers to take photos or even draw quick sketches.
Snowshoeing is easy to learn – if you can walk, you can snowshoe – and requires minimal equipment. All you need are a good pair of snowshoes, which you can find at most sporting goods or winter sports specialty stores, especially in more northern areas.
You also may want to use poles to balance as you walk. The type of poles doesn't matter, as long as they have the proper length for you to use them when you walk.
Take a break after about 10 minutes to do some squats and lunges to stretch your muscles and decrease stiffness later.

, Kids know how to get lots of exercise when there's snow on the ground, sledding, making snow angels, and even having a snowball fight can get your blood pumping. You don't have to be a little kid to participate in these kinds of activities and have a lot of fun.Making snow angels may not seem like exercise, but they're really just horizontal jumping jacks.
A snowball fight works your chest, back and arms (throwing) as well as your lower body (dodging and running).
Sledding is a great way to get a good workout, because once you get to the bottom of the hill you have to run back up again. Think of it as interval training with a fun slide. You can even use your arms and upper body to steer your sled.

, If you're planning on going out with friends or family, building an ice structure can be a real team-building experience as well as a good workout. When you're done, you can curl up together with a mug of hot cocoa in your new ice and snow retreat.Search online for plans to build an igloo, or wing it with your own snow fort. You can build a snow fort the same way you would build a sandcastle at the beach – you can even use some of the same tools.
If an igloo or a fort seem a little over-the-top to you (or you don't have that much snow and ice available), you can always make a snowman. Rolling and packing the snow to build the snowman are pretty good exercise, and you also get the opportunity to use your creativity with decorations.

, If you got into the habit of a daily afternoon walk or a morning jog when the weather was warm, there's no reason to stop it just because it turned colder. You just have to take a few extra precautions to make sure that you stay safe and warm.If there's likely to be ice and snow, invest in a pair of winter or all-terrain running shoes that have plenty of tread. A clerk at a sporting goods store or running specialty shop near you should be able to help you find something that will work for you.
Due to the risk of falls, you should avoid going walking or running if there's a significant amount of ice on the ground.
Dress in layers, and wear reflective clothing if you're going to be out after dark. Keep in mind that the sun sets earlier during the winter months.

, When you exercise, you generate a lot of heat. If you dress too warmly, you can get overheated – even in frigid outside temperatures. Wearing several layers of clothing allows you to remove clothing as your exercise intensifies.Start with a thin layer of clothing made from a synthetic material. This will draw the sweat away from your body. Look for a long-sleeved garment for your upper body and some leggings for your lower body.
A layer of fleece over that layer provides insulation and protection against the outdoor temperatures. Keep in mind that if you're a relatively thin person, you may need additional layers of insulation.
Your top layer should be waterproof and wind-resistant. You often can find dual-layer winter jackets meant for winter sports such as skiing and snowboarding. These jackets combine a waterproof outer shell with a removable fleece lining.
If you're not accustomed to exercising outside, you may have to experiment with your clothing a little until you find the right combination. Keep your sessions brief while you're doing this so you don't risk frostbite or hypothermia.

, The clothing you choose for exercising in winter weather will differ significantly from the exercise clothing you wear in warm weather, as well as the casual clothing you wear to keep you warm in the winter.Cotton and wool are bad fabrics to wear when you're exercising, because they trap sweat next to your body. You may wear a layer of cotton or wool for insulation, but you should have at least one layer of synthetic fabric under it, next to your body.
Your clothing will differ depending on the activity. If you plan to go skiing or snowboarding, you want to wear gear that will keep you warm and dry, since you'll be in close contact with snow.
Some specific winter clothing is multipurpose. However, you still want to make sure the clothing you choose is suitable for the particular activity. For example, a dual-layer snowboarding jacket may be just fine for playing in the snow with kids, but it would be too bulky to wear when ice skating or going for a jog.

, You should wear gloves and thick socks to keep your hands and feet warm and covered. Doubling up with a thin, moisture-wicking liner and thick socks and gloves is helpful for intense activities.Make sure you can move your hands and fingers, particularly if you're engaged in a sport or activity that requires more dexterity.
Your shoes should be heavy-duty and waterproof. If you're wearing sneakers or running shoes, you can buy water-repellent spray at most sporting goods stores to protect them (and your feet).
Make sure the soles of your shoes have sufficient tread for the terrain. If you're going to be exercising in an icy area, you may want to wear cleats.

, As much as 40 percent of the body heat you lose while outside in the winter is lost through your head. A warm hat that covers your head and ears is essential, and covering your face is recommended in snowy or windy conditions.You may want to wear a headband or earmuffs over your ears, and then wear a hat on top of that.
Covering your mouth with a scarf also can help warm the air before you breathe it, making it less of a shock to your body.
If you're going to wear a face covering, make sure you have good visibility and can breathe easily. In the case of a single garment designed to cover your head and face, such as a ski mask, good fit is essential or it will end up being more of a hindrance than anything else.
You also may need goggles to protect your eyes in snowy conditions. Protect them from the glare of the sun off of snow with sunglasses or tinted goggles.

, A longer and more extensive warm-up is required when you're going to be exercising outdoors in winter weather. Since the outside temperature is so low, it will take longer to get your muscles warm enough to exercise without risk of injury.In warm weather, a five-to-ten minute warm-up typically will suffice. However, if it's cold out, plan on spending 15 to 20 minutes warming up before you get into your workout. A brisk walk is a good warm-up, along with dynamic stretching if you're doing a more whole-body activity such as skiing.
You might consider starting your warm-up inside and then heading outdoors for the rest of your workout. However, you still should allow at least 5 minutes of light-to-moderate activity to give your heart and lungs the chance to adjust to the cold air.
Don't start any sort of intense aerobic activity outside in the cold – not even shoveling snow – until you've thoroughly warmed up and stretched any tight areas.

, There's a reason oatmeal and chili are considered winter comfort foods – they're the best way to warm yourself up after a period of outdoor exertion. Soup and pasta achieve the same effect, along with drinks such as hot cocoa or mulled cider.Try to have something warm within 20 minutes of coming indoors after intense winter activity.
After exercising outdoors in winter weather, your post-workout snack is as much about bringing your body temperature back up as it is about refueling your muscles.
Avoid drinking ice-cold water during or after your workout, as it will make you colder.

, If you have any chronic health problems such as asthma, it's a good idea to talk to your doctor before you start any intense physical activities outdoors. Your doctor can alert you to important precautions that will keep you safe during your outdoor winter activities.Start conditioning your body for several weeks if you plan to do any vigorous winter activities, such as skiing or snowboarding.
Intense physical activity in winter weather puts you at higher risk for a heart attack, so if you have a chronic heart condition you probably should avoid exercising outdoors in winter weather, especially when temps are near freezing.
You also should consult your doctor if you have any chronic medical conditions for which you're currently taking medication. Exercising outdoors may interfere with the effectiveness of your medication.

, The wind chill is a combination of outside air temperature and wind velocity. Checking the wind chill in the weather forecast before you go outdoors to exercise will tell you what the temperature ""feels like"" on your skin.Extreme wind chill can make outdoor exercise dangerous because the wind will penetrate your clothes, leaving you vulnerable to frostbite.
Use the temperature, air moisture, and wind chill to plan your outdoor activities. As long as the air temperature is above 5 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 15 degrees Celsius), the risk of frostbite is minimal. However, this risk increases depending on the wind chill.
Avoid outdoor activities if the temperature (accounting for wind chill) is below 0 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 18 degrees Celsius), or if there's heavy rain or snow.

, Frostbite and hypothermia are a risk for anyone who spends significant time outside in the winter. You're especially at risk if you're engaging in intense physical activity, because you may be less likely to notice the signs.Your fingers, toes, hands, feet, ears, nose, and cheeks are most likely to get frostbitten. If your skin turns gray or yellow, you may have superficial frostbite.
If you think you have frostbite, get to a warm location as soon as possible and try to warm up by placing the affected area under lukewarm water or under a blanket. Get someone else to test the temperature of the water, since you won't be able to feel it if you are numb. Avoid putting frostbitten skin too close to direct heat, such as a fire or a stove.
Hypothermia is a risk if you are cold and wet, particularly if you spend any length of time in very cold water. If you have extreme shivering, shallow breathing, sleepiness, stiffness, or shallow breathing. Get warm and dry as soon as possible and seek immediate medical attention.
You also should remember to wear sunscreen on any exposed skin. It doesn't have to be hot for you to get sunburned.

, It can be hard to notice that you're getting dehydrated when you're out in the cold, but with intense physical activity you're going to lose a lot of water. Drink plenty of water during your activity as well as before and after, even if you don't feel thirsty.You might consider a sports drink if you're engaging in intense activity, as it will hydrate you more quickly and provide your body with the electrolytes it needs.
If you're going to be outside for an extended period of time, take care to keep your water protected so that it stays reasonably warm. Drinking ice-cold water will hydrate you, but it will make you feel much colder.

, Your shoes should have enough traction to keep you from falling on whatever terrain you face, and you need a helmet and goggles if you're going skiing or snowboarding.The sun sets earlier in the winter, so wear reflective clothing or use ample lighting if you're going to be out after dark.
If you're going ice skating or skiing, or participating in another activity that involves equipment, test everything before you head out to make sure it's functioning properly.

, If you're traveling to the mountains, for example to go skiing or snowshoeing, give your heart and lungs a day or two to adjust to the thinner air. During those days, spend time outdoors frequently, but avoid over-exerting yourself.Taking brief, brisk walks can help your body get acclimated to the air at a higher altitude. Start low and work your way up, the same way mountain climbers do before climbing Mount Everest.
Practice deep breathing, and breathe slowly and consciously. Breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth will help you get more air into your lungs.
If you start to feel as though you're not getting enough oxygen, stop your activity immediately and engage in deep breathing. Expand your chest and belly as you inhale, then compress as you exhale, squeezing the air out. Pause before inhaling again.

, This tour fills up quickly, even in the winter. Keep in mind that you'll also need to pay the entrance fee in addition to the tour fee.

, To go on this particular tour, you're required to wear long pants, knee pads, and gloves, as well as bring batteries. See Tips below for additional advice.


Buy 4 AA batteries to power your headlamp. They should be fresh batteries that haven't been used--you don't want your headlamp going out in the middle of the cave. It is not advised that you depend on the batteries in your remote control or CD player to get you through this tour!






Since this is a strenuous tour (lots of climbing, wiggling, pulling, etc.) you should wear light, comfortable clothing. While the caves stay cool, you will get warm. People who enjoy cold weather are usually comfortable in a T-shirt, while people who get cold easily are often better off in a light, long-sleeved shirt. If you do wear short sleeves, consider wearing elbow pads, as your elbows can easily get scraped in the tight passages you'll encounter. Try to streamline your body as much as possible to avoid snagging your clothing on rocks (also, baggy pants don't mix well with knee pads). Your clothing should also be flexible enough to let you move around easily. If you can't do jumping jacks without worrying about your seams tearing, change for the tour.






Gloves should be leather or cotton. Those made for gripping are even better. These are worn not only to protect your hands, but also to protect the cave from the oils in your hands.






You can bring a bag, but it's not recommended. There are many places in the cave where you have to squeeze through a small opening, so you'll have to take off a backpack (which is not easily done in tight spaces) and push it ahead of you. A fanny pack is less cumbersome, but it can still get in the way if you're trying to get through a tight spot. If you do bring one, make sure you can slide it around easily (i.e. to your back when you need to belly crawl, to your front when you need to lean your back against a wall).
Cameras are allowed, but bring one at your own risk. You'll need to use your hands to navigate the cave, so there will only be a few opportunities to take pictures, and recording video footage is definitely not convenient. The camera might get dropped or crushed, especially if it's big. Dust and humidity can also damage equipment. Put it in a fanny pack or attach the case to your belt so that it can slide from your front to your back (or vice versa) as described with the fanny pack.
Non-slip shoes are important. Hiking boots are best. Sandals are not recommended.

, Pick up your tickets at least 30 minutes before the start of the tour. Since this tour usually begins in the early afternoon, you might want to take the self-guided tour in the morning. Be at the lobby (near the food court) at least 15 minutes before the start of the tour. Use this time to put on your knee pads.

,


If you have anything you don't want to bring on the tour with you, give it to the tour guide to lock up. Valuables such as watches, jewelry, and even cell phones should be left behind because they will get scratched, dented, or lost in the cave.
You will also have a chance to get to know the other people on the tour (the group usually has 8 people, not including the two guides). You'll be in close quarters with these people, and your communication with them will be very important throughout the tour.
The last thing you'll do is take a bathroom break, which is highly advised since there aren't bathrooms in the actual cave (unless you consider a ""convenience bag"" a bathroom).

, The location of the entrance is kept secret, since there's no gate preventing the public from wandering in and getting stuck or injured without a guide.

, After entering the cave, you'll crawl through a moderately tight tunnel for about five minutes before you get to a small chamber where you can meet as a group. It's called the Decision Room because that's where people decide if they want to continue with the tour. The tunnels get tighter, and there's also more climbing after this point, so consider your limitations accordingly. This is also your last chance to shed any extra layers that you now see will be inconvenient during the tour, such as backpacks and sweatshirts.

, Always listen to your guide, relay any messages, and be very careful. You'll climb ropes, go up a small ladder, and scale an edge next to a 40' drop. There are no guard rails or safety nets. Remain cautious, alert, and focused and you'll enjoy the tour immensely.


Whenever you can, pause and take a look around you. Absorb your surroundings and take note of the gorgeous formations that occur only under the ground. This is a very captivating place, and you want to enjoy it as much as you can. It's very rewarding!
Help other members of the tour. Some people may need help squeezing through a tight spot or shimmying down a steep ledge. If you encounter a slippery spot or see a hole that could easily swallow a foot, warn the person behind you and ask them to pass it on.
Stay on the trail. When the trail isn't obvious (i.e. a tunnel) there is usually orange tape on the ground indicating your bounds. Don't step or touch outside of these lines. When you see ""candy stripe"" tape, be especially careful not to touch what's within them, as they are delicate structures which are still forming.

, Words and pictures can't convey how magnificent this room is, which is why people embark on this strenuous tour to see it.

, Retracing your steps is easier in some ways and harder in others. You'll have less trouble negotiating the tough spots because you've been through them already, and there's no climbing up to do on the way back. But, you'll have to climb (sometimes hang and slide) down the ropes and ladder, and it is very slippery. Take the same safety precautions as you did on your way in. This part of the tour depends even more heavily on communication because the person who goes before you can guide your feet as you climb down blindly and support you if necessary.

, Follow your tour guide back to the lobby, where you can give back the headlamps and get your things, if you had any locked up. Take the elevator up, get a drink of water, and move onto your next adventure!

, You must be in 6th, 7th, or 8th grade (a Cadette) and must be a Girl Scout to participate in the Girl Scout Silver Award; and also the girl scout must have completed a Girl Scout Journey, which includes a Take Action Project.

, Look around at your community. Is there anything that you think could be fixed, or anything you want to improve? This is a great chance to prove your leadership skills. For example, you could say, ""I want all the low-income children to have an access to good education.""

, Here you need to make the important decision. You may work in groups of 2-4 or by yourself. Group projects can be more fun because you have your friends to support you and you don't have to do everything by yourself. However, each of you still need to put in 50 hours of service minimum. Solo projects can be less fun, but you are in more control, and you can decide for yourself what pace you want to move at.

, Look around your community, as said previously. Is there anything you'd like to fix? Make sure you are passionate about your project and that it is something you'd really like to improve.

, Make your project more broad. Instead of saying, ""I want to reduce the litter in the park,"" think broadly. For example, instead of picking up litter, you could say, ""I will start an annual Recycling Fair at my neighborhood park to educate the public about recycling.""

, Contact the necessary individuals you need to talk with. The first few times may be nerve-wracking, but you'll get the hang of it after the first few calls. Email is just as important. Record all conversations down and keep track of all hours on a separate Spreadsheet. Collect an army of volunteers. If working in a group, each of you can go recruit your own friends. Offering incentives is always a good idea.

, Make sure all of your forms are turned in! You need to keep track of your budget and of your hours, etc. Don't leave anything out!

, Congratulations! You have now completed your Silver Award Project! Now is the time to reflect on what you learned about your project! Did everything go as you expected? What did this project teach YOU?

Find a clipboard and a pen.",How to Sell Girl Scout Cookies1," These usually consist of a few ""cookie sheets"" (big charts with columns for a buyer's info and each type of cookie, including nutrition facts, used to mark down sales), a prize sheet that shows the incentive prizes and how many boxes you must sell, and you may also wish to receive the requirements to earn a cookie pin. Cookie pins are diamond shaped pins that go on the uniform, and every year, there are different guidelines to earn one - taking the cookie sale several steps farther, as one might say.;
, After looking at the incentives, pick a realistic personal goal (face it, 3000 boxes for a computer probably won't happen), and help pick a troop goal. Decide what you'll do with the money (donate to a charity... go on a big trip... fund a service project...), and write your goals down on your cookie sheet.

, While these are often revised every year, and have probably been changed recently due to the introduction of the Ambassador scouts, the gist of them stays the same.



Do not sell before the sale starts. The sale in your area should have an official ""start date"", and you usually can't sell before 12:01 on that day. Even if you get your selling materials before then, do not sell a single box before the agreed time and date. You will get in trouble if busted for this, and may even be banned from selling.

Sell cookies only at the price on the cookie sheet. In the past, some clusters have had issues with troops adding a few cents or dollars to the cookie prices so as to make more money (troops already get a percentage of the money from sales, but it's only a few cents a box). Don't do this, as your troop can be banned from selling, and it's unfair to other troops and your customers.

Stay safe. Scouts from Daisies to Juniors should have parental supervision at all times while selling. Cadettes to Ambassadors should at least have some kind of adult supervision. Never enter a house when invited unless you know the person well, and don't walk up to cars to sell on the street.

Stay in ""your"" territory. If many scouts live in your neighborhood, stay on your street and the ones near it, provided none of the other scouts live there - don't go out the first day and hit the whole neighborhood. Don't sell in other neighborhoods, either, if another scout lives there (an exception being if your parents have a good friend or two who lives somewhere else... sell to them, but not their whole street).

, Know how much the cookies cost per box, what cookies are available, be able to give a general description of each cookie to a first-time buyer, know which cookies are new, which ones are fat- or sugar-free, low sugar, don't contain chocolate, etc. You'll also need to know when the cookies will come in, about when you'll be picking them up, and when you plan to deliver them.



Know how to fill out the cookie sheet. Many first-time buyers have trouble with this - more than you might think. You, yourself, may not actually know what all the boxes are for. On a typical cookie sheet, there are horizontal rows and vertical columns. Each person has their ""own"" row, with columns for their name, address, phone number, each kind of cookie, the total number of boxes, how much they owe, and a box to check off whether they've paid or not. Use numbers in the colored boxes, not tally marks, as those can get squished together. Check and double check all the numbers and totals.

, This shows that you're actually a girl scout, makes you look more ""professional"", and, in the case of little kids, increases the ""adorable"" factor, which will reel most adults in. In lieu of a uniform (you don't have one, you lost it, it's filthy... whatever excuse you may have), a Girl Scout t-shirt and nice pants and/or your pins (the piece of felt with your Girl Scout and World Association pins on it) will suffice. Wearing an outfit that matches your friends' or leaders' attire will create a nice look.

, While not ""required"", under any circumstances, it's a good idea. People won't have to write against their door frames or walls, you'll have a writing implement on hand, and all of your materials will be in one place. You may even wish to tie the pen to the clipboard, to ensure that you don't lose it.

Get the right attitude, for the DofE as a whole.,
Read the requirements.,
Apply to join the DofE scheme.,
Attend as many training sessions as you can - going to all of them is the best.,
If you aren't in ideal physical condition, it is best to start training 6-12 weeks beforehand.,
Organise all your kit well before the expedition dates.,
Wear in your boots before you go on the expedition, as it helps to prevent blisters.,
Pack your kit sensibly.,
Teamwork is the key to a good DofE expedition.,
Keep your eyes on the map.,
Don't panic if you do get lost.,
Try to be cheerful, and even if nothing is going right try not to moan, it just annoys the rest of your group.

,
Make sure you document all your activities.",How to Complete an Expedition for Your Duke of Edinburgh's Award," You need to be committed, because you cannot decide halfway through that you can't be bothered. Once you start you're there until the end! Also be sure you know why you are going for the award. Because my friends are going for it or My parents/teachers forced me to go for it are not good reasons.;
, There are 3 different levels, bronze (2 day, 1 night expedition), silver (3 day, 2 night expedition) and gold (4 day, 3 night expedition). Choose which of the levels you are able to pursue. Note that there is a minimum age for each level. Make a timeline for completing the various other components, and be sensible, as 3 months of kayaking in the winter might not be ideal., This costs £10-£15 and means you get a logbook.

, This gives you a chance to get to know your team mates as well as learning skills which will be useful on the expedition.

, You don't need to be ultra fit, but being used to walking for fairly long distances with a backpack can help.

, This will save you from running around at the last minute realising that you don't have a sleeping bag. You may be able to hire/borrow some of your equipment from your school/youth club. If you are buying it yourself, starting earlier means you are more likely to be able to find a good deal.

, Wearing decent socks can also help this. If you do get a blister, cover it up with a plaster and try not to burst it, as this can cause an infection.

, Wrap everything up in plastic or roll-top waterproof bags (of different colours so you can tell your spare clothes from your sandwiches), then line your backpack with one or two thick black bin bags. If your backpack has secure external storage for a bottle stow your fuel bottle there, otherwise wrap it well to prevent fuel leaking. Do not pack heavy items to one side. Remember to leave room for group equipment.

, Look after your teammates and they should look after you. If one person keeps falling behind lighten their load to make it easier for them to keep up. At campsites, share out the jobs that need doing. In a group of 6, 4 can put up the tents, 1 can put the stove on and the other can go for water.

, Don't store it in your backpack, keep it in your hand or in a map case, and keep your location with your thumb. A compass won't magically tell you the way to go - you need to learn how to use it. Be careful with following ""footpaths"" that aren't footpaths.

, Trace your steps to the last known location or locate yourself using the things you can see around you and orientating the map to them.

,, A well documented log of your journey will go along way to convince your assessor that you deserve the award. This doesn't just have to be a boring log - you can use photos and leaflets or even make a film.

Be a good example.,
Ensure everyone else is doing their part.,
Have spirit.",How to Be a Senior Patrol Leader in the Scouts," If you want to get elected SPL, you’ll need to show everyone that you’re a responsible scout who can effectively manage the troop. Participate in all troop meetings, events, and activities and follow the Scout Oath and Law.;
, The SPL is the leader of the troop, and your fellow scouts should see you as a leader.


Volunteer often, especially for things no one else want to do. Your troop should be able to count on you to get things done.
Become Patrol Leader or ASPL. Having previous leadership experience will make it more likely for other scouts to vote for you.

, To be popular with your fellow scouts, always be helpful and friendly. That way they'll have no problem with you running the troop.

, You can’t become SPL without first becoming First Class. Doing so demonstrates that you possess experience as a scout and are familiar with the troop.

, When elections come around, you should be prepared with a good speech about why you should be elected SPL.


Talk about traits unique to you or ones that will make you a good leader, and avoid cliches if you can; every scout is expected to follow the Oath and Law, but not everyone has been troop guide or scribe.

, Know the troop structure and understand how you troop functions. This will help you manage the troop appropriately.

, While it is the job of the PLC to plan meetings, having an outline of what you think should occur never hurts.


Try to keep the meetings interesting. It wouldn’t be much fun if the whole meeting consisted of listening to speakers and taking notes.

, The PLC is one of the best resources you can have as SPL. Work with them to plan meetings, events, and deal with other business.


If you need to, you can work with members of the PLC outside of official meetings or even host extra PLCs if some business needs to be dealt with before the next official PLC.

, The SPL is expected to set an example for his fellow scouts to follow.


Always wear your Class A (this includes your handbook) to every event.
Be kind and helpful to other scouts, especially those who need it.
Show up to as many troop events as you can, even if you don’t want to. The troop always needs their leader.

, You may have to occasionally check that everyone who has a responsibility is fulfilling it. Make sure that others in an appointed position are performing their tasks.

, Be enthusiastic and show scout spirit. The SPL’s attitude can affect the whole troop. Keep a good mood and everyone else will follow suit.

",How to Camp Like an Eagle Scout," There are many places you can go, including state parks, local campgrounds, and national forests. Wilderness areas are good because there is less noise and fewer people (common in campgrounds).;
, This should reflect what the weather and environment you will be in, what kind of facilities are available (rest rooms, latrines, water stations, etc.), how many people are going (you can share some gear, like tents and stoves). A comprehensive list of what you'll need is provided in the ""Things You'll Need"" section.

,, This should tell other people where you are going, who is going, how to get there, when you expect to get back, and why you are going. This will help tremendously if you get lost, as others will have an idea of where you could be.

, You should never go alone. Plus, you'll have more fun.

, The reason for this is obvious.

, After years of camping in the heat, frost, wind, and rain, an eagle scout should be able to give you a few pointers.

Approach a house.,
When someone answers the door, tell them who you are and what you're selling.,
Inform the person of what kinds of cookies you're selling, how much each box costs, when the cookies will be delivered, and answer any questions that they may have.,
Fill out the cookie sheet and tie up the sale.,
Thank the person and leave via the sidewalk.",How to Sell Girl Scout Cookies2," Walk on the sidewalk, as it's considered rude by many people to just barge through the front yard. Ring the doorbell, put on a smile, and wait.

, ""Hi, my name is ______, I am in Girl Scout troop ______, and would you like to buy some Girl Scout cookies?"" would be an appropriate opening line. In your sales pitch, you can also include your troop's selling goals, your personal ones, and/or what your troop plans to do with the money it makes. This makes you sound excited, involved, and endears you to potential buyers. However, do not say that you will get a prize. Make it sound like you are just doing it to help out your troop.

, Often, there will be at least one cookie that's sugar free, low fat, or something else that may appeal to diabetics (often, they don't want to buy cookies, but it's possible to convince them - that's why you'll want to have nutrition facts on hand, which should be on the cookie sheet). You can recommend a personal favorite or a cookie that was popular the year before, if they can't decide.

, If you know the person well, it may not be necessary to have them write down their address and phone number, but all other information is necessary. Help them fill out the boxes showing how many of each kind of cookie they want, if they need it, and tell them how much their order will cost. You'll also need to work out payment.



It's best to collect all the money at once. This is a good idea because collecting some money at the time of the sales and some at the time of delivery can be confusing, and has the potential to cause more accounting issues than you really want to deal with. Tell your customers that they can pay when the cookies come in, and only make exceptions for people you know.

If they don't want to buy cookies, thank them for their time and prepare to leave, or try a subtle hint that they can make a donation instead, if they don't offer to on their own. Hey, you can't sell to everyone... you'll probably have more luck at the next house.

, Congratulations, you just made a sale! Now, go forth and conquer the rest of your neighborhood.

"
"
Call or email relatives and friends in other states.,
Hit up people from school.,
Have your parents take a cookie sheet to work.,
Sell at church!,
Call store owners.,
Do a booth sale.,
Call local organizations.,
Drive around.",How to Sell Girl Scout Cookies3," Cookies keep well, and they make great gifts for a birthday, Christmas, or any other occasion. You can send them in a package with all kinds of other goodies... it's just too bad that you won't be there to see the faces when the package is opened.

, This includes teachers, bus drivers, and even other students (though you'll need to get special permission from the school to sell to students, and you may want to keep in mind that especially with younger kids, the money-cookie transactions may be a bit hard to pull off). Most teachers will buy a box or two, and the same goes for bus drivers. Office staff, janitors, and other ""less noticed"" school personnel would also be a good idea, since they probably have fewer people asking them. However, be careful not to make a big deal about it, because if your teacher buys 10 boxes from you, another scout in your class may become jealous.

, This is an easy way to get lots of sales in one convenient place, and your parent(s) will take care of most of the delivery. One of the easiest ways for parents to do this is to enclose a cookie order sheet, a brochure describing the cookies and other information such as who's selling, in a folder that can be passed from cubicle to cubicle. This is often comfortable for parents and their coworkers as there's no direct soliciting or hovering. It gives people a chance to complete the order when they've time, and it minimizes feelings of obligation to buy.

, If you attend church, it is a great way to sell cookies to people that you know. After a sermon or during events, sell cookies to your friends and family. You'll be sure to have an order form filled with names.


If they work at a time that you're not in school, you may even be able to go to their workplace and set up a mini-booth sale near the front entrance or their office door.

, If you or your parents are fairly close with a manager of a big store or an owner of a smaller one, you may be able to persuade them to buy large quantities of cookies to give out at an event, sell for a little extra money, or whatever else they'd like to do with them. This is a great way to exceed your goals... possibly by a few thousand boxes.

, Even if you couldn't sell cookies to the business owner, maybe they'll let you sell outside their store. A booth sale is a great way to get rid of extra cookies, practice selling in a different environment, or get those last few boxes you need to reach your goal. It also gives people who don't live near a girl scout, or who want to buy more of something, a second chance.

, They, too, may want to buy cookies in bulk. Some ideas are senior centers/groups (or nursing homes), Boy Scouts (they'll never admit it, but they're jealous of Girl Scout cookies), church groups, sports teams... the possibilities are endless.

, A new and exciting cookie selling form is called mobile cookie booths. You can be anywhere in your Girl Scout county for fifteen minutes. So make a big sign saying ""GIRL SCOUT COOKIES FOR SALE"" and have your parents ( or if you're old enough, you) drive around your town and sell cookies. So you could go to the park for fifteen minutes, go to the local Public for fifteen minutes then maybe the Library. And you do NOT need permission.

"
"
As soon as the cookies come in, head to the warehouse.,
Get your troop's cookies to a central location.,
Write thank-you notes.,
Box or bag up everyone's orders.,
Deliver the cookies.,
Give yourself a pat on the back... after all that work, you're finally done!

",How to Sell Girl Scout Cookies4," While each troop's order should be organized, separated, labeled, and correct, this isn't always the case. If you're one of the first ones there, you can be sure that you get the cookies in the best condition, there will be enough to fill your order completely, and you can double (and triple) check that your order is correct. Depending on the size of your order, you may need help with this... preferably someone who owns a van.

, This may be the leader's house, someone's large shed or garage, or just about anywhere that the whole order will fit. Inform the whole troop of this location, and have each parent stop by sometime to take their girl's order home.

, While not required, it's a nice touch, and your neighbors will love to see a handwritten note from the scout. Just a generic ""Thanks for buying Girl Scout cookies from (troop number). We can't wait to (what you plan to do with the money). I hope you enjoy your cookies, and thanks again!"" will make an impression. have as many thank-you notes as you have orders, and put one in each bag (see next step).

, It makes the delivery process much easier if all the orders are already divided up. Boxes or plastic bags with the person's last name on a tag will make the whole deal go much more quickly, and organizing the orders can be fun for younger scouts.

, When delivering to your neighbors, you may wish to load the orders into a wagon and pull it door-to-door, or if you're delivering to a bigger area, you can go in your car. At every house you go to, hand the person their order, collect their money, give them change (if necessary) and put it in an envelope or fanny pack, thank them again, and leave. Remember to mark off who you've delivered to and that they've paid.

""Smear"" your waste across the bigger, flatter rock.,
Wipe.",How to Go to the Bathroom in the Woods," Even if you're just heading out for a day hike you should know what the proper waste disposal guidelines are for the area you're going to be in. You can usually check this with the park service of whatever area you'll be in.Certain terrain requires that you pack out your waste. This is especially true of areas that are sensitive to water pollution like river canyons. You can buy biodegradable containment pouches with which to remove your waste.;
, You will need to be at least 200 feet (61.0 m) from a body of water, trail, or campsite. This is to avoid water contamination, spread of disease, an unsightly mess, as well as to avoid unwanted attention from animals.Try to find a place that isn't too shady, as sunlight will help hasten the decomposition process of your waste. If you're trying to get the turd out you can just pull it out with the thumb and fore finger.

, You can use a rock or a spade (if you brought one) to dig a hole at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) deep and 8 inches (20.3 cm) across. This is often called a ""cat hole"" and it needs to be so deep to help cover your waste and avoid possible contamination, etc. Make sure that you follow this rule.

, Some people prefer to find a couple of large rocks or a log to rest their butt against when they are going to the bathroom outdoors, but unless you have a physical disability there's really no reason not to squat.


Remember, folks who have to squat down to pee, hold your jeans or trousers away from yourself so that you don't pee on them.

, You can bring toilet paper or baby wipes with you and use those, although you'll need to put them in a plastic baggy afterwards and carry them out with you. Otherwise you can wipe with leaves, snow, a smooth river stone, whatever works best for you.


Make sure that you know the poisonous plants or trees in the area where you're hiking, otherwise you might accidentally grab something like poison oak and then you'll be very sorry.

, When you're finished you'll want to make sure that you cover the hole and your business with soil, leaves, and twigs all the way to the top. This way it won't attract the attention of any inquisitive animals and won't spread contamination or be an unsightly mess.

, You will want to make sure that you didn't get any contaminate on your hands, so make sure to bring along some hand sanitizer, or biodegradable soap to clean them.The reason you need to use biodegradable soap is that regular soap can cause algae blooms in water sources, which is really bad for them., Even there you'll want to make sure that you're away from a trail, or water, or where you've set up a campsite. It's best to find an area with exposed rocks and direct sunlight. You'll be doing something that backpackers call ""smearing"".

, Again, sunlight on your waste will help make it decompose more quickly and avoid attracting any sort of trouble. You will do your business on this flat rock.

, You will use this to help make sure that you can use it to smear your waste across the first rock.

, As gross as it is, this is the best way to make sure that you don't damage other hikers or the environment. The waste will dry in the sun, and flake off when wind comes up. It's the best option for getting rid of it, when you can't bury it.

, You can use a smooth rock, snow, or toilet paper that you've brought along. If you're using the latter, you will need to make sure that you pack it out with you in a plastic baggy. Otherwise you'll be putting something in the ecosystem that doesn't belong there.

Too often, people will try to use this technique only once they’ve gotten lost inside a maze. Trying to do this in the middle of a maze will keep you lost., Always keep your hand along the wall for guidance. Walk ahead, away from the exit, until you reach an intersection or a dead end., With this method, you don’t even have to think your way out of an intersection or back through a dead end. At intersections, you’ll usually be taking the closest path to your right. At a dead end, following the right wall will have you loop around it until you exit the dead end.

If you can't find a troop, contact the local Girl Scout Council in your area. They should be able to help direct you to any troops within your city, or even a city or two over. You can find your local council on the Girl Scouts website: https://www.girlscouts.org/en/about-girl-scouts/join/council-finder.html


If your council can't help you, try calling the national line at 1-800-478-7248.
If neither of these works, you may be able to search the Craigslist for your area under Community.;
, This is a good way to get an idea of how often the troops in your area meet and what they do together. For example, some troops may be more focused on outdoor activities like camping, while other troops are all about arts and crafts. Though every troop should be involved in a mix of everything, the interests of the girls in the troops are likely to determine most of the activities.


Talking to your friends is also a great way to find out how fun it can be in a troop.
If you don’t have any friends in Girl Scouts, try asking around with other classmates. Chances are there are one or two girls in your grade that are involved.

, If you still feel unsure about whether or not you want to join after talking to people, going to a meeting is a great way to get an idea of what being in a troop would be like. Ask your friends if you can tag along with them - if it’s okay with their troop leader, of course. You can also search the Girl Scouts website for troops in your area and contact a troop leader that way.


When contacting a troop leader, simply say “Hi, my name is Jane Doe and I’m interested in joining a Girl Scout troop. I was wondering if I would be able to sit-in on one of your troop meetings?”
Remember every troop is different, so if you have a bad experience sitting in on one troop, don’t get discouraged! Instead, try joining up with a different troop for a meeting and go from there.

, Most Girl Scout troops meet once a week or once a month, and in between these meetings they also do other activities like selling cookies, earning badges, and camping. Though earning badges is an activity you can also do on your own, making sure you have time for regular meetings and other extracurriculars with your troop is important., Though you can join Girl Scouts at any age, even as an adult, most Girl Scouts are between 5 and 18 years old. Depending on your age, you will be assigned a specific level. Currently, there are 5 main levels in Girl Scouts - Daisy, Brownie, Junior, Cadette, and Senior. However, recently there was a 6th level added called Ambassadors.Moving up in level is usually based on grade. For example, girls in Kindergarten and 1st grade are Daisies, while girls in 2nd and 3rd grade might be Brownies.
Each level does the same sorts of activities, however, it usually isn’t until they are Juniors that Girl Scouts begin to go camping.

, There are a couple of different ways to join a troop. For example, some schools have a Girl Scout troop directly affiliated with them. These are often run by a parent whose child is in the school. If there isn’t a troop connected to your school, you can contact the Girl Scout Council in your area to find all the currently operating troops.


To contact the Girl Scout Council, simply go online to the Girl Scout website, click Join Now, enter your zip code, and voila! They should direct you to your local council who will help you find a troop., Once you’ve found a troop you will have to pay the annual fee to join. This should only be $25 for girls and adults alike. However, there are additional costs for activities like camping, going to museums, and purchasing sashes, vests, or tunics - which are part of the uniform.If you are worried about affording the annual fees or extra costs, you can ask your troop leader about SHARE, an official Girl Scout organization that helps to cover these costs., The last step in becoming a Girl Scout is taking the Girl Scout pledge and accepting the Girl Scout law. The Girl Scout pledge states, “On my honor, I will try: to serve God and my country, to help people at all times, and to live by the Girl Scout law.” When saying this, you should also hold up three fingers on your left hand in the Girl Scout salute., Most people know Girl Scouts because of their cookies, which are sold by troops seasonally. The money from these cookies helps fund activities and events for every troop. Every troop has a different date and time for cookie sales, which depends on their location. The purpose of selling cookies, however, is for more than just profits. As a Girl Scout participating in cookie sales you will learn goal setting, decision making, money management, people skills, and business ethics., You can do this with your troop or on your own. The purpose of earning badges is to follow your interests and learn new things. For example, if you’re into inventing new things, cooking, or painting, there’s a badge for you. You can find a book of the different types of badges online for every level of Girl Scouts. You can even choose your own activity, find a teacher, and design your own badge for it. To earn a badge, simply decide on an activity you'd like to pursue, then look at the badge book for your level (i.e. Daisy, Brownie, or Junior) and find one that fits your interests. The book will then tell you what steps to follow to complete the requirements to earn your badge.For example, as a Cadette you can earn a Night Owl badge which requires you to explore the outdoors after hours. To earn this badge you have to meet people who work at night and hold a nighttime party. Then, upon proof of completion, you can add this badge to your sash or vest.

, Outside of spending weekly or monthly meetings with your troop, going camping is a great way to make new friends and experience new things. Even if you aren’t going with your troop, you can attend a Girl Scout camp all on your own. At camp, you’ll go on nature walks, play games, make arts and crafts, and learn useful skills like how to build a campfire, fish, pitch a tent, go horseback riding, and even go canoeing.


There are different kinds of camps as well, for example, day camps, weekend camps, and weekly camps.

If you want to have a nice day at the beach but surfing or tanning just isn't for you, take a long walk on the beach, picking up any shells that interest you. You can even get a shell collecting guidebook or go online and try to identify the kind of shells that you found. You can also take along a child, or a good friend that you want to talk to. It's a great way to enjoy the beach, pay attention to detail, and pass the time.;
, Some people say that the green flash is a just an invention of Jules Verne, while others insist it's a real phenomenon. In any event, it's certainly worth trying to see the green flash at least once in your life. Find a good spot to watch the sunset. Keep your eyes on the sun and wait for it to dip as low as it can to the horizon, when just the tiniest sliver of light remains. There, right before the sun disappears, you'll see a flash of green that signals that another day is over. This can be a truly romantic and breathtaking experience.

, Skipping rocks is a fun way to hang out near a body of water and it can also be a real skill that you develop. All you need is some water and a place where you can pick up some flat stones that are at least the size of a half dollar. Just hold the stone in between your index finger and thumb, so it's parallel to the ground, and snap your wrist so you launch the rock toward the water, making it hit the water's surface at a slight angle so it skips further away from you. Once you become an expert, you can have rock skipping contests with your friends, or try to go for a record for how many times you can make one rock skip.

, Go outside and find a comfortable seat. All you need is a notebook, a pen, and an open mind. Start writing about what you see -- the beauty, the mystery, and the magic of the nature in front of you, even if you're just looking at a few trees or an open field. There is always magic in the pureness of nature, and soon, you'll be writing up a storm. The nature may even conjure a memory from your childhood or your past, and you can find yourself writing a poem about the nature and how it relates to your own life.


You don't have to be Emily Dickinson to write something meaningful about the outdoors. The best part is, you don't have to show what you write to a soul. Writing poems about nature can be a transcendent experience.

, Bird-watching is a fun activity that is perfect for enjoying the outdoors for people who have patience and a real love for nature. To go bird-watching, you'll need to find a wooded area, get some binoculars and a notebook for taking notes, and a guidebook that can help you identify the birds you're looking for. People who are serious birdwatchers can spend hours in one place, in search of a certain rare bird. However, this doesn't have to be you. You can take a more casual approach and have fun exploring a new area, searching for birds at the same time.


This is also a great thing to with kids, to help them develop a love for nature.

, Biking is a perfect way to get in touch with the outdoors. You can take a long bike ride in an outdoorsy area by yourself, join a biking club, or even enter a biking race. You'll really enjoy nature when you feel the wind whipping at your face and see the greenery flashing by as you pedal your feet. Biking is also a great way to get some exercise and to get your heart rate up -- just make sure to wear a helmet. The best part about biking is that it's also a form of transportation, so if you want to make enjoyment of the outdoors a more regular part of your life, then you can start biking to work or to run errands, if you can.

, Running is the perfect way to enjoy the outdoors. If you get into the zone, soon you'll only feel your feet hitting the pavement while you connect with nature. Pick a path surrounded by greenery, or even venture into trodden paths in the woods (as long as you know where you're going), and soon you'll be feeling at one with the trees. If you really want to enjoy nature, ditch the iPod and enjoy your surroundings; in spite of what you may think, you'll still be able to enjoy your surroundings, even if you're in the middle of an intense workout. Step outside to run while the sun is out to commune with nature even more, and to get a little bit of sun in the process.


Many people believe that being out in the sunshine can actually make you feel happier, so take advantage of this whenever you can.

, Whether you're swimming in a lake, the ocean, or an outdoor pool, swimming outside is another great way to enjoy the outdoors. Take a swimming buddy, or go by yourself to enjoy the water for half an hour or more. It can also be fun just to swim in place while talking to a good friend, playing water volleyball, or even doing handstands instead of swimming. If you're in the ocean, try body surfing on a wave and see how far you can go. Swimming also happens to be an amazing full body workout -- what have you got to lose?

, Just being at the beach is another amazing way to enjoy the outdoors. You can set up a picnic, have some beers and listen to some good music, play beach volleyball, or throw around a Frisbee. You can also just read some magazines and get a great tan. Get creative and create makeshift goals in between coolers and play some fun beach volleyball. You can also bury someone in sand, or make a sandcastle or sand sculpture. It can feel like a hassle to organize a group of people to go to the beach, but you won't regret it once you're all there enjoying the sunshine.

, Camping is another great way to enjoy the outdoors. You'll need to get your gear together, such as your tent, sleeping bags, bug spray, food, water, and a bunch of other equipment, but it'll be worth it once you pitch your tent and feel at one with nature. Obviously, it's best to go with someone who knows what he or she is doing, so you're able to pitch your tent, cook food, and avoid danger. Many people think ""going rugged"" is not for them, but you'll see that this is a wonderful way to feel close to nature!


Sleeping in a tent really not your thing? You can go ""glamping,"" checking into a very rural hotel in the evenings and spending the days outdoors.

, Depending on where you live, going white water rafting down a river is one of the most fun and exhilarating experiences you can have, and it's a wonderful way to really enjoy the outdoors. You'll need a strong raft, oars, life vests, and a knowledgeable guide who can help you traverse the choppy terrain. You can choose your level of difficulty, so if you're nervous, you can go through pretty mild waters, at first. The more adventurous can go rafting through more treacherous territory once they have some experience.

, More of a snow bunny? Then, if weather permits -- or if you can go to a snowy place like Lake Tahoe at the right time -- then you should go skiing or snowboarding as a way to enjoy the outdoors. If you're an absolute beginner, don't worry. There will be classes for you, and lots of help. You'll feel at one with nature when you feel your skis hitting the fresh, crisp snow. If you're not into winter athletics and would rather just enjoy the beautiful snow, then you can skip the sporty stuff and go straight for the hot chocolate and hot tub, or make a snow man or snow angel instead.


You can also try snow tubing. You'll still get the exhilarating feeling of going down a snowy hill without any of the work. You'll just have to get into the tube safely and then sit back and enjoy the ride.

, Horseback riding is another great way to enjoy nature, and anyone can do it with enough help and practice. Find someone who knows what he's doing and sign up for a horseback riding tour. You'll get the equipment you need and will be told how to steer and control the horse to get it to do what you want. Beginners won't be taken too far out of their comfort zones, and you won't have to steer a galloping horse down a mountain on your first go-around. Being with a beautiful, powerful animal like a horse in the outdoors is an amazing way to enjoy nature in its purest form.

, Picnics are so underrated. There's something to be said for packing a basket of tasty and simple food, a blanket, and sitting in the great outdoors to enjoy it. You can have a picnic in the middle of a park or venture further out into the woods. Just pack some simple sandwiches, strawberries, cheese and crackers, or even a bottle of wine and plastic glasses, and have at it. This can be a romantic surprise to plan for your partner, or just a great way for you and your friends to enjoy yourselves and maybe do some people watching in the process.

, People don't go on enough walks anymore. People tend to hide in their cars or just to avoid this most basic form of human movement because they think that if they're going from one place to another, they might as well be driving or running. In fact, walking is one of the most basic ways to enjoy the outdoors and to really notice the nature around you. Don't bring your phone or your iPod, and just enjoy being alone with your own thoughts and noticing the world around you. It can be a truly meditative experience.


Make a goal to make walking a bigger part of your life. Ask yourself when you can substitute walking for driving or taking the bus or public transportation.

, There are so many great sports that can help you enjoy the outdoors, such as tennis, soccer, basketball, badminton, volleyball, or golf. Stop playing sports on your Wii and get some friends together to play an organized game outdoors. You don't have to worry about being great at it or making thing super competitive. Just make it all about having fun with your friends and enjoying being outdoors.

, Who says fishing has to only be for old men? Anyone can enjoy a nice long morning of fishing, or even some afternoon fishing, if they know what they're doing. It's really quite simple: you hook your bait, cast your line, and wait for a fish to bite. Then all you've got to do is reel him in. The hardest part can be waiting for a fish to bite, which can take a while, but it's all part of the fun. Fishing is great with friends, because you can just sit back and have long, philosophical conversations. If you catch the right fish, you can even have him for dinner (and we don't mean as a guest).


Just make sure to look into local laws, wherever you are -- it's likely that you'll need a fishing license to go fishing.
It's best to be with someone who knows what he's doing. One of the tricky parts is knowing how to untangle your line, or to remove the hook from the fish after you get him out of the water -- this can get a bit messy.

, Want to enjoy the outdoors without exerting yourself? One of the best ways to do it is to have an outdoor barbecue. Tell each of your friends to bring something, and all you'll have to worry about is finding a comfortable place to do it (ideally, your own backyard or a park), and grilling those burgers, hot dogs, and vegetarian what-have-yous. This can be a great way to be outside with friends without having to do a lick of exercise.

, This may sound silly, but it's so much fun! Get a few of your friends out to a nice, sunny spot, and give each of them a copy of a play -- or just a scene from one. Cast your characters, and have fun performing the lines, whether you're channeling Shakespeare or Eugene O'Neill. And heck, if you're really feeling creative, you can write a play of your own and have your friends perform it. You can even memorize the play and then perform it for others, even if you're just performing for a small group of friends and family. The important thing is that you're outside, breathing the fresh air!

, Who says you have to stay cooped up indoors when it's raining? If you're adventurous, go running outside in the rain, play soccer in the rain, or just go outside and spin around, feeling at one with it all -- as long as there's no lightning, of course. If you don't want to go out in the rain, you can also sit on a porch and enjoy a cup of tea and a good book, listening to the patter of the rain hitting the roads, washing everything anew.


Some people find the rain to be sad and depressing, but that doesn't have to be you. You should look at is a beautiful, replenishing phenomenon.

, Stargazing can be a magical, not to mention a very romantic, way to spend your time. All you need is a good spot where you can see the sky, away from all the light pollution, a telescope, and a book or guide that can help your recognize some of the constellations, such as the Big Dipper, Cassiopeia, or Orion. You can even ditch the telescope or guidebook and find a beautiful place where you can see the sky, away form the cities and all of the noise that comes with them. If you're with a romantic partner, a bottle of red wine can help you see the stars with even more clarity.

Find an item you can use to mark each path.,
Pick a random path and follow it to the next junction.,
Mark paths as you follow them.,
Prioritize unmarked paths at intersections.,
Avoid taking paths that are marked twice.,
Backtrack out of dead ends.,
Keep following paths that aren’t marked more than once.",How to Find Your Way Through a Maze2," It’s important that the marking tool you use is appropriate to the maze’s floor. For example, you can use chalk on a hard surface like wood or concrete. For other surfaces, consider using objects you can leave behind, like bread crumbs or some rocks.

Whatever item you use, you have to be able to make two distinct kinds of markings; you need to differentiate between paths you’ve taken once or twice., Each maze will have a different layout at the start; some may start with an intersection and others will have only one path. In either case, choose any path and start walking forward until you either reach an intersection or a dead end., It’s crucial to keep track of what paths you’ve already taken for Trémaux’s Algorithm to work. Make sure to mark both the beginning and end of each path using whatever marker you’ve chosen.

If you take a path for the first time, you’ll want to mark it once. With chalk, a simple line will suffice. If you’re using objects like a pile of rocks, leave a rock at the beginning and end of the path.
If you follow a path for the second time, mark it again. Using chalk will mean drawing a second line, while with objects you’ll just leave a second behind.
If you reach a dead end, mark the path so you’ll recognize it as such. For instance, if you’re using chalk, mark the path with a “D”. Make this marking close to the intersection the path leads to. , Whenever you arrive at an intersection, take a moment to note the markings on each path. Some might be unmarked while others will show that you’ve taken them once (or twice) already. You should prioritize paths that are unmarked, as following these gives you a better chance of moving forward. If all paths are marked once, pick one at random., If you have to follow a path that you’ve already marked once, you should mark it a second time. Under Trémaux’s algorithm, marking a path twice means it won’t take you to the exit. If you find an intersection where a path is marked twice, always choose another path, even if that means going back the way you came., If you reach a dead end, you want to return to the last intersection you crossed. Make sure to mark the path to remember that it leads to a dead end. Once you arrive at the intersection, pick among the remaining paths and continue crossing the maze., If you consistently do this, you should eventually find the exit. Note that you won’t necessarily find the easiest or most direct path out of a maze, but you are guaranteed to find the exit. Trémaux’s algorithm essentially gives you the ability to test a larger number of paths, using a system to determine the ones that definitely don’t lead to the exit. It will beat any maze eventually. "
"
Note your exit.,
Use a map.,
Look for noisy areas.,
Keep your group together.,
Use your phone’s GPS.,
Drag your hand along the wall.,
Follow others.,
Look for landmarks.",How to Find Your Way Through a Corn Maze1," Before you enter the maze, know where you will be exiting. If it’s not apparent, ask an employee. Keep in mind the direction you’re heading while walking the maze.


While it helps to keep the exit in mind, remember mazes are made to be confusing. You may start venturing in the direction of the exit only to find yourself back where you started!;
, An employee should hand you a map before you get started. Use a pencil to follow the trails you pass so you know which direction to go. A map will also help you escape a trap.


While using the map, note your location. Keep note of turns and intersections that look familiar. Look for checkpoints. This will help assure that you do not walk down the same path twice.

, Pay attention to where traffic sounds are coming from. If there are carnival rides or any other loud events, pay attention to their location to help you place where you are in the maze.


Ask people in your group to be quiet and listen for these noises, too. Working together can be more effective.

, Stay together until you find your way out. Being lost as a group is hard enough. It's much more difficult to find your way out if you are also trying to find members of your group at the same time.

, While you may not have phone reception deep in a corn maze, this step is worth a shot. Look up a nearby location on your phone as your destination location. Follow the directions of your GPS until you find your way out of the maze.

, Choose either the left or right side and stick with it. Keep dragging your hand along the same side of the wall until you find your way out. This technique will not work if there are open areas where the wall ends.

, Other may have already gone through the maze and know how to find their way out. While this technique doesn’t always work, you may feel better to have a bigger group with you.


They may have new ideas you haven't thought of yet.
If you are both confused, ask them if they want to work with you to find your way out together.

, While most areas of the maze will look the same after a while, you may find small differences that make certain areas stand out. Look for items that show up repeatedly. For example, if there is a Coke bottle in a corner that you keep coming across, you may realize you’ve passed this area before..


Some mazes have clues throughout the maze to help you find your way. Answering the clues correctly will guide you in the right direction. Answering them wrong means heading in the wrong direction or back in a circle."

Hire a punt.,
Stand at the stern of the boat.,
To lift the pole, raise your right hand and allow the pole to slide through your left hand.,
Angle the pole so that it is pointing slightly underneath the boat, then throw it downwards, allowing it to slide through your hands.,
When the pole hits the river bed, tighten your grip and begin to push downwards.,
Once your hands have reached the top of the pole, bend down to give a final shove.

,
If the river bed feels soft, give the pole a slight twist to release it from the mud.

,
Stand upright and allow the pole to trail behind you.,
Prepare for the next stroke by lifting the pole out of the water in the manner described above, gradually rotating it back to vertical at the same time.

,
Repeat this cycle a few times per minute to keep the punt moving.

",How to Get Around in a Punt," A punt is usually supplied with a pole, seat cushions, and a small paddle (for emergency use only). If selecting a pole yourself, hold it upright and spin it around to check that it is straight.;
, Stand as close to the end as possible and facing to one side. Grip the pole with both hands, holding it vertically and with one end in the water. If you are right-handed, your right hand should be below your left. Ensure that the pole is the correct way up: the bottom end will often have a 'shoe' on it to grip the river bed, which is occasionally mistaken for a handle.

, At the same time, bring your left hand downwards to meet the right. When your hands are close together, reverse the action: lift with your left hand whilst sliding your right hand downwards. Repeat until the pole is clear of the water.

, Do not attempt to lower it gently, as it tends to float.

, Pass it through your hands as if you were trying to climb up it.

,,, The pole can now be used like a tiller for steering. If you swing the top end of the pole to the left, the punt will turn to the right and vice versa.

"
Stay calm.,
Look for an employee.,
Yell.,
Call 911 if it’s a true emergency.",How to Find Your Way Through a Corn Maze2," It is easy to get panicked if you are lost. Take a deep breath and count to 10. Sit down for a few minutes and close your eyes to regroup before trying again. Remember that corn mazes have preparations in place for those who get lost.


Good corn mazes keep count and have staff walk the maze. If you keep your head clear, you’ll make it out just fine.

, A corn maze employee may have handed you a flag to use in case you get lost. Raise and wave your flag if you have one. Some other corn mazes have watch towers or call boxes where employees can keep an eye on you. Other have corn cops that wander through the maze in search of people who need help., As a final resort, try yelling. An employee should be able to follow your voice to find your location in the maze. Yelling may also result in another non-employee person to come to your aid. Don’t yell unless you absolutely feel that you need to get out of the maze immediately.

, Tell them the name of the farm. Give them your best guess as to your location in the corn maze. Let them know if anyone is hurt or the nature of your emergency."
"
Charge your cell phone.,
Record the number to the farm.,
Download a light app on your phone.,
Go during the day.,
Use a website for help.,
Observe the bird’s eye view of a maze.,
Note the safety measures of the farm.",How to Find Your Way Through a Corn Maze3," Make sure your phone is charged before you enter the maze. This will come in handy if you need to call 911. You will also be able to use your phone’s GPS to help guide your way out.

, Look up the farm’s phone number ahead of time. Keep the number on a piece of paper in a safe place in case your cell phone dies. This way you can ask a patron to borrow their phone if you need to make an emergency phone call.

, Use your phone’s app store to read reviews on flashlight apps and download one of your choice. Test the flashlight app ahead of time to make sure it works. You’ll have a light on hand if it gets dark and you’re still lost in the maze.


If you don’t have a smartphone or don’t want to drain your phone’s battery, consider bringing a flashlight instead. Make sure your flashlight has fresh batteries in it.

, Don’t go at night, so that you have plenty of time to make it out of the maze. It’s much easier to find your way through a maze when you have daylight. Everything starts to look the same in the dark. Little ones might also get more scared if you are lost at night.

, MazeGPS.com allows you to find your exact position within the corn maze and help you get out. The website is accessible for Apple, Windows, and Android products and can be loaded on your favorite browser. Ask a corn maze employee if they participate in this website. If they participate, ask them for their maze’s code.

, Some maze websites show a bird’s eye view of the maze so that you can view it before getting started. Print it out so that you have another version of the maze on hand. This will give you something else to use besides the map the employee gives you. , They should be explained to you by an employee. Ask questions to make sure you understand what to do if you truly get lost.


If you forget the safety measures, look them up on the maze’s website. While not all farms list their safety measures on their website, it doesn’t hurt to look.

",How to Enjoy the Falling Rain," Lie down and let the sound of the rain soothe you. If it is bedtime, drift asleep to the sound of the rain.;
, Don't open the window unless it is bearable; instead, cuddle up under your favorite quilt or blankets and listen to the sound of the rain on the roof. Yes, turn the TV off!

, Watch the raindrops as they create puddles, listen to the different tones, from the white noise of distant rain to the more melodic large drops that hit puddles when running off the roof. Especially breathe deep, taking in the freshness of the air that only a fresh rainfall provides.

, Let them splash around in the puddles and rain (Bring your own rubber boots and join in if you want to feel like a kid again). They can take their rubber ducks and bath toys with them, or they can try to spot where the animals have hidden from the rain (birds, squirrels, possums etc., whatever your part of the world has). If you have an anthill nearby, let them investigate what the ants are doing. Ask them if the ants come into your house earlier to warn you the rain was coming?

, Relax and breathe deeply. Ask others to appreciate the rain with you.

, It'll bring back memories and cheer you up.

, Get out the old puzzles and games; finish that long-forgotten sewing or woodwork project; read that novel; dance with your loved one on the living room floor.

, Apart from needing to take an umbrella or raincoat, once you're indoors again, you'll forget about the weather and you won't regret wasting sunshine.

Go outside.,
Sit down on a rock, some dry leaves, or simply on the ground.,
Next, close your eyes, and picture in your mind the nature that surrounds you.,
Do something peaceful, such as fishing or meditating in the woods.,
Go on a hike.,
Go camping or backpacking.,
Practice primitive skills while in the woods to share a connection with our ancestors, if you want to go further.,
Doing these kinds of things will bring about an appreciation of nature, and make you realize how beautiful it is, and that we too, are creatures of this earth.

",How to Enjoy Nature," If you want to feel more connected to the earth, the first step is to experience it for yourself. Choose a place that you think that you could thoroughly enjoy. A quiet place set away from civilization is best. One of the key things is that it must be calm and quiet. Any natural setting will do, whether it is a forest or grassland, lake or mountain.;
, Get comfortable with your surroundings, and really take in the sounds and the feel of everything around you. Try not to focus on ""the big picture""-- instead, notice the little details of things; for example: how many ridges are there on a leaf? Do you see any animals (or bugs) around you? If so, try paying more attention to activity and things lower on the ground.

, The point is to sense that you are in a beautiful place.

, You will be amazed at how relaxing it is to just sit back and enjoy the natural sounds of the woods and birds.

, Walking is great exercise and the pace of it will allow you to see and hear the little things. Don't let time or distance scare you. There are hikes of all lengths and difficulties.

, Don't forget to look at the stars, whether you know anything about them yet or not. Often, they will appear brighter and more numerous when you are away from the light and smog of cities.

Find an area fit for frolicking.,
Don't be ashamed!,
Frolic in groups for maximum fun.,
Remember what frolicking is all about: relaxing and letting loose.,
Keep your frolicking in the loving confines of society.,
Responsibility is a key restriction of frolicking.,
Lastly, the technique of frolicking is the most important step of all.",How to Frolic," This can be an open space such as a park, your backyard, or a rich friend's living room that has more space. Anywhere is good, as long as it doesn't constrict you or limit your mobility.;
, Frolicking is a natural thing. If you're hesitant to frolic in a public place, go ahead and find somewhere cozy and private. Once frolicking wiggles its way into your daily life, slowly escalate to bolder places.

, Frolicking can become a very lonely activity, which is why all self-respecting goats and businessmen hold tightly onto the sleeves and collars of their wives, siblings, and children. Family is the best to start with, but welcoming friends and coworkers into your frolicking sessions is the amiable thing to do.

, Basically, frolicking is embracing that inner child of yours that used to go rampaging through the neighborhood in boxers and bare feet. A breath of fresh air after a tiring day is always great, and frolicking on top of that is true expression of freedom and childlike amusement. After all, only the children are truly happy.

, This means no frolicking past places you are familiar with; don't lose yourself in the joy of frolicking. You might end up somewhere completely unfamiliar.

, Though dreadfully enjoyable, frolicking is meant not to consume your life but relieve you of it for a moment. Make sure to return home or wrap up your lunch break and go back to work. It's no good to forgo that article you have a deadline on or that little girl you'll be babysitting in an hour. Responsibility is what makes us good people, and as frolicking is the very epitome of innocent fun, respect it, and live up to its name.

, The generalization of frolicking is running amok with arms angled towards the sky, but that may not be what you're looking for. Whether you mean to dart through the meadows, laughing and jumping, or...something else, something softer--walking carefully and in no haste, smiling at the passerby with hands crossed loosely behind your back...whatever makes you happy, do remember that. Frolicking is whatever you want it to be.

Avoid obsession.,
Have more than one person help you.,
Use a leaf blower or the lawnmower.,
Pick a day to rake leaves and stick with it.,
Avoid hot periods of the day.,
Don't track them in.,
Put your leaves to good use.,
Give yourself a reward afterwards.",How to Enjoy Raking Leaves," Don't think that your yard is going to stay clean and pretty every day. Don't be tempted to bring out your rake every afternoon. The mess is just going to come back the next day.
, Take turns at raking and bagging/disposing of the leaves. This will not only make the job more interactive, but it takes less time doing the job., What better way to get rid of leaves than just waving a blower or mowing the yard? Using a lawnmower might be best when there are not that many leaves in the area, to avoid getting sticks and other items in the lawnmower.


Remember that the rake is more environmentally-friendly and quieter than these gas-chewing machines.
Remember that some leaf blowers, especially the ones designed for home use, can be reversed to act as a vacuum and mulch the leaves on their way into a collection bag.

, Saving a day to rake leaves once a week is better than maintaining the yard and wasting time every other day. Make exceptions and plan another day when rain is expected (or rake the day before!). No one wants to rake and pick up wet leaves and mud., Plan something else between the hours of 11 am and 2 pm, or whenever it's the hottest part of the day. Raking leaves is more fun when it's cooler during sunrise or sunset - you want this to be fun, not a chore in the hot sun., Remove your shoes or at least wipe your feet, so you don't have to clean up leaves indoors, too., Compost them or use them as mulch for your garden. They can help insulate the ground during winter, keep weeds down during early spring, and fertilize your garden into the growing season as they break down, all with very little effort. Won't you enjoy knowing that you're putting those nutrients back into the soil?

, A reward can give you a lot of motivation to complete the job."

, Some outfitters will allow jumpers as young as 14, others only allow those 16 years old and above. In many cases, if you are under 18 then your parent or guardian will have to accompany you to sign any waivers the outfitter provides.

, Many bungee jumping locations are set in environments with beautiful scenery. Find the one that most appeals to you! There are many locations around the world and some of the most popular tourist attractions also offer bungee jumping experiences.


You can jump from bridges, cranes, platforms on buildings, towers, hot air balloons, helicopters or cable cars. Choose whichever location appeals most to you., Make sure this is a legal outfit and not some random guy with a rope on top of a bridge. Read reviews of your outfitter online or ask for references from the outfitter and see what other people have to say. Check if your outfitter is registered with the local board of tourism.The BERSA (British Elastic Rope Sports Association) Code of Safe Practice is a safety guideline for operators. It covers three important topics: informed participation (meaning you must understand the risks involved), redundancy (meaning there are back-up systems in place so that if one component fails the whole system will not fail) and competence (meaning that all equipment and personnel must be of sufficient quality to competently perform their function). This code allows you to ensure that your operator is safe., This also helps you check up on the outfitter and ensure they know what they are doing. You can ask about their equipment, staff training, operating standards, history and so on. This helps you determine how knowledgeable, friendly and safe they are as an outfitter.

, Look into costs in advance as well- expect to pay up to $100 or more. Many outfitters will charge a deposit when you book which could be around $50 or half of the total cost.

, You might want to book in advance to ensure that when you arrive you are able to jump. Some outfitters require advance booking because you have to take transportation to the location of the jump.

, The more you think, the more nervous you will get and the more likely you are to back out or talk yourself out of it. Everyone is nervous so do not worry about feeling that way!


Just because you are afraid of heights does not mean you won’t jump. Bungee jumping is a very different experience and you may not feel the same while jumping- especially because of the adrenaline rush!

, Wear comfortable clothes and tuck your shirt in so that it does not fly up when you decelerate, showing everyone your stomach. Similarly do not wear a skirt. Your clothes should not be restrictive or too loose. Shoes should be flat-soled and attach securely to your feet. Do not wear boots or shoes that come up high on your ankles or else they can interfere with connecting the ankle harnesses.

, If you have long hair you must tie it up so that it does not get stuck in any of the components or hit you in the face while you are jumping.

, There are different types of harnesses used for bungee jumping but the most common are the body harness and leg harness. A leg harness will attach to both your ankles and you should have a backup harness (usually a sit harness such as what you might use for normal rock climbing).


A body harness will allow you to move around more easily and complete spins or flips more easily. If you are connected via a body harness you should have at least a sit harness and shoulder harness, or a full body harness., There are many different styles of jumping but the best way to jump is the swallow dive. In this jump you take a nice leap off the platform with your arms stretched wide and soar like a bird towards the ground. By the time you reach the bottom you should be facing straight downward and the deceleration should be very smooth.


Other types of dives include the back dive, railing jump (similar to swallow except you are jumping off a railing on some bridges), bat drop (where you are hanging upside down on the edge of the platform before jumping and then simply drop), elevator (drop feet first but can be very dangerous and break your ankles) and tandem (jumping with two people at one time)., Take some time to relax and watch other people jump before starting your experience. This can help you ease your mind and nerves.

, If you are using a leg harness, then they will have to lift your pants to strap it on. If the sight of your unshaven legs embarrasses you, be sure to shave prior to jumping.

, You will pay the balance for your jump if you have not already and sign a few forms and waivers. Although bungee jumping is very safe, they will want to make sure you understand the potential risks. If you have any questions about the waiver, do not hesitate to ask a crew member.

, They will weigh you to make sure they are using the correct equipment for you body weight and to make sure you are not over the weight limit of the outfitter.

, When you get to the top of the bungee, there will be instructors up there who will prep you. If you can make it to the top, then you should be fine because this is one of the scariest parts!

, Listen to what they have to say, as it will make your jump more enjoyable. Also, don't be afraid to ask questions- that's what they are there for. The instructors will put padding around your ankles and then attach big elastic bands around them, which will in turn be attached to the actual bungee cord!

, Fear is your body’s way of protecting itself as self-defense. Try to channel your thoughts and convince your mind that you are not inflicting harm on yourself. Things will move fast once you are strapped up, so just let things happen.


Don’t look down before jumping! You will have plenty of time to admire the scenery while jumping. Looking down before you jump might make you change your mind.

, It's an incredible feeling falling through the air at that speed! Enjoy the ride, and feel free to scream your head off! At the end of the drop you should decelerate smoothly and it will actually feel quite peaceful.


After the jump, a guy in a boat might come and unhook you from the cords or they will lift you back up to the bridge or wherever you jumped from.

, You just went bungee jumping- you are instantly super-cool!

Wardens may have to work in hostile or dangerous situations.
Successful game wardens are usually heavily invested in hunting and fishing, and want to ensure that the lands and animals they love are protected from misuse. Wardens will be consistently interacting with fishers and hunters, so they should be familiar with those cultures.

, The game warden’s primary duties revolve around enforcing local hunting, fishing, and boating laws. Wardens patrol all areas that are used for recreational outdoor activities, including rivers, lakes, mountains, beaches, and deserts.


Game wardens seize fish, game, and equipment that is associated with the violation of any laws.
Game wardens also educate the public, oversee public safety, and provide assistance to other law enforcement agencies.
In some states, game wardens can make arrests and share many of the same powers as police officers.
Game wardens wear uniforms and carry a firearm.
Game wardens go by a variety of title, including Conservation Officer, Wildlife Officer, and Wildlife Manager.
Duties will vary depending on where you are stationed. Rural officers will often be ensuring that hunting and fishing happens legally, while urban officers deal with air quality issues and the illegal transportation of wildlife. The duties of a game warden a varied, and wardens often find themselves performing completely different duties from day to day., The requirements for becoming a game warden vary from state to state, but most have similar lists. Most states require applicants to be at least 21, but some states such as Texas require the applicant to be at least 18.


Applicants with a felony record will not be considered.
Applicants must be in good shape and be able to pass physical tests. This includes good eyesight and hearing.
Most states prefer applicants to have a four-year degree in a related field before applying. A two-year degree plus experience may qualify as a substitute. Check with your state. Good degrees include Biology, Wildlife Management, or Criminal Justice.
A few states, such as Oregon and Alaska, require game wardens to become sworn state troopers, and applicants will need to go through the same training as every other state police officer., Many game wardens can specialize in a specific career path that may appeal to them. These paths are all related to the conservation of the wilderness, and vary depending on where you become a warden:


Airboat operator
Canine handler
Whitewater specialist
Field training officer
Dive team
Firearms instructor
Pilot, Successful game wardens come into the job with a strong background in fish and wildlife, and must have the desire to work outdoors. Game wardens will operate all-terrain vehicles and may be out in the field for days at a time., Before you apply, take the time to read through your local wildlife laws so that you have as comprehensive of an understanding as possible. This will give you a leg up during testing and in the academy.

, There are many more applicants than there are positions, all across the country. Do everything you can to make sure that your resume and background stands out/ Set yourself apart from other candidates by taking your education seriously and by staying motivated.

, Most states open recruitment one or two times a year. Check when your state starts the recruitment process, and make sure that you have your requirements taken care of before then.


Some states only offer specific tests once every few years, so double check the dates on everything that you need to do.;
, While you are working on your degree, apply for internships at local wildlife conservatories, national or state parks, and fish hatcheries.


If you have your degree and are waiting to apply, find jobs that deal directly with wildlife conservation, or start the path towards law enforcement. A history in law enforcement greatly increases your chances of being hired as a game warden.

, Most states require game wardens to pass a physical test before they can be admitted. The requirements of these tests vary from state to state, so double check what the benchmarks are for your gender and age group when it comes to physical tests.


Typical physical tests include timed pushups, sit-ups, and mile runs.
Some states require swimming tests as well.

, Each state has a different application process, and applications usually have to be submitted within a specific time frame. Check with your state to see which forms need to be completed as well as when they need to be submitted.

, You will be given information on the exams that you will be required to take, as well as resources on where to find the information on those exams. After passing the test portion, applicants will undergo background checks and polygraph tests, as well as a psych evaluation. Examples of what may be covered on the tests include:


Wildlife management, including general knowledge or the region’s species, data collection, and identification.
Fish identification, terminology, distribution, etc.
Court procedure, constitutional law, legal terminology, knowledge of regional laws and regulations.
Map reading.
Boating knowledge.
Other general hunting and fishing knowledge.
Firearms knowledge., Almost all states require cadets to complete training courses at a state academy. Sometimes this is the same academy as other law enforcement officers. Most academy programs taker around 30 weeks to complete.The academy programs will cover both law enforcement training and fish and wildlife training. Law enforcement training includes driving an emergency vehicle, firearm training, making arrests, and other law enforcement duties. Fish and wildlife training will include identification of species, as well as knowledge of laws, regulations, policies, and forms.

, Once you graduate from the academy, you will be placed under a senior officer who will train you in the field. This field training can last up to 6 months. After that, you will most likely be assigned to a station somewhere in the state.

Having a changes of clothes means you can head somewhere else after the beach.
Don't forget to include good footwear. Take sandals for the beach and water shoes for the ocean so you're ready for anything.;
, You don't want to ruin your beach trip with a bad sunburn. Plus, protecting yourself from the sun will keep your skin looking younger as you age and guard against skin cancer.Start with a sunscreen of at least 15 SPF. Check to make sure it protects against both UVA and UVB rays. Don't forget to add a lip balm with sunscreen to protect your lips. Make sure to reapply it frequently, especially after sweating or jumping in the water.
Use clothing for protection. Hats and sunglasses offer much needed protection for your face and eyes, but wearing a coverup with long sleeves can also offer protection. If coverups aren't your thing, take a beach umbrella or tent/gazebo instead.

, A beach chair or a towel is appropriate, but if you choose a towel, it should be separate from the one you’ll be using to dry off with. If you choose a plastic chair, you may still want to bring the extra towel to keep your chair from getting too hot while you are away. You could also bring an old blanket you don't mind getting sandy.Another option is an old fitted king-size sheet. You can put things like bags and coolers in the corners, so that the sheet makes a cozy little playpen for you and your family., Of course, you hope no one will get injured, but taking a basic first aid kit will offer you some relief if someone gets hurt. You can buy a first aid kit ready-made or make your own.Make sure you have things like bandages, antibiotic ointment, pain relief pills, and a thermometer, as well as anti-diarrhea medicine. You may also want antihistamines.
Make sure you have an assortment of bandages, including small adhesive ones as well as roller bandages, gauze pads, and medical tape. You should also have things like antiseptic packets, hydrocortisone packets, non-latex gloves, and compress dressings.Also, make sure you pack any common over-the-counter medications you use frequently.

, You'll need a place to stash your valuables away from the water and the sand. Pick a bag that's fairly water resistant or waterproof so that you can stash your phone and wallet away. Leave anything irreplaceable behind that you can so you don't lose or damage it on the beach.Another trick to protect your valuables is to clean out an old sunscreen bottle. Use it to hide valuables you don't want anyone to steal, and as a bonus, it keeps them dry.
You can also stash electronics in zip-top bags for protection.For beach toys, find a net bag so sand can be left on the beach. Pack all the food in a cooler with ice.

, If you're traveling in a group, bring something you can all do. For instance, a deck of waterproof cards is great for the beach, as long as it's not too windy. You could also bring a board game that doesn't have too many parts. A game like Twister, for instance, would be great for the beach.Remember to include fun for the kids in your group. On the beach, all you need are some simple toys, such as buckets, shovels, and other cheap toys. Your kids will have a blast in the sand and water., Music is a great way to keep people entertained. For a simple solution, you could bring along a waterproof, battery-powered radio, like a shower radio. However, you can also use waterproof bluetooth speakers so you can play music from your phone., You'll enjoy just lounging for a bit, but you might also want something to enjoy all on your own. For instance, take a light book you've been meaning to dive into. The beach is the perfect time to do it.If you take an e-reader, make sure it's okay in the glare of the sun, and that you have a portable charger for it if you need it. You may also want a portable charger for you phone. Slip the e-reader into a zip-top bag to protect it.
You could also take activity books such as crossword puzzles and Sudoku books.

, If you're planning to stay at the beach for a few hours, you're going to want some snacks and drinks to get you through. Keep it fairly simple. If you choose anything too complicated that requires assembly, you'll likely end up with sand in your food.Some good snacks to take include fruit, granola bars, vegetable sticks, and bottles of water. Skip the sodas as those don't hydrate as well.
In fact, if you're planning on staying all day, consider just packing lunch. Though you can take a cooler for drinks, you might want to pick something that won't spoil easily, such as a peanut butter and jelly.
Bring a small bag for any trash you may accumulate. It may be difficult to find a trashcan at the beach.
Bring moist towelettes with your food. You can use them to clean up hands before and after your eat.

, When you get to the beach, you need to stake out a claim. It's good to go early in the day, when it's less crowded. That way, you'll have more opportunity to find a good spot.Pick a spot near the water but not so near you'll be overrun if the tide comes in.
If the beach has chairs or umbrellas for rent, consider renting one to make life easier.
Stick with like-minded beach goers. That is, if you're there to party and have fun with your friends, pick an area where people are being louder and playing music. If you prefer a quiet place to read, try to find a more secluded spot. If you're there with your family, look for other families to be near, so your kids can play together.

, When you're trying on swimsuits, you need to keep your underwear on. However, you also need to make sure the suit fits properly. Therefore, make sure your underwear doesn't bunch, and pick something on the slimmer side to wear to the store., Many websites will tell you to pick swimsuit style that's flattering to your body type, but the truth is, you can find a suit that's flattering in any style. The important thing is that you feel comfortable and that you like the suit.For instance, you may not think you can get away with a two-piece because of your curves. If you don't feel comfortable showing as much skin, you could wear a tankini, which is basically a tank top with a bikini bottom, or a high-waisted bikini. Pick a fun pattern and rock that suit.
For men, you also need to decide what you want out of your suit, such as how much skin you want to show. You could go for anything from full-length trunk shorts to swim briefs.

, You don't literally need to jump, but you should move around as much as possible once you get the suit on. You want to make sure it stays on in all the right places because you'll certainly be moving a lot in the water.Try walking up and down outside the dressing room or doing a few jumping jacks in the suit to see how it wears. Make sure it doesn't move around.

, A coverup is just something you can slip on over your swimsuit to go from the beach to the car or to hang out on the beach in while you're not swimming. For men, it can be something as simple as a t-shirt. For women, it can be anything from a pair of shorts and a top to a breezy, cottony dress made for going over swimwear., If you're wearing a revealing swimsuit and you're not a fan of body hair showing, you're going to need to spend some time shaving before you go to the beach. Take some time to shave your legs and any other areas that might need it, such your bikini line or armpits, before you go.If you're not comfortable shaving or waxing these areas yourself, let a professional do it. Set up an appointment to get a bikini wax done.
If you're guy, you may want to shave your back or have someone do it for you.
Make sure to check yourself out in the sunlight, as you're more likely to spot hairs in the sun.

, To make your skin shimmer, you may want to spend some time exfoliating. Exfoliating is just a way of removing dead skin so that you skin doesn't look ashy or rough. You have the option of using a chemical exfoliant or a physical exfoliant.A chemical exfoliant uses chemicals, generally acids, to break down the dead skin.
A physical exfoliant uses small beads or crushed pieces of seed or shell in a solution to rub away the dead skin. You'll also find exfoliating gloves that fall in this category. Even a washcloth is a physical exfoliant.
To use an exfoliant, hop in the shower first to get your skin damp. Rub the exfoliant in with your hand, a glove, or washcloth in gentle circles. Wash the exfoliant away when your done. If you're using an exfoliating glove or washcloth, simple put your normal soap on it, and use it to rub the soap into your skin in gentle circles.
Be sure to focus on problem areas like knees, elbows, and feet.
After you exfoliate, apply a good moisturizer to your skin.

, If you're looking for a flat stomach, try to avoid foods that cause you to bloat for a couple days before the beach. That way, your stomach won't be pooched out because of bloating.Skip cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower. Also skip processed foods and carbonated beverages.
Instead, try other healthy foods such avocados, eggs, nut butters, salmon, bananas, Greek yogurt, and lemons.

Understand the phenomenon of the green flash.,
Choose your location.,
Choose the right time.,
Locate the place where the sun will set or rise.,
Wait until the last part of the sun appears to be touching the horizon.

,
Watch for a flash, flicker, or brief glow of bright green light.,
Relish it; it really is there only for the blink of an eye.,
Keep looking until it becomes easier to find the green flash.",How to See the Green Flash," The green flash phenomenon arises as by-products in astronomical refraction near the horizon, and most green flashes are the by-product of mirages (see images of some below).It's elusive because the atmospheric conditions required to produce the green flash don't happen that commonly, and require a well-layered atmosphere that allows the index of refraction to increase without interruption toward the surface of the Earth. Unfortunately, the atmosphere is usually experiencing turbulence of differing temperature and humidity levels across the layers.In plainer English, you need a near perfect clear horizon for the green ray phenomenon to appear.



Pollution or haze will prevent clear or any sighting of the green ray.

Clouds hanging over the horizon can mar the chances of seeing the green flash.;
, Despite the atmospheric conditions being less conducive to seeing a green flash, if you know where to look from, you've a much greater chance of seeing a green flash than insisting on trying to see it from just any old spot. The green flash can only be seen over a distant horizon that has a distinct edge to it. This makes the ocean the best place to view the green flash from, at or as close as possible to, sea level. It is also possible to see the green flash over land provided the horizon is distant enough.


Hawaii is one of the best locations for viewing the green flash.The Caribbean is another well-known location for spotting a green flash.
The top of a mountain, a tall building, a balloon or aircraft, are all suitable places for creating the distant horizon needed for seeing the green flash.Pilots and airplane passengers often report seeing the green flash from the air.

, The green flash can only be seen at the very moment that the sun dips below the horizon at sunset, or when the sun first rises above the horizon at sunrise. This makes it tricky because blink and you'll miss it but if you look too soon, the sun will dazzle you and prevent you from seeing it.

, You can use an almanac to figure out where the sun will appear in the sky. Sunset tends to be easier to locate than sunrise because you already know where the sun is positioned and given you've only got a brief moment to find the green flash, knowing the position matters!


Position yourself so that you're looking directly at the setting sun. Keep your eyes averted from the sun, however, until only the very top of the sun is left on the horizon. Do not stare at the sun itself.

,, It will appear on ""top"" of the sun just as the sun appears to slide below the horizon. It may also appear as a green glow on the horizon just as the sun has set. Don't expect a huge ""flash""; the color seen can be very small and hard to discern. To help you know what you're looking for, check photos and visual simulations of the green ray in online images.Some different sightings of a green flash in photos:


As the sun sets, a small green flash (mirage) appears at the top portion of the setting sun.
More of the mirage.

Another sighting of a green flash.

, One to two seconds of duration is typical., Seasoned observers of the green flash know where and when to look and find that, with practice, seeing green flashes is fairly predictable."

Make sure your tractor can handle the weight of the plow blade.,
Get your tractor serviced before putting the plow on.,
Consider putting snow chains on your tires.,
Double check that your tractor has what it takes to hold the plow.",How to Build a Garden Tractor Snowplow1," Your tractor will also need to be able to bear the weight of the plough blade on its frame. Don’t attempt the conversion unless you are sure it can handle it.


Rather than risk converting the mower yourself, consider purchasing one that already has a snow plough attachment available from the manufacturer. John Deere tractors offer this as an option.;
, You’re advised to get your tractor serviced before you begin. Check the frame carefully for rust. Rust will weaken the structure, making it less likely that it will be able to bear the weight of a snow plough blade at the front while also being able to push snow out of the way.

, Remember also that garden tractor tires aren’t usually intended for use on snow. You might like to consider fitting snow chains to the tires in addition to converting the front fitting.


Wheel weights may also help rebalance the vehicle.

, Not all ride-on tractor mowers will be suitable for turning into a snow plough. Some cheap models won’t be heavy or sturdy enough or have enough horsepower to push deep snow out of the way.

Choose your materials for the plow.,
Form your steel sheet into a plow.,
Bend the sheet.,
Try using an oil drum if you don’t have a steel sheet.",How to Build a Garden Tractor Snowplow2," You’ll need to find something to form the shovel or blade of your snowplow. Items you can use to make this include:


A half oil drum or piece of flat steel sheet about a quarter inch thick.

, If using a steel sheet, cut a piece about twice as wide as your tractor and about one and a half times as tall as the front of the tractor. Using a piece of chalk, mark out five sections of equal height along the vertical length of what will be your plow bucket.


You’ll want to fold in the top and bottom quarters of the bucket to create curved edge to scoop the snow.

, You can bend this sheet by scoring the metal (cutting a shallow groove in it, not all the way through). This will enable you to bend the steel into shape by hammering it between pieces of wood.


Once bent, weld the sheet into place at the bend to make sure it retains its shape.

, If you don’t have sheet metal, you could try using an old oil drum cut in half or something like an old hot water tank. Oil drums are likely to be lightweight, which means that they will work better for a lighter frame tractor. They will also cut through the snow well but they are also likely to buckle under pressure.


Remember that there will be sharp edges where you cut so make sure to store it where someone, like a child, will not be able to reach it.

Put some weight on the back end of your tractor.",How to Build a Garden Tractor Snowplow3," On most models of tractor you’ll need to make a bracket on the frame and bring that forward slightly in order to position the plowing blade at the front.


You can use reclaimed steel joists, or something like metal trusses, as these are adaptable and usually strong enough for the purpose. A welding tool is likely to be useful in attaching the bracket to the vehicle’s frame.
Try to remove the motor deck and cutting tool before doing this, both for safety reasons and ease of access.

, You now need to attach the plough bucket or blade to the frame using a welding tool. Try to incorporate a pin or lever to allow the plough bucket to manoeuvre side to side. Add a hand-operated lever to the bucket so it can be pushed to manoeuvre it while you are sitting on the tractor.


If you are left-handed, consider doing this on the left-hand side.

, If you want to incorporate a lift mechanism, you may need to modify the frame slightly to allow for this. You’ll probably need to create a hand or foot lever so the bucket can be lifted by the person riding the mower.

, Special garden equipment snow chains are available. Check the tire to see what the wheel size it (it should be written on the tire).


Your local garden store may carry these, or you can purchase them online.

, Start fitting your snow chains by laying the chain out on the ground by the side of the tractor wheel. Remove any tangles and check for any damage. Drape the chain over the wheel. You’ll then need to move the tractor forward a few inches to wrap the chain around the tire.


Finally, clip the chain into place and do up the rest of the fittings so it is securely fastened around the tire and tight enough to grip the snow as required.

, For stability, consider adding some weight onto the back end of your tractor to balance out the new weight at the front added by the snowplow blade. To do this:


Strap bricks to the back of the tractor. Wheel weights may also help stabilize and balance your tractor.

Find a suitable place for spending time with the trees.,
Be prepared to spend a decent amount of time on this exercise.,
Notice the silence.,
Notice the sounds with greater precision.,
Experiment with sounds around and beneath the tree.,
Repeat the exercise of listening over and over.,
Listen with your other senses.,
Repeat all meditative or relaxing steps as long as you like.",How to Listen to Trees Communicate," Choose a place that has at least two trees but preferably more. It is better that they have abundant foliage but even branches, twig, and bark have a place in making sounds. Make yourself comfortable and settled; you may wish to face the trunk(s) or sit against a trunk, or sit in the middle of a circle of trees. Do whatever feels right around the trees, as there are no rules, just instinctual responses.


It is best if you can allow yourself to be led to the trees where you will listen. Actively avoiding choosing a particular tree to meditate or relax before you arrive can lead you to a tree with which you are unfamiliar and you may learn much more by interacting with it.;
, Trees are very noble and peaceful. They neither welcome the bird nor beckon for its return. They let things be as they are. Therefore, they won't welcome your willingness to listen, they'll only see you as you are and continue with their normal behavior. However, be sure to treat the trees with respect and this respect will emanate from you and become part of the microcosm of you and the trees, not acknowledged but always gently there. Your respect for the trees will improve your ability to listen, as well as helping you to be open to the possibilities that you may never have pondered before.

, In looking for the silence, you will soon become aware that a copse of trees, a wood, or a forest has no real silence. The trees are always communicating, making noise, filling in the gaps between bird song and the industrious animals and insects.

, You will hear the trees in the breeze or wind, the swaying of branches, the creaking of limbs, the rustling of leaves. Listen to how the wind or breeze flows through the trees and the how the very smallest of the sounds of the trees are amplified by the fact of you choosing to listen more closely.


Be patient. It takes time and perseverance to learn to listen to the trees. Don't be disappointed if you cannot hear the trees at first. It may take several different tries and occasions before you tap into the interactions.

, The sounds are quiet, so listen closely and attentively.


Place your ear to the ground, perhaps above the roots of the tree. Can you hear anything approaching?
Place your ear against the trunk of the tree. Listen for what you can hear; once you hear it, let the sound envelop you and create a reaction in you. How does hearing sounds through the trunk affect you?

, As you listen, continue asking yourself how you are affected by the sounds of the tree. What is the quality of the sound and where does it resonate most within your body? What does the sound actually do – is it constant, intermittent, loud, soft, or always changing? The more you persist with this line of inquiry and a focus on simply listening to the trees, the more you will attune your hearing to the communications from the trees.

, It is possible for the deaf to ""hear"" when listening to trees.Opening up your senses means noting which parts of your body are most in tune with the tree's methods of communicating, through touch, smell, sound and sight. Continue listening as your accepted ideas about communication and about trees are turned upside down.



Inhale deeply and slowly exhale to feel the discourse of the trees within you.

, Hopefully this will further enlighten you. If you have enjoyed this experience of spending time with trees, consider broadening your listening to the communication of the trees to also embrace listening to your own body. From the experience of trees, you can learn to nourish your body as the tree knows instinctively how to nourish itself – selectively, slowly in small amounts, and aligned with the environment and seasons around you. As with the tree, take only what you need when needed and hear your body's needs, energizing it through eating for your body rather than to jump start or sedate it, and learn from the trees how to get your life back into balance."

A cat prowling around under their branch, or are they simply alerting the world that morning has broken?;
, Like snails, for instance. Usually you'd just think ""Ew!"" and walk on by, but really their shells are fascinating. The gentle swirls and spirals on brown or green shells... almost as though somebody has got a paintbrush and painted it on.

, They are truly wonderful plants, with a green stem to suck up water and anchor it in to the ground, pollen for other creatures, an ovary, stigma and stamen for reproduction, lovely colorful petals to attract insects - along with a filament, style and an ovule!

, That's truly beautiful in itself. Sometimes a bright, clear blue, sometimes grey with a few fluffy white clouds, and occasionally a dark, smeary black. Above all, up above it is the entire universe.

, Seas, rivers, ponds, oceans... even just water running from your tap or down your window is pretty. When the light catches a raindrop, it reflects different colors.

, The multi-color arches never last for long, but are stunning if you think about it.

, People's eye colors are different, their skin tones, hair colors, nose and lip and eye shapes, their ears, their bodies, their personalities, everybody is different. Cities have big, tall buildings and busy roads full of traffic and different cars, buses, vans, motorbikes and bikes.

, Even a gentle breeze is beautiful. The wind gently moves your hair about, like an imaginary hand.

, Soon, you'll begin to see that you should appreciate the world around you, because it is gorgeous.

On the day you are to head for the beach, store everything safely into the car and start driving.,
Upon arrival at the beach, unload all your luggage into your hotel or motel room if you're staying overnight.,
Stay as long as you planned at the beach.,Finished.",How to Prepare for a Trip to the Beach," Once you've selected a beach, consider the price, how far it is, and how much gas it'll take you to get there. Also, decide how long you plan to stay at the beach, and whether it'll be overnight or not.;
, Make sure you'll have enough time to get to the beach in order to arrive on the date you have planned. Also, know when you're planning to leave the beach and get home.

, This way, you know you'll have a room waiting for you when you get there, and you won't have to search for another place to stay if you find that there are no rooms left upon your arrival.

, Suggested items are:

Sunscreen






Beach towel(s)






Hat






Umbrella






Sunglasses






Extra change of clothes (including underwear)






Sandals or flip-flops






Swimsuit






A bucket and shovel for building sandcastles (perfect if you have kids)






Water






Food






If you're planning to stay overnight, you might want to pack items needed for washing up. Also, depending on how long you're planning to stay, you might need more than one change of clothes and other additional items.

, Check off each item to make sure they're all there before storing it all in your suitcase. Be sure you aren't packing too much or too little, and remove any unneeded items if you find that you have too much luggage.


If you have kids, it'd be a good idea to help them pack in case they forget something they need.
If you have a spouse, make sure he/she is packed up as well, but they won't need the supervision you might have to give your kids (if you have any).

, It's recommended that you bring a GPS and a map to help you find your way to the beach without getting lost, as trips can sometimes get stressful when you're lost! Don't forget to bring a cell phone in case you have car problems.

, If not, simply lay out your beach items and bask in the sun! Make sure to put on plenty of sunscreen to eliminate sunburn or too much tan.


It's not recommended you get a tan, as it will make your skin wrinkly and old as you age. If you like tans, it's best to get it done by a professional in the spa instead of doing it in the sun, as the rays can be harmful.

, On the day you are planning to leave, check out of the hotel or motel room if you stayed in one and make sure you haven't left anything behind before packing everything in the car again. Drive home, using the GPS and/or map for guidance, and unload everything once you've arrived home.

Apply sunscreen.,
Bring sun hats for everyone.,
Set up a sun shade.",How to Survive the Beach1," It is best to put on sunscreen every hour, you will get a nice tan without burning. To help you remember, you could set a timer on your phone. Apply sunscreen as soon as you get there. Use your Sun Screen as directed on the packaging. Sand and water can make Sun Screen less effective. Be sure to consider this. Obviously, the beach isn't exclusively a hot weather destination. You can skip the sun block if it's the middle of winter, unless you live somewhere that has high levels of UV Sun light all year round.;
, Having the sun constantly shining down on your head can make you feel really ill and lead to heat stroke or sun stroke. Again, not required on a cold, but sunny, bracing winter beach walk.

Bring a bucket and spade.,
Take a bodyboard if you like.,
Play ball games.,
Read.",How to Survive the Beach2," Sand is one of the most fun things to play with. You could make sandcastles, dig a tunnel or even just make a hole. Don't bother if the beach is shingle or pebble.


You could bring a few water bottles to wash the sand off when you're done playing in the sand. Stand on a towel or body board to keep your feet clean while you do it. Many beaches have taps to rinse feet, bags, paws or anything else Sandy off. Use these if they are available.

, It's great fun to ride the waves back to the beach.

Have bottles of water.,
Bring a float.,
Know how to deal with riptides.,
Swim between the flags!,
Be aware of any dangers in the water.,
Keep an eye open for thieves.,
Check the tide table.",How to Survive the Beach3," Have them easily accessible for when you get sunscreen or salt water in your eyes.

, These are actually very important, especially for little kids. The reason for this is riptides. If your child gets stuck in a riptide it would be nice to have a float with them to keep them safe, body boards are good for this as well, especially because some have straps. If your child did not have a float and got stuck in a rip tide they would have to tread water which can be exhausting.

, The best way is to not fight the riptide and to let it pull you away, so you don't get exhausted from fighting it. When the riptide is no longer pulling you any more, swim side ways, parallel from the beach, and then go back to the shore, so you know you are clear of the riptide. If you are caught in a riptide make sure to let someone know by yelling, splashing ect. Make sure you go over safety rules like this before anyone enters the water. For more information on riptides go to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4peeulD5vSU

, If there are any flags designating safe swimming areas or separating swimmers from jet ski riders, surfers etc, obey them! Pay attention to directions given by life guards if there are any.

, Jelly fish, sewage, sharks, puffer fish, sting rays, oil tankers, cross channel ferries, sharp rocks, shopping trolleys and many other things in the sea can harm or kill you. Be sure you know what's there and know how to deal with these if you do encounter them.

, Sadly, popular tourist beaches can be a target for thieves and pickpockets. Keep your valuables safe, especially when swimming.

, People drown every year when the tide on a beach turns on them unexpectedly. Make sure you know of any risks associated with the tide coming in on any beach you visit.

, Are there nests to observe or evidence of animal activity (beaver damage to trees along a riverbank for example)?

, Will the weather impact slipperiness of trails? Is there a more comfortable, safer alternate?

, Provide your group with a brief explanation of the planned walk. Give out maps if relevant. Point out comfort facilities; it is a good idea to suggest a rest stop before heading off. If you have any heavy props to show, this is a good time to do it (to avoid carrying them, or forgetting them at the end of the walk).

, This way they can get to feel comfortable around one another quickly.

, You can then tailor the hike as much as possible to their interests.

, You may actually be able to help them face their fears if you show them how to correctly handle the animals. At the very least, provide appropriate reassurances as to the group's safety.

, Engage them by pointing out a few things and then let them take it from there. Be open to questions.

, Ensure that all your other carry items are with you, such as demonstration props, and essentials such as First Aid, maps, two-way radio, water, snacks, etc. When it's time to set off on the walk - either lead the way or point the way where appropriate.

, When you make your stop to wait for the group to catch up, adjust your position so that you are positioned in the middle of the group. With you at the middle of the group, the whole group has a better chance of hearing your talk and seeing any activity.

, If you're leading without others, take a head count and silently add up the numbers at regular intervals. If you're lucky enough to be a leader with a few sweepers, use the sweepers to check if everyone has arrived at a stop. One of the sweepers can always be elected to return to base if needed, without disrupting the whole group. If you have a very large group that feels unwieldy in terms of managing, it might be better to break this large group into smaller groups, making sure to keep people with their family/friend groupings.

, When you have a group of mixed fitness, interest levels, and stamina, it is best to make stops short and frequent, so as to maintain the group's attention.

,, Depending on the length of the walk, drink and refreshment breaks will also need to be considered. Find clean, dry, sturdy logs, mossy or grass patches, etc. to sit on for a rest where needed.

,, Ensure that it includes conservation messages that draw on what the group has seen, so that their experience informs them about the future opportunities for stewardship that they might be able to participate in directly too.

, Use teachable moments so that your group will understand the concepts and practices that will keep the area pristine so that other visitors may enjoy the area as much as they do.

Consider redecoration or renovation; perhaps even a move.,
Rejuvenate your energy levels.,
Consider getting a makeover.,
Smile and take time to notice the changes around you.",How to Enjoy Spring1," The beginning of spring is the best time to plan how you'll enjoy the rest of spring. Whether it's gardening, spring cleaning, learning something new, having a makeover, organizing renovations, or another activity suited to a season of renewal, planning for it will help you to make the most of the spring months.


Spring is the ideal time to set the pace for the coming warm months, including any transitions or transformations you're hoping to make.
If you want to take a summer vacation, start planning for it now if you haven't already started.;
, This age-old tradition of clearing away the cobwebs of winter will give your house a fresh beginning for the warmer months ahead and make the house and surrounds more inviting and enjoyable for you and your family and friends.


Spring is a great time to do thorough cleaning because many of us have pent-up energy to expend after being cooped up for the winter. Spring cleaning isn't as mundane as routine cleaning because it's about making space, clearing out things, and even redesigning your home.
Check that you have all the cleaning supplies you'll need. Look closely at brooms, brushes, mops, and sponges to see if they're still in good condition or whether its time to replace them.
Have all your cleaning solutions ready. If you're making your own cleaning solutions, check out wikiHow's suggestions under Home cleaning preparations.
Wait for the first few warm days of spring and get started. Clear the trash and clutter, sweep down cobwebs, dust everything, and donate or dispose of anything you don't need in the house anymore.
Don't forget the garage, car, any out-buildings, and garden sheds.
Clean out your computer files and emails. No time like springtime to get rid of your digital mess too! The less cluttered your digital life, the more time you have to enjoy the days of spring.
For more ideas, read How to spring clean.

, This is a good time to sit back and assess the strengths and weaknesses of your current living space and to reach a decision about whether or not it could be improved through a change in decoration styles or additions through decorations.


Redecoration doesn't have to mean the entire house. Perhaps sprucing up your bedroom or your living area will be enough of a new direction for you and/or the family this year.
Renovations can take time to plan and get consent for. The earlier you start thinking about them, the better
If you find your house is too small or big, or that it's not meeting your needs and you don't want to renovate, Spring is usually a good time to place your house on the market and to find a new one.
If you're not sure whether it's better to move or renovate, read How to decide whether to move or renovate to help you make the decision.

, As well as spring cleaning the house, car, and garden, consider spring cleaning your health as well.


Winter is a time of eating more than during the rest of the year and if you've slipped into eating habits that aren't as healthy as they could be, Spring is the time to mend your ways and to begin eating healthy, fresh foods again. Improve your nutrition intake and feel your energy levels soar again.
Spring is a wonderful time to make dietary changes because there are so many delicious baby or young vegetables, salad vegetables and fresh fruits available. Make the most of these foods while they're fresh, as they taste best when young and will enthuse your taste buds to want more!
Eat seasonally and locally. Put your body and appetite on the same seasonal schedule as your local environment -- and help out your local farmers at the same time.Consider detoxing your body. Some people enjoy going on fasts as part of a detox but you should always run going on a fast by your doctor first, just to be sure it's safe for you.
Improve your sleeping schedule. If you've been getting into poor sleeping habits over winter, spring is a good time to fix your sleep schedule to restore your energy. Read How to sleep better for more ideas.

Have a massage, or book yourself into a day spa for a full day of pampering.

, It could be as little as a new hairstyle or as big as a whole wardrobe change but spring is a perfect time to consider personal appearance changes.


Over the winter your hair has been hidden under hats and scarves, and spring might reveal a hairstyle you're just not happy with. Talk to your hairdresser about options that will bring you up-to-date and feeling good about how you're looking again.
Check through your closet. Are your spring clothes in good condition and still wearable or are they looking decidedly old or perhaps even ""last season"" if you're very fashion-conscious? If you're ready to change your wardrobe, spring is the perfect time to do it.Use a short break or a weekend to clear out the closet entirely and to only put back the things you really love wearing. Everything else can go to charity or the rag bag (or pet's bed) and then you have an excuse to do some shopping for a few new items that will blend in well with the clothes you've kept.
Now is an excellent time to discard outdated makeup. Makeup wasn't made to last, so throw out anything that's old, caked up, or obviously in bad condition.
Read the fashion magazines and websites to find out what's in season. You don't have to buy everything; just purchase a few items that will give your current clothing a spring fashion edge. And read How to create a fashionable spring wardrobe for more ideas.

, Listen to the birds sing and nest, look out for animals with their young, and watch the plant life around you emerge, shoot up, and finally start to blossom. The world around you is starting fresh; so can you.


Every week brings subtle changes until suddenly it seems as if spring is in full bloom around you. Set yourself a goal of noticing all the little changes that get spring to this point.

Decide the of day when you'll have your picnic.,
Choose food that tastes great cold.,
Aim for finger food.,
Keep the drinks chilled.,
Bring a picnic blanket.,
Take shade items.,
Don't forget hats and sunscreen.",How to Prepare a Beach Picnic," A beach picnic could be lunchtime or evening. In very hot weather, evening is the best choice as the chances of sunburn will be removed and the warmth of the sand will be pleasant.;
, Beaches are not the best place to be setting up a barbecue, so the best option is to make sure that you select food that tastes wonderful when it is cold and to make sure that the flavours across the meal complement each other well. Some great choices for a beach picnic include:


Spreads and dips with crusty bread
Marinated vegetables
Quiche
Pasta and rice salads
Fruit salad or whole fruit
Slices of cake, cookies or brownies

, This will reduce the need for too many knives, forks and plates. However, you will probably still need serving spoons or forks for some items of food. And don't forget the serviettes - they'll be useful for removing sand as much as food crumbs!

, Take along a cooler to keep drinks chilled for the whole time you are there.

, It is much more pleasant to sit on a picnic blanket than directly on the sand. This will also help keep some sand out of the food, although this is almost inevitable anyway!

, If you have decided to have a daytime beach picnic, always include shade producing items. There is a range of shade furniture that can be taken to the beach, including large umbrellas and shade tents. In some places, a shade tent might also serve as excellent protection against insects.

, For a daytime picnic, these are essential inclusions.

Find a flat water surface with a large supply of rocks.,
Select your rock.,
Place your index finger against the edge of the rock.,
Face the water sideways, with your feet shoulder-width apart.,
Bend your wrist all the way back and then snap it forward to flick the rock against the surface of the water.,
Get your legs into it.,
Make sure to follow through.,
Keep practicing.",How to Skip Rocks," Lake shores or calm areas of rivers are best. Ocean beaches are not your best option, unless it’s a very calm day. However, the calm bay side of a beach, such as parts of Florida’s Gulf Coast, can be just as conducive to rock skipping as a lake. If you do choose to skip stones on rough water, you'll need to adapt your technique to using a slightly heavier stone, which is more likely to plough through a wave and maintain a steady course.Just keep in mind that heavier stones can be more challenging to skip, so you’ll be putting yourself at a slight disadvantage.


If you can’t find a flat water surface with a good supply of rocks, bring a stack of your own. It’ll be harder to get the technique down if you have to spend five minutes searching for a new rock every time you skip a stone.;
, Look for a skinny, flat and round rock about the size of your palm, which is just heavy enough to be immune to breezes and turbulence, but still light enough to be thrown with accuracy.Try to find the thinnest rock possible. The smoother and flatter the stone, the better it will skip across the surface of the water without breaking the surface tension.


However, the world record holder for rock skipping admits that a perfectly round and smooth stone is too slippery to hold; he prefers a stone with a chip or a bump that he can grip so that he can get the most spin.It's also possible that a rock with lots of small pits on the surface reduces water drag in the same way that the many dimples on a golf ball reduce air drag.Try out different kinds of stones and see what works best for you.
If you have rougher, more calloused hands, it may be easier to grip onto a smoother stone. However, if your hands are as soft and smooth as a baby’s, it may be challenging to grip it well before you throw it.

, Hold the flat sides of the rock with your thumb on one side and your middle finger on the other. This is just one way to hold the stone; what matters, ultimately, is that you can send the stone spinning in a straight line with the flat end almost parallel to the water. You should make sure to place the stone in the crook of your index finger while placing your thumb on top of the rock to maintain control of it.









You can also consider the size of your hands when implementing this technique. If you have smaller hands, you may need to use a smaller stone so that you can really get a firm grip on it.

, Stand with your non-dominant side closest to the water's edge, with your shoulder turned toward the water. Squat down close to the water so that when you throw, your rock will be close to parallel with the surface of the water. Scientists have found that the ideal angle between the stone and the water is 20 degrees; any less than that, and the friction slows it down; any more than that, and it cuts the water and sinks.If you're tall, you might find yourself making the angle too wide, in which case you can compensate by throwing the stone faster. Practice getting the stone to hit the water at a 20 degree angle, even if you can’t get it to skip, at first., Don’t think of it as throwing an overhand Frisbee, but as throwing an underhand softball. You can also think of it like cracking a whip sideways. The important thing is that you carefully bend your wrist all the way back to generate some power, and that you then flick it forward quickly and at the right angle, allowing it to spin counter-clockwise. Throw it as fast as you can without losing form. Angle and spin are more important than speed.








The world record holder has been observed to employ a baseball pitcher’s windup with a sidearm release and a strong follow through.

, At first, you can just focus on getting the arm work down, but after you feel like you have a strong sense of how to get the speed, spin, and angle that you’re going for, then you can work on getting your legs into the mix so that you can generate even more power and master the technique. Focusing on your footwork can help you master the rhythm and skills needed to skip rocks to the best of your ability. Here’s what you can try:









Bend down at least half a foot and get some bend in your knees. Then, when you flick that rock forward, you can generate some additional power.
For extra momentum, if you want to be like our world record holder, then you can raise the foot closer to the water about half a foot above the ground, lean more on your back foot as you wind up, and then skip the stone and follow through to land on that front foot. This can also help you generate some additional power. You can think of this as being similar to a pitcher’s wind-up.
Though you may be going barefoot or wearing flip-flops if you’re near a calm ocean or a lake, if you’re really committed, you can consider wearing sneakers. This can help you get a firmer grip on the ground and will keep you from slipping.

, Don’t just throw the rock and stop moving your arm as soon as the stone falls out of it. This will cause it to stop short. Instead, when you bend that wrist back, make sure to whip your throwing arm all the way across your chest, finishing near the shoulder of your opposite arm. Following through will ensure that you’ve put all of your power and momentum into the throw and will make the stone travel the furthest and skip the longest.









Think of it as throwing a baseball or hitting a forehand in tennis. You want to complete the full motion to maximize the results.

, If the stones bounce off the water and go high in the air, you're probably throwing it down too close to yourself (making a wide angle between the stone and the water); try throwing it so the first skip is further away from you.That's because the force of the water pushes the rock up, and with too much force, it goes too far up then comes down at a sharp angle and sinks. If you throw it too far, though, then the stone will ""surf"" across the surface of the water (rather than skip) and the friction will slow the rock's momentum and cause it to sink.









You can also practice skipping stones of different sizes and weights. You may find that you prefer a lighter, smaller stone, or a larger, heavier stone.
If it’s summer and you have some free time on your hands, just practice skipping 20 or so stones a day until you get it. Remember that you’re not trying to be a world record holder and that you’re just trying to have some fun.

Work on your lawn and garden.,
Prepare the vegetable patch.,
Enjoy animals enjoying Spring.,
Capture the Spring scenery.,
Get active.,
Bring the outdoors indoors (and vice versa).",How to Enjoy Spring2," The garden will need some tender loving care after winter to encourage new healthy growth.


Plants differ in what they need at this time of year, so know which plants in your garden need a spring pruning or tidy-up; some may need dividing and now might be a good time to take cuttings.
Have a good look around the garden to see what jobs need doing and to check whether new mulch and compost layers are needed and whether there are weeds to be removed.

Plant flowers. The local gardening center will start to get deliveries of lovely new annuals and perennials in bloom that you can plant straight in the ground, or you can wander in and check out the available flower seeds. Sunflower seeds are a great beginner's flower if you're stuck for ideas.
Think about planting flowers in local community planting events -- a great way to meet others and beautify your local environment.
Don’t forget about your lawn. It may never be as beautiful as your flowers, but it can use some love after a harsh winter as well. Fertilize, reseed, and/or aerate to prepare it for the hot sunshine of July.

, Now is the time to start thinking about your summer harvest. Which vegetables grow well in your area and are great spring or summer crops? Do some reading up of gardening books or ask a green-thumbed neighbor if you need advice.


If your compost has become a big sluggish, give it a good stir and start afresh.
If you are unable or prefer not to maintain a garden yourself, get someone to do the work for you. Just looking at a tidy and happy veggie patch will make you feel good.
If you don't have a garden, you might be able to join a community garden or a start a yard share. Spring is a great time to get involved in shared gardening and you'll meet lots of new friends.

, You aren’t the only one emerging from a long wintry slumber. Signs of life abound outdoors, so soak it in.


Build a birdhouse and/or birdfeeder. Bring those cardinals and blue jays in for a closer look. Or just go to the local pond and feed the ducks your stale bread. Keep an eye out for ducklings.
If you’d rather go to the birds than bring them to you, go birdwatching. Even a beat-up old pair of binoculars will help. Or just take a nature walk and see what you come across.
Take your dog on long walks. All winter, you’ve probably been walking Sparky only long enough for him to do his business. Go further, and see what he discovers. (But watch he doesn’t find a skunk!)
If you really want to maximize your springtime animal viewing, visit the zoo.You’re still outdoors, still exercising, and you’ll see a wide variety of animals responding to Spring. You’ll probably spot some exotic baby animals.

, Sadly, it will be Winter again before you know it, so give yourself some happy reminders of this time of year.


Take your camera when you go walking.Look for signs of Spring emerging everywhere and take photos that you can use for collages, decorations, and photo projects; or, you can just share the marvels of Spring through your photos with people online.
Try painting or drawing ""en plein air"" (the French expression for 'paint outdoors'). You'll be surprised at how much brighter your colors are in the spring sunshine and how many beautiful things there are to paint or sketch nearby. When sketching birds or animals from life, don't expect them to hold a pose - be more of an Impressionist. A painting isn't a photo - capturing the right “feel” is more important than accuracy.

, Yes, you’re doing yardwork and taking walks, but make the most of this time of year -- not too cold, not too hot, just right for an active Goldilocks like you.


Dust off the bicycle and start seeing your neighborhood again from two wheels. Gather some friends and spend the day biking. If you want to explore, bring a phone with a GPS installed in it. You can discover some secret places, and get back home on time!
Take the kids down to the local park or reserve with some balls, rackets, kites, and a picnic basket. Spend an hour or more letting them charge about playing games and finish up with a lunch or dinner meal on a rug.
Enjoy springtime sports like golf or, perhaps the most Spring-y sport, baseball. Watch them, sure, but play them too. Heck, go down to your favorite ball team’s Spring Training and really feel the warmth of the season!
Check out the festivals in your area. There are many festivals and other community events held during springtime, including perhaps cherry blossom or tulip festivals. Find out what's happening in your local area or even where you're prepared to travel to and enjoy the festivities on offer.

, You’ve spent the Winter looking out the window, dreaming of the chance to head back outside without having to pull on layer after layer of clothes. Get out there whenever you can, and when you can’t, bring a little of Spring into your home.


Open the windows.It sounds so simple, but we’ve become so used to climate conditioning that the simple pleasure of a springtime breeze lofting up your drapes and brushing your face is often lost. Take advantage of this time of year when you can give both the furnace and the A/C a rest.
Bring flowers into the house. Spring flowers will bring joy into the house with their bright colors and lovely fragrances. Aim to have new, fresh flowers in the house every week during Spring. Read How to arrange flowers, How to make homemade flower food for cut flowers, and How to stop cut flowers turning smelly for more ideas.
Do indoor tasks outside.Spare the dryer and hang your laundry on the line. Wipe off that old picnic table and have dinner al fresco. Read a novel or even balance the checkbook on a blanket instead of the couch. Feel the sun on your face, smell the blooming flowers, see the world colorizing like it’s the Wizard of Oz, and hear the birds sing. Spring is here and now, and so are you.

Sit back and just observe once in a while.",How to Be an Explorer," This can be a hidden door in your house, the woods, a trail, or just your neighborhood. There are always new things to be found even in the most “normal” of places.


Feeling adventurous? What does the Earth have to offer your explorations? Do you live close to the mountains, the jungle, or a forest? If it's possible, venture into this unmapped territory – just make sure you're prepared for the specific obstacles each different terrain presents!;
, You’ll need a water bottle, some snacks, a notebook and pen, a flashlight, a compass, and whatever else might be useful for your specific trip. More ideas will be listed in the ""Things You'll Need"" section!


Again, each trip calls for different things. If you're going camping for an entire weekend, you'll need camping gear, a tent, and enough food and water. If you're just going for an afternoon, you can travel a lot lighter.
Make sure you wear your backpack correctly – you wouldn't want to hurt your back halfway through exploring! It shouldn’t be too heavy, either. You'll wish you brought less as you carry it around, realizing it's just slowing you down.

, Having a second person will help you feel safer ‘’and’’ you two can help each other – two sets of eyes are twice as powerful (and twice as quick). You may also need another set of hands for climbing trees, being on the lookout, or just to keep track of notes and directions.


Make sure this friend is just as adventurous as you are. Someone who’s afraid of heights, bugs, or just doesn’t want to get their clothes dirty may end up slowing you down!
Three or four people is okay too, but if you're just exploring for fun, you probably don't want too big of a party. When you hit more than four, it becomes a chore getting everyone on the same page.

, Climbing through the woods in your backyard? You’ll want pants and tennis shoes to get through the dirt and to protect your legs from the brush and bramble. Exploring the beach? Bring boots for the sand, and don't forget the sunscreen!


Make sure your friend knows what to wear, too! If they become miserable because they're not prepared, they might blame it on you.

, The last thing you want is to get lost and to turn your adventure into an emergency. You'll also want to see where you’ve been. That way, upon your return, you’ll be able to say exactly where you were and what you saw – and be able to retrace your steps when you want to recreate your awesome experience.


If there is not a map of the area, make your own! It's fun, and makes you feel like a real explorer. You can make your own map of an area that is already mapped on the paper by adding extra details or correcting the map if it is out of date, too.

, It’s a good idea to know what’s normal, what’s not, and to know what signs Mother Nature is giving you. Read up on star constellations, plants, weather signs, and always have a compass going in your head, too. Imagine going into a foreign country for the first time. You'll be a lot better off if you've done your research beforehand!


This is especially important when it comes to things like poison ivy or bear tracks. You need to be able to say “Let’s turn around!” when the timing is right. Exploring can be dangerous, and the more knowledge you have, the better off you’ll be.

, Exploring is more fun when you have more time. If at all possible, pick a spot to call ""exploration headquarters."" If you can go overnight, great! Set up your tent in a nice, firm, even spot of ground away from any visible animal roosts. From there, consider a few of the following activities:


Animal tracking
Plant, animal, and insect identification
Rock and terrain studies
Digging for fossils or old relics

, Knowing you want to be an explorer isn’t enough. You need to know what’s out there that could use exploring. To wrap your head around all the opportunities that await you on our little blue marble, read books about exotic, untapped lands. Study up on your geography and knowledge of other cultures. Talk to other people about their experiences and places they find interesting. The more you know, the more you’ll know exactly what you want to do and the more you’ll be prepared to do it.


Exploring on the professional level isn't just about exploring – it's about finding something to add to the knowledge of the world. You need another idea that you want to work on. Do you want to present research? Write a book? Doing your research will help you refine this idea.

, All that reading and studying isn’t for nothing – now that you have a decent idea of what’s out there, you’ll need to choose where you want to explore. The winter-torn rivers of Siberia? The dusty huts of the Nagas people in southern Africa? What's more, what do you want to do with that project? Is it going to result in new irrigation for African tribes? Or is it going to be a novel on living in Arctic climes?


The more unique and interesting your project, the easier it will be to get started. When the exploration is over, you'll still have this work to complete – and you'll be able to live your travels all over again in completing it.

, Simply put, exploring costs money. Buckets and buckets of money, especially if you’re doing it long-term or need expensive supplies to get whatever it is you’re studying studied. Because of that, you’ll need to find sponsors, media partners, and kind souls to get your project afloat and to give it the validity it needs – when you get back, you want to share your work with others, not just have it be over!


Kickstarter is a great website for this. It is full of people proposing projects just like yours, and people donate money to the causes they believe in. When you're finished, you give them a shout out in your best-selling novel, or get them first in line to your documentary premiere.You’ll need to sell it like it’s all or nothing. You’ll need to display to others your passion and be able to clearly state your vision, why it’s important, and what ground it breaks. The more you believe in your project, the more others will, too.

, Most expeditions are going to be incredibly psychologically and physically taxing. Many explorers start intense workout regimens years before their project starts. That means weight-training, cardio, and changing up your diet. You'll be grateful you did when all is said and done!


Be sure to train in accordance with your project. Will you be climbing trees or mountains? Get that upper arm strength top-notch. Trying to cover miles and miles of barren tundra every day? Start walking, jogging, and running daily. The more prepared you are, the more confident you'll feel during your trip.

, Look into joining the Royal Geographical Society, the Explorers Club, Explorers Connect, Travelers Club and the Long Riders Guild (if you’re a bicyclist, of course) to pad your reputation as an explorer. These groups will not only be potential donors to your future explorations, but they’ll also be full of people that will be invaluable resources down the line.


You'll need to pitch what you're doing to these groups, too, just like you did your sponsors. But by now, you're a pro. So long as they see your professionalism and dedication, you'll be welcome with open arms.

, Most people’s reaction to, “I’m going to spend the next year living on the banks of the Congo river with the pygmy people!” is going to be, to put it lightly, disbelief and critical judgment. They might think you’re insane, and that’s fine – most explorers are a little bit crazy. But they’re definitely never boring!


The old adage that ""they didn't say it would be easy; they said it would be worth it"" definitely rings true here. You are quite literally taking the path less traveled, which plenty of people frown on. Don't let them get you down – this is doable.

, This is a tough path to tread – in fact, you’ll literally be blazing your own trail. To get through all the naysayers, the paperwork, and the nights spent in a tent freezing your limbs off, you’re going to need to believe in yourself and your work, that you’re doing something that matters. Some days it will be the only thing that gets you through.


Surround yourself with positive people to make it easier. Keep your family and friends close in the weeks beforehand to keep up your spirits and to keep the doubt at bay. It's very normal to think, ""What am I getting myself into?!"" but the doubt will fade as soon as you immerse yourself in your work.

, There's no question about it: wherever you go, you're going to be in some serious uncharted area. You'll likely be alone in a type of situation you've never experienced before. How will you manage? With survival skills, of course.


Learn the art of camouflage. In many situations, you'll need to blend in if for nothing else than to keep the wildlife from scurrying away from you so you can study it (in addition to protecting yourself!)
Master how to build a fire. This one is pretty basic: you need heat and you need to cook food (at least to keep up your morale). You can also keep wild animals at bay if need be with fire.
Be able to collect water. If your stash runs out, you'll be in dire straits unless you're able to collect water naturally. Knowing you have this as an option will let you breathe easier.
Learn how to build shelter. To keep away from animals, bugs, and bad weather, you'll need a shelter. It will also be nice to have a place to call home.
Master basic first aid. Whether it's a cut or a broken ankle, you are your own doctor. Master basic first aid, learning when and how certain medications are useful, in addition to learning how to splint or sterilize as need be.

, It doesn’t matter if you’re in your own backyard or paddling through the islands of Papua New Guinea – a good explorer is always on the lookout. If you're not, you'll go through the time spent on your trip not coming back with a thing. This project is all about being attentive.


If you're going with a team, make sure you're utilizing numbers as much as possible. Everyone should have their own area they're covering to make sure no stone goes unturned.

, In exploring, it’s a good idea to have a plan. However, will you stick to that plan? Likely never. When you notice something intriguing that takes you away from it, go for it. It’s sometimes the littlest of things that lead to the biggest adventures.


This is where your mapping and tracking skills will come in handy. When you go off course, you'll need to be able to get yourself back on it. Be sure you leave a trail you can take back, and/or plot your new course on a map as accurately as possible.

, What good is exploring if you come back and can’t fully remember what you’ve seen, heard, and done? You want to keep your memories as vivid as possible – so write it down! You'll need these for the project when you get back.


Make charts, too. They're vivid and more illustrative of what it is you're experiencing – and they're quicker than writing out an essay about every little detail you're seeing. You can also reference these later to look for anomalies and patterns.
Take time out of the day (or night) to do this. You don’t want to constantly have your head stuck in a book – or you might miss exactly what it is you went looking for.

, Take a broken branch on the ground. On the outside, it’s pretty insignificant. But if you actually think about where it came from and how it got there, it can lead you to a number of conclusions. Is a wild animal nearby? Was there a fierce storm recently? Is the tree dying? Take even the smallest things, put them together, and you may find answers.


This trip, in the end, will be about conclusions. You'll need to take everything you've seen and piece it together until it becomes one giant, coherent puzzle (ideally, of course). In piecing it together, you'll be able to see what sticks out and deserves attention.

, In addition to going out there with gusto and taking the world by storm, sometimes you just have to sit back and let it take you by storm. Be still. Observe. What are you starting to notice that you didn't before as the seconds creep by?


Use all of your senses. Think of them one by one. What are you feeling on the bottoms of your feet, on the palms of your hands, and everywhere in between? What can you see, from the ground to the sky? What can you hear in the distance? Smell? Can you taste anything?

Consider a large water resistant tote bag if visiting with family or children, likely you will need several more supplies than you would if you were visiting alone or with a friend.
Don't use your favorite bag. Because you are going to the beach, you will likely get seawater and sand in your space. Make sure to take a bag that you don't mind getting sandy.;
, Choose a bag with compartments and pockets. Since you will be packing several different things in a variety of sizes, having a bag with pockets, can save you time and keep things within easy reach.


Compartments are crucial for separating things that have gotten sandy (like flip flops or towels) from clean things.
If you are a skilled seamstress, you may be able to add pockets to a bag that doesn't have them.
You can also use a purse organizer inside your bag to create extra pockets.

, Since you will likely have a variety of different things in your beach bag, the way you pack them is important in order to get everything to fit. Fold or roll your beach towels and put them at the bottom of your bag.


Save even more space by investing in a lightweight travel towel.
You may also want to place your towel inside your beach blanket, roll it tightly, and slide the roll vertically into your bag so you can slip it out first thing.

, Be sure to bring plenty of insect and sun protection, lip balm, lotion, leave-in conditioner or hair protector, and sunglasses.


Choose a broad spectrum sunscreen of 15 SPF or higher.Follow application instructions on your sunscreen bottle for extended sun exposure.
As a general rule of thumb, apply your sunscreen 30 minutes before you are in the sun, and then reapply the same amount every two hours. Wider or bigger sunglasses will provide better eye protection.Leave your expensive pair of sunglasses at home where they won't be in danger of getting crushed, sandy, or washed away in the waves by accident.
Pack skin care and hygiene products in a plastic bag in case they crack or burst.

, For a day at the beach, you should bring a hat with a wide brim, a clean change of clothes, a bathing suit (unless you choose to wear it to the beach), hair bands and clips, a hairbrush and flip flops.


Roll up your change of clothes and pack it near the bottom of your bag with your towels.
You may want to pack a comfortable sweatshirt or light jacket, too, depending on the weather.
You may also bring an extra swimsuit to change into if you want to stay in a swimsuit and stay dry.

, The average adult requires 8 full glasses of water each day as recommended by doctors everywhere.Remember, when you are laying out in the hot sun, your body needs even more water.


A good tip is to bring a gallon of water and a couple water bottles per person.
Use reusable water bottles to cut down on costs and waste.
You can fill a bottle half way with water and freeze it overnight, this way you will have a cold drink every time you pour water into the bottle over the ice.
Consider using a water bottle with a filter if you plan to refill your bottle at a water fountain.
Use a water bottle with double wall protection to keep your water cold., Even if you know you are going to a beach with many restaurants, it's always a good idea to have extra snacks, especially if traveling with children. Make sure to keep all snacks out of direct sunlight once at the beach. Try bringing:


1 sandwich per person. Try peanut butter and jelly or a banana sandwich if you don't want to worry about refrigeration.Nuts, raisins and small crackers, like Goldfish.
Fruit.
Power bars or granola bars.
You may want to bring a cooler if packing snacks that need to be kept cool.

, It is very difficult to pack these larger items in your beach bag. If you need them for your beach day, you will need to carry them separately or consider renting.


Get on the Internet or make a quick phone call to your vacation rental, resort, or beach town's local municipal center. Ask if there are umbrellas or chairs available for use or rent directly on the beach.
Additionally, you may want to see if such rentals are available at stores near the shore to which you are headed. You'll find beach-equipment stores that offer rents in virtually every American beach town.

, Particularly when visiting with children, a whistle can come in handy when bunches of kids begin roaming the beach. Teach your family the “family whistle” and you’ll be sure to have them back by your side in no time.

, Whether you are visiting with children or not, it is always a good idea to have basic first aid items. Make sure your first aid kit includes:


Band-Aids.
Neosporin.
Benadryl.
Calendula lotion (for sunburned skin).
Pain reliever for kids and adults.

, A tip is to pack sand toys in a soft mesh bag. This way, you can easily shake off any sand after use.

, Having reading material in arms reach is always a good idea. There is no better place to escape than a good book.

, This is always fun, especially when you’re sunbathing with a group of friends.


Waterproof cases are available for virtually every kind of electronic device, from iPhones to Kindles to cameras. It only takes a small amount of water or sand to destroy a gadget.

, Break these out on the beach and play a game or two with friends while relaxing on the sand., If you are a fan of gazing out at the endless horizon, you may enjoy having a pair of binoculars handy.

Bring plenty of water and/or other beverages to keep you hydrated throughout your visit to the beach. Drinks can usually be purchased by a vendor on or near the beach, but they are usually pretty expensive. Bring your own drinks in a cooler to save time and money.Packing a drink or drinks in a small cooler filled with ice will prevent your drink from becoming sandy and warm.
One gallon of water is recommended.;
, Wearing sunscreen is an important part of going to the beach. A lot of direct exposure to the sun can cause severe sunburn, skin damage, and potentially skin cancer later on in life. Avoid the pain and redness of a sunburn by applying at least SPF 30 before going to the beach.Reapply sunscreen every couple of hours, even if it is waterproof.

, The sun can be harsh at the beach. Bring an umbrella to have some shade when the sun gets too much. If you don’t already have an umbrella, one can be purchased at a shop near the beach, or sometimes rented at the beach. Set up the umbrella in an empty spot and place your chair and/or towel underneath it.Make sure to keep an eye on your belongings when you go in the water.

, Life can get too busy to sit down and enjoy a good book or magazine. The beach is a great opportunity to catch up on reading you’ve been wanting to get to. Grab a magazine before you go to the beach, or choose a fun, relaxing “beach read.” Sit underneath your umbrella and enjoy the environment as well as the story.Avoid bringing an expensive and valuable book. It could get damaged by the sand and water.

, Relax on the sand and listen to some of your favorite music. Choose some songs for a playlist before going to the beach. You can make the playlist on your phone or iPod. Make sure to bring a set of earphones.You can bring a portable speaker if you would rather not wear earphones.

, Take a stroll by the water. Enjoy the sand, sea, and everything else at the beach. There’s a lot more to see at the beach other than water and sand. You can also look at the other beachgoers, the birds, seashells, and tide pools.Make sure you keep track of where you parked or came from. It can be easy to get lost on the beach.

, The water is half the fun of the beach. Take a swim, or walk out as far into the water as you are comfortable with. You can also bring a floatation device, or rent a jet ski if you want to venture farther out into the water.Do not go into the water at a time that has been deemed dangerous. Always watch for signs and listen to the lifeguard.

, The beach can get crowded as the day goes on, so it is better to arrive to arrive early to designate a spot. Check when the beach you are going to opens, but 9 a.m. should be a good time to arrive. Set up your area fully before beginning any activities to make sure that you will have enough space., It can be difficult to carry everything needed for a beach day, like balls, refreshments, towels, sunscreen, and speakers. Bringing a wagon that you can easily roll behind you will make it easier to transport everything, especially if you plan to move throughout the day. Choose a wagon with sturdy wheels that can move easily through the sand.The Wonder Wheeler is a popular brand of carts to bring to the beach.

, Having music that everyone can here is a good idea if you will be going to the beach with a group of friends. Bring a radio or a speaker that can hook up to a smartphone or iPod. If you are bringing a speaker, choose a playlist with your friends that everyone can enjoy.Make sure to keep the music at a reasonable volume if other people are around.

, Bring equipment for games that everyone can take part in. You can bring footballs, Frisbees, bocce balls, volleyballs, or any other equipment for a game that can easily be played on the beach. A few other ideas for games are beach mini golf, relay racing, and sand castle building competitions., Pack refreshments that can be shared amongst everyone. Bring large bottles of water, soda, or juice. For food, make sandwiches ahead of time, or any other food that can be eaten easily and shared. You can also bring large bags of chips and crackers for snacks. Clean up after eating and check to make sure nothing is left behind when leaving the beach.If you’re of legal age you can bring adult beverages like beer or wine, as long as you have checked with the rules of the beach first.

, There are a couple of benefits from choosing a spot close to the lifeguard. First, it is good to have a lifeguard near when you have small children so that they can be reached quickly if something grows wrong. It is also good to be near a lifeguard because it is easier for children to remember where you are when a lifeguard station is nearby.Do not choose a spot directly in front of the lifeguard station. The lifeguard needs a clear path to the water and will ask you to move.

, Invest in a small tent that can be easily set up and taken apart. A tent is better than an umbrella if you will be bringing kids to the beach. It provides more shade, and it is a good place for them to nap if they need it. Make sure you find a spot on the beach that a tent can be set up without invading anyone else’s space.The best type of tent to get is one that folds flat and can be zipped up in a case. They are easier to transport this way.

, A treasure hunt is a good way to keep your kids active and entertained. Bury things like golf balls, large shells, or plastic toys in the sand and have them dig for the “treasures.” Bury the items close enough to your location so that you can keep an eye on them and give them clues.Put a bucket in the center of the “treasure” area and have them put the items they uncover into the bucket.

, Building a sand castle is a classic experience at the beach during childhood. Choose a spot where the castle won’t be washed away, dig a well in the sand, and scoop up some sand. Then, add some water to the sand, squeeze the sand until it is compact, and begin building the castle until it is completed.Use a bucket to create shapes for the castle.

, The beach is a great place to fly a kite because it is usually pretty windy. Flying a kite is a great way to keep kids entertained, and it can serve as a fun challenge. If you don’t already have a kite, one can typically be bought at a souvenir shop near the beach. Make sure to choose a spot with plenty of space and keep an eye on your children as they fly the kite.If you already have a kite, test it out before leaving for the beach to make sure it works.

, The beach is fun, but it also provides a rich learning environment for children. Take a walk around the beach and explore the shells, tide pools, plants, and sea life that has washed up on the beach, like starfish. You can make a list of things you would like your children to identify and make a game out of quizzing them on what the names are of things like crabs and seaweed.Make sure to warn your kids not to pick up anything dangerous, like broken shells with sharp edges.

Enjoy it.",How to Build a Big Sandcastle," The first thing to do is get a group of friends or relatives together to help. Try to avoid bringing people who are impatient or overbearing, as they will make it very difficult to work. The best people to bring are creative, strong, and calm people who are good at working in groups.;
, Once you've got your group together, it's time to find a good beach for your sandcastle. You should try to find beaches that don't attract lots of little kids, as they have a tendency to destroy things. Also, make sure your beach has lots of sand, because you're going to need as much as you can get.

, You need to pick a good date if your sandcastle is actually going to become a reality. Weather that could be described as ""dreary"" is best, because it will keep you cool and help your castle stay strong. However, make sure that it isn't going to rain, as this can make building your castle uncomfortable and impossible. Most importantly though, is that everyone in your group needs to be free. Pick a date that works for everyone, and make sure everyone in your group knows that date. Sending out a short email with a date and directions to the beach is always a good way of getting everyone on the same page. Also, figure out who is bringing what. It's always a drag when you get to the beach and realize no one brought any buckets.

, When the big day comes, you should try to get to the beach early. This will give you time to scout out a good place for the castle before the beach gets crowded. Your castle will do best if it's right above the high tide mark, because the sand will be wet but waves won't pose a threat. Also, make sure your sandcastle isn't in anyone's way. Although you make think your recreation of the pyramids is perfect, a lot of people will disagree if it blocks the path to the bathroom. Remember, beaches are for everyone, not just you.

, The most important step when building your castle is to make a strong foundation. Without a solid base, your castle will collapse before you can finish it. To make the foundation, lay a layer of wet sand over the area your castle will cover. Then, pack the sand down. You can do this by patting it with your hands and feet, pounding it with a spade, or even rolling the bucket over it. Repeat this step until you have a good, strong, base that will hold the weight of your castle.

, After your foundation is done, build a pile of sand as big as your castle will be. If you plan on having a six foot tall fortress with an 8x8 base, build a pyramid that big. This is essential if you want a good looking castle, as you'll see in the next step.

, After you have a good sized pile of sand, start carving and moving the sand to look like the castle you want. If you want spires and things like that, this is the time to add them. Remember that the narrower something is, the stronger the sand will have to be. By starting at the top and carving your way down, you won't run the risk of damaging your sculpting with your feet. While working with the sand, keep it moist by spritzing it with a mister bottle. This keeps the sand sticky and makes it easier to work with. Make sure to pack all the sand well, and remember to completely finish the top before moving down. Unless you want to sculpt the whole thing all over again, this is your only chance to add details.

, While carving the castle down, add shells, flowers, and other decorations if you want to. Remember that once you carve a section, you won't be able to get to the section above it, so take it slow and think about what you want to do. Adding dry ice will produce a mist, which can add a lot to the visual impact of your castle. Framing it with a moat can do the same thing.

, Your castle won't last forever, so take some pictures for your friends who couldn't make it. Seeing what you did will often convince more people to join you, allowing for even more impressive sculptures. If people ask questions about it, tell them as much as you can. Keeping a public image as a friendly, knowledgeable person who cares about their work can deter others from damaging your castle.

Plan your moat carefully.",How to Build a Sand Castle," You could happily spend an afternoon building a city on the beach. If the tide is on its way in, sit down near the tide line, the wet sand farthest from the water.;
, Sand castles have just two ingredients: sand and water. For easy access to the second, dig a hole within arm's reach of where you want to build. Dig straight down until water pools at the bottom of the hole.You can skip this step if the sand is wet enough to mold on its own.

, Drop a handful of sand in a bucket of clear water. If the liquid looks murky or dirty, the sand has too much clay. It's much easier to build with fine, clean sand that leaves the water clear.The best sand for building is so fine it feels like a powder, and has grains with many rough edges.Most beach sand is too smooth to build truly giant sculptures, so don't feel bad if you miss out on the world record.

, Surprisingly, the strongest mix you can make is only 1% water and 99% sand. This is just enough water to cling to the grains of sand, forming ""bridges"" between the grains of sand to lock them together.But you don't have to get out the eyedropper — for a day at the beach, just mix until you can roll a ball of sand in your hand without it crumbling., The more you compress the sand, the stronger it is. The best tools for the job are your bare hands. Trying to tamp the sand down with a shovel creates more cracks or loose spots where your castle could fall apart.Professional sand sculptors compact their sand in wooden frames, with no top or bottom.A bucket doesn't work for this because the sand gets stuck to the base. Listen for a ""plop"" or sucking sound when you empty tightly packed sand from a bucket — that's the sound of your hard work falling apart again.

, A sturdy, wide platform is a big help when you're trying to build a tall castle. Make a flat surface of wet sand larger than you think you need. Compress it by pushing it with your hands or stepping on it with bare feet.


The perfect sculpture can get as tall as 2.5 meters (8.2 feet) on a base just 20 centimeters (8 inches) across., Don't try to make the base of your castle perfect from the beginning. Get the general shape you want first, even if it's just a big pile. Do this by stacking big handfuls of wet sand. Place them as gently as you can, without slapping or squeezing.Stop when the pile starts slumping or tipping over — you can always add more later.


This can be much wetter than the sand you used for the base, as long as it mostly sticks together.
If building a tower, lower your hand from above onto the heap. If building walls, place each handful from the side, smoothing out the wall slightly.

, Place your hands gently on either side of the top of your heap. Very gently wiggle your hands back and forth to vibrate the sand. This will send the extra water dribbling down through the sand below. The sand left behind will settle into a dense, firm shape.Stop jiggling if you see any cracks appear.

, Mold the top of your castle into the shapes of towers, buttresses, or anything you like. As you move down, jiggle the sand again wherever it feels loose or extra wet.


Check out the ideas below for forming specific castle shapes.

, If you see the sand drying out and crumbling, pour on a handful of water and pat it together again. It's safer to add too much water than too little, since the extra water will drain out over time.


Bring along a spray bottle so you can quickly wet the castle surface as you sculpt.

, The fastest way to build tall towers is with a stack of wet ""sand pancakes."" Mix together a large double handful of sand with almost as much water. Plop it down on the beach in a circle at least 20 cm (8 in) wide. Flatten the top a little. Working as quickly as possible, stack three or four more ""pancakes,"" each one slightly smaller than the one below it. Once you get this high, stack even smaller handfuls gently on top, without trying to flatten them. Smooth out the walls of the tower before they dry.


Jiggle the sand between cupped hands as you go to help the sand settle.

, You can build these in almost the same way as towers. Just form roughly square ""bricks"" of wet sand. Set them on top of each other gently, shaping and jiggling the sides to settle them into a flat shape.Your walls will be more sturdy if you start building them against a finished tower.

, The easiest way to build an arch is to build two towers quite close together, leaning slightly inward as they go higher. As soon as the towers are close enough together, make a bridge between the tower tops with your hand. Pile more wet sand over your hand to connect the two towers, and wait a few seconds for it to dry. Heavy arches are more likely to collapse, so scrape off as much sand as you can from the sides and top before you move your hand away.Professional sand sculptors can connect towers quite far apart, just inserting a bridge of sand between them and smoothing it out.This is pretty difficult, but if you're up for a challenge, use the same approach recommended earlier for the base of your castle: slightly wet sand, very densely packed.

, A small rake, shovel, pencil, or any other handheld tool can carve into the sand. To make a flat surface, just drag the tool slowly and steadily across the sand.


You can pack sand into funnels, small buckets, or other containers to shape it quickly into different forms. If you can, use containers that have a hole in the base. A solid base tends to stick to the sand, making it hard to force out.
If the sand crumbles when you try to carve it, add more water. If it slumps, let it dry out a little.

, It's always easiest to carve the top of your castle first.If you move from the bottom upward, the falling sand from above will rub out your careful designs.

, If you decide to add a moat, carve the water channels a little distance away from your castle base. Water can seep into the nearby sand and cause your whole castle to slump into the foundation. Make sure there's plenty of space between the moat and castle to avoid this problem.


If water flows down to the moat from higher ground than the castle, make sure it's not directly above your sculpture. Keep it to one side, so the water flowing through the sand doesn't collide with your hard work.

Prepare the equipment.,
Choose refreshing re-hydration drinks over sugary treats.,
Think of healthy, but filling food for your beach trip.,
Assemble an insulated cooler.,
Pack cleaning supplies.,
Relax after lunch.",How to Pack a Lunch for the Beach," Having the right gear with you at the beach will make it a more comfortable and sun-safe experience.


A lot of people aren't so keen to sit and relax on the bare sand, especially not when it's hot or when it risks getting mixed up with the food. Bring a picnic sheet, a beach towel, and maybe even fold-up chairs for relaxing on so that you and your fellow diners can stay off the sand.

Beach umbrellas are an excellent method to block off the sun around your area. Secure the bottom of the handle or spokes, otherwise it may blow away; if it doesn't have something to help you secure it, you can use wet sand for this, or pile bags from your other gear onto the end of it.
Pack all the food and drinks in insulated coolers. Rather than a regular beach bag, backpack, or plastic bags, insulated coolers provide enduring protection from heat and will keep non-perishable items cool until you're ready to enjoy them.;
, Leave all alcohol, sodas, and sugar-loaded juices at home. It might be nice to have a cold soda with your lunch, but it won't feel so good when you've been under the sun for a few hours.



Make lemonade or another citrus-based drink to quench your thirst in the heat.

Pre-freeze water bottles the night before. Always leave a small amount of room from the top for it to expand before adding it to the freezer.
Encourage everyone to bring water. Small children may enjoy having their own disposable cups to drink from throughout the day. Add stickers or draw on the cups before leaving to distinguish which cup belongs to whom.

,


Choose pita bread or wraps instead of bread slices that may get soggy.
Keep all condiments separated from other food. Use small Tupperware containers for sauces, mayonnaise, or dressing.
Pack light and non-salty snacks for kids in individual sealable snack or sandwich bags. Prepare the night before by chopping fresh vegetables, like carrot slices. Non-buttered popcorn, unsalted pretzels, crackers, and raisins can be enjoyed as a small snack mix.
Decide to use Tupperware containers instead of plastic bags to store sandwiches and fragile food in. The last thing you need is a soggy and smashed lunch by the time you want to eat it.
Go with light meats, such as turkey slices or grilled chicken. They are excellent choices to place in a sandwich wrap.
Try to create a meal based upon finger foods. Utensils that are needed for food, such as salads, will be just another thing to take care of while cleaning up, so the less, the better.

,


Make sure that the food and drinks that are going to be used last or not that much goes on the bottom. You don't want to be digging through the ice or other items just to get one thing.
Add the heaviest and biggest items on the bottom, while the lightest and smallest items should be placed on the top.
Always add any ice cubes to the cooler after the items have been added. Ice cubes take a lot of room and you don't want to be digging ice cube holes to place things in.

, Inevitably, sand will get onto things, and there will be food and drink drips and spills. As well, leftover wrappings and containers need to be taken off the beach to leave it in the pristine condition you'd like it to be.



Baby wipes are recommended to take with you to the beach. Unlike napkins, baby wipes help to moisturize the skin and they remove sand more efficiently than dry cloth or paper.
Take extra plastic bags with you. To minimize trash blowing away and litter in general, you can easily dispose your trash in the plastic bag. Toss the entire bag away in a nearby trash barrel on your way out, or have one member of the party dispose of it after lunch if it's very windy and you're concerned it'll blow away.

, Although you don't need to wait to get back into the water (getting cramp after eating is an old myth), it's a good idea to let the food settle a little, although the kids are free to use up their energy as they'd like! Just be sun safe and remember to add more sunscreen, hats, tops, etc., to avoid sunburn.

Put a wide-brimmed hat on their head.",How to Take a Baby to the Beach2," Liberally apply sunscreen on your baby if they are older than six months. Choose a broad-spectrum sunscreen that has at least an SPF of 30.Use a sunscreen that contains zinc oxide or titanium dioxide to avoid irritating your baby’s skin.You can use sunscreen on a baby that is younger than six months, but do not apply is as frequently. Only apply it to exposed skin, and try to keep their arms, legs, feet, and face protected from the sun with clothing. The chemicals in the sunscreen may irritate their sensitive skin.Don’t use products that contain insect repellent., Sunscreen can wear off after a few hours, so be sure to reapply it every two hours. If your baby has been in the water or has been perspiring, apply the sunscreen more frequently., The sun’s ultraviolet rays are the strongest and can do the most damage between 10 AM and 4 PM. During this time, keep your baby in the shade as much as possible, or plan to visit the beach outside of these hours., Make sure your baby’s arms and legs are completely covered to protect them from the sun’s harmful rays. Dress them in lightweight, light-colored clothing. Lighter colors like white, yellow, or light blue will help reflect the heat to keep your baby’s skin cooler.


Opt for fabrics that have a tighter weave that will keep the sun from penetrating the clothing. Hold your baby’s clothes up to a light. The tighter the weave, the less light will shine through it.
Look for swimsuits or clothes that have sun protection built-in to the fabric., It is important to keep your baby’s head covered during a day at the beach. Even if they have hair, the top of their head can still burn.Use a wide-brimmed hat to protect their heads and shield their eyes from the sun’s glare.

Keep them at an arm’s length at all times.,
Stay in the shallow water.,
Hold your baby securely while in the water.",How to Take a Baby to the Beach3," It is not recommended for babies under two months old to swim in lakes, rivers, pools, or oceans. A baby’s immune system is very vulnerable during this time, and contaminated water may make them more likely to become sick.To keep your newborn safe, keep them away from ocean water until they are over two months old.

, It is difficult for babies to regulate their body temperature, so be sure to check the water before your baby goes in. Use your best judgment to gauge the water’s temperature. If the water seems quite cold to you, then it will feel very cold to your baby.Take your baby out of the water if they begin to shiver or if their lips turn blue.
If your baby is too cold, remove the wet swimming gear and wrap them in a warm, dry blanket or towel., Make sure your baby is wearing a flotation device at all times when they are near the water. Although it may be uncomfortable for your child at first, they will get used to it over time.A wave could knock them over as you are holding on to them, or a current could pull them out. Make sure your baby will be able to keep their head above water at all times by placing them in a snug life jacket.


Make sure the life jacket has head support and a strap between the legs. This strap will prevent the jacket from slipping off over the baby’s head., Take your baby down to the tide to wade in a section that is calm and clean. Look to see that there are lifeguards nearby who can help or alert you if there are typically rough currents or waves in that area.Your baby will enjoy watching the gentle tide roll in and will love exploring the new textures in a peaceful wading spot.

, While near the water, make sure you or another adult can easily get to your baby. Make sure they are at an arm’s length away so that they can be easily reached if necessary.

, Even if your baby is taking swimming lessons, it can be dangerous to take them into deeper waters. You cannot see the bottom at many beaches, so it can be difficult to tell if and where the ocean floor drops off. Waves can splash salt water into your baby’s mouth or eyes, causing discomfort. Stay in shallow waters where you can keep your footing., If you take your baby into the water, make sure that you are holding them safely and securely. Waves can be more powerful than they look.Keep a close hold on your child so that the waves do not knock them over or push them under water.

Identify lines of longitude.,
Identify lines of latitude.,
Write the latitude and longitude coordinates.",How to Write Latitude and Longitude1," Lines of longitude are vertical lines that stretch across the globe, moving from the North to South Pole. The Prime Meridian divides lines of longitude. This is the zero degree mark. When writing out lines of longitude, use the symbol ""°"" to indicate degrees.Lines of longitude stretch from east to west. Moving to the east, each line of longitude increases by one degree. You use the letter ""E"" to indicate a line of longitude that falls to the east of the Prime Meridian. For example, a line of longitude could be 30°E.
Moving to the west, lines of longitude also increase by one degree per line. You write lines of longitude that fall to the west of the Prime Meridian using the symbol ""W"" to indicate west. For example, a line of longitude could be 15°E.;
, Lines of latitude are horizontal lines dividing the globe. They stretch from east to west, starting at the equator. The equator's line of latitude is marked by 0 degrees. When writing latitude and longitude, use the symbol ""°"" to indicate degrees.As you move north of the equator, lines of latitude increase by one degree until they reach 90 degrees. The 90 degree mark is the North Pole. Lines of latitude above the equator are marked using the letter ""N"" to mean North. For example, a line of latitude could be 15°N.
As you move south of the equator, lines of latitude again increase by a single degree for each line until you reach the 90 degree mark. This is the South Pole. You use the symbol ""S"" to indicate south. For example, a line of latitude could be 30°S.

, Find a location and figure out where the lines of latitude and longitude connect. For example, a location could be found along the latitude line 15°N and the longitude line 30°E. When writing latitude and longitude, write latitude first, followed by a comma, and then longitude.For example, the above lines of latitude and longitude would be written as ""15°N, 30°E.""

Wear open-toe shoes to the beach.,
Wash yourself off underneath the beach shower head.",How to Get Beach Sand off Your Feet1," Sand gets into everything, including your belongings. To avoid carrying the entire beach of sand back home with you, carry mesh products with you to the beach. A mesh bag instead of a traditional duffle or handbag will allow for sand to fall through the open ventilation., Unlike towels, chairs can be dipped in or rinsed off with water. Towels can still be used for warmth or to dry you off, but use chairs to recline on at the beach.

, Although any open toe shoe is a fine option, gravitate toward flip-flops. Flip-flops prevent sand from becoming trapped in your shoes because it falls freely out of your sandals as you walk.

, Beaches provide showers outside of their restrooms on the way to the parking lot to help patrons clean themselves off before hitting the road again. Rinse yourself and your bathing suit as thoroughly as possible, pay special attention to your shoes and feet.


For a more intense rinse session, use the ocean waves at the beach to help you with a pre-rinse wash.
Use the shower head to wash off any toys, buckets, or accessories that might have gotten a little sandy while at the beach.

Identify the lines of latitude and longitude.,
Find the minutes between each line of latitude and longitude.,
Identify the seconds between each minute.,
Write degrees, then minutes, then seconds.",How to Write Latitude and Longitude2," Sometimes, you need to provide a more precise location than broad lines of latitude and longitude. Lines of latitude and longitude can be broken down by minutes and seconds. However, you must decipher the broad lines of latitude and longitude. Find which lines of latitude and longitude a location falls along.For example, say your location falls on the latitude line 15°N and the longitude line 30°E.

, The space between each line of latitude and longitude is divided into one degree. This degree can be further divided into minutes. Imagine there are 60 even minutes separating each line of latitude and longitude. You can find maps online that will help you pinpoint the precise number of minutes your location falls along between each line of latitude or longitude. An apostrophe should be used to indicate the number of minutes between lines.For example, if you find there are 23 minutes between the latitude lines, you would write this as ""23'"".

, Minutes are further divided into intervals of seconds. There are 60 seconds between each minute. Again, an online map can help you identify the precise number of seconds between each minute. A quotation mark is used to indicate the number of seconds.For example, if there are 15 seconds between the minutes in your longitude line, you would write ""15"""".

, After finding the precise coordinates, in seconds and minutes, for your lines of latitude and longitude, write them out in the correct order. Start with your line of latitude, writing the degrees, then the seconds, then the minutes. Then, add the North or South as the direction. Then, write a comma followed by your line of longitude in degrees, then minutes, then seconds. Then, add East or West as the direction.For example, say you have a line of latitude at 15°N, 24 minutes, and 15 seconds. You have a line of latitude at 30°E, 10 minutes, and 3 seconds.
This line of latitude and longitude would be written as, ""15°24'15""N, 30°E10'3"""".

Write out latitude and longitude.",How to Write Latitude and Longitude3," You can also use minutes followed by decimal points to identify latitude and longitude. However, you must again start by identifying the broad lines of latitude and longitude. Figure out where the lines of latitude and longitude meet to pinpoint your location.For example, say your location falls at 15°N, 30°W.

, Some maps identify minutes followed by decimal points rather than minutes followed by seconds. An online map should be able to provide you with the minutes broken down into decimals for each line of latitude and longitude. For example, a line of latitude may be found at 23.0256 minutes., When using the degrees and decimal minutes system, you do not use directions like north, south, east, and west. Instead, you use positive and negative numbers to determine where locations fall on a map.Remember, lines of latitude fall north or south of the equator. When using decimals to indicate latitude and longitude, positive numbers fall north of the equator and negative numbers fall south of the equator. The number 23.456 falls north of the equator, while the number -23.456 falls south.
Lines of longitude fall east or west of the Prime Meridian. Positive numbers fall east of the Prime Meridian, while negative numbers fall west. For example, the number 10.234 falls east of the Prime Meridian while the number -10.234 falls west of the Prime Meridian.

, To write out the full location, start with the line of latitude. Follow this with the coordinates using minutes and decimals. Add a comma and then the line of latitude followed by its minutes and decimals. Remember to use positive and negative numbers to indicate the direction of coordinates. You do not use the degree symbol with this format.For example, a line falls 15°N, 30°W. Identify the number of minutes and decimals and then write out the coordinates.
The above example could be written as, ""15 10.234, 30 -23.456.""

Identify whether numbers are positive or negative.,
Write latitude and longitude, including decimals.",How to Write Latitude and Longitude4," Degrees of latitude and longitude are often broken down by decimals. Rather than minutes and seconds, lines representing one degree are divided to get decimals pinpointing the exact location. First, find the right degrees of latitude and longitude.For example, say your location falls at 15°N, 30°W.

, An online map can break down lines of latitude and longitude using decimal points. Usually, decimal points are made up of five numbers.For example, your location could be 15.23456 north and 30.67890 west.

, Rather than using the words north, south, east, and west to indicate direction, positive or negative numbers are used. For lines of latitude, lines north of the equator are positive while lines south of the equator are negative. For lines of longitude, lines east of the Prime Meridian are positive while lines west of the Prime Meridian are negative.For example, the line of latitude 15.23456 would be north of the equator, while the line -15.23456 would fall south of the equator.
A line of longitude written out 30.67890 would fall east of the equator, while the line -30.67890 would fall west.

, It's simple to use the decimal degrees. You simply write out the line of latitude, including decimals, followed by the line of longitude, including decimals. Use positive or negative numbers to indicate direction.For example, say a line falls 15°N, 30°W. Using the decimal degree system, you could write this as ""15.23456, -30.67890.""

Also take a generous amount of water with you, at least a gallon sized container.If you are traveling to the beach with more people, bring one gallon of water for each person to use for cleansing purposes.

, The basin should not only be on a flat surface, but also on a surface that is not sandy. The goal is to not have to repeat its use once you’ve washed yourself off.

, Make sure there is enough water in the basin that feet are completely submerged underneath the water. Use your hands to douse sandy areas of the skin with water.


In the place of your hands, a clean sponge can be used to help with sand removal.
Be gentle with your skin as you get the sand off. It’s easy to get abrasions if you rub too hard.

The basic field compass, also sometimes called a baseplate compass, features the following simple components you should familiarize yourself with as soon as possible:


The baseplate is the clear, plastic plate on which the compass is embedded.
The direction of travel arrow is the arrow in the baseplate pointing away from the compass.
The compass housing is the clear, plastic circle that houses the magnetized compass needle.
The degree dial is the twistable dial surrounding the compass housing that displays all 360 degrees of the circle.
The magnetic needle is the needle spinning within the compass housing.
The orienting arrow is the non-magnetic arrow within the compass housing.
The orienting lines are the lines within the compass housing that run parallel to the orienting arrow. 
;
, Place the compass flat on your palm and your palm in front of your chest. This is the proper compass stance, when traveling. If you're consulting a map, place the map on a flat surface and place the compass on the map to get a more accurate reading.

, For a quick basic exercise to orient yourself, it's good to find out which direction you're currently facing or traveling. Look at the magnetic needle. It should swing off to one side or another, unless you're facing North.










Turn the degree dial until the orienting arrow lines up with the magnetic arrow, pointing them both North, and then find the general direction you're facing by looking at the direction of travel arrow. If the direction of travel arrow is now between the N and the E, say, you're facing Northeast.

Find where the direction of travel arrow intersects with the degree dial. To take a more accurate reading, look closely at the degree markers on the compass. If it intersects at 23, you're facing 23 degrees Northeast.

, While it might seem confusing that there are two kinds of ""North,"" it's a basic distinction that you can learn quickly, and it's an essential piece of information to learn to use a compass properly.True North or Map North refers to the point at which all longitudinal lines meet on the map, at the North Pole. All maps are laid out the same, with True North at the top of the map. Unfortunately, because of slight variations in the magnetic field, your compass won't point to True North, it'll point to Magnetic North.

Magnetic North refers to the tilt of the magnetic field, about eleven degrees from the tilt of the Earth's axis, making the difference between True North and Magnetic North different by as many as 20 degrees in some places. Depending where you are on the surface of the Earth, you'll have to account for the Magnetic shift to get an accurate reading.
While the difference may seem incidental, traveling just one degree off for the distance of a mile will have you about 100 feet (30.5 m) off track. Think of how off you'll be after ten or twenty miles. It's important to compensate by taking the declination into account. 


, Declination refers to the amount by which North on your map and North on your compass differ at any given point, given the Earth's magnetic field. To make using the compass much easier, you can correct for declination by either adding or subtracting the declination amount from your bearing in degrees, depending on whether you're taking a bearing from a map or from your compass, and whether or not you're in an area with East declination or West declination.









In the US, the line of zero declination runs up through Alabama, Illinois, and Wisconsin, at a slight diagonal. East of that line, declination orients toward the West, meaning that Magnetic North is several degrees West of True North. West of that line, the opposite is true. Find out the declination in the area in which you'll be traveling so you can compensate for it.
Say you take a bearing on your compass in an area with West declination. You'll add the number of degrees necessary to get the correct corresponding bearing on your map. In an area with East declination, you'll subtract.

, When you're hiking around in the woods or in the field, it's good to periodically check your bearings to make sure you're going in the direction you intend. To do this, move the compass until the direction of travel arrow is pointing in the direction you've been traveling and will continue traveling. Unless you’re heading north, the magnetic needle will spin off to one side.









Twist the degree dial until the orienting arrow lines up with the north end of the magnetic needle. Once they're aligned, this will tell you where your direction of travel arrow is pointing.
Take off local magnetic variation by twisting the degree dial the correct number of degrees to the left or right, depending on the declination. See where the direction of travel arrow lines up with the degree dial.

, To do so, simply hold the compass in the proper stance, turn your body until the north end of the magnetic needle once again aligns with the orienting needle, and follow the direction of travel arrow. Check your compass as often as you need to, but be sure not to accidentally twist the degree dial from its current position.








, To accurately follow the direction of travel arrow, look down at the arrow, then focus on a distant object like a tree, telephone pole, or other landmark, and use this as a guide. Don’t focus on anything too distant, like a mountain, as huge objects aren’t precise enough to navigate by accurately. Once you reach each guide point, use your compass to find another.


If visibility is limited and you cannot see any distant objects, use another member of your walking party (if applicable). Stand still, then ask them to walk away from you in the direction indicated by the direction of travel arrow. Call out to them to correct their direction as they walk. When they approach the edge of visibility, ask them to wait until you catch up. Repeat as necessary.


, Place your map on a horizontal surface, then place the compass on the map so that the orienting arrow points to true north on the map. If you know your current position on the map, slide your compass around so that its edge passes through your current position, but its orienting arrow continues to point north.









Draw a line along the compass edge and through your current position. If you maintain this bearing, your path from your current position will be along the line you just drew on your map.

, To find out which direction you need to travel to get somewhere, place the map on a horizontal surface and place your compass on the map. Using the edge of the compass as a ruler, place it so that it creates a line between your current position and where you intend to go.








Rotate the degree dial until the orienting arrow points to true north on the map. This will also align the compass’s orienting lines with the map’s north-south lines. Once the degree dial is in place, put the map away.
In this case, you'll correct for declination by adding the appropriate number of degrees in areas with West declination, and subtracting in areas with East declination. This is the opposite of what you'll do when first taking your bearing from the compass, making this an important distinction.

, Hold the compass horizontally in front of you with the direction of travel arrow pointing away from you. Use this arrow to guide you to your destination. Turn your body until the north end of the magnetic needle is aligned with the orienting needle, and you'll be properly oriented toward the destination on the map.








, One of the most difficult and advanced things you can do with a compass, but one of the most important, is finding out where you are when you don't know your exact location on the map. By locating distinctive landmarks you can see on your map, ideally as widely spread around your field of view as possible, you can get yourself re-oriented.








, Unless the landmark is north of you, the magnetic needle will spin off to one side. Twist the degree dial until the orienting arrow lines up with the north end of the magnetic needle. Once they are aligned, this will tell you where your direction of travel arrow is pointing. Correct for declination, depending on your area.








, Place your map on a horizontal surface and then place the compass on the map so that the orienting arrow points to true north on the map. Then, slide your compass around so that its edge passes through the landmark on the map, while the orienting arrow continues to point north.








, Draw a line along the compass' edge and through your approximate position. This is the first of three lines you will draw to find your position by forming a triangle with the other two landmarks.








Repeat this process for the other two landmarks. When you’re done, you will have three lines that form a triangle on your map. Your position is inside this triangle, the size of which depends on the accuracy of your bearings. More accurate bearings reduce the size of the triangle and, with lots of practice, you may get the lines to intersect at one point.

Determine which zone you are in.,
Determine which datum to use.,
Determine the easting.,
Determine the northing.",How to Read UTM Coordinates,"


The world is divided into 60 UTM zones.;
,


When you are using UTM coordinates, you need to make sure that you are using a common UTM datum. For instance, you should check to make sure or your GPS is set to the same datum as your map or guidebooks or you should make sure that a search party knows what datum you are using for your coordinates.
The reference datums that are most commonly used in North America are NAD 27 CONUS and WGS 84.
Here is how reference datums work. The reference datum is the one place on map from which you measure to all of the other places. Picking a different place to measure from can significantly change the coordinates. If you use different datums in your GPS and on your map, you can end up in the wrong place.

,


The first number in UTM coordinates in called the easting.
The easting refers to how far east you are.
If you are using a map, look at the numbers found along the edge of the map that correspond with the UTM coordinates. The easting coordinates will be found along the top and bottom of the map.
If you are using a GPS, the easting will be the first number when it is set in UTM mode.
A change of 1 number in easting coordinates, for example 510,000 mE to 510,001mE, is a change of about 1 m (1 yard) on the ground. If you walk from 510,000 mE to 511,000 mE without changing your northing, you will have walked approximately 1 km (.62 mi.)
Interpolate easting coordinates on a grid to determine an exact location.

,


The second number in UTM coordinates in called the northing.
The northing refers to how far north you are.
If you are using a map, look at the numbers found along the edge of the map that correspond with the UTM coordinates. The northing coordinates will be found along the right and left of the map.
If you are using a GPS, the northing will be the second number when it is set in UTM mode.
A change of 1 number in northing coordinates, for instance 510,000 mN to 510,001mN, is a change of about 1 m (1 yard) on the ground. If you walk from 850,000 mN to 851,000 mN without changing your easting, you will have walked approximately 1 km (.62 mi.)
Interpolate northing coordinates on a grid to determine an exact location.

Wear hiking or trail shoes however remember that hiking boots are hard to run in. If you are orienteering regularly, you may want to purchase special orienteering or fell running shoes from brands such as Inov8 and VJ Sport. Long-sleeve shirts and pants will help cut down on insect bites.Check local weather conditions before you orienteer. This will help you dress for any potential weather scenarios.;
, You'll need to bring a compass or buy one at registration. A whistle will come in useful if you get lost. Most orienteering events use SI cards or EMIT cards, if you are planning to do lots of orienteering, you may want to buy one but they are normally available for hire at registration. Bring along some water, especially if you'll be running a lot.


You'll be given a map of the course, so don't bring along any maps of the area.

, You'll be asked to specify a skill level. As a beginner, you should start with a white or yellow course. These run about 2 to 3.5 kilometers and usually follow trails.You'll then be given a map of the course, control descriptions, and might be given an electronic punch.


More advanced courses run anywhere from 3.5 to 10 kilometers and are mainly off trail.

, When you start your race, take a moment to look at the topographical map which will consist of a start, a series of control sites connected by lines and numbered in the order they are to be visited, and a finish.


Your start will be a red or pink triangle. Control sites are circles connected by lines. You don't have to strictly follow the lines, but you do need to visit the circles in the order given. The finish is noted by two concentric circles., Your map will have an arrow indicating north. It may also have north lines. These are thin lines over your map that point north. Line your compass arrow with the map's arrow or north lines.


Your map will be topographic. Topographic maps show contours, which shows you the terrain of the course. It also shows vegetation and other less important features than tracks. For example, white is open woods, green is bushy underbrush, orange is open fields, and light brown or tan show paved areas., This is indicated on your map by a circle with a 1. Your control descriptions sheet will also briefly describe the control. These are sometimes called clues. At the control site, you'll see an orange and white control flag.


If you reach the control and find that the description doesn't match the control description, you are probably at the wrong control. For example, if the description states a control is on a post, but you're at a bench, you're at the wrong control.

, When you reach a correct control, you must prove that you were there. The control flag will have a unique plastic punch or an electronic box for you to dib.


It is important to leave the control site right away, because standing next to the control for too long will give away the position to all following runners. You destroy their fun, and could accidentally allow them to catch up to you if you're competing.

, Check your map before moving on to the next site. Make sure your compass is aligned with your map's arrow before continuing on. Visit all the control sites in order.


Take your time when starting out. Running from control sites without relying on your map can cause you to get lost. Once you've gotten the hang of finding control sites, try to increase your speed. As you become more comfortable, you'll be able to go faster and be more competitive.

, Once you've visited all the control sites in order, look for the concentric circles on your map. Use your compass to make sure you're headed in that direction.


If you decide to abort the course, you MUST check out at the finish table. Be aware that otherwise concerned people will spend their night searching for you in the forest!

, Once you have progressed to intermediate or advanced levels, controls will not be visible or reachable from trails alone. You need to think about how you want to find a specific control. Attack points allow you to get close to your control site without giving the location away to your opponents.


An attack point is a point that is easily reachable and identifiable (so you will not err about where you currently are), but is as near as possible to the control you are looking for. For example, an attack point is often on a trail, right at a distinctive bend, or where a vegetation boundary is cut by the trail. It can also be anything else that you can easily identify.

, A catching feature is something that is behind your target control, easily recognizable, and is wide enough so you can't miss it. A typical example is the next trail, but it could be a river, power line, or high ridge. When you hit that catch feature, you know you missed the control, so stop and plan a new attack.

, Make sure you definitely know where you are before moving on. You can travel faster to the attack point.


Your attack point should be a noticeable feature, so you shouldn't need to constantly use your compass to locate it. For example, if a cliff face is your attack point, you should be able to run along your set path and realize when you've reached the cliff face.

, Check with the map to see how far and in what direction to travel from your attack point.


At this point, you should be careful about giving your position (and the control site's position) away to nearby opponents. Avoid simply running from the attack point to the control site.

Lay a piece of paper down on the map and mark it.,
Hold your measurement up to the bar scale.,
Interpret the largest portion of distance from the primary scale.,
Read the extension scale for the smaller numbers.",How to Measure a Straight Line Distance Using a Topo Map1," Place a straight edge of a piece of paper onto your map. Line up the edge with both the first (“point A”) and second (“point B”) points you want to measure the distance between, then make a tick mark on the paper where each point is.Make sure your piece of paper is long enough to make your two tick marks. Note that this method of measuring using a bar scale works better for shorter line distances.
Hold the edge of the paper still on the map and make sure you mark as accurately as possible where the paper lines up to your two points.;
, Locate the bar scale on your topographic map, which is typically found in the lower left. Place your piece of paper with the two tick marks against the bar scale to begin to read the distance indicated. Use this method if you have a short distance between your tick marks that easily fits within the given bar scale.


Note first the ratio that is represented by the bar scale. This indicates that one unit of measurement on the map equals a certain number of units on the ground. For instance, a common topo map might have a 1:100,000 scale, where 1 centimeter equals 1 kilometer; a 1:63,360 scale, where 1 inch equals 1 mile; or a 1:24,000 scale, where 1 inch equals 0.38 mile and 1 centimeter equals 0.24 mile.Note that on the bar scale there is typically a primary scale, which shows whole units increasing from the 0 point, left to right. There is also an extension scale, which shows fractions of a unit increasing from the 0 point, right to left., Align the tick mark on the right side of your paper edge with a whole number in the primary scale of the bar scale. The left tick mark should fall somewhere within the extension scale.


Where you line up your right tick mark on the primary scale will depend on what it takes to fit your left tick mark onto the extension scale. Keep the right tick mark on a whole number.
The whole number you have your right tick mark on indicates that your ground distance is at least as many meters/kilometers/miles as the scale indicates for that number. You will find the rest of the distance more precisely with the extension scale.

, Determine the rest of your measurement in smaller increments using the extension scale of the bar scale. Where your tick mark lands will indicate what tenth of a whole unit will be added to your total measurement.


The segments on the extension scale are typically small rectangles, alternately shaded and unshaded for easy reading. You may also guesstimate at even smaller increments by visually dividing each rectangle into tenths and seeing where the tick mark falls within the rectangle.
For example, on a bar scale that shows 1,000 meters for every inch: If you align your right tick mark on the 3 mark, you have at least 3,000 meters in your measurement. If your left tick mark falls on the rectangle in the extension scale that indicates 900 meters, you have an additional 900 meters in your measurement. If your left tick mark falls right in the middle of the 900 meter rectangle, you could visually divide the rectangle to a tenth of the meter, so you have another 50 meters. Your total measurement would then be 3,950 meters."
"
Mark the edge of a piece of paper.,
Measure the distance with a ruler.,
Calculate the ground distance from the measurement.",How to Measure a Straight Line Distance Using a Topo Map2," Put down the straight edge of a piece of paper onto your map between the two distances you want to measure. Make a tick mark on the paper’s edge to indicate your “point A” and one to indicate your “point B.”


Hold the piece of paper still and evenly against your two points in order to make the most accurate tick marks.
If you want to, you can use a ruler or tape measure straight on the map, and note down the measurement to the smallest fraction of a unit possible.

, Place a ruler or measuring tape up against your piece of paper with the two tick marks and note the distance from one to the other. Use this method when your distance is too large for the bar scale given on the map, or you want to find a precise measurement using numbers.


If measuring with centimeters, find the distance to the nearest millimeter. If using inches, find the distance to the nearest eighth of an inch.
Note the scale given at the bottom of the map. It should show a ratio and a bar scale given by both centimeters and inches, so you can choose which unit to measure by. If one equates to a whole number, like 1 centimeter = 1 mile, you might choose that unit for easiest measuring.

, Use the representative fraction, or ratio, of the map to find the ground distance based on your measurement on the map. Multiply your distance by the scale number.


For example, for a map with a scale of 1:10,000: If you measured 10 centimeters from your Point A to Point B tick marks, you would multiply 10 by 10,000 to get 100,000 centimeters, the true ground distance from Point A to Point B.You can then convert your number to a more relevant distance. 100,000 centimeters equals 1 kilometer, for example, which is about 0.62 miles."
"
Measure a distance that is too long for a bar scale.,
Measure a curved line with straight line segments.,
Calculate distance to a point off the map.",How to Measure a Straight Line Distance Using a Topo Map3," Determine if the distance between your two tick marks is too long to match up to the bar scale. In this case, you can either take several measurements with the bar scale to get the total, or use a ruler or tape measure instead.


To use the bar scale for a longer measurement, place your right tick mark on the farthest number on the primary scale. Make another mark on your paper where the extension scale ends on the left, and note this distance. Use your new mark as your right tick mark and measure using the bar scale as normal. Add this to your previous number to get the total distance.If you are measuring the distance between your tick marks or two points on a map using a ruler that is not long enough, try a tape measure for more length.

, Determine if the route you want to measure has multiple points or takes the shape of a curve rather than a straight line. In this case, take multiple straight line measurements and add them together.


Use a straight-edged piece of paper as usual to mark the distance on the map. Instead of marking straight from point A to point B, measure several straight lines along the curved routes and add them together. Or, keep pivoting the piece of paper from the previous tick mark to make a series of straight line tick marks, then measure from the first and last one on the bar scale.For the greatest accuracy, measure a greater number of smaller straight lines along a curved route., Determine if your map indicates the distance from the edge of the map to another popular destination not shown—like a town, highway or junction. Add this distance to a straight line measurement from your other point to the edge of the map.


First measure the distance between your point A to the edge of the map, using a straight edge piece of paper or a ruler as normal. Then add the distance the marginal information of the map gives to the desired town or highway to get the total distance.
Be sure that your units of measurement are the same before you add the two distances."

Select a clear, zip-close plastic bag for storing your map.,
Lay the map face down on a table or other flat surface.

,
Fold the top edge of the map down to meet the bottom edge.,
Lay the plastic bag flat on the folded map, one edge flush with the folded edge of the map.

,
Move the plastic bag so that its edge extends a half-inch past the folded edge of the map.

,
Hold the plastic bag in place with one hand as you fold the top layer of the map up, creasing it along the near edge of the bag.,
Extract the bag from inside the fold and lay it on top of the new fold, with the edge of the bag overlapping the uppermost fold by a half-inch.

,
Fold the top layer of the map down toward you again, creasing at the far edge of the plastic bag.

,
Extract the plastic bag and set it aside.

,
Fold the uppermost layer of the map up, creasing in line with the crease of the layer directly below.

,
Continue folding the uppermost layer of the map back and forth until it's completely accordion folded.

,
Turn the map over and repeat the accordion-fold process on the other side, using the plastic bag as a guide.",How to Fold and Care for a Topo Map,"


The larger the bag the better, because it'll leave more of the map visible through the bag's surface. You'll be able to read the topo map without taking it out of the bag, which protects it from wet conditions and also provides some protection against abrasion.
Gallon-sized bags are ideal.;
,,


Peek at where the fold sits before you run your thumb lightly along the crease. You can resituate the fold somewhat, if necessary, to avoid running the crease along any critical features you expect to use for navigation.
Don't overdo the crease; the more you crease the paper at the fold, the faster the paper will break down and tear or become harder to read.

,,,


If you struggle with using the plastic bag as a guide for folding, cut a piece of cardboard to about the same size as the plastic bag and use the cardboard as a guide instead.
The folded layer in the middle should be a half-inch shorter than the length of the bag (or cardboard guide). This ensures that the map will fit easily into the bag once it's folded.

,,,,,, Once the entire map is accordion-folded lengthwise, repeat the accordion-fold process widthwise until the topo map folds down into a square that fits inside the plastic bag.

Understand latitude.,
Understand longitude.,
Know the accuracy of your readings.,
Understand how they appear on a map.",How to Determine Latitude and Longitude1," Latitude measures how far a point is north or south of the equator. Since the earth is round, distance from the equator is measured in angular degrees with the equator being 0 degrees and the northernmost point -- the North Pole -- being at 90 degrees. The southernmost point -- the South Pole -- is also at 90 degrees.Latitude is measured in degrees north when in the northern hemisphere and degrees south when in the southern hemisphere.;
, Longitude measures how far a point is east or west of the prime meridian -- arbitrarily set as Greenwich, England. Since the Earth is round, distance from the prime meridian is measured in angular degrees with the prime meridian being at 0 degrees longitude. As you move east or west, the longitude measures up to 180 degrees of the prime meridian.180 degrees longitude is known as the international dateline.Longitude is given as degrees east when in the eastern hemisphere and west when in the western hemisphere., Degrees are a large unit of measurement so to get an accurate location, longitude and latitude are divided to the decimal point referred to as decimal degrees. For example, you may see latitude as 35.789 degrees North. Global Position Systems (GPS) often show decimal degrees but printed maps do not.Online topographic maps express longitude and latitude decimal degrees in degrees, minutes and seconds. Each degree equals 60 minutes, while each minute equals 60 seconds. The comparison to time allows for easier subdivision., First, always assume that the top of the map is north.The numbers on the right and left side of a map refer to the latitude. The numbers on the top and bottom of the map are the longitude.Remember how to convert time in order understand a map using decimal degrees as degrees, minutes, and seconds:

15 seconds = one quarter of a minute = 0.25 minutes
30 seconds = half a minute = 0.5 minutes
45 seconds = three quarters of a minute = 0.75 minutes

Use a topological map to display routes.,
Do some planning.,

Draw a neat version.",How to Draw a Map1," A topological map just shows routes from one point to another. It ignores any scale or even the real-life positioning of the locations. Probably the best example is the London Underground map.;
, To draw a topological map, you need to draw a symbol for each location, and a bunch of lines connecting them together (representing the routes between them). You need to plan this out so that you don't end up with a mess of lines. Remember: the position of the objects on the map does not have to correspond to their real-life locations.

, Try sketching it in different ways. It will help you to see what you can change to make it better. Try making the routes different colours to make them stand out, use different symbols for different types of objects, etc.

, This is the version that you will use as the actual map. Try to make it as neat as possible.

Obtain a USGS map.,
Look for the latitude and longitude.,
Find the location.,
Use a map ruler to check the degrees.,
Write your coordinates down.",How to Determine Latitude and Longitude2," A U.S. Geological Survey map is standardized map created by the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program under the U.S. Department of the Interior. You can find these maps at your local libraries or obtain them from surveyors or other commercial dealers., These measurements are often in the corner of the map. Beneath the title you may also notice how far the map covers. For example, a map may say that it's a 7.5 minute map, which means that the area the map shows is 7.5 minutes of latitude and longitude., Depending on the scale of your map, it may take some time to find your location. Note the city, town, or specific point on the map that denotes your current position. Once found, mark your location. The map legend will tell you the scale of the map so that you may quickly estimate distance relative to known landmarks if you do not know the name of your city. This may help you find your location more quickly.


Depending on what you’re trying to locate, make sure you’re using a map with an appropriate scale. If you want to find how far a state is from your own, you would want to use a map of the United States rather than one of the world.

, Measure from your location outwards from the map to the straightest numbered line of latitude or longitude. The map will be divided into both vertical and horizontal lines to represent the measurements of longitude and latitude. The 4 corners of your map will display the coordinates of both the longitude and latitude fully written out. Only the final two digits will be shown for all other points in between.Your map should have the lines of latitude and longitude forming a grid and dividing it into cross sections. A map ruler is easy to use and can be purchased at an outdoor supply store or online. Make sure that your map ruler corresponds to your USGS 1:24,000 scale map series.Measure latitude first. The lines of latitude will be north and south parallels to your location. Place the zero end of your map ruler on the southern parallel. The next parallel to the north should be touched by the 2 ½ minute end. One edge of the ruler will be marked in minutes and seconds while the other edge is decimal minutes. Make sure to use the correct edge that corresponds to the coordinate format of your map. Slide the ruler to the right -- or to the west -- until it touches your location. Mark how much distance is between the southern parallel to your location. Add this to the latitude of the southern parallel to get the latitude of your location.To measure the longitude you must place the ruler diagonally on the west and east meridians with the ends of the 2 ½ minute ruler touching both meridians. The lines of longitude on your map will be the east and west meridians of your location. You must measure diagonally because if you measure horizontally, the ruler extends past the grid because the meridians of longitude grow closer as they move from the equator. Move the ruler vertically until you find your location making sure to keep both ends of the ruler on the meridians at a diagonal. Record where your location is -- in minutes and seconds -- west of the eastern meridian. To find the the longitude of your location, add your measurement to the longitude of the eastern meridian., The standard procedure is to write the latitude first, followed by the longitude, with both written to as many decimals as possible. The more decimals you are able to achieve, the more accurate and precise the location.


When writing down your coordinates, you may format latitude and longitude in three different ways:

Degrees (d.d°) - 49.5000°, -123.5000°
Minutes (d°m.m') - 49°30.0', -123°30.0'
Seconds (d°m's) - 49°30'00""N, 123°30'00""W



When dealing with latitude and longitude, the North - South and East - West designators are removed and replaced with negative values for points south of the equator."

Make sure that it is noon.,
Use a compass to establish north and south.,
Create a quadrant, or cross, using two pieces of wood.,
Align the sighting nails of the quadrant with the sun.,
Use the protractor to measure the small angle between the beam and the plumb line.,
Understand that the time of year plays into the accuracy of your reading.",How to Determine Latitude and Longitude3," Determining the latitude with the sun can only be done when it is at its highest point. Check your watch or you may use the method of creating a quadrant and placing a stick in the ground, at the very southern end of a north-south line. It’s noon as soon as the shadow of the stick crosses the north-south line.Use a plumb line to ensure that the stick is vertical.A plumb line is exactly as it sounds: a line with any type of plumb attached to it. Gravity will ensure that the plumb creates a vertical line.

, You may only set up your measurements knowing north and south. Mark north and south with a line running along the ground. Set up a quadrant with its aiming beam parallel to this line.

, The aiming beam -- or hands of the cross -- should be centered on the support beam-- or body of the cross -- so that it can pivot up and down. There should be 4 nails at the hands of the cross, each only pounded far enough to keep it stable. There should be 2 nails at either end of the face of the cross and 2 nails at either end of the top of the hands of the cross.Center a protractor at the pivot point. Suspend the plumb line also from this pivot point., Once noon, line up the nails on the aiming beam with the sun. Do not look directly at the sun but rather use the shadows of the nails to find the correct position. Move the aiming beam up and down so that the two shadows from the nails move closer together and create a single shadow on the ground., Once the beam is aimed correctly, use the protractor to measure from the vertical plumb line to the portion of the aiming beam closest to it. Keep the horizon at 90 degrees as you make your measurements., Your reading will only be correct in both the spring and autumn equinoxes that fall on March and September 21 respectively. If you are taking measurements around December 21, or midwinter, subtract 23.45 degrees from your reading. In contrast, add 23.45 degrees if you are taking measurements around midsummer, June 21.The measurements are not completely accurate, other than spring and autumn equinox, because of the way the Earth is tilted as it orbits around the sun.While there are complex tables that give you the correct factor to determine your exact latitude and longitude on any given day, accurately estimate based on the date relative to the spring and autumn equinox. For example, if you are measuring at the start of May, which is half-way between the spring -- when the sun is directly above the equator -- and summer equinox -- when the sun is above 23.45 degrees north of the Equator, you would just need to add half of 23.45 degrees -- 11.73 -- to your measurement."

Use your scale to convert the real-life distances into map distances.,

Add a scale indicator.",How to Draw a Map2," A planimetric map is drawn to scale with the objects in the correct positions, but shows no indication of height. Imagine it like flying over the area and taking a photo. If you look at the photo, you can see where everything is in relation to each other, but because it is 2D, you can't see how high up things are.

, Wide area maps usually use 1:25,000 (4cm = 1km) or 1:50,000 (2cm = 1km) or even bigger. A small-scale map may use something like 1:100 (1cm = 1m) or 1:50 (2cm = 1m). Maps of really tiny stuff can use scales such as 10,000:1 (1cm = 1 micron), but you'll probably never need to draw something like this (unless you need to draw a map of a computer chip that does homework, or something similar).

, Having a key makes it easier to put stuff on your map, without having to draw it out in miniature. Some usual symbols include blue lines for rivers, squares for buildings, triangles for hills and mountains, etc.

, As everything is drawn to scale, you need to pick a reference point (usually the middle of the map, or a prominent feature). Imagine it like plotting a graph, you have to have an origin so that you know where the points are meant to go.

, For each object, you need to know it's distance from the reference point and it's bearing (the angle between a line connecting the object to the reference point and a line connecting the reference point to the North Pole. Measured clockwise from North).

, Draw a little compass on the map to show which way it is.

, Say you have an object 6km away, and your scale is 1:50,000. 6km = 6000m = 600,000 cm. 600,000/50,000 = 12. the object should be 12 cm away on the map.

, Say you have an object 6km away at a bearing of 255 degrees. Using the scale, it should be 12cm away from the reference point (see above). As the bearing is 255 degrees, it should be at an angle of 255 degrees clockwise from the North direction (usually towards the top of the map). You may wish to draw a faint pencil line from the reference point towards North. Measure the angles from this line. Remember: bearings are always given as clockwise angles.

, There are three ways of doing this (each example uses a scale of 1:50,000):


Draw a square grid in the background. The lengths of the sides of the squares correspond to some distance, usually one kilometre. Make sure that you write down what this distance is, somewhere on the map. For the example, the squares would be 2cm across.
Draw a scale bar on the map. This is a little bar, usually 1 or 2 cm across, labelled with how long it would be in real life. For the example, a scale bar 1cm long would be labelled 1/2 km.
Write the scale (1:50,000) somewhere on the map. Some maps use a combination of these methods (e.g. the OS maps of Britain use all three).

Label the contour lines.,
Place a dot at the highest points of hills.",How to Draw a Map3," A topographical map is similar to a planimetric map, but it shows the heights of objects above (and below) a chosen reference height, usually assumed to be sea level.

, This will serve as the basis for a topographical map.

, A contour line connects areas of equal height. Make sure that they are well spaced (e.g. every ten metres). Contour lines may not cross over each other. The closer they are together, the steeper the ground is. The only time contour lines are allowed to touch is at a cliff edge, where the height changes very rapidly.

, Don't label every one, you'll be there forever. Usually, only every five or ten lines are labelled.

, Label these dots with the height of the hills.


The picture shows the process of plotting contour lines.

Find your local declination from the NGDC.,
Alternatively, find your declination from a map.,
Find magnetic north with your compass.,
Turn the orienting arrow so it points ahead of you.,
Adjust for declination.",How to Determine True North1," One of the things that can make the difference between true north and magnetic north so difficult for navigators is that the effect on compasses can change over time. This phenomenon is called declination — as the earth's magnetic field fluctuates, the number of degrees by which a compass will be ""off"" from true north will shift accordingly. Thus, to accurately adjust your compass to account for this effect, you'll need a recent declination value for your location.


Luckily, the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) keeps up-to date records of global declination values. At the NGDC website, you can enter your current location to receive the most recent declination value available for your area.;
, Some physical maps will also include declination values for the area displayed in the map. Topographical maps are the most likely to include this information, though it can be in other types of maps as well. If you're considering navigating by map and compass, consider checking your map's legend to see whether the map contains accurate declination data.


Note, of course, that declination changes over time, so old maps can quickly become out of date.For the most accurate values, use the most recently-published map available.

, Once you know how ""off"" your compass is from true north, it's not hard to adjust for this discrepancy. Begin by finding magnetic north. Hold your compass flat and level in front of you. If your compass has a travel arrow (usually a skinny red arrow on the flat lower portion of the compass, point this forward. Watch the motion of the compass needle. When the needle stops moving, note the direction the needle points. This will be the north-south axis.


Most modern compasses have a needle that is half red and half white. In this case, the red end of the needle is the north-pointing end.

, If you're navigating by compass, typically, at this point, you would adjust the compass's bezel to that the direction you're intending to travel is directly in front of you, aligned with the travel arrow. In this case, since we want to find north, we'll turn the bezel so that the ""N"" (and the wide arrow beneath it) is directly in front of us.


Note that this magnetic north, not true north — we still need to adjust for declination.

, Turn your body until the compass's needle is lined up with the orienting arrow on the bezel (and, thus, the travel arrow as well). You are now facing toward magnetic north. To find true north, turn the bezel the same magnitude and direction as your declination value. Most compasses will have degree markers on the bezel to help you do this. Next, line up your needle and your orienting arrow by turning your body again. You should now be facing true north!


For example, let's say that we originally obtained a declination value of 14o E for the area we're in. If we're facing towards magnetic north, we would turn our bezel 14o to the east (clockwise, in this case). Then, we would turn to the left (which is west) to line up the needle with the orienting arrow, leaving us facing at true north (14o west of magnetic north).

Use the motion of the sun.,
Use an analog watch.,
Use the Southern Cross at night.,
Use the moon.",How to Determine True North2," If you don't have a compass, don't worry — it's still possible to find true north by using natural clues. For instance, because the sun rises in the East and sets in the west, it's possible to use this information to get a rough sense for the direction of north. Just after sunrise, keep the sun on your right to face north — just before sunset, keep the sun on your left. At noon, the sun will be directly south, so face away from it to find north.One way to get a ""north"" reading that's a little more accurate is to use a stick as a sort of sundial. Plant a stick or pole that's a few feet high in the ground and mark the tip of its shadow on the ground. Wait about 15 minutes, then mark its new location. Stand with your left foot on the first mark and your right foot on the second. You will be facing more or less towards true north regardless of the declination where you are., One handy trick for finding true north involves using the hands of a non-digital watch. To start, remove your watch and hold it in your hand with the hour hand facing forward. Turn your body so that the hour hand points toward the sun. Find the midway point between your hour hand and the 12 o'clock mark at the top of the watch. This will point along the north-south axis.


For instance, let's say it's 4:00 PM. The midpoint between 4:00 and 12:00 is 2:00, so if we point the hour hand toward the sun, the north-south axis will be a little less than a quarter turn to our left. Since it's in the afternoon and the sun is setting in the west, we can infer that north will be behind us if we face toward the 2:00 marker.
Don't forget to compensate for Daylight Savings Time! If your watch is adjusted for DST, use the 1:00 marking rather than the 12:00 marking and proceed as normal.

, Certain natural organisms (especially plants and trees) can give clues about which direction is north. To be clear, however, these rules are very ""loose"" and will not always work, so most of the time, other methods are preferable. Before are a few examples of what to look for:Moss: May be thicker on the south sides of trees due to more sunlight.
Trees: Bark may be duller-colored and branches may stretch higher toward the sky on the north side due to less sunlight.
Ants: Ant hills may tend to be on the southern side of natural features where the sun is warmer.
Snow: Snow may melt faster on the southern side of trees and rocks where it receives more sunlight.

, It's surprisingly easy to find north at night if you know what you're looking for. Polaris (also called the North Star) is almost perfectly aligned with the earth's North Pole, so if you can find it, you'll know exactly where true north is. There are several ways to find Polaris, but the easiest way is usually to use the Big Dipper — the two stars at the end of the ""spoon"" portion of the constellation point directly to Polaris. Unfortunately, Polaris can’t be seen from the Southern hemisphere, so it's only useful for navigation north of the equator., Like the sun, the moon moves across the sky in an east-west direction. This means that you can use the position of the moon to help orient yourself toward true north at night. Early in the night, keep the moon on your right to face north; late in the night, keep it on your left. When the moon is at its highest point in the sky, it's roughly due south, so face away from it to find north.If the moon is a crescent, you can also mentally draw a line through the horns of its crescent to the horizon to find south, then face away from this to find north. This works best when the moon is high in the sky.

, Because the light from the sun, moon, and stars hit the Southern Hemisphere at a different angle than they hit the Northern Hemisphere, the process of finding north is a little different south of the equator. For instance, while the sun still rises in the east and sets in the west in the Southern Hemisphere, at noon, it is due north, rather than due south.


This means that, while you'll still want to keep the sun on your right just after sunrise and on your left just after sunset to face north, you'll want to face towards it to find north at noon.

, Because the sun sweeps out a northern arc (rather than a southern one) in the Southern Hemisphere, the directions for finding north with a watch are essentially reversed. Point the 12:00 mark on your watch toward the sun, then find the line that marks the halfway point between the 12:00 mark and your hour hand. This represents the north-south axis.


For instance, if it's 6:00 PM, we would get a north-south axis running through the 3:00 and 9:00 markings on our watch. Since it's the evening, we know that the sun is in the western half of the sky. Thus, when we point the 12:00 marking at the sun, the 3:00 will point roughly towards true north.

, The Southern Hemisphere doesn't have a convenient pole star like Polaris to make navigation easy. The closest equivalent is a constellation called the Southern Cross that rotates tightly around the south celestial pole. To estimate due south, find the Southern Cross and draw a line directly down to the horizon. This will be approximately due south, so face away from this to find due north.The easiest way to find the Southern Cross is to use the Pointers — two bright stars in the southern sky that point directly at it. The Pointers can be found in the white, splotchy streak that is the Milky Way, which is often visible in locations with little or no light pollution.

, In the Southern Hemisphere, the moon still travels from east to west, just like the sun. However, at its highest point in the sky, it faces due north, not due south. This means that the directions for navigating with a crescent moon are reversed — the line extending through the horns of the crescent to the horizon will point roughly to the north, rather than to the south.

Slide it down the map to the point.",How to Find UTM Coordinates for a Point on a Physical Map," In this example, you're going to find the UTM coordinates for Fawn Spring.;
, The northing coordinates are vertical. The numbers get bigger as they go up. Use the edge of another piece of paper to mark the edges of the box containing the point you're finding coordinates for. In this scenario, Fawn Spring is between 4730000 and 4731000. Make longer markings for the edges and notate those coordinates. Make shorter marks for the increments in between, but make the midpoint a little longer than the rest.

, Start off with the midpoint. The UTM coordinates are really just big numbers: 4,730,000 and 4,731,000. What's halfway between those two numbers? The difference between them is 1,000 so the halfway point is 4,730,500. There are ten increments in this little grid, so 10,000 divided by 10 is 100. That means each little gridmark adds another 100 to the UTM number.

, Now that you know the numbers for each gridmark, it shouldn't be hard to figure out the northing for your point. In this case, Fawn Spring seems to be right at the 700 mark, so the northing is 4730700N.

, Make your grid...

, Fawn Spring falls between the 600 and 700 marks, so the easting coordinate can be approximated at 10564650E.

For example, if your map's scale is 1:250,000, and the distance from point A to point B is 6 inches (15.2 cm), the total distance is 6 * 250,000 = 1,500,000 inches (3,810,000 cm). One mile is 63,360 inches, so the distance from point A to point B is 1,500,000 ÷ 63,360 = 23.7 miles (1 kilometer is 100,000 cm, so the distance from point A to point B is 3,810,000 ÷ 100,000, or 38.1 km).

, If you're traveling to the next town, this isn't so important. But if you are sailing, flying, or touring long distances, this might be useful.


The latitude refers to the distance in degrees north or south of the equator.
The longitude refers to the distance in degrees east or west of the Greenwich Meridian Line.
Each degree is divided into 60 minutes, with each minute representing a nautical mile (or 1.15 land miles/1.85km). This means that one degree is the equivalent of 60 nautical miles or 69 land miles/111km.
The latitude is represented by the numbers on the side of the map.
The longitude is represented by the numbers at the top and bottom of the map.

Where the latitude and longitude cross at your location is your point of reference.
Latitude and longitude points are often used when there are no landmarks or roads to help determine a location.


Tip: If you have trouble remembering which is which, the longitude lines are ""long."" The diameter of the longitudinal lines is roughly constant, whereas the latitude lines get progressively smaller, the further they are from the equator.

, How high or flat the land is is represented on the map with contour lines. Each line represents a standard height above sea level.


When contour lines are close together, this means that the gradient is steep (the closer together, the steeper the gradient becomes).
When the contour lines are further apart, the gradient is flatter, so the further apart they are located, the flatter the ground on the map.

, Most maps have a legend or key of symbols on the map itself. Get familiar with how your map represents data—that is key to understanding the rest of the map. In general, maps do the following:


Lines in varying sizes, colors, and unbroken or broken lines depict roads, from lanes to freeways and all in between.
Mountains tend to be shown as brown or green, and are height-dependent: darker at the bottom, lighter or white at the top.
Rivers, lakes, the ocean and other water bodies are generally shown in blue.
Forests, woods, parks, golf courses, or other large bodies of trees or green space are usually depicted in green.
Towns and city limits are often shown in a pastel pink or yellow, and the size and boldness of their names indicate relative population size or importance.
Buildings tend to be shown in gray or black colors.

, You have your map and you're ready to use it. Now you need to figure out where you are before you can plot where you're going.


You can do so by matching what you can see in real life with what is on the map. Common features that help identify your location on a map includes road names, landmarks and prominent natural features, like rivers.
If you have a compass, align the map with the direction shown on the compass. Or, use the sun or markers to help you do this.
A good way to find your location if you are unsure is to find two landmarks. For example, if you can see a prominent tower in front of you, and a city at 45 degrees to your left. Find those two landmarks on the map. Align the map so that the point in front of you is at the top of your map, and draw a straight line from that point down. Then draw a line from the diagonal landmark, till it intersects the first landmark. The point that they intersect is roughly your location. Look for closer landmarks to zero in on your position.

, Now it's time to figure out where you want to go.


If you just want to go from one place to another, all you need to do is to plot that single route out.
If there are several places you intend to go to, you may want to plan your route in such a way that you visit all the places in the shortest possible manner. You can do so by going to the nearest places first after which you will go to the further places.

, Some maps, such as a Thomas Guide, have indexes stating the location of certain places on a map. This location could be grid numbers or pages.


Take note of a map's scale so that you can estimate your travel time, and if you are taking longer then you expected, you can stop to recheck your map.
Don't forget to check the map's legend so will know what you are looking at.

, Now that you have figured out where you want to go, plot the route for your first leg of your journey.


Use can also use a pencil, if you don't want to permanently mark up your map.
Travel to the desired spot with the map. Keep tabs of checkpoints along the way—if you miss a turn, you could be seriously off course before you realise it.

From specific park maps to complicated topographical feature maps, you can learn the distinctions and specifics of any variety of map you may come across, so you can understand to use them properly.


Topographical maps are used to display the specific features of terrain, displaying precise elevation and geographical features to scale, as well as longitude and latitude markers. These are the most accurate types of maps, used by backcountry hikers, survivalists, and the military. These will mostly require the use of the compass to use in navigation.Road maps or atlases are detailed maps used to display highways, state roads, and other roads in a given area. Road maps are available for individual towns, or at larger scale for cross-country travel. Road trips are often made lots easier with a road map.
Two-dimensional area and specific purpose maps are used at things like theme parks, trail guides, tours, and other types of events where the exact distance is not as important to understand. A sketched out map to a fishing spot would be an example of this kind of map. While these maps can be quite accurate, they're generally not drawn to scale.;
, In one corner of the map, north and south should be clearly labeled, so you have some basic sense of direction in relation to the map, and you'll be able to orient the map properly. It's hard to know whether you need to make a right or left turn on a road map, for example, if you're reading it incorrectly.

, On detailed maps like road maps and topographical maps, the scale is indicated somewhere in the map key, so you can understand how the distance between points is represented on the map. For instance, 1 inch (2.54 cm) may equal a mile (1.6 km), or some other unit of distance. To understand how far apart two points are, you can measure on the map and then do the calculation to have a sense of how far it is and how long it'll take you to get there., The meanings of color shading, symbols, and other types of images will be included on some maps, and should be identified in a corresponding answer key that matches the marking to the meaning. If, for instance a map is made up of some areas shaded red with a symbol of a wave in it, you might need to check the key to discover that it's the location of an area of beach with high-tide warnings.


Each map will use different symbols in different ways, so it's important to always defer to a key. For example, on many trail maps, a dotted line means a trail is unpaved, while a dotted line on other types of maps might indicate a country border, or some other kind of marker. Always consult the key to interpret different symbols.

, For most maps that you'll use, you only need to do a few things to travel. Locate your position on the map currently by identifying landmarks that you can see and landmarks on the map, and then anticipating your next movements based on those indicators. Using a map involves keeping your head up and looking around just as much as it does reading the lines on the page.


For example, if you can see on a sign that you're 20 miles from Westville, locate Westville on your map and you'll have a rough idea of where you are. If you don't know what direction you're traveling, look at the cities on either side of Westville and pay attention to which one you pass first, so you'll know which direction you're coming from.
If you're using a trail guide or a hiking map, use intersections to get a sense of where you are. If you come to a trailhead of ""West Loop Trail"" and ""Smith Trail,"" find that intersection point on the map and then you'll know where you are. Orient yourself to the map by looking at the direction each trail heads out from your position and choosing your route according to where you want to go.
You can also use a map to plot your route ahead of time and, if your plan is detailed enough, you can keep the map in the glove box. If you need to drive to the airport, you can plot your route and write it out, turn by turn, and keep it on the steering wheel for quick access., More complicated maps generally require the use of a compass to orient yourself properly and understand how to position yourself in relation to the coordinates you find. If you're lost, or you're trying to find your way from one point on a map to another, you need to either find a landmark physically and orient yourself accordingly, use a compass, or use a GPS.



If you've got a GPS, you can also use topographical maps to plot a general route based on your precise coordinates. Use the longitude and latitude markers on the map to try to figure out where you are, read the terrain, and then plot a course to get where you're going.
Even if you have a GPS, it's still much easier to use a compass to quickly and effective gauge where you are in relation to the direction you're traveling. You can easily stay on course by using a compass.

, If you know where you are and need to find out how to get where you want to go, lay your map out flat and place your compass on it, so the orienting arrow of the compass points to true north.


Slide your compass so the edge of the edge passes through your current position, with the orienting arrow pointing due north.
Draw a line along the compass edge, through your current position. If you maintain this bearing, your path from your current position will be along the line you just drew on your map.

, If you're not sure which direction to travel and need to find out, start with the map flat and your compass on it. Draw a line between your current position and where you'd like to go, then rotate the degree dial so the orienting arrow points north. This should align the compass orienting lines with the map's north-south markers.


To travel, hold the compass before you horizontally with the direction of travel arrow pointing away from you. You'll use this arrow to guide your travel.
Turn your body so the north end of the magnetic needle is aligned with the orienting needle, and you'll be pointed in the right direction.

, If you don't know where you are and you're not sure where you need to go to get where you're going, you can figure the general area that you're in by learning to triangulate positioning. This is one of the most essential map skills in survival training. To triangulate your position, start by finding three landmarks on the map that you can see physically.


Aim your direction of travel arrow at one of the landmarks, then orient the compass and the map according to the readings. Take your coordinates to transpose them onto your map, drawing three lines along the flat of the compass plate. This should create a triangle, in which should be your current position. It won't be perfect, but you'll be in the ballpark.

, Many types of navigation maps exist, including hiking, biking and nature trail maps, highway maps, and lake and nautical maps. The most classic and old-fashioned way to plan a road trip or some other excursion is to map it out on a road map.


Preview a day's hike or bike ride through a nature park by examining a map. You may be able to find out how difficult the trail is, the distance you'll be traveling and other sites of interest along the trail.Plan a trip by viewing highway maps. Major highways and county roads are often listed on maps and provide you with many options when traveling.

, Maps can be used to provide key information about a detour or road construction. Departments of transportation use maps with detailed information about construction, detours or road closures so that travelers can be informed about the latest road conditions.

, Maps are often used in zoning and in construction to determine how far things are from one another, and how far apart they should be. Planning and zoning committees regularly use maps to divide districts or plan infrastructure work, and for demonstrating ownership. Deeds and contracts include maps with legal descriptions.


Some maps are used to predict crime activity. Criminal forensics teams use maps to pinpoint crime locations and predict future behavior of suspected criminals.
Indicate political information with maps. Voters are often directed to their appropriate polling locations via precinct maps. Politicians represent constituents based on geographical location, easily represented by maps.
Demonstrate locations of potential projects for the community, such as new parks, parking lots or community centers.

, Meteorologists create maps to demonstrate incoming storms, cold and warm fronts, and temperature changes. Viewers can identify predictions for their areas by looking at the map.

Turn on your GPS.,
Note the number of satellites that are being received.",How to Determine Longitude1," GPS receivers work by noting the position of synchronized communications satellites that broadcast the time.
, The more satellites your GPS receiver picks up, the better job it can do of determining your position.

One satellite: Your position can be anywhere on a circle on Earth’s surface.
Two satellites: Your position can be either of two possible points on Earth’s surface.
Three satellites: Your position, latitude and longitude, can be roughly determined by triangulation.
Four satellites: Your position can be determined with greater accuracy than with only 3 satellites, because the fourth satellite constantly readjusts your GPS receiver’s internal clock. In addition, the fourth satellite lets the GPS determine your altitude."

Identify the Big Dipper.,
Use the pointer stars to find the North Star.,
Locate north.",How to Find Direction Without a Compass1," The Big Dipper is comprised of seven of the sky’s brightest stars, and is found either high or low in the northern sky, depending on the season. It also rotates around the North Star, which is why it’s important when you’re trying to find your direction in the Northern Hemisphere. As long as you’re located no lower than 23.5 degrees north latitude, the constellation is always above the horizon. Four of the stars form the Big Dipper’s bowl, while the other three form a handle.The phrase “spring up and fall down” can help you figure out where to look in the sky for the Big Dipper based on the seasons. In the spring and summer, it’s located high in the sky. On fall and winter nights, you’ll find it lower in the sky, closer to the horizon.;
, Regardless of the season, the two stars that form the outer edge of the Big Dipper’s bowl always point toward the North Star. If you draw an imaginary line from the pointer stars across the sky to the next brightest star, you’ll find the North Star.If you’re having trouble finding the North Star, stretch your arm out completely and spread your fingers. The distance between the the top pointer star and the North Star should be about the same distance as your thumb is from your middle finger.

, Unlike the stars in the Big Dipper constellation, the North Star is always located at fixed point in the sky, which leaves it never more than 1 degree from true north. That means when you’ve identified the North Star in the sky, you know that you’re facing north. From that position, the opposite direction would be south, while east would be to your right and west would be to the left.Using the North Star to find your direction works best on a clear night. If the sky is hazy or there are clouds, you may not be able to easily identify the Big Dipper.
If you’re in an area where mountains, trees, or other objects are blocking the night sky, you may not be able to use the North Star to find your direction either.

Know the location of the Prime Meridian.,
Find a radio station that broadcasts Coordinated Universal Time.,
Find local noon.,
Determine whether your local noon comes before or after UTC noon, and by how much.",How to Determine Longitude2," By an international agreement in 1884, the Prime Meridian is the meridian that passes through Greenwich Observatory in Greenwich, England. Sometimes called the Greenwich Meridian, the Prime Meridian is designated as 0 degrees longitude., Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), formerly called Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), is the time at the Prime Meridian. Its time is broadcast on the hour on designated radio stations. The time signal you are looking to hear is that for noon Universal Time.You will likely have to have a radio that receives shortwave frequencies to receive GMT time broadcasts. One place on the dial that broadcasts UTC is Reykjavik, Iceland, which uses that time without correction for Daylight Saving Time., Local noon is the time at which the sun reaches its highest point in the sky at your location. It may be 12 noon your time, or it may be as much as a half hour before or a half hour after 12 noon by your timepiece.

You can find local noon with the help of two sticks on a north-south line; when the sticks cast a single shadow, that time is local noon. You can also find local noon by repeatedly sighting with a sextant; when the angle of elevation is greatest, it is local noon.
If you are making this observation in an area that observes Daylight Saving Time during the period which it is observed, you will have to convert the time back to Standard Time.

, If you reach local noon before UTC noon is broadcast on the radio, you are east of the Prime Meridian. If UTC noon is broadcast before you reach local noon, you are west of the Prime Meridian.

For each hour difference between local noon and UTC noon, you are 15 degrees away from the Prime Meridian. If you reach local noon 1 hour before you hear the UTC noon broadcast, you are at 15 degrees East longitude.
For each difference of 4 minutes between local noon and UTC noon, you are 1 degree away from the Prime Meridian. If you hear the UTC broadcast 4 minutes before you reach local noon, you are at 1 degree West longitude.
These differences can be added together and subtracted from as necessary to figure your longitude. If you hear the UTC broadcast 52 minutes before you reach local noon, you can first find how many units of 15 degrees you are away from the Prime Meridian. Because 52 minutes is less than 1 hour, you are less than 15 degrees west of the Prime Meridian. Subtracting 52 from 60 (60 minutes in an hour), leaves 8. Each 4 minutes represents 1 degree of longitude, as 4 x 2 = 8, you are 2 degrees east of the meridian for 15 degrees West longitude, or 15 – 2 = 13 degrees West longitude."
"
Set up a local meridian.,
Set up an occulting stick.,
Set up a sighting tube pointing at the stick.,
Wait for the star to disappear behind the stick.,
Wait for the star to reappear from behind the stick.,
Calculate what time the star was directly behind the stick.,
Convert the calculated time (transit time) to degrees.,
Record the date of your observation.,
Count the number of days from January 1, 2000 to the date of your observation.,
Subtract 1.5 from the number of days.,
Convert the number of days elapsed into the number of centuries elapsed.,
Calculate sidereal time for midnight UTC.,
Calculate your longitude.",How to Determine Longitude3," You can do this by using the 2-stick method for finding local noon during the day. This will give you a north-south line (meridian) as a reference point., This stick should be reasonably tall, but no taller than you can comfortably work with. It should be aligned with one of the posts of your local meridian.

The stick is called an occulting stick because it blocks (occults) the light of stars that appear to pass behind it.
The stick should be tall enough that you can observe a star at least 10 degrees (1 fist-breadth) above the north or south horizon but no more than 30 degrees (3 fist-breadths) above the horizon. Suggested stars to observe for this experiment include Altair (the brightest star in Aquila), Antares (the brightest star in Scorpio), Fomalhaut (the brightest star in Piscis Austrinus), Procyon (the brightest star in Canis Minor), Rigel (the second-brightest star in Orion), Sirius (the brightest star in Canis Major), and Spica (the brightest star in Virgo).
The stick should be set up perpendicular to the ground (vertical). You may need to use a plumb line to verify the stick’s position.

, A tube 1 foot (30 cm) long and no more than 2.5 inches (1 cm) in diameter aligned with your meridian will let you focus on a single, bright star passing behind the stick. Mount the tube on a tripod to steady it., Record this time in Universal Time to the nearest second., Record this time also in Universal Time to the nearest second. These two times will help you figure your longitude., To do this, subtract the time of your first observation (when the star went behind the stick) from your second observation (when it reappeared, divide by 2, and then add this to the time of your first observation., To do this, divide the transit time by 24 (24 hours in a day) and multiply by 360 (the number of degrees in a circle).

We’ll represent the transit time with a lower-case ‘’t’’.

, You’ll want the complete date: month, day, and year., You’ll want to find first the number of days in the years from 2000 to the year just before your observation year, then the number of days from January 1 of your observation year to the month and day of your observation.

To find the number of days in the intervening years: Each year not divisible by 4 has 365 days; each year divisible by 4 (a leap year) has 366 days. You may find it easier to count the number of years prior to the year of your observation, multiply by 365, and add 1 for each leap year.
Once you have this figure, simply count the days from January 1 to the month and day. (Some calendars identify each day’s ordinal position within the year; you can also find this information online.)

, This will give the number of days elapsed from January 1, 2000 to when you observed the star pass behind the stick., Divide the number of days elapsed by 36,525, the number of days in a century. The result will be less than 1 until January 1, 2100.

We’ll represent this elapsed time with an uppercase ‘’T’’.

, Sidereal time is expressed as the difference between a given point in the sky relative to the point in the sky representing the vernal (March) equinox.It is normally expressed in hours and minutes, but for the purpose of finding longitude, we need to express it in degrees.

To calculate sidereal time for midnight Universal Time (represented as ϴ0), the formula is ϴ0 = 100.4606 + (36,000.7701 * T).
If the result is larger than 360, subtract 360 to find the sidereal time in degrees.

, To find your longitude (represented by ‘’λ’’), in addition to the sidereal time you just found, you need to know the right ascension of the star (‘’a’’) and its transit time (‘’t’’) you found earlier.

The formula for longitude is λ = ϴ0 - a + (1.0027 * t).
Results will be expressed in degrees west of the Prime Meridian, or West longitude. If you get a result greater than 180, subtract it from 360 to get your longitude in degrees of East longitude.
This longitude will not be completely accurate, as it does not take the precession of Earth’s axes into account, but it will be accurate enough for casual use."

Drive a stick into the ground.,
Place a taller stick behind the first.,
Wait several minutes.",How to Find Direction Without a Compass2," Try to find a stick that is approximately 2-feet long and push it into the ground just enough to secure it so it stands upright. It’s also important to choose a stick that is as straight as possible. Once it’s firmly in the ground, sit or crouch beside the stick so that its tip is at your eye level.If you can’t find a stick that is long enough, tent poles also work well.

, The stick should be approximately 3- to 4-feet long so that its tip stands above the tip of the first stick. From your seated or crouched position, use the tips of both sticks to line up on a bright star in the sky. You may need to move the sticks slightly to line up the star properlyYou’ll know that you have the sticks set up properly if you draw an imaginary line between your eye, the tops of the sticks, and the star.

, You need to give the star some time to “move”. Keep in mind that the star doesn’t actually move; the Earth rotates, which makes the star appear to have moved. The key is to be be patient -- it can take anywhere from 5 minutes to a half hour for you to notice the movement. The way that the star “moves” will help you figure out the direction in the Northern Hemisphere.If the star moves up, you are facing east.
If it moves down, you are facing west.
If it moves right, you are facing south.
If it moves left, you are facing north.
In some cases, the star may appear to move in two direction. For example, it might move up and to the right, which you mean that you’re facing southeast.

Identify whether you’re in the Northern or Southern Hemisphere.,
Locate the crescent moon.,
Draw an imaginary line from the moon’s “horns” to the horizon.",How to Find Direction Without a Compass3," Depending on what hemisphere you’re located in, the crescent moon will help you identify either south or north. The Northern Hemisphere is the portion of the earth that’s north of the equator, while the Southern Hemisphere is comprised of the area below the equator.All of North America and Europe are in the Northern Hemisphere. The northernmost portion of South America, two-thirds of Africa, and most of Asia are also in the Northern Hemisphere.
Australia, Antarctica, the southern third of Africa, approximately 90 percent of South America, and some southern islands off the coast of Asia are in the Southern Hemisphere.

, This method for finding your direction on only works if the moon is in either the waxing crescent or waning crescent phases, which occur approximately seven days in each calendar month. The crescent phases typically occur at the beginning and end of the month.If you’re not sure whether there will be a crescent moon on a given evening, there are a number of online calendars that provide the lunar phases for each month. Just do a search for “moon phases calendar” or “lunar phases calendar.”

, With your gaze fixed firmly on the moon, image a line from the two points of the crescent that tracks all the way down to the bottom of the skyline. If you are in the Northern Hemisphere, the point where the line meets the horizon is roughly south. In the Southern Hemisphere, the point where the line meets the horizon is roughly north.If you are having trouble following the imaginary line down to the horizon, it may help to hold a stick through the tips of the crescent moon as a guide.

Ensure that your watch is accurate.,
Hold the watch watch level with the ground.,
Position the watch based on the hemisphere.",How to Find Direction Without a Compass4," In order for this method to work, you must have an analog watch with hands that is set to the correct time. Verify that your watch is in proper working order, and both hands are moving as they should.You won’t be able to use this method if you have a digital watch because the analog watch’s hour hand is crucial to helping you find your direction.

, It’s best if the watch is also on a level surface. Try taking it off your wrist and placing it so it rests flat against the palm of your hand. You should be holding it in front of you as you would a compass.It’s often easier to hold the watch steady if you use your free hand to support the hand holding the watch from underneath.

, The procedure for finding your direction with the watch differs based on where you are in the world. If you are in the Northern Hemisphere, position the watch so the hour hand points at the sun. In the Southern Hemisphere, hold the watch so the “12” is pointed at the sun.In the Northern Hemisphere, look at where “12” is on your watch with the hour hand pointed at the sun. Find the halfway point between it and the hour hand -- that direction would be south, while the opposite direction would be north.
If you are in the Southern Hemisphere, look at where the hour hand is on your watch with the “12” pointed at the sun. Find the halfway point between it and the “12”-- that direction would be north, while the opposite would be south.
During daylight savings time, which occurs spring through early fall, your direction will be slightly off. To get the correct direction, adjust your watch’s hour hand earlier by one hour to get the most accurate results.

Evaluate the trees for their heaviest side.,
Look for moss on trees.,
Look for the giant barrel cactus in the desert.",How to Find Direction Without a Compass5," Trees are rarely symmetrical, so one side always seems to have more growth than another. Because plants need sunlight to grow, the side that gets the most sunlight will usually appear heavier. In the Northern Hemisphere, the sun spends most its time in the southern part of the sky, so the denser side of the tree will usually be facing south. In the Southern Hemisphere, the heavier portion of the tree usually points north.In order to accurately decide which side of the tree is the heaviest, you should walk all the way around it a few times. If you only look at one or two sides, you may not be able to tell where the tree is most dense.
It’s easiest to use this method with lone trees in an open field. In a wooded area, trees compete for sunlight, so it’s not as obvious which direction they’re growing in.

, In many cases, moss tends to grow on the side of the trees that is most shaded. In the Northern Hemisphere, that means you would usually find moss on the side of the tree that points north. In the Southern Hemisphere, you would typically find moss on the side of the tree that points south.It’s important to keep in mind that other factors can create shady conditions that would encourage moss to grow on a certain side of a tree. Trees that are shaded by other trees in a wooded area and trees that grow on slopes may throw off your direction.

, This cactus, which is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, grows slanted toward the south. That’s because the northern side of the plant is mostly shielded from the sun, so it grows more quickly. If you spot a giant barrel cactus, you’ll know the direction that it’s growing toward is south, so the opposite direction is north.The giant barrel cactus typically grows between 3- and 9-feet, and features spines in a variety of colors, including red, tan, and yellow. Older cacti often produce bright orange or yellow flowers.

Some parks and cycling tracks have distances marked on the ground. A running track could also serve the purpose. Locate such a measuring resource so that you can work out your pacing using the following steps.;
, Double steps has the advantage of being half the number of steps to count!

, Choose a suitable length to check yourself against – 200 meters or 200 yards is a good distance to calculate your pacing fairly accurately.

, When you reach the end, take note of the number and divide it by 2. You will then get the number of steps you take to cover 100 meters or 109 yards.


Somewhere between 55 to 70 double pacing steps is normal for most people. If you are using yards, 60 to 76 double paces is the normal range.

, Calculate your pacing for 100 meters or 109 yards and check to see if it is the same. If it is not the same, average the number to find your usual level of pacing. If needed, you could pace another distance to confirm your pacing.

This will prepare your body for your low-impact workout and minimize the risk for injury.Walk at an easy pace for five to 10 minutes. You can do this outside, in your home, or at a gym.;
, In order to get the most benefit out of this low-impact workout, do each exercise for 20 seconds, followed by 10 seconds of rest before beginning the next move. Do four rounds of this sequence., Planks and pushups are excellent ways to engage your core and other muscles in your arms, legs, and back. “Walking” your body down into a pushup can build strength and flexibility as well as increase your range of motion.Start by bending over your legs. You should feel a light stretch. Place your hands on the ground and “walk” them out until your body is in a plank position. Then lower your chest down to perform the pushup. Push back up into the plank and “walk” your hands back until you’re bending over your legs again.

, A great way to build your strength and cardiovascular fitness is adding a couple of kicks to squats. This move targets your core and leg muscles and helps with balance and mobility.Start in a standing position with your legs about hip-width apart. Gently lower your legs into a squat, making sure to keep your core engaged. Don’t allow your knees to pass your hips as you lower down into your squat.
Press into your legs to lift back up and, as you do this, kick one leg up and out. Do so with control to minimize your risk of overextending your leg. Repeat the squat and kick with the other leg.

, Your thigh, butt, and back muscles are some of the biggest in your body. Doing lateral steps pulls can target these muscles while building strength and endurance.Begin in an easy standing position. Bend slightly at the hips, which will help you do a rowing motion to target your back muscles. As you begin to row your arms, step to one side. Repeat the lateral step pull on the other side.
Contract your muscles as much as you can. Pretending to “work against yourself” can help you get the most out of this move.

, Another great combination for building muscles and cardiovascular endurance is the punch and high knee pull. This move engages your arms, shoulders, thighs, and core muscles.Punch your arms three times and then bring a knee to one elbow, then repeat with the opposite knee and elbow.
Avoid feeling discouraged if you can’t get the moves to flow at first. Working on it is part of the challenge.

, Just like a warm up, a cool down is important. It helps return your body temperature to normal and loosen your muscles. Take a five to 10 minute walk at a gentle pace. Consider adding a few stretches to your cool down if you like., Anyone can do low-impact cardio and reap its benefits; however, low-impact cardio may be an especially great option for individuals with certain limitations or concerns. Consider low-impact cardio exercises if you:Are pregnant
Have injured bones or joints
Have health problems such as arthritis or stress fractures
Are overweight or obese
Don’t enjoy high-impact exercise
Have a spinal injury, There is a wide array of low-impact cardio exercises that you can do indoors and outdoors. Walking is the most popular low-impact workout.Figuring out other options can help you find a low-impact cardio activity you enjoy and can incorporate into regular and fun workouts. Consider doing the following low-impact cardio:Dancing
Bicycling
Swimming
Nordic walking
Yoga
Tai chi
Pilates
Bowling
RowingElliptical trainingStationary boxing or jabs and hooks
Kayaking
Mountain climbers, pushups, lunges, squats, planks
Exercising with kettlebells
Climbing stairs

, It doesn’t matter where you choose to do your low-impact cardio workout. As long as you elevate your heart rate for at least 20 minutes, you can improve your cardiovascular strength, burn calories, and improve your overall fitness.Working out at home can be especially beneficial if you are not mobile or very active and want to improve your health and lift your mood.Try low-impact cardio such as climbing stairs, doing yoga or Pilates, or dancing at home. You don’t need any special equipment and they offer the same benefits as doing a workout at a gym or another outdoor location.
Consider renting, buying, or borrowing DVDs with low-impact cardio workouts. These can be everything from step aerobics to boxing and Pilates.

, Fitness centers offer a variety of potential low-impact exercises. You can do these on your own, with machines, or in a class. Many gyms even have pools, which allow you to swim or do water aerobics. Considering hitting the gym if you find motivation in having others around you, the weather is bad, or you want to participate in classes.Ask for a tour of your gym to see what low-impact activities it offers. Let the staff member know you want to do low-impact cardio.
See what types of classes your gym offers. Most will offer different types of classes that are either high- or low-impact. If you’re not sure what each class entails, ask a staff member which are the best low-impact options.

, Gyms are often a good option for doing low-impact cardio because they have cardio machines. These can help you get an intense workout while keeping the impact low. Adding a few sprints or intervals, when you speed up for 30-second to a minute, can also increase the intensity. The following are some examples of machines on which you can do low-impact cardio:Rowing machine
Elliptical
Treadmill — including race walking or walking on an incline
Stair machine
Stationary bikes
Woodway curve, a treadmill powered by you and not a motorCross country ski machines, If you’re looking for fun and variety in your low-impact cardio workouts, consider trying new activities. This can provide your body alternative challenges that boost your overall fitness and keep you and your muscles from getting bored with the same routine.Switch up your routine with new exercises. You can also change workouts up by adding time or increasing your intensity.
Develop a new workout plan every four to six weeks to keep your muscles and cardiovascular system challenged. This can promote your overall fitness and wellbeing., Every individual should aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise each week. This activity can be low-impact. Developing a workout plan can boost your health and fitness while ensuring that your activities are low-impact. You can also mix moderate and vigorous workouts during the week. Develop a low-impact workout schedule, which you can modify to fit your lifestyle. For example:Sunday: Rest day with an easy walk
Monday: Walking at a 2.0 incline at 3.5mph for 45 minutes
Tuesday: Trail hike for one hour
Wednesday: Climbing stairs for 30 minutes
Thursday: Yoga for one hour
Friday: Rowing for 45 minutes
Saturday: Swimming for one hour

, Before you start your low-impact cardio workout, take a few minutes to warm up your body. This can prepare and minimize stress on your cardiovascular system, joints and muscles, and mind for your workout. Warming up also reduces your risk of injury.Your warmup should ideally be a gentle version of the activity you are about to do. If you are going to take a brisk walk, warm up with an easy five to 10 minute walk before you start your workout. As that time ends, gradually increase your tempo. Warm up for swimming by swimming laps slowly, cycling by riding your bike at an easy pace, or rowing by rowing gently for five to 10 minutes, and so on. This will ensure the right muscles are warmed up and ready to go.

, If you are doing low-impact cardio for a specific reason or simply prefer it to high-impact options, stick with it. You may need to change your intensity or even the activity as your fitness level increases. You may also need to adjust your plan if you are ill and/or feeling fatigued. Sticking to your plan can help you improve your form and maximize your results.Do less intense workouts—such as an easy bike ride— or rest if you are sick. It’s safe to workout if your symptoms are above the neck and include a runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, or a minor sore throat.If you have a fever, fatigue, or widespread muscle aches, give your body a chance to rest until you feel better.
Make a new workout plan if you don’t feel challenged any longer. You may also want to adjust it as your fitness improves. This could be something as simple as switching up your days or allotting a day or two for a new activity.

, Just like a warm up, cooling down is important for workout. It reduces body temperature, can loosen muscles, and boost your overall fitness. Your cool down is the same low-impact cardio activity you do, just at a slower pace and reduced intensity. Most cool downs last five to 10 minutes.Consider adding five to 10 minutes of light stretching as a part of your cool down. This can loosen tight muscles, increase your range of motion, and minimize your risk for injury., Rest is a key part of any workout, even if they are low-impact. It helps your body recover and build endurance and muscle.Take at least one full day of each week to rest. To boost your low-impact cardio efforts, get seven to nine hours of sleep every night.Make sure you rest on days that you feel sick.
Avoid feel guilty if you need to take an extra day off every so often.

Hold the position.,
Lower yourself back down slowly.,
Do around 10 reps. Like any exercise, push yourself a little more each time you do it.",How to Do a Cobra Exercise," You’ll be lying straight out, so make sure you have the room to stretch the full length of your body on the ground. You don’t want to twist your body any way, or else the exercise won’t work properly.


The ground needs to be level as well. An incline will impact the way your muscles work, and either not give you the full benefits of the exercise, or could lead to injury.If you have a yoga mat, laying it out should show if you have enough space.;
, Stretch your body out with your head facing down. Your torso, thighs, and feet should be firmly planted on the floor with the tops of your feet facing downward.


Make sure your toes are pointed straight out. They should stay this way for the whole exercise, which will help strengthen your spine.You do not need to warm up before doing this exercise. Just get to the ground and start.

, You will be using your arms for support when you lift upward. Pull your arms in close to your ribs, and keep your shoulder blades pulled back and down slightly.Bend your elbows to pull your arms up against your body.
Put your hands under your shoulders.

, Once you are in the proper position, focus yourself by slowly inhaling. Close your eyes while you do this. This will help you focus your mind and body before the exercise.As you breathe, feel the stability in your body as it rests on the ground. Think about your pelvis, thighs, and the tops of your feet, imagining them rooted to the ground to help you keep your legs contracted and pulled close together with your glutes squeezed. This can help you keep your feet in place as you raise your upper body.
Exhale gradually and slowly open your eyes.

, This is the key movement in the exercise. Lift your chest off the floor while keeping your neck elongated and the crown of your head lifted. Raise your head and shoulders upward as far as you can go, looking like a cobra ready to strike.

Inhale as you raise your body upward.Focus on using your back muscles to lift your torso off the floor and just use your arms for support.Position the rest of your body properly. Make sure your glutes are firm, but not hardened. Puff your side ribs forward by firming your shoulder blades against your back., Stay up for 15 to 30 seconds, not letting yourself sag or fall back down. Keep yourself elevated and facing forward to keep the muscles contracted and working.Make sure your shoulder blades are pulled back, which will make your chest stick out.Breath slowly while holding yourself up. Taking two to three slow deep breaths, depending on how you feel, will provide a good range of time for staying up., Return your upper body to the floor, bending your elbows and returning to your original position. Move slowly, as you don’t want to strain yourself by flopping back to the floor. A controlled motion is part of the exercise.

Exhale as you lower yourself back to the floor., You don’t need to do this every day, but it is one you can do several times a week.A really good time to do this exercise is after you’ve been sitting for a while. Sitting hurts the natural “S” curve in your back, and the Cobra forces you into this position.

Warm up.,
Stand up straight with your legs shoulder-width apart.,
Pull your right knee into your chest.,
Jump onto your right foot while bringing up your left knee.,
Jump from side to side for 30 to 60 seconds.",How to Do a Heisman1," Do a combination of dynamic stretching and mobility exercises for a span of time between 30 seconds and five minutes. Dynamic stretching is effective at warming up your muscles and lowering the risk for injury while doing the Heisman, since this exercise works your entire core and lower body.


Examples of dynamic stretching and mobility exercises include jumping jacks, jogging in place, and rotating shoulder circles.;
, Keep your legs slightly bent at the knees, but parallel to one another. Allow your arms to hang at your sides while tightening the muscles in your core.


This is your starting position.

, Lean your body to the left and raise your right knee up toward your core and torso. This causes your left leg to support your full body weight.


Simultaneously bend your left arm at the elbow, with your fingers pointing toward your chin. Your right knee should nearly meet the bent elbow of your left arm.Meanwhile, extend your right arm down toward the outside of your right leg. Your body’s pose should look similar to that of the football player displayed on the Heisman trophy.

, Essentially, you're swapping the positions of your left and right sides: you should now be leaning to the right, with your left knee raised up toward your core, your right leg supporting your full weight, your right arm bent at the elbow with fingers pointing toward your chin, and your left arm extended down toward the outside of your left leg.This Heisman, or ""Airborne Heisman,"" is a basic high-knee run modified to include jumps from foot to foot and more arm movement. The result is a tougher workout that builds your core and burns more fat.
Make sure that you don't kick the leg up and lean backwards as you switch sides. The goal is to crunch your core muscles with each knee lift.

, Jump back and forth between your right and left feet, repeating the full movement for between 30 seconds and one minute. The movement should feel and look as if you’re running in place from side to side.Start out slowly, then work your way up to doing the Heisman as fast as you can for optimal fat-burning results.
When starting, you should also keep your movements contained to a comfortable shoulder-width space or slightly wider. If you want to increase the difficulty of this exercise later on, you can do so by extending it out over a wider space.

Warm up.,
Stand with your legs straight and your arms down.,
Bring your right knee to your chest.,
Shuffle three steps to your right.,
Jump while bringing your left knee to your chest.,
Shuffle three steps to your left.,
Repeat for 30 to 60 seconds.",How to Do a Heisman2," If you're at the start of your exercise routine, you'll need to warm up with some dynamic stretching and basic mobility exercises before attempting the Double Heisman. Try doing jumping jacks, jogging in place, or rotating shoulder circles for one to five minutes., Keep your legs slightly bent at the knees, parallel to one another, and shoulder-width apart. Tighten your core, but leave your arms loosely hanging at your sides.


This is your starting position.

, Lean your body to the left while raising your right knee up toward your core muscles. Simultaneously bend your left arm at the elbow, with your fingers pointing toward your chin. Bring your right knee as close to your bent left elbow as comfortably possible.


Your full weight should be on your left leg and your right arm should point down toward the outside of your right leg.
Note that this part of the exercise is the same as the standard Heisman. Since the Double Heisman is essentially an advanced version of the Heisman, it's best to learn the standard version before moving onto this one.

, Drop your right foot back to the ground, then quickly take three shuffling steps to your right. You should not move forward or back, and your feet should not cross over one another.As you shuffle, keep your arms loose and down at your sides.
Note that you can change the number of steps to customize this exercise. Fewer steps will be less of a workout, while more steps will create a more intense workout.

, At the end of your shuffle, hop up on your right foot, bending your right elbow and bringing your left knee up to meet it at your chest. Keep your left arm down at your side.


The transition to this step should also be similar to the original Heisman exercise, including the jump involved with switching feet.
Your body should be a mirror image of your pre-shuffle pose.

, Bring your left foot back to the ground and shuffle back to the left, returning to your original placement. As before, you should only move to the side, and not backward or forward.

, Switch back and forth between your right and left feet, shuffling in between and repeating the full movement, for 30 seconds to one minute.


It's best to start slow and work up to faster speeds to avoid unnecessary strain. You can also add steps or increase the amount of time spent on this exercise for a slightly harder workout.

Warm up.,
Hold a medicine ball in front of your chest.,
Move into a reverse lunge.,
Twist over your front knee.,
Kick the leg up into the Heisman pose.,
Repeat for 30 to 60 seconds on each side.",How to Do a Heisman3," As with the other Heisman forms, this exercise works your entire core and lower body, so dynamic stretching and mobility exercises are an ideal warm-up.


Jumping jacks and jogging in place are two great ways to warm up for this.
No matter what warm-up exercise you choose, try to perform it for 30 seconds to five minutes, especially if you're doing these at the start of your exercise routine., Bend your knees slightly, but keep your legs otherwise straight and parallel to one another. Hold a medicine ball in the center of your chest, with both elbows pointing slightly out and away from your body.


Note that this is your starting position.
Unlike the other Heisman exercises, this version also tests and enhances your balance.

, Take a big step back with your left foot. Extend your left foot as far back as possible, keeping your left leg straight, and bending your right leg at the knee.


Your arms should remain bent and holding the medicine ball in front of your chest.

, Allow your left knee to bend and touch the ground. As it touches the ground, twist your arms, medicine ball, and torso to the right, passing over your front right knee.Your right leg should remain bent and your back should remain upright.

, Stand up and move out of the reverse lunge stance. Do not allow your left leg to touch the ground; instead, bring it up to your chest, bending the left knee and keeping your entire weight on your straightened right leg.


Twist your torso simultaneously so that the medicine ball moves over your front left knee.
You'll normally ease into this position as slowly and comfortably as possible. To turn this into a plyometrics exercise, though, jump up and into the Heisman kick instead of drawing your knee up slowly. This jump should be similar to the jump you practice in the Airborne or Double Heisman, and it will intensify your workout.

, Unlike other Heisman exercises, you won't switch legs in the middle of the exercise. Instead, repeat the ""reverse lunge to Heisman kick"" motion on the same side for a full 30 to 60 seconds.


To work out both sides of your body equally, you should switch sides afterward: reverse lunge, stepping back with your right leg, then kick up into the Heisman pose with your right leg, as well. Make sure to always twist your upper body over your front knee.

Work on your legs early in the week.,
Exercise all of the muscle groups in your arms.,
Strengthen your core.",How to Diversify Your Workout1," Some of your largest muscles are in your legs, and so they need longer to recover than other muscles. Work on your legs early in the week to allow them ample time to recover.Squats are one of the best ways to work on your legs. Perform a simple squat by standing with your legs shoulder-width apart. Then push your butt back and squat, lowering your waist so it's below your knees. Make sure your knees stay pushed out over your toes - don't let them cave in since this can hurt you.
You can also try calf raises. Stand on a platform with just your toes on the platform and the rest of your feet hanging off. Slowly raise your body so that you're standing on your tiptoes. Then lower your body back down until your feet are parallel to the platform. Perform 2 to 3 sets of 15 reps of this move.;
, There are three main muscle groups in your arms: your biceps, triceps, and forearm muscles. When you exercise your arms, make sure you focus on each of the groups.Dumbbell curls are a great way to work your biceps. Hold a dumbbell in each hand, with your arms at your sides and your palms facing outward. In a controlled motion, raise both arms at the elbow, bringing the dumbbells to chest level. Lower the dumbbells, again controlling the motion, until your hands return to your side. Perform 2 to 3 sets of 15 reps each.
A bent-over row will work your triceps. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and bend slightly forward at the waist so that your chest is almost parallel to the floor. Holding a dumbbell in each hand, bring your arms up so that your upper arms are parallel to your body and your forearms are pointing toward the floor. Carefully lift the dumbbells back until your forearms are also parallel to the floor and make a straight line with your triceps. Lower the dumbbells carefully back to start position. Perform 2 to 3 sets of 15 reps each.
A barbell wrist curl will help work your forearms. Kneel at the side of a flat bench, with a barbell on the ground opposite you. Carefully reach down and hold the barbell in your hands, with your palms facing up, your forearms resting on the bench, and your wrists hanging over the side of the bench. Inhale and curl your wrists toward you so that you lift the barbell slightly. Then exhale and lower the barbell. Perform 2 to 3 sets of 15 reps each.

, Your abdominal muscles are a large muscle group and need a lot of work to tire out. You can combine more than one of the moves listed below to really work on your core.

Try a side balance crunch. Begin in a kneeling position, then lean over until your left knee and hand are on the floor and your right knee is lifted off. Extend your right leg until it makes a straight line with the rest of your body. As your bring your right knee up toward your chest, bring your right arm down so your right elbow touches your right knee, all while balancing on your left side. Repeat for your left side, with your right knee and hand on the floor and your left leg and arm performing the crunch. Perform the move 10 times on each side.Crunches are also a great way to strengthen your core. Lie on your back and either place your feet flat on the floor, with your legs bent at the knee, or with your feet flat on a wall in front of you so that your legs make a 90 degree angle with the floor. Cross your arms across your chest and slowly raise your head and shoulders off the floor. Hold this position for a few seconds before lowering yourself back to the ground. Repeat this move 10 times."

Change your incline.,
Alter your speed.,
Switch up your sets.",How to Diversify Your Workout2," If you do a lot of cardio, chances are you're on the same incline. Changing that incline can not only make your workout more challenging, but change up your workout enough to avoid plateauing in your results.For example, if you walk or run on your treadmill, you probably use the same incline every day. Instead, on days when you're feeling energetic, increase the incline on your treadmill for all or part of your run.
You can also make this adjustment if you run outside rather than on a treadmill by varying your route. Choose one with more hills or inclines to vary your runs on days when you have lots of energy.

, As with incline, working out at the same speed every day can be boring and interfere with your health and wellness goals. For example, you could vary the speed of your runs by increasing the speed for a portion of your run. You can also run more quickly for a set period of time, then slow back down.

, Routine is great for working out, because it makes it a regular part of your day. However, using the same machines or moves every single day can get boring. Switching up your sets can bring diversity to your workout.For example, if you swim a lot, you can easily vary the speed and intensity of your swim workout by using different sets. Some days you can focus more on pull sets - where you use your arms to propel yourself through the water. Other days focus on working on your kicking. Finally, you can have some workouts where you work on both pulling and kicking.

Try yoga or pilates.,
Switch up your cardio routines.,
Use a cross-trainer at your gym.,
Try circuit training.",How to Diversify Your Workout3," Yoga or pilates classes are great if you want to work a lot of muscle groups at once. You can sign up for yoga or pilates classes at your gym. If you don't have a gym membership, you can also look up yoga and pilates routines on YouTube - Yoga with Adriene and Yoga House are two great examples., If you are a runner, it can be tempting to only run or walk for your cardio. Switching up what sorts of cardio you do can help diversify your workout.For example, instead of only running, trying swimming or kickboxing or cycling. They are all cardio workouts and have the added benefit of helping you add muscle as well.

, Some gyms have exercise machines that are specifically designed to cross-train. They work out lots of different muscle groups at once, and often combine walking, stairs, and running. If you belong to a gym, ask a gym employee if there are cross-trainers in the gym, and if they could show you how to use them., Circuit training requires that you perform one movement on one machine as hard you can in a certain amount of time. Then you get a short break before you move to the next movement. Because circuit training utilizes a lot of different movements and equipment, it's an ideal way to diversify your workout through cross-training."

Go dancing.,
Chase your kids around the house or yard.,
Try a barre class.,

Ride your bike.",How to Diversify Your Workout4," Dancing can burn as many calories as regular sports, and has the added benefit of being able to be combined with social events or date night. Some clubs offer organized dance lessons before they open for the night, or you can look for dance classes offered by your gym or community through adult education programs.If you cannot take a regular dance class, try incorporating dance into your evening routine by playing the radio instead of the television a few nights each week or by taking free lessons from YouTube videos.

, If you have kids – or nieces or nephews – you can get a good workout by spending time with them! Running, ducking, and lifting are frequently incorporated with common family games such as hide-and-seek and tag., Barre classes are designed to give you a workout by learning and practicing ballet dancing. They’re great for any fitness level and are a great alternative to going to the gym., Systems Wii Fit or fitness/sports games for other platforms are a great way to mix up your workout. It will feel like playing a video game, but will work almost all of the same muscle groups and get your heart rate up the way a gym workout would., You can ride it through your neighborhood, or try a new trail you’ve never ridden before. Riding your bike is a great workout for your legs – and a great alternative to using weight machine at the gym."

Look into virtual or online personal trainers.,
Interview multiple trainers.,
Review and discuss your fitness goals.,
Talk about their schedule and current openings.,
Be wary of trainers that push special diets, supplements or medical advice.",How to Determine if You Need a Personal Trainer," One of the best reasons to hire a personal trainer is if you need help meeting a very specific fitness goal. They'll be able to guide and train you so you'll be successful.Before meeting with possible trainers, make sure that your goal is well thought out and clear. This will help possible trainers know whether or not they'll be able to help you.
For example, ""I want to improve my current running pace from a 10 minute mile to a 9 minute mile so I can finish a 5K quicker.""
Many trainers are certified in specialty areas - similar to doctors. You may need to hire a personal trainer who is also a running coach. Or you may need to find a personal trainer familiar with fitness or weight lifting competitions.
Having a trainer work with you on these specific goals is an invaluable experience. This could mean the difference between meeting your goal and missing it.;
, Another popular reason that many people end up hiring a personal trainer is that they want to improve their general fitness levels.Even if you don't have a very specific goal, a personal trainer could still be useful. Many people don't have a specific end goal, but just want to get in better shape.
You may feel like you're stuck at a plateau - doing the same weekly routine but without any improvements or progress. Or you may not exercise regularly but are looking to be able to get more consistent with a higher intensity activity.
For example, if you are not sure how to improve your baseline fitness levels, a personal trainer would be a great option.
A trainer could show you how to improve speed, strength and endurance with a variety of training exercises.

, If you're interested in becoming stronger, building more muscle mass or seeing more definition, consider hiring a personal trainer.


Anyone can hop on a treadmill or elliptical and torch calories doing cardiovascular exercise. Most of the time, it's fairly self explanatory. However, if you're interested in perfecting strength training, it can be a little more complicated.
Many times, just lifting weights or using weight machines isn't enough. It's about the type of exercise, the amount of weight you use, the total reps you can perform and how many sets you do. This can make it complicated to meet your goal.
A personal trainer will be able to help explain to you and show you how to incorporate specific strength training exercises to help meet a goal of increased mass or definition.
In addition, they can change or adapt your plan as you slowly come closer to your goal and progress overtime.

, Another very common reason people hire personal trainers is to help them lose weight. If this is part of your goal, consider hiring a trainer to help you.Exercise is an important part of any weight loss routine. It can help burn calories and increase muscle mass which helps improve your metabolism over time.Although exercise alone generally doesn't result in a lot of weight loss, using a personal trainer in conjunction with a lowered calorie diet can result in great weight loss.
If you feel you need a little extra help losing weight, talk to a personal trainer. Discuss your weight loss goals with them, what type of diet you plan to follow and how you think exercise will help you meet your goals.
A trainer is also great for weight loss, as they can hold you accountable. But, depending on your needs and on your specific trainer, you might choose to have weight loss as a fitness goal, or you might choose not to be weighed. Being weighed can be intimidating, and you also might not want to lose weight as a result of personal training. Either way, you can choose with your personal trainer how much and how often you will be weighed, if at all.

, Another great reason to consider hiring a personal trainer is if you're getting a little bored with your current exercise routine. A trainer can help spice up your workouts.It's easy to get into the habit of doing the same thing over and over again each week. Whether it's a morning run a few days a week or going to the same spin class each week, your workouts could get a little boring.
If you feel yourself getting burnout and bored with your workout, consider booking a few sessions with a personal trainer. They may be able to give you a unique workout that could motivate you to stay consistent with exercise.
Talk to a trainer about your typical workouts and why they just aren't cutting it anymore. You want them to be able to fully understand what does and doesn't work for you.
Ask them to help design you a new program that's more exciting and motivating. They may show you new cardio moves or even teach you how to use different types of gym equipment.

, If there's one thing to consider before choosing a personal trainer, it's figuring out your budget. Personal training can be costly, so be prepared to budget for this expense.


Personal training can range widely on cost. It'll depend on whether or not you do one-on-one sessions, group sessions or are doing it through your gym or at home.
If you can, start by doing an introductory or promotional package. This could be through your gym or a special you find online. This will allow you to save some money and see whether or not you enjoy the sessions.
Also, decide whether or not you want to see your trainer multiple times a week, once a week or just twice a month. Fewer sessions will be less expensive in the long run.
Also look for package discounts. Sometimes you can purchase 3 sessions or 10 sessions for a package price which would be cheaper than 3 or 10 individual sessions.
If you do enjoy personal training and would like to continue, make sure to budget for that expense weekly or monthly.

, One particular reason that many people want to hire a personal trainer is because they need a little extra push when it comes to exercise.If you feel like you stop exercising when you get tired and don't have the self discipline to push yourself further, consider hiring a personal trainer.


A personal trainer can be useful not only in teaching you different or new exercise routines, but they also can provide an extra push of encouragement when you need it. If a trainer is instructing you and watching you, you may be more likely to do a few extra sets or push through a few extra seconds of cardio.
A personal trainer is also great for accountability. If you find yourself sleeping through your morning workouts more often than not, a personal trainer can help.
Not only do you have to pay for your training sessions (which makes it much more likely you'll show up), thinking of letting someone else down, may help you stick to your training schedule more often.

, Another great reason you may want to hire a personal trainer is because you have a special competition, event or race coming up.A personal trainer, especially if they train in specific areas of fitness, can really make the difference between failure and success in an event.
If you know you have a half marathon coming or a weight lifting competition coming up in the next few months, a personal trainer can make sure that you're trained appropriately and are truly ready for your event.
In addition, a trainer can help your body get to where it needs to be for your event without a possible injury.

, One of the most common reasons that people hire a personal trainer is that they haven't had a great exercise history.


If you've had a lot of injuries in the past from exercise, haven't been able to meet exercise goals or consistently hit an exercise plateau, consider hiring a personal trainer.
You can avoid a lot of heartache and injury by using a personal trainer. They can give you the right plan to meet your specific goals. There won't be anymore plateaus or injuries.
In addition, if you do injure yourself or are hitting a stall, the trainer will be able to modify your workout on the spot to account for these changes.

, One of the best ways to find a trustworthy and reliable trainer is through family and friends. Nothing is better than getting a positive recommendation from someone you know.


Give your friends and family a call and see if any of them are using a personal trainer or have used one in the past.
If they're local, ask whether or not they enjoyed that particular trainer and why. Was the price decent? Was the trainer fun to work with? What was their personality like?
If any of your friends or family members are currently using a personal trainer, ask if they'd be willing to split a session with you. This allows you and your friend to split the cost in half and workout together.

, One of the first places to look is at your local gym. Even if you don't belong to a gym, look for personal training options that are offered at nearby fitness centers.


Most gyms will have personal trainers on staff for their clients. Many times, the trainers are there to help clients learn to use machines or to answer quick questions.Some gyms, especially when you start a new membership, will offer you a discounted training package or a session free. Talk to your gym manager to see if there are any special offers like these.

, If using a personal trainer at a gym is just not the right option for you, consider seeing if you can find a trainer that does in home services.


If you have a well stocked home gym, you might want to consider searching for a trainer that would be willing to come to your house. Although this can be more expensive, it's very convenient.If this is the option you go for, make sure you inform the trainer of exactly what equipment you have. They may opt to bring additional equipment with them to help you get the best workout.
You can search online for trainers that offer in-home personal training either at your own home or their home. Many trainers will offer one or the other and sometimes both options.

, Another, yet not as common option, is looking for a virtual or online trainer. This can be helpful if you'd like to have some specific guidance but can't find a local trainer near you.Start by doing a quick search online for online personal training services. You may see services that are done via email or even done through a live video feed. Choose which option you feel most comfortable with.
You can find trainers that do a workout with you and you watch them and mimic their moves. Or you can find a trainer who instructs you and watches you through a live video feed.
Although not as convenient, online options may be a little less expensive than in-person training.

, Regardless of where you find your personal trainer, it's important to interview them first. You may even want to consider interviewing multiple trainers to make sure you find just the right one for you.Try interviewing a few trainers at your gym, or gym trainers and a home trainer, to see which person is best for your needs.
You may also consider asking them if you can watch them working with other clients. You'll be able to see their personality, style of training and how they motivate their clients.
Ask the trainer about their personal style of training. Are they more of a ""drill sergeant"" type? Or do they gently encourage you?
Review your trainer's credentials and certifications as part of your interview process. Ask to see their license and any other credentials or certifications they have.

, Always start by reviewing your personal fitness goals with your trainer. This will help both you and the trainer decide if you'd make a good match.It's a good idea to review your goals with a prospective trainer before you officially hire them or purchase sessions with them. If you don't, you might end up mismatched with someone who is not the best choice.
Be specific with your goals. The more specific you are about where you are now and where you want to be long term, the more helpful your personal trainer will be.
Also, ask your trainer how they will help you meet your goals. Ask them for some details on a prospective plan for you.

, One important component to review with a potential personal trainer is their schedule and current openings. You need to make sure that you'll be able to fit in your training.


Most trainers will have a variety of openings for clients. They will generally see people early in the morning or in the evening hours after work.
Consider what time of day works best for you. You need to have probably at least an hour of time for a session and make sure that it's a time that you'll want to be exercising.
Talk to the trainer about their openings and availability in addition to your own personal schedule. Then decide whether or not you'll be able to work together.

, Although most of the personal trainers you'll meet and interview will be well qualified and personable, there are some trainers that should raise a red flag.


If you are meeting with a trainer that's suggesting you start taking a variety of vitamin, mineral or herbal supplements, this is a red flag. Supplements should not be involved with personal training and only be suggested by a physician.Also, if your trainer starts giving you medical advice, be mindful that this is coming from a fitness professional, not a doctor. This is another reason for a red flag.
Personal trainers are fitness experts, but their scope of practice does not include nutrition, supplementation or medical advice. It's not recommended to take advice from trainers in these areas. Follow up with a dietitian or your doctor if needed.

Determine your fitness goals.",How to Design a Fitness Training Plan1," Before beginning any fitness training program, it is important to get examined by a health professional. A doctor or nurse can identify health conditions, joint weaknesses, or contraindications for certain types of exercise and may even be able to recommend specific types of exercise programs that are safe for whatever conditions you may have.;
, Be realistic about the amount of time you can commit to your fitness regimen. Most adults should aim for about 150 minutes total of physical activity per week, ideally in at least 3 separate sessions. This will vary depending on your fitness goals and current level of physical fitness.


Plan the number and duration of fitness training sessions you can reasonably expect to complete in any given week. Consider 5 sessions of 30 minutes with 2 days of rest each week or 3 sessions of 50 minutes each week.
Plan the time of day you will work out. Some individuals prefer morning workouts while others prefer evening or weekend sessions. The time of day you will be exercising may dictate where or how you will exercise (indoors versus outdoors, at home versus at the gym, etc.).

, To build an effective fitness training program, it is essential that you enjoy or have a high level of commitment to the activities you will include in your plan.


Consider a variety of both cardio and strength training activities, as both will be essential to an effective fitness training program.

, Having specific goals will also dictate what types of exercise you should build into your plan, the amount of time you will need to exercise, and whether your fitness plan will need to include significant dietary changes.


If your goals include weight loss, you will need to consider dietary changes as well as significant cardio activity. Strength training is also essential to boosting metabolism rates and burning more calories.
If your fitness goals are targeted at a contest or event, such as a triathlon or marathon, your program will include interval training, targeted activities, and a significant time commitment.

If you will be exercising at home, consider dance workout videos, a stationary bike or treadmill, running the steps, cardio Pilates routines, or a combination of jumping jacks and jump rope.
If you have access to a full gym, consider swimming laps, using an elliptical machine, playing racquetball or basketball, taking an aerobics class, or trying your hand at cardio kickboxing.
If you will be exercising outdoors, take advantage of cardio activities such as ultimate Frisbee games, distance biking, racing your children, playing volleyball or soccer, or jogging with your dog.

, Strength training should be part of every fitness plan. Having a list of go-to options for building or toning muscle can make it easy to bring variety to your routine and workout multiple muscle groups each week.


Consider strength training that uses equipment. Weight machines, dumbbells, exercise balls, and resistance bands are convenient tools for a wide variety of strength-building routines.
If you will be working out at home, consider investing in resistance bands or other low-cost strength training equipment to make weight routines affordable and convenient.
Make a list of strength routines that do not require equipment. Body resistance can be very effective for building muscle through everything from push-ups to yoga poses. Water bottles or canned goods can be used in place of light dumbbells, and many exercise videos focus entirely on body resistance strength training.

, Depending on your fitness goals, your routine may be cardio heavy, strength training heavy, or an even combination of the two.


If your goal is weight loss, devote the majority of your time to cardio routines. Include strength training about twice each week and be sure that your routine will tone muscles in the upper body and core as well as the lower body for the maximum benefit.
If your goal is to tone or build muscle, devote most of your workouts primarily to strength routines. Do not work out the same muscle group 2 days in a row; alternate to allow your muscles time to heal. Consider 5 or 6 days each week of shorter routines, working arms and abs on days 1 and 3, legs and back on days 2 and 4, and performing cardio and your target muscle group exercises again on days 5 and 6.
If you are training to complete a physical challenge, consider following a pre-made training plan for a triathlon, marathon, Iron Man, or other program. This will help you scale up your activities appropriately based on the type and amount of exercise you will need to do and the amount of time you have to prepare.

Design a weekly exercise chart.,
Keep a list of substitute options.,
Keep a record of your progress.",How to Design a Fitness Training Plan3," Once you have developed the length of time and type of activities you will complete each day, record it on a piece of paper divided into the days of the week. Be sure to include the expected time and place of your workout in the written plan.

, When you get bored of a particular routine or when results slow (typically within 2 to 3 weeks), replace a cardio or strength routine with an option from your list of substitutes. This will allow you to use your muscles differently and can jumpstart your metabolism if your body has grown accustomed to your prior routine.


A list of substitute activities will also be useful for working out while traveling, trying to include friends in occasional workouts, or for inclement weather.

, Keeping a fitness journal will allow you to identify trends in your workout habits or fitness accomplishments.


Track whether you completed entire or only partial planned workouts and examine how your endurance or ability to complete the activity effectively improves over time.
Track running times or distances for each workout, weight loss once per week, and waist or muscle diameter once per month to get an idea of your progress.

Stand with your back flush against a wall.,
Get into correct head posture by touching the back of your head to the wall.,
Stand this way for 1 minute.",How to Correct Forward Head Posture1," Align your heels at shoulder width apart, press your buttocks against the wall, and be sure your shoulder blades are touching the wall (this is more important than the tops of your shoulders touching the wall).You may need to squeeze your shoulder blades together slightly to get them in a more natural position and align with the wall. This is sometimes called ""opening your chest.""
As you get into position, pay attention to your head position. Notice whether or not the back of your head touches the wall. If it does not touch the wall, you have forward head posture, and it is likely that you suffer from weak neck muscles.;
, Pretend that there is a string going from the base of your neck to the top of your head. Pull that string up from the top creating a longer neck. As the back of your neck gets longer, you chin should tuck in and down somewhat toward the back of your neck. This is correct neck and head posture.


Make sure you are not simply moving your head backwards and increasing the curve of the neck. This is also improper posture. Focus on creating length in the back of the neck.

, This is your correct head posture, and you want your body to remember it. Return to this position frequently to review how your posture is changing.

Jog for 30 seconds.,
Repeat this entire circuit/interval training exercise 4 to 8 times.",How to Do a Beach Workout1," Go down towards the water where the sand is packed. Warm up by doing a 10 minute jog or walk down the beach.;
, Start in a standing position with your feet together. Then, step your right foot in front and lower your body so that your knee is almost to the ground.


Rise up to your starting position and bring your left leg to meet your right leg. Step forward with your left leg. Keep your hands on your hips during this exercise and make sure your front knee never passes your toes.







, Keep a steady pace that allows you to recover your breath, but also keep your heart rate high. This is your ""resting"" period, so do a fast walk, if you are unable to jog.

, Find 2 markers on the beach, such as lifeguard stands. Sprint to 1 stand, touch the ground and sprint back.

, Stop and do 10 squats in place. With feet hip width apart, lower your butt till your thighs are almost parallel to the ground, and then slowly raise your body up.

, Stop and do 10 jumping jacks. Walk in place for 10 seconds, and then do 10 more jumping jacks.

, Stop and do 10 squat thrusts. Crouch down, place your hands in front of your knees, and then kick your legs back into a plank position.


Jump back to your original crouching position and stand up. Repeat this motion 10 times.







, The circuits should take about 5 minutes to complete. With a 10 minute warm up, the total cardio interval training with 4 rounds would take 30 minutes.

Wear pants that fit well.,
Use a fabric measuring tape.,
Find your measurement.,
Consult a universal size chart.",How to Determine Belt Size1," Put on a pair of jeans or pants that you will wear frequently with a belt. These pants should not be too loose or too tight so that you will be able to get an accurate measurement of your waist.The most important thing is to choose a pair of pants that fit how your pants usually fit. You want to get a belt that will fit with the pants you normally wear.;
, While you are wearing the pants, thread a fabric measuring tape through the belt loops of the pants. Pinch the two sides together where they meet in front. This number will be your normal waist measurement.Breathe in deeply and out fully. The measuring tape should expand slightly. Let yourself account for a little extra wiggle room when you exhale so your belt doesn’t get too tight when you breathe.
Check to make sure that the measuring tape is in the middle or bottom of the belt holes, instead of flush with the top.

, Read the measurement in the mirror or mark the point where the two sides of the measuring tape meet with a safety pin. Remove the tape from the loops and read the measurement. Add two inches to the measurement. This is your belt size.For example, if the measuring tape reads 38 inches (96.5 cm), you want to purchase a 40-inch belt.
You need to add two inches because the measurement of your waist only accounts for the direct circumference of your waist. But the length of a belt does more than that – it includes additional length that must overlap to a certain extent at the buckle. The two added inches give you the wiggle room you need for a well-fitting belt.

, Since many belts are sold by size (small, medium, large, etc.) rather than measurement, it may be necessary for you to view a sizing chart that can help you determine the correct size. Men and women’s belts are typically sized differently since women are often more petite in size than men.Men’s small belts usually corresponds to a 30 inch (76.2 cm) waist, while a women’s small usually fits a 28 inch waist.
Men’s large belts usually fit a 36 inch (91.4 cm) waist, while a women’s large typically corresponds to a 32 inch waist.

Relieve your occipital muscles with a massage ball.,
Regularly stretch the back of your neck.,
Stretch the sides of your neck.,
Release the SCM muscle at the front of your neck.,
Stretch your chest muscles.,
Speak to a professional body-worker for advice.",How to Correct Forward Head Posture2," The small muscles at the base of your skull right above where your neck meets your head are your occipital muscles. Tightness here is responsible for a lot of pain and tension, and sometimes headaches and dizziness. The best way to relieve these muscles is with a ball massage. Use a tennis ball, racquetball, small foam roller, or anything with a similar shape. Lie flat on your back face up and place the ball under your neck right at the base of your skull on either side of your spine.Turn your head side to side to roll over different areas. Do this for about 5 minutes, and be sure to massage both sides.

, Stand up straight. Tilt your chin to your chest. Interlace your fingers and place them behind your head.Do NOT pull downward on your head, but allow the weight of your arms to apply gentle downward pressure on your head and stretch the back of your neck.


Hold for 30 seconds. Repeat 3 times or more.

, Stand or sit up straight. Keeping your nose facing straight ahead, bring your right ear to your right shoulder. Rest your right hand on the side of your head and allow the weight of your arm to gently pull, stretching the left side of your neck. Again, do not actively pull on your head – just let the weight of your arm apply gentle traction.


If your shoulders slump forward, bend your left elbow and place your left arm behind your back with your palm facing outward (when your head is tilting to the right).
Do this for 30 seconds on each side, repeating 3 times.

, Your sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle is that strong, thin muscle that stretches from right behind your ear down to about the middle of your throat (it connects to the end of your collarbone close to your midline), creating the little V-shaped divot at the front of your throat. You should be able to feel this strong band of muscle. Find it and gently massage it by pinching and rolling it lightly between your fingers.Go up and down the length of the muscle.


Don’t push too deep into your neck where you might hit other tender places. The massaging motion is like gently pulling or lifting the SCM away from other structures in your neck.
It might help you find and relax the muscle by turning your head in the opposite direction, i.e. turn your head to the left with your nose staying straight ahead to feel your right SCM.

, Walk into an open doorway. Place your right arm against the right side of the door with your palm facing the door. Bend your elbow so that it is in a 90° angle, with your forearm flush with the side of the door. Take a small step forward with your right foot. Keep your forearm touching the door. You should feel a stretch in your pectoral muscles at the front of your chest near your armpit.Hold the stretch for 30 seconds and repeat on the opposite side.

, Chiropractors and massage therapists are experts at understanding how posture problems cause pain, and how to fix them. See a massage therapist or have a chiropractic session and ask about stretches and exercises you can do at home.

Do chin retractions, otherwise known as nose nods.,
Practice shoulder blade squeezes.,
Improve your range of motion with advanced chin retractions.",How to Correct Forward Head Posture3," Lie on your back face up, bend your knees, and put your feet flat on the floor so that you do not strain your lower back. Keep your nose perpendicular (pointing straight up) to the ceiling. Nod your head slowly forward without moving your neck. Envision that you are drawing a small arc with the tip of your nose. Keep the movement very slow.Slowly return your nose to its vertical position. Repeat 10 times. In a few days, increase your repetitions to 20 times. The next week, begin doing 2 to 3 sets of nose nods per day. Once you get used to the motion, you can do them standing up against a wall or standing up away from the wall.

, Sit up straight in a chair. Your neck should be long and your knees bent at a 90° angle with your feet on the floor. Squeeze your shoulder blades together, as though you are trying to get them to touch. Hold this for 3 seconds, like you’re trying to hold a tennis ball between your shoulder blades. Slowly release your hold back to a relaxed position.


Intentionally drop your shoulders if tension has caused them to creep closer to your ears. Let your arms hang to your sides.
Repeat this exercise 10 times, moving in a controlled manner. Increase to holding for 10 seconds and then to doing 2 to 3 sets per day as you get stronger.
Chest tightness and weak back muscles are very common in people who spend a lot of time at a desk or in front of a computer. It tends to cause your shoulder to slump forward. This exercise helps to undo that poor posture.

, Sit in a chair or stand up straight. Practice your chin retractions/nose nods a few times. Do a chin retraction, letting your nose sweep downward slightly. Once it is retracted, keep your chin at the same distance to your neck, but move the top of your head backward.


Stay there for a few seconds and move slowly, returning your head to an upright position. Then, move out of the chin retraction. Do this 10 times, working up to increased repetitions and sets.
During this exercise, remember that you are not trying to increase the arc of your neck. You are trying to pivot your head backward in a natural and correct manner. People who have had forward head posture for an extended period of time may find this very difficult to do in the beginning.

Set up your computer ergonomically.,
Avoid carrying heavy bags or purses.,
Stretch every 30 minutes that you’re in front of a desk, computer, or TV.,
Buy a supportive neck pillow.,
Stand with good posture.,
Walk with good form.,
Try a posture brace.",How to Correct Forward Head Posture4," Raise your monitor so that the top third of your screen is at eye-level. Measure the distance from your monitor to your eyes to ensure it is 18 to 24 inches (45.7 to 61.0 cm) away from your face. You may need to prop your computer up on some books, use a taller or shorter desk, or adjust the height of your chair. Use a tape measure to determine how far your face is from your computer screen, and adjust where you place your chair accordingly. , Try to keep your shoulder bag or purse to a small size and minimal weight. If you do have a lot to carry, use a backpack rather than something with only one strap, and get a backpack that’s designed for even weight distribution.Avoid carrying bags on the same shoulder all the time, because this will lead to improper alignment. Switch shoulders regularly.

, If you work at a desk or work in front of a computer, get up and move around frequently to decrease the pressure on your neck and back. A brief pause to walk around every half hour can be beneficial. Try to take 30 seconds or a minute to do neck stretches every 2 hours. The same goes for sitting on the couch and watching television., If you often wake up with a sore neck, you probably have poor sleep posture. Supportive neck pillows allow your head to fall into the middle of the pillow, supporting your neck with a firm, curved section at the bottom of the pillow.

, While walking, keep your shoulders back and aligned. Squeeze your core muscles (your abdominal muscles) to keep your body straighter. Bend your knees a little bit to take some pressure off of your hips. Invest in shoes with good arch support – it’s amazing how much this can help your posture., Keep your chin parallel to the floor when you’re walking, and walk with a heel-to-toe motion. Don’t stare at your feet or arch your back; keep your butt and belly lined up with the rest of your body., Using a posture brace has been shown to help improve posture by forcing your shoulders back and keep your head aligned with your vertebrae. Using a posture brace daily can not only help maintain a proper posture but in fact improve your shoulder positioning.

Use the water as both resistance training, and a way to cool off during a hot workout.,
Go into the water and turn so that you can run parallel to the waves.,
Do shuttle sprints into the water, if you have not already completed shuttle sprints during your cardio workout.",How to Do a Beach Workout2," Take off your shoes and place them by a towel. Drink plenty of water, if you have just completed the cardio workout.


Make sure you can swim and get a friend to workout with you if you want to workout in the water. Always check the beach conditions, so that you can try to avoid riptides and other dangers.

, Stop when the water is just less than knee deep. Run for 5 minutes with the added resistance of the water.


If you want to walk instead, go into the water until it is just over knee height. Walk through the water for 5 minutes. The added resistance of the water will make it harder to move your legs. Keep your core stable and your hands at your hips.







, Start at your towel, sprint into the water, dip your body below the surface, and sprint back.


Do this whenever you want to cool down during the latter half of your workout.

"
"
Return to your towel and lay on your back.,
Do abdominal crunches for 60 seconds.,
Turn over and get into plank position.,
Turn onto your back.,
Turn onto your stomach and do push ups.,
Stretch your body thoroughly.",How to Do a Beach Workout3," Make sure it is away from the water, on soft, unstable sand. Bend your knees and place them hip-width apart.

, You can do half-crunches or crunches depending upon the strength of your abdominal muscles.

, Make sure you are supported by your forearms (or arms) and your feet, with toes curled under. Keep your back straight and hold the position for 60 seconds.

, Place your hands at your sides, and draw your knees into table-top position. Your back should be straight on the ground, with your knees together and lower abdominal muscles pulled in tight.


Hold this position for 60 seconds. To increase the difficulty of the position, straighten your legs and hold them at a 45 degree angle from the ground.

, Do 1 set of 10 push ups. Rest for 30 seconds, and do another set of 10 push ups.

, Make sure to get your hamstrings, calves, quads, back and arms. Stretching will burn calories, ease tension from the muscles and help to avoid soreness the next day.

Find a belt that fits.,
Spread the belt out flat.,
Measure the belt.,
Use the measurement that you found to order a belt.,
Use an existing pair of pants.",How to Determine Belt Size2," Take a belt that fits well – either one that you already have or go to a clothing store and try on belts until you find one that fits the way you want it to. You want the belt to have several notches on each side of the notch you use. A belt that fits well won’t use the last notch or the first notch when it closes.Be sure to wear pants that fit you well so that you can get an accurate idea about what size belt you need if you’re trying on a variety of belts.

, Put the belt on a flat surface like a table or on the floor. Lay it down so that the belt is completely flat and doesn’t have any bumps sticking out. Make sure the belt is fully extended and doesn’t have any slack.If the belt doesn’t want to stay flat (because of overuse, for example), you can place a heavy object on both ends of the belt to keep it stationary.

, Grab a retractable measuring tape or a fabric measuring tape. Measure from the base of the buckle prong to the center hole. If you don’t use the center hole, measure from the base of the buckle prong to the hole you use the most.This number will probably range between 30 inches (76.2 cm) and 60 inches (152.4 cm), depending on your waist size.

, The number (in inches) that you found for the measurement of the belt will be the size you use for ordering your new belt. For example, if the measurement number is 34 inches (86.4 cm), order a size 34 belt.If you are using the last hole on a belt, consider moving up a belt size (in this example, to a 36) so that there is room to adjust the belt in the future. A correctly fitted belt is usually sized to the center hole.
If you are using the first hole on the belt, consider moving down a belt size to a 32.

, Alternatively, you can use a pair of jeans that fits you (one that is measured numerically by waist size in inches) and use that measurement to determine your belt size. Simply add two inches to the size of the pants and use that as your belt size.Remember that the pants must already be sized in inches, otherwise this method won’t be effective.

Enlist the help of a tailor.,
Wear appropriate pants.,
Get measured.",How to Determine Belt Size3," If you want to make sure you find out what your true belt size is with no mistakes, find a professional tailor (or clothing store employee) to help you determine your measurements. A trained tailor will be able to help you get an accurate measurement for your belt size with no margin for error.Ask people you know for recommendations for a good tailor. Search the internet for tailors in your area.
If that doesn’t work, try going to a clothing store and ask an employee to help you.

, Make sure you wear pants that fit snugly when you go to get measured. You don’t want any loose material adding inches to your measurement, as this will cause your belt to be too loose as well.You also don’t want to wear pants that fit too tightly because this can also make you end up with a belt that doesn’t fit properly.

, Let the professional tailor measure your waist with a fabric tape measure. They will tell you how to stand and help you find the right measurement for your belt.


Be sure to stand normally and breathe normally so that the tailor can get an accurate measurement.
Use the measurement number the tailor gives you to order a new belt that fits properly.

Schedule in your weekly workouts.,
Plan enough time for your workout.,
Minimize distractions at home.,
Choose a distraction-free time at the gym.,
Reconsider reading material.,
Choose the right type of music.,
Leave your phone in your gym bag.,
Choose the best time for your workouts.,
Limit the time you set aside to workout.,
Include a variety of exercises in your routine.,
Sign up for a race or competition.",How to Create Distraction Free Workouts," One of the biggest distractions to exercise is your life. Work, kids, family, and school can get in the way of your workouts quickly. Overcome this common source of distractions by scheduling in your exercise.


Start with a weekly or monthly calendar. Write in all of your activities and obligations that you know. You'll need to plan your exercise around these items.
Next, start to schedule in your exercise sessions. You don't necessarily need to exercise everyday, but choose a few days out of the week where you can fit in a workout.
You may even want to consider adding one or two times of ""make-up"" exercise if you know you have a particularly busy or stressful week. This back up plan can help ensure you get in enough activity overall.;
, Nothing is worse or more distracting that having to squeeze in a workout when you truly don't have enough time. Plan for adequate amounts of time so you can relax and get in a full exercise routine.


If you're worried about being late for work or picking up you kids from school, you might not work as hard or quit exercising earlier than you need to.
Take the amount of time you need for your fitness routine into account. Trying to squeeze an hour workout in forty-five minutes before you head out to work may not be feasible.
Look at your weekly or monthly workout schedule and ensure that you're giving yourself enough time to get to your gym if needed, exercise and get home. Don't push yourself to fit too much in.

, If you're choosing to stay home and workout, try to minimize the typical distractions that may get in your way.


Although working out at home is definitely cheaper and sometimes more convenient than going to the gym, it may come with more distractions. If you find yourself rarely finishing a workout, stopping multiple times during a workout or skipping it all together, exercising at home may not be the way to go.
For example, if working out in your dark basement or trying to fit in some activity in between your kids homework and bedtime is preventing you from being consistent, try going outside or to a gym to help give you the time and inspirational space to exercise.
Alternatively, you can ask a friend or your spouse to watch your children or hire a babysitter for the thirty minutes to an hour that you plan to exercise. If you have a friend who lives nearby, you may be able to trade off watching the kids and working out for thirty minutes each.
Try to double-task your workout. If you want to spend time with a friend or your family, plan an activity that allows you to get some exercise while enjoying time with them. For example, you could go on a long walk together, you could try rock climbing, or you could take the kids to the zoo.
Consider breaking up your workout time into smaller segments, such as three ten-minute periods. That will allow you to get in your workout time without carving out a large block of distraction-free time.

, Many people have the luxury of going to a gym or fitness center for their exercise routine. Gyms offer the benefit of having a variety of equipment, aerobics classes and trained staff to help you get and stay fit. However, these same reasons can also be frustrating or distracting to you. Don’t feel like you have to ostracize yourself to get in your workout. It’s possible to take part in gym culture while still getting in your workout efficiently.


If you find yourself losing time to chats with fellow gym-goers, try wearing visible ear-buds, even if you aren’t listening to music. When you see people you know, it will be easy to wave, smile, and nod without having to stop and talk. Because you’re wearing the ear-buds, people are more likely to accept a quick greeting and move on.
Create a workout checklist for yourself, and check off each task as you complete it. If you act focused, then you will be focused. It will also show those around you that it’s not a good time for you to talk because you are goal-focused.
If you are able to, try going to the gym at off-peak times when there aren’t as many people there. Ask a gym employee when the quiet times are so that you can try to find one that works with your schedule.
Bad weather days are often popular days at the gym, so they are a good day to do your workout at home.
If you notice you can't get in a good workout, choose a time and space at home to exercise, or consider using the great outdoors for a natural location.
You may want to consider doing a combination of both at-home exercises and going to the gym. For example, you can run in your neighborhood and then go to the gym for weight training.

, Some people choose to read books, magazines or the newspaper during their workout. Although reading may help you take your mind off an activity you don’t enjoy, it can also distract you so much that you undermine your workout. It’s better to focus on your breathing, heart-rate, and the muscles you’re targeting.


It takes a lot of focus to read and concentrate on reading material while you're working out. If you need or want to be working out at a moderate to high intensity pace, reading may hinder you.Focus on your breath and heart-rate to make sure that you are working out in your target zone. To focus on your breath, breathe in for three steps and out for three steps. Monitor your heart-rate with a heart-rate monitor, or, at the very least, the monitor on the machine. You may need to up or lower the intensity of your workout to ensure that you’re reaching your goals and doing it safely.
Depending on your workout, you may try focusing on your target muscles. For example, as you workout on an elliptical, you may spend a few minutes focusing on working your glutes then a few minutes focusing on your calves, and so forth. By focusing on target muscles, you can make sure that you are following through on the movements needed to work them.
In you do choose to read, be careful where you place any reading material. Trainers typically do not recommend placing anything below eye level. You don't want to be looking down or hunching over to read. Place books, magazines or tablets at or above eye level and ensure you're not bending your neck downwards to read.
If you notice you're working out a lower intensity or pace, consider giving up your reading material so you can focus on your pace and intensity.

, Listening to music can be a great motivator for exercise. However, choose the right type of music to fuel your workout, not set you back.


Try to choose songs or music that has a beat or tempo similar to your exercise pace. You may even want to find something with a tempo just slightly faster than your pace to motivate you and keep you going.Avoid songs or types of music that are slow, keep your pace slower or encourage you to stop exercising.

, Another common distraction is your cell phone. This is especially true if you're constantly getting text messages or phone calls. Leave this behind to minimize these types of distractions.If you're constantly getting calls from friends, family members or your boss, switch off your phone, put it on silent or leave it in your gym bag. If you're tempted to answer these calls, you'll never be able to get a good workout in.
Also, attempting to text and run or text and use the elliptical machine may not be safe. You're not paying attention and may throw off your balance. Save texting for later.
If you use your phone for music, set it to a ""do not disturb"" setting so calls and texts do not show up or come through. But it might be best to leave it off!

, The timing of your workouts is key for long-term consistency. If you can't make your workouts or it's inconvenient you're more likely to stop going.Think about your typical day or week. When is the best time to fit in a workout? When will you be able to dedicate thirty minutes or an hour of time just for exercise? Make sure this time also doesn't come with distractions that can derail you.
You can also choose different times to workout on different days. This will be helpful if you have different work schedules or your children have different schedules on different days. This is why scheduling in your workouts is effective as well.
Many times working out in the morning is better-if you can get up. You're more likely to get it in and stay consistent. Plus, the ""rest of your day"" won't get in the way of an afternoon exercise session.

, While it’s tempting to plan a long workout, especially if you want to reach your goals faster, it’s also counterproductive. Oftentimes, setting aside too much time to workout reduces focus and invites more distraction. This happens because it’s harder to maintain focus for longer periods of time. Instead, it’s better to set aside thirty minutes to an hour for your workout.

Most people can get a great workout in thirty minutes to an hour, so don’t feel like you need to do more.

, Another reason people may stop working out or ditch the gym is boredom.Doing the same routine day after day, week after week, can get old.


Switch up your workouts regularly or include a variety of exercises each week. This can help things stay spiced up, fun and exciting.
If you find yourself dreading your daily workout, it's time for a change. Don't wait to decide to change up your routine after you've quit for a few weeks. The second you notice boredom or dislike, go for something new.
Try aerobic classes, outdoor exercising, working out with a friend or changing up the time of your workouts.

, One way to stay consistent, motivated and on track is by signing up for a race.


Consider signing up for a short or long race-wherever your fitness level is. Training for a race requires you to stick to a program for a set amount of time. This can keep you on track.
In addition, if you're a competitive person, the training may be motivating and exciting as you improve your athletic performance.

, After you wipe out as much moisture as you can from inside the gloves, sanitize and disinfect them with a half-and-half vinegar and water solution. Transfer the solution to a spray bottle and give the inside of the gloves several spritzes.









You can use white vinegar or apple cider vinegar to clean your gloves.For additional antibacterial and anti-fungal action, add five to 10 drops of tea tree oil to the vinegar and water solution.Avoid harsh cleaning sprays on your gloves, as they can damage the gloves and cause a reaction with your skin.Similarly, avoid products like Febreze, because they only mask smells and don’t actually kill bacteria. They can also make your gloves stiff and uncomfortable.

, Spray your vinegar and water solution onto the outside of the gloves, enough to coat each glove with a light mist. Then, wipe them down with a clean towel to remove dirt, sweat, and any extra cleaning solution.








, Many boxing gloves are made of leather, and this means they should be conditioned to keep them in tip-top shape. Leather is the skin from a living creature, and it can dry out just like human skin.There are many commercial leather conditioners available on the market, or you can use lemon essential oil instead.








To condition the gloves, apply a small amount of conditioner or a few drops of oil to the outside of the gloves. Using a lint-free cloth and circular motions, work the oil into the leather. When you're finished, wipe the outside of the gloves down with a clean towel to remove any excess.

, Because the bacteria in your gloves lives in the sweat and moisture that gets trapped inside, keeping your gloves dry also means keeping them clean. After you sanitize the inside of the gloves with vinegar and clean the outside, allow the gloves to dry out completely.


To air dry the gloves, fold the wrist straps back, open up the gloves as wide as possible, and attach the wrist straps so the gloves stay open.Lay the gloves out or hang them to dry like this in a well-ventilated room, near an open window, or in front of a fan.Even if you don’t sanitize and clean the gloves after every time you use them, you should always let them dry out between uses.

, Another way to dry out gloves faster is by stuffing them with newspaper, because the newspaper will absorb excess moisture inside and keep the gloves propped open to allow air in.








Crinkle up a few sheets of newspaper into two loose balls. Stuff one inside each glove and leave them for a couple hours. Check on the paper regularly, and when you notice that it has become saturated with moisture, replace it with fresh paper balls.

, If you have multiple fights or practices scheduled within a short time and need to dry your gloves out quickly, a blow dryer is a good way to do it. Make sure you use a blow dryer with a cool setting, as heat can damage the gloves and harden the leather.


Turn the blow dryer on to its cool setting and direct the nozzle inside the opening of a glove. Check on the moisture situation in five minute intervals, and when one glove is dry, repeat with the other.

, While the sun is a great way to dry out many things, boxing gloves aren't one of them. Some sunshine can dry out your gloves and kill bacteria, but too much sun can damage the gloves and the leather the same way it damages human skin.


If you want to use the sun to help dry your gloves, don’t leave them unattended in direct sunlight, and don’t leave them out for more than 20 to 30 minutes at a time.

, Baking soda is a universal deodorizer, and it can be used inside your boxing gloves to eliminate odors and neutralize bad smells. When your gloves are dry, sprinkle a few pinches of baking soda inside each glove and let it sit for a couple hours.To remove the baking soda, either bang out the gloves or stick a skinny vacuum cleaner nozzle in there.

, After cleaning and drying your gloves, take a dryer sheet and wipe down the inside of each glove with the sheet. If you want, you can even leave a half-sheet in each glove until the next time you need them.







, Take a pair of clean cotton socks and fill each one with a handful of cedar chips (like the kinds you use for either smoking food or for animal bedding). Loosely tie off the ends of the socks and stuff one sock in each glove.


Not only will the cedar chips make your gloves smell great, they’ll also absorb excess moisture and bacteria.

, Essential oils are a great way to make anything smell nice, and boxing gloves are no exception. Furthermore, certain essential oils are also antibacterial and anti-fungal, so they’ll also help clean your gloves. Add 10 drops of your preferred essential oil to a spray bottle with one cup (240 ml) of water and give one to two sprays in each glove. The best antibacterial and anti-fungal essential oils include:Lemongrass
Eucalyptus
Peppermint
Orange

Learn to squat.,
Perform a glute bridge chest press.,
Try a dumbbell tricep extension.Sit on a flat bench or box.,
Practice the dumbbell bent over row.",How to Choose the Right Dumbbell Weight," Are you trying to develop a single muscle group? Gain stamina? Perform a better curl? Setting your goals will guide your dumbbell selection process. Heavier dumbbells are good for building muscle, while lighter ones are better for stabilizing muscle to support tendons and joints.In general, the larger the muscle group, the more weight it can lift. Use small to medium dumbbells for your biceps, triceps and deltoids, and medium to large weights for working your chest, leg, and back muscles.


Write your goals down before and during your dumbbells training. This way, you can stay focused and modify or adjust your intentions if a goal has been met. For instance, you might write, “I want to be able to do a set of eight bicep curls with 35 pound dumbbells in the next two months.”;
, Depending on the exercise, you might want dumbbells of different weights. For instance, if you’re doing a basic curl, you might be able to curl 15 pounds. If you’re doing a squat with your dumbbells, however, you might choose a 20 or 25 pound dumbbell set. Likewise, if you are learning a new exercise, you will want to start light and focus on building proper form before adding weight.Don’t settle for just one set of dumbbells. Ensure you have a range of different weights to accommodate the various exercises you want to perform. Most beginners should have three sets of dumbbells, a light one, a medium one, and a heavy one, to accommodate different types of exercises.
Begin any new exercise with a lighter dumbbell set to learn proper form and technique. After two to four weeks of regularly practicing the moves, you may be ready to move on to a heavier dumbbell set for that exercise.

, Many gyms and workout programs have such professionals on hand in order to provide you with guidance and show you how to perform certain exercises properly. Don’t be shy -- just let the trainer know directly that you’re new to the world of dumbbells and are interested in their thoughts regarding which would be best for you.

, Practice working out with very light dumbbells until you've mastered proper form for each exercise you're doing. Start out slowly with an easily manageable dumbbell at first, then add weight in small one or two pound increments as you build strength.


For instance, you might start out with weights at five pounds, then find that they are not providing you with enough of a challenge. Add weight gradually, working up in small increments. If five pounds is not enough, try six or seven before jumping up to ten.
Keep a journal recording how many reps of each exercise you did, the weight you chose for that exercise, and your feelings about whether it was too light, too heavy, or just right.
Always choose the weight that’s right for you. Listen to your body to decide what’s right for you. Do not select a weight based on what others of your age or gender are lifting. The only person you should be trying to beat in a dumbbell-lifting competition is you., Once you have found the right dumbbell weight for an exercise, start to increase one or two pounds at a time to meet the needs of your growing muscles. If you aren’t feeling a moderate to intense muscle strain after performing 15 reps of a given exercise, it’s time to add some weight or procure heavier dumbbells, or otherwise change the exercise.Carefully monitor how many sets and reps you can do continuously and, if you find that you can do more than your target number of repetitions, increase the amount of weight you're lifting by one to two pounds.
Incorporating different exercises for the same muscles can change how the muscle is targeted. If you are not feeling strain with one exercise, try another to develop more complete strength.

, Normally, this shouldn’t be a problem, since as a smart and safe weightlifter you’ve started out at the low end of your dumbbell weight-lifting range and worked your way up. Never start out with a heavy weight and work your way down to the weight you need to be at.


When first starting with a particular weight, if you cannot do more than seven reps of a given exercise, it is too heavy for you.Set the weight which is too heavy aside and select a dumbbell one to three pounds lighter, depending upon what is available. Adjust in small increments to get the best possible weight for your exercise.
Picking a weight that is too heavy can cause you to develop bad form and, more seriously, injure yourself.

, A dumbbell squat involves holding the dumbbells in your hand at hip or shoulder level. Hold the dumbbell with your palms facing your shoulders or hips. Grip the dumbbells in both hands while leaning back on your heels and lowering yourself down as if you’re sitting. Bend at your knees until they come to a ninety degree angle, then return to a standing position. To keep the knees safe, keep them aligned vertically above the ankle. The knee should never extend past the toes.

, A chest press can help you build stronger chest muscles.Lie on your back with your feet placed firmly on the floor, knees, bent, and heels tucked in close to your rear end. Lift your rear off the floor. Then, straighten your back and maintain a straight line from your shoulder to your knees. With your dumbbells in hand, put your hands straight out in front of you from the shoulder. Bring one arm down laterally so your elbow makes a ninety-degree angle, but keep your forearm in a vertical position. Your arm should come down and towards you as if you are opening a cabinet door. Re-extend your hand and arm to its starting position and perform the same movement with your opposite arm.

, Hold your dumbbells a few inches apart in a vertical orientation behind your head. (To accomplish this pose, imagine you had your fingers interlocked behind your head and have just started to unbind them and turn each hand into a fist.) Bending your elbows, lift the dumbbells up and over your head until your arms are fully extended above your head. Keep your back straight and your head facing forward throughout.

, Hold the dumbbell in your hands and stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Bend your knees slightly, then lean forward from your hips, keeping your back straight. Hold your arms straight below your shoulders, and slowly raise them until your elbows line up parallel with your spine. Slowly lower the weights back to your starting position, then repeat for the desired number of reps."

Bring your arms up into a fully extended overhead position (without ""locking"" your elbows). Be sure to keep a steady motion to avoid letting the bar extend forward or backward., When you are done with your reps, finish with the weight fully extended above you. Lower the weight slowly, bringing it down to rest in front of your chest, then extend it downwards until your arms are straight. Bend your knees to rest it back on the ground, then raise yourself back to a standing position., As you grow more comfortable, extend the reps to 6-10.

Consult your doctor.,
Choose a weight.,
Find a spotter.,
Watch for signs of potential injury.",How to Do a Behind the Neck Press3," It is important to check with your doctor before embarking on any kind of strength-training program, especially if you have a history of injury or illness. Ask if this kind of exercise will exacerbate damage to joints or muscles, or if it is safe given other medical conditions (e.g., high blood pressure). Once you start lifting weights, see your doctor immediately if you suspect that you are injured., As a general rule, you should choose a weight that causes muscle fatigue at around 6-8 reps. This will depend on many factors including your experience, body mass, and overall strength. Start with a lower weight to test your range and ease up to a heavier weight until you discover the right resistance for you., Having a spotter can dramatically reduce the likelihood of injury while weightlifting by preventing dropping or body strain. Ask a friend or fellow gym-goer to spot you, and offer to do the same for them. Be sure to choose someone that you trust and interact well with, as communication is key between spotters and lifters., After weight lifting, there is generally a recovery period of 24 to 48 hours. If you have aching muscles or sore joints after this time, or experience severe neck pain after weightlifting, contact your doctor. You should seek medical attention immediately if you notice a painful bulge in your abdomen, which could be a hernia."

Pat yourself on the back.,
Change the number of sets.,
Consider the number of reps.You can also confuse your muscles by increasing or decreasing the number of repetitions you do during any given exercise.,
Vary your rest time.,
Do your exercises in a different order.If on your chest and arms day in the gym you usually do curls, then chest press, then tricep dips, try mixing it up.,
Choose different exercises.If you already know some different exercises, then mix those in to your workout.,
Try pyramid training.",How to Confuse Your Muscles," This will help you keep everything in order, and help you keep track of what you’ve already done. The following plan is for six weeks. When completing the exercises, you should choose a weight that is challenging, but that will also allow you to complete the desired number of repetitions using good form.


If you want to increase your repetitions, then decrease your weight. If you want to decrease the number of repetitions, then increase your weight. Aim for two to three sets of each exercise you do.;
, It is best if you can have someone do this for you, as it is difficult to accurately measure yourself. If you do this, you will be able to retake your measurements at the end to see how far you've progressed.


You can have someone measure parts of your body (e.g. arms, waist, hips, legs, etc.) to see if you gain or lose any inches after you have completed the cycle.
You can also have your body fat measured by a personal trainer using calipers.

, For a total of six weeks, instead of your normal weight lifting routine, you will do something different. For the first two weeks:


Work out four days of each week; you can choose four days that are convenient for you.
On each day you will work a different area of your body.
For example, on one day you will do exercises that target your chest and triceps

On the second day you will target your back and biceps.
On the third day you will target all of the muscles in your legs.
On the fourth day, target abs and shouldersRepeat this pattern again for the second week.

, For the third and fourth week, you will, again, need to work out four days each week. This routine will be similar to the first two weeks, but different in that you will mix up which areas you work together.


For the first day of the week, you will exercise your back and triceps together.For the second day of the week, you should exercise your chest and biceps together.For the third day of the week, exercise your legs and shoulders.On the last day of your workout week, you will exercise your abs.Repeat this pattern for week four.

, For the last two weeks of your routine, you will stick to four days of working out each week, but the exercises will be mixed up yet again.Day one: back and shoulders.Day two: biceps and triceps.Day three: chest and shoulders.Day four: legs and abs.Repeat the pattern for the sixth week.

, You have completed your first cycle of muscle confusion workouts! If you took measurements of your body composition before you began, you should now measure again to see if anything has changed.


Once you have completed this round of muscle confusion, you should either go back to your normal workout routine or switch to a new, but consistent workout routine for the next four to six weeks. Your muscles need time to adjust to particular exercises, so switching it up too often can actually hinder your progress., If you are already working out regularly, and you know the exercises you want to do, you can simply change the number of sets you are doing.If you want to shock your muscles, take one of the exercises you normally do and just do one or two sets if you normally do more. If you want to increase muscle endurance, do four or five sets.Alternatively, you can mix it up even more by doing fewer reps for two weeks, and more reps for the next two weeks, followed by a decrease for two weeks.

,


For example, if you normally do 12 repetitions, do 15 or 18 repetitions, but with a lower weight than you would normally use.
You could also decrease the number of repetitions while increasing the amount of weight. For example if you normally do 12 repetitions with a 10 pound weight, try doing eight repetitions with a 15 pound weight.
Consider mixing these up for a few weeks at a time. For example, do 10 reps of heavier weight for two weeks, followed by 15 reps of a lighter weight for two weeks, followed by 12 reps of a middle weight for the third two weeks.

, In addition to changing the number of repetitions and the number of sets you do, you can also change up your rest time.For example, if you are planning to do a really tough exercise, you could try adding an extra 30 seconds to your rest time; this will allow you to really give it your all on your next set.
Keep in mind that you can also vary the amount of rest you take each week. For example, in week one, allow yourself 30 seconds of rest between each set, and then in week two allow yourself one minute of rest, followed by a third week of only 15 seconds rest.
On the other hand, if you want to increase your endurance, you could also cut some of the rest time out. For example, if you normally rest for one minute, you could rest for 30 seconds on your next set. This will shock your body because it requires you to move on with less rest time.

, You can still do the same exercises, just do them in a different order, such as in the reverse order that you would typically do them.


This is any easy way to mix up your routine because it doesn’t require you to think about how many repetitions you will do, or how much weight you will lift. You can keep all of that the same, or you can double up, and combine several ways of confusing your muscles. For example, changing your repetitions and doing them in a different order.
You can also keep the exercises in the same order for one or two weeks, and then switch it up to a different order for the next two weeks.

, If you don’t, ask a personal trainer to help you.


This is perhaps the most important way to keep your muscles guessing because different exercises work muscles differently.Try to stick with the same exercises for at least one to two weeks so that your muscles begin to adjust before switching to something new, and then mix it up with new exercises for another two weeks.

, Pyramid training is a highly effective way to structure the sets and reps of an exercise. Do your first set with a light weight and a high number of reps. Then, for each successive set, increase weight and decrease the number of reps.For instance, you may begin a bench press set with 15 reps at 115 lbs. The next set you might do 12 reps at 165 lbs., and so on.


You can also do descending pyramid training. Instead of beginning with a low weight and high reps, you start with your heaviest weight and low reps and work your way to a lower weight with more reps. This can help prevent muscle fatigue from setting in early on in your workout. Make sure you are warmed up before beginning descending pyramid training — jumping straight into lifting your heaviest weight can be dangerous. Always start this kind of training with a set using light weights to get the joints lubricated and the blood circulating.

Measure your height.,
Choose a ball that fits your height.,
Choose a larger ball if you have back problems, long legs, or for stretching and yoga exercises.

,
Get a 26 inch (65 cm) ball if you plan to use it in place of an office chair and your desk height is between 29 and 30 inches (74 to 76 cm).,
Note the pressure of the ball.,
Try yoga balls in different sizes before making your decision.",How to Choose the Correct Size Yoga Ball," Your knees should be at a right angle when you are sitting on the ball with your feet facing forward. Stand against a wall with no shoes on and your feet flat against the floor and wall. Use a pencil to mark the sport that the top of your head reaches. Use a tape measure to get an accurate measurement of your height.;
, Use your measurement to get the yoga ball in an appropriate size.


If you are 5 feet (1.5 m) or shorter (152.4 cm), you will want a ball that is 18 inches (45 cm).
If you are 5 feet (1.5 m) 1 inch (155 cm) to 5 feet (1.5 m) 7 inches (170 cm), try a 22 inch (55 cm) ball.
Get a 26 inch ball (65 cm) if you are between 5 feet (1.5 m) 8 inches (173 cm) and 6 feet (1.8 m) 1 inch (185 cm).
If you are 6 feet (1.8 m) 2 inches or taller, you will need a ball that measures 30 inches (75 cm).

,, Because the ball will deflate when you sit on it, choose a ball that has a diameter which is 4 inches (10 cm) larger than the height of the chair you are replacing.

, At its maximum diameter, a yoga ball is very firm. The firmer the ball, the more difficult the yoga and exercise will be.

, Sit on the ball and see if your hips and knees are bent to 90 degrees, with your thighs parallel to the floor.

Consult your doctor before working out if you are pregnant, have a chronic joint condition, such as arthritis, have a back condition, have previously injured a joint or if you are overweight.,
Start with low-impact workouts if you are new to exercise.,
Swim, water jog or take aqua aerobics classes if you have fibromyalgia, arthritis or a similar condition.,
Try walking, hiking or cycling if you like to exercise outdoors.,
Choose low-impact classes, such as low-impact step aerobics, Zumba or dancing, if you like to workout with other people.,
Do circuit training at a local gym.,
Alternate your cardio workouts, such as cycling, swimming or hiking with strength-training workouts.",How to Choose Between a High Impact and a Low Impact Workout1," These conditions usually mean you must choose low-impact workouts. High-impact exercise with these conditions will likely cause further damage and chronic pain.


In general, the older you are, the more you should lean toward low-impact exercise at moderate intensity. Older tissues do not regenerate as quickly, so joint impact can lead to injury or chronic health problems. If you are older and enjoy running or team sports, make sure to reduce the intensity as you age and alter between low and high-impact exercise.;
, Although you may work up to high-impact exercise, you should condition your heart and lungs using low-impact workouts such as swimming, cycling or fast walking.

, Water exercise lowers the impact of all motion because you are suspended in water. Check for local swimming or water exercise classes at a gym or community center.


Most pools supply water belts and dumbbells, which are important tools to use with water exercise. The water belt goes around your waist and suspends you in the water, further lowering the impact of motion and keeping you afloat. You can march, jog or bicycle with your legs in the deep end to achieve moderate intensity. The dumbbells can be used for resistance training for your arms, chest, shoulders and back.

, These exercises can create an adventure out of exercise. Make sure to wear shoes with good arch supports, and aim to do at least 30 minutes of exercise where your breathing is elevated.

, These classes should be taken regularly for best results. Avoid jumping motions, if they are included in the routine.

, This is a type of interval-based exercise that uses isometric exercises, weight machines and other exercise aids to improve strength. When done in succession for at least 30 minutes, it can raise your breathing and heart rate and be considered a cardiovascular low-impact workout.

, In general, impact refers to cardiovascular exercise, so strength-training or isometric exercises are usually considered no-impact exercise. The following exercises have little to no impact on your joints and can help to strengthen bones:


Yoga in most of its forms does not have an impact on your joints. However, it can increase balance and muscle tone as it relaxes you and stretches your muscles. Some types of yoga, such as flow yoga sometimes include jumps, which should be modified for low-impact to slow, steady movements.
Pilates uses your own body weight to firm and tone the core muscles of your body. This will help you to keep good form when you are doing cardiovascular exercises. Most pilates videos, classes and the movements themselves can be modified based on your health conditions and strength.
Light weight-lifting is a great way to increase muscle tone as you age. Make an appointment with a personal trainer to get advice about what weights and motions are appropriate for your fitness level.

Take a light jog.,
Exercise range of motion in your legs with butt-kickers and high-knees.,
Jump rope instead of jogging.,
Do some jumping jacks.",How to Warm up for Running1," Jogging even for 10 minutes will activate your muscles, increase your resting pulse, and put you in a better condition to run. Even taking a brisk walk before you go for a run can be an effective way of warming up.You won't be able to run or even stretch your best without getting your blood pumping and your muscles warmed up with light cardio exercises like the ones listed in this section.
If you plan on doing a walking warmup, keep your pace faster than normal and swing your arms as you would if you were really running.Jog or walk until the motion becomes natural. Avoid jogging for too long during your warmup; many runners feel some fatigue set in after about 25 minutes of jogging.;
, While at a moderate pace, raise your knees as high in front of you as comfortable to perform the high-knee exercise. Butt-kickers are the exact opposite: extend your leg as far back as far as comfortable so that it nearly strikes your butt.Butt-kickers and high-knee exercises are a great way to end your jog, though these can be done at any time during the warmup.

, You could also do this in addition to a light jog for extra cardiovascular conditioning. Beyond being an excellent cardio warmup, jumping rope will also engage your upper body and arms, preparing it for the run to come.While jumping rope, keep your weight on the balls of your feet and the swinging motion of the rope in your wrists (as opposed to your shoulders/arms)., Jumping jacks can be done pretty much anywhere, making this a versatile warmup for your exercise toolbox. But that doesn’t mean this exercise should be taken lightly! Your shoulder blades should be back, your spine straight, and your arms fully extended throughout."

Stability is the ability to maintain control of a joint in a particular movement or position. Possessing good joint mobility and stability in tandem will reduce the likelihood of injuring your joints, which you will need for bench pressing (and many other things)., Passive mobility refers to to being able to get into a position with the help of outside influence, and active mobility refers to being able to get there yourself. If you need a trainer, friend, or even a piece of equipment to assist you, that's passive mobility.It is okay to get into a position using passive mobility, but the goal is to eventually turn passive mobility into active ability through repetition.

, Start in a position lying on one side with your legs curled as though you are sitting on a chair. Extend both arms in the same direction as your knees are pointed. With the top arm, raise it in a slow, circular motion over your head until it has reached the other opposite side and extends at a 180 degree angle from your bottom arm. Then, bring it directly from that position back to its original position, this time straight over your torso instead of making the circular motion, until your hands are touching again.Do multiple repetitions of this for each arm until your muscles start to feel looser.

, Bring one arm all the way over to the other side across your chest. Use the opposite arm to press against it right above the elbow. This primarily assists the deltoids (the muscles around your shoulders).Hold this position for at least 10 to 15 seconds each time you do it, depending on how loose or tight your body feels.
Make sure you do this exercise for both arms.

, Stretch your arms directly in front of you and then with a sweeping motion, move them both out to their respective sides and all the way behind you. Lock your thumbs so that both arms will be evenly and identically elevated. With your thumbs still hooked behind your back, raise your arms to be as level with your shoulder blades as possible.Hold this position for at least 10 to 15 seconds depending on how loose or tight your body feels.

, When you increase your range of motion, you're adding additional ranges that you have never trained your joints for. If you try to lift weights as you did before in these new ranges, you may hurt yourself.Knock your weights down and gradually work your way back up. The process will occur much faster in the newly freed areas than it did for your initial training.

, Although getting your heart rate and general body temperature up with cardio is an important part of any warm up, you want to also target specific areas of your body that will be performing the most. This will more effectively prepare you for the tasks to come, which should help you to have a better performance and prevent injury from occurring.These activities will help activate your nervous system, increase your core body temperature, and further loosen sticking joints.

, Start in a basic pushup position: ideally, your weight should be supported by just your hands and toes and your face and body should only be an inch or so from the floor (not touching, but not too far away). Using your arms, push your body up as though you were doing a pushup, but continue to push further, pushing until your buttocks moves backward into what is often referred to as ""downward dog"" in yoga. Ideally both your hands and feet should be flat on the floor or as close to it as you can manage.Hold the position for a second before returning to the upward pushup position, then return to the downward push up position.This activity promotes scapular (shoulder) movement and loosens the shoulders. It's also helpful for the thoracic spine.Repeat this exercise 8-10 times.

, Stand facing a wall, about 2-3 inches from the surface, and pinch your shoulder blades together. Brace your forearms against the wall and slide them up and in a v shape. You want to go as high as possible, and then bring your hands away from the wall toward yourself while still keeping your shoulder blades depressed (that is, don't shrug). Return to the starting position and repeat 8-10 times.Like the yoga push up, this exercise targets the shoulder and spine again, but it also activates the ""serratus anterior muscle,"" which is a muscle that goes from the ribs at the sides of your chest to meet the scapula (shoulder blades)., Although some people say you need to have a partner for this exercise, you can use a wall to bounce a medicine ball off of instead. Stand perpendicular to a wall or a partner with one leg pointed to a 90 degree angle and the other in front at a 45 degree angle. Holding a medicine ball level to your pecs, pivot with your hips (moving your feet to go with the motion) to bring your upper body face to face with the wall or your partner. Using the momentum provided by your upper body, throw the ball, and catch it when it bounces or is tossed back to you.After catching the medicine ball, return to your original position and repeat this action 8-10 times.
You do not want to stand very far from the wall or your partner; the point is not to throw the ball a great distance but to be able to throw and catch it in quick succession to loosen your body and raise your body's core temperature.

, A general pre-workout warm up includes activities like stretching and cardio or aerobic activities. However, a pre-exercise warm up is just as important for lifting and should be used in combination with your pre-workout warm up. Even if you know you can bench press 200 lbs, it's better for you to gradually increase your weights to 200 lbs instead of doing 200 straight away.Once you get to your real work sets (that is, the actual exercise you want to do) that's when you should start off with your heaviest weight and then reduce.

, Because different warm ups have different intentions they must also have different goals to achieve those purposes. In the case of the pre-exercise warm up sets, you want to continue to prepare the target muscles, joints, and nervous system, but now you also need to begin to prepare yourself mentally for actually lifting weights and accomplish all of that without exhausting yourself.This means you should now move to working with weights, ideally the bench press if it's available.

, Starting with smaller weights, work your way up to the actual working weight you have in mind for your exercise. However, as the amount of weight you use goes up, the number of reps you do should go down. An example warm-up sequence might look like this:Begin with 1 very light set with light dumbbells. Do 10-15 reps at this weight.
Do 8 reps at 55-60% of your target exercise weight. For example, if your target weight is 100 lbs, you would use 55-60 lbs for this set.
Do 5 reps at 70-75% of your target exercise weight. Using the example from before, this would be 70-75 lbs.
Do 3 reps at 80-85% of your target exercise weight. Now you'd be at 80-85 lbs.
Do just 1 rep using 90-95% of your target exercise weight. Concluding with the example, this would mean 90-95 lbs.
If you do not have a pair of dumbbells handy, you can use just the bench press bar by itself for your first warm up set., Although you might think you can just go from one set to the other in order to get to your main focus, it is important to take a short rest between sets since you are increasing weights. This gives you a chance to breath normally, recover strength before beginning the next part of the sequence, change your weights, and even get a drink of water.Rest 45-60 seconds between every warm up set.

, You will want to make sure that while you are doing these exercises that you are maintaining the same good form that you use during your regular bench pressing. That means that when using the bench press your feet should be on the ground and your upper back and butt are both in contact with the bench. Make sure that when you bring the bar down, it is coming down over your chest (pecs) and not your neck or head., Someone who is planning to bench press more weight is going to need a longer pre-exercise warm up. The reason for this is that there is simply a greater amount to work up to. So, if you plan to bench press 250 lbs and your friend is only bench pressing 50, you should be doing more sets to work your way up than your friend., If you're a beginner to weight lifting, you will not need to do as many reps as someone who is more advanced. That's because beginners are generally weaker than their more advanced counterparts. To compensate for this, you might be able to eliminate sets 4 and 5 from your routine because they will be less important until later on.There is no set period of time or strength level to determine if you are a beginner or advanced weight lifter, and you shouldn't feel pressured to move to something heavier faster. Decide based on the progress that you're making: if you plateau on your beginner routine for a sustained period of time, that is when you should consider moving up to a more advanced routine."

Choose jogging or running, if you want to train or lose weight.,
Choose team sports, such as basketball, football, soccer, volleyball and even tennis if you prefer to workout with people.,
Do interval training, if you are attempting to train for a military boot camp, an upcoming sports season, a marathon or another race.,
Try a boot camp class, if you already workout but would like to boost your training or weight loss goals.,
Learn to cross-train between high-impact and low-impact exercise.",How to Choose Between a High Impact and a Low Impact Workout2," You should already be used to low-impact workouts of moderate intensity and be in good health. Pick shoes with good arch supports, cushioning and traction.


Jogging and running are popular, versatile workouts because they can be done outside or inside, on a treadmill. You will also meet weight loss goals more quickly through running than walking because the intensity of the workout is greater.
Start jogging or running short distances and increase your pace and your mileage slowly to avoid common injuries, such as shin splints, or medial tibial stress syndrome, and sore toes, heels and arches of the feet.

, Team sports can be excellent confidence boosters for children, teens and adults. They are a great way to enjoy a jovial, game atmosphere while you get your weekly exercise.


Make sure to wear all the protective gear that is recommended for your specific sport.

, You can contact a personal trainer or find workouts online that rotate jogging and sprinting. They help to develop your body both aerobically and anaerobically, increasing both speed and endurance.

, These camps are done for 1 to 4 hours at a time, and they include running, jumping, strength training and isometrics.

, For example, you should often alternate the days you do a high-impact workout, a low-impact workout and strength-training. This will give your body a chance to rest, and allow you to maintain your shape without injury.


Too much high-impact exercise is unhealthy for the joints. Many trainers recommend that you allow your body to rest a few days out of the week. You may choose to alternate with walking, swimming or no-impact exercise, or avoid exercise altogether 1 to 2 days out of the week.

Avoid overstretching before your run.,
Perform a few bodyweight squats.,
Do some bodyweight lunges.,
Warm up with mountain climbers.,
Kick like a donkey while on all fours.",How to Warm up for Running2," This is particularly important for static stretching, which is where you stretch out while stationary. Dynamic stretching, which uses an active motion (like a lunge) to fully engage a body part’s range of motion, is preferred for warming up pre-run.

Although there is some evidence that static stretching can have a negative impact on performance, dynamic stretching has no proven negative effects., Squats will engage much of your core while stretching out your glutes, which are often neglected when it comes to warming up for a run. Watch your form carefully; poor form when squatting, especially when doing weighted squats, can be harmful.Don't get psyched out by exercise terms - ""bodyweight"" only means that you don't use any extra weights, all you need is your body's weight (like a standard push up).
Generally, when squatting your feet should be about shoulder width apart and facing forward. Focus your eyes in front of you, keep your shoulders back, and maintain a straight spine.
It might take some getting used to, but this motion should be initiated by a folding of your hips into as deep of a squat as is comfortable., A variety of lunges will warm up your lower body best. Do 10 to 20 forward lunges to start with. Follow this up with 10 to 20 more lunges, but twist your torso to the left as you lunge with your left leg, and to the right on your right leg.Once you’re comfortable with the forward lunge and the lunge-twist, try adding 10 to 20 backwards and side lunges to your warmup routine., Mountain climbers will work your legs and torso. A set or two of these work great for breaking up more strenuous warmup exercises. A couple minutes doing this uninterrupted should be enough to warm up.


Add some variety to this exercise by doing the “doubles out” style: instead of kicking legs out one at a time, kick both out on each repetition., Well-stretched hips are important if you want to have the best run. One of the best hip stretches can be performed while on all fours. Keep your back should be straight, your shoulders above your hands, and your eyes be facing down. Fully extend your legs one at a time behind you.

As you reach a full extension with your leg, squeeze with the muscles in your glutes and hold the fully extended position for a few seconds before returning to the neutral position."
"
Build the intensity of your runs gradually.,
Maintain a short stride.,
Walk on your heels before and after running.,
Stretch your calves after running.,
Ice the painful area when shin splints occur.",How to Warm up for Running3," Pushing yourself too hard, especially when you’re just starting out, can be a major contributor to shin splints. Maybe start with a half an hour walk-run, and increase this little by little until you reach the level you’re aiming for.To keep yourself from finding a comfortable pace and slacking off, try to increase your distance and speed by about 10% every week., It may feel like you’re kicking it into high gear when you lengthen your stride, but this puts extra strain on your legs. Take extra care when getting back into the swing of running to reduce your stride length and decrease the likelihood of shin splints.

It’s especially common at the end of a race or workout to lengthen your stride when pushing through to the finish., When you run, your calf muscles get a work out. The same isn’t true, however, for the muscles at the front of your shin. Promote balance between these muscle groups and lower your chances of shin splints by walking around on your heels before and after running.

At first, this activity won’t likely be easy. Try walking around for 15 to 30 seconds at a time for about 3 sets., Sit on the floor with your legs extended straight in front of you. Hold either end of an exercise band or a towel and loop it around the ball of your foot. Pull back lightly until you feel the stretch in your calf.

If you don't have an exercise band or towel, stand in front of a wall with your feet placed 1 to 2½ steps away. Lean to the wall until you feel your calves stretch.
Generally, this stretch should only be held for about 10 to 15 seconds and should be repeated about 2 or 3 times for each leg., Even after taking every precaution, you might still end up with shin splints. It’s a bummer, but a little ice can take the edge off the pain. Ice your shins for about 10 to 15 minutes at a time between 4 and 8 times a day.Over the counter pain killers, like Ibuprofen or Aspirin, can also help alleviate some of the pain. Consult your doctor if pain persists for more than two weeks."

Stretch your lower back.,
Stretch your hips.,
Stretch your hamstrings.,
Stretch your calves.,
Stretch your plantar fascia.,
Touch Your Toes.",How to Touch Your Toes1," Many people don’t consider the muscle groups in their lower back when considering flexibility, but you can stretch these muscles to help avoid strains for any number of exercises. The cat-camel stretch is a great way to stretch lower back muscles. Simply get down on all fours and alternate between rounding your back toward the ceiling and pushing your stomach toward the floor while lifting your buttocks.Hold each position for 15-30 seconds at a degree where you feel a nice stretch but no discomfort.The alternating concave and convex postures will help stretch out several of your lower back muscles.









For several other lower back stretches, you can consult How to Do a Lower Back Stretch Safely.;
, A great hip flexor exercise consists of getting down on one knee as though you were proposing in a traditional fashion, and then leaning forward to put weight on the front leg to stretch glutes in the lowered leg.You want to hold the position for roughly 30 seconds before switching legs and completing the exercise again.








If you’re working on total flexibility, you can find other great hip stretches at How to Perform Hip Flexor Stretches.

, Though stretching several muscle groups helps, you are most likely to feel the stretch of touching your toes in your hamstrings. You can easily stretch your hamstrings by laying on the floor next to a wall corner or doorframe and placing the heel of one foot up on the wall before slowly straightening the knee until your feel a good stretch without discomfort.Hold this stretch for 30 seconds before switching to the other leg and repeating.








Since stretching your hamstrings is so integral to touching your toes, you may also want to look at some of the other exercises elaborated at How to Stretch Hamstrings.

, Next to your hamstrings, your calves are the second largest muscle group you’ll feel while touching your toes. You can stretch your calves in a similar fashion to the hip flexor stretch, but this time remain stranding and keep the heel of your back foot firmly planted while leaning forward on the opposite foot.You also want to hold this stretch for 30 seconds before switching legs.









Make sure you don’t rotate your feet at all, and it may also help to brace against a wall in front of you with your hands.For this and additional methods for stretching your calves, you can consult How to Stretch Your Calves.

, The above calf stretch is also good for one’s plantar fascia, but in addition to this, you can also stretch these muscles by placing a hard ball such as a lacrosse ball or baseball on the floor under the arch of your foot and rolling it side to side and back and forth with your foot for up to two minutes.You want to place some weight down onto the foot in order to feel the muscles stretch but not enough to cause any discomfort.








, Once you have warmed up and stretched all of the component muscle groups needed to reach your toes, you should find it much easier to reach them, or at least get closer than you previously were able.

Reach for your toes.,
Try the butterfly stretch.,
Do side lunges.,
Straddle the wall.",How to Stretch Your Inner Thighs1," This very basic stretch helps lengthen muscles in the back of your thighs as well as the inner section. Remember to do this with pointed toes at first and then with your toes flexed. Hold the position still for at least 20 seconds. Don’t hold your breath while you’re stretching. Focus on long slow deep breathing, relaxing on the exhale.;
, Sit on your ground as if you were going to sit cross-legged. Put both your feet together at the heels and slowly push on knees with your elbows. Don't bob up and down by pushing harder with your elbows. Keep a constant pressure so that you feel a stretch and be sure not to hurt yourself. This is a great stretch for loosening the inner thigh, and it will do both sides at once, which is a huge benefit. , Take a wide step out with your right foot, bending your right knee to lower yourself down slightly. Hinge forward slightly from the hips, keeping your back straight, and push your bottom back. This will stretch the left inner thigh. Hold this position for a few seconds, before resuming to the starting position. Do it again, this time extending your left leg., Lie down facing a wall with your legs resting straight up against the wall. Spread your legs apart to a comfortable position. Gravity will stretch your inner thighs for you. Take ten to fifteen breaths before slowly coming out of the stretch."

Select the correct size.,
Find a suitable place to use the exercise ball.,
Brace the ball with rolled towels or a few pillows.,
Pay attention to your breathing.",How to Use an Exercise Ball for Beginners1," Sit on the ball with both feet flat on the floor. Your knees should be bent at 90-degree angles.


Exercise balls are available in five sizes, and are sized in 10-cm increments, from 45 centimeter (17.7 in) to 85 centimeter (33.5 in). They are not sized in inches.;
, You should be in an open area and have plenty of space to move around. All sharp and heavy objects should be removed to minimize the potential for accidents

, Place the towels around the base of the ball to prevent it from rolling too much. When you get used to balancing on the ball, remove the towels. You can also ask a friend to hold the exercise ball for you until you get the hang of the exercise.

, You may find yourself holding your breath as you try to balance. Breathe normally during the exercise.

Learn how to breathe fully with your diaphragm.,
Practice your breathing standing.,
Practice a simple qigong movement in which the breath is coordinated with the movements.,
Finished.

",How to Use Qigong to Improve Health," This is the first step in learning how to do Qigong exercises. With diaphragmatic, or abdominal breathing, your chest is relaxed and your belly is relaxed. On the inhale for Taoist normal breathing, the diaphragm relaxes downward and the abdomen expands as a result. On the exhale, the diaphragm muscle contracts upward. The inhale and exhale should be of similar duration and the breath should also be smooth and quiet. There is no forcing of either the inhale or exhale. Practice this for at least two weeks for 15 to 20 minutes a day, sitting at first.;
, In the basic wu wei standing posture the feet are placed parallel at about shoulder's width apart, the hands are relaxed at the sides, the knees are bent slightly, the hips are relaxed, the tailbone is relaxed downward, the shoulders, chest and belly are relaxed, and the head is suspended as if by a string by the top and tilted slightly forward to create space at the top of the spine where it meets the occipital area. For the first 5 minutes of standing, practice muscular relaxation and for the next 5 to 10 minutes you can just follow your abdominal breathing. Over time, you will notice your strength improving and you can increase the duration of the standing time.

, One of the commonly used movements is the first movement of the Tai Chi, also called the commencement move. In this move, which starts with the wu wei standing posture, the arms naturally move forward and upward to shoulder's height and then go back down. The movement of the arms should trace a circle, going out as the arms go up and then towards the body after reaching shoulder's height. The hands need to be relaxed downward on the upward movement and they are slightly raised on the downward movement. The hands on the downward movement should be about 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the body. The whole body moves and moves centered on the dantian, or lower abdominal area, but the feet stay in place. You can shift your weight slightly forward on the foot on the up movement and slightly backward on the downward part. The inhale occurs on the upward movement and the exhale happen on the downward movement.

Lay on the floor with your legs straight out and your toes pointing toward the ceiling.,
Put your arms straight above your head.,
Complete a sit up.,
Touch your toes.,
Hold for 15-30 Seconds.",How to Touch Your Toes2," Now that you’ve done all of the necessary stretches, you can work on actually reaching those toes. Begin by laying flat on the floor with your toes pointed up.








, This may look as though you’re reaching for the ceiling, but some people find it easier to lower into the stretch with their arms rather than lunge them forward toward their feet.








, Stretch farther forward the way you would at the top of a sit up but without returning to the ground.








, Now that you’ve reached the full extension of your stretch, you should be able to touch your toes. However, don’t strain if you can’t. It can take several weeks or more of these various stretches before you can actually reach your toes.








, Hold the position for as long as you can without straining up to 30 seconds. You may also choose to repeat touching your toes multiples times as part of your exercise routine.









Always perform the exercise in a controlled, steady fashion and without darting your hands toward your feet because that will only lead to strains.

Squat down toward ground.,
Place your fingers on your toes.,
Raise your buttocks and straighten your knees.,
Hold this position for 15-20 seconds.,
Repeat it multiple times.",How to Touch Your Toes3," Now that you’ve touched your toes while sitting, try doing it from a standing position, which many people find more difficult. Begin by squatting down. This position will look like a frog-like squat with your knees bent and your back arched.







, Since this method requires starting with your fingers on your toes, then straightening your legs out after, put your fingers on your toes while squatting.









Some may find it easier to place their fingers under their toes in order to actually grip their toes instead of touching them alone.

, Stand up slowly, but keep your fingers on/under your feet.As you lift, you will especially feel the stretch in your glutes and hamstrings. Try to reach the point where both your legs and back are straight.








, Hold the position but don’t strain yourself. Additionally, if you can’t quite reach the point where your legs are straight, hold it at a position where you feel a nice stretch without discomfort. The full extension will come in increments with continued attempts.









Once you can easily touch your toes, the next step in this stretching exercise is to build up to doing it with your palms flat on the ground just in front of your feet as opposed to simply touching your toes.

, As with touching your toes while sitting, you may choose to do this stretch several times over the course of your workout.

Try the leapfrog stretch.,
Strike a wide-legged forward bend ‘E’.,
Try the lying groin stretch.",How to Stretch Your Inner Thighs2," Kneel down, place your elbows on the floor in front of you and try to spread your knees and legs as far apart as possible without injuring yourself. Make sure it doesn't cause too much pain. It should be a stretch, not a tearing feeling. If the pain starts to feel sharp at any time, stop. Sometimes called the ‘Frogger Pose’ this stretch isn’t too difficult to hold so you can stay in it for a longer period of time. , Stand with your feet spread wide apart. Hinge forward at the hips and place your palms on the floor in front of you. Keeping your back straight, drop your head to try to touch the top of the head to the floor between your feet. Move your feet further apart, keeping your weight on your hands. Try to keep your weight on your toes rather than your heels.
Also called Prasarita Padottanasana, this stretch is great for your hips and hamstrings as well as your inner thighs.

, Lay flat on your back again and press the soles of your feet together. This stretch will basically be like the normal butterfly pose except you will be lying on your back instead of sitting up. Press your knees to open your legs up, moving your knees away from each other and as close to the floor as possible on either side. This relaxing pose will help loosen your inner thigh. "

Wear comfortable shorts and/or flexible pants.,
Use shoes or go barefoot.,
Commit some time to stretching.,
Don’t stretch first thing in the morning.",How to Stretch Your Inner Thighs3," Be able to freely move your body, stretching is next to impossible if you’re wearing jeans or some other restrictive material. If you’re alone you can go ahead and do it in your underwear, just wear something that doesn’t restrict the mobility of your hips and legs.

, Being only in socks can make you slip and pull a muscle. Especially when you’re pressing both feet against each other or trying to hold a certain stance while standing up, it’s better to have sturdy footing. Lose the socks.

, Don’t expect to fix everything in two minutes. Commit at least 15-20 minutes to doing a variety of stretches, and try to keep that up every day.

, Especially if you have a lower back injury, this can exacerbate the problem if you don’t give your body time to warm up a little bit. Wait at least an hour after waking up before you start. "

Do cardio 3-5 days each week.,
Do lateral step-up squat presses.,
Do rear lunge row taps.,
Do decline pushups.,
Do a seated cable row.",How to Choose the Right Workout for Your Body Type1," The endomorph, or hourglass, body type has difficulty losing weight, hips wider than the shoulders, and a pudgy appearance. People with this type of body might have an easier time gaining both muscle and fat., Circuit training consists of engaging in a wide variety of exercises each time you workout. Instead of only riding your bike, for instance, you might ride your bike, then lift weights, then go for a run., Multi-joint workouts are those that engage multiple parts of the body at the same time. For instance, when swimming, you kick your legs, turn your head, and move your arms in sequence. Swim and/or engage in other multi-joint workouts – like deadlifts, squats, step-ups, lunges, and leg presses – on a regular basis., When lifting weights, do 12-15 repetitions and two to four sets. Rest for 30 seconds between each set. Incorporate weight training into your workout at least 2-3 times weekly., Get 20-45 minutes of cardio each time you include it in your workout. On days when cardio comprises a larger portion of your daily workout, perform your cardio routine at about 50% to 70% of your maximum intensity. On days when your cardio comprises a smaller portion of your daily workout, perform your cardio routine at about 70% to 80% of your maximum intensity., To perform a lateral step-up squat press, hold a pair of dumbbells and stand to the left of a step. Place your right foot on the center of the step. Lower yourself into a squat by pushing your chest out, keeping your head up, and bending at the knees until your left leg is at an angle of approximately 135 degrees.Next, push up with your right leg and place your left foot next to your right on the step. Push your arms straight up over your head.
Step off the step to the right side and repeat, going in the opposite direction.
Perform three sets of 10 reps.

, Rear lunge row taps are exercises in which you hold a pair of dumbbells and stand before a step. Place your right foot in the center of the step. Lower yourself so that your right leg achieves an angle of about 80 degrees. Your left foot should remain behind you with only your toes on the ground.Reach down with the weights as if you’re trying to place them beside your right foot.

, A decline pushup is like a regular pushup, except you start with your feet raised. Place your toes on a step and put your hands shoulder-width apart on the ground. Keep your toes pointed straight toward the ground. Push up off the ground with your hands. Lower yourself to a point where your elbows form 90-degree angles.Repeat three sets of 15 pushups.

, Sit at a low-pulley cable station. Place your feet on the platform. Grab the machine’s handle with both hands using an overhand grip. Keeping your back stiff and straight, bring the cable attachment toward your waist. When you touch your waist, extend your arms slowly until they are straight.Repeat six to 10 repetitions of this exercise."

Determine if you have an athletic body.,
Perform multi-joint workouts.,
Do weight training at a difficult intensity.,
Do cardio three or four times weekly.,
Do curls.,
Do calf raises.,
Try wide-grip pulldowns.",How to Choose the Right Workout for Your Body Type2," Mesomorphs, or athletic, body types have shoulders that are slightly wider than the hips, a firm appearance, and proportionate limbs. People with this body type gain muscles readily and rarely gain fat., Multi-joint workouts work your whole body rather than just one set of muscles or limbs. For instance, instead of simply lifting weights, try playing a sport like tennis in which you must move both arms and legs. Other popular multi-joint workouts include lunges, bench presses, squats, and deadlifts., When training with weights, do a set of eight to 12 repetitions, then rest for 45 seconds. Do one or two more sets. Incorporate weight training into your workout routine two or three times weekly., Vary your intensity each time you do cardio. When you do low-intensity cardio, lengthen the time you spend on it to 45 minutes. When you do high-intensity cardio, reduce the time you spend on it to 30 minutes. Incorporate cardio into your workout three or four times each week., To do a curl, hold a dumbbell in one hand with your palm facing up. Keep your wrist straight. Bend your elbow to bring your hand close to your body. Keep your elbow close to your ribs throughout. Slowly lower the dumbbell by extending your elbow.You can sit or stand when doing curls.
Do three sets of eight to 10 reps.

, Calf raises are good for working the calf muscle. To get started, hold a pair of dumbbells and stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Let your arms hang straight at your sides and lift yourself up on your toes as high as possible. Slowly lower your heels to the ground.Repeat one set of 12 to 15 reps.

, Wide grip pulldowns require sitting at the wide-grip pulldown machine. Tuck your thighs beneath the thigh pads and keep your feet flat on the ground. Adjust the machine to an appropriate weight for you.Grab the bar. Lean back about 30 degrees. Pull straight down on the bar and touch it to your chest.
Do not lean back to bring the bar down. Only use your arms to do so, bending at the elbows with each repetition.

Do calisthenics as a warm up.,
Be flexible, focus on the stretching aspect only when you are warm.,
Watch internet videos of genuine dynamic stretching.,
Be thorough and move every joint in your body.,
For every joint, write every movement that you need to do.,
Place this list in your training room or at your desk, as a reminder to do calisthenic stretching and as a guide when exercising.

,
For each movement, do at least 5 repetitions.,
For variety, do variations of a movement.,
Time yourself, this routine should take between 6 - 8 minutes.,
Be sensitive to your body.",How to Supplement Your Stretching Routine With Dynamic Stretching," For example, instead of doing 10 to 15 minutes on a treadmill as a warm up, do a whole body calisthenics routine for half of that time. Do calisthenics for 5 minutes then go on the treadmill for 5 -10 minutes.;
,


When you have been inactive, do not focus on the stretching aspect of the movement, but on the movement itself. In the morning, after sleeping or when you have been just sitting for a long time are examples of being inactive.
When you have been active, focus more on stretching. If you are warmed-up from housework, washing your car or from walking, your body will be warm and stretching is safer in this state.

, Borrow or buy a book on exercising. Think of the calisthenic exercises that you had to do in school, in exercise classes and prior to a sporting activity. Search the internet for calisthenics and their variations.

, Make a list of every joint in your body. Use this list for starters: 1) neck, 2) shoulders, 3) elbows and wrist, 4) back, 5) hips, 6) knee and 7) ankle.

, Use this expanded list and modify it later to your liking:


Neck - front and back, side to side and turning.
Shoulder - vertical swings, horizontal swings, vertical shrugging, horizontal shrugging and rotating.
Elbows - bending and extending and twisting.
Wrist and Fingers - do a waving motion and clenching your fist.
Back - side bending, standing forward bending and standing backward bending.
Hips - standing forward leg swings, side leg swings, back leg swings, and front, diagonal leg swings.
Knees - leg curls, walking lunges and squatting.
Ankles - side to side and front and back. Do this standing on one leg and with your holding on to a wall or chair for balance.

,, The elbow is hard to warm up, do more repetitions. With squats and lunges, do not do many repetitions because this is a supplemental stretching routine and not a strength building routine.

, For the ankles, sit on the floor and do ankle circles. Instead of squatting, lie on your back and do a movement similar to a basic abdominal crunch.

, To use calisthenics as a workout increase the repetitions to 10 - 20 and the total time to 10 - 15 minutes.

, For example, when doing neck movements, note how you are recovering from the neck pain you got from sleeping with the pillow positioned differently, than you normally do, because you were tired.

Warm up before you stretch.,
Start with some basic stretching exercises.,
Breathe into the stretch.,
Push yourself a little further every day.,
Consider adding strength training to your routine.",How to Stretch Like a Contortionist1," It is important to get some blood flowing to your muscles before you start stretching. This can make it easier to stretch your body further. To warm up your muscles, just do about five to 10 minutes of cardiovascular exercise, such as walking or jogging.You can also try stretching after you have finished a workout, such as after a bike ride or after playing a game of basketball.;
, Doing basic stretches may not make you look like a contortionist, but they will help you to develop the flexibility you need to stretch like a contortionist. Try starting with some simple stretches, such as a:



Forward bend. For this stretch, just stand with your feet shoulder width apart and fold your upper body down towards the ground and try to touch your toes. Hold the stretch for about for about 30 to 60 seconds.

Quad stretch. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart and then bend one knee. Grab your foot with your hand and pull your foot in closer to your butt. You should feel a gentle stretch. Hold for about 30 to 60 seconds and then switch to the other side.

Chest opening stretch. Reach your arms out to your side so that they are even with your shoulders and then push out your chest. Hold this stretch for about 30 to 60 seconds.
Reclined leg stretch. Lie on your back on a padded mat with your legs on the ground. Lift your left leg as high as it will go without changing the position of your right leg. Grip your thigh or calf with your hands. Straighten your left leg completely, and hold this position for about 30 to 60 seconds. Then repeat with the other leg.

, While you hold a stretch, make sure that you continue to breathe. Taking slow deep breaths will help you to relax, which might help you to stretch your body further. As you breathe, you can also allow your body to sink a little deeper into the stretch.


Try taking a slow deep breath in through your nose as you count to five. Then, slowly exhale as you breathe out and count down from five. Repeat this breathing exercise as you hold the stretch.

, To increase your flexibility, you will need to make stretching a part of your daily routine. Try to set aside about 10 minutes to stretch different muscle groups every day and try to push yourself a little further every day to gain flexibility.


Try to keep track of how far you can stretch your body in each position. For example, can you reach your knees? Your calves? Or your toes when you do a forward bend? How far can you stretch your arms behind your back? You might want to jot these details down in a journal to help you monitor your progress.

, In addition to stretching your muscles, it is also important to keep them strong to be able to stretch like a contortionist.If you do not already have a strength training routine, then consider starting one to condition the muscles that you are stretching.


Along with 150 minutes of moderate cardiovascular activity every week, the CDC recommends that adults perform muscle training exercises on two or more days per week. The exercises should target all of your major muscle groups."

Find a tension band or an exercise strap.,
Do a shoulder and chest opener.,
Try a lateral stretch.,
Use a door frame to do a shoulder stretch.,
Lean against a wall for a shoulder stretch.",How to Stretch Tight Shoulders2," A tension band or resistance band is a great prop for opening up your shoulders and releasing any tension in this area. You can find tension bands at sports equipment stores or online.

Alternatively, you can use a cotton exercise strap, a piece of strong rope, or a thin towel as a prop for these exercises. Be sure that whatever you use, you can extend it over your head and grip onto it easily.

, Use the tension band to open your shoulders and chest. Hold the tension band in both hands behind you, near your butt. Shorten or ""choke up"" the band a little so there is no slack and your arms are spread just a little wider than your hips. Inhale as you drop your shoulders down and back, extending your arms back behind you slightly and stretching the band. Your chest should open out toward the ceiling.You can hold this chest and shoulder opener for 30 seconds. Then, release it the same way you went in. You may repeat this opener two to three more times to really stretch your shoulder muscles.

, A lateral stretch can be a good way to stretch your shoulders and your chest area. To do a lateral stretch, stand straight up and hold the tension band in both hands, pulling the band until your arms are slightly wider than your shoulders. Raise it above your head, keeping your shoulders down and relaxed. Inhale as you move your hands over to the right side.

Consider the activity you’re engaged in.,
Decide on your water needs.,
Account for the weather.,
Check the price.",How to Choose and Use a Hydration Pack1," Hydration packs are best for activities where you can’t stop or don’t want to stop frequently, if at all. If you’re running or biking, for instance, you probably won’t want to slow down each time you get thirsty. Plus, hydration packs offer pack stability that regular backpacks coupled with a bottle or water bladder cannot. If, on the other hand, you’re going on long hikes or canoe trips where you’ll have time to stop and reach for your water bottle, you might not need a hydration pack.Longer trips – multi-day hikes, mountain climbs, and so on – may also require more storage capacity than the average hydration pack affords.
Some hydration packs are designed for specific activities. For instance, the CamelBak Race Baku is intended for bikers.;
, Do you sweat a lot when engaged in physical activity? If so, you might need a large reservoir of water. If you don’t sweat much, or don’t plan on getting too thirsty during your workout, you might be okay with a smaller reservoir of water.Most packs are available in one liter (or 1.5 liter), two liter, and three liter varieties., If you intend to use your pack during the winter, you might want an insulated pack. Insulated packs also keep your water cooler than a regular pack during the hot summer months. However, the extra insulation will add to the cost of the pack., Hydration packs are available in a range of prices. Larger packs are typically more expensive than smaller packs. Assuming two packs have the same size but different costs, the expensive pack will generally be of higher quality than the less-expensive pack. Decide what your budget is before buying a hydration pack.Look for deals when shopping for a hydration pack. Outdoor equipment retailers often have sales during the holidays. Compare prices online, too.
Be prepared to spend $50 to $150 (US) on a hydration pack.

"
"
Find a pack that has a sturdy construction.,
Take into account the ease of cleaning.,
Decide if you want a pressurized pack.,
Consider the fit.,
Ensure your pack is not too heavy.,
Think about alternatives to the hydration pack.",How to Choose and Use a Hydration Pack2," You’ll want a pack that can take abuse, even if you don’t plan on being rough with it. Packs tend to take falls, knocks, and other damage that you might not intend. Look for a pack manufactured with ripstop fabrics – a class of woven nylon resistant to tearing and ripping., The water bladder included with your hydration pack will probably have an opening that screws open and closed so that you can fill it with water. But some hydration packs feature bladders that slide shut or need to be clipped closed.With screw-topped bladders, cleaning can be difficult, especially when compared to the ease of cleaning a water bottle or even a standalone water bladder.
The average opening of a screw-top water bladder in most hydration packs is only about three inches (about six centimeters) in diameter.
With bladders that clip or slide closed, you can often turn them completely inside out to easily clean them.If you use electrolyte/sugar mixes in your water, the tube and pack will need to be cleaned more frequently than one where you use only pure water. But eventually, every hydration pack will need to be emptied and cleaned completely.

, All hydration packs have a tube coming out of the pack so that you can drink the water within. But some packs have a second compartment within the water pack that squirts the water out of the pack through a pressurized system. In other packs, you have what amounts to a long straw, so that instead of squirting the water out of the tube, you have to suck it out.Some people find pressurized packs superior to non-pressurized packs because they can get to that last drop of water with minimal effort.
The other benefit of a pressurized hydration pack is that you can turn the pack to uses other than a source of drinking water. Hikers and climbers tend to favor these packs for their ability to spray mud off of hands, clean dishes, and clean up messy pets before they jump in the car or tent.Pressurized packs are more expensive and heavier than non-pressurized packs, but require less cleaning because nothing can backwash into the tube.

, Some packs resemble typical backpacks, while others are closer in design to a vest. Some have a bit of space between the pack and your back, while others fit far more snugly against your body. Some packs have straps along the side, while others have strips of fabric to allow for extra pockets and storage capacity. Most packs are also aimed toward either men or women, though there are a few unisex options available. Before you buy a hydration pack, try it on to ensure it is comfortable.Bikers, runners, and skiers might prefer a slender backpack-style pack.
Hikers and mountain climbers will probably prefer a pack with greater storage capacity.
Female packs will accommodate the shorter average torso length of women.
Be sure to get a pack that is sized properly for you. Sizes usually run small/medium/large.
Play with the straps and clips to find a fit that works for you.

, Hydration packs generally tend to be quite heavy. Don’t be deceived by their small size. When shopping for a pack, check the label for information about the hydration pack’s weight when filled. If you’re unsure or can’t find info about the pack’s weight, ask a sales representative.One liter of water weighs one kilogram, so you can also add the weight of the water to the weight of the pack to get the loaded weight.
Pressurized hydration packs are heavier than unpressurized hydration packs.
Packs that hold more water will be heavier than packs that hold less water.

, Instead of a hydration pack, you could use a regular water bottle and stick it in the pocket on the side. Alternatively, you could invest in a water bladder, which is basically the part of the hydration pack that holds the water. But unlike a hydration pack, the water bladder can be placed in any pack you want and removed to another pack if you later decide you want a different backpack.Most backpacks designed for outdoor use have a hole for a water bladder hose that allows you to easily poke the drinking tube of a separate water bladder through.

"
"
Fill the bladder.,
Rinse the pack between uses.,
Strap the pack on.,
Place the tube in your mouth.,
Clean your bladder.,
Clean your hose.,
Insulate your hose during winter use.",How to Choose and Use a Hydration Pack3," Unzip the hydration pack and fill the water bladder within. Some manufacturers require you to unscrew the water bladder, then fill it. With other types of water bladders, you might have to unlock the clip that holds it together at the top. Still other varieties of hydration packs feature water bladders that require you to slide open a locking mechanism at the top of the bladder. With the bladder open, fill it with clean water, then close it once it’s full.Use cooler water if you’re headed out for a summer run, and warmer water if you’re headed out during the winter.
Consult manufacturer directions for specific steps on how to fill your hydration pack.

, Make sure that you always rinse out the water pack before and after you use it. To rinse your water pack, fill it with warm water, shake the water around, and then empty it. Also, make sure to run water all the way down through the hose and out of the mouthpiece. Do this every time you use your water pack to help keep it clean.

, Once you’ve filled the water bladder, replace it within the hydration pack. Zip the hydration pack closed. Place your right arm through the hydration pack’s right-side strap, and place your left arm through the left-side strap.The process is similar to putting on a backpack.

, Bite down on the tube and suck inward, just as you would when drinking from a straw. The suction power should allow the water to come out of the tube. Swallow the water until you’ve had enough, then release the drink tube. Clip it to the hydration pack strap on your chest. Detach it when you’re ready for another drink.Some drinking tubes might require you to twist a valve on the bite piece open.If you have a pressurized hydration pack, you’ll need to build the pressure inside the pack by squeezing the pressure valve (attached to the air tube) eight to ten times before biting down on the drink tube., Depending on the model, you might be able to get a brush inside the bladder and scrub away with warm water. This is especially important if you’ve used electrolyte/sugar mixes in your pack. If you have an unusually-shaped bladder – like some of the vest-shaped hydration packs – cleaning the interior completely with a brush is impossible. Instead, you’ll have to swish some mixture of hot water and an antibacterial powder additive around inside, then rinse thoroughly several times with warm water.When you’re done cleaning the interior of the bladder, open it up as best you can and hang it upside down for several hours so that all excess liquid drains out.
Always consult manufacturer directions for cleaning in order to clean your pack in the optimal way.
Never use bleach or boiling water to clean the reservoir.Clean the bladder every time you use it if you’re putting sweetened drink mixes into the bladder. If you’re using only water in the bladder, you can get away with cleaning it once a week or even less.

, As with the bladder, drinking water only requires a less rigorous tube cleaning schedule than does drinking a sweetened drink mix through the hydration pack tube. Most packs offer a specially-designed hose cleaning kit (not included with the pack) to help you clean your hose regularly. You’ll probably need to scrub the inside of the tube with an elongated brush (similar to a pipe cleaner) and a mixture of warm, soapy water.Always consult manufacturer directions for cleaning in order to clean your pack in the optimal way.

, In below-freezing temperatures, your water will freeze in its hose. Many manufacturers sell specially designed insulation sleeves for the hoses, but you could probably get creative and cut a couple of long tube socks into a functional insulation sleeve for your hydration pack’s tube.Because the water in the actual bladder stays closer to your body, there is little chance that it will freeze.
Another tip to prevent water from freezing in the hose is to blow water back into the bladder after drinking when the temperature is below freezing. (This only works with non-pressurized hoses, of course.)"

Try out various foam rollers at a sports supply store or local gym.,
Determine if you will use your foam roller primarily for tissue massage or if its dominant use will be for exercises like balance and core training.,
Choose your firmness.,
Decide how often you will use the foam roller.,
Choose your foam roller size.,
Select a 12 inch (30 cm) round roller if you intend to transport your roller often.,
Identify your budget.,
Research your options in local fitness stores or on the Internet to find the best value for your budget.",How to Choose a Foam Roller," Most people learn to do foam rolling through a class or a personal trainer. These classes introduce techniques that can help you make the most of your foam roller and give you exercises to use with your roller.;
, Although it is not round and only rolls slightly, a half-round foam roller can increase your balance when you stand on it. It is often used by physical therapists to enhance proprioception after injury to knees or ankles. Proprioception is your body's sense of its parts in relation to each other.


Half-round foam rollers are also a good choice for an elderly person or someone with little strength or muscle tone. When laid with the flat side down, the roller will not move easily out from under them. Simply laying on a half-round roller in the area of tight muscles can release tension. The user can also move back and forth slightly as they grow comfortable with the roller.

, A decision of firmness should be based on your experience-level with the foam roller. Most foam rollers are color coded according to firmness. White rollers are the softest, followed by blue or green rollers of medium density and black foam rollers, which are the firmest.

Choose a white foam roller if you are just starting off with a foam roller or if you plan to use it for exercises. White foam rollers are often made of a piece of polyethylene foam and they are the least dense, so they will allow some movement between the muscles, bones and the roller. Foam rolling can be painful at the beginning because tight muscles are pushed upon with your full body weight. A white foam roller will produce less pressure and less pain.






Choose a medium, lightly colored foam roller for advanced core-stabilization or a medium amount of massage pressure. These blue or green foam rollers are often made of closed cell polyethylene foam or EVA foam and they are common in Pilates classes.






Choose a black foam roller if you are very experienced using a foam roller or desire hard pressure for self-massage. Although most black foam rollers are also made of polyethylene foam, they are closed cell and manufactured under high heat, making them smoother, denser and less porous.

, For heavy use, it is recommended that you use a denser, black foam roller or EVA foam roller because they are highly durable. White and colored foam rollers made of polyethylene foam can warp over time in humidity and with repeated use. If you desire a softer foam roller, be sure to choose a brand that guarantees it will not warp.

, With the exception of half-round foam rollers, most foam rollers have a 6 inch (15 cm) diameter. However, the length of the foam roller differs, ranging from 12 to 36 inches (30 to 90 cm).


Pick a 36 inch (90 cm) foam roller if you intend to use it on your back. A long foam roller will allow you to roll with it perpendicular to your back, without fear of falling off the ends. It can also be used to create proper alignment by laying on it with the roller parallel to your spine, giving it full support.

, For example, you may want to bring it to a Pilates class and use it at home.

, The cost of foam rollers depends upon the materials used.


A 12 inch (30) white foam roller will likely be the least expensive, costing under $15 (10 euros, 9 pounds). White foam rollers cost less because of the lower density of the foam.
A black foam roller of any size is considered a professional-grade roller and would likely cost around $30 (20 euros, 18 pounds).
EVA foam rollers are becoming more popular. They are often green. They are moderately firm and offer a more comfortable surface that is warm to the touch. They are advertised as being more durable than polyethylene foam rollers but will likely cost up to $45 (31 euros, 27 dollars).

, Buy your foam roller.

Use antioxidants to enhance recovery.",How to Choose Post‐Workout Recovery Drinks," Strenuous exercise causes your body to lose a significant amount of fluids. Failure to properly hydrate yourself during and after your workout can have a detrimental effect on your recovery.If you're unsure about your hydration needs, weigh yourself immediately before and immediately after exercise. The difference between your weight before and after your workout is the amount of fluids you lost during your workout. This represents the amount of fluid you must replenish to remain fully hydrated. For every pound of fluid lost, drink between 20 and 24 ounces (600 to 700 ml) of fluid to replenish it.Keep in mind that your fluid loss should never be more than 2 percent of your body weight. At that level, you're not maintaining safe hydration levels during your workout, and are at risk for injury.
If you've decided to rehydrate with a sports drink, check the label for added sugars. Sugar can derail the recovery process.;
, Electrolytes, including calcium, potassium, and sodium, are crucial for post-workout recovery. They regulate the flow of other nutrients to your cells, as well as allowing your heart, circulatory, and nervous systems to function properly.Bananas are a good source of potassium, and can easily be blended into a post-workout recovery drink.
You typically will find adequate electrolytes in commercial sports drinks; however, you shouldn't have one of these sports drinks alone for post-workout recovery, as they may lack other nutrients your body needs.
Green juice from fruits and vegetables or coconut water also contains plentiful electrolytes. These can be blended into a recovery shake.
You can buy electrolyte-enhanced water at any grocery store or health foods store. Sports drinks also contain electrolytes – but watch out for the sugar in sports drinks.

, Your muscles get much of the energy they need to work from stores of glycogen. These stores are depleted when you exercise, and should be replenished as soon as possible post-workout.You should be tracking your calories (and macronutrients like carbs) to ensure you are getting the amount you need to stay healthy without going overboard and gaining weight.


Generally, you should consume at least 1.5 grams of high-glycemic carbohydrate per 1 kg of body weight.
Important carbohydrates include dextrose and maltodextrin. You can buy supplements to blend into a post-workout recovery shake, or look for commercial shakes that include these carbohydrates.
Carbs are especially important if you are doing particularly strenuous exercise or endurance activities. Low carbs can result in increased fatigue and muscle soreness.

, For a post-workout recovery drink that you're consuming within 15 to 20 minutes after your workout, you want simple carbohydrates that can be digested quickly. For optimal recovery, you want to replace the carbs you've burned as quickly as possible. Complex carbohydrates take too long for your body to digest and may actually hinder your recovery.Bananas are an excellent source of simple carbohydrates, as well as many nuts and seeds. These ingredients can be blended into your post-workout recovery shake if you're making your own from scratch.
Nuts and seeds such as walnuts, pumpkin seeds, and flaxseeds are also rich in fatty acids, which provide energy to recover without requiring your body to burn too much fuel to break them down.

, Protein is fundamental to any post-workout recovery drink. A fast-digesting protein will get the proper amino acids to your muscles quickly, allowing them to rebuild bigger and stronger after each workout.Generally, you should include at least 20 grams of protein in your post-workout recovery drink. If you're buying prepared drinks, check the label and make sure they include sufficient protein.
You also can follow the ratio of 1 gram of protein for every 4 grams of carbohydrate. This ratio, which is based on your body weight, will ensure you're getting the proper proportion of protein and carbohydrate for your body's recovery.
If you're making your own post-workout recovery shake, consider buying whey protein powder.
Whey is a good complete source of protein and provides all the amino acids your body needs for an optimal recovery.

, If you're not interested in turning your kitchen into a laboratory of powders and supplements to mix for your shakes, 12-oz of 1% chocolate milk is a simple solution for a post-workout recovery drink.Chocolate milk has the right ratio of carbs to protein, and includes many of the vitamins and electrolytes that you need to replenish after exercise.
It is important to note that chocolate milk contains sugar. This gives it an effective ratio of carbs to protein (between 3:1 to 4:1) to speed up recovery, but it can adds calories, which is not helpful you are trying to lose weight. You can also try plain milk with a piece of fruit, which can help get you to that sweet spot ratio and is more nutritious overall.
Chocolate milk also will be a lot cheaper than investing in supplements and powders to blend into a post-workout recovery shake.
Although it may not be as precisely beneficial as a shake would be, it's generally all you need unless you're doing intensive body building or running marathons.

, BCCA stands for branched-chain amino acids. These amino acids are most critical to repair and strengthen your muscles after a workout. Leucine, isoleucine, and valine are BCAAs. BCCAs help your body to transition from breaking down muscle to repairing and rebuilding muscle. Whey protein provides all of these amino acids, which are the most essential to include in your post-workout recovery drink.
If you are a vegan or don't consume dairy products, you can get these amino acids from tofu or quinoa. Look for tofu-based protein powders to blend into your recovery shake. You also can get BCAAs from brown rice and hemp.

, Arginine and lysine are two amino acids that promote healthy hormone levels and reduce the hormone cortisol. Stress increases cortisol, which is linked to weight gain.You may not think of a workout as particularly stressful, but here the word ""stress"" refers to the physical stress you put on your muscles through strenuous exercise – not mental or emotional stress.
These amino acids may be particularly beneficial if one of the goals of your workout program is to lose weight, or to manage your weight after a significant weight loss.
Arginine can be found in turkey or chicken, as well as soybeans or pumpkin seeds.
Dairy products have lysine, which makes this amino acid easy to blend into a homemade recovery shake. If you're a vegan, add tofu for lysine.

, This amino acid provides fuel for your immune cells, and aids in immune cell repair. A healthy immune system is crucial to rebuild your muscles after an intense workout.You deplete your body's stores of glutamine when you exercise. Replenishing these stores quickly may be important if you have a weak immune system or are regularly exposed to viruses such as the cold or the flu.
If you're looking for whole food ingredients to add to a homemade post-workout recovery shake that will replenish your body's stores of glutamine, try adding cabbage, spinach, or parsley.

, Essential amino acids are those your body cannot produce on its own, making them essential in a recovery drink. If your body can produce amino acids on its own, it isn't necessary to go out of your way to include them in your shake. Some protein sources have better varieties of amino acids than others. For a post-workout recovery drink, you want to include amino acids that will promote the rebuilding and strengthening of your muscles.The nine essential amino acids are: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine.
While all protein provides some amino acids, not every protein source will have the specific amino acids you need for optimal recovery after strenuous exercise.
Whether you're buying protein powder to add to a homemade recovery shake, or buying a prepared commercial recovery drink, find out specifically which amino acids are included.
If you see amino acids with which you're not familiar, look them up to see what they will do for your body. If they don't assist functions that will promote more effective recovery, they aren't necessary for you to include in your post-workout recovery drink.

, Adding Vitamin C to your post-workout recovery drink typically won't hurt you. At the same time, it's not a necessary supplement, unless you have breathing difficulties.Vitamin C is an antioxidant that can help your body recover after stress, including a strenuous workout.
A Vitamin C supplement may be more important for your recovery if your workout takes place outside, or if you're participating in endurance activities such as long-distance biking or running.
If you already take a Vitamin C supplement, for example with a morning multivitamin, you may not need to worry about adding any Vitamin C to your post-workout recovery drink.

, Studies have shown a correlation between consuming tart cherry or ginger and reduced muscle inflammation after strenuous exercise.For example, a 2010 study conducted by professors at the Oregon Health and Science University showed quicker recovery times for marathon runners who drank a glass of tart cherry juice after they finished their races.
Tart cherry acts similar to non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as aspirin or ibuprofen.
Fresh or heat-treated ginger has similar properties to treat and decrease inflammation or muscle soreness caused by intense exercise.

, Creatine is favored by body builders because it can increase muscle mass by as much as 10 pounds and increase strength by 10 percent. You may want to consult your doctor before you add a creatine supplement to your post-workout recovery drink.If you are engaging in endurance activities such as long-distance running or biking, creatine typically won't provide you with any significant benefits.
If you decide to add creatine to your post-workout recovery drink, avoid consuming it in combination with caffeine. Caffeine may counteract any benefit you would realize from the creatine supplement.
Typically you'll buy a creatine powder supplement to add to your drink. These are available at health food and nutritional supplement stores. The amino acid is found in meat and fish, and is most prevalent in wild game such as bison and venison.

, While antioxidants aren't strictly necessary in a post-workout recovery drink, they promote overall health and can help increase energy and stamina.Turmeric, which commonly occurs as a bright yellow spice and is used in curry, is a member of the ginger family. This root vegetable has antioxidants that can decrease inflammation and assist in recovery.
Maca is a Peruvian root plant found in high elevations in the Andes. Its antioxidants maintain overall good health while increasing energy and stamina.
These foods and others are available in powdered form and can easily be blended into a post-workout recovery shake. Follow package suggestions for servings as well as taste in determining how much of these powders you should add to your drink.

Decide which room the treadmill will go in.,
Set your budget.,
Choose between a manual treadmill and a powered treadmill.,
Research quality brands.,
Look for the lowest potential maintenance.,
Find out if there is a maximum weight limit.,
Pay attention to the CHP rating.,
Look for the features you want.,
Take note of the range of adjustability.,
Look for a safety shut off.,
Test the treadmill.,
Try out all of the controls.,
Notice the stability.,
Get a warranty.,
Find out about delivery costs.,
Plan ahead for installation.",How to Choose a Treadmill," You need to figure out which room in your house has enough space, and get an idea what size treadmill will fit. Also consider who else might be using the room at the same time, as someone running on a treadmill may bother them.


Running on a treadmill can cause the room to shake sometimes, so you want to make sure the room you pick can sustain this.
When you have a finished or partially finished basement, this is typically the best option as it has the most sturdy floor and is often out of the way from the rest of the house.
You do have the option of a folding treadmill which saves space, but this is only a good option if you actually need the space it would take up. Otherwise, folding treadmills often lack the sturdiness of stationary ones.;
, As with most large purchases, your price limit will help determine what model of treadmill you can buy. It’s not mandatory, but you should plan to spend no less than $1000 if you want to get a model that is built well and will last.Higher quality models tend to cost between $1500 and $3000. Some models are available for lower than $1000 and may be a good option if you know you will only use the treadmill on occasion.
Your budget needs to account for potential shipping costs if you order online, or delivery costs from a store, and the price of a warranty, if you have to pay extra for one. It might also be good to budget for potential maintenance costs.

, You might generally think of treadmills that have a motor that moves the belt, but you also have the option of a treadmill whose belt only moves by foot power. These tend to be on an incline and the friction with your feet is what makes the belt move.


This is a cheaper option, and may be more durable, as there are less moving parts.
The primary setback of a manual treadmill is they can be harder to use. Since the belt only moves when you walk or run, this type can require more exertion on your part.
Another downside is that the steep incline may be too much for some users. You may not be comfortable, or capable, of walking or running on a steep incline for very long, which makes this type less useful to you.

, Not every treadmill brand makes the quality of treadmill you would want. Don’t look just at the price and certain features that you like. You want to choose a brand that has a good reputation and that people consistently speak highly of.


You can consult yearly buying guides which will list the best brands and also consumer guides which may review specific models.
Shopping sites like Amazon are a great place to look at product reviews. You can find reviews of multiple brands, and also of specific models of treadmill.
One thing to look for is whether or not a company has a return policy. If you order online and you end up not liking the model you choose, you want to know ahead of time if you have the option to return it. Even if you purchase in-store, you may find a reason to return it, too.

, With equipment like this, there’s no certainty it will run perfectly forever. Yet, you can pay attention to the likelihood of needing maintenance. This is something to look for in product reviews, and you can also find out from the manufacturer, or store personnel, about which models tend to need more maintenance than others.


If low maintenance is important to you, manual treadmill options may be your best bet. Having less parts tends to make them more reliable.
It’s important to remember there’s no guarantee, but if minimal maintenance is important to you, then make sure you keep it at the forefront when researching and selecting a model.

, Most treadmills will have a fairly high limit, but it is still worth paying attention to. If you are heavyset, you don’t want to end up buying a treadmill that isn’t sturdy enough to support you, especially if you will be running on it.This is something to look for when you research different models, but you can also ask the salesperson to check. If you can look at a manual or packaging for the treadmill, this information should be listed somewhere inside.
Online descriptions should include this, but you can also contact the manufacturer directly to gather this information.

, This stands for continuous horsepower, or continuous duty rating, and has to do with how hard the motor runs. The rating range is generally 1.5 to 3.0. If you will be running or using the treadmill frequently, you should get a treadmill rated closer to 2.5 or 3.0 CHP. This level of motor is better for running.If you know you will mainly be walking or only using the treadmill on occasion, you will probably be alright with a lower CHP rating.

, Treadmills offer a wide range of capabilities including programmed workouts, video input, audio input, heart rate monitoring, and fitness tracking. These should not be the highest concern, but they are important to pay attention to.It is said that boredom is one of the main things that keeps people from exercising, so you might put a high value on its video capacity.
Write up a list of features that you would like your treadmill to have, then prioritize which ones are the most important and which ones you’d be okay without. If you are planning a weight loss program, heart rate and fitness tracking may be more important than speakers for music.

, If you are a sprinter, you need to know that the treadmill can go as fast as you want it to. Conversely, if slow walkers will also use it, you need the lowest speed settings to be slow enough. If incline is important to you, make sure the treadmill can be made as steep as you want it.


If you don’t plan to run, you may not need the top speed to be very high. Similarly, if walking on a steep incline isn’t your forte, you don’t need that option either.
The specific needs of all the people who will use this treadmill are important to consider. If you have tall and short, heavy and light people, you need a treadmill with construction and settings that will cater to the whole range of people who will use it.

, Most modern treadmills are equipped with an automatic shut off, in case of emergencies. This is typically a clip you attach to your shirt so that if you fall, it pulls a string and stops the belt. This is especially helpful if you are elderly or have any balance problems.Some models may also have a button that is an emergency stop which is useful if you start to feel dizzy and can hit the button before you actually fall.

, You should not make a final decision on a treadmill without the chance to walk and run on it first. The details of the model and the specifications are good to know, but you need to check your own level of comfort using the treadmill. If it doesn’t feel right to you, don’t buy it.Some stores may not like the idea of you using the treadmill, but with a purchase of this size, you want to make sure that it feels right to you. They want to make the sale, so do your best to bargain with them to let you test it out.
Walk and run for at least 5 minutes.
If you plan to order online, you won’t have the option of testing it in the store. Be creative to find a way to test one out. Maybe a friend, a specific gym in town, or a hotel has the model you are looking at and would let you test it out.

, The controls should be intuitive when you first step on the treadmill, but they should also be easy to manipulate while you are in motion. While running, adjust the speed and incline settings to gauge the ease of use. Try other settings to see what you can change while you are running.


Some models may have buttons or switches that are great when you are standing still but are harder to use once you are moving. Since you are likely to operate the controls while you run, it’s important that you’re able to.
Also take note of the size of the buttons. If they are small or close together, you may have a hard time pushing them while you run. You don’t want to accidentally push the wrong button because of how they controls are set up.
If you can’t test it in the store, you could find a way to ask people online how they feel about the controls. Wherever you look at product reviews, discuss this and other aspects of the treadmill with an online community who owns the product.

, When you run on the treadmill, you want it to be sturdy and not shake or bounce with every step you take. Better treadmills tend to have solid construction that keeps them from bouncing too much. This may be called “shock absorption” in the description.


If the treadmill bounces a lot it may break down faster. It will also be less comfortable to run on and may cause pain in your knees or legs.
The treadmill’s shock absorption should fall in the middle of too spongy so that you bounce with every step, and too hard so that it feels like running on concrete. The treadmill should have a little bit of give, but still feel firm with each footfall.

, Different treadmill brands will have different warranty policies, which is another reason to find out about the brand before you buy. Make sure you are very clear on what the warranty covers and how long it lasts.Be skeptical about ones that only include a 90 day warranty, as this could be a sign that it’s not a high quality product. A 10 year warranty is a good indicator that the manufacturing company does not intend for the product to break down any time soon.
If the salesperson tells you a treadmill has a certain warranty, make sure they double check their information directly from the company. You don’t want to go on their word and find out later that they lied or were just wrong about the information.
When you order online, this might be something worth calling the manufacturer, or seller, directly to be sure you are clear on warranty options. You don’t want to miss something in the fine print.

, You need to know if the store you plan to buy from delivers, and whether or not they charge a fee for this. Depending on where you buy from, you may be required to transport the treadmill home yourself. If another store has free delivery, this may be a better option.


If you will be transporting the treadmill home yourself, make sure you have a truck or other vehicle that the treadmill can fit in.
Even if you order online, if the seller is somewhere near you, picking it up to save on shipping is probably still an option. Be sure to look into this.

, Besides transporting the treadmill, you need to know ahead of time if you have to put it together yourself or if there is an installation option available. If you feel comfortable putting it together, then you don’t have to worry, but you may prefer having someone with experience put it together.


This is another thing to check different stores for. One store may have free delivery while another has free installation. You need to decide which option is more valuable to you.

Schedule a large run.,
Eat normally, or as you would during hard training in the week before you practice race.,

Make mental notes during your race about how you feel.,
Go easy on the fiber.,
Choose meals with high carbohydrate, but low fat.,
Eat plenty of sugar.,
Try some of the following foods to increase your carb load:


Bread, bagels or granola.,
Eat your carbs throughout the day.,
Buy gel packs and energy chews for the race itself.",How to Carbo Load," If possible, make this run at least 90 minutes long, or at least two-thirds of your upcoming race, so that you can recreate the same needs that you will have with your upcoming race. Most studies use races of 18 miles (29 km) or more to gauge the effect of carb loading, because this is the point when many racers hit the metaphorical wall., You will want to have 50 to 55 percent of your diet from carbohydrates during this time, since your body needs a good combination of fat, carbohydrates and protein to build muscle and increase endurance., It is important not to train too hard and use up the carbohydrates you are storing before race day.

, Although studies used to suggest that you should do this for two or three days before the race, new studies of London marathon runners have shown that the day before the race is the only day you need to change your diet to carb loading.

, Generally, there are four calories per gram of carbohydrate. Calculate your carbs by multiplying your body weight by four to get your ideal carbohydrate load.For a 160 lb. runner, this would be 640 grams of carbs or 2,560 calories. If this carb load were 70 percent of your daily diet, then your total calorie intake would be approximately 3,658 calories the day before a race.
Scientists also estimate that 700g (2,800 calories) is an optimal average number of carbohydrates, but few runners actually load that many carbs the day before a race.
Other sources suggest that you eat 85 to 90 percent carbs on race day. You can experiment to see if this works better for your body.

, Breakfast is important, but carb loading is exclusive to the day before the race.

, After you race, you should see whether the process worked for you. You can repeat this process several times before a race to fine-tune your eating plan.

, Too much fiber can result in an upset stomach during the race. This means you should not rely solely on fruit. Choose fruit that is high in carbohydrates but low on fiber, like bananas or dried fruit.

, It is harder for your body to convert fat to energy, so stay away from sauces or meals that are rich, buttery or oily. A sweet, sugary pasta sauce is better than Carbonara or Alfredo.

, Many foods that people are told to stay away from for health are actually ideal for carb loading. These foods include refined wheat, pasta, rice, honey, cookies and even cake.


If there is one day to eat sugary, carbohydrate-rich foods, it’s the day before a race.

, One serving is likely to contain between 40 and 70 g of carbohydrates.
12 oz. of milk. It contains 18 g of carbohydrates.
Energy/granola bars. They may contain 30 to 60 g of carbohydrates per bar.
Grape juice or other fruit juices. They can contain 50 g of carbohydrates per 8 oz.
Low-fat fruit yogurt. It may contain around 40 g of carbs per 8 oz. serving.
Brown or white rice. This is a great source of carbohydrate at 67 to 80 g per serving.
Baked potatoes. One baked potato has about 69 g of carbs.
A chicken burrito with rice and beans. This low-fat, high-fiber meal has about 100 g of carbs., Don’t overload during dinner. You don’t want to wake up full in the morning.

, Carb loading isn’t a cure-all. You will need to add to your carbohydrate stores with simple sugars during your race.

Figure out what size exercise ball you require.,
Determine what quality of exercise ball you need.,
Locate a store from which to purchase an exercise ball.,
If you can, test your exercise ball before you take it home.,
Once you've decided on your exercise ball, start finding out how you can utilize it.",How to Buy an Exercise Ball," How tall are you? The standard recommendations are as follows (your height first, then the ball's):


4'11"" to 5'4"": 55 centimeter (21.7 in) ball
5'4"" to 5'11"": 65 centimeter (25.6 in) ball
5'11"" to 6' 7"": 75 centimeter (29.5 in) ball
If you happen to be on the border between two height-ranges, you may want to try out both sizes before you decide on which to buy.;
, Not all exercise balls are designed for every type of exercise. Some are made for light use, while others are more durable for higher-intensity exercise. Look for the following qualities if you want to ensure that it doesn't break beneath you during a workout:

Burst resistant - This protects you from dropping to the ground unexpectedly if the ball gets pierced. Instead of popping, it will slowly start deflating, which gives you time to get off of it before you get hurt.






Able to handle higher weight - Remember that you may want to use free-weights while on the ball, so look for a ball that can hold more than just the amount that you weight on your own.






Holds up well to sustained use - You may think that you won't use it a lot over time, but you could find that even though you initially wanted to use it for an occasional workout, you end up having it as a chair-replacement at your office.







, Most sporting goods stores (e.g. Sports Authority, Big 5) carry exercise balls, and you can usually find them in the sports section of department stores like Walmart and Target.

, Exercise balls are typically sold without air inside them, but that doesn't mean there won't be any inflated ones around for customers to try out. If you do get the chance to sit on a few different exercise balls before selecting which ball to buy, make sure to pick a ball that positions your hips at approximately the same level as your knees.

,

For each exercise, you should have a particular area of the body that you're targeting--for instance, check out Do Sit Ups With an Exercise Ball if you want to focus on your abdominals.






If you ever start to experience discomfort using your exercise ball, return it to the store where you purchased it. You may be in need of a new exercise ball or to re-inflate the one you currently have.

Decide what kind of exercises you will perform with the band.,
Choose between a tube or strip design.,
Understand the different levels of resistance and select the best for you.,
Examine the distinct features of various bands.,
Plan to buy 1 or 2 bands or an entire kit.,
Visit an exercise or sporting goods store.",How to Buy an Exercise Band,"


Determine if you will use the bands as your primary method of strength training or as a supplement to an already established workout regimen. If you are considering using bands exclusively, you might need to purchase more than one.
Narrow down your search by specifying a need for physical therapy exercise bands or regular exercise bands. Physical therapy resistance bands have a more specialized purpose and are much less intense than other bands.;
,


Select a band with a strip design if you want to purchase the most basic device. Strip exercise bands are simply wide pieces of rubber cut to different lengths. They do not have handles, but they are the most inexpensive choice.
Settle on a tube design if you feel handles would be more comfortable or want to purchase a more durable band. Within the category of tube bands, you can choose between hard plastic and soft foam handles. Both types work; it is a personal comfort decision.

,


Acknowledge the 4 main levels. Light bands are typically long and thin and provide between 3 and 5 lbs. (1.36 and 2.27 kgs) of resistance. These bands are best for beginners. Medium bands allow for about 8 lbs. (3.63 kg) of resistance. Heavy bands can provide as much as 12 to 15 lbs. (5.44 to 6.8 kgs) of resistance and are appropriate for people who are already fit. The heaviest band, which might be labeled ""extra-heavy band"" should be employed by experienced users. These extra-heavy bands can provide as much as 20 lbs. (9.07 kgs) of resistance.

,


Look for features such as door attachments, removable handles, clips, ankle cuffs and rings. Some exercise bands will come with these extras.

,


Buy a starter kit if you are looking for a full workout. These kits will often come with instructional videos. Purchasing 1 band typically will cost between 5 and 10 dollars.

,


Inspect the band packaging, take them out and hold them in your hands. You should be able to tell if they feel stable and durable.

If you've just finished a workout, it's the perfect time to flex in the mirror for a while and check out whether or not your pecs are bounceable yet. It'll take a while, but you'll always have better results after a workout instead of before.;
, Basically, bouncing your pecs is just flexing your pecs, but flexing pecs that are sufficiently large so that the spasm is visible when you do it. If you're going to practice, do it right: go in front of a mirror in the weight room or in your training room, and remove your shirt so you can get a better view of your chest.


To maintain your muscle memory, it's a good idea to always practice in front of the mirror, so you combine the feeling of flexing with the effect that you want. It might feel great like you're Arnold-rescue, but it might not look like much.

, In the mirror, with your pecs well-exercised, stand with your arms straight down at your sides and attempt to contract your pectoral muscles. It should be a lot easier if you've just worked them out. If they're burning, you'll be able to feel very quickly whether or not you're doing it right.


Turn your upper arm (humerus) in toward your chest and you should feel your pec flexing. That's one of the functions of the pectoralis major muscle: rotating your upper arm.Don't worry about flexing them each separately yet, just worry about flexing them both on command. At first, it's hard enough to do just that.
If you're like most people, your pecs probably aren't something you're used to flexing on purpose. But, once you get a feel for where they are and how to do it, it can be as easy as flexing your bicep.

, The more you practice and work out your chest muscles, the closer you'll be to feel them enough to flex them separately. Try to isolate each of your pectorals, and flex them independently of the others. When you see something that starts looking right, stick with it and keep flexing until it starts bouncing like a jumping bean.


Stick with it and keep practicing. Some people have to weight train for a long time before starting to notice results like bouncing pectorals. If you can even flex them independently, you're doing pretty well.

, Once you've got it figured out, it's important to commit to keeping your chest strong and your pecs bulging. Pec bouncing is less a skill that you learn and more a product of having really big and muscular pectoral muscles. If you can do it, congrats. Now keep working out that chest.

, If you're not seeing much in the way of Hulk Hogan-style bouncing in your pectoral region, it's probably because your pecs aren't quite big enough to show yet. No shame. It takes a fairly large pectoral muscle to flex it enough to bounce in the way the bodybuilders do. That's what makes it impressive. Want to bounce your pecs? Keep working out.


Integrate chest workouts into your regular strength training routine. Even a single workout per week dedicated specifically to chest exercises can have your pecs getting swollen in a couple of weeks. Stick with it.

, Working out your upper arms and chest is the best way to get your pecs big enough to bounce. The best way to do that is good old fashioned bench pressing. Go high-rep with a manageable amount of weight to start burning those pectorals.


Depending on how experienced you are with training, it might be better to start with more or less weight. You ideally want something that will be challenging for all the reps you have to do, but light enough that you'll be able to do all of them. 3 sets of 10 or 15 reps with a short break in between sets is common.
It's also a good idea to work incline bench presses and decline bench presses to work your upper and lower chest, respectively. Use a similar amount of weight and number of reps to keep your pecs shaped., Don't have the gear to work out on a bench? Do what George Foreman did and workout your chest by doing pushups. Plyometric exercises like pushups, in which you use your own weight for resistance, are a great way of building muscle, as well as the fast-twitch response necessary to bounce those muscles. Do a few sets of a manageable number of push-ups, going as slow as possible to really feel the burn.


Wide-grip and incline pushups are also great ways of targeting slightly different targets throughout your pec muscle. If you want to keep it shapely and strong, don't do the same old pushups each time.

, By far the best way to build muscle in your pecs is doing dumbbell flys. Laying back on a bench with matching hand weights in each hand, raise your arms straight up above you, then drop them straight down to your sides, perpendicular to your body, keeping your arms slightly flexed. Bring your hands back up to meet to do a rep. Use a weight that will be challenging for the entire set.


If you have access to a weight room, you can use the chest press machine to do similar exercises from a seated position.

, Chest training needs to be a part of an overall, full-body workout, or it won't be doing you much good. Make chest training part of a full-body regimen.


Be very careful to avoid overtraining your pecs. Chest workouts should be a part of a complete, full-body weight training regimen, not an isolated exercise. There's no two-hour shortcut to bouncing pecs like Arnold.

, To build muscle in your pecs, workouts and a diet that emphasizes muscle-building protein are essential. Lean chicken, legumes, and vitamin-rich vegetables and whole grains need to be a major part of your diet.


You can work out your chest all you want, but if you're still eating cheeseburgers and pizza every day, that muscle will keep getting bigger under a layer of fat, making your chest look round, and making your pecs bounces invisible.

Consult your doctor before beginning any exercise program.,
Warm up first.,
Pedal for 20 minutes.,
Record your heart rate while cycling and then subtract 20 beats from your average heart rate.,
Calculate your fat-burning zone manually if you cannot bike.,
Consider buying a heart rate monitor.",How to Burn Fat While Walking1," Before you begin developing a walking regimen, it is important that you consult your doctor. This is especially important if you have preexisting medical problems such as a heart condition.;
, In order to burn fat while walking, you need to calculate your fat-burning zone — or the heart rate at which you are likely to burn more fat. Start by warming up on a bicycle for 10 minutes. An indoor bicycle is best, but an outdoor bicycle will work as well., After your warm up, cycle for an additional 20 minutes at the highest pace you can maintain for this duration. Don’t overdo it. Your legs should burn and your breathing should be hard, but you need to be able to maintain this pace for the full 20 minutes.If you are on an indoor bicycle, aim for between 70 and 90 RPM.

, Use either the handles on the stationary bike or a heart rate monitor to record your average heart rate during the 20 minutes you are cycling at your maximum sustainable pace. After you subtract 20 beats, add three beats from the number to get the high end of your range and subtract three beats to get the low end of your range. This is your fat-burning zone.For example, if your average heart rate was 160, then your maximum fat-burning heart rate zone is between 137 and 143 beats per minute.

, Take the number 220 and subtract your age. This is your maximum heart rate. Now calculate 50% to 65% of the resulting number. This is your heart rate for your maximum fat-burning zone., While many treadmills, stationary bicycles, and exercise machines have built-in heart rate monitors, it can be difficult to track your heart rate if walking outside. Purchasing a heart rate monitor, while unnecessary, can help you make sure you’re walking in your fat-burning heart rate zone.You can also check your heart rate manually by placing your two fingers over your radial artery. Once you feel your pulse, count the number of times it beats during 15 seconds and multiply this by 4 to calculate your heartbeat per minute.

"
"
Aim for at least 45 minutes of walking in your fat-burning zone.,
Warm up for 10 minutes.,
Increase your pace to reach the fat-burning zone.,
Walk in the fat-burning zone for 30 to 50 minutes.,
Cool down for 10 minutes by walking at a slower pace.,
Stretch after cooling down.",How to Burn Fat While Walking2," Once you’ve figured out your heart rate zone for burning fat, it’s important that you set aside time to walk for at least 45 minutes in this zone three to five times per week. Walking more minutes will help you burn more fat.Be sure to consult a doctor before starting this or any exercise program. This is especially important if you are sedentary or have preexisting health conditions.

, Each fat-burning walking workout should include at least 10 minutes of walking at an easy pace. This will warm up your joints and muscles. A proper warm up can also help burn off glycogen stored in your muscles.

, Once you’ve warmed up at an easy pace for at least 10 minutes, pick up the pace! Walk more briskly until you reach your fat-burning heart rate zone. You should be breathing heavier than you did during the warm up, feel more physical exertion, and be sweating a little. You might also find it hard to carry on a conversation.

, Once you’ve warmed up and have picked up the pace, spend at least 30 but preferably 45 to 50 minutes walking in your fat-burning zone. Keep your pace steady, but don’t overdo it. If you start to feel faint or have trouble breathing, slow down and take a break if you need to.Check your heart rate periodically to make sure you’re remaining in the fat-burning zone.

, Taking the time to cool down is as important as warming up. Once you’ve reached your higher intensity walking goal of 30 to 50 minutes, walk for 10 minutes at a much more relaxed pace., After you’ve walked for 10 minutes at a slower pace, take some time to stretch your legs and arms. Stretching after walking is an important part of the workout and should become part of your workout routine."

Start small.,
Develop a weekly walking workout plan.,
Prioritize your walks.,
Find a walking buddy.,
Reward yourself.,
Remember that any walking is better than no walking.",How to Burn Fat While Walking3," When starting a new exercise regimen, it is easy to feel overwhelmed. You might think you don’t have enough time to dedicate to walking or you could feel intimidated by the suggestion to walk three to five days each week. If this is the case, start with one day per week and work your way up from there.

, In order to achieve your fat-burning goals while walking, it’s important to develop a training plan you can stick to. Go over your weekly schedule and choose between three and five days where you can dedicate time to your walking workouts. It’s best if you can schedule at least an hour on each walking day, but remember that a 10 minute warm up is better than no walk at all., It’s easy to get caught up in the day-to-day happenings of life and lose sight of your exercise goals. Make your walks a priority in your life by setting aside time to walk, no matter what. If someone or something gets in the way and you miss a day of walking, that’s okay! Just make sure you prioritize time to walk the following day., Sometimes it’s easier to achieve fitness goals if you have someone to walk with. Ask a friend, co-worker, or family member if they would like to start walking with you. This can help you be more accountable to yourself and it can also make walking more enjoyable.

, Burning fat while walking can be hard work and sticking to a regular walking plan takes dedication and perseverance. Try treating yourself for achieving your fat-burning walking goals. For example, if you complete two weeks of your walking plan, treat yourself to a new pair of sneakers or leggings. Try to avoid rewards that might undermine your fitness goals, such as unhealthy foods.

, If you can't commit to walking multiple times each week or if you can only commit to walking for shorter intervals, that's okay! Even if you don’t see a marked difference in your weight, any amount of walking will help you stay healthy and improve your overall health. A small amount of exercise is better than no exercise at all!

Get the right equipment.",How to Boost Your Health Through Team Sports," The CDC recommends that healthy adults aim for a certain amount of physical activity each week to maintain or even improve health. Playing a sport is a fun way to do this.


Most health professionals recommend that you do at least 150 minutes of aerobic activity each week.Aim for this amount between your practices and games.
This goal is easy to meet when you play a sport. For example, one soccer game may be an hour long. That's not even including the practices.
In addition, many sports require you to have a higher level of aerobic fitness. During practices or games, you'll most likely be alternating between high and moderate intensity activity which is great for your cardiovascular system.Tally up the total time you know you'll spend each week playing games, participating in events and going to practice. If it meets the 150 minute guideline, you don't have to be active outside of your team sport.;
, You may not think that playing a sport could help you meet the CDC's guidelines for strength training. However, many sports require strength training to get better or they may even include strength training in the practices.


Participating in team sports and their practices can help you meet the guidelines of having one to two days of total body strength training.Make sure between practices that you participate in strength training exercises for at least 20 minutes per session.
Sports that require bursts of running - like soccer, football or basketball will require strong leg muscles. In addition, sports like basketball or baseball require a good amount of upper body strength.
Practices may involve doing lunges, squats or burpees which can help strengthen and tone your muscles.
Again, practices should involve some strength training focusing on your back, shoulders, core, buttocks, legs, and arm muscles.

, Like many forms of physical activity, a team sport can help you maintain a healthier weight and it may even help you lose weight. Use this fun and social form of activity to help you achieve your weight loss goals as well.Be consistent with all the practices, games or events plus do additional training on your own. This will help you stick to a more routine exercise schedule and meet those recommended weekly guidelines. Over time, this is a great support for weight loss.If you're trying to lose weight, set a realistic goal. Even when participating in a lot of physical activity, it's still recommended to aim for a one to two pound weight loss per week.In addition, see if the entire team would be interested in following a healthier diet together. Together everyone will be active and eating well as a unit which can make following a diet or particular lifestyle much easier., Whether you smoke or drink larger quantities of alcohol, these unhealthy lifestyle behaviors can have a negative effect on your body and athletic performance. To stick to a routine practice schedule and to pull your weight on the team, you need to make sure that your lifestyle is healthy.
To start, quit smoking if you do. You need to be able to breathe easily and work your cardiovascular system and lungs at a high level. Give up smoking so that you can successfully improve your aerobic fitness levels.
Limit your alcohol consumption as well. Men shouldn't drink more than two beverages a day and women should limit their intake to one drink daily.Remember that playing sports are only one way to boost your physical health. You'll enjoy their benefits more if you extend your healthy habits in sports to other areas of your life

, Just as smoking or alcohol consumption can work against your sports performance, so can an unhealthy diet. Change what you eat and how you eat to support your athletic performance.Poor diet choices may lead to poor performance. You may be more fatigued or not be able to keep up during practice.
Skip foods like: fried foods, fast foods, processed foods, sweets, sugary beverages and alcohol.
Instead, focus on eating lean protein, fruits, vegetables and whole grains. A well balanced and nutrient dense diet will help fuel you through tough practices and help your body recover.

, Studies have shown that there is a positive correlation between sleep quality and exercise.Playing a team sport can help you get in the activity you need to get a solid night's rest.


When you exercise for at least 150 minutes per week (the recommended amount), you're able to fall asleep quicker, have a deeper and more restful sleep and sleep longer.
A team sport is a great way to meet those activity guidelines and get you tired out enough to get a great night's rest.
It's important to aim for at least seven to nine hours of sleep every night. This is needed for daily functioning, but also to make sure you're at your best for practices and events.To get this amount, try going to bed earlier or waking up later if you can.

, Some studies have shown that regular participation in a team sport can help boost your self-esteem and confidence both on and off the field.If you have self-esteem or confidence issues, use your team sport to help strengthen those areas. Regular practice on the field or court can help you build strength, endurance and a mastery of certain skills. This can help boost your confidence in your own abilities.
Consider keeping a journal to track your abilities when you first start a sport and every month as you play.
You may also want to track how your body has changed as you get stronger, tone muscles or even lose weight. You can track your weight or take measurements of your waist or hips.

, Exercise is a common method to help you relax, de-stress and unwind from a long day. But hanging out with your teammates is another great way to relax and de-stress.Use time off the field with your teammates as a source of support. Your fellow mates can be a support group and be a good place for you to vent and release stress.
Consider going out for a drink or a meal after a practice or a game. You can chat and relax among friends. It's a great way to bond off the field. Just remember to eat clean and limit your alcohol intake.
Schedule an event to see a movie together as a team. You could all grab dinner before or after and hang out while watching a good film.
Celebrate special occasions together as well. If it's your birthday or another team member's one year anniversary on the team, celebrate together.

, When you exercise, you'll often notice your stress levels decrease; however, when we stop exercising, it's often easy not to notice how our stress begins to mount again. In the case of exercise, seeing is believing; even at times when motivating yourself to stay active is a pain, you'll find that doing exercise often overrides this feeling by alleviating stress once again.

, Playing a team sport is a great way to not only meet new people, but spend quality time with old friends. Use your time during practice and games to get to know each other and bond more closely.


Consider asking your friends to join a sports team with you or make up your own team among a group of your friends.
Schedule in weekly practices and events that will work for everyone's schedule. That way, that social time will be a bit easier to fit into a busy lifestyle.
If you're interested in making new friends, joining a team sport is a great idea. You'll meet a whole new group of people and have the opportunity to really get to know one another.

, If you're not currently playing a team sport, but would like to start, look for local teams in your area. Talk to friends, family or do a little digging online to see what's available.


To start, consider what type of sport you'd like to play. Have you played something in the past? Did you play a sport in high school or college?
Ask your co-workers if there's an office league or ask friends if they know of any local sports teams.
Another good place to look is online. Look at your local YMCA, churches or fitness centers. These places may all have a local team.

, If you cannot find a local team sport or can't find something you'd like to play, consider starting your own team sport. This can be a fun activity to start.


Just because you can't find an established team, doesn't mean that there aren't any options.
Ask co-workers, especially if you work in a bigger office, if they'd like to start up a team.
Send out an email and see what sports people would like to try and if they'd be willing to join together to form a team.
You can also try getting your friends or family members together. It's a great way to socialize and bond as well as get in some physical activity.

, If you're thinking you can't join a team sport because you're not very athletic or not very good at sports, don't worry. There are options for everyone with or without previous experience.


You don’t need to be skilled at a sport. There are very casual, ""no-skills"" required sports that are great for people of all skill levels.
For example, sports like dodgeball, kickball or casual flag football are just for fun.
Also, remember that with time and regular practice, you will get better at whatever team sport you try. Just keep trying and working on your skills.

, After you've decided on a team sport, you need to make sure that you prepare yourself and get the right equipment. This will help you stay safe and have fun.


Many sports require some sort of athletic shoe. You may need cleats for soccer or high tops for basketball. Ask the team lead or other players what type of shoes you need.
Also consider getting a gym towel and water bottle. You'll definitely be working up a sweat and need to wipe your brow and cool down with some water.
Ask the team whether or not there is specialty clothing. Most times, general athletic clothing will work (gym shorts and a t-shirt). However you may need to purchase a team jersey for events and games.

Finished.

","How to Stretch for Splits, Scorpion and Other Positions","


For the first stretch, start by placing your feet just a little more than shoulder width apart, and lean down to touch your hands to the floor. Hold this for 30 seconds, before coming up and repeating.






After you have done this twice, repeat the same process, but leaning towards one leg, then repeat with the other leg.





;
,, Be sure your knee is over your ankle, creating a 90 degree angle, and that your back leg is straight, to ensure safe stretching.,


Then put your elbows on the floor and continue stretching; hold this for 30 more seconds.







, Use your opposite hand to grab your foot and pull it upwards, making sure your knee is still on the ground and your front leg is still sitting at 90 degrees. Hold for another 30 seconds.

, Push your hips forward by placing your hands on your front knee, keeping that knee above your ankle. Hold for 30 seconds.

, Point your toes and lean forwards, trying to keep your back straight, as well as trying to reach your hands to your toes. Hold for 30 seconds.

, If the pain becomes unbearable, stop immediately and only go as far as you're comfortable.

, Keep it straight and locked, with toes pointed. It is perfectly okay to not have your back leg straight to start out, but keep in mind that is what you're working towards.


Take deep breaths and imagine yourself sliding down with both legs straightened.






Hold for 60 seconds.







,, Your legs will be already warmed up, but your back is really going to need to be stretched for these positions.

, Once sitting comfortably in your splits, lean backwards to grab your back leg, hold for 30 seconds, repeat each leg.

, An easy way to warm up your back would be by doing the classic ""bridge"" yoga pose. This is done as follows:


Lay on the ground with your hands beside your head, fingers facing down towards your legs. Your feet should be on the ground with knees in the air.






Now, push up until your arms are straightened. Eventually, you should be able to get your legs straight as well.






Hold this bridge for 10 seconds, repeating 3 times, being sure to come down and roll out your back in between each bridge.







, This may seem repetitive by now, but practice makes perfect. For this one:


Sit on your feet. To begin, stretch upwards so that your bottom is no longer atop your legs, but you have kept your legs and feet in the same position.






Now, lean backwards, and aim to grab your ankles.






Hold for 30 seconds.







, At first, you may need help with your balance, so be sure to hold on to something if you have never done so before.


Start by lifting one of your legs off the ground by bending your knee and bringing your leg behind you.






Once you can reach, cup the outside of your foot with the corresponding hand, and pull upwards towards your head.






Once you can reach with the other hand use that hand to grab the other side of the foot to bring upwards towards your head.






Hold for 30 seconds, and remember to pull your scorpion upwards, not in front of you!







, Seen on girls doing it on the beach, in public, and wherever they can can make anyone jealous, but here is the stretch that can give you this wonderful asset, and all you need is one thing––a doorway.

,


Slowly, start sliding one of your legs up the doorway, as far as you can get it. If you have your splits, you should be able to get it straight with both legs straight against the frame.






Hold this stretch for 30 seconds.







, Hold for 60 seconds, repeat on the other leg.

, If you use these stretches daily, you should be able to become as flexible as you dream, but remember, you get what you work for, not what you wish for!

Discuss your health with a physician or fitness expert.,
Determine your fitness needs.,
Determine what type of bicycle you will use.",How to Bicycle Your Way to Fitness1," A health professional will be able to determine whether your current physical injuries or your medical history may contraindicate bicycling as a fitness strategy.


Unless you have trouble with your knees or a problem with vertigo, bicycling may be appropriate for fitness and weight management goals. If you do suffer from balance problems, using a stationary bike may resolve the issue, though extra caution will still be advisable.;
, If you are hoping to achieve significant upper body strength and toning, bicycling will probably need to be combined with other exercises. However, if your goal is low-impact cardio fitness, weight loss, a toned core, and a strong lower body, then bicycling will likely meet your fitness needs.

, Depending on the climate of your region, your financial ability to purchase a high-quality bicycle or gym membership, and your preferences for the type of biking you would like to do, your needs will change.

Road bikes and mountain bikes serve different purposes and will allow you to cover different types of terrain with varying degrees of ease. If you anticipate primarily riding in your neighborhood or on paved roads or trails, purchase a road bike. If you anticipate climbing hills or biking on rough trails, a mountain bike will be more appropriate.






If the weather or climate of your region does not permit outdoor cycling year-round, you may wish to invest in a stationary bike for your home, a gym membership for a facility that has multiple stationary bikes, or a piece of equipment that you can mount your regular bicycle to in order to cycle indoors without a regular stationary bike.

"
Make a time commitment.,
Set bike-related achievement goals.,
Aim for target heart rates.,
Customize your training plan for weight loss or muscle strength.,
Take advantage of unique bicycling opportunities.",How to Bicycle Your Way to Fitness2," Commit to at least 150 minutes of bicycle exercise each week in order to obtain fitness benefits, particularly for weight loss. Split your exercise over at least 3 days each week and stay in motion the entire time you are on the bike.

, Consider setting a distance, miles per hour, or physical route goal to work toward; this will help give direction to your routines and will help you know when you have realized your initial fitness goals.

, If your fitness goals include controlling blood pressure or blood glucose levels, strengthening your heart, or losing weight, invest in a heart monitor or use a stationary bike with the ability to track your heart rate. This will enable you to work out safely while also ensuring that you are getting enough of a challenge with your fitness plan.


If you have heart health problems, discuss your target heart rate for exercise with a physician. It is not safe for anyone to remain at the maximum target heart rate for extended periods of time, so alternate between elevated and maximum heart rates during exercise according to the advice of a health or fitness professional.
Your target heart rate will be based on your age, health status, current weight, and fitness goals, and will change gradually as you become more physically fit.

, Bicycling can help with multiple fitness goals.

If you are trying to achieve weight loss by bicycling, your regimen will primarily include cardio workouts. Your plan will include significant periods of breathless exercise, as well as interval training to burn more calories.






If you are trying to build muscle strength and balance by bicycling, your regimen will primarily include resistance workouts. Your plan will include routes and settings that are difficult to pedal, requiring you to build leg strength and balance, since you will be moving more slowly. The extra force required of your muscles to push the bicycle against greater levels of resistance will gradually increase your strength.







, Achieving your weekly total for bicycling time can be easy if you use a bike to commute to work, run errands, or spend leisure time with family and friends. Consider working bicycling into vacation sightseeing, weekend activities with the kids, volunteer activities through races for charity, and “green” initiative challenges at work or school.

Vary the degree of difficulty.,
Alternate between endurance and strength training.,
Add upper body or core exercises to your routine.",How to Bicycle Your Way to Fitness3," Do not push yourself to your physical limit with each workout. Instead, try interval training, distance training, and light bicycling once or twice each week to get in a variety of difficulty levels and to allow your body time to recover between stressful workouts.

, Switching back and forth between long distances (which require pacing and good cardiovascular health) and days of brief but intense exercise (which demands considerable muscle strength) will help build muscle and burn fat. Alternating types of training will also work the muscle groups differently to keep you from plateauing in your fitness goals.

, One of the simplest ways to get additional benefit from your bicycling fitness regimen is to add upper body or core strength training to your regimen while using a stationary bike.

Try bringing dumbbells to the gym to use while riding a stationary bike. Just be sure to keep your posture correct and to focus on maintaining balance and proper breathing.






Resistance bands will expand the number of upper body exercises you can do while riding a stationary bike.






Focus on tightening your abs and holding your shoulders in good posture while you cycle to help strengthen your core and shoulders. To work your abdominal muscles even further, place your hands behind your head and cycle slowly while twisting the upper body side to side gently, keeping abs tight.






Perform flexibility exercises while cycling, such as shoulder rotations, yoga sun salutations, butterfly movements, and other movements that help tone and stretch your upper body muscles.

Do a ""runner's stretch.""",How to Stretch Before Gymnastics," Don't bounce when stretching and perform each of the following specific order for best results.;
, To stretch in a straddle position spread your legs flat on the ground and pull down. Pull do the left, right and down to the middle as far as you can.

, Here you bring your legs together (flat on the ground) and pull down as far as you can.

, Bring your feet together with your legs bent just as in the picture. You can either flex your legs slightly or pull down as the other stretches.

, These go hand in hand. For dog stretch, sit on your knees, with your hands on the ground and stick your butt in the air. This should stretch your shoulders. Seal stretch is where you push your hips to the ground with your hands in front.

, These stretches help stretch your back. Do three, one with good form, one with your legs as close to your hands as possible, and one more just to stretch. After each one, tuck and roll your back out.

, This is where you put one foot in front and one foot behind as if you were taking a big step. Then bend your front knee so that your shin is perpendicular to the ground and your knee is right above your ankle. Slide your back foot as far back as possible but keep your knee in the same spot to prevent knee complications and injuries that will keep you from doing gymnastics. Tuck your toes under so that only the toes and touching the ground and your heel isn't. Put your hands on either side of you. This stretches your hamstrings that help with splits.

Do a single leg forward bend in yoga.,
Do an extended side angle pose in yoga.,
Do standing splits at the wall in yoga.,
Do foot rotations in 90/90 neutral back.,
Do ankle rocking with a strap.",How to Stretch for Free Running," The triangle pose delivers an excellent full body stretch. The pose also strengthens the legs and develops a strong back. As you rotate your body to assume the final pose, keep you head, butt and ankle in a straight line. Repeat on either side to stretch both sides of your body.;
, The revolved triangle will open up your hip joints and stretch your legs before your free running session. The “triangle” that you form between your front leg, side and arm should become larger as you perform the exercise, so that you feel more light and spacious. This exercise will require good strength in your back, so be careful if you’ve had a recent back injury.

, This pose will stretch your gluteals, hamstrings and calves while strengthening your core muscles. As you bend down, lengthen your spine and work to keep your spine straight. Lead with your sternum as you position your torso over your leg to focus the stretch into the back of your leg.

, The extended side angle pose uses every muscle in your body when executed correctly. The pose stretches your groin and hamstrings as well as resolving stiffness in your shoulders and back. In addition, many yogis believe that the stretch will cure stimulate digestion and increase stamina.

, Standing splits will stretch your body from neck to ankle. You will feel the stretch intensely in the hamstrings of the leg you’ve planted on the ground and in the quads muscles of your raised leg. When you become stronger and more supple, then you will no longer have to rely on the wall for support.

, These simple ankle rotations will help to strengthen the muscles that support your ankles and will keep your ankles flexible and injury-free. The forward stretch will also provide relief from shin splints while strengthening your calves.

, Ankle rocking will both strengthen and stretch your ankles and your calves. You can also perform this exercise while sitting on a leg sled machine if you want to increase the difficulty level. For further ankle strengthening, try standing with a barbell behind your shoulders. Stand on your tiptoes, then lower yourself down. Repeat the exercise 10 times.

Minimize static stretches before exercise.,
Perform heel flicks.,

""Open the gate."",
Get your heart rate up.,
Slow down gradually after a run.,
Stretch your quads.,
Touch your toes to stretch your hamstring.,
Stretch your shoulders.,
Stick to light exercise during next-day soreness.",How to Stretch Before and After Running," Many people use the words “stretch"" and “warm up"" interchangeably, but they serve different purposes. Stretches involve holding your muscles in place in a lengthened position. This loosens and relaxes your muscle, which may reduce running efficiency. Instead, prepare for a workout by warming up with the exercises below, or anything that gets your muscles moving.

Many athletes refer to warm ups as ""dynamic stretches"" or ""active stretches,"" as opposed to ""static stretches"" where you hold a muscle still.
Despite what you may have heard, static stretches probably do not help prevent injury.Over-stretching with static stretches may even increase the risk of cramps and pulled muscles.;
, Jog forward at a slow pace. As you run, bring your knee up in line with your hips, and bring your foot back to touch your bottom. Repeat this motion with alternating legs. You may gradually increase your running speed, but don't go beyond a moderate pace.

This exercise — along with the high knees, power skips, and lunges below — warm up all the muscles of your lower body. This is useful for all runs, but put extra focus on them before a long-distance run, as cramps are a higher danger.

, As you run at a slow to moderate pace, bring your knee up above your waistline. This is easier if you hold your hands and forearms out horizontally from your body., While jogging forward, start to skip with the aim of jumping as high as you can on each skip. Drive one knee up as high as you can with each jump, and lift the arm opposite that knee up above your ahead as well. Try to keep the skipping smooth, and aim for height rather than forward speed., Stretch your leg out and plant in on the ground in front of you, with your knee behind your toes. Slowly lower your body until your can easily touch the ground with your hands. Hold this for three seconds and return to a standing position. Repeat on alternate sides.

Lunges can be dynamic and static stretches depending on how quickly you lunge and how long you hold the position.

, Straight-legged scissors kicks prepare your legs for explosive movement, while ""running"" or ""cycling"" in the air warm up the whole suite of leg muscles., This stretch reduces tension in your groin and thighs, which is important for long-distance running but not too relevant for sprints. To do this, stand on one leg and lift your other knee to hip level. Rotate the raised leg out away from your body, feeling the stretch in your groin. Now ""close the gate"" by returning the knee in front of you before lowering your leg.Repeat with alternating legs., For any type of run, increasing your heart rate first will reduce lactic acid buildup, helping you run for longer with less pain. If you're blood's not pumping yet, finish up with some jumping jacks or jogging in place.

This step is especially important for sprints. Before a sprinting race, try warming up with five 40 meter sprints back and forth.

, If you've been running all-out, don't stop abruptly. Instead, slow down your running speed until you eventually reach a walking pace. This helps your muscles expel lactic acid, and helps prevent muscle cramps., Now is the time for slow, deep static stretches to help your muscles relax. Begin with your legs, standing on one foot and holding your ankle back against your bottom with one hand. This stretches the quad (front thigh) muscle on the leg you're holding. Hold for twenty seconds, then repeat with the other leg.

In general, try to hold each static stretch below for roughly twenty seconds.

, This is the muscle on the back of your thigh, which tends to get especially tense while running. Try to touch your toes while standing up or seated with your legs outstretched. Reach across your body to touch the foot with the opposite arm, then repeat on your other side.

Don't force this past mild discomfort, or you could tear something. Your flexibility will improve over time if you keep stretching.

, Although they aren't under as much stress as your legs, your shoulders do tend to tense up when you run. Bring one arm across your chest, holding it with the other hand. Hold twenty seconds, then repeat with the other arm., If you're sore the next day, your muscles need a little time to repair before they're back in top condition. A light jog or other light exercise can speed this up. That said, this delayed soreness is not due to lactic acid, so vigorous exercise will not make it go away, and will likely make it worse.Give yourself a rest if you're feeling pain."

Mix it up.,
Lie flat on your back with your knees bent and your feet hip distance apart.,
Press your weight into your feet.,
Interlock your hands as you move your torso and lower back up further.,
Release carefully.",How to Perform the Bridge Exercise," It's recommended that you use a yoga mat for this exercise, but any padded floor will do. You don't want to hurt yourself by doing the bridge on a hard surface. As you lie down, make sure to keep your knees bent and hip distance apart, and the soles of your feet planted firmly on the floor. Walk your heels back as close to your buttocks as possible. If it is easier, scoot your buttocks toward your heels. You'll need to use the strength of your feet and your glutes to help you lift up.;
, You can lie with your elbows turned inward and your palms up, just a few inches away from your hips to help stabilize your core. Draw your shoulder blades together to pull your shoulders back toward the floor. Alternately, you can also place your hands and your elbows down. This can offer you a bit more support and will protect your wrists as you lift up.

, As you do this, make sure to tilt your pelvis and to pull your belly button toward your spine to engage your transverse abdomens. Press your feet into the floor and lift your hips to the ceiling as high as is comfortable. Think of it as lifting your hips to the sky or the ceiling. As you lift, you should squeeze your buttocks to make them more firm, but not harden them too much.








, Do not let them splay out to the side or you can injure your knees and your back. Keep your shoulders on the floor to protect your neck. Remember to pull your shoulders into the mat as you lift up.

, Make sure to relax your rib cage as you do this. Gently lower yourself down, doing it slowly so you don't collapse onto your back and neck. Slide your feet down a bit until you are comfortably on the floor.








, You can repeat this three times to get the benefit of a good workout.








, Extend one leg straight and perform the same lifting motion. Make sure you hold your weight in the heal of the bent knee. Bridge up keeping your hips parallel.









Alternately, you can use the same position, but move your hips up for one second, lower them almost all the way down, and repeat this 25 times to get a nice solid workout for your core and your glutes.
Alternately, you can lift your hips all the way in the air and then just pulse up there for 25 seconds, 25 times, before bringing it all the way down and repeating the exercise for 2 more reps.
You can even do a bit of both, mixing up traditional lifting for 10 reps followed by pulsing for 10 reps.

, Your toes should point straight forward, and your arms should be out at your sides, just a few inches away from your hips, with your palms down. Keep your chin away from your sternum so you don't injure your neck when you lift off the ground.








, You'll need the strength in your feet to help your hips lift off the floor. As you do this, relax your glutes (your thigh muscles) instead of tightening them up, which may be tempting. As your hips come up, your shoulders and back should press down more deeply into the mat. As you lift your hips up, you should inhale to gain strength and energy.








, You should keep moving upwards until your middle and upper back are at the height of your knees. You can press into the inner edges of your feet to make sure that your knees and legs are parallel and so that your legs don't flop open. As you move your hands up under your back, interlock them and use the pressure of your hands to help you get a nice lift. You can press down and back toward your hands to get that nice, deep stretch in your back.









As you move up, you can lift your chin a bit away from your sternum, while pressing the top of your sternum toward your chin. Try to broaden your shoulder blades, creating a space at the base of your neck as you lift upwards. Just make sure to do everything gently to protect your neck; the movement of your chin directly affects the pressure on your neck.

, You have to slowly ease out of the bridge pose as you exhale, so you don't injure your neck and back. Slowly roll down onto your back without straining your neck and let your feet flop out to the side so you can rest with one hand on your heart and one hand on your belly. You can repeat this exercise three times, holding your bridge for ten breaths each time, or you can even move on to the full wheel pose, which is also known as the backbend.









When you come out of the pose, you can hug your knees into your chest and roll up and down a bit, massaging your back.
In yoga, the bridge pose is typically one of the last poses that you will do during a practice, so it helps you move forward into relaxation and prepares you to enter shavasana, the final pose of a yoga practice.

Warm up before doing these stretches.,
Select a reasonably high item in your house that it is safe and okay to reach up to.,
Switch it up.,
Allow yourself rest days if you feel you need it and if you aren't already quite flexible.

,
Switch to lifting your legs without resting them on anything.,
Repeat the lifting without support as often as possible.",How to Put Your Legs over Your Head2," A brisk walk around the house or some jumping jacks can be useful. Or, do a short dance, run on the spot or jump rope.;
, This might be a shelf, a chair/couch back, a window ledge, etc. Check that you can put your leg onto that with ease. This is not meant to be a hard height, it must be something that you can reach with ease for now. Place your foot onto the item and stretch the leg while doing so. Keep stretching while holding your leg on this height, keeping the stretch longer each time. Do this for each leg a few times a day for at least a week. This will improve your flexibility and increase your legs' strength.

, When it doesn't hurt at all to this anymore, aim a little higher next. Find a slightly higher shelf or ledge and practice the same routine until it too becomes comfortable and easy. Then raise the level again until your legs are stretching really high with relative ease.


Take care not to strain your legs.
For now, keep resting them on a stable object of some kind. Even the wall is fine if you can't find anything higher to rest on.

,, This is going to be harder as there is no longer a support, just your legs in the air. Work on lifting up one leg at a time, working on your balance when holding that leg in the air.

, In time, it will become easier until you can do this without feeling as if you'll lose your balance or that it's too hard. Just be sure to give yourself a lot of time to achieve this, as it won't happen overnight for most people. It may take up to a year to be able to perfect this, so practice and patience are much needed to achieve success.

Back stretches: Child’s Pose.,
Leg and feet stretches: These are very simple stretches that you can do anywhere.",How to Relieve Stress by Stretching," Sit up straight and keep your feet firmly planted on the ground. Place your right hand under your right thigh or hold the right side of the seat of your chair to secure your position. Then, lift your left arm over your head and gently place your hand on the right side of your head. Slowly bend your head towards the left side and hold this position for about 10-15 counts. Do the same for the other side. Neck Rolls. With your back straight (but in a relaxed state), bend your head forward. Slowly roll it to the right then let it drop back to its original position. Do the same to the left.;

Place your inner right wrist on the area just above your left elbow to keep your left hand across your chest. Gently apply pressure for about 15 counts. Do the same for the other side.

, Here are a couple of yoga stretches that help relieve stress: Upward Facing Dog. Lie down with your tummy on the floor. Slowly lift your head and upper torso up until your body weight is resting on your hands and on your toes. To maximize the stretch, draw your head back and lift your chin a bit higher while arching your back just a bit more. Downward Facing Dog. Get down on the floor on your hands and knees. Make sure that your waist is at a 90-degree angle with your thighs. Upon exhaling, slowly lift your knees off the ground until you’ve formed an inverted “V” position with your body. It is recommended to hold this pose for about 1-3 minutes before returning to your original position with an exhale.

, This stretches the lower back. You start by kneeling on the floor with the knees about hip-width apart and sitting on your heels. Then you bring your upper torso forward and down until you assume the worship position. Your hands can either be outstretched in front of you or at your sides. Seated Spine Twist. Sit on a chair with a back rest (no chairs on wheels). Cross your left leg over your right leg then hold the right arm or the right side of the backrest of the chair. Slowly pull your upper torso around, slightly twisting your body at the waist. Hold this position for about 8-10 seconds. Do the same on the other side. Waterfall Stretch. Stand firm with your legs apart, slightly wider than your shoulder width. Start reaching down then keep your arms parallel and hold them together over your head. Pull yourself down using your arms.

, Lunges. Stand straight with your feet slightly apart. Put one foot forward and slowly bend your knee on this foot, placing your full body weight on this foot while keeping the toes of the other foot connected to the ground. Hold this position for about 15 counts then do the same for the other leg. Heel raise. Stand with your feet slightly apart. Slowly lift yourself up on your toes and stay in this tip-toe position for about 10 counts. Then, slowly bring yourself back down on your feet.

You must be at least 18 years of age.
You must have completed and passed a CPR class.
You must have a high school diploma or GED.;
, Many colleges and universities offer degrees in kinesiology, sports and fitness education, and exercise science. Getting a full degree in any of these requires several years, but gives you a comprehensive understanding of personal training and fitness. Choosing a certification program requires studying alone on your own time from a textbook, but is much more flexible and takes ¼ of the time a college degree does to complete.

, When studying to get certified, you must register with a particular certification group. There are many groups to choose from, all with different study requirements and payments. Just be sure that whatever group you choose is certified by NCCA.ACSM (American College of Sports Medicine) has certification programs in physical training and group exercise instructors as well as clinical training certifications. Their most basic course costs $355 for ACSM members or $415 for non-members including textbooks and testing. Their program is a work-at-your-own-pace certification, and allows you to choose your own test date based on your personal time requirements.ACE (American Council of Exercise) goes by the motto that they may not be the cheapest or the fastest certification program, but that they are the best. They are also the largest personal training organization in the world. They offer three personal training certification options: Standard at $499, premium at $599, and premium plus at $699.The NSCA (National Strength and Conditioning Association) offers specialized certifications in strength and conditioning in addition to personal training certification. Their program costs $270 for the members and $405 for non-members.
NASM (National Academy of Sports Medicine) has the most expensive but arguably most inclusive personal training certification. They offer your textbooks, testing (plus one free retake), live workshops, and a 90-day job guarantee for $1,199. For a charge of $1,999 you can get all of the aforementioned benefits with the addition of associate personal training experience., Depending on what you hope to do with your personal training certification, your requirements may change. If you plan on working in a gym or spa, check with those places to see what they require employees to have. Working out of your own home or through a small business may give you more freedom and lenience in terms of what education is expected.


In Canada Canadian Fitness Education Services (CFES) certification has been developed as an alternative choice for fitness instructors and personal trainers wanting to join others in the development of more comprehensive, academically credible and practical fitness leadership certification standards; have a national network of fitness professionals connecting with industry peers; and to advance career credentials.

, Most certifications require that you work from home, studying from a textbook. Although these are typically work-at-your-own-pace, they do have time limits. Usually, you are given between one month to one year to complete your studying.


Set up a strict study routine. This will help keep you from slacking off and promote better learning behaviors. You are more likely to remember what you study if you do so over an extended period of time rather than just cramming at the last minute.
Test yourself periodically. Some textbooks come with quizzes and tests, so be sure to do them to see how well you are progressing. If they do not, make flash cards covering the material and have a friend quiz you with them.
Practice what you’re learning. Studying physical education isn't nearly as helpful if you aren't physically engaging in the activities. Include time in your study schedule to practice the exercises and training that you've been learning about to ensure your complete understanding of them.

, Some programs have writing centers that you must visit in order to test, while others offer online testing. Research each program to find out what you must do in order to test. If you fail the test, you can typically retake it for a fee ranging from $150-$200.

, Once you've gotten your certification, you must keep it maintained by ongoing studying and learning. Physical education is constantly evolving, so you must be sure that you evolve with it. Some programs require annual re-testing, while others only need proof that you've taken certain online classes or visited personal training seminars.

, Acknowledge your personal strengths in training and promote those. Work in your areas of expertise and develop training routines around them. This will help employers to not only see you working at your strongest but place you with people who need help in those areas as well.

, Look into specialty training in personal fitness such as work in weightlifting/strength training, work with certain specialized machines and yoga. These will not only help you to learn more but make you more appealing as a personal trainer to others.

, If you find that you enjoy personal training, teaching classes to a group may be of interest to you as well. Many gyms don’t require extra certification to teach group classes, so it is easy to make this the next step. Some popular classes you might consider include spin/cycling, Zumba/dance, and different cardio workouts.

, Although it may seem daunting, starting your own personal training business can be rewarding and help you to grow as a trainer. Look into the business requirements in your area and talk to local personal trainers for advice for your venture."

Consider where you want to teach Zumba.,
Consider getting CPR certified.",How to Become a Licensed Zumba Instructor," Because Zumba is a trademarked exercise program, you will have to be licensed through the Zumba Academy.;
, The first step in attaining your Zumba fitness instructor license is to enroll in one of the following courses:


Zumba Basic Steps Level 1: This course will teach you the foundation for teaching Zumba. You will learn the four basic dance elements: merengue, salsa, cumbia, and reggaeton, and how to apply the various dance moves you learn to the songs you choose for your class.
Jump Start Gold: This course will teach you how to teach Zumba to an older audience, and how to target the physical and psychological needs of your students.

, Once you have completed the training course, you will be granted a one-year license to teach Zumba. This license will have to be renewed over time if you want to continue teaching.

, Licenses to teach Zumba last for one year, and should be promptly renewed upon expiration if you want to continue teaching.

, Before you can teach Zumba, you will have to first master the style and choreography of the fitness program. If you haven't already, enroll in a Zumba class and attend at least 3-5 days per week.


Be sure that you can keep up with Zumba classes of all different levels before you consider teaching a class. You must be in excellent physical condition to teach this or any other exercise class.
Take Zumba classes at different studios and with different instructors. This will help you pick up on the various techniques, and choose what kind of teacher you want to be. Pay attention to which classes seem to attract the biggest group of students, and notice unique elements (whether it is the dance moves, music choice, or overall energy) that that particular instructor brings to the table.

, Remember that requirements for teaching Zumba may vary between different studios and/or gyms. Some studios will accept a Zumba licensing on its own, but others may require you to have a group fitness instructor license as well.


Contact the person who is in charge of group fitness instruction at the gym or studio that you plan on teaching at. Set up a meeting with this person, and find out what certifications you need (if any) other than the Zumba license.

, While this requirement may vary between gyms, it is a good idea to be CPR certified if you are teaching a fitness class in the case of an emergency.


Register for a CPR training course through the American Red Cross in your area. Be sure to properly renew your certification as needed.

However continuous range of motion exercises and daily activities can contribute to smoother movement in and around the joints.


Stretching to relieve lower back pain is done by increasing the flexibility of the muscular structures surrounding your lower back as well as increasing the range of motion of the joints found in your lower back (including the spine and lower extremities).;
, Low back pain, which is referred to as LBP in the Physical Therapy community, is defined as chronic (long-standing) if the pain has been present for more than 3 consecutive months. This is chronic because normal connective and soft tissues in your body should take no more than 6-12 weeks to heal.


According to studies, there is an estimated 15-20% of the population with chronic LBP (cLBP) who develop protracted (longer lasting) pain and that CLBP is cited as the most common cause of disability amongst Americans younger than 45 years old.
It is the second most common reason for wellness visits and fifth most common cause for hospitalization and the 3rd for surgery., Almost all people can benefit from stretching the muscles as well as the soft tissues surrounding the joints (tendons and ligaments) – in the neck, back, buttocks and vertebral column (spine).


Your lower spine, which is composed of the vertebrae L1 to L5, contains the largest vertebrae in your spinal column and is an area where a lot of movement takes place.
The lower spine also bears the weight of the torso. This is the reason why, over time, your lower back receives undue stress and strain and physiologic degradation takes place., Patients with current and recurring lower back pain must realize that it takes months of stretching along with other back muscle exercises to achieve meaningful and prolonged relief.


However long it may take, it must be remembered that the goal of treatment and exercise is not just to achieve pain relief.
The goals are to sustain the pain relief and to further improve the condition of your lower back through continued physical movement and proper exercise.

, Warm up prior to a stretching routine by walking and gently moving your arms in a circular motion, as this helps to warm up your muscles. Stretching without warming up your muscles can cause undue strain to your soft tissues.

, Wear an exercise outfit that won’t hinder movement and that you feel comfortable in.

, One person’s range of motion is not the same as the next person's. Therefore you should, together with an expert or exercise coach, determine which range of motion is appropriate for you, and you alone.


Stretching should be pain-free. The old adage “no pain, no gain” does not apply in modern therapeutic and exercise regimens.

, Avoid “bouncing” movements. Instead, move into the stretch gently until your reach your end range of motion.


Bouncing involves small, repetitive, abrupt, high impact movements to reach the end range of motion. This is not beneficial because abrupt movements in your body cause undue stress and strain on your soft tissues.
Think of your muscles and soft tissues as a rubber band. If you stretch it hard and fast, there’s a tendency to break, but if you move it gently and slowly, there’s no danger of disrupting its flexibility.

, Perform your stretching routines on a flat even surface, or a spacious environment where you can move freely.

, Stretching regimens call for holding the position for more than 30 seconds for flexibility development. This is how you will develop and improve your range of motion.


You must hold the stretched position for at least 15 seconds (for beginners) and a maximum of 30-45 seconds.

, After holding the position for 45 seconds, slowly return to a neutral position (repetition 1) then slowly stretch back and hold the position for another 45 seconds before slowly returning to the neutral position again (repetition 2, and so on).


Do the stretching routine at least 5 times for beginners and as much as 10-15 times.

, Always remember to breathe freely. There shouldn’t be any point in your stretching regimen where you are short of breath or breathing heavily because this signifies that you are performing the stretch incorrectly.

, As soon as you get the go signal from your doctor or health practitioner, you can proceed to doing simple stretching exercises to help alleviate the pain on your lower back.


There are two common stretching exercises done to alleviate back pain. These are the Williams Flexion Exercise and the McKenzie Extension Exercise., Williams Flexion Exercise – this stretching regimen is a progressive form of exercise, meaning you have to do regimen 1 all the way through regimen 7. These are flexion or bending exercises aimed at decreasing the load placed on your lumbar spine.


By gently bending your back, you decrease the load or compression placed on the structures in your lower back due to long hours of standing, sitting, walking, running and lifting heavy loads.
At the same time, it helps strengthen your abdominal muscles – strong abdominal muscles lead to greater support of your lower back because your back won't have to do all the work when it comes to lifting heavy loads.
At the same time, doing these flexion or bending exercises helps to stretch the hip extensor muscles (the muscles of the buttocks) which also shorten due to over-compensatory motions in the lower limbs, which in turn lead to over-compensatory motions in the lower back that cause pain and stress.

, The pelvic tilt is a gentle stretching exercise that stretches the large muscles of your lower back without causing great stress. At the same time, it is a low impact, gentle exercise that helps strengthen your abdominal muscles.


Neutral Position – lie on your back with your knees bent and the soles of your feet touching the floor. Place your arms at your sides and let your whole body relax, allowing for the natural curve of the lumbar spine. This means that when you lie on your back, you can still insert your hand under your lower back because the lower back is slightly raised from the floor.
Inhale (take a breath) then, as you exhale (release your breath), slowly tilt your pelvis. You will do this by letting your abdomen (tummy) come toward your back or rocking your hips towards your face. If you feel your lower back start pressing into the floor, then you will know that you have performed this maneuver correctly.
It will help if you visualize that you have a bowl of water on your abdomen and when you do the pelvic tilt, the bowl will tip over and spill water on your tummy. Hold the position initially for 10 seconds, then return to your neutral position.
For strengthening and stabilization exercises, do the pelvic tilts in 12 repetitions, each repetition holding the position for 30 seconds then going back to the neutral position. Pelvic tilt exercises help strengthen the abdominal muscles which are generally weak in almost all people, especially those who have to sit at a desk all day at work and those whose work involves manual heavy lifting.

, This stretching maneuver will stretch the hip extensor muscles as well as the opposite thigh flexor muscles. Stretching these muscles will improve the flexibility of these structures which leads to the avoidance of over compensatory actions of the large lower back muscles.


Neutral Position – lie on your back with both knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Breathe in, then slowly bring your right knee to your chest and embrace or hold the position for 30 seconds. Do not force or pull your knees toward your chest while holding this position. This will cause undue stress on your knee joint.
Slowly bring the right knee back to the neutral position then repeat using the left knee. Hold the position for 30 seconds then slowly bring the left knee back to the neutral position (repetition 1). Repeat the steps with the right knee, and then with the left knee again for 9 more repetitions.
Remember to breathe slowly and deeply while doing these exercises.

, This exercise stretches the large back extensor muscles and muscles of the buttocks. Again, increasing flexibility of these muscles leads to a decrease in the over-compensatory mechanisms of the large back extensor muscles and relieves compression on the lumbar spine (lower back) by “opening” up the spinal disc spaces.


Start in the same neutral position as in the previous exercise. Breathe in then slowly bring your right knee to your chest. Do not force or pull your knee toward your chest while holding this position. This will cause undue stress on your knee joint.
While holding this position, slowly bring your left knee to your chest then embrace both knees. Hold the position for 30 seconds then slowly bring your right, then left knee back to the neutral position (repetition 1).
Repeat maneuver nine more times.

, This exercise helps to strengthen the abdominals. When the abdominal muscles are strengthened or developed, a perfect balance of posture and loading happens in the human body, which eliminates the need for the back extensor muscles to overcompensate for certain actions when standing, walking, running and loading (lifting heavy loads).


Do a pelvic tilt, but instead, hold the position while in pelvic tilt.
Slowly lift your head and shoulders off the floor or mat.
Hold position briefly then return to the neutral position (repetition 1).
Repeat maneuver nine more times.

, Stretching the hamstrings or the back muscles of your thighs can lead to greater flexibility in the leg and foot muscles. This is important as problems that start in the lower back will often lead to problems in the lower extremities because these structures will overcompensate in order for you to perform daily activities such as walking, running, lifting and standing for long periods of time.


Start with the neutral long sitting position. Do this by sitting on the floor or mat, with the knees straight and legs flat on the floor, with the toes “looking up” at the ceiling.
Slowly start reaching for your toes, keeping the knees extended. For shortened hamstrings, this might be a difficult maneuver to do at first. Remember, the goal is to increase flexibility of your muscles over time and not to touch your toes on the first try. So just try to reach as far and as comfortably as you can for your toes.
Once you reach a painful range of motion, stop and hold the position for 15 seconds, all the while breathing in and out. Also remember to keep your eyes focused in front and not looking at your toes. This puts an undue strain on your neck muscles which might result in pain afterwards.
Slowly move back to the neutral long sitting position. Repeat the movement nine more times.

, Hip flexor stretching allows for elimination of the “hunchback” posture, which is common in people with weak hip flexors (abdominals). If the muscles in this area are shortened or contracted, the person will often be seen walking hunched over, which will lead to further stress and loading on the back muscles due to improper posture.


Start with a neutral squat position. Squat on the floor with your hips, knees and ankles flexed, with the balls of your feet supporting your whole body.
Slowly bend over and touch the floor or mat with your hand, keeping the elbows straight. You will slowly transfer some of the weight of your body towards your hands and arms.
Slowly straighten your right knee and leg backwards, while keeping the left knee, leg and ankle bent. You will know that you are doing the right maneuver when your left knee is touching your armpit.
Slowly bring your right knee, leg and ankle back to a neutral position.
Repeat with the left leg back and right knee bent.
Repeat movement nine more times.

, This exercise stretches the muscles of the lower extremities and allows for stretching of the muscles in the back and buttocks too. It can relieve lower back pain by increasing the flexibility of both the back extensor and back flexor muscles.


Stand in a neutral comfortable position, with your feet one shoulder width apart and parallel to the floor. Maintain your trunk in a perpendicular position to the floor as much as possible.
Slowly lower the body by flexing your hips and knees fully until your hands touch the floor. Keep your face looking forward in order to avoid undue stress and strain on your neck muscles.
Return to a neutral position then repeat these steps nine more times.

, These may include:



Cat Stretch: Start in the neutral position, on hands and knees, with the head down. Slowly push your back up towards the ceiling, like a cat arching its back. Continue with this maneuver until you feel a stretch on your neck, upper back and lower back. Hold the position for 15-30 seconds. Return to neutral, then repeat nine more times. Or try:

Dog Stretch: Start in the neutral position, on hands and knees, with the head down. Slowly relax your lower back and tummy so they “sag” down to the floor. Continue until you feel a stretch in your lower back and abdominal muscles. Hold this position for 15-30 seconds. Return to neutral, then repeat nine more times.

, This is a stretching technique that allows for increased flexibility of the abdominal muscles. It works on the premise that shortened abdominals cause compensatory actions in the back extensor muscles during daily activities. This is also a progressive exercise where the patient must start with step 1 all the way through step 5.



Prone lying or “plank” position: Lie on your stomach with arms by your sides, legs straight and head turned to one side. Maintain this position for 5-10 minutes. (Try not to sleep!)

Prone lying on elbows position: Start with the first position, but instead, raise your upper chest off the floor with the elbows bent, hands touching the floor or mat, parallel to the floor. Relax your lower back and maintain this position for 5-10 minutes, as tolerated.

Prone press ups: Lie on your stomach with your hands near your shoulders, as if getting ready for a regular push up. Slowly, extend your elbows, while raising your shoulders up off the mat, slowly straightening the elbows, keeping the hands touching the floor. Relax your lower back and maintain this position for 15 seconds then slowly lower the shoulders to starting position, maintaining the hands near your shoulders. Repeat this maneuver nine more times.

Progressive extension with pillows: Lie on your stomach and place a pillow under your chest. Progressively add more pillows as you become accustomed to the position over the course of about 3-5 minutes. Maintain the maximum tolerable position for 10 minutes then remove pillows one at time with a few minutes interval between each.

Standing extension: Start in a neutral position, with your feet one shoulder width apart. Place both your hands in the small of your back (somewhere just above your hips) then lean backward slowly until you reach your maximum tolerable position. Hold that position for 15-30 seconds then slowly go back to the neutral position.

Bring a bottle of water and maybe an energy drink and refill it during breaks. Ice is an idea if you know the weather is hot-warm water is not pleasant! Alternatively, ask if your dance school or theatre has a fridge you can keep your spare bottles in. If the answer is yes, name your bottle! Lots of people will take advantage of the fridge.;
, If it's going to be hot, packing a sweatshirt and a coat is unnecessary. If the weather's gonna be so-so, arriving in a vest top and shorts with just a leotard on underneath is plain stupid. Use common sense!

, Put on the air conditioning and open a window if it is too warm, if it's too cold turn up the heating. Don't be afraid to ask whoever owns the studio\dance school if they can change the temperature, most probably they'll agree.

, If you are male and is at the stage where you're lifting girls, exercise your arms and legs. If you are female and is at the stage where you're en pointe, keep your ankles strong.

, Nibbling on a lettuce leaf when everyone else is enjoying steak and chips will not particularly help you. Yes, watch your figure, but cutting out carbs and sweets is not right. On the other hand, if all you eat is chocolate, chips and burgers, something needs to change. Salad or veg is right for every meal (except breakfast, obviously) and balance out the chocolate mousse for pudding with an apple in it. A balanced diet is key.

, On the days you are not at a ballet lesson, build stamina by working through your syllabus each day, doing a set amount of jumps or a set amount of releves. Don't work too hard though, listen to your body.

, Even if it means skipping a ballet lesson or staying home from a party, do it. Rest is way more important than doing a hundred releves each day! If you really want to make it, get around eight hours of sleep each night. Of course, different bodies require different amounts of rest."

, Despite the popular theory, you do not need to work out 3 hours a day to build up your muscles. In fact, working out that much and working out every day will probably keep your muscles from getting stronger. Put together your schedule using the information below.

, All of these sports exercise your cardiac muscles (heart). Having a strong heart is a major component of being fit. Without, you will not be able to do any active activity for very long. A strong heart will allow you do things for a longer period of time. So, practice an endurance sport every other day. A good place to start might be to swim 20 laps, run 2–3 miles (3.2–4.8 km), or bike 3–4 miles (4.8–6.4 km). When it starts to get easier, slowly start adding miles or laps (i.e., adding one more lap every two weeks, running half a mile more every month, etc.,).

, There are many, many exercises that work these muscles, so you can change the workout every couple weeks to keep from getting bored. Do this workout every other day.

, Again, there are a lot of exercises for your lower body, so you can change it every once in a while. Do this workout every other day.

, Therefore, you should be exercising around 30 minutes to one hour a day.

, If you don't write it down, you won't see that you'll improving as easily, and it will be harder to keep going.

, No, you don't have to go all-out and never eat junk food again. The meal before your workouts, eating a little less than normal is good, and eating foods with carbs and Vitamin C can give you energy. The meal after your workouts, eating foods that are high in protein help your muscles recover. But, the most important thing is to drink lots of water. Energy drinks, no matter what the commercials, cannot replace water. Drink water, and lots of it.

, The biggest mistake people who want to get stronger make is working out 2-3 hours a day. They do this because they start out exercising moderately, but they don't see results immediately, and they think that their program is not exercising their muscles enough, so they work out more. You will not see immediate results. You will not become Superman in one night. The change will be gradual. It might be so gradual, in fact, that you might not notice it for a very long time. But you will improve eventually.

, You don't get stronger during the workout. You get stronger during the recovery. So, if you don't recover, you won't get stronger. Simple. If your schedule is correctly set up, you will not be exercising the same muscles on the same days, giving one group of muscles time to rest while working out another group. If your schedule is not set up this way, change it immediately.

, Listen to music while you're working out. Work out with a friend. Challenge yourself! After all, this schedule isn't supposed to be temporary, but permanent. If you're going to be spending a chunk of your life following your exercise schedule, you might as well have fun!

Make yourself more marketable as a fitness model by highlighting what makes you unique. If you keep fit by hiking and skiing, you’ll appeal to outdoor adventurers. If you’re a busy mom who squeezes in workouts in between your job and homework time, you’ll connect with working parents. If you lost 100 pounds by running, you’ll inspire others to take up jogging. Stay true to yourself and you’ll appeal to your audience., As a female fitness model, you need to be in shape. You also may need to share your exercise tips and workout habits with your audience. Develop a routine that you can stick to. If you enjoy exercise, you’re more likely to make it a habit. You might like working out at a gym, using fitness DVDs at home or running outside. If you’re just starting your fitness career, you’ll need time to build up your cardio endurance and strength.Exercise five to seven times a week for 30-60 minutes each day. Do cardiovascular activity such as fast walking, jogging, biking, dancing or aerobics. Also perform weight training activities such as sit-ups, push-ups, lunges, squats and working out with weights.
Meet with a personal trainer to develop an exercise plan that works for you. A personal trainer can help you develop a routine that fits your lifestyle and goals. They’ll also help you perform moves correctly.

, To get fit, you need to eat healthy. Just like with exercise, develop an eating plan that matches your lifestyle and that you enjoy. You’ll be more likely to stick with it. At least 80% of your diet should be comprised of healthy foods such as fruit, vegetables, lean protein and whole grains. You can still enjoy your favorite foods, just keep unhealthy food in moderation. Make sure high-fat and sugary food make up no more than 20% of your diet.Substitute unhealthy ingredients with healthier alternatives. For example, have sparkling water with lemon instead of soda. Use low-fat cheese, whole wheat macaroni and add peas to make a healthy mac and cheese dish. Get creative and have fun with it. Small substitutions lead to big results.

, Stay away from steroids, diet pills and weight loss supplements. They have side effects such as heart damage and insomnia. Temporary weight loss doesn’t last. Get fit the old-fashioned way through diet and exercise. It isn’t glamorous but it works., If you’re lean and petite, you probably won’t be able to model for a bodybuilding magazine. If your build is bulky, you might not become a bikini model. Unlike runway or fashion modeling, fitness modeling is more accepting of different body shapes. However, pay attention to your natural build. Be realistic about what type of body you have. That will help you focus your career goals on the right type of work., Read women’s fitness magazines such as Women’s Health, Oxygen, Self and Shape. You can also follow most of these magazines online or in social media. Be on the look out for contests asking readers to submit photos or workout advice. If you win, you could be featured in a magazine or online., Organizations such as the National Gym Association have competitions for amateurs. Contestants model and pose on stage for judges. Learn the rules for the competition before you apply. Most fitness competitions require you to perform certain poses on stage. You’ll have to increase your workout training schedule for weeks or months to prepare, If you exercise at a gym, you might as well start working there too. Become a certified group instructor or a personal trainer. It’s a good way to start working in your desired field. You never know where it could lead. For example, maybe the gym might feature you on its website or in its brochure. Viola! Your fitness modeling career has begun., Keep a blog. A blog is an online journal. Write about your tips on diet and exercise, what motivates you and how you got into fitness. Share photos of yourself working out and pictures of healthy meals you’ve made. Blog often, at least once a day. Remember that the world will see your blog. You’ll get your name out there, which may lead to paying fitness gigs., Create short exercise videos and post them online. For example, you can create a YouTube channel so you can keep all of your videos in one place. Or you could create a Facebook or Instagram page where you can share inspirational fitness tips.

, Agencies help you find professional modeling work. Models.com is a good place to start your search. Find ones that work with fitness models. Once you find an agency you’re interested in, do your research. See how long it has been in business. Check the company’s record with the Better Business Bureau (BBB). Remember that a reputable agency will never ask you for money. If they’re interested in you, they’ll take you on as a client. You should never have to pay fees. If they ask you for money, it’s a sign that it’s not a reputable agency.Take snapshots of your face and full body shots and send them into the agency. Most agencies accept email or online submissions. Natural shots work best. Wear your favorite workout outfit. Avoid heavy makeup or crazy hairstyles.

, Once you’re signed with an agency, you’ll start building your portfolio. The agency will set you up with a test shoot with a professional photographer. You’ll then have a book of photos to bring with you on auditions.

, Modeling for print, online and TV ads is competitive. Expect many rejections. Keep at it. Eventually if you’re persistent, you’ll land a job. Maybe you’ll be a model in a fitness infomercial. Or maybe your picture will be on a yoga mat package. Eventually, you’ll land your dream job as a female fitness model."

Pay special attention to each client's individual needs.",How to Be a Personal Trainer," Before choosing a certification, think about what sort of work you want to do and where. Some places, including gyms and clubs, will not hire you unless you have a specific certification. When deciding upon a career path, ask yourself these questions:


Do you want to work for a gym, a club, or own your private business?
Do you like working with elderly, adults, or children?
Do you like working with healthy individuals or those who are recovering from an injury?;
, Different types of careers need different types of certifications. Here are some examples of certifications and the sort of work associated with them:American Council on Exercise (ACE) certifications are useful if you want to educate people on fitness and teach them how to eventually perform the exercises on their own.
American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) certifications are useful if you want to work with people who are recovering from illness or an injury and need to improve their strength and mobility.
National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM) certifications are useful if you want work with people who wish to improve their strength and fitness. Clients are usually athletes, both student and professional.
National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) certifications are useful if you want to help people improve their strength and mobility. These people can be healthy individuals or those recovering from an illness or an injury.

, Before you can start meeting the requirements of the certification you chose, you will need to make sure that you can afford it. Preparing for your certification can be very expensive, especially if you are required to attend additional classes and workshops. Fortunately, there are many ways you can fund your certification:


Consider a temporary job. This includes working retail and office type jobs, working at a college, university, or high school, or being self-employed.
Consider asking a gym to help fund or sponsor you, especially if it is a gym you want to work at.If you have to earn a 4-year college degree or a 2-year Associate's degree in order to meet the requirements of the certification, try to get a scholarship or financial aid. There are many websites and organizations that offer scholarships. Your school should also offer scholarships and financial aid as well.

, Once you have decided on a certification, it is important to review the requirements and make sure that you meet them. Some certifications may require additional training, courses, advanced degrees, workshops, and even memberships, while others are less demanding and will be content with just a high-school GED and some training experience.If you do not meet the requirements, you may have to attend additional classes or workshops.


If you are eager to begin working as a personal trainer, consider going for the easiest, least-expensive certification first. This will allow you to get ""your foot in the door."" You can always get another, more prestigious certification later when you have more time, money, and experience.
Be sure you have a certification in CPR and/or AED, as almost all personal trainer certifications require it.

, Once you have chosen your certification, you will need to prepare for the exam so that you can pass it. The exams can be very difficult, and often cost hundreds of dollars; sometimes you have to wait weeks before you can re-take a failed exam. Here are some ways you can prepare:Consider enrolling in a college or university and getting a 2-year Associate's degree or a 4-year Bachelor's degree..
Consider attending some short courses. Sometimes, the organizations that offer the certifications also offer some classes designed to help you prepare for the exam. These courses are tailored to the requirements of the exam, and generally last a few weeks to several months. They can be taken in person or online.
Consider attending some workshops. Like the short courses, workshops are often conducted by the same organizations that provide the certifications and exams.
You can also consider reviewing sample questions and topics, purchasing the appropriate textbooks, studying the course material, and taking practice tests on the internet.

, After you have prepared and studied for your certification, register for the exam and take it in the time allotted. Most exams are between 2-3 hours long, and you have to take them within several months of signing up.


Keep in that some certifications require you take re-certify every couple of years, while others will require you to continue attending courses and workshops.

, Before you can get hired at a gym, club, or therapy center, you will need to build your resume through experience. Even if you choose to create your own business and work independently, it is a good idea to have some experience. Having some experience will reassure clients that you are both competent and knowledgeable, and it will help convince clients to employ you as their personal trainer. Getting initial experience may be difficult, especially if you are just starting out, but fortunately, there are many ways in which you can build it up:


While in college, consider applying for an internship. This internship should be at the sort of place you plan to work at later. If you want to work as a fitness trainer at a gym, consider an internship at a gym. Similarly, if you want to work with patients recovering from injuries, consider an internship at a hospital where you help patients recover their strength and mobility.
Volunteer at a gym, club, or therapy center. You may be doing the work for free, but you will get both invaluable experience and references.
It can even be as simple as helping a friend or family member set and achieve a weight-loss or fitness goal. Personal stories like these are also great for cover letters., Working at a gym or club has both advantages and disadvantages. Evaluate the advantages and the disadvantages and their levels of importance to you. If some of the disadvantages deal with something that is important to you, then working at a company may not be the right choice for you. Here are some advantages and disadvantages of working at a gym or club:


Finding clients will be easier. Some of them might already be assigned to you by your employer, while others will be attending the gym you are working at. You do not have to actively seek out clients.
You also will not have to rent a studio. On the other hand, you will be stuck with whatever equipment is provided. You also will be stuck with the building, so if it lacks air conditioning, there is little you can do to change that.
Another disadvantage is that you will have less flexibility when it comes to choosing your work schedule.
Lastly, you will have little choice when it comes to choosing your salary and the insurance provided to you.

, Working privately also has its advantages and disadvantages. You will have more control over what hours you work, where you work, how much you get paid, and what insurance you get. Unfortunately, you will also have to put in more effort when it comes to finding clients. Evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of working for yourself, and decide whether or not the time, money, and effort is something you are willing to sacrifice for the benefits.


One advantage to working for yourself is that you will have control over your salary and what insurance you use.
Another advantage is that you will have control over what days and hours you work. Keep in mind, however, that the hours you work will also determine how many clients you get. Most people work during the day, so scheduling yourself during the day may not get you many clients. Consider scheduling yourself in the mornings before people go to work, and the evenings after people leave work.
You will also have more control over where you work and what equipment you use. Unfortunately, if you are renting a private studio, you will have to pay the rent and buy the equipment (but you can also add that much-desired air conditioning). If you are working at a client's house, you won't have to pay rent or buy equipment. You can, however, advise your client what to buy.
Finding clients will be difficult. You will have to learn how to market yourself well, and actively seek out your clients.

, Whether you are working for a corporation at a gym or a club, or for yourself, you want to be insured. Insurance will cover you financially if you injure yourself and cannot work for a few days, weeks, or months. It will also protect you if your client gents injured.If you are working at a gym or club, you may already be covered by the company's insurance plan. It is a good idea, however, to review the insurance plan so that you know what and for how much the plan is covering you for.
If you are self-employed, you will need to purchase some sort of an insurance plan. You may also want to consider General Liability insurance. Under a General Liability insurance, you will be protected in the event a client is injured in your studio, but you will not be held responsible if a client gets injured on his or her property during a training session., This does not necessarily mean that you should abandon everything else and focus solely on your specialization. While it is important to know various aspects of physical fitness and training, it is also a good idea to specialize on a particular form of exercise or equipment.Doing so will allow you to become an expert in this area, and might even make you more sought-after by interested clients.


For example, you can focus on training just the upper body, specifically on the abdominal muscles.
You can also focus on one particular piece of equipment, such as dumbbells, and incorporate them into your exercises.

, The blog does not have to be a bunch of ""Choose Me as Your Personal Trainer!"" advertisements. Instead, consider using your blog as a workout journal where you record your daily or weekly workout routines followed by the results. People will read your blog and follow your progress. They may consider contacting you to help them workout plan for themselves. They may even refer to you one of their friends!

, Much like blogs, social media can help others discover your business and learn more about it. Create an account on various social media websites and post daily or weekly updates on your workout regime followed by the results. You can also consider posting your clients' progress as well, but be sure to ask your clients first if they are comfortable with this.

, If you do not know how to code a website, you can either create one using a program or hire someone else to do it for you. Use this website to discuss yourself, your work, and your clients' success. Consider including the following sections:


A biography where you discuss yourself, your background, and your goals.
A section where clients can post their success their stories. Seeing others meet their goals will convince potential clients that you know what you are doing and that you can help them.
A question and answer section where you answer fitness-related questions on a weekly, monthly, etc basis. This will show others how knowledgeable you are. They will both trust and respect you.

, Optimizing your website for search engines can help people find your site sooner. This is important, because most people do not click past the first page of search results. The higher up your website is on the search results, the more likely someone will see it, click on it, and find your business.

, When you are up and about running errands, don't be afraid to strike up conversations with others. Do not blatantly advertise yourself and ask people to consider you as their personal trainer; instead, let the conversation take a more natural course. For example:


If you meet someone at the bar, consider asking the person about his or her job. This may lead him or her asking you about your job. They might become interested in becoming a client, and if they aren't, they might know someone who might want a personal trainer.

, A great place to advertise your business is on the internet. There are many websites that are specifically designed for such advertisements. Another option is to frequent fitness-related forums and advertise there.


If you join a website or forum, be sure to read the rules. Some have guidelines regarding where and how you post your advertisements. The last thing you would want is to get banned!

, Many newspapers and magazines not only have a section for advertisements, but are available both on the internet and in paper format. This means that twice as many people will see your advertisement. Consider sending your advertisement to your local newspaper or fitness magazine.

, There are many public places that allow people to post fliers for their businesses. Consider designing a few fliers on your computer, printing them, and then posting them in public locations, such as libraries, cafes, and community centers. Be sure to ask for permission before posting any fliers.


When designing your flier, consider including your contact information on little slips of paper that interested clients can then tear off and take home. This will help customers who do not have a pen and paper to copy down your contact information. It will allow allow potential clients to take several copies to distribute to others who might also be interested.

, There are many places to find clients, both on the internet and off the internet, and it is important to frequent those places.


If you wish to find clients on the internet, consider joining websites related to fitness, weight-loss, and physical therapy. These sorts of websites are frequented not just by fellow trainers and their clients, but also people seeking trainers.
If you wish to find clients off the internet, consider frequenting gyms, community centers, and parks. Some people might try to join a gym seeking to improve their strength and overall health, but they may not know where to begin. If you see someone looking lost, uncertain, in-confident, or desperate, approach them and converse with them. They may decide to chose you as their personal trainer.

, Simply posting an advertisement at a community center or on a website will not be enough; over time, your advertisement may get taken down, lost, or buried beneath other advertisements. It is important to revisit the places you distributed your advertisements and update them with new ones. It is also important to continue updating your website, blog, and/or social media account.

, Even if the organization that certified you doesn't require continuing education, you should still keep up-to-date on the latest developments in the field of sports science. Not only does this introduce you to new techniques that may benefit your clients, it also means you're more likely to be able to answer your clients' questions, whether they come from honest curiosity or an urge to stump the trainer.

, The more, diverse experiences you have in the fitness field, the longer your list of qualifications gets and the better you'll be able to connect with like-minded clients. Here are some examples of specialties that you can explore:


Various types of yoga
CrossFit
Zumba
Boot camp workouts

, Clients are much more likely to trust a trainer that follows his or her own advice and has the results to prove it. The more practice you have under your belt, the more chances you have to see first-hand what works and what doesn't. In other words, practice what you preach.

, Word-of-mouth advertising from satisfied clients will help you get more clients. Contact local gyms to inquire about training in their facility. Local rehabilitation clinics are another potential source of clients and referrals. Often, clients who have finished with physical therapy still need guidance and encouragement to stay active, healthy and complete a full recovery. Ask clients to refer friends, distribute fliers to local weight-loss groups and put brochures up on public bulletin boards.

, Some need careful, constant supervision, while others may want to be educated so they can become self-sufficient exercisers themselves. Make it standard policy to have a goal-setting session with each new client to make sure you're both working toward the same ultimate goal. This will not only help you connect better with your clients, but it will also help you get more referrals from satisfied clients.

Understand that variety is beautiful.,
Know your biological background information.,
Understand human instinct.,
Be your own best friend.,
Be proud of your round bottom!,
Take care of yourself.,
Make yourself feel sexy!",How to Be Curvy and Proud," Human beings come in all shapes and sizes. All of them are equally beautiful. The fact that only certain body types are featured on billboards and magazines is because the magazine editors can make more money that way. The reason clothing designers want skinny models is because they don't have to spend as much money on the cloth to make a new dress. It's all about money. Don't sell yourself short on account of greedy people.;
, Women develop curves in puberty. Only a certain amount of body fat enables your body to produce sex hormones while you grow into a woman. These hormones make you fertile. Overly skinny girls and women either never begin having their period (and that means they are unable to have children) or their period stops if they under-nourish their body. This is very dangerous and very sad, because the physical damage, once done, is permanent.

, Heterosexual men are attracted to women because of their curvy bodies. Curves equal estrogen, which is the female sex hormone. Subconsciously, men are drawn to women who are their ideal partners to reproduce, even if they don't consciously want to have children with that woman.

, Look at yourself in the mirror without clothes. Don't look at yourself like you are your own worst enemy. Pretend that you are standing next to yourself as your best friend. Find the aspects of your body that you like. Flaunt them by wearing clothes and accessories that draw attention to the body parts you are proud of.

, A lot more people are attracted to nice round butts than you would believe. You might think it's too big or sticks out too far, while the people behind you on the stairs or on the street might think you're so hot! Some girls with more boyish figures are envying YOU, you shouldn't envy them.

, Love yourself and treat your body well.

Eat healthily, this will make feel better on the inside and outside!






Exercise. Every little bit helps. Walk more, do star jumps before you go bed and when you wake up, or even go on the Wii! You don't need the gym if you don't have a lot of money. Loads of things are for free! Lift weights for 30 minutes a week. You can lift anything, two big soup cans, a gallon of milk, anything. There are many good exercises on the Internet. A very good beginner's workout is Dr. Oz's 20-minute workout. Google it. The exercises can be done by anyone. The more often you do it, the easier it becomes.







, Give yourself a day where you can do the little things to make you feel stunning, like doing your eyebrows, painting your nails and shopping for that nice body of yours! Use lotion to develop a better relationship to your body. Touch your skin while you apply the lotion and nurture yourself. You deserve to feel good.

Enlist the help of professionals.,
Follow the USDA guidelines for a balanced diet.,
Eat several small meals throughout the day.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Eat your recommended daily caloric intake according to the USDA.,
Create a stimulating exercise plan.,
Work out at a time that is right for you.,
Plan a balanced diet and exercise based on your overall goals.",How to Balance Diet and Exercise," A nutritionist can design a diet plan that meets your health needs. A personal trainer will keep you motivated and help you exercise all parts of your body.


A nutritionist will consider any pre-existing health conditions, your age and weight when designing a diet plan for you. He can also teach you what foods to avoid and how to limit sugar, fat and cholesterol.
Personal trainers are available at most public gyms and can design a regular exercise program that includes equal amounts of cardiovascular and aerobic exercise. A trainer will also provide encouragement and help you avoid cheating or shortening workouts.;
,


While your specific dietary needs may vary, the USDA Food Pyramid is the best guide for consuming the recommended daily amounts of whole grains, proteins, dairy, fruit and vegetables. Create your diet around these guidelines and try to consume at least the minimum number of daily servings. It's important to reduce calories in small, gradual amounts in several areas of your diet instead of cutting one food group out completely. This gradual change will keep your metabolism active and keep your energy level up for daily exercise.

, Also, schedule meals before and after a workout.


Eating 5 or 6 small meals through the day instead of a few large ones will keep your metabolism stimulated throughout the day and help you lose weight. A meal high in carbohydrates just before a workout will give you energy when you exercise, while foods high in protein will help rejuvenate you afterward.

,


Consume at least 8 glasses of water a day, including at least 1 after a workout. Water keeps you hydrated, boosts metabolism and encourages cell production.

, This will vary according to your height, weight, and age. High blood sugar or cholesterol will also factor in this number. Keep this calorie limit in mind when planning portions for meals.

,


Design a plan that you will enjoy and be able to follow. Your exercise regimen should push you to work hard without being dangerous. Alternate different activities like running, swimming and weightlifting to avoid getting bored.
Create an exercise plan and a diet plan that are both gradual, not drastic lifestyle changes. Do a few short workouts during the day instead of 1 long session to ease your body into regular exercise. Your shorter periods of exercise will balance your small meals throughout the day so you are energized without feeling heavy or bloated.

,


Stimulating your body with a workout in the morning will keep your metabolism higher all day. If you're not a morning workout person, try scheduling exercise after work to unwind after your day. Finish daily exercise at least 2 hours before you plan to go to bed to allow your body to relax and prepare to rest.

, Adjust the balance to fit weight loss or muscle gain.


Include lots of cardiovascular exercise like running or aerobics if you're trying to lose weight. Balance this exercise regimen with a diet low in carbohydrates and sugar to encourage your body to break down excess fat instead of storing it.
Focus on weight training and resistance exercises if you're at your ideal weight but want to gain muscle and become more fit. Boost your weightlifting workout by eating a diet high in protein and carbohydrates to give your body energy for endurance.

Replace fluids lost from sweat.,
Maintain your muscles' energy source.,
Consume some running gel.,
Use your emotions to enhance your performance.,
Smile and laugh.,
Become absorbed in the game.",How to Be Energetic when You Are Playing a Sport1," During a game you will continually to need to drink fluids to replace what you have lost in sweat. If the game, sport, or competition will last for more than 1 hour, drink ½-1 cup of sports drink every 15-20 minutes.Drinks like Gatorade, Powerade, Isostar, or Lucozade Sport to replace lost sodium and electrolytes, which should help you to keep up your energy levels.Be sure to drink in small but frequent amounts so that you don't accidentally make yourself sick., It is possible that you might run into a situation where you're playing two games back to back, say in a tournament, and you'll find yourself unable to take the time to go eat a full meal--or maybe you just end up hungry during a regular game. In these cases, you will need to replenish your energy periodically during and between games with small, healthy snacks. You will want to pick a healthy food, like a banana, a handful of nuts, or a seed-based bar for example, that can fuel you for 6 to 8 hours ideally.Try using your practices to experiment to find out which foods satisfy your energy needs best.
Make sure you don't choose foods that upset your stomach or cause you discomfort.
Be sure to eat small amounts of food often, say during your time spent on the bench or if your coach calls for a huddle, and bring multiple options to pick and choose from.

, People who participate in marathons or long-distance sports may find their energy flagging over time but without the ability to stop. For endurance athletes who need to replenish energy they've already used, invest in and eat some special gel made of concentrated carbs to get that quick fuel that you need to keep going.It's generally recommended to start taking the gels early on, within the first 45 to 60 minutes of your race, but not to use them as a substitute for a good breakfast.Continue consuming the gels at a rate of 45 to 60 minutes per packet. Those with sensitive stomachs will want to make the time between snacks longer to avoid any potential stomach problems.If you have stomach issues, try to consume the gels at a rate of ¼ a packet every 20 minutes to make the digestive process easier on your stomach.
Be careful; when you eat these gels, you will need to take them with water, and never with a sports drink.GU, Huma, Honey Stinger, and Clif are just a few of many brands that produce gel shots you can take. Try looking for them at Walmart, on Amazon, or any sporting goods store.
Be sure to only use these for long distance running; even runners participating in 5k events do not need these products. , It is natural to become invested in the competition aspect of the game. This can make it hard to take losses well, but losing your cool could result in you losing your focus and potentially making mistakes. Instead of shouting and stomping and getting thrown out of the game, return to your position even more determined to win.


Focus only on what is your job and what you can control--what's already happened is done.
Remember to play within the scope of your game's rules: you don't want to be thrown out because of unsportsmanlike behavior such as elbowing someone in the face.

, If you're feeling down, anxious, or angry during the game and you are unable to refocus it into a positive spin, you should smile or laugh to shake the negative effects off. These actions stimulate chemicals that make us feel good, fight off stress, and act as anti-depressants.You will find it helps to elevate your mood, which will in turn improve your performance.


Try thinking back to a good memory, maybe a time you had fun with your friends, or some goal you recently achieved in your sport.
Try thinking of a joke that made you laugh, or asking someone to tell you one.
Tell someone else a joke--laughter and happiness are infectious, and if you can make them laugh, chances are you will at least smile if not laugh yourself., If you really want to reach your peak performance, you'll need to set aside all thoughts about other things. Forget about your worries about tests or that fight you had with your girlfriend/boyfriend. Ignore the crowd, the jeering from the other team or their fans, even distractions from other sources like loudspeakers or planes overhead. Concentrate only on the task that you have to do, and feel confident that you can do it, so that all of your energy and all of you is focused solely on the game.


This is all part of what many athletes commonly refer to as ""getting in 'the zone.'"" If you can get into the zone, your negative thoughts and worries will all fall away and you will become more self-confident."

Unfortunately, you cannot get everything you need from just one food, or even one food group.Current recommendations say that about half the food you eat should be fruits and vegetables and more grains than protein.The amount of calories you should take in per day varies by age, gender, and lifestyle.Don't skip meals, particularly on a game day. You get calories from the food you consume, which is then turned into energy for your muscles to burn. If you don't eat enough while exercising, you can suffer from exhaustion and hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar.While prepackaged sports foods like granola or protein bars are convenient, the best foods for you to eat are going to be unprocessed foods, either raw (when possible) or home cooked.5-6 hours before your game, eat a larger meal, ideally one high in complex carbohydrates.Try corn, rice, wheat bagels or other starchy foods, which are known for being good sources of complex carbs.Have a light and healthy snack like peanut butter or yoghurt before you play., The human body is roughly 60% water and needs it for a lot of different things, including cooling off.If your body starts to run low on water, you become ""dehydrated."" People who become severely dehydrated may suffer dizziness, fever, headache, delirium, and even pass out.The amount of water you need to drink on a daily basis depends on your age. 5 to 8 year olds need 5 glasses or 1 liter of water a day. 9 to 12 year olds should get 7 glasses or 1.5 liters a day. Teenagers should aim for 8 to 10 glasses, or 2 liters.Adults should have between 2.2 and 3 liters everyday.In hot and humid weather and before and during exercise, you will need to drink even more water than usual.When not exercising, you should almost always choose water above any other drink. Although some drinks like fruit juice or sports drinks do have good things in them, like vitamins or electrolytes, they're also loaded with sugar and calories.You can tell how your hydration is by looking at your pee: if it comes out dark yellow or amber, you're not drinking enough; if it is clear or pale in color then you're in good shape., Sleep helps to keep you healthy, strengthens your immune system, speeds up recovery from injury, and promotes growth.This includes muscle repair and growth, which is exactly what athletes need to perform better.Without proper rest, you may find yourself feeling sleepy, slow, and unalert while trying to play.


How much sleep you need depends on your age. Kids 6-12 years of age need 9-12 hours and teens from 13-18 years old need 8-10 hours.Adults need 7-9 hours of sleep every night.Keep to a set schedule even on the weekends to reinforce your body's natural sleep-wake cycle and promote better, deeper sleep at night.It can be especially challenging if you're very excited or nervous to sleep well. Try distracting yourself from your nervous thoughts by reading a book, telling yourself a story, writing in a journal to exorcise the thoughts, or listening to calming music. If you still can't sleep, try taking a short walk or a hot shower before trying to sleep again.
Avoid electronic devices which emit light, like smart phones, TVs, computers, and tablets. The light these items put off makes it harder for you to sleep, which may result in fatigue the next day., Before you step foot on the court, pitcher's mound, or even just plain exercise, be sure to adequately warm yourself up. A good warm up should last between 15 and 30 minutes and not begin too far in advance. It should get your heart rate up, stretch your muscles to increase your range of motion in your joints, and incorporate drills and exercises specific to your sport to prepare you for the game's demands. Start by getting your pulse up first, follow that by stretching, and end it with your drills, like dribbling, passing, or serving.You can ask your coach for help with determining a good warm up routine, including the proper sport specific drills are most beneficial to you.

, Nobody is born knowing how to dribble a basketball, hit a homerun, or stop a quarterback sneak. After you have learned to do something, you then need to develop a muscle memory for it. Muscle memory is when a specific movement is repeated often enough over time so as to make it performed without conscious effort.As you improve you will find your self-confidence, enthusiasm, and energy for the game increasing as well.
Ideally, you should at least attend as many of the official practices with your team as possible. This helps build your relationship with your team and your coach so you can all perform better as a whole.
When possible, practice with family and friends on days that you're not officially practicing with your team. The more practice you have before the game day, the better.

"
"
Think and talk positively.,
Visualize your goals.,
Listen to empowering music.,
Practice good daily habits.",How to Be Energetic when You Are Playing a Sport3," Going in with a good attitude about how the game is going to turn out and how you can perform will help you to build enthusiasm and self-confidence. In fact, successful athletes possess a multitude of mental skills, including maintaining a positive attitude and using positive self-talk.Try not to focus on the negatives or failures but to reflect on the positives.


Make a list of your best skills and all the things you've improved on in the last weeks, months, or even years. Write these things down, and use them to give yourself a pep talk. ""I am the best at blocking on my team, and I've really improved on my free-throws. I know I can do this!""
Talk to yourself like you were talking to your best friend: would you blame them for missing a catch, or would you encourage them to believe that they can get it next time?
When you find yourself feeling down, use positive self talk to pull your mood up. ""Hey, I know that I messed up back there, but I tried my best, and I learned something new. I'm going to practice all this week, and I'll do better next time!""
If you need a bigger pep-talk going into the game, talk to your friends, coach, or even your parents. Ask them what areas they think you do well in, where you can improve, and ask for their help.

, Before it's time to go out and play, get your mind in the zone by closing your eyes and picturing yourself doing well, whether you're dribbling the ball, passing the puck, or running across home base. Studies have found that even as little as five minutes of mental visualizations boost performance significantly, even for novices and amateurs. What happens is because you ""see"" yourself performing perfectly, your brain creates a neural pattern for your muscles to follow.You will want to incorporate all of your senses--sight, sound, touch, smell, and taste--into the fantasy and make it as detailed as possible, right down to picturing the crowds, the weather, and the feel of the ball in your hands.Just like practicing your actual moves, you will need to practice your visualization techniques in order to make it easier for yourself.
Make sure your mental images are realistic. Not even Michael Jordan could dunk a basketball from 300 feet away; don't set goals for yourself that you can't reach.

, A lot of athletes like to listen to songs with a fast beat and uplifting or empowering lyrics before starting a game. It's easy to channel nervous energy into positive excitement when you have messages telling you that you can do it to sing or hum along to. Try building your own playlist to listen to on an MP3 player or use free services like Youtube or Bandcamp on your phone or a tablet right before you're due to start.

, Although we often think of babies throwing fits because they're tired, hungry, or thirsty, older kids, teenagers, and even grown adults are just as susceptible to mood fluctuations due to certain imbalances. The same activities--eating, sleeping, and drinking correctly--that keep our bodies healthy also help to support a healthy mind. While some strong emotions like disappointment, excitement, and anger are an expected part of playing, you can help to make sure they are within a healthy range by maintaining good practices up to and during your games.


Scientific evidence supports the concept of people becoming ""hangry"" if they haven't eaten enough.Sleep deprived people can easily become more stressed, angry, sad, and mentally exhausted.Mild dehydration causes anger and mood swings."

Keep your weight under control.,
Warm up before exercise.,
Cool down after working out.,
Stretch to increase flexibility.,
Perform aerobic exercises to control weight and build muscle in order to protect your knees.,
Avoid high-impact exercises or ones that put stress on your knees.,
Take precautions if you run frequently.,
Strengthen the muscles around your knee.,
Strengthen your core.",How to Avoid Knee Injuries1," Every pound of excess weight puts about 5 pounds of extra pressure on your knees when you go up and down stairs, so losing excess weight is hugely important for protecting your knees.Studies have shown that people with arthritic knees lose 20 percent of their pain with every 10 pounds of weight loss., A warm up prepares your body for physical activity, thereby both reducing the chance of injury and improving performance. Generally speaking, the less frequently you exercise, the longer you will need to warm up.Some good warm ups include:



Starting slow — If you are doing an aerobic activity like walking, swimming, or biking, start slowly for five to 10 minutes, then gradually ramp up to full speed.Step-ups — Step up onto a small stool or stairs, lifting your body with one leg. Step back down with the same leg. Do 10–15 step-ups per leg.

Hamstring curls — Lie flat on your stomach and bend one leg so your heel moves towards your buttocks. Repeat 10–15 times per leg.

Straight-leg lifts — Lie on your back with one leg bent so your foot is flat on the floor. Keeping your other leg straight, lift it until it is perpendicular to your body. Repeat 10–15 times for each leg.

, Cool down by gradually decreasing the intensity level of your aerobic exercise. Slow down until your breathing and heart rate have returned to normal. Cooling down helps your body to recover and reduces the risk of strains and injury.Light cardio — Walk for five to 10 minutes until your heart rate slows, or bike or row at low resistance for five to 10 minutes. If swimming, swim leisurely for five to 10 minutes.Walking lunges — Do two sets of ten walking lunges. As you step forward, transfer your weight to your front leg and bend both legs until the knee of your back leg is only an inch off the floor. Push off with both legs to step forward onto your other foot and repeat the process.Stretching — Follow your light cardio or lunges with five to 10 minutes of stretching., Increased flexibility in your calves, hamstrings, quadriceps and hips will reduce the chance of knee injury by helping you to move more fluidly and with better posture.Stretching should be done both after warming up and after exercising. To keep your heart rate elevated after your warm up, do standing stretches. Save sitting stretches for after your cool down.Stretch slowly, hold each stretch for at least 30 seconds, and do not bounce while stretching, as this may cause injury. Some good stretches include:Quadriceps (Standing) – While holding onto a support for balance, grab the top of your left foot with your right hand and slowly pull your heel towards your buttocks. Repeat with the other leg.

Calf (Standing) — Stand with one leg before the other. Lean forward while holding onto a solid support, putting your weight on your front leg and keeping your back leg straight and the heel on the ground in order to stretch the calf. Repeat with the other leg.

Hamstring (Standing) — Standing with your legs spread just beyond shoulder width, lean forward and towards one leg while keeping your legs and back straight. Repeat with the other leg.

Standing hip flexor (Standing) — Stand with one foot a bit in front of the other and, keeping your back straight, lunge forward on your front leg until you feel some strain, but no discomfort in the front of the hip of your back leg. Repeat with the other leg.

Butterfly stretch (Sitting) — Sit up straight with the soles of your feet pressed together and hold your feet as you lean your upper body forward. Lean until you feel some strain, but no discomfort.

Hamstring (Sitting) — Sit and straighten one leg, while keeping the other bend so that the sole of your foot rests against the thigh of the opposite leg. Lean forward towards your outstretched leg while being sure to keep your foot upright. Repeat with the other leg.

, Focus on the following non-impact exercises that will keep you in shape without stressing your knees:Walking on level ground
Elliptical training
Stationary or road biking
Swimming
Water aerobics

, Running on hard surfaces like concrete or asphalt, and particularly downhill running, can be hard on the knees. Likewise, strength exercises including deep knee bends and squats can strain the knees. If doing them, never bend your knee more than halfway., Warm up in advance and run on a smooth soft surface such as a track or dirt trail instead of cement or asphalt. Walk down hills instead of running. Reduce stride length to lessen the impact on your knees.Be sure to purchase new shoes every 400 to 600 miles traveled to ensure the soles do not get too compressed to properly absorb impact., Focus on your hips, quadriceps, and hamstrings, performing 1-3 sets of 8-10 repetitions for each muscle group. The type of exercise is not important so long as you exercise the muscles regularly. Some exercises to consider include:Weight machines — Weights are a good way to isolate particular muscles. Do hamstring curls, legs extensions, and hip abduction/adduction exercises.

Lunges — Lunges exercise the hips, quads, and hamstrings (as well as your glutes and calves) in one exercise. Stand straight, then step forward. As your foot lands, bend both legs until your back knee is about an inch from the floor. Both knees should be at about a 90 degree angle. Push off with your legs and move forward as you return to a standing position. Be sure to keep your body upright during the exercise.Squats — With your feet shoulder-length or slightly wider apart, squat down while keeping your back as straight as possible and being careful to sit back rather than lean forward. Continue squatting until your thighs are parallel to the ground. Return to standing., Slouching while you walk throws your body off balance and will eventually lead to knee pain. To be sure you stand up straight when you move, you need to do exercises to strengthen your core (i.e. your abs, lower back, and surrounding muscles):Planks — Lie face down with your toes on the floor. Keep your back straight as you raise yourself off the ground, resting on your toes and forearms, which you should place on the floor with your elbows at 90-degree angles. Hold for 15–45 seconds.

Back extensions — Lie face down with your elbows bent so that your hands are flat on the floor. Keeping your hips pressed into the floor, arch your back and press with your arms so your head and shoulders are off the floor. Hold for five to 10 seconds and repeat five to 10 times.

Get shoes that are comfortable and have plenty of cushioning.,
Replace your shoes regularly.,
Wear knee braces to reduce the risk of injury during sports or while performing dangerous activities.",How to Avoid Knee Injuries2," Shoe store salespeople will talk to you about ankle pronation, impact pattern, and plantar shape — i.e. the imprint of the bottom of your foot — but recent studies indicate that to prevent injury, you are best off simply picking a shoe that you find comfortable. It turns out that people are very good at intuitively picking shoes that will work best for their style of movement.One exception to the “pick shoes by comfort"" rule is if you have flat feet. In this case, you will probably need special shoe inserts and arch supports.Save high heels for special occasions. Wearing them too frequently can lead to chronic knee pain., Particularly if you run or walk a lot, it is important to replace your shoes before the soles get too compressed. If you begin to experience sore arches, shin pain, or achy knees, then it’s time to replace your shoes. It’s better, however, to replace them before pain appears.Keep a log of how far you walk or run each day. Replace your shoes when you have covered between 400 and 600 miles.
The specific distance will depend on your weight and running style. Heavier runners and runners with longer strides will need to replace their shoes sooner.If the bottom of your shoes becomes worn down and smooth, replace them.

, Braces provide added support to the knee ligaments. Particularly if you are playing a collision sport (football, lacrosse, hockey, rugby), knee braces have been shown to reduce the risk of knee injury.Players of contact sports (basketball, soccer) and sports that requires rapid changes of direction (tennis) may also benefit, as many people engaged in activities that pose a significant risk of knee injury, such as skiing. Talk to your regular doctor, a sports medicine doctor, or an orthopedist about the right brace for you.



Prophylactic — For athletes in contact sports. These braces, designed to protect ligaments, attach above and below the knee, with one or two hinged metal bars connecting the sides of the brace.Functional — For athletes in contact sports. These braces protect knee ligaments in a fashion similar to prophylactic braces, with a metal “shell” that is hinged on both sides of the knee.Patellofemoral (sleeve) — For people suffering from knee pain or athletes looking for some knee stabilization. A brace made of elastic material – usually neoprene – that is designed to hold the patella in the proper position and thus reduce chronic knee pain. These braces offer some knee stabilization, but will do little to prevent ligament damage."
"
Perform a warm up routine including neuromuscular training.,
Learn proper form for your sport.,
Consider wearing a brace when playing collision sports.",How to Avoid Knee Injuries3," The PEP (Prevent Injury, Enhance Performance) and FIFA 11+ programs are free, 20-30 minute warm up routines that have been shown to decrease the incidence of serious knee injuries by 50% if used regularly.They focus on proper techniques for changing direction, jumping and landing. If you are a player, talk to your coach about adopting one of these programs, or try arriving early to warm up on your own.


Prevent Injury, Enhance Performance (PEP) — A 15-20 minute program performed 3 times a week, and consisting of a warm-up, stretching, strengthening, plyometrics (jump training), and sport specific agility drills. PEP was developed by the Santa Monica Sports Medicine Research Foundation, and the exercise details can be found on their website.
FIFA 11+ — A 20 minute program performed at least 2 times a week, and consisting of running exercises, strengthening, plyometrics (jump training), and balance exercises. Designed by sports scientists in conjunction with FIFA, it has been shown to reduce the number of injured players by 30-50%. Find the full program here.

, This might mean learning how to keep your pads low and hands out to protect your knees as an American football player, or how to tackle properly as a soccer player. Proper form will both make you a more efficient player and reduce the risk of injury to you and others.

, All sports that involve jumping and sudden change of direction pose a risk to your knees, but collision sports pose the added risk of injury through contact. Consider wearing a knee brace if playing American football, rugby, hockey, or lacrosse."

Hydrate.,
Wear loose, light clothing.,
Avoid alcohol, caffeine, and sugar.,
Acclimate yourself to a new environment.,
Talk to your doctor about exercise if you're over 65.,
Know the effects of your medications.,
Protect yourself from the sun.",How to Avoid Heat Stress While Exercising1," Drinking plenty of fluids will help your body sweat and maintain a normal body temperature. Water is your best choice for less-intense workouts, but if you're engaged in a long exercise session add a sports drink to replace the salt that's lost when you sweat. You should drink about 8 ounces of fluid every 20 minutes.Make sure the water or sports drinks are cool, but not too cold. Having very cold drinks after exerting yourself might cause stomach cramps.Choose lower-calorie sports drinks, which have less sugar.
If your doctor has told you to limit fluids because of a health condition, be sure to check with them about how much extra you need to drink when the temperature rises.;
, Your workout clothes should be loose-fitting, lightweight, light-colored, and made of material designed to allow sweat to evaporate from your skin. If your clothes become sweat-soaked, change into dry clothes. Wet clothes interfere with your body's ability to cool itself, and can cause heat rash. Dark and tight clothes hold in heat and prevent you from cooling off naturally., Alcohol use can affect your body's ability to regulate your temperature, and drinking alcohol can cause you to be dehydrated the following day. Caffeinated and high-sugar drinks like soda cause you to lose fluids. Avoid these the day you work out and use sparingly the day before.Do not take salt tablets, which can increase your risk of dehydration., If you are beginning an outdoor exercise program, traveling somewhere hot and more humid, or the temperature suddenly rises in your area, slowly work up to your usual schedule so your body can get used to the heat. If you're on vacation, you probably don't have several weeks to wait, but limit the intensity and duration of your workouts and take more frequent rest and water breaks.


It takes trained athletes about two weeks of training in hot temperatures for their bodies to learn how to adjust to the demands of hot weather. For an untrained individual, or in highly humid weather, this may take as long as two to three months., Anyone can develop heat stress, but children younger than 4 and adults older than 65 are at higher risk. Older adults should discuss any health issues or medications with your doctor prior to starting an exercise plan.


Parents should be alert for signs of heat stress in little ones running around outside on a hot day, as the body's ability to regulate its temperature isn't fully developed in the young., There are some frequently prescribed medications that alter your body's ability to respond to heat stress.The safest way to know is to ask your doctor about your medications' side effects, especially when starting a new workout routine. If a medication you are prescribed does make you more susceptible to heat stress, your doctor can change your medication or instruct you on what measures to take to stay safe while exercising. Some of the most common culprits are:


Beta blockers, like Propranolol
Diuretics, like Hydrochlorothiazide or Furosemide
Antihistamines, like Zyrtec and other common allergy medications
Tranquilizers, like Xanax
Antipsychotics, like Haldol or Clozapine

, If you're going to be outdoors, wear a wide-brimmed hat or find a shady spot for your workout. Apply sunscreen of at least SPF 30 to any exposed skin. Having a sunburn reduces your body's ability to rid itself of heat."
"
Exercise indoors or in the mornings or late afternoons.,
Include rest breaks.,
Take longer, slower runs in extreme heat.,
Exercise at your fitness level.,
Don’t do a hard workout if you’re sick.",How to Avoid Heat Stress While Exercising2," Avoid outdoors workouts during the hottest part of the day. If you can't alter your schedule, reduce the intensity and duration of your workout or find an indoor location for exercise. Work out at the gym, walk laps inside the mall or climb stairs inside an air-conditioned building.


Above 82˚F (27.8˚C) is considered high risk for heat stress., Take breaks often and use that time to rehydrate. Your body loses water through sweat at a rate that isn't matched by thirst, so hydrate at regular intervals of about every 20 minutes even if you don’t feel thirsty.Split a 6 mile run into two 3 mile sections with a rest in between., Your risk for heat stress as a runner is highest during medium-length, high-intensity runs, like a five-mile race at a fast pace. Something longer and slower, like a long run or a marathon, is safer in high heat.This general rule can be used for almost any exercise. In hot weather it's safer to do longer, gentler workouts with water breaks than short, high-intensity workouts.

, Anyone can get heat stroke, whether you're a triathlete or a complete beginner, but overexerting yourself increases your chances of heat illness. You may have a low tolerance to heat if you're overweight, have low stamina, or just haven't exercised in a while. Change the intensity of your exercise routine if you become unable to catch your breath, injure yourself during your workouts, or feel weak or dizzy afterwards.Obesity can affect your body's ability to regulate its temperature and cause your body to retain more heat., If you have a mild cold, there’s no harm in doing a short easy run, but if you feel really unwell avoid high-intensity exercise or long road races.Working out while sick can keep you sick longer, and your body is less able to regulate its temperature when you’re ill.

Rest and rehydrate if you start cramping.,
Hit the showers if you overdo it.,
Use cold packs if you show signs of heat exhaustion.,
Get help if you don’t feel better in an hour.,
Seek emergency treatment if you can’t breathe, feel confused, or have hot dry skin.",How to Avoid Heat Stress While Exercising3," Heat cramps are the mildest form of heat-related illness. Heat cramps are painful muscle contractions, usually occurring in the legs or stomach.Affected muscles might feel hard or tense to the touch. Other symptoms of heat cramps can include heavy sweating, fatigue, and thirst. Quick treatment can often prevent heat cramps from worsening into heat exhaustion, so stop activity, rest in a cool place, remove any damp or unnecessary clothing, and drink cool fluids.Your body temperature may be normal at this stage of heat stress., If you take a break and still feel weak or overly fatigued, it's time to quit for the day. Go home or head to the gym locker room to take a cold shower or soak in a cool bath.Surrounding yourself in cool water will help you lower your body temperature more quickly than just resting.

, Heat exhaustion may develop suddenly or over time, especially with prolonged periods of exercise. Heat exhaustion might be coming on if you experience faintness, weakness, dizziness or lightheadedness, fainting, nausea or vomiting, blurred vision, headache, a weak and rapid pulse or an increased heart rate that seems too high for your level of exertion.Stop exercising immediately and try to lower your body temperature quickly by placing ice packs on your forehead and under your armpits.At this stage of heat stress you may experience excessive sweating, cool moist skin with goose bumps even when in the heat, or you may stop sweating entirely. These are serious signs for concern., If your symptoms worsen once you stop exercising or do not improve within the hour, seek medical treatment. You may be given intravenous (IV) fluids to help you rehydrate. Your doctor might also do a simple blood test to check your electrolytes like sodium and potassium, which can affect your health., The most severe form of heat illness, heat stroke, can actually be life-threatening. This occurs when your body temperature reaches 104˚F (40˚C) or higher. Heat stroke requires immediate medical care to cool the body in order to prevent permanent damage to your brain and other organs that can result in death.You may need to call an ambulance or alert someone to do it for you.


Symptoms of heat stroke include the absence of sweating or hot, flushed dry skin, fast heartbeat, difficulty breathing, strange behavior like being disoriented, clumsy, irritable, or confused, and seizures.

Drink plenty of water before you exercise.,
Use sports drinks to recover electrolytes.,
Calculate your fluid loss during exercise.,
Eat foods that contain a high percentage of water.",How to Avoid Caffeine Overdose for Athletes1," The amount of water you need varies from person to person, but generally you want to maintain consistent hydration to avoid becoming dehydrated by exercise, especially if you sweat a lot.The easiest way to determine whether you're well hydrated is to look at the color of your urine. If it's clear, you're well hydrated. The darker your urine, the more water you need to drink.
Start early in the day and rehydrate yourself regularly and consistently. Avoid chugging a large amount of water before starting exercise, however, since the sloshing in your stomach can make you feel sick.
Since caffeine is a mild diuretic, you may need to drink more water than you would otherwise to counteract that effect.;
, Particularly if you're engaged in vigorous physical activity, you may need more than just water to replace the liquid and nutrients you lose through sweat. Sports drinks can assist with this as well as giving your body more energy.Read the labels on sports drinks carefully, and avoid those with added sugars. To avoid caffeine overdose, you also may want to avoid sports drinks that have any amount of caffeine added.
Since most sports drinks have carbohydrates, sodium, potassium, and protein, you also may benefit by drinking them before exercise.
In most cases, sports drinks are only beneficial before or during exercise if you are involved in vigorous activity lasting 90 minutes or longer.

, To avoid becoming dehydrated during exercise, you must actively replace the fluid you lose through your sweat. This amount will vary among people, and depending on the conditions and environment in which you're engaging in physical activity.The easiest way to determine the total amount of fluid you are losing during exercise is to weigh yourself immediately before and then immediately after exercise.
Every pound of weight you've lost equates to approximately a pint of water. Keep in mind it's not unusual to lose as much as 5 pounds of fluid during intense exercise, especially if you are engaging in a vigorous activity that takes place outside in warmer months.

, Drinking water isn't the only way to stay hydrated. Foods with a high water percentage can be a good alternative to drinking water on its own, especially if you don't like the taste of water.Both watermelon (as the name suggests) and celery are more than 90 percent water, as well as cucumbers and strawberries. While celery isn't necessarily packed with nutrients, it is high in fiber and several other energy-sustaining nutrients such as potassium.
You also can get water from other drinks, such as coconut water or skim milk.

Take time to warm up.,
Determine your run intervals.,
Plot out your strength intervals.,
Plan your strength training intervals to fit your weekly routine.,
Cool down at the end.",How to Strength Train on a Treadmill1," Warm up your body by incorporating a brisk walk into the first three to five minutes of your workout. Walk at a speed that is fast enough to require an effort to maintain, but not so fast that you start to alter your breathing pattern.Generally, the recommended speed for a warmup walk is 3.5 to 4 mph (5.5 to 6.5 km/h), but you should adjust the speed for your level of ability and comfort.;
, Work in two and three minute segments for 30 to 60 minutes total and create a plan that alternates running at your natural speed, jogging, sprinting, and brisk walking. Leave every third or fourth interval open for a strength exercise.Try not to set two similar activities next to one another. Don’t, for example, create a session that has jogging followed by walking followed by jogging.
Sprints should not outnumber the walking or jogging intervals in your plan.
Test yourself on a treadmill to find your jogging, natural running, and sprinting speeds.

, In the intervals left open for strength training, determine what body weight strength exercises you want incorporated into your workout. Common exercises include push ups, crunches, planks, squats, burpees, and resistance band exercises such as side steps and rows.You may opt to practice more than one exercise during an interval. For example, you may hold a plank for 60 seconds, then squat for 60 seconds during a two minute interval.
You can also opt to keep a pair of dumbbells next to the treadmill to use for exercises such as squats and rows to add more resistance.

, If you choose to exercise twice a week, for example, focus on whole-body exercises. If you choose to work out five times a week, target different muscle groups each session.


Remember to plan recovery days, as well. Try to not strength train more than three consecutive days without rest.

, Once you have finished your workout, plan three to five minutes to cool down. This may include another brisk walk, or deep stretches such as lunges and bends to help keep your muscles from cramping.If you focused your strength intervals on a particular area of the body, such as the abs, focus your stretches on that area, as well.

Learn the signs of caffeine intoxication.,
Avoid energy drinks.,
Measure the amount of caffeine you consume.,
Eliminate caffeine several hours before and after you exercise.,
Abstain from caffeine several days before a major event.",How to Avoid Caffeine Overdose for Athletes2," The amount of caffeine you can safely consume depends on a lot of factors, including how hydrated you are; however, even as little as 500 milligrams of caffeine can potentially cause an overdose.Symptoms of caffeine intoxication include feelings of restlessness, nervousness, or agitation. You also may have gastrointestinal problems, twitching, or heart palpitations. At least five overdose symptoms must be present for an official diagnosis of caffeine intoxication.
Even if you haven't reached overdose levels, you should stop eating or drinking anything caffeinated for the day if you have trouble breathing, get dizzy, feel ""wired"" or twitchy, or if your heartbeat is rapid or irregular.
Keep in mind that caffeine can stay in your system for four to six hours after consumption.

, Energy drinks contain massive amounts of caffeine, and also include other sugars and preservatives that can wreak havoc on your body and ultimately cause you to fatigue more quickly, as well as have difficulty recovering after an athletic event.For example, a 10-hour energy shot contains 422 milligrams of caffeine. To put this in perspective, about 360 milligrams of caffeine is considered a safe amount for a healthy adult to consume in one day.
Energy drinks also include other substances that are supposed to enhance your energy. However, there is little valid scientific evidence to back up the energy-enhancing claims of these substances.

, To avoid caffeine overdose as an athlete, you must monitor your caffeine intake closely and be aware of the caffeine content in foods and drinks you regularly consume on a daily basis.A 16-ounce cup of coffee (the size of a grande at most popular coffee chains) has about 360 milligrams of coffee. This amount is considered safe for most adults to consume.
While coffee itself provides many health benefits, those benefits only apply to up to 500 milligrams of caffeine – about five cups of coffee at home. Any more than that, and the risks of caffeine overdose negate any benefit derived from the coffee.
Keep a food and drink diary and write down everything you consume that has caffeine in it. Then you can estimate the amount of caffeine you're consuming each day.
Check the nutrition labels of foods or drinks you consume that have caffeine to find out how much caffeine is in each serving. Remember that some packages may contain more than one individual serving.

, If you want the performance-enhancing effects of caffeine without risking caffeine overdose, it's generally best to consume your last caffeinated beverage no more than three or four hours before an athletic event.The caffeine in your bloodstream typically will already have peaked, but you will still see some performance enhancement because of your consumption.
If you've never done intense physical activity after ingesting caffeine, you may want to experiment before attempting to use it for performance enhancement. Pay attention to how your body reacts and adjust accordingly if you find yourself becoming jittery or unable to focus.

, This will allow your tolerance to decrease, ensuring you get the maximum benefit from caffeine on the day of the event. Be aware of signs of caffeine withdrawal, however, if you normally drink large amounts of caffeine.

Eat every two to three hours.,
Include carbohydrate and fiber sources at breakfast.,
Carb up before endurance events.,
Avoid sugar.,
Pack in protein at every meal.",How to Avoid Caffeine Overdose for Athletes3," You'll have more energy, and store less of your food as fat, if you eat small meals several times a day rather than only eating three large meals. If you can't fit multiple meals into your schedule, eat smaller portions than normal at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and have healthy snacks throughout the day.Eating on a regular basis keeps your blood sugar levels more stable, so you have a more steady energy supply throughout the day as well as during intense exercise.
If your body is getting enough energy from food sources, you won't need to rely on as much caffeine to give you a quick burst of energy, which can help you avoid caffeine overdose.
If you have trouble remembering to eat more often, or at appropriate times, consider setting a reminder on your phone or computer desktop calendar to send you a notification when it's time to eat something.

, Foods that are high in sugar and fat, such as breakfast pastries, can cause you to crash later on in the afternoon. Have a filling breakfast such as oatmeal or an omelette with plenty of fruits or vegetables.Commercial cereals also can provide plenty of nutrition, but read the labels carefully and make sure you're choosing something without added sugar.
A fruit and vegetable smoothie or a protein bar may be a good choice if you don't have a lot of time in the morning to cook up a more substantial breakfast.

, Slow-burning starches such as those found in potatoes, bread, and pasta will give you a steady source of energy for a longer period of time. If you need to exert intense effort for several hours, having a carbohydrate snack an hour or so before the event will keep you from hitting a wall before the end.Choose your carb sources carefully, and avoid refined carbs such as those in white bread and white pasta. Instead, look for whole-grain breads and pastas, or brown rice.
If you're on a gluten-free diet, look to foods such as quinoa, corn, and wild or brown rice to get the healthy carbs you need for energy., While sugar may give you a quick burst of energy, it fades quickly and can leave you even more run-down and fatigued than you were before. While eliminating sugar entirely from your diet may be impossible, you can reduce or eliminate many sweets that have added sugar.When you first start decreasing sugar, you may experience a drop in energy, especially if you previously consumed large amounts of sugar. However, over time this should even out.
Many energy drinks contain significant amounts of sugar in addition to caffeine. The sugar in these energy drinks may counter the benefits you get from the caffeine, and make it more difficult for your body to recover after intense exercise.

, Protein is essential to build and strengthen muscles. Most sources of protein also are good sources of iron, which is essential to maintain your overall metabolic rate.Typical sources of protein are lean meats such as chicken and turkey. You also can get protein in a shake made with whey powder, or in a snack of almonds and yogurt.
If you don't eat meat, eat plenty of soy-based foods and leafy dark green vegetables, such as spinach, for protein and iron.

Create a preliminary program.,
Build up endurance.,
Vary your intervals.",How to Strength Train on a Treadmill2," If you are looking to build lower body strength, an incline running plan can help you build up your glutes, hips, and leg muscles. Start with a gradually increasing incline plan, such as:1 mile (1.6 km) with no incline
0.75 mile (1.2 km) at two percent
Half a mile (0.8 km) at three perecent
0.25 mile (0.4 km) at four percent
Half a mile (0.8 km) at three perecent
0.75 mile (1.2 km) at two percent
1 (1.6 km) mile with no incline

, As you feel more comfortable with your incline workout, start building endurance by increasing your inclines. As you find your workouts are less challenging, generally every week to two weeks, increase the incline on each interval by one percent.Your workouts should raise your heartrate but not cause you so much strain that it’s difficult to breathe or that your muscles lock up. If you find a workout is too intense, dial it down.

, Create variation and mimic the impact of running hills by varying your incline and speed. Go from high inclines to relatively flat ones and then back to greater inclines, and adjust your speed as necessary to keep your heartrate up. Some treadmills have a built in function for such a workout, but if you’re planning one on your own, you could try:Half a mile (0.8 km) at nine percent
0.75 (1.2 km) mile at four percent
A mile (1.6 km) at eleven percent
Half a mile (0.8 km) at fifteen percent
0.25 (0.4 km) mile at two percent

Start with a gradual incline.,
Raise your incline.,
Add resistance.",How to Strength Train on a Treadmill3," A steady uphill walk or jog is a well-regarded way to help build muscle strength, especially for those who are just starting to strength train or those recovering from injury. Start with a gradual incline to help build your leg and core muscles. Warm up for five minutes by walking at a brisk pace with no incline.
Set your incline to something gradual to start, generally no more than about eight percent.
Walk consistently at that incline for 25 to 35 minutes.

, As you build your lower body muscles, you can start to increase your incline. Go up gradually as you feel your workouts become easier. Try to avoid increases larger than two percent at a time to avoid fatiguing your muscles.The steeper the walk, the more challenging for your muscles. You should feel your muscles getting tired, but not to the point where you cannot continue to walk or fail to properly support your body weight once your workout is finished.

, You may opt to wear a weight belt or ankle weights, or carry small hand weights as you walk to add resistance and build greater strength. Weight belts and ankle weights are good for engaging the core and increasing overall resistance, while hand weights can help you strengthen and tone your arms.Always be careful when using weights during an aerobic exercise. Make sure ankle weights and belts have a quick release option, and do not use hand weights that you cannot easily pick up and move.
Also, keep in mind that wearing ankle weights is like putting a load at the end of a long lever, which is your arm or leg. This can strain your joints and cause serious joint injuries or muscle, tendon, or ligament strains and tears. Do not wear ankle weights or carry dumbbells for longer than one minute. Take them off after one minute and take a break before putting them back on.

Drink water.",How to Stay in Shape," Goals can help you stay focused on maintaining your ideal body weight, body fat, muscle, and fitness levels. Ask yourself what your goals are. You might be looking to maintain your current fitness status or you might decide to improve in a particular area.

For example, if you are happy at your current weight, you might start looking at ways of maintaining your weight. This means consuming the same number of calories that you burn in a day.
Alternatively, if you have just lost body fat, you might want to start building muscle.
Now that you're in shape, you might aim to run your first 5K or take up a new activity, such as rock climbing.;
, If you have just recently reached your weight loss goals, it might be tempting to stop going to the gym, but it is important to keep exercising so that you can remain fit and healthy. If you don't keep exercising, you might gain back the weight that you have worked so hard to lose., Whether you have just finished a diet or if you have been maintaining your shape for a while, you should recognize that there are no one-time fixes that can keep you in shape for good. You will need to consistently maintain your exercise and eating routines to make sure that you do not undo all of your hard work.

Make exercise and healthy eating a priority. Schedule your work outs, and do not let your job or social commitments run into that time.
Remember, you are allowed occasional treats, but you should keep eating healthy on most days.
Always look for the healthiest option when eating out. If socializing with friends, cut down on how much alcohol you drink, and eat before you go to parties.

, Just walking alone is a very beneficial exercise which can help you stay in shape, feel more energetic, and get healthy. Not all exercise has to include painful muscles and lots of sweat! Walking is easy to fit into your basic daily activities too, making it one of the easiest solutions for staying in shape.


The easiest way to get more walking in is to park further away from wherever you’re trying to go. Park at the back of the parking lot in the mall, grocery store, or your workplace. You can even go further and park a block or two away from even the furthest reaches of the parking lot.The next easiest way to fit in more walking is to make sure that you’re always taking the stairs. Skip the elevator and escalator in favor of the stairs when you can.
A slightly more challenging but still very doable way to get more activity into your day is to start taking public transit. Not only will this save you a lot of gas money, but it usually involves at least slightly more walking than your normal commute. Google Maps has an excellent public transit planner (just select the bus icon when planning a route) which will help you figure out when to leave, what routes to take, and how much you’ll get to walk.

, Standing while you work can help your body get more activity than if you were just sitting down. Spend at least some of your work day standing instead of sitting in order to help your blood flow and maintain your muscles.


If you’re not sure what your boss would think about this change, just be strategic in how you introduce the idea: “If you help us make these changes, it will keep us healthier and happier, which means that you have to spend less money in the long run on healthcare costs for us.”
There are many desks available which you can purchase that switch between normal desk height and standing desk height. This will make it easy to take a break for sitting when the standing becomes too difficult for the task that you’re working on.

, You might also want to change how you sit when you do need to be in a chair. Switching to an exercise ball instead of a regular chair will go a long way towards helping you to maintain your core muscles and also keep you more alert.


If you find a basic exercise ball to be too difficult to balance on, you can also get specialized anchored models. These still have some benefit, but not quite as much as the normal ball.

, If you need to have a meeting at work and most of what you will be doing is simply talking and taking notes, consider getting your coworkers to join you in a walk around the halls or around the building, instead of just sitting in the meeting room. This will keep everyone more alert and also get you some activity which will help keep everyone energized.


You can take notes into your phone or even audio-record the meeting, if you’re worried about forgetting some of the information you discussed.

, Lots of household chores actually involve a lot of exercise and being better about doing chores can be a great way for you to fit activity and exercise into your day. Hoard the most exercise intensive chores for yourself and get your family doing everything else.


Exercise intensive chores include mowing grass using a push-mower, making the bed, doing the laundry, and scrubbing the bathtub.

, Instead of just sitting and staring at the wall when you’re on your work breaks, try taking a walk through the halls. This will help you stay alert, get re-energized, and also stay active.

, You might not have the time or want to spend an hour a day at the gym any more, but you do not necessarily have to in order to maintain your fitness level. While you should keep going to the gym, you should look for other ways to squeeze activity into your day. You can do this by splitting up your exercise time into shorter sessions throughout the day.


How much you need to do depends on your fitness level. Measure how much activity you did to get into shape, and spread the same amount of activity throughout your day.
For example, you can break up an hour of exercise into two or three sessions throughout your day. Do this at least five or six days out of the week.

, Some exercises will be more efficient than others, and choosing these more efficient exercises means that the amount of time that you do spend exercising will really count. Try to choose exercises that focus on your core muscles, since your legs and arms can get activity through daily activities like lifting bags of groceries and walking a longer distance from your car. Try:


Squats. Squats work on your core and leg muscles, and you can even add to the total body workout by adding weights so that your arms get work as well. This exercise is done by standing with your feet shoulder width apart and, keeping your back straight, bending your knees to lower your body as if you were sitting in a chair.
Planks. Planks are done by getting into something like a push-up position. However, instead of resting your upper body weight on your hands, rest your weight on your whole forearm instead and hold the position for as long as you can. The tension created between your arms and toes from trying to keep your body straight will be great for maintaining your core, leg, shoulder, neck, and upper arm muscles.
Burpees. Burpees are great because they exercise all areas of your body in just a few motions. This exercise is done by dropping from a standing position into a crouching position, thrusting your legs out backward into a push-up position (you can add an actual push-up if you want), jumping back into a crouching position, and then jumping up as high as you can (arms up).

, You can fit in lots of exercises in between your regular activities and while you are doing certain activities throughout your day. If you find places to fit in this exercise, it will be easy to stay in shape. By following this plan, you can easily fit 60 minutes of exercise into each day (not including extra walking or other activity that you might be able to fit into your day):


Try doing squats, jumping jacks, or counter top push offs while you cook dinner. Put a large can of tomato sauce in each hand and then do squats in front of your stove while your dinner cooks (or microwaves). The 10 minutes that spaghetti takes to cook, for example, is perfect for timing your exercise.
Do planks before getting into bed. Try to hold the plank for a minute or two. If you want, you can do push ups or lunges in between each plank. You can also do this when you first wake up but doing some gentle movements like stretches and other things to warm up your muscles will be crucial for preventing injury.
Do burpees during commercial breaks. Commercial breaks on American television now average between 13-16 minutes total per hour, giving you plenty of time to fit in some burpees. If you extend your activity to slight into the program itself, you should be able to fit in one or two 10 minute sets into your hour of television watching.

, Your commute can also be exercise, if you do it right. Forego your car in favor of alternative transportation forms. There are lots of different arrangements that you can try, depending on how much extra time you can find, how much exercise you want, and any other factors that you care about. Consider:


Riding your bike. Ride your bike to and from work. This works particularly well if you live 6–8 miles (9.7–12.9 km) away and have access to bathroom facilities where you can get cleaned up after you arrive. Bring your work clothes in a backpack along with anything you need to fix up your hair and face.
Combine a bike and bus. You can also combine riding a bike with a bit of riding public transit as well. Most buses have a bike rack at the front, which means you can ride the bus to work with your bike and then ride your bike home. You can also switch which goes first, or even ride the bus part way and then the bike the rest of the way.
If you live 2–4 miles (3.2–6.4 km) away and have access to bathroom facilities, you might want to consider running or jogging to work. This is great exercise and will wake you up way more than a cup of coffee.

, If you have children, think about exercising with your children. Overlapping time you spend playing with your kids with time you spend taking care of your bodies can be the smart move needed to make sure you have time to do both. Besides, it sets a good example for your kids, helping them to see how important it is to fit exercise into your life. For example, you can:


Go swimming at a local pool, beach, or lake
Take a hike
Play sports, such as Frisbee or soccer, at a local park
Visit a rock climbing gym
Race each other around the backyard
Play tag with each other

, You can also make exercising your social activity, if you don’t have kids but still struggle to find time. Put together a group with your friends and you can all take a cheap Pilates class once a week. This keeps you motivated, by giving you something to look forward to and people to be accountable to, but it also helps you find more time in your schedule by multitasking.

, You can also find more time by continuing your gym routine but spending the time that you are there multitasking.Take your activity with you and then get on a low-impact machine, like an elliptical, or a treadmill with a spot to put a book or papers.


Bring homework with you if you’re in school, reports that you need to read for work, paperwork that needs only basic things like signatures and initials...whatever you can do with minimal movement on your part.
Bring an audiobook or podcast on your iPod and listen while you work out. This is another way to make your time count, fitting in relaxation while you exercise.

, We tend to get caught up in the popular mentality that diets (like Atkins or South Beach) are the way to keep those pounds off, but a diet is not going to work long term. Diets can help you shed a few emergency pounds in a pinch, but what really makes a difference in the long run is proper lifestyle change. You can get by with minimal exercise if you eat healthy, properly proportioned meals. This will keep you energetic and it will also keep fat from building up and making it harder to be physical and stay in shape.

, Foods that contain trans fats or simple carbs, such as sugar or white flour, will make keeping the weight off more difficult. These are often found in baked goods, processed foods, and fried foods. Limit your consumption of these foods, or make them an occasional treat.


You can find trans fats in foods like margarine, microwave popcorn, some frozen meals, fried foods and commercially baked products (cookies, pizza, donuts, cakes, etc).
Simple carbs are found in products made from white flour, such as white bread, pasta, crackers, and white rice as well as products high in sugar like breakfast cereal, sugar, soda, and pastries.

, Healthy fats are vital for keeping your body healthy and maintaining your most important muscle: your heart! Polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats can usually be identified by the fact that they are liquid at room temperature.


You can find healthy fats in nuts, olive oil, avocados, and fatty fish like salmon and anchovies.

, Protein will help you maintain your muscles and also give you the energetic feeling that you may be missing now that you’re getting less exercise. When choosing a protein source, you want to look for lean proteins (proteins with minimal amounts of unhealthy fats) but you also want to look for complete proteins. Protein isn’t just one nutrient: it is often found in many different pieces in food, so you need to get enough of all of the different pieces in order for the protein to do its job in your body.


Good protein sources include skinless chicken, turkey, eggs, salmon, anchovies, sardines, oysters, almonds, walnuts, peanuts, peas, and quinoa.
Things like nuts, beans, and quinoa only have parts of protein and not a protein that’s already put together. Usually, you’ll need to eat meat in order to get a protein that is ready to go but you can also eat soy products (soy is the only non-meat source of a complete protein). If you’re a vegetarian, make sure that you’re eating more things like beans and nuts and that you’re getting a wide variety of different types of those protein sources, to help your body get all the pieces of protein that it needs to build a complete protein.

, You'll need to eat fewer calories now, as compared to when you were more active, if you don't want to start building up body fat. This means that the calories you do eat should be as packed with nutrients as you can possibly get them. Look for foods that have low calorie counts and fat but high portions of nutrients.


Nutrient packed foods include kale, spinach, broccoli, citrus fruit, apples, quinoa, oatmeal, barley, lentils, white beans, and fish.

, While you were getting in shape, you probably ate larger meals that were probably heavy on the protein. While you’ll still want to get plenty of protein, you’ll really want to balance that intake with other nutrient sources now. You’ll also want to eat smaller meals, to help you make sure that you’re getting the right amount of calories for your new activity level.


Generally, about ⅓ of your plate should be fruits and vegetables (leaning more heavily to the side of the vegetables, since fruit contains a lot of sugar) and ⅓ of your plate should be grains. The final third should be a mix of protein and low-fat dairy (cottage cheese, eggs, milk, etc).
For getting the right amount of food, you’ll probably need to do some math and tailor your diet to the number of calories your doctor recommends. However, an easy rule of thumb is to eat from a salad plate (or side plate) instead of a dinner plate and to wait at least 15 minutes before taking any more food.

, And of course, your body needs water. While you might not need as much water as when you were doing all that sweating to get into shape, you still definitely need water so don’t lose that vigilance. Drinking enough water also has the added bonus of keeping your hunger level down, helping you to maintain the lower calorie count that you’ll be getting now that you’re not exercising as much.The usual rule of thumb is that when your urine comes out pale, you're probably drinking enough water.

Use the hotel fitness room.,
Swim in the hotel pool.,
Walk the halls or grounds of the hotel.,
Rent a bike, pedal boat, or golf clubs.",How to Work out While Traveling1," Many hotels offer weight machines, treadmills, stationary bicycles, and fitness mats for stretching or exercising. Ask hotel staff where the fitness center is located in the building and what the hours are for the facility.


Do not attempt to use weight machines if you have not been trained on proper use, as poor technique can cause injury.;
, Swimming can be excellent exercise, and even a short amount of time using the resistance of the water will help burn calories and work multiple muscle groups.


Try treading water, swimming laps, or doing water aerobics for 30 to 60 minutes to get an excellent workout in the pool.

, Simply taking a walk, power walking, jogging, or climbing stairs in a hotel can offer plenty of opportunity for safe and effective exercise.


If the hotel has safe or attractive surroundings, take your exercise outside. Try walking or running the perimeter of the hotel a few times to get your workout in.
If the weather is poor or if you prefer to remain indoors, walk the halls and take the stairs between each floor. Alternately, take the stairs all the way up and all the way down as many times as you like at your own pace. This will give your legs a workout and help raise your heartbeat.

, Many hotels and resorts offer activities at a fee that can allow you to fit in a workout while you explore the area. Riding a bike, pedaling around a pond or lake, or walking with your clubs on a golf course can burn hundreds of calories and add make your workout seem like less of an inconvenience when you travel.

Perform a lunge and catch.,
Set aside time for your workout routine.,
Warm up for fencing.,
Avoid over-exerting yourself.,
Adopt a safe approach.,
Meet people to fence with.",How to Add Fencing to Your Fitness Routine," Working out your lower body with squats will improve your fencing. This is because your lower body enables you to get around and to respond quickly, to lunge, and to leap away from an opponent. To do a barbell squat:


Squat under the bar.
Grip the bar shoulder width.
Hold your chest up and elbows down.
Breathe in deeply and unrack the bar.
Come to a full stand while exhaling.
Complete 4 sets of 6 reps each. Make sure to rest at least 1 minute between sets.;
, Rowing exercises are another exercise that will help condition you for fencing. By rowing, you'll exercise your back, shoulders, and will contribute to a total body workout that will help you be a capable fencer.


Use a rowing machine for 20 minutes 3 to 5 times a day.
Avoid using a rowing machine if you feel any back or neck pain., Cardio exercise is fundamental in endurance training for fencing. By training your cardio, you’ll be able to move around your opponent quicker and without tiring as easily. Some good cardio activities include:


Running
Cycling
Swimming, A core component of fencing is learning how to dodge your opponents’ attacks. This aspect of fencing makes it a great work out. However, there are a variety of techniques you’ll need to learn to master the art of defensive dodging. Some moves include:


Stepping backward.
Stepping to the side.
Swaying leftward, rightward, or backward.
Repeat this as part of your cardio work out or endurance training., The lunge is a rapid forward motion used to get closer to an opponent before attacking. It is perhaps the most important movement in fencing. To complete a lunge:


Stand so that one foot is about a 12 inches (30.5 centimeters) in front of the other. This will be your forward lunge foot.
Lift your (forward foot) toe and elevate your heel slightly.
Move your right foot forward in a subtle kicking motion and use your back leg to propel you forward.
Make sure your right arm thrusts forward as you move.
As you move slightly into the air, your knee should be bent so it is over your toe.
End by having your right thigh parallel to the floor., Lateral bound lunges will work out your lower body, provide a great cardio workout, and help you hone your reflexes and responses.


Place two cones 4 to 6 feet apart. This depends on your height and ability to jump.
Jump from one side to the other. Feel free to jump as high as you feel comfortable with.
Try to land so that one foot is a foot ahead of the other. This will be your forward lunge foot.
Perform a fencing lunge after landing on the other side., Lateral hurdle progressions will work out many of the same things as lateral bound lunges, but will enable you to practice different movements prior to completing a lunge.


Place several low hurdles in a line.
While facing the hurdles sideways, bound forward two hurdles. Use as much energy as you feel comfortable using.
Bound back one hurdle until you’ve finished your hurdle line.
Complete a fencing lunge (of your choice) after the last hurdle., A lunge and catch can be incorporated into lunge exercise to add increased rigor and to test your reflexes and reaction time. To do a lunge and catch:


Complete a lunge exercise.
After completing, have a friend or trainer toss a ball to you. Feel free to use whatever size and weight ball you want, just make sure you can catch and throw it comfortably.
Drop or throw the ball back and repeat the exercise.
This will hone your reflexes and force you to think on your toes., When setting time aside, you need to be cognizant of time you’ll need to warm up, work out, and complete your fencing regimen. In addition, you need to factor in time to meet and work out with your partner, if you have one.


Set aside 3 to 4 times a week for your fencing and workout routine. For instance, choose Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
Put aside 10 to 20 minutes for warming up.
Set aside 30 minutes to an hour for days you do endurance training.
Reserve a minimum of an hour for individual fencing sessions with a partner. You will very likely have to build your schedule around your partner or others you play or workout with you.
Don't do endurance training on the same day as a match with a partner., On days you fence, you need to warm up. A warm up will allow you to loosen up your muscles and get your heart rate up. In the end, you’ll be able to fence much more effectively after warming up.


Walk briskly for 4 to 6 minutes.
Jog for 2 to 4 minutes.
Run for 2 minutes.
Do 2 to 4 intervals where you run very quickly for 30 seconds and then rest for 30 seconds., Fencing is a very involved and demanding sport. Thus, you need to make sure you’re not over-exerting yourself during your workout or during fencing matches. Consider:


Giving your muscles time to heal after working out or fencing. For example, take Tuesday off if you do endurance training on Monday. Then, participate in a match with your partner on Wednesday., As a combat-based sport, fencing is potentially very dangerous. Because of this, you need to embrace the best safety practices possible. Make sure to:


Wear all your safety gear including: fencing pants, fencing jacket, underarm protector or “plastron,” proper gloves, fencing mask, and fencing shoes or tennis shoes.
Do not use inappropriate, unsanctioned, weapons. This includes, but is not limited to: katanas, samurai swords, and machetes.
Never turn your back to your opponent.
Never run toward or away from your opponent.
See a doctor if you are injured or experience any pain after endurance training or a match., One of the biggest challenges to fencing regularly as part of an exercise routine is finding people to fence with. This is important, as without a partner, you won’t be able to do much more than simply train.


Join a fencing club in your area. The more populous your area, the better likelihood that there will be a club in your area. At fencing clubs, you’ll find other people who you can fence with regularly.
Contact the National Fencing Club for more information about clubs in your region.
If you don’t have a fencing club in your area, there may be some sort of fencing group or organization at a local college or university. If so, you can contact students or club members about sparring."
"
Exercise in the comfort of your room.,
Try yoga, Pilates, or Tae Bo.,
Buy a Pilates exercise DVD to watch on your computer while you workout in your room.,
Make up your own routine.",How to Work out While Traveling2," Many effective workouts can be performed without equipment or special facilities. You can get a great workout without leaving your hotel room or guest quarters.


Use your body to create resistance. Do push-ups, sit-ups, lunges, strength training, jumping jacks, jogging in place, and other basic moves to work your muscle groups, stretch, and get your heartbeat up.

, With a little advance preparation or with the guide of a television or DVD exercise program, these types of exercise can often be performed in small, private spaces on the go.


Lay a towel on the floor of the hotel room and use it as a mat for yoga stretches such as downward dog, sun salutations, and other poses that will help relieve the tension from traveling while working your muscles and toning your core.

,


Improvise a Tae Bo routine in your room by alternating punches and kicks in the air with your hands and feet, keeping muscles contracted and moving deliberately as you listen to music or watch a television program. Jog in place or bounce backward and forward while punching to burn extra calories.

, Get creative by combining a variety of short exercises or physical activities that make you short of breath or give your muscles a workout. Improvise materials if necessary to perform strength training routines or resistance training without equipment if necessary.


Alternate stair climbing with lunges down the hallways, perform bicep curls with water bottles, or substitute a towel or article of clothing for a resistance band. Then try doing chair lifts, scissor kicks, and even jumping on the bed to get your heart rate up and your routine full of variety and fun.

Roll up a small foam yoga mat.,
Pack hand-held weights.,
Invest in resistance bands.,
Bring a Frisbee, football, or tennis racquet.,
Deflate an exercise ball.",How to Work out While Traveling3," Foam mats not only roll into less space than firmer or thicker mats, but they are often also very affordable and weigh substantially less than traditional yoga mats.


If you enjoy yoga when traveling, hemp bands and lightweight foam blocks are also easy to fit in a suitcase without adding much weight.

, Light hand weights or ankle weights are compact and can fit into most suitcases with ease.


To spare yourself the strain of an overly heavy bag, refrain from packing more than one set or packing any weights over 5 pounds each.

, Rubber or cloth resistance bands offer a very wide range of exercise options with virtually no added bulk or weight to your suitcase.

, If you are traveling with friends, family, or coworkers, having a team sport item along may enable you all to get a workout while having fun.


Lightweight items such as deflated sports balls, tennis or racquetball racquets, and even a baseball and glove can provide hours of exercise options with little added weight to the suitcase.

, Many brands sell inflatable fitness balls. Pack a deflated ball to re-inflate upon arrival at your destination (be sure to check whether the ball requires a hand pump or if you can inflate it with your own air).


Yoga, aerobics, strength training, and resistance workouts can easily incorporate an exercise ball to make a workout easy while traveling.

Go dancing.,
Find a jogging path, park, or popular street.,
Sign up for an exercise class.,
Call the local YMCA or community gymnasium.",How to Work out While Traveling4," Traveling can be an excellent excuse to try salsa, tango, swing, the waltz, or even hip-hop dancing. Head to a club to get your workout while socializing or pick a restaurant that offers a dance floor and live music to burn calories and have fun at the same time.

, Just by packing your running shoes you can combine sightseeing with working out. Jog through the parks, along picturesque waterways, or up and down past shops and restaurants to get your workout done, while exploring the city or even picking out where to go for dinner.

, Traveling can offer plenty of opportunities to try a local zumba, belly dancing, boot camp, yoga, or other specialty class at a workout studio, supporting local businesses and helping you fit your workout into your travel schedule.

, In many cities, public workout facilities allow visitor passes by the day or week for a very reasonable fee, giving you access to pools, tracks, basketball or tennis courts, and even instructor-led classes.

Start with freestyle.,
Move on to the breaststroke.,
Switch to the backstroke.,
Challenge yourself with the butterfly stroke.,
Improve your kicks with kick board laps.",How to Swim to Stay Fit1," The freestyle stroke is perhaps the most popular competitive swimming stroke, and it's good for stretching your entire body. You'll get a particularly good workout of your shoulders and back, biceps, triceps, quadriceps, glutes, and hamstrings.To swim freestyle, you'll be on your stomach in the water. Push off from the wall and extend your arms straight out in front of you. You'll pull your body forward with your arms by lowering one arm deep into the water and circling it back around when it reaches the outside of your thigh.
As you're bringing one arm up, push the other arm down to repeat the motion. Rotate your body with the stroke.
Do flutter kicks with your legs to help propel your body forward. You may want to practice your flutter kicks while holding on to the wall.;
, While the breaststroke can be technically difficult to perform well, it can be a relaxing stroke because you can better control the pace. It provides the same whole-body benefits as freestyle, and can be a good stroke to alternate for slower laps.For the breaststroke, move both of your arms at the same time. Start on your stomach on the water with your arms out in front of you. Push both hands down into the water and back, propelling your body forward. Continue the cycle, bringing your hands out of the water and then back down again.
For the breaststroke kick, bring your knees together and tuck them in towards your body, then push them out and apart from each other, kicking in a circular motion – out, and then coming back together again.
Coordinate your arms and legs so that you're kicking out as your arms are up out of the water, and tucking your knees in ad you push your hands down into the water.
The breaststroke may exacerbate existing neck, back, or knee injuries. If these areas are an issue for you, talk to your health care provider before you start doing the breaststroke.

, With the backstroke you can breathe normally the whole time, so you can use this stroke if you want to take a break from the more technical breathing required for other strokes. The backstroke can improve your posture by extending your back and shoulder muscles.Try to keep your body as flat as possible at the surface of the water. If you let your hips dip too far down, it can slow you down.
The backstroke is more or less the same as freestyle, only you're laying on your back instead of on your stomach.
When you swim the backstroke, you'll be looking at the ceiling the whole time. Identify markers that will let you know when you're near the end of your lane so you don't run into the wall.

, The butterfly stroke is a difficult stroke to pull off technically, and exhausting to maintain physically. But if you are swimming several different strokes, it can provide a break from the monotony.Sweep your arms out, then down and out to form a ""Y"" shape in front of your body. Push them down and back along the sides of your body and then shove them forward to start the stroke again. These movements should be powerful, using your full range of motion.
To kick, propel your legs outward from your hips. Break the surface of the water with your heels and the soles of your feet, then bring your feet together and push them down against the water to propel yourself forward.
The butterfly stroke is a real calorie burner that can help you burn as many as 800 calories in an hour., If you need to improve the efficiency or power of your kicks, kick board laps allow you to focus on your kick strokes without worrying about your arms.You also can use kick board laps as a restful break between harder, faster swimming laps.

Set your fitness goals.,
Search online for workout plans.,
Join a class.,
Swim consistently.,
Vary your routine.,
Join forces with a buddy.,
Include a cool-down at the end of each swim.",How to Swim to Stay Fit2," The type of swimming you do to stay fit will depend on what you want to accomplish with your fitness routine. For most fitness swimmers, a combination of strokes is used to provide a full-body workout.For example, if you want to lose weight, you'll want to focus on the strokes that you can perform well and for the longest period of time, so you can get the greatest fat-burning benefits out of your exercise sessions.
Once you've identified your major goal or goals, break them down into small, reachable goals so you can constantly monitor your progress and get a continual sense of achievement.

, Once you've gotten used to swimming regularly, you'll get more out of each swimming session if you follow a specific plan rather than simply lapping up and down the pool without focus.Check swimming sites online, such as the U.S. Masters Swimming Program at usms.org, or the England Masters at swimming.org. You'll find various swimming plans tailored to achieving particular fitness goals, as well as tips on how to improve the efficiency of your stroke.
Other fitness clubs or local swimming clubs also may publish swimming workout routines on their websites. Some pools also provide suggested workout programs on laminated sheets along the walls of the pool area or locker room.

, Particularly if you're just getting started with swimming, you may benefit from the structure of a class and an instructor who can correct your form. There are a wide variety of classes available if you want to swim to stay fit.If you find the idea of swimming laps boring, you might enjoy a water aerobics class, or a different water exercise class.
You also might choose different classes to meet your specific fitness goals. For example, if you want to improve your flexibility, you might try a water yoga class.

, You'll only see overall fitness benefits if you swim on a regular basis. Ideally, try to swim at least two or three times a week. Even if you can only swim once a week, you'll still improve your fitness provided you're keeping active in other ways.If you've just started, even those first few laps may prove more difficult than you anticipated. Just keep with it. Aim to increase the amount of time you swim with each visit.
For example, your first few swims you may only be able to swim for 10 minutes. After a few 10-minute swims, increase your time to 15 minutes. The next week, increase your time again until you've built up to 45- or 60-minute swims.

, Even if you're a proficient swimmer, you should include other types of exercise besides just swimming laps. If you want to keep your workout in the water, consider taking a water aerobics class.Variety is important when swimming laps as well. Sticking to a single stroke can get boring after awhile, which can make it difficult to stay motivated and stick with your fitness routine.
It also can be beneficial to supplement your swimming workouts with strength training workouts to help build your muscles. Focus on exercises that build the muscles you use the most when swimming, such as your shoulders, arms, and legs.

, Rather than going it alone, getting a swim coach or swimming with a friend or family member can help you stay motivated. If you enjoy a little friendly competition, you can race each other or compete for most laps or fastest overall time.You also may be less inclined to skip swimming sessions if there's another person involved who is counting on you to show up and well help keep you honest.

, As with any exercise, you want to start your swimming session with a warm-up and end it with a cool-down to give your body a chance to readjust to its pre-exercise state.With a swimming workout, a few slow laps at the beginning and end of your session function perfectly well as a warm-up or a cool-down.
You also may want to treat yourself to a hot tub or sauna if those are available where you swim. If your pool has a café, a healthy snack or protein shake after your swim can be invigorating and rewarding.

Scout out swimming locations.,
Buy appropriate swimwear.,
Get other equipment if needed.,
Learn proper stroke techniques.",How to Swim to Stay Fit3," If you want to swim to stay fit, you first must find a pool that is convenient to you. Ideally, you want to find an indoor pool so you can continue your swimming regimen year round.Find out what classes are available at the pool, as well as the cost to use the pool. These fees can add up, so ask if you can purchase a monthly or yearly membership that will give you unlimited access to the pool for less money.
Carefully inspect the pool and facilities. Ask staff about pool maintenance and make sure everything is kept clean and sanitary.

, One of the best parts about swimming to stay fit is that you typically don't need to invest in a lot of equipment to get started. However, you will need at least one swimsuit that is comfortable and functional for swimming.If you're wearing a women's swimsuit, choose a one piece and move around in it to make sure it fits well and the straps won't slide off while you're swimming.
If you're wearing men's swimming trunks, choose those that cling rather than board shorts or other loose, flappy shorts.
You may want to cover more of your body for modesty reasons. Most pools allow full wetsuits that cover your arms and legs. Talk to the staff at the pool where you plan to swim so you can better understand your options., At a minimum, you'll probably want to buy a pair of googles to protect your eyes from the chlorine. If you have longer hair, you also may want to get a swim cap to keep your hair from getting in your way while you're swimming.Some pools may provide towels, but you may want to invest in a more super-absorbent towel for quick hops out of the pool for a water or bathroom break.
Flippers or fins, hand paddles, and kick boards are swimming equipment used in perfecting your stroke or increasing your speed. Many pools loan these out for free or for a small rental charge. If you find you use these items regularly in your swimming routines, however, you may eventually want to buy your own.

, If you've never taken formal swimming lessons before, or if you last took lessons as a small child, you might want to take some lessons before you start swimming for fitness.Working with a swim coach for your first few sessions will help you perfect your form and correct any bad habits you may have developed over the years.
You also need to focus on your breathing technique. Incorrect breathing will sap your energy level and make your stroke less effective.

Clean your house.,
Do yard work or garden.,
Do a workout at home.,
Stay active with family and friends.",How to Add Physical Activity to Leisure Time1," Although it’s not commonly thought of as a physical activity, household cleaning is a great way to pass your leisure time, and to avoid succumbing to a sedentary afternoon or evening. Focus on more physically demanding aspects of cleaning: vacuuming, sweeping, scrubbing out sinks and bathtubs, and washing dishes by hand.Cleaning daily is an effective form of activity, as it involves plenty of physical activity: lifting, bending, stretching, and repeated physical motions can raise your heart rate and improve your health.;
, Rather than paying someone else to rake your leaves, pull weeds, trim hedges, and mow your lawn, take care of these activities yourself. Although yardwork is typically thought of as a chore, it can be a great way to spend time outside doing physically taxing activities.If you have a garden—or would like to start one—it is a great opportunity to spend your leisure time in a physically active way. Plant vegetables and flowers that will grow well in your area, and tend and water the plants daily.
Sweeping is one of the best ab workouts you can get. Sweep your front steps, walkways or driveway for a great workout.

, If you don’t often visit a gym because of the financial or time commitment involved, plan to work out at your home, during leisure time, instead. If you don’t already own any weights, dumbbells, or exercise equipment (such as a treadmill or exercise ball), then you might begin by making a small investment in the equipment you’ll be most likely to use.Keep in mind that weights and equipment are not necessary to be more active and get good exercise.

, Especially if you live with your family or with a roommate, incorporate an activity with them into your leisure time. Look for an activity that your family members can all participate in together, such as a family swimming, aerobics, mini golf, bowling, or yoga class.Ask your roommate or a small group of friends to take up an active hobby with you, such as playing tennis or jogging.
If you have children, consider taking them on a “family walk” following your evening meal. You can walk around the streets of your neighborhood, even for as little as half an hour. If the kids would prefer, they can ride bikes instead of walking."
"
Bicycle rather than driving.,
Walk to nearby locations.,
Pick up a new hobby or sport.",How to Add Physical Activity to Leisure Time2," When you’re outside going somewhere—whether it’s to work, to visit a friend, or for a short shopping trip—plan to use a physically engaging form of transportation, rather than driving yourself in your car. Riding a bicycle will increase your heart rate and help you get some fresh air.If your destination is too far to bike to, consider taking public transportation. Since you’ll still have to walk to and from the bus stop, you’ll get more exercise than if you were to drive your own car.

, Walking is one of the healthiest physical activities you can perform, and it’s also a great way to pass your leisure time. You can always take a walk (of any length) for pleasure.


If you’re planning to visit a local store or park, walk there instead of driving.Even if you’re planning to meet friends at a local bar or restaurant, plan ahead, leave half an hour early, and walk instead of driving.
If you’re out shopping during your leisure time, plan to park far out in the parking lot and walk to the store, rather than parking in a spot near the entrance. This will provide a couple minutes of activity, and give the added benefit of protecting your car from dings or scrapes on the door., Picking up a physical hobby is a great way to stay active during leisure time. This doesn’t have to be physically demanding activity, or one that requires athleticism to begin.


If you live near a lake, rent a canoe and spend half an hour paddling around.
If you prefer to move around more than canoeing allows, grab a bike or a pair of roller skates and ride over to a local park.If you live near a recreation center, spend time daily playing basketball, racquetball, or participating in an indoor sport such as swimming.

Reduce your health risks through physical activity.,
Identify your physical goals.,
Be physical daily to improve your mood and stress levels.",How to Add Physical Activity to Leisure Time3," A sedentary lifestyle and inadequate physical exercise have been linked to numerous health problems, some potentially fatal, including heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. The majority of adults worldwide do not participate in adequate amounts of activity.Activity during leisure time is a great way to combat this statistic and keep your body healthy.
Physical activity doesn’t need to be exercise-based, necessarily. While exercise focuses on repeated strenuous activity with the intent of increasing performance, muscle mass, or skill, physical activity simply needs to involve movement and physical work.

, While some individuals may choose to be physically active to maintain a healthy lifestyle and lower the risks of diseases (such as previously mentioned), others may decide to lose a certain amount of weight, or even decide to participate in a performance-based activity such as a 5k run or a 10k race.To lose weight, you’ll need to focus on cardiovascular exercise in combination with a reduced calorie diet, which will also help improve endurance-based physical activities.
Even if you have no specific endurance- or performance-based goals, you should still aim to be active for at least 30 minutes a day. Even if you spend this time walking or doing another form of low-exertion activity, it will improve your overall health., In addition to helping you lose weight and combat potential threats from disease, physical activity—especially activity done during leisure time which would otherwise be spent in sedentary activities—can both improve your mood and relieve stress.When you perform physical activities, your brain releases chemicals that induce happiness and feelings of relaxation.
Physical activity—and especially forms of exercise—cause nutrients and oxygen to rush to your muscle tissue, increasing your energy throughout the day.

Choose your theme.,
Plan your clues.,
Plan your treasure.,
Hide your clues.,
Send them on their treasure hunt.",How to Make a Treasure Hunt1," Themes make your treasure hunt fun especially if you choose a theme based on the interests of those participating. For example, if your son likes pirates, you can make a pirate treasure hunt for him and his classmates.Other possible themes are: Disney princesses, dinosaurs, ancient Egypt, jungle, Indiana Jones, carnival, camping, fairies, mystery, current events, tv shows, videogames, etc.;
, Find clues online or brainstorm clues based on how old and savvy the players are. The players need the clues to get from one spot to the next. Riddles are great for older players who need more challenging clues. In contrast, younger players may enjoy fun clues like rhymes. If there are very young players, you can just use pictures as clues.Choose the number of clues according to how much time you have and how many players are participating. Try to make the clues stick to the theme of your treasure hunt. If you are making a dinosaur treasure hunt, relate each clue to a different dinosaur.
An example of a riddle is, “I have a face that never frowns, hands that do not wave, no mouth but a familiar sound. I can’t walk but I move around.”
An example of clue sequence would be: Clue #1: When your hunger strikes your mood, it leads you here to get some food. (Place Clue #2 in the pantry.) Clue #2: Hooray, you’ve made it to number two. To get to number three, put these on before your shoe. (Place Clue #3 in the sock drawer.)

, Choose a variety of prizes that relate to the theme of your treasure hunt. There may be players with food allergies so be sure to ask if you’re including snacks or treats. Plan the treasure in private so no players can cheat. You may use an old container, decorate it, and fill it with toys and treats from the dollar store.Prizes can include candy, pencils, toys, coins, light-up necklaces, glow sticks, sports tickets, or more lavish prizes like a vacation . If you design your own box, you can ask other players to help you decorate it. You may also skip using a single treasure chest and use individual prize bags. For a no-frills approach, simply decorate brown paper bags and fill each with prizes.

, Make sure that the players cannot see you as you place the clues around the house, office, or outside if weather permits. Make sure you keep the clues accessible if you have small children playing. Place the clues far apart and in locations that aren’t similar. You don’t want a player finding the wrong clue.You can get the kids to eat a snack or plant the clues while the kids are at school. Make sure that they are always supervised so you don’t risk having someone wander over to sneak a peek at you while you are hiding the clues.

, Gather the players and explain the rules. Make sure they know what’s out of bounds. You don’t want them wandering into a dangerous room or a restricted area, like outside, if they aren’t allowed. Split a larger group into teams and make sure there’s an equal amount of skill in each team. For example, avoid placing all the fast kids or good readers in one team.Get the players to be in costume if you are doing a themed treasure hunt. Make sure each player gets a chance to read a clue out loud. Also, ensure that everyone is participating and that brainstorming is fun and no one is being picked on. Don’t let a single person dictate all the answers and directions. Make sure each team works together and cooperates.
Cheer them on and don’t give away answers.

"
"
Find ideas online if the brainstorming of your group won’t suffice.,
Create a photo hunt.,
Create a scavenger hunt.,
Begin a map hunt.,
Appeal to the imagination of little kids.",How to Make a Treasure Hunt2," There are many different treasure hunts online. If you feel stuck, don’t know where to start, or the ideas you have are too complicated for your resources, check online for what may suit the players involved. You may also start with their interests, like robots, and search for treasure hunts that will appeal to them.

, Get players or teams to use cameras or their phones to find different things by taking photos of them. Create a list for everyone to follow and look through the list together. The first team with all the photos wins.For example, you could ask different departments from your office to scour the city for landmarks or have a class of second graders take pictures of certain furniture or shapes around the house. You may also choose activities, like forming a human pyramid, to take a picture of.
You may make harder to get photos worth more points and make sure to give a time limit. The team with the most points at the end of the given time wins.

, Create a list of fun and hard-to-find items. Make sure you set boundaries of where players or teams are allowed to search. Give copies of the list to everyone playing. Make sure that it’s against the rules to steal and give a time limit to find everything.First team to find everything on the list wins. A list can include an old magazine, the smallest or largest fruit in the house, funny pictures, a person wearing a certain uniform (fireman for example), or whatever else suits the age and skill of the players.

, Create a map of your home, your backyard, or your neighbourhood. Make sure the playing area is suitable for the age and skill of your players. Place an X for each location of a clue. You may also just use an X to mark the location of the first clue which will lead them to the next clue until they have found the treasure.For example, the first clue may be something similar to, “walk 40 paces to the east and turn to your left and walk two paces. Climb the big log and look under the green statue for clue number two.
You may also find useful maps online that can be applied to your classroom or home.

, Create a treasure hunt for younger kids by using their imagination along with big and bold images. Be a good storyteller to get them to each clue. You may also have a prize at each clue or, for a larger group, have them return to a central location after they find each clue to claim their prize.You may create two sets of clues for each team or sets of clues for each player if the group is small. This way the kids can exchange stories about what they find after the game.
Make sure that everyone gets to partake in finding the treasure. Very small kids will easily become jealous or feel left out so have them be involved in finding some part of the treasure.

Put each letterbox item in a separate bag.,
Make your own rubber stamp inspired by your hiding spot.,
Unlined sketch pads are popular for letterbox logbook/journals.,
Wrap your stamp in felt, fabric or a small amount of paper towel before placing it in its bag, this protects other items from residual ink.

Place the label inside a clear box so you can read it from the outside or insure the label won't wear off if placed on the outside.",How to Pack a Letterbox," The spot should be discreet and your box should not be visible or you run the risk of it being mistaken for trash or catch the eye of a curious vandal.;
, You may also want a box to include a pen, pencil, special ink-pads or even a ""hitchhiker"".

, You may want to double bag the journal/logbook. Quart size works well.

, A lousy hand carved stamp is better than a purchased stamp, but if you aren't an artist, consider purchasing a stamp that represents your hiding place well or have one custom made.

, Or you can be creative and make a unique journal, index cards, cash register receipt scrolls or you can make a custom journal to fit your letterbox.

Make use of the lighter weight.,
Keep it simple.,
Have an entry level metal detector as a back-up in the event that your primary metal detector does not work and is being repaired.,
Use a simple metal detector when you want to be unobtrusive.,
Compare your metal detector to a higher priced detector for its sturdiness.,
Overcome the lack of a ground balance feature on the entry level metal detector.,
Keep away from wet sand.,
Wait for when the grass is cut.,
Do air tests to determine the depth capability of your metal detector.",How to Use an Entry Level Metal Detector," A higher priced metal detector will usually be heavier, so use your entry level detector for its lighter weight. A decrease in weight equals more time using it, and finding more treasures. A metal detector that is a pound lighter will be immensely more comfortable to swing for longer.;
, An entry level detector will have simpler controls, so use it for when you want some simplicity. When introducing a beginner to this fun activity, a simple machine will be easier to use and find treasure.

, Repairs typically involve shipping and time. By having an arsenal of two metal detectors, your metal detecting can continue without interruption.

, Also, to be unobtrusive, coin pop instead of making plugs with a hunting knife or hunting knife-like tool.

, Be careful, the aluminum and plastic rods and the plastic bolt, at the coil to rod attachment, are smaller.


The most vulnerable area is the coil attachment to the plastic rod, protect this weak spot by not exerting excessive force on it. Do not abuse or lose the two, small rubber washers at the coil to rod connection.

, On wet sand and grass with dew, ignore the false signals or ""chatter"". Always have a penny, nickel, dime and quarter to do air tests. Remember the sound of the coins, as they will be distinctive from the chatter or static from the wet sand, wet grass or high grass.

, As a beginner, or introducing a beginner to metal detecting, steer clear of the wet sand. Wait until mid morning, when coin shooting, because by then the dew will have evaporated.

, When coin shooting, exploit the days after the lawn grass has been cut. After the grass is cut, you will have more depth and less static because when the grass is high, you must press down on it.

, Even if it causes false signals, swing your coil directly on sand or grass, a bit, to have that depth detection. Generally, an entry level metal detector will have a bit less depth capability, but this will absolutely not keep you from finding many treasures.


Protect the coil with a coil cover.

Scoot all the way back in the chair until your back is against the chair. Keep your spine straight. Place your feet flat on the floor. While keeping your feet flat on the floor, scoot forward in your chair until you feel the top of your thigh stretch. Hold this position for 20 to 30 seconds.Repeat this stretch two to three more times, bending your knee a little further each time. Take a break for a few seconds in between stretches.;
, This stretches the muscles in your lower back and buttocks to improve mobility, but it may not be suited for those who have knee pain.Sit in a chair with your back straight. Place your hands around the affected knee. Slowly lift your knee toward your chest. Using your hands, pull your leg toward you until you feel the stretch in the back of your hip. Hold this position for 20 to 30 seconds.Repeat this stretch two to three more times, bending your knee a little further each time. Relax for a few seconds in between stretches.

, Stand in front of a chair with armrests. Place your knee on the chair. Position a rolled or folded towel between the back of your knee and calf. Stabilize yourself by placing your hands on the armrests, and keep your back straight. Then slowly sit back onto your heel until you feel a stretch in the front of your thigh. Hold this position for 20 to 30 seconds.Repeat this stretch two more times. Take a brief break in between stretches.

Explore your regular places more fully.,
Metal detect close to home besides going far and wide.,
Construct a list of equipment and other items to bring.,
Metal detecting is inherently a goal-oriented activity, find treasures consistently to maintain your interest.,
Do not metal detect a new place in a grid-like pattern that misses very little.,
Have a range of ratios of trash, such as pull tabs and bottle caps, to treasure.,

Do not focus on money as your main reason to metal detect.,
Think of each new place like a puzzle to be solved in a short amount of time.,
Be thoughtful, fill up your holes, and haul out your trash finds.",How to Metal Detect for Adventure," At month's end, a review which outings were at new places. Have a minimum goal of exploring new places at each monthly report.;
, Jot down on paper, random thoughts of places you want to go to.

, Have a shipping box for your metal detector and equipment. Research where to go and what you will find.

, It will enable you to detect in different ground conditions.

, Dry sand metal detecting is a great way to start beach metal detecting, after a while move on the wet sand. With wet sand, you will find more jewelry, find even more jewelry by going into the water with a waterproof metal detector. Move from the sand to the grass, and find less jewelry but more coins.

, Internet search the best places to metal detect, and you will find many ideas of places to try that are close to home such as vacant lots, old school sites, railroad stations, backyards, etc.

, If you travel far, it will be time-consuming to return home to fetch a vital piece of equipment.

, Record where you went and what you found. Annually, tally your finds and notice patterns and changes in your outlook. Be true to yourself and fulfill your longings to visit new places even if you suspect that the outcome will not be fruitful.

, Watch your time, explore each place quickly and in a superficial manner. Initially, go through a mental list of places to find treasure. Your mental list, of places at a beach metal detect, would apply to all beaches. If your preference is concise detecting, keep careful records and expect big swings in your finds journal.

, However, if this ratio is not acceptable in a certain section, move on to another section or change your plan of action. If finding jewelry is part your goals, have a correct ratio of nickels to other coins. Since pull tabs and nickels have similar characteristics, think of pull tabs as a cost of doing business.

, For example, dew on the grass is a greater problem than early morning moisture on sand, metal detect the sand first until the dew disappears.

, Enjoy the scenery, fresh air, exercise, sunshine and the challenge.

, Put on your thinking cap when all else fails. Move and think quickly, because as an adventurer your time is limited; travel time and other factors associated with going to new places will diminish your detecting time.

, Respond politely to the questions that you will be asked by the curious.

Determine what type of treasure you are looking for and what type of tools you need to find it.,
Choose a location where you want to start your treasure hunt.,
Seek areas that indicate treasure has been found in the past.,
Use a GPS unit to track the locations that you have visited and to avoid hitting the same place twice.

",How to Find Treasure,"


If you are searching for gold or other precious metals, consider purchasing a metal detector.
If you plan to find collectibles or antiquities, study up on their valuation and how to recognize them. This can include purchasing books on the subject or doing research online.
Brush up on your history if you are looking for historic treasures like old ships, valuable documents or other historical items.;
, Make sure that you understand the rules of the location so that you aren't stealing from another individual, a country or an organization.


Feel free to roam public beaches with your metal detector looking for coins and other treasure. Because you are on public land, what you find is yours. You should also consider going to a more secluded beach in order to increase your likelihood of a good find.
Scour antique stores, garage sales and flea markets to look for that hidden find that has been overlooked by sellers and other shoppers. By studying up on the features of what you are looking for and being able to discern fakes will help you with easier identification the item you are seeking.
For historical items such as arrowheads, old documents and other antiquities, make sure that you have the proper credentials or permission to be seeking them out.
Look for old homesteads, and with permission, seek out vintage items such as coins, watches, old silver spoons and more. Before there were banks, or before people trusted them, many people hid their valuables on their property. What you find could be their old trash or their old valuables, and this would be applicable at places like old rail stations, mining locations or lumber camps.

, Popular treasure beaches sometimes have additional items wash up in the same or similar spots when strong storms come through.

Practice stretches daily.,
Stretch in child’s pose.,
Do some squats.,
Stretch in a kneeling lunge.,
Perform a ragdoll pose stretch.,
Sit in the butterfly stretch position.,
Return to a standing position and perform a standing straddle.,
Sit back on the ground while maintaining the straddle position.,
Reach your arms out to your sides.,
Stand with your feet together, heels and toes touching.,
Stretch your arms up over your head.,
Bend forward from the waist.",How to Improve Your Toe Touch," Being able to touch your toes involves quite a few muscles. Enhancing your overall strength and flexibility with some targeted movements will help improve your toe touch and reduce your risk of injury.;
, Child’s pose helps stretch your low-back extensors, which will increase your forward range of motion.It can also increase freedom of movement in your pelvic area.


Kneel on a yoga mat and reach your arms in front of you with palms facing down.
Sit back on your heels and lower your arms and forehead to the floor (or a yoga block, if you need some extra support).
Take five deep, slow breaths, then release the position.
Stretch in child's pose once before doing the rest of the exercises in this part, and once after completing the exercises.

, Squats are excellent for building strength and increasing flexibility. Proper form is essential when doing squats, but done correctly, they’ll help you with your toe touch. Do only 1-2 sets of three repetitions to start out; you can increase the number of sets as you grow stronger.


Begin with your feet shoulder-width apart and your toes facing slightly outward (don’t force them). Your knees should be relaxed, not locked or hyperextended.
Reach your arms in front of you at shoulder height. Look in front of you just above your hands. This should keep your head in a neutral position through the squat. You don’t want to look down or look up too far.
Exhale as you move your hips backward. Pretend that you are sitting down on an imaginary chair. Make sure your heels don’t lift as you sit.
Once you are as low as you can go without your back arching or heels lifting, hold the position for three long, slow breaths, then release. Repeat three times., Kneeling lunges help release tight hip flexors, which will allow your hips to move more freely in a toe touch. They will also help loosen your hamstrings and quadriceps, which helps reduce the risk of injury. Start with a single short set of 4-5 reps and work up until you can do 2-3 sets of 10 lunges each.Begin by standing in a comfortable position with your knees relaxed and your arms hanging loosely to your sides.
Step forward with one foot and lean forward, keeping your back neutral (don’t arch it or over-flatten it) and the other knee bent.
As you enter the lunge, place your hands on your front thigh and lower your pelvis until your back knee is parallel to the ground. Keep your hips facing forward.
Squeeze your buttocks and hold the lunge for a deep breath. Then return to standing.

, The ragdoll will help loosen your hamstrings and increase range of motion, but it is less intense than a full forward fold so it’s great for beginners and those with limited flexibility. You don't need to repeat this stretch in sets; just make sure you stay loose and relaxed for ten full breaths.


Begin by standing with your feet hip-distance apart and your knees relaxed. Don’t lock your knees during this stretch.
Slowly exhale as you bend forward from the hips. Imagine that your head is very heavy as you sink toward the floor and let your body hang down over your legs. (This is why it’s called the ragdoll pose.)
Clasp your hands around your elbows, as if you were forming a cradle. Don’t hold them too tightly, just enough to keep your arms off the floor.
Ensure that your weight is balanced evenly. Your instinct may be to center your body weight in your heels, but you should be firmly connecting with the floor with your whole foot.
Gently straighten your legs by using your quadriceps (the large muscles at the front of your thighs) to push your legs backward. Don’t lock your knees or force your legs to straighten past a comfortable point.
Take ten long, slow breaths while hanging, then gently return to standing.

, This position will stretch out your inner thighs.]


Begin by sitting on the floor with an upright, relaxed back. Your shoulders should be back, not rounded or hanging forward.
Bend one leg at the knee and bring your foot toward your body. Repeat with the other leg. Don’t force your legs farther than they will go comfortably. The soles of your feet should be facing each other.
Gently press your knees toward the floor and lean forward over your feet. You should feel some stretching in your groin and lower back, but stop if you feel discomfort. Hold the stretch for three long, slow breaths, then return to sitting.

, Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your toes slightly facing outward. Your knees should be relaxed, not locked. Slowly slide your legs apart until you can't go down any lower. Do not stretch any further than your body naturally allows you.


Hold this position for 30 seconds. (To help yourself stay balanced, lean over on your hands and use them to support part of your weight.)

, From the standing straddle, slowly bend your knees and lower your hips to the ground. You can support yourself with your hands.


Once sitting, stretch your arms in front of you and lean forward as far as you can. Your hands should touch the ground if possible.
Hold this stretch for 30 seconds. You will feel the stretch in your lower back and your inner thighs, but you should stop if you feel pain. Return to the sitting straddle position.

, Lean forward and stretch your arms toward your toes. If you can reach your toes, hold onto them. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds.

, Your back should be straight and your shoulders should be back, not slumped forward. Your legs should be straight, but your knees shouldn’t be hyperextended or locked.


To keep your knees from hyper-extending, you can hold a rolled towel between your thighs while you do the toe touch. The gripping action should keep you from pushing your knees too far back., Your palms should face forward. Pull your abdominal muscles in, but keep taking slow, deep breaths.

, Allow your weight to roll your body forward toward the ground. Reach your hands toward your toes.


You may find that you have to bend your legs slightly the first several times you do a toe touch. That’s okay. Each time you repeat your toe touch, try to bend your knees a little less.
Don’t lock or hyper-extend your knees as you bend forward. While your legs should be straight, your knees should feel flexible.

Bring both hands to your forward thigh, and lean your torso backward while extending that knee forward. Use these opposite motions to stretch out your quad.Hold for thirty seconds. Proceed with 5 to 10 repetitions on each leg.
Work the stretch even more by sliding the foot that's flat on the ground slightly outward and bringing both hands to the floor. Your arms and hands should be on the inner side of your leg and your knee should be in line with your shoulder.

Always warm up before stretching.,
Try to stretch after a full workout.,
Do dynamic stretching.,
Do static stretching.,
Try the contract-relax method.",How to Improve Flexibility1," The very first thing you must do before stretching is a warm up jog, run, or bike to get loose. You don't have to run or bike that hard or far, but it is good to do at least 20 minutes of warm up before stretching. This will prevent injury and strain.


If you are older or if you have limited mobility, you may not be biking or jogging. Try to do your stretching after some physical activity which has had you moving around for about 20 minutes, such as cleaning.;
, Try to do a full workout before stretching. This will ensure that your muscles are as warm and loose as possible, ensuring you get the most out of your stretching sessions.








, Dynamic stretching should always be done before static stretching. Dynamic stretching includes motion and is meant to mimic and exaggerate the movements of actual exercise and daily motions. This is a much safer form of stretching.








Do arm circles: Hold your arms out straight to either side, so that you form a T. Make circles with your arms. Do this twenty times before reversing the direction. As you become more flexible, you can make the circles bigger.Do Leg Swings: Bracing yourself against a wall, swing your outside leg up like a clock pendulum. Increase the height of the swing with each return. Switch sides to do the other leg. You can do a similar exercise with your arms.

Do Walking Lunges: Take the deep, exaggerate steps show in the linked article by essentially walking and nearly dropping to your knee with each step. You can add even more stretch by twisting your upper body away from the extended back leg with each movement.
Do Inchworms: If you are already somewhat flexible, you can try this exercise. Beginning in a pushup position, slowly walk until your feet are as close to your hands as you can get them. Once you’ve managed this, walk with your hands until you are back in the starting position. You can arch your back in order to add a spine stretch.

, Static stretching is the form of stretching that most people are familiar with from childhood gym classes. These are stretches done in a sitting or otherwise stationary position. These can increase flexibility but should only be done when working out is completed, as they present a large risk for injury to tight muscles.









Do a hamstring stretch: Either sit on the floor with legs extended or sit in a chair. Spread your legs apart. Reach forward to touch one foot at a time with your finger tips. You can also bend the leg which is not being reached if it makes the stretch less painful.
Do a butterfly groin stretch: Sit on the floor. Pull both ankles in towards your crotch, getting your heels as close as you can to touching your crotch. You can also press your knees to the floor to increase the stretch.
Try a tush push: If you cannot do the butterfly groin stretch, you might try a tush push instead. As you stand, keep your feet as wide as possible and hold onto the back of a chair. Push your tush to one side and hold. Then push it to the other side.
Do a shoulder stretch: Pull your elbow across the front of your body, towards the opposite shoulder, pressing against your arm as you do so.

, You can do this alone or assisted. Move into a stretch, then release for a moment and contract the muscles in the area. Release the contraction and relax the muscles while moving into the stretch again. You should be able to stretch a little farther with each repetition. If you have assistance, instruct the person to push your limb lightly into the stretch to help your muscle lengthen more.

Try Yoga.,
Try Pilates.,
Consider combining these with exercise and stretching.",How to Improve Flexibility2," Yoga is an Indian meditation technique and exercise which has been shown to reduce stress and anxiety (in turn aiding weight loss) and is excellent for building better balance and flexibility. Find a local group to practice with or take a class from a local gym or community center. You can also find lessons online or DVDs which will allow you to practice at home.

, Pilates is a series of movements and forms. Occasionally, tools like exercise balls, weights, and resistance bands can be used. It greatly improves balance and flexibility.

Get a massage.,
Use a hot tub or sauna.,
Consider acupuncture.",How to Improve Flexibility3," Deep muscle techniques like Neuromuscular, Rolfing, and Myofascial Release are designed to get rid of problems in your body that can reduce flexibility. Only go to a massage therapist who is trained in these modalities because injury could occur if the therapist doesn't know exactly what they are doing. A standard massage can help as well, since it will improve circulation to the muscles, allowing them to repair any damage.

, The heat of both of these environments can relax your muscles and aid flexibility. This should be used in conjunction with other methods, however, as it will do little on its own. Hot tubs and saunas are easily found at local fitness clubs and community pools.

, There is a small amount of evidence that acupuncture can help with flexibility.At any rate, it is well demonstrated to relieve muscle pain and improve blood flow, both of which can help flexibility exercise regimens.

",How to Get Your Leg Extension," You will need to stretch daily to achieve it and it will take time, but you can do it if you work hard enough.

, As this is aimed at beginners, not being able to do the splits is expected and you don't have to be able to do the splits fully to get a reasonable leg extension although it does help. The next few steps are going to be stretches and tips to achieve your splits. If you can already do them, skip the following steps
, Do some simple stretches to warm up. Stand up and touch your toes, legs together, and then stand up and touch the ground with your hands flat, legs shoulder length apart. Repeat this stretch sat down with your legs straight in front of you.
, The first of which is the butterfly stretch. Sit on the ground with your knees bent outward and your feet touching. Press your elbows down on your legs and you should feel a deep stretch in your thigh. The aim is to get your legs fully on the ground but it is not expected that you will be able to because it is a very hard and advanced stretch. Once you feel pain you should keep your legs where they are and do not move them any further as it could result in serious injury. This stretch loosens the muscle in your thigh which helps in the last part of this splits so do this any chance you get.
, Lunge forward with your front foot at an angle and your back knee to foot just above the ground. This also helps your splits greatly. Start doing these for ten seconds at a time and gradually move up to sixty.
, Find a piece of furniture at waist height. An extendable barre, meant for this exercise is good, but if you don't have once, sturdy furniture works just as well. Lift your leg up and place it on the furniture at waist height. This should be fairly easy as your leg is only waist high. Progress to gradually higher furniture but when you feel pain at a certain height, do not lift your leg onto furniture any higher. Keep working at the same height and eventually you will be able to lift it there without pain. Carry on like this with the ability to do the splits and you will get your leg extension with the furniture there holding it. Also be aware that it is possible to learn your splits whilst doing your leg extension so after practicing your leg extension, be sure to practice your splits to see how you have improved!
, You don't need to be able to just swing it up if you don't want to, holding your leg with your hand is just as impressive to see but if you want to, then below are stretches that will help your muscles.
, Lunges will really help so do as many as possible.
, Make sure to use your turnout muscles because quads can not go over 90 degrees. Soon you will be able to hold your leg above you head!

Try a beginner exercise.,
Do squats.,
Try walking squats.,
Do bridge exercises.,
Try donkey kicks.,
Practice lunges.,
Do a curtsy lunge.,
Try a jumping exercise.",How to Get a Tighter Butt1," Start with a simple exercise like the lateral step-up, for which you will need two 5 pound weights and a step bench (available at sports stores, department stores, and online). Stand with your right side to the bench, a weight in each hand, held in front of your thighs. Step up sideways onto the bench with your right foot and squeeze your glutes. Hold for a count of three, then step back down. Do this 15 times on each side, working up to three full sets., Position your legs so that they are a little wider than shoulder width, making sure your feet are angled slightly outwards. Lower your body downward as if you’re about to sit on a chair, shifting your weight towards your heels. Hold yourself in this position for 5 to 10 seconds, then lift yourself back up. Do two to three sets of 15 reps.To modify your squat workout, vary the duration of the exercise — for example, try lowering yourself into a squat more slowly over different intervals (e.g. lower your body into a squat within 2 seconds five times, then lower yourself for a full 5 seconds five times, and so on).

, Position your feet directly under your hips and lower your body into a squat. With your right foot, step out to the right as far as you can without your knee turning inward. Then step to the right with your left leg so that you are in the starting squat position with your feet under your hips. Keep your pelvis and body straight. Complete 10 steps, then do 10 steps to the left. Do three sets..

, Place an exercise mat on the ground; lie on your back, with your knees bent at shoulder-width. Thrust your hips upwards, lifting your butt until your torso is straight. Hold several seconds, then lower back down. Do three to five sets of 10 – 15 reps.Add weights to intensify this exercise. Hold weights at your groin to increase resistance.
Experiment with the height of your hip lift. You may find you access your glutes better with a low lift of only an inch or two above the mat.

, Also known as kick outs, these are fantastic for working your gluteal muscles. Start on your hands and knees on an exercise mat. Keep your hands under your shoulders and your knees under your hips. Kick back and up with your right leg, keeping your knee bent at a 90 degree angle. This should put your thigh, butt, and hip in a straight line with your torso. Keeping your leg bent, lower your knee, but do not touch the matt. Do 15 reps, then switch sides., Start standing with your feet together. With the right leg, take a big step backwards, lowering yourself slightly onto that leg. Return to your standing position. Repeat with the left leg, and do three sets of 10 – 15 reps., This exercise can give your butt a nice lift. Start out with your feet together. Step your right foot back and behind the left while simultaneously bending your right knee down so that you drop into a lunge position. It should look like you are doing a curtsy. Then push back up and step your foot back into the starting position. Do the same move using the left foot. Try doing three sets of 10 – 15 lunges with each foot.

, Try a lateral jump; stand turned with your right side 2 to 4 feet away from a step bench. Squat down slightly and hop onto the step sideways, landing on your right foot; bend your knees and hop back down, landing on your left foot. Continue back and forth 15 times, then switch sides and repeat. Do three sets of each.Jumping exercises are great for your glutes. Try double leg side to side jumps, standing broad jumps, jumping jacks, and box jumps.

Learn how to isolate your lats when flexing.,
Use a mirror for guidance.,
Flex your lats from the front.,
Do a back flex.",How to Flex Lats1," Your lats are muscles that run from your armpits to your hips. To figure out how to isolate your lats, cross your arms. Rest your fingers on your arms near your biceps. You will notice your lats activating naturally. When flexing your lats, try to make sure you're feeling the flex in this area., When flexing at home or at the gym, stand in a front of a mirror. A mirror can help you make sure you're mastering the moves correctly. Watch your body closely as you shift positions to ensure you're flexing correctly.


You can also have a friend take pictures while you flex, which you can later review.

, The front pose is a relaxed pose you can start with when flexing your lats. Press your feet firmly against the floor to stretch your upper quad. Pull your lats upward and flex them as widely as you can. Keep your arms relaxed and held at either sideAvoid flexing downward with your abs, as this can make your waist look blocky.

, Pull your feet back against the floor in a fashion that tightens your glues and hamstrings. While leaning backwards slightly, flare your lats as much as possible.When positioning your feet, this maneuver is similar to a stiff leg dead lift. You should move your feet to bend your knees and hips slightly, flexing your legs."
"
Sit on an exercise mat or soft, carpeted surface.,
Bend your knees out to the sides as though you were going to sit cross-legged.,
Place the bottoms of your feet together and bring them toward your groin, on the floor, as much as possible.

,
Sit up very straight and lean forward until you feel a stretch in the inner sides of your groin.

,
Hold the stretch for 30 to 60 seconds.",How to Gain Flexibility in Your Hips1," Make sure you are wearing loose-fitting or elastic clothing for these stretches.;
, The outside of your legs should be flush with the floor at all times.

,,, Rest for 30 seconds and repeat. Increase the duration of the stretch as you become more flexible and are able to bend further forward.


This exercise is especially helpful to anyone training to do side or front splits.

"
"
Take the stairs.,
Join an aerobics class.,
Go for a hike.",How to Get a Tighter Butt2," Opt to climb the stairs whenever possible (e.g. in lieu of taking an elevator at work every morning) to add butt-toning exercise to your day. For added benefit, try taking two stairs at a time. Try using a stair climber machine at the gym, which is a good way to get a full stair-climbing workout., Aerobics classes are a great way to maintain a regular exercise schedule and stay motivated about your workout. While any exercise classes will work towards tightening your butt in the long run, some have more immediate benefits. Spin classes, for example, offer an intensive workout focused on the lower body.You can also look for classes specifically geared towards butt workouts (e.g. “Booty Kickin’ Step” at Crunch gym in New York City).

, Hiking is an excellent workout — just one hour of moderately strenuous to vigorous hiking burns over 400 calories, toning your legs and butt in the process. When weather permits, look online for hiking trails near you, preferably on hilly terrain for an added challenge to your workout; plot out your route carefully, and be sure to bring a friend with you for safety. Wear sturdy shoes with thick, rubber soles to prevent falls and protect your feet.Bring water, snacks, your cell phone, a first-aid kit, a map, and a light jacket or umbrella in case of rain.

Hydrate as much as possible.,
Eat foods that stimulate collagen production.,
Cut down on salt.",How to Get a Tighter Butt3," Staying hydrated can keep your skin firm and reduce the appearance of cellulite. Drink as much water as you can during the day and opt for water-rich foods such as watermelon, cucumber, carrots, lettuce, zucchini, and watercress., Collagen is the main structural protein found in skin, and its production is necessary for firm, youthful, smooth skin. To tighten skin (and your butt), eat foods that prevent the breakdown of collagen and stimulate its growth in the body. Some of these foods include:Sunflower seeds
Chilis
Blueberries
Oily fish, such as trout
Olive oil
Dark chocolate

, Excessive salt can cause the body to retain water, which can make cellulite appear worse. Stay away from processed foods, which are generally high in sodium, and be vigilant about reading nutrition information on product packaging. Note that products like soda, snack cakes, and deli meats are all deceptively high in salt."
"
Spread your lats during a front pose.,
Show off your lats in a double bicep pose.,
Spread your lats in a rear lat pose.",How to Flex Lats2," Start in the same basic position as the relaxed front pose you engaged in earlier. Make fists with your hands. Then, place your fists on the widest part of your hips. Flare your lats while leaning back slightly.You can also flex your pecs and arms while engaging in this pose.

, Turn around and bend one of your legs slightly to flex your calf. Turn your leg to the side slightly. Hold your arms above your head, bending them at the elbow in a traditional flexing pose. Flex your lats as you lean backwards.Be aware of your shoulders during this pose. It's important not to squish your shoulder blades together.

, Keep your feet in the same position they were in for the double bicep pose. Locate the thickest part of your obliques. Place your fists against this part of your oblique muscles. Then, lean back slightly while you spread your lats outward.Make sure you're spreading your lats only and not your back. Try to keep your back from flexing or stretching while you engage in this pose.

"
"
Enlist the help of a trainer.,
Stop if a pose causes pain.,
Practice flexing regularly.,
Make sure you're actually flexing your lats.",How to Flex Lats3," It can be hard to utilize your lats, especially if you're new to flexing. Seek out the help of a professional trainer. If your gym provides trainers to members, take advantage of this. You can also look up trainers online.

, There's always a risk of injury if you're engaging in new workouts, flexes, or poses. If you feel strain at any point, stop what you're doing. Flexing past the point of pain can cause injury.

, Flexing gets easier with practice. Each day, between sets during workouts or weight lifting, practice your flexing.While you can practice flexing every day, be aware you should not weight lift every day. Always take breaks between days that you weight train.

, When you first start flexing your lats, you may inadvertently stretch or flex the wrong muscles. Make sure you flex your lats and not areas like your back, shoulder blades, or arms.If you get confused during a flex, stop and cross your arms like you did to originally locate your lat muscles. This will remind you which muscles to flex while flexing your lats.

Determine the size of the geocache container you wish to make.,
Become familiar with standard sizes for geocache containers.,
Think about the cache location.,
Choose or construct a geocache container.,
Mark your geocache container with the words ""official geocache"" if you desire.,
Fill your geocache container.,
Place your geocache container at your chosen site.

,
Log its placement on a geocaching website so others can find it.

",How to Make a Geocache Container," It should be water and dirt-proof.


The items you have decided to place in the geocache container will help determine its size and shape. If you only wish to place a small log book in your container, you can make a nano container. If you wish to fill your geocache container with items to be traded, you will need a larger container.;
,


A nano geocache container holds less than 10 ml (.34 fl. oz.)
A micro geocache container holds less than 100 ml (3.4 fl. oz.)
A small geocache container holds between 100 ml (3.4 fl. oz.) and 1 L (34 fl. oz)
A regular geocache container holds between 1 L (34 fl. oz.) and 20 L (676 fl. oz.)
A large geocache container holds 20 L (676 fl. oz.) or more.

, This includes the terrain and mental difficulty.


Larger geocache containers are usually easier to find than smaller containers.
Brighter geocache containers are usually easier to find than ones that blend in with their surroundings.

,


Film canisters, plastic containers, ammunition boxes, buckets and even birdhouses are often used as geocache containers, but anything watertight can work.
Make sure that the geocache container you choose or construct is watertight and can withstand the wind and weather of your region.
You should consider placing the contents of your geocache within a zippered plastic bag in case the container leaks or someone does not shut it properly.






You may wish to place a string or magnet on your geocache container to fix it in place at your site.

, Never use stickers, they can rot away. Using spray paint and stencils are recommended.

,


All geocaches should contain a logbook If there is room, a writing implement, preferably a soft lead pencil should also be included.






Common items to place in a geocache container include inexpensive children's toys, a disposable camera that people can take their pictures with and return to the cache for you to develop later, and pre-addressed postcards that people who find the cache can send to you.






Each item should be placed in a zippered plastic bag.

Watch weather reports.,
Find parking coordinates.,
Dress properly.,
Stay on the trails as much as possible.,
Do a 360° search of ground zero.,
Enjoy the surroundings.",How to Geocache in the Forest," Nothing is more depressing than trying to find a geocache in the pouring rain. Dirt automatically turns into mud, trees and branches are always dripping with water, and wet trails may be harder to walk on. Sunny days usually make people more happy and energized to hike and scout for caches.;
, Most forest and parks will have some kind of a parking area. If necessary, set a way point as soon as you leave your vehicle. Locate an information center or a forest kiosk and get a map if you're new to the area. You can always visit an official website and print a map from there as well.

, Loose comfortable clothing or anything you are willing to get dirty, wet, and possibly muddy. During the winter, be sure to dress warm enough to be out for at least 1-2 hours. Hiking boots are very recommended, as sneakers can easily be soaked while crossing streams, swamps, or climbing different types of terrain. The sturdier the sole is, the better. Always carry a portable or small bug or mosquito spray with you. Apply some on before heading into the forest.

, Some cache hiders will advise others to stick to the trails until the last 5 to 20 feet (1.5 to 6.1 m) to find the cache. If there are no hints or advise, use your judgment depending on the latitude and longitude between where you stand and how far away the cache coordinates are. If you see another trail off the main one, try a ""trial and error"" by following the secondary trail to see if it helps.

, Use creativity to think of where the cache may be hidden or ask yourself if anything looks ""out of place"", as other items may be helping to cover it. Some caches may be hidden in logs or in trees.

, You've come out to find the cache, why not take a breath to enjoy the view? Take pictures of the wildlife, nature, or animals that you encounter on your trip.

Log your find on the geocache webpage.,





Look at the Travel Bug list on the page.,





Click on the drop down menu for ""Type of Log"".,





Write a note on the page.,
Place it in a different cache.,
Create a new log for that cache.",How to Use a Geocaching Travel Bug or Geocoin on Geocaching.com," Be sure to add a note in your summary that you have taken or traded the bug or coin, so people know who took it and when.
, Find the specific one that you have and click on the link. This will bring you to the official page of the bug or coin., Look at the different options and select the correct one for you:

Retrieve from _____: You have found the geocache in the same cache that the previous person dropped it in.
Grab it from somewhere else: You've found the bug/coin in a different cache than listed.
Write note: Notes can very much assist people whom are looking for it, especially the owner. This helps on the condition and whereabouts of it.
Discovered it: If you come across it in a cache, but you don't take it, you can ""log"" it on its page, noting that it's there. It's a controversy on whether or not to use this, as some people only log if they decide to take it and others log its ""existence"" for the purpose.

, Inform people about your discovery or plans on travelling it to a different cache., Whether you find a new cache on the way or want to revisit one that you've already logged, make sure that it fits properly in it., If you've already visited it, make a note. If it's your first time there, make a ""Found It"" log. You don't need to specify the actual name of the coin or bug - as you can simple say, ""Dropped TB"" or ""Took ___, Left coin""."

Identify the muggles.,
Try not to draw attention to yourself.,
Come back later.,
Make Geocaching look as natural as possible.,
Be prepared to answer their questions.",How to Deal With Geocaching Muggles," There are four basic types of muggles, and some pose more of a threat than others. These types are:



The Oblivious Muggle: Muggles that are just going about their daily life and will pay you and the Geocache no attention.

The Lingerer: This muggle is going about their daily life and doesn't care about Geocaching, but they will linger in the spot right near the Geocache for long periods of time.

The Semi-Curious Muggle: Muggles whose curiosity is aroused when they see you Geocaching. Be prepared for them to come over and ask you what you're doing.

The Whistle Blower: These are the most dangerous type of muggles, as they will come over and pester you about what you're doing or call the police on you because of your 'suspicious' actions. They may also come over and attempt to find the Geocache after you've left.;
, Avoid suspicious actions, such as constantly looking over your shoulder, or huddling over your GPS in heavily populated areas. These actions will draw attention to yourself, and a muggle is bound to either call the police or ask you what you're doing.

, If there are too many people around, or there are a few ""lingerers"" in the area, leave and come back later. Go get a coffee or go home for a couple hours, and then come back at a time where the area would be less populated so you can search for the Geocache then.

, If you need to dig around in the dirt, drop something and dig through the dirt to pick it up. If a muggle is approaching, put your GPS to your ear and pretend that it's a cell phone.

, If a muggle comes over and asks you what you're doing, just admit that you're Geocaching. If they're interested, explain to them what Geocaching is, and tell them to look up the Geocaching online.

"
"
Please don't use geocaching abbreviation-only and ""lingo""-only logs.,
Be precise about geocoins and trackables.,
Treat the cache as your own and log down any conditions.,
Take the time out to record in detail any experiences encountered on your journey.,
Avoid leaving any clues.,
Take pictures around the area, never of the actual cache position.",How to Have Geocaching Log Etiquette1," After writing a meaningful sentence or two, you could end your log with one of the common acronyms but don't make it the only thing in your log.:


TFTC = Thanks For The Cache
TFTH = Thanks For The Hike
TNLN = Took Nothing, Left Nothing
SL = Signed Log.;
,


Always note in both the trackable and cache log if anything is missing. This way, the trackable owner will be notified where it went missing and who the last person to hold it was - as well as notifying anyone who searches for the cache.
Write down any trackables that you take or leave, despite it appearing/disappearing in the trackable list. A lot of trackables have travel missions, so it's always interesting to read if something goes to another country or overseas.

, Whether the log is damp/wet, almost filled with signatures, or missing, notify the owner immediately. In such an emergency, you can use a notification icon pertaining to the situation. If you can, take a photo of the cache condition to post with your 'needs maintenance' log. Don't wait for a cache logbook (log sheet) to become completely full before reporting it. Note the almost full log in your online log.

, Every cache is placed in a different environment. Any muggle obstacles? Wildlife? Hiking experiences? How easy or hard was it to complete the puzzle? Did you take anyone with you?

, The entire concept of geocaching is like ""finding the treasure at the end of a rainbow."" Don't spoil it for other people by describing the immediate area (or ""ground zero""). If you have the need to, always cipher (encode) that section of your log.

, Autumn foliage, snow cover, animals nearby, historical statues, and other interesting sights can enhance your online log for others to enjoy.

Make a fist.,
Extend and tense your arm.,
Bend your elbow slowly to tighten your bicep.",How to Flex1," Form the hand of the arm your want to flex into a tight fist. The simple action of forming a fist already begins to tighten your muscles. It's impossible to fully flex your arms if you don't make a fist first., Straighten your arm either downward or out to the side. This lets the arm start at its most expanded state. Starting with a straight arm and a fist gives you the best ending result.

, Raise your hand upward and bend your elbow. Go slowly so the tension builds through your muscle as it tightens. Focus your energy into tightening the muscles in the arms. Hold the position to showcase your muscles. Don't hold a flex for too long before you release it.

"
"
Realize the size of the cache.,
Know the limitations of a nano/micro cache:


Realize the number of dates and nicknames is great and there will be many more.,
Leave a thankful note and small summary on a larger notepad.,
Use geocaching abbreviations and ""lingo"" for quick appreciation.",How to Have Geocaching Log Etiquette2," The smaller the cache, the smaller your log must be.

, It is best to leave the shortest identifier possible and always leave room for other people!
Be sure to double check the owner requests on the online log to see if a nickname or initials is sufficient.
Securely and tightly roll the paper log back up. Always be sure to place it in the lid or cap of the cache before twisting the cache closed upside down. When it's placed in the body of the container, it unravels and expands back out. This makes it harder to close properly, as well making it harder to open for the next person.

, Tell what you saw or who you brought along for the trip.

, Some cache owners love to keep old logs as souvenirs, so show your appreciation on paper as well!

Use dumbbells or barbells to build your biceps.,
Start the lift with your arms hanging at your sides.,
Bend your elbow and raise the weights to the level of your chin.,
Tense the bicep muscle while the weight is up.,
Lower the weights slowly.",How to Flex2," Choose whichever type of weight is available to you and you are most comfortable with. Use dumbbells to work each arm on its own, or use barbells to work both arms at the same time. Each has its benefits and limitations.Dumbbells give your arms a broader range of motion because the arms move separately, while barbells require your hands to remain in one position.
A drawback to dumbbells is that you risk one arm doing more work than the other arm, which will grow your muscles unevenly.

, Grab weights that you can lift. As you perform the lift, keep your elbows pressed tight to your sides. If you feel them starting to drift forward to rest on your hips, resist that feeling.


Drifting your elbows to the front of your body lets other muscles assist with the lift, which takes focus from the biceps.

, Perform the lift slowly, using only your biceps to lift the weights. Keep your back straight and don’t rock as you lift. Don't arch your back or you’ll engage other muscles, which reduces the strengthening of your biceps.If you can’t get the weights up to the level of your chin, you need to carefully set the weights down and use lighter ones.
If you have not lifted much before, it may take a few tries to find the weights that are right for you.
As you are lifting, the main thing is to focus your energy solely on your biceps. Using any other muscles to assist in the lift reduces the effectiveness.

, Push your biceps further by tightening your bicep muscles while your elbows are bent. This extra tensing of the muscle increases the strengthening of the muscle with each rep that you do., After you’ve completed the curl and tensed your biceps, slowly extend your elbows so the weights hang down where they began. Lowering the weights slowly is the most important part because it affects the strengthening of the biceps.


It takes more work to lower them slowly than it does to let them fall, so slow is the most effective option.

Hit each section of abdominal muscles.,
Perform the bicycle crunch to work your lower abs.,
Perform V-ups to work your upper abs.,
Perform Russian twists to work your obliques.,
Work out your abs consistently.,
Reduce the number of calories you take in.",How to Flex3," Your abs have three main sections: the upper abdominal, lower abdominal, and the obliques. Make sure that when you are doing ab exercises you specifically target each of these parts of muscle group. Each part adds to the overall look of your abs.There are many ab exercises that target each part of your abs, so do some research to find exercises that you feel the most comfortable with.

, Lay flat on your back with your legs straight and your hands behind your head. Bend one knee and lift the opposite elbow up to touch the knee. Repeat with the other leg and arm.The number of reps that you do is up to you. Start with a low number of reps and work your way up to more reps.

, Lay flat on your back with your legs out straight on the floor and your arms extended overhead on the floor. Slowly raise your legs and arms at the same time until they are in a “V” shape. Hold it for one second, then slowly lower your arms and legs back down.This may be difficult for you if you have not done a lot of abdominal work before. Perform only as many reps as you feel comfortable with.

, Sit on the floor with your knees bent and your upper body almost straight up. Hold a medicine ball or a weight, or don’t use a weight at all but lock your hands in front of you. Twist slowly to the left as far as you can and hold the position for one second. Then twist to the right as far as you can and hold it.Repeat this motion for the desired number of reps.
You’ll get a harder workout with a weight, but this is a good exercise for you if you have not done many ab exercises before.

, Don’t expect to do one day of abs each week and make significant progress. You also can’t do three hard days in a row and then take two weeks off. Get on a routine that works for you and stick to it. It’s good to do an ab routine three non-consecutive days a week., If you want to see your abs, you need to lose spare fat that’s stored on your body. Doing lots of ab exercises will not help if you don’t reduce your calorie intake. Commit to an eating plan that reduces your overall intake. Defining your abs starts with your diet.You don’t have to join a specific diet program like South Beach or Weight Watchers, although these can help. All you need to do is evaluate how much you are eating and work to consistently reduce the amount.
Besides quantity of food, this also deals with quality. Reduce the fat, sugar, and overall calorie count of your daily food intake.

Move your hands closer together when you do push ups.,
Do a high number of reps with lower weight on bench press.,
Rest your muscles so that they grow.",How to Flex4," Place your hands so that they are almost touching forefingers and thumbs in a diamond shape. Lower yourself slowly and engage the pecs when you push up.Standard push ups place your hands about shoulder width apart, but moving the hands closer together targets your pectoral muscles, as well as your triceps.

, Muscle is built over time with multiple reps, not by busting out the highest weight possible on one rep. It’s okay to push for a high max once in awhile, but don’t forget that reps are what build your pec muscles., Exercising your muscles is sort of like tearing them, while resting gives them a chance to repair. Do pectoral exercises twice a week, a few days apart, and let them rest and grow on the other days. Flex and stretch them on the days where you are not doing exercises."

Certain models have the capability of ""paperless geocaching"" described in the Tips section, below.;
, Some sites offer completely free access to the caching data and all site features, but some sites offer ""premium"" member status to access certain features. There are caches on several different sites, so explore them and decide which you prefer.

, Geocaches are hidden everywhere, so wherever you are, there are sure to be some for you to find.

, Record any details or hints on a notepad or by printing the page out. Be sure to check the difficulty rating. You may not want to search for a cache that's too difficult if you are just starting out.

, You may also be able to transfer the cache's coordinates to your GPS using the supplies connection cable if you have the correct software.

, Caches come in all shapes, sizes, and colors; so be on the lookout.Take note of the precise way the geocache has been hidden once you find the cache. You will need to replace it in an identical fashion. But remember, geocaches are never hidden underground!

, Consider if you would like to take anything in exchange for the cache item you have brought along with you. You should always trade something of equal or greater value to keep the sport fair and honest. You are not required to make a trade if you don't want to. Alternatively, you can help ""restock"" a poorly filled cache by leaving your item and taking nothing.

, Make a new entry in the book noting the date and your caching site username. If the logbook is particularly small, as in a micro or nano cache, sign only your initials.

, Close the cache securely and hide it in the exact same place and manner in which you found it for the next person.

, Find your chosen cache once again and use the ""Log Your Visit"" feature (or equivalent) to record that you found the cache. Include the same kinds of details that you wrote in the cache logbook.

Return the cache.",How to Maintain a Geocache,", Many geocaching websites have a special marker indicating if the geocache needs repair. If not, you can check the log to see if the cache is damaged or waterlogged, and make accommodations., Often, a damaged cache will not be in the location it started, so it may require some searching. Once the cache is found, take it someplace dry, and if necessary, wipe off dirt and water., Make sure there isn't and cracks or leaks in the cache. If there is, apply duct tape., Geocaches should always be labeled so that they are not mistaken for trash. For smaller caches, use a waterproof sticker that says something along the lines of, ""Official geocache, do not remove!"". If the cache is large enough though, you can use your stencil to spray paint the outside. It is recommended to use a geocache specific stencil, but letter stencils can also be used., Make sure there is, at a minimum, a log. If the log is full, take a picture of it, and replace it. Make sure to email the owner the photo, or put the photo on a geocaching website. If the cache is missing them, put in a geocaching info note and a pencil., Once all the necessary improvements are in place, use your GPS to navigate to the exact coordinates, then use the cache description to place it in the right position."

Maintain your cache.",How to Create and Hide a Geocache," Try to find a variety of cache types and sizes in various terrains and locations and covering the spectrum of difficulty levels. This will allow you to determine which things work well and help you form wise choices in this endeavor.



Some people will advise you to find X number of caches, but if they are mostly of one type, it won't be helpful. You'll learn more finding ten caches of ten different types than one hundred caches of a similar type. It is helpful to gain a little experience first.;
, A quality geocache will be hidden near something of natural, human, historic, or scenic interest or at least at the end of a pleasant walk. Try to make it a place that people would enjoy visiting even if the cache wasn't there.

, If it is private property, obtain permission from the land owner. Some park systems require permits and some do not allow geocaching, so check with park management to make sure geocaching is allowed, then obtain a permit if required.

, Geocache containers should be waterproof and durable. Military surplus ammo boxes are a favorite of many geocachers. Also make sure the container is appropriate for the area (see Tips, below). A good seal is important, because, if water leaks in, the cache will be ruined.

, This is optional but will help keep non-geocachers from finding it. Painting it in colors which match the area or wrapping it in camouflage duct tape are two ways that will help conceal it. Other methods include gluing bark to the container or hiding it under fake rocks or tree stumps.

, In today's world, suspicious packages can create alarm. Clearly labeling your container as a geocache and with the proper contact information may reduce the chances of your cache being reported as suspicious package.

, Include a letter explaining what it is, just in case a non-geocacher finds it. Also include a logbook, pencil, and, if the geocache is large enough, trinkets for finders to trade out.

, Your cache is more likely to last if you choose a low traffic area where it is not likely to accidentally be discovered and where searchers won't be spotted by passersby, business owners, security guards, or residents.

, Make sure you have a good satellite signal, then let your GPS settle at the cache site for a minute or two before marking. Check your owners' manual for the section on how to mark a waypoint if you don't yet know.

, You need to post it on a website so other geocachers can obtain the coordinates. The most popular site, by far, is www.geocaching.com. Other sites include www.navicache.com, www.terracaching.com, opecaching.com and www.opencaching.us.

, Be ready to respond promptly to reported problems such as missing containers and wet or full logbooks. If you lose interest, remove your cache and archive the listing.

Most health experts will say to skip the diet and make small lifestyle changes. These are easier to make and keep up long-term.;
, Unfortunately, there is no way to lose fat from one region of the body only. If you want to get rid of your love handles, you will have to lose overall body weight by reducing the amount of calories you consume on a daily basis.Calculate the amount of calories you eat in a day by reading food labels and keeping a food journal. There are also plenty of free online calorie counters/calculators available that help you keep track of your calories and look up the calorie content of various foods.
If your goal is to drop the weight quickly, then reduce your intake by 500-750 calories each day. Eating within this range can help you lose 1-2 pounds per week when coupled with regular exercise.Though anything under 1200 calories is not sustainable in the long run and is not recommended. Very low calorie diets may result in nutrient deficiencies long-term.

, Your diet should be composed primarily of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. A balanced diet including all of these food groups will help make sure you're consuming adequate amounts of each nutrient daily.Also consume a wide variety of foods. For example, don't just choose to eat an apple a day. Alternate between apples, berries or oranges.
A balanced diet also means that you're consuming appropriate portion sizes of each foods. Following the right portion size can also help you lose weight., This combination of foods helps you lose weight, but specifically the body fat stored around your stomach.Many studies have shown that a lower carb, higher protein diet helps you lose the fat store in and around your abdominal organs.This eating pattern can really target the fat found in love handles.
To get in enough protein, aim to have a 3-4 oz serving at each meal and a 1-2 oz serving at each snack.This will help you meet your daily needs.
Fill the rest of your meals with a fruit or a vegetable. Some health professionals recommend eating 5-9 servings daily while others suggest making half of your plate a fruit or vegetable., If you're focusing mostly on protein, fruits and vegetables, you'll want to minimize the amount of carbs you eat each day. This will help promote speedy weight loss from your love handles.Carbs are found in a wide variety of foods including: dairy products, grains, starchy vegetables, fruit and legumes.
Don't cut out carbs completely. Minimizing starchy vegetables and grains is an easy way to follow a low-carb diet. Many of the nutrients found in these food groups can be found in other foods as well.
Limit yourself to 1-2 servings of carbohydrate rich foods daily. Make the rest of your food choices a lean protein or vegetable.

, Many highly processed foods or junk foods are higher in calories.Limiting these foods can help aid in overall weight loss and the loss of unwanted love handles.


The best way to avoid eating unhealthy foods is to not keep junk food around the house. If you buy healthy foods, then you will eat healthy foods.
Cook your own meals at home when possible, as most restaurant foods are slathered with butter, sugar and oil. When cooking at home, ditch the butter and use olive oil or cooking sprays instead.
When ordering out, cut down on calories by asking for the dressing/sauce on the side, and choose protein-rich foods over pizza and pasta.

, Maintaining adequate hydration is important to your overall health. However, drinking enough water each day can also help support your weight loss.When you're trying to reduce your body fat and lose weight, drinking adequate water can help you feel full and more satisfied throughout the day.Aim for at least 8 glasses daily, but you may even need up to 13 depending on your age, gender and activity level.To help curb hunger and speed weight loss, try drinking a full glass of water before meals and snacks. This can help you feel fuller faster and may help you eat less overall.

, Plan out healthy snacks like carrots, celery, apples, and yogurt for in between meals. Higher calorie snacks may prevent you from losing weight or even cause weight gain.Most snacks should be around 100-150 calories if you're trying to lose weight.Also, only snack if you're truly hungry or there's more than 4-6 hours between meals.
For many people, weight gain has nothing to do with what they eat during their meals, but rather, what they eat in between their meals. Get out of the habit of snacking on foods mindlessly while standing in front of the refrigerator or rummaging in the cupboard.
Avoid late-night snacking by drinking tea or chewing on gum at night, and set a time for yourself, like 7:00 pm or 8:00 pm, after which you cannot eat anymore food.

, One exercise that helps tone your stomach, but particularly your love handles or obliques are bicycle crunches.To do this exercise:









Lay flat on your back with your hands behind your head. Raise your legs so that they are 1–2 feet (0.3–0.6 m) above the ground.
Bend your left knee and bring it toward your head and twist your body so that your right elbow meets your left knee.
Now, straighten your left leg and do the same thing on the other side, touching your right knee to your left elbow.
Do 15-20 of these for one rep, increasing reps as you get stronger.

, This twisting exercise may be slightly easier to do that traditional crunches, yet it focuses on strengthening your love handles and obliques.To do this exercise:









Sit on the ground with your back straight and your feet extended out in front of you. Bend your knees slightly and keep your feet flat on the floor.
Bend backward slightly so that your back is at a little less than 90 degrees. Hold a 5-10 pound dumbbell in your hands and twist your body toward the left, lowering the dumbbell halfway to the floor.
Bring your body back to the original position, and then do the same thing on the right side. Repeat 20-25 times.

, The plank exercise is a great move to help tone your entire core, but making modifications to make it a side plank specifically targets your obliques.To do this exercise:









Start off in a side plank position with your right elbow supporting you, and your left arm resting on your hips. Make sure that your body is totally straight, and hold the position for 30-60 seconds.
Repeat on the other side with your left elbow supporting you. You can flip flop a few times between sides.

, Yoga and pilates help tone up your entire body, and produce long, lean muscles. These types of exercises are perfect for those who do not want to get ""bulky.""









Join a yoga studio, or sign up for total-body toning classes at your gym if you are a member.
Try online yoga videos or DVDs. These may be cheaper than going to a yoga studio or paying for a gym membership.

, Getting enough cardiovascular exercise not only improves your overall health but helps burn calories and reduce your overall body fat.








There are a variety of exercises that you can do. Try jogging, walking uphill, hiking, biking, dancing, and kickboxing.
You should get at least 30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise 5 times per week to maintain your overall health and lose weight.If you don't have enough time to do a formal exercise, then try to incorporate more activity into your daily life. Walk to your destination rather than driving, do chores around the house, go window shopping, and so on.

, To help see how far you've come, it's a good idea to track your measurements. This will help see how much fat you've lost from your hips or stomach.


Use a tape measure to measure around the smallest part of your waist, the lower part of your waist (2 inches below your belly button) and your hips.
Measurements can help you keep track of your progress, and are more helpful than numbers on the scale, since muscle weighs more than fat.
Don't forget to take an initial measurement so you have a starting point to use.

, Losing your love handles means losing extra fat, and in turn, overall body weight. Regular check-ins with the scale may also help you keep off your body fat long-term.Weigh yourself 1-2 times per week in the morning before you have eaten anything. Remember that clothes and shoes weigh something too, so weigh yourself naked or in just your underwear.
Keep track of your weight so you can measure your progress. If you gain weight or lose too much you'll be able to pick up on the trend more quickly if you're tracking.

, Studies have shown that people who keep track of the food they eat by writing it down lose more weight than people who don't.Food journals help you stay organized, and hold you accountable for the decisions you make so that you are more conscious of your choices.Choose either a pen and pencil style journal or consider downloading an app on your smart phone.
Track all meals, snacks and beverages. This can be helpful information if you notice a weight gain or unwanted weight loss. You can see what food choices may have led to those changes.

, Losing weight with somebody else can be a major source of inspiration. Studies show that those people who had support were more successful with weight loss.Work out together to make exercising more fun, and keep each other motivated when one of you feels like giving up.
Ask friends, family members or coworkers to support you or ask them to join you on your new diet and exercise program.

Figure out your measurements.,
Make a trip to the hardware store.,
Alternatively, use a hacksaw instead of a pipe cutter.",How to Make a Hula Hoop1," To determine the exact length of irrigation tubing you need to construct your hula hoop, stand up straight and measure the distance from your feet to your chest (or anywhere between your belly button and your chest). This measurement is the diameter of your ideal beginner hoop if you have a normal BMI. If you are overweight or obese you can calculate your ideal hoop size by multiplying your waist in inches by (1.2). (39""x1.2=45"" hoop). You then need to calculate its circumference to know how much tubing you need. (circumference = pi (π=3.14) times the diameter: c=πd).


The average diameter of an adult hula hoop is 40”, so the circumference is 40 x 3.14 = 126”.
The average diameter of a child’s hula hoop is 28” making the circumference about 28 x 3.14 = 88”. ;
, You'll need three things, all of which can be found in the plumbing section:


¾"" (19mm) 160 psi for a weighted hoop, 100 psi for a medium weight hoop (or any other pressure rating) irrigation tubing
A PVC pipe cutter
One ¾"" (19mm) barbed coupling plastic pipe fitting
If you don't want to buy a PVC pipe cutter, you can use regular scissors. However, scissors require more effort to cut the PVC pipe.

, If you have one already and you are handy with it, a hacksaw is another option – you just may need to debar any sharp ridges using sandpaper or a utility knife.


In which case, you'll need sandpaper or a power sander. If you use a power sander, you'll need goggles to protect your eyes. As you can see, a pipe cutter is the easier way to go.

Repeat each week.",How to Make an Exercise Schedule," In order to locate pockets of time for each upcoming week, get your calendar out; you won't need more than 15 minutes to organize your schedule. To keep yourself reminded of the time you've designated, make sure this information is available on the calendar you're most likely to look at daily.


Your calendar preference might be your Google calendar, your personal calendar on your phone, or the good old paper version. Other suitable forms to plan a weekly schedule include using a PDA, day planner, or spreadsheet.;
, Fill in everything you can think of that requires your time.


Do you or someone in your family have a dentist appointment? An appointment with a hairstylist? A project to complete?
Record it all.

, This is where you'll schedule your daily workout routines.


Highlight your open windows of time. Identify varying time slots in order to tailor your workouts to the available time you have. The more time you have, the better. No matter what time slots you have, there are resources available to fit your lifestyle:

60 minutes or more?
50 minutes
40 minutes
30 minutes
20 minutes
10 minutes



, Many people find cardiovascular exercise a daunting task because they try to get in way too much cardio. That's right – too much! To achieve most fitness goals, you'll want to do 20 to 30 minutes of cardio three times per week at your target heart rate. This means that you can get yourself changed, sneakers on, and complete your cardio workout in a total of 30 to 40 minutes!


Be sure to pick something you're willing to do. Without choosing what you enjoy doing, you can have a hard time getting motivated to do cardio.
Write down ""cardiovascular exercise"" in time slots that give you 30 to 40 minutes of free time. Go ahead, fill in 3 of these slots:

If your knees bother you, choose a stationary bike, an elliptical machine, or go for a swim.
Is a brisk walk or run in your neighborhood appealing?
How about those stairs at the office? Walk up and down for the allotted time.
Do you prefer a class at a local club or town hall?
A video in your living room?
Don't know what you like? Try some different options and find what you are most likely to stick with.



, Taking that first step is often the toughest. Make yourself accountable by signing up for a personal training session or partnering with a friend. 30 to 40 minutes of strength training is optimal; however, you can fit some exercises in as little as 10 minutes if you're prepared to optimize those short bursts of free time.


Have a set of dumbbells ready to go under your desk.
Throw some tubing or bands in a desk drawer for easy access.
Bookmark some interesting workouts on YouTube.

, If you do choose ten minute blocks, be sure to fit three of these short workouts in on one day.

,


Have you fit in 3 sessions of cardiovascular exercise for 30 minutes each in your week?
How did you do with strength training? Have you scheduled at least three sessions of 30 minutes?

, Following through with your exercise plan will give you a sense of accomplishment. You can tweak your routine next week if necessary.


When you've completed each workout, check it off on your calendar, PDA, cell phone, etc.
Notice what works for you and what doesn't so you can make changes when planning day comes around again.

, By sticking with a planning day and creating a schedule each week, you're more likely to stick with your plan and reach your goals.


At the end of each week, note what worked and what needs to be changed.
If your plan worked well for you this week, repeat. If not, make the necessary changes.

Cut the irrigation tubing.,
Soften one end of the tubing.,
Place the coupling into the softened end of the tubing.,
If you’d like, place “weights"" or sound makers into the hula hoop.,
Dip the other end of the tubing into the boiling water.,
When ready, couple the newly softened end onto the end with the PVC connector.,
Decorate the hula hoop.",How to Make a Hula Hoop2," Use the pipe cutter, hacksaw, or scissors to cut the tubing to your desired length. It will take a bit of effort to cut through, so take your time and be careful.

, Boil a large pot of water and insert one end of the tubing into the water for 30 seconds. The end of the tubing should be soft and pliable prior to fastening to the other end of the tubing.


If that’s not handy, you can use a blow dryer; however, this may take longer and involves the dryer being held up the entire time. Usually, just having a pot of boiling water available is easiest.
After heating, work quickly while the tubing is still warm and pliable.

, Push down hard on the connector to ensure a solid joint. The two should fit snugly, with the connector going nowhere.


Be careful not to push the connector too far down into the tubing. The other end of the tubing will need to fasten to it. It should stick out about halfway.

, If this is for a child or for exercise purposes, having something inside the tubing can make hula hooping even more enjoyable (or more of a workout). Here are some ideas:


Small beans (about 20-30)
Corn kernels
Water (a cup or so)
Sand
Rice

, If you have objects inside the tubing, manage it carefully so it doesn’t come spilling out the other end. This part should only take a few minutes.

, Just like you did in the steps above, seal the tubing into a hoop shape by connecting the last two exposed ends.


Again, work quickly. The tubing is more pliable the warmer it is. As it cools, it will contract and form a strong seal, keeping the hoop together.

, Add some personal flare, such as glittered tape, paint or any other enhancements you’d like. It can be drawn on with permanent or special craft markers, too.


You can easily make candy-cane like, traditional hula hoop stripes with colored electrical tape. It’s smoother than duct tape and blends into the texture of the tubing better.

"
"
Get your materials together.,
Measure how much tubing you need and cut it into four equal pieces.,
Make unique markings on each end.,
Put on your goggles and start sanding the ribs off of one end of each of the connectors.,
Heat one end of each quarter of tubing.,
Using your markings, fit the hoop together.,
Insert the bungee cord to make it collapsible.,
Assemble and collapse your hoop.",How to Make a Hula Hoop3," You need everything in the above section plus a few other things. The entire list includes:


3/4 inch (19.05 mm) 160psi irrigation tubing
A PVC pipe cutter
Four 3/4 inches (19.05 mm) PVC tube connectors
Bungee cord
Uncoated coat hanger wire
A power sander (optional, though preferred)
Several pairs of pliers
A couple of friends (it will be much easier)
A pair of goggles

, Stand up straight and measure the distance from your feet to your chest (or anywhere between your belly button and your chest). This measurement is the diameter of your ideal hoop. You then need to calculate its circumference to know how much tubing you need. (Circumference = Pi (3.14) times Diameter (C=pD))


The average adult hula hoop is 40” in diameter, or 125.6” long. Each piece would then be about 31” long.
Constructing a hula hoop for a child? Then you’ll likely need around 26” in diameter, or 87.9”. Each piece would then be about 22” long.

, This will help you know how the pieces fit back together. It’s sort of like a puzzle, where each one is similar but fits best into a certain other piece. In total you’ll need 8 markings, one for each exposed end.


This can be done with the edge of a knife, scissors, or even with a pen. Don't want to make a permanent mark? Use tape.

, If you’re using a power sander, there’s going to be dust and grime floating up around you everywhere, so be sure to wear goggles or a mask. If you don’t have a power sander, you can do it manually – it just requires a lot of patience and more time.


Take a break from sanding and see how the connector fits into the tube. There should definitely be resistance, but when you’re finished it should snugly fit inside the tubing. Keep sanding until each connector reaches this point.

, This can be done with a blow dryer, hot water on the stove, or an open flame (but an open flame is harder to control and can result in melting). When they become soft and pliable, place the non-sanded ends of the connectors each into a section of tubing, leaving the sanded ends visible and sticking out.


The connectors should be inside the tubing up until about their halfway point. Any further and they won't be able to do their job of connecting.

, You’ll be sort of disassembling it in a second to make it collapsible, but for now you need it in its circular form. The warmed tubing should go over the unsanded ends of the connectors, fitting snugly.

, Here’s how:


Get an 8” long piece of uncoated metal coat hanger. Use it to open the hoop at one of the four exposed points.
Snake the bungee cord through the entire hula hoop until it comes out on the other side.
Pull it taut. Very, very taut. This is where having friends is helpful. You can either pull both ends, or clamp one down to the tubing. Either way, make sure it’s stretched to it’s maximum as this will hold the hoop together when spinning.
Overlap the ends of the cord and wrap the wire around and around it, digging the wire into it.
Using pliers, squeeze the wire against the cord. When secure, cut the ends of the cord off.

, It will take a little effort to pull apart, and that’s good. That means it will keep spinning and stay together. Assemble and disassemble the hoop, making sure it works properly.


If it doesn’t, odds are your bungee cord isn’t tight enough. If it’s too loose, it will collapse on its own when spinning and likely pinch you. Tighten the bungee cord more, reapply the wire, and try again.
When it works, take your hula hoop on the go with you – it’s easy to pack and perfect for traveling.

Look at whether your routine is allowing you to reach your goals.,
Count up the total hours in your weekly workout routine.,
Check your heart rate.,
Figure out your maximum heart rate.,
Reach at least sixty percent of your maximum heart rate.,
Change your routine if your heart rate is staying low.",How to Know if Your Workout Is Too Easy1," You should take a hard look at whether your current workout routine is allowing you to reach your goals. You may have reached a plateau with your current workout routine if you are not seeing results within an expected timeframe and other factors like diet have remained consistent.If you have reached a plateau with your weight loss goals, you could try breaking up your workout into two workouts a day. This will allow you to multiply the calorie burning benefits of exercise, since your heart rate will be increased twice in a day.;
, Considering all of the workouts you do during the week, count up the number of hours that you put in. Guidelines from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommend at least two and a half hours of activity per week. If you are not putting in at least two and a half hours, your workout routine may be too easy., You can manually check your heart rate with your index and middle finger. With one hand facing up, place your index and middle finger one inch below your wrist. Adjust your fingers until you can feel your pulse. Count the number of beats you feel for sixty seconds to get your beats per minute.If you prefer, you can use a heart rate monitor. Place the strap of the heart rate monitor around your chest and look at the wristwatch/readout to see your current heart rate., You can figure out if your workout is too easy by observing whether your heart rate is too low. To figure this out, start by determining your maximum heart rate. A simple way to do this is to minus your age in years from 220.If you are thirty years old, your maximum heart rate will be approximately 190.
If you are forty years old, your maximum heart rate would be 180.

, You will know you are not working hard enough if you do not reach at least sixty percent of your maximum heart rate.Some physical trainers recommend aiming for a higher percentage of your maximum heart rate during workouts, such as 70 to 85 percent.The percentage of your maximum heart rate you strive for will depend on your particular fitness goals, but you should observe your heart rate to make sure you are at least reaching sixty percent.If you are thirty years old, have a maximum heart rate of 190 and you want to maintain at least sixty percent of your maximum heart rate, you should aim for a heart rate of 114 beats per minute. If it goes below that number, you should work a little harder.
If you are not reaching sixty percent, you could work harder by increasing the speed or incline on your treadmill. Run faster until you get to at least sixty percent of your maximum heart rate and then continue for the rest of your workout.
If you are running outside, you could try running very fast for a minute and then going back to your regular pace. Repeat this process until you get to at least sixty percent of your maximum heart rate. You could also try other forms of interval training at the gym., If you have been doing the same routine for a while and you notice your heart rate is not reaching the same level as normal, it could be an indication that you need to switch your workout routine. Consider working a little harder or doing a new exercise to challenge your body in a new way. With your new routine, try to maintain at least sixty percent of your maximum heart rate."

Stay hydrated.",How to Improve Stamina1," Food is the fuel your body gets its energy from. A healthy, well-balanced diet keeps your body healthy and energized, raising your stamina. Try to eat a well-balanced, low-fat diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables and lean meats. For long-lasting energy, doctors also recommend having up to a third of your diet be composed of starches and carbohydrates (whole wheat varieties are preferable).To keep your body steadily supplied with energy throughout get energy by eating several smaller meals throughout the day rather than one or two large meals.
Snack on fruits, raw vegetables, nuts and other lean proteins between meals. Carry high-energy fruit and nut mixes with you during times of extended performance, such as hiking, cycling or cramming for final exams.;
, The health benefits of drinking lots of water are numerous - it can help you lose weight, prevent kidney stones, and much more.Water can also increase stamina by fighting muscle fatigue. Muscle tissue that is under-hydrated can under-perform, so keep your stamina up by drinking water a few hours before strenuous exercise and during your workout as well.If you're starting on a long distance run or an extended exercise, have plenty of fluids with you so they'll be available if you get thirsty later.


If you're likely to drink more fluid if your drink is flavoured, consider using a sports drink like Gatorade, Powerade, etc. to dilute with water in a 7:1 ratio. Add just a splash of the sports drink to your water to add some flavor. These drinks have the added benefit of replacing your body's electrolytes - important nutrients involved in muscle function that are lost when you sweat.However, if you're also trying to lose weight, note that these drinks can be calorie-dense.
Use caffeinated energy drinks sparingly. They're good for a short boost, but can hamper long-term stamina.

Ice your sore muscles.,
Take anti-inflammatory painkillers.,
Stretch and massage your muscles.,
Use a foam roller.,
Eat protein after your workout.,
Up your intake of antioxidants.",How to Ease Sore Muscles After a Hard Workout1," When put ice on your muscles, your blood vessels contract, which reduces the swelling in your muscles and can relieve pain. You can either take a cold shower or use an ice pack to the same effect. To use an ice pack:


Wrap the ice pack or bag of ice in a cloth. You don’t want to have the ice directly against your skin because if you leave it on for too long you can actually give yourself frostbite. Leave the ice on for 10 to 30 minutes. Any time below 10 minutes will have little effect on your muscles, while time over 30 minutes can result in skin damage.;
, Non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can reduce the pain and inflammation you feel after a workout that may have been a little too intense. NSAIDs work by blocking enzymes that produce prostaglandin, a chemical that is partly responsible for muscle inflammation and pain. Common NSAIDs include:


Ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin (you should not take aspirin if you are under 18 years of age).
Keep in mind that these will only provide temporary relief and will not help your muscles repair themselves.

, Stretching your sore muscles can help to relieve tension and work out some of the pain. While you stretch your sore muscle, use one hand to squeeze and and massage the belly of the muscle with your thumb and fingers.Do this for 5 to 10 minutes at a time and 3 to 4 times a day. For example, if you had a sore front thigh:


Sit on a chair with your knees bent. Grab the knee of the leg with the sore thigh with your left hand and squeeze the muscle with the thumb of your right hand, running your thumb from your hip to your knee.

, Using a foam roller to stretch your muscles can help to increase the blood supply to the area and work out toxins that have built up and made your muscles become stiff. To use a foam roller, you place the sore muscle on top of the roller and move your body against the foam. To better understand, take the example of a sore calf. To roll out a calf muscle:


Sit on the floor with both legs straight. Now put the roller under the sore calf. Lift your hip with the support of both hands (your palms and the foot of the leg you are not rolling out should be the only parts of your body touching the floor). Move your calf back and forth on the roller as you move your hip. Do this three or four times a day for five minutes each.

, When you workout, your nitrogen levels can be thrown off. To keep your nitrogen levels balanced, help build muscle and keep your muscles from getting sore, you should try to eat protein after your workout. Try to eat protein 30 to 45 minutes after your workout. It will speed up your muscle’s recovery process to keep them from getting sore.To help you build muscle, you should consume 1.5 grams of protein per kilogram of your body weight.

, Vitamins A, C, and E are all considered antioxidants, which means that they can help your muscles recover from your workout and reduce inflammation. Vitamin C is particularly important for collagen tissue formation which is the basis for muscle tissue repair. You can take vitamin supplements, or you can eat foods rich in these vitamins.


Vitamin A-rich foods: Sweet potato, carrots, kale, spinach, cooked butternut squash, dried apricots, and cantaloupe.Vitamin C-rich foods: Oranges, grapefruits, red and yellow bell peppers, broccoli, kiwi, strawberries, kale and spinach.Vitamin E-rich foods: Tofu, spinach, almonds, sunflower seeds, avocado, and shrimp."

Notice if you are sweating.,
See if you lose your breath at any point during the workout.,
Determine whether you spend more time socializing than exercising.,
Reflect on whether you focus too much on the entertainment.,
Do high intensity interval training.",How to Know if Your Workout Is Too Easy2," If you don’t have to wipe any sweat off your brow while on the treadmill or other cardio machine, your workout may be too easy. Increase the intensity of your cardiovascular workout until you begin to sweat., Take a minute after your cardiovascular workout and observe your breath. If it is fairly deep and heavy, it is a good sign. If it doesn't feel any different than if you were sitting at your office desk, you may need to run or cycle harder., The gym is a social place, which is great but can also distract you from your cardiovascular workout. The same thing can be said about other forms of cardiovascular exercise such as walking or jogging with friends. If you spend more time chatting with friends during your workout, it may have gotten too easy for you.To figure out if this is the case, observe whether you can easily talk with a friend while working out. If you can put together a sentence easily while working out, you may not be pushing yourself hard enough., If you find yourself focusing on your book, magazine or television show more than your cardiovascular workout, your workout may be too easy. Look away from the television or magazine for a minute and check your heart rate. If it is below sixty percent of your maximum heart rate, you may not be pushing yourself enough., If your cardio workout is getting way too easy, you may benefit from a new, less boring form of exercise called high intensity interval training or HIIT. Whether you are on the treadmill, bike or swimming, push yourself very hard for between thirty and ninety seconds. Then, go slow for twice that length of time. Then, bring the intensity back up again for another thirty to ninety seconds. Repeat the process for twenty or thirty minutes for a good cardio workout.If you do HIIT training and it is getting easy, start reducing the rest period between periods of intensity. Keep reducing the period of rest until half of your workout is at a very high intensity and the other half is at a low intensity."

Observe whether the last few repetitions are hard.,
Take notes on your strength training routine.,
Notice if you feel hungry after a workout.,
See if you feel sore.,
Consider whether you have been doing the same routine for too long.",How to Know if Your Workout Is Too Easy3," If you are strength training and the last few repetitions of your set are not difficult, your workout may be too easy. For instance, if you are doing three sets of 6-8 repetitions on a bench press, it should be very hard to complete the last few repetitions on your second and third set. If it is easy, it is a sign that your body has become more efficient with the exercise routine and is burning less calories to complete the same movement. To increase your strength, you need to increase the weight on the bench press or other weighted exercise. Try adding 2.5, 5 or even 10 lbs, depending on how you are feeling.If you add a lot of weight, get somebody to spot you.

, After each exercise, take notes about the difficulty of completing the lifts, as well as whether you were able to complete them in good form. The next time you do a workout, check your notes to see whether a particular strength training exercise was previously completed in good form and to determine an appropriate weight.If you did the exercise seamlessly last time, you should add more weight. Add 2.5, 5 or 10 lbs, depending on how you are feeling. If you add a lot of weight, get somebody to spot you.
If you were unable to complete the exercise in good form previously, do it again at a similar or lower weight until you have perfect form.

, Your body needs protein and other nutrients to repair muscle tissue. However, if you are not pushing yourself hard enough in your weight routine, you may not get your usual hunger pangs after a workout., If you are not pushing yourself hard enough to experience some muscle fatigue after lifting weights, your body may have adapted too much to your workout routine. Try incorporating different movements and exercises into your daily and weekly routine. For instance, try a new group strength training class or get tips from a personal trainer on how to mix up your routine.If you normally do a flat bench press, try doing an incline bench press.
If you normally use machines for strength training, try using more free weights.

, Although a consistent strength training routine is very important for tracking your progress, you need to change things up once in a while. The reason is that your body eventually adapts so well to a routine that it is no longer challenging and the fitness benefits diminish. If you have been doing the same strength training routine for two months, you should definitely try to switch things up or try a new exercise.Fitness trainers recommend switching your routine every six to eight weeks.
If you don’t want to switch your whole routine, you could change part of it. For example, you could add a new exercise in the middle of your routine and keep the end of your routine the same.

Eat sufficient amounts of protein.,
Learn the difference between complete and incomplete proteins.,
Eat foods with a high Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS).,
Include carbohydrates in your diet.,
Eat healthy fats.,
Limit saturated and trans fats.,
Consume plenty of fiber.,
Monitor your salt intake.,
Eat when you're hungry.,
Create a calorie surplus.,
Always eat breakfast.,
Eat less food more often.,
Drink plenty of water all throughout the day.,
Decide whether or not supplements are right for you.,
Consider creatine.,
Take Vitamin C to aid recovery and stimulate muscle growth.,
Be especially careful about hydrating.",How to Eat to Gain Muscle," The rule of thumb is that you need between 0.7 and 0.8 times your body weight in grams of protein. For example, if you weigh 150 pounds, you should eat between 105 and 120 grams of protein per day if you want to consistently gain muscle. If you're overweight, substitute your ideal body weight and calculate in grams. Proteins that are great for building muscle include:


Lean red meat like beef, pork, lamb, venison, bison, etc.
Fish like tuna, salmon, swordfish, bass, trout, mackerel, etc.
Poultry breast, from chicken, turkey, duck, etc.
Eggs (including the yolks)
Dairy like milk, cheese, cottage cheese, yogurt, etc.;
, In order to build muscle, you need to consume complete proteins found in eggs, meat, fish, cheese, milk and most other animal products. Rule of thumb: If it bleeds or breathes, it's a complete protein. There are lots of non-animal complete proteins available, as well, meaning that you can still build muscle as a vegetarian.Complete vegetarian proteins include:


Soy
Quinoa
Buckwheat
Chia
Hempseed
Beans or legumes with rice

, This is a measure of how well different proteins are digested by the body, based on the solubility of the amino acids in the protein. Think of PDCAAS as grading the quality of protein, with 1 being the highest score and 0 the lowest.Here's a breakdown common proteins by their rounded PDCAAS score:


1.00: egg, whey, casein, soy protein
0.9: beef, soybeans
0.7: chickpeas, fruits, black beans, vegetables, other legumes
0.5: cereals and derivatives, peanuts
0.4: whole wheat

, It is important to have carbohydrates so that your body can tap into glycogen (energy) stores within your muscles while you are working out. If you do not eat enough carbohydrates your body will not have energy reserves and will break down your muscles instead! To build muscle, your diet should consist of somewhere between 40% and 60% carbohydrates, or about 1,500 calories per day.Carbs get an unfairly bad reputation from dieting guides. Because complex carbs are broken down slowly and have a low-glycemic index (not as much sugar), they are acceptable to eat after a workout, and especially in the morning at breakfast. Try to select carbohydrates low on the Glycemic Index, which are healthier and release their energy more slowly.Good examples are:

Brown Basmati Rice
Quinoa
Rolled Oats
Sweet Potato
Wholemeal Rye Bread
Wholemeal Spaghetti



, Not all fats are created equal. In fact, there is evidence to suggest that eating healthy fats is actually good for you.You should get about 20% to 35% of your calories from fats. Eat monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. These are the ""better"" fats. They include:


Olive, peanut, sunflower, canola, and avocado oils
Fish
Nuts
Flaxseed and pumpkin seeds
Soy products such as tofu or soy milk

, While there is conflicting evidence about saturated fats and their value in your diet, it is best to limit them. Make sure saturated fats make up no more than 10% of your caloric intake. Trans fats, on the other hand, are proven to be unhealthy (""bad"" fats) and should make up no more than 1% of your caloric intake.Bad fats include:


Ice cream, candy bars, and packaged snack foods
High-fat cuts of meat
Lard, stick margarine, and vegetable shortening
Fried foods

, Remember it is important to include green vegetables in your diet such as spinach or broccoli to ensure that you receive an adequate amount of vitamins. As well, green leafy vegetables are high in fiber which is essential for removing waste from the body.

, It may be true that excessive consumption of salt can lead to hypertension but you lose tremendous amounts of sodium when you sweat. Also, sodium (a key electrolyte) aids in muscle contraction, which is one reason why it is found in many sports drinks.


Research suggests that replacing regular salt with potassium or magnesium salts can reduce sodium intake and may even lower blood pressure in those with high to normal blood pressure., Sounds obvious right? Many muscle-builders get fooled into thinking muscle-building diets need to be more elaborate and complicated than they really do. Eating what you like, within the parameters mentioned in the previous section, is the key to gaining muscle mass consistently. If you're not eating what you like in a regular pattern, it'll be harder to consistently follow through with your diet. Here's a sample diet to give you a better idea of what someone might eat throughout the day:


Breakfast: whole egg omelet with turkey, whole grain toast, banana
Pre-lunch snack: mixed nuts, apple
Lunch: tuna salad with olive oil, onions and capers; sautéed kale
Pre-workout snack: cottage cheese with blueberries
Post-workout snack: protein shake (blend in greens like kale or spinach)
Dinner: orange-soy chicken breast with quinoa; stir-fried carrots, onions, peas, and peppers

, For many muscle-builders, it's important to combine an increase in protein with an increase in calories, so all your hard work at the gym won't work against you. You've got to build up enough fuel to burn as a way of building up your muscles, but not eat so many calories that they'll be transferred into fat. There's an ideal surplus of calories that you can find by calculating your maintenance calorie count, and your surplus.Your maintenance calorie count is the number of calories you need to consume in an average day, with an average amount of energy output, to maintain your current body-weight. For most people with a healthy body-weight, this is around 2,000 calories.
Men should surplus about 250 calories a day (bringing the total to ,), while women should surplus about 150 calories a day (bringing the total to 2,150). Over the course of a given week of muscle-building exercise and proper nutrition, this calorie increase should translate into roughly .25 – .5 pounds of muscle gained per week.

, Breakfast is probably the most important meal of the day aside from your post-workout meal. Eating a breakfast packed with protein, complex carbohydrates, and fiber will get your metabolism going. It will also keep your body from cannibalizing any muscle for energy. Remember the saying: ""Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a pauper."" Because you're not on a diet, however, you don't have to be a pauper at any time.


Get protein into your breakfast. Omelets, shakes (or smoothies) and cottage cheese are great sources of protein.
Eat complex carbohydrates for breakfast. While simple carbohydrates such as sugar and donuts are broken down easily and cause a spike in your sugar levels, complex carbs (oatmeal, bran, beans, whole grains) are broken down over longer periods of time and don't cause spikes in blood sugar.

, Eat at regular intervals to keep from getting so hungry that you splurge when you do eat. Your body will start to get hungry at the predetermined times you do eat because you've kept a consistent routine.


Try eating breakfast, lunch, dinner, post workout, before bed (at least an hour before going to sleep) and slip in two snacks in between. Snacks can include everything from nuts and seeds to sides of veggies or fruit.
If you're trying to gain muscle and lose weight, skip the before-bed meal. Eating right before you go to bed will cause the body to convert any unmetabolized food into fat instead of energy or muscle. Your body's metabolism shuts down right before bedtime.

, Dehydration can mean poor muscle recovery, so make sure you drink lots of water throughout the day. Sip on water throughout your workout. The recommended daily amount of water for men is about 3 liters (0.8 US gal), and 2.2 liters (0.6 US gal) for women.If you don't like the taste of your tap water, get a water filter for your sink. Buying a water filter is an economical way of converting your tap water into healthy, great-tasting water. Buy one and see your water consumption grow.
Don't wait until you're thirsty to drink. Keep a steady supply of water going into your body, so you won't have to gulp or binge on water when you're dehydrated, which risks upsetting your stomach during workouts.

, Natural protein and muscle-building supplements are an easy way to gain more protein without having to actually eat it. Whey and soy proteins are common varieties.


To start, take whey before and after your workouts. Whey powder is the easiest, safest, and most effective way to start using muscle-building supplements. Available widely, whey powder is available in large quantities and easy to use. You can mix it into a shake that's often available in a variety of flavors, and drink it before and after your workouts.
Base the amount of powder you use on your daily protein requirements. Read the instructions on the supplement you're experimenting with and tweak the formula accordingly.

, Creatine is thought to help increase pure muscle mass and help regenerate muscles when not working out, but studies are inconclusive; many studies suggest that creatine causes the muscle tissue to retain fluid, leading to water weight gain. You may want to experiment with creatine but remember it is a supplement and is not necessary to gain muscle mass. Up to 10 grams of creatine, 3 – 5 grams taken before and after workouts, can help boost adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, making you stronger during workouts, making it easier to build muscle.


If you do take the creatine, be sure to drink plenty of water, because the creatine dehydrates your muscles while regenerating and also imbalances your electrolyte levels.
Talk to your doctor about your muscle-building regimen to learn more about whether or not supplements might be right for you, given your history and your health.

, Vitamin C is an antioxidant that helps to neutralize free radical molecules that make work-out recovery a challenge. 500 mg of Vitamin C taken daily will help you maintain a healthy immune system. Gradually, you can build up your Vitamin C intake, to as much as 2000 mg for optimum benefit.

, Some doctors say that whey protein is difficult to digest and can strain your liver or kidneys, especially in large amounts. A high protein diet in general can be straining on the kidneys, so it is important to drink a lot of water. This will flush out your system and negate the negative effects of eating a high protein diet.

Get plenty of physical exercise.,
Choose physical activities that you love.,
Lead an active life.,
Involve others in your activity.",How to Improve Stamina2," Though it will tire you out in the short term, physical exercise increases your overall energy level and stamina over a long period of time. For optimal health and increased stamina, make time in your schedule for regular exercise. For adults, the Department of Health and Human Services recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate cardiovascular exercise per week (or 75 minutes of intense cardiovascular exercise), along with strength-building exercise sessions at least twice a week.Cardiovascular exercise, such as aerobics, running, biking, and dancing, exercises your heart and lungs, increasing the efficiency with which your body supplies oxygen to its muscles. As a result, your body's endurance and stamina will gradually increase (and its fatigue levels decrease) with cardiovascular exercise.
Strength-building exercises, such as weightlifting and body weight exercises (push ups, sit ups, etc.) gradually build the stamina (not to mention the size, definition, and strength) of your muscles. Over time, you'll notice a definite difference - you'll be able to lift bigger loads for longer.

, It's easier to push yourself physically, improving your stamina, when you're doing something you genuinely enjoy, rather than something you dread. Tailor your workout to include mostly activities that you enjoy - these may be things that you're already good at, but they may also be things that you haven't tried yet. If you're not sure which types of exercise you enjoy, experiment by including many different kinds in your workout for a month or two. You may discover, for instance, that you prefer low-impact exercises, like swimming and biking, over your previous attempts running, or you may discover the opposite!

, If you're very, very busy, you may simply not have enough time every week for exercise. Luckily, you can mitigate some of the negative effects that come from the lack of a regular exercise routine by simply keeping in motion throughout the day. Avoid staying still for long periods of time - almost any type of movement is good for your cardiovascular health; the more, the better. Instead of driving to work, bike or walk. If your job has you in front of a computer all day, use a standing desk or a walking desk instead of sitting. Wear a pedometer and shoot for a goal of 10,000 steps every day. The more you're up and about, the better your overall health and stamina.

, If you find that you're not able to achieve the stamina level you'd like on your own, consider doing your physical activity of choice in the company of friends. Believe it or not, friends can make it substantially easier to push yourself physically. Friends can offer you encouragement when you're tired. They can even give you a few well-meaning verbal jabs to keep you ""pumped up."" Finally, in the presence of friends, you may find that you don't want to quit - that you want to impress your friends by pushing yourself to the limit.


Your exercise partners don't have to be friends or peers. Bring the kids, the dog or a neighbour when you go for your daily exercise activity. You can also join a gym that offers to pair you with exercise buddies or enroll in exercise classes where you can make new friends that you know will have similar fitness goals to your own.

"
"
Get plenty of rest.,
Build up to your target level of stamina gradually.",How to Improve Stamina3," While it's important to stay active with exercise, if you're shooting for high stamina it's just as important to stay well-rested. A good night's rest should leave you refreshed, energized, and focused, ensuring that you'll be able to physically give your all. Inadequate rest, on the other hand, can leave you groggy and under-performing. Bad sleeping habits have also been linked to a number of health problems that can negatively impact your stamina: weight gain, high blood pressure, and illness, to name a few.While everyone's sleep needs are different, the National Sleep Foundation recommends 7-9 hours of sleep per night for adults.Getting less than 6 hours of sleep per night is generally considered unhealthy and has been linked to the health concerns listed above.

, Any attempt to improve your stamina through exercise should be approached somewhat gradually - try to do too much too early, and you may exhaust yourself or give up. Instead, set simple, specific goals as stepping stones to your major goal, like first running 1 kilometer, then, in two weeks, 2 kilometers (1.2 mi), then 5 kilometers (3.1 mi), and finally 10 kilometers (6.2 mi). Celebrate each milestone you reach as an achievement. Build up: Don't give up!


For cardiovascular exercise, start out slowly, mildly increasing your heart rate and maintaining that heart rate for no more than 30 minutes the first time. Increase the intensity and duration of your performance by small, realistic intervals until you reach your goal. Within a few months, you'll likely have made serious improvement while barely noticing the change!
For strength-building exercise, begin at a weight or resistance level that's easily manageable. Add only a few small weights to your barbell or exercise machine. Alternatively, if you're doing a body weight exercise, you can usually modify the exercise to make it easier in some way - dropping your legs to make a push up easier or doing a crunch instead of a sit up, for instance. Gradually increase the weight, resistance, or intensity of your exercise to smoothly build strength over time.

Devote time to improving your sexual stamina.",How to Improve Stamina4," Many people hoping to improve their physical stamina have one specific goal in mind - longer, better sex. Improving your sexual stamina is partly a matter of improving your physical fitness, so the exercise tips in this section are all of use if your lovemaking sessions are often cut short because you find yourself exhausted or out of breath during sex. Chronically short lovemaking can also have a variety of hormonal or medical causes, though these can be rare - if you're already physically fit and you have poor sexual stamina, you may want to see a doctor just in case. However, sex is much more than a purely physical activity. Just as important as your physical health is your emotional well-being. An inability to have satisfying sex is often the result of emotional issues or interpersonal problems within a relationship. Below are just a few of the causes of unsatisfying sex, along with notes about possible cures:Erectile Dysfunction. Men who have difficulty maintaining an erection may, when they do get one, rush to orgasm. Luckily, a variety of medications are available to treat ED. Make an appointment with your doctor - most ED medications are available only via prescription.

Biological Causes. Hormone disorders, brain chemical imbalances, thyroid problems, and, rarely, nerve damage, can all make it difficult to have satisfying sex. In this case, because the root causes vary and are not immediately obvious, it's best to receive evaluation from a doctor before proceeding with a treatment.

Medicinal Causes. Certain medications can interfere with your libido, making long, satisfying sex difficult. In this case, you may want to discuss alternate treatment options with your doctor.

Anxiety issues. Sex, particularly if you're inexperienced, can be intimidating. Stress and nervousness can make it difficult to ""get in the mood"" or cause you to finish early. If this is the case, do what you can to calm yourself and remain stress-free before sex - realize that, for all the importance we place on it, sex doesn't need to be nerve-wrecking. If you can't seem to calm you jitters, make an appointment with a counsellor or therapist.

Relationship issues. Sometimes, unsatisfying sex can be the result of emotional problems or tensions between the two partners. In this case, it's best to talk frankly and openly with your partner, though, if you think you need it, it's also appropriate to contact a couples counsellor.

Visualize your goal.,
Break your problem into pieces.,
Build your ability to focus.,
Eliminate distractions.,
Use stimulants sparingly.,
Talk to others.,
Take breaks.",How to Improve Stamina5," It's easy to get mentally sidetracked if you're focused on the difficulties that lie in the details of the task you're trying to complete, rather than the goal you hope to achieve. Don't miss the forest for the trees - never lose sight of the prize. Always keep your final product in mind as you approach any trying task - this will help you stay focused and keep you from wasting time on inconsequential side-tasks.


You don't even have to focus on your literal goal - you can try thinking of other triumphant imagery. Close your eyes and let your mind wander - build a mental picture of yourself finishing a race with a burst of speed or getting an A on the final exam. Just don't fall asleep!
Avoid dwelling on the challenges, obstacles or hurdles you may face before reaching your goal, but be aware of them and work hard to overcome the hurdles and reach your goal.
In school, keep your motivation high and build your stamina for studying prior to final exam week by hosting study sessions for friends all school year.

, If you think of your problem as one big, monolithic task, it's very easy to get discouraged. Instead, keep your mental stamina high by breaking your work into smaller, easier chunks. Focus on doing the most important things first or completing the process as a series of sequential steps. The sense of accomplishment you'll get from completing each small piece of your problem will help keep you focused and attentive as you tackle the rest of your work.

, Your brain isn't a muscle, but it can be strengthened like one. Work up your ability to concentrate and focus on serious work over time in the same way you would build strong muscles. Gradually increase the duration and intensity of your mental tasks. Over time, doing an amount of mental work that would previously have left you exhausted will seem normal - even easy.


For instance, if you're trying to learn guitar, but find it too difficult to concentrate on the repetitive early tasks of practicing basic chords and scales, try practicing every day, increasing the amount of time you practice daily by five minutes every week. For example, practice 30 minutes per day the first week, 35 the second, etc. In less that two months, you'll be practicing an hour a day and you'll be well on your way to gaining some serious fretboard skills.

, Often, when faced with a difficult task, people allow themselves to procrastinate by pursuing meaningless distractions. To keep your mental stamina high and stay focused on your task, clear these distractions from your life. If, for instance, you have a bad habit of playing online games instead of getting started on the pile of work in your ""In"" box, download a free productivity app that blocks gaming websites. If you waste time reading trashy magazines instead of writing the novel you've been planning, cancel your subscriptions. Do anything and everything you can to isolate yourself with your work - you'll have no excuse but to do it!


Clear your schedule. Check your calendar for upcoming events that will interfere with your ability to devote yourself to your work - if you've got a serious schedule conflict, give up or reschedule the ""fun"" event in favor of your work.

, Coffee and energy drinks can be useful if you're looking for a short-term energy boost, as caffeine can cause your energy level and focus to sky-rocket. However, these things aren't useful to improve long-term mental stamina, as they often cause you to ""crash"" after the initial boost, becoming drowsier than you were before. They can also be habit-forming - if you develop an addiction to caffeine, it may lose its usefulness even as a temporary pick-me-up.


Never use prescription stimulants (like Adderall, etc.) as a work or study aid - these drugs can have powerful side effects and shouldn't be used unless they're prescribed by a doctor.

, If you're relying your mental stamina to get you through an emotionally trying time like a breakup or a personal loss, know that almost any problem is easier to get through if you share it. Confide in a friend, family member, loved one, or other trusted person when you're having trouble enduring in times of distress. Often, it'll feel good simply to open up about how you're feeling - these people don't necessarily need to help you solve your problems to make you feel better.


If you're hesitant to talk to others because your problems are very personal, it even help simply to express your problems to yourself. Think about how you feel deep down at your core and write these feeling down in a journal or private notebook. After a short time, come back and read these thoughts - you may find that you're surprised at what you wrote and that you're now able to focus more clearly on overcoming your issues.

, Just like physical stamina, mental stamina requires plenty of rest. If you've been concentrating hard on finishing a task or getting through a difficult situation, give yourself a brief break when you get a chance. If you're at the office, step out into the hallway for some peace and quiet or splash some water on your face in the restroom. If you're having a hard time maintaining a smile at a tense social event, excuse yourself and, for a few minutes, simply allow yourself to rest. You'll be amazed how much even a brief respite from a mentally trying situation will leave you feeling refreshed, recharged, and ready to soldier on.

Try not to hit the gym for two or three days after a workout that has left your muscles very sore. This will give your muscles time to heal.


When you workout before your muscles are ready, there is a possibility that you can injure them further.

, While you may not feel like moving at all when your muscles are really sore, swimming can actually make you feel a lot better. The cold water can reduce the pain and inflammation in your muscles, while moving your body without putting pressure on it (the beauty of being weightless in a pool) can increase the blood supply to your muscles and wash out toxins.


Try to swim laps for 20 to 30 minutes at a light to moderate pace.

, While applying heat to your muscles right after your workout should generally be avoided, heat can help your muscles repair themselves after 72 hours have passed. Heat increases the blood flow to the area, which helps to speed up the healing process. The oxygen the blood carries will help to nourish your muscles and help them regain their normal range of movement.


You can take a hot shower or bath, or use heating pads to relieve tension in your muscles.

, Another way you can apply heat to your muscles is to take an epsom salt bath. Taking an epsom salt bath can ease your sore muscles and reduce the pressure your workout put on them because the salt can help restore your magnesium levels.To make an epsom salt bath:


Fill your bathtub with warm to hot water and then pour about two cups of epsom salt into the bath. Stir the water and then soak in the bath for 15 minutes. Take two or three baths a week as your muscles repair themselves.
You can also apply essential oils like chamomile, lavender, or peppermint to your baths. These essential oils can help you relax mentally, which in turn helps your muscles relax.

, After three days have passed, you can get a massage if your muscles are still in a great deal of pain. A massage therapist will relax your tight muscles by stimulating your cells through massage techniques. This cell stimulation will help stimulate blood flow to your muscles, helping your muscles cells to produce energy that will repair your muscles.


If you don’t want to pay money for a massage, ask a family member or friend to give you a massage. If they don’t know how to give a massage, they can read this article.

Stretch immediately after a hard workout.,
Do a hamstring stretch.,
Try a hip flexor stretch.,
Work into a low back stretch.,
Do a quadriceps stretch.",How to Ease Sore Muscles After a Hard Workout3," In order to keep your muscles from getting sore after an intense workout, it is important that you stretch them. Stretching helps to get rid of lactic acid that can build up in your muscles when you work out. This lactic acid can make your muscles sore if it is not released through stretching. The following steps are some stretches you can try to keep your muscles from getting sore.


You should also try to do 10 or 15 minutes of light cardio after an intense workout to loosen your muscles up and keep your blood flowing. After your cardio, move into your stretches.

, To do a hamstring stretch, sit on the floor with your back straight. Extend your right leg straight out in front of your and bend your left leg so that the sole of your left foot is flat on the inside of your right leg. Slowly bend forward with your arms stretched in front of your. Try to touch your extended right foot. You should feel a stretch in your hamstrings.Hold this stretch for 15 seconds and then release. Repeat this stretch on your other leg.

, Lie on the floor with your back flat. Extend your right leg so that it is straight and bend your left leg so that it is bent towards your knee. Use your right arm to pull your left leg towards the right side of your chest. Turn your head so that it is facing your left side while you hold the pose.Hold the stretch for 10 seconds. When the time is up, repeat the stretch on your other leg.

, Lie on the floor with your back flat. Bend your knees with your soles of your feet on the ground. Use your hands to pull your knees towards your chest, keeping your feet flat on the ground. Raise your head and shoulders as much as you can.Hold this stretch for 30 seconds, then let your head and shoulders slowly drop to the ground. Repeat this stretch five times.

, Lie on your right side and bend your right leg so that it is making a 90 degree angle. Bend your left leg backward so that you can hold your ankle with your left hand. Pull your left ankle toward your lower back until you feel a stretch in your quads. Lower the left knee to the floor so that it is behind the right one.Hold this stretch for 15 seconds and then repeat the same stretch on your right leg.

Warm-up before the workout.,
Stop the workout if you feel any pain.,
Start with low-intensity exercises and increase the workouts difficult by 10% every week.,
Keep your movements controlled to avoid injuries.,
Eat a balanced diet.,
Add turmeric and ginger to your diet.",How to Ease Sore Muscles After a Hard Workout4," When you warm up before your workout, your muscles will be more prepared for the real workout. This means that the blood will be flowing to your muscles and you reduce the chances that you will overexert your muscles and make them sore.


Try to warm up for at least 5 minutes before your real workout begins. Follow this with 5 minutes of light stretching (see Method 3). Good warm ups include light cardio like jogging on a treadmill or riding a stationary bike. Try to get your heart pumping.

, If you feel a sudden cramp or pain during a workout, stop immediately. Do not try to run through the cramp because the pain may mean that you have torn or strained a muscle. Instead, rest for several minutes and drink some water. If you continue to feel pain, stop the workout entirely.

, If you are just starting up a new workout regimen, it is important to start off with easier exercises to reduce the risk of hurting your muscles. As your workouts progress, try to increase their difficulty by 10% every week.For example:


If you are training for a running race, begin your training by running 10 miles (16 km) a week. Increasing your workout by 10% each week means that you should add one mile each week. That means that you should run 10 miles (16 km) your first week, 11 miles (18 km) the second, 12 miles (19 km) the third week, etc.

, Try to be careful when making sudden movements like jumping or lifting heavy weights, as these quick movements could lead to straining or tearing your muscles. Instead, try to keep your movements controlled and slow to avoid injury.

, Keeping your body healthy is an important part of making sure that you do not overstress your muscles. Try to eat a balanced diet to keep your body strong and healthy. A balanced diet means meeting all of your basic dietary needs each day. Try to eat portions of:


Fruits and vegetables.
Lean protein.
Complex carbs like whole wheat bread.
Unsaturated fats.
Low-fat dairy products.

, Both turmeric and ginger have anti-inflammatory properties that can help can help keep your muscles from getting swollen. You can add these ingredients to your meals, take supplements, or drink ginger and turmeric teas.

Eat spicy foods.",How to Get a Little Healthier While Staying Just as Lazy1," If you’re right-handed, put your fork in your left hand at meals. Using your nondominant hand as your fork hand makes you eat more slowly. Stop eating when you feel full, but not bloated. You’ll eat more slowly and probably consume less food., Buy those Milano cookies, but also make an effort to buy frozen fruit for smoothies and snap pea crisps to snack on, too.Over time, try to eat fewer cookies and more of the healthy snacks you have on hand.

, Water will fill you up a little bit, so you won’t overeat at your next meal. Make it a habit to keep a water bottle near you at all times, whether you’re in your house or on the go., People who drink three to five cups of coffee a day are less likely to show early symptoms of heart disease. Don’t skip out of your morning cup of coffee or that afternoon pick me up., People who eat on smaller plates end up eating less food. Buy a few inexpensive smaller plates and bowls if yours are large. You’ll think you’ve eaten more than you have., Spicy foods may help to decrease your appetite. Go for extra hot salsa, some chili peppers, or cayenne pepper. Add it to your food for extra flavor and a health boost!"

Practice good posture at all times.,
Understand the importance of good posture.,
Understand the dynamics of a shoulder joint.",How to Improve Your Posture With Rowing Exercises1," For a few people, stretching and corrective exercises are not necessary; these people are able to maintain a good posture just because it makes sense and they are constantly aware of their posture. For the rest of us, stretching and doing corrective exercises consistently may keep the posture muscles strong over the course of your lifetime. To practice good posture, have a good posture in all situations: standing, sitting, walking, playing, working, and lifting.


Good posture consists of keeping the spine straight and carrying the shoulders neither rounded nor pulled back.
Maintain this posture even when bent over at the waist while working, playing or lifting.
Occasionally check your posture in the mirror. Try to learn the way your body feels when you have good posture vs. bad posture, so you can identify when you're slipping into a bad pose simply by the way your body feels.;
,


Mechanically, it is easier on your lower back if your weight is not shifted forward such as it is when you round your shoulders.
Your joints will hurt the least, or not at all, if they are seated properly.
Anatomically, your spines have holes (foramens) that house nerves, so you do not want to damage those nerves by bending or twisting the spine excessively. The spine, for the most part, was not really designed for bending or twisting a lot. Bending is best done with the knees and at the waist (hips). Look at a skeleton and muscle chart of the inter-spinal muscles, and you will see that they are small and short.
The long and bigger muscles, such as the latissimus dorsi or ""lats or wings,"" facilitate wide ranges of movements. The lats pull the upper arm towards the body in a downwards motion and is a strong muscle. But once the upper arm passes body, the lats no longer come into play because muscles can only contract. The smaller muscles like the rhomboid and back deltoids pull the upper arm further back.

, Think of a joint as an electric, telephone, and cable utility pole standing with guy wires on either side. If the tension is too great on one side, there will be stress on the pole. A shoulder joint has chest muscles normally shortening and pulling the shoulders forward. To correct the shoulders from hunching forward, stretch your chest muscles and/or strengthen the muscles of your upper back that pull your upper arm beyond the center line. These muscles are the rhomboids and posterior deltoids.

Assess both of your fitness levels.,
Choose the right time of day to exercise.,
Socialize your dog properly.,
Teach your dog to heel.,
Warm up with your dog before you work out.,
Know the signs of overdoing the exercise.,
Hydrate and reward your puppy pal (and yourself) post-workout.",How to Exercise With Your Dog1," Your dog's ability to participate in the same exercises as you will be dependent on his current fitness level. If he isn't very fit, you'll need to tailor your exercise to help him reach better fitness. And if he has health problems, speak to your vet about the issues involved for your dog when exercising. In fact, it's strongly recommended that you have your dog fully examined by the veterinarian prior to starting any exercise regime.Before running with you, your dog should be able to walk 30 to 60 minutes without getting tired. A dog not able to do this will require concentration on improving his base fitness first.
A fit dog should eventually be able to run about 5 kilometers (3.1 mi) with you, gradually building up to 10 kilometers (6.2 mi). Beyond this amount, talk to your vet.
Don’t forget to talk to your own doctor about beginning an exercise regimen, especially if you lead a sedentary lifestyle, or have underlying health conditions or ongoing injuries.;
, Dogs pant to release heat, which limits their ability to cool off vis-a-vis a sweating human. As such, restrict the time of exercise to the cooler parts of the day, either early mornings or evenings. This is also better for you because it keeps you out of the heat and UV rays of the sun at its hottest. It may also suit your daily schedule better.Always be prepared to watch for signs of overheating or even heat stroke in your dog. More information can be found here.

, Do you know how your dog reacts when meeting other dogs? You don't want to find out for the first time when he decides to brawl with another dog while you're in your exercise gear and far from home. Be certain that he'll ignore other dogs or behave civilly around them when coming across them.Just as importantly, how do you feel when you come across other dogs as you're out and about exercising? You need to feel assured that you can handle situations of possible confrontation with other dogs and handle your dog appropriately.

, The only way you’ll be able to achieve an effective workout with your dog is if he is in sync with your body movements. Teaching your pup the basic command of “heel” will allow you to keep your dog under control while on or off the leash. Check out Teach Your Dog to Heel for detailed instructions, or try the following quick summary method:


Have your leashed pup sit or stand next to your left leg with both of you facing the same direction.
Bring a treat pouch containing small treats. You will be rewarding your dog often.
Say your dog’s name, make eye contact and walk two steps forward. If your pup walks with you, reward him with a treat. If he doesn’t catch on, back up and repeat this step until he walks with you.
Repeat the two step movement several times until it becomes second nature for your pup to follow you.
Increase the heel movement to four and then six steps, rewarding your pup along the way.
If your dog becomes bored or lags behind, take a break. However, if he continues this behaviour say, “aah-ahh” and his name to gain his attention. Go back to the basic steps and then reward.
Practice as often as possible - twice a day is ideal.

, Although some experts doubt the necessity of a doggy warm up, consider your individual dog’s personality and fitness level. If your pup is carrying a few extra pounds, has joint problems or is getting up there in years, it won't hurt to give him a quick warm up while you stretch.Here are some easy warm-up methods to try:


Play fetch for a few minutes. Allow your dog to get some of that pent-up energy out by throwing the ball or Frisbee a few times and allowing him to sprint after it. However, only do this for a few minutes so you don’t wear him out completely. Note that a good half hour game of Frisbee in the park can serve as a workout for both of you in its own right.
Try a slow, leisurely warm up pace. Work up to your power walk by initially starting out with a casual walk. This will also give you an opportunity to practice and reinforce the heel before you head out.

, A dog that is enjoying himself will appear happy and alert, not tired or fretful. Sitting or lying down, dropping behind you or just stopping are good indicators that your dog has had enough. Don't misinterpret these signs as stubbornness when it comes to exercise workouts. Also, any sign of lameness should be taken seriously and checked by the vet as soon as possible.

, Hydrate with fresh cool water for you and your dog. Consider offering him a special healthy treat––one that won’t pack on extra pounds but will taste like a huge reward after a good workout.Try offering frozen bananas or blueberries. If your dog has been out on a hot day, reward him with a piece of frozen banana or blueberries. Both have plenty of vitamins and taste wonderful, especially when frozen.
Make sure your dog has enough to drink. Allow him to drink as much as he wants following a workout. Your dog will let you know when he feels hydrated. Add a few ice cubes to your dog’s water to keep it extra cool or just give him some ice as a treat.
Allow for rest time. Lead your dog to his favorite place to rest for a post-workout nap. In fact, consider taking one yourself as restorative sleep is one of the best ways to keep pounds at bay.

Stretch.,
Do a doorway chest stretch.,
Do a bent-over row with a light dumbbell.,
Try a seated tube row.",How to Improve Your Posture With Rowing Exercises2," Stretching exercises and body awareness may be enough for you. Warm-up or be warm before stretching. A warm-up can be an ordinary activity like housework or walking. Being warm can be from working or from dynamic stretches. Since the muscles to be stretched are so small, a specific warm up is easily done by swinging your arms sideways and horizontally for a couple of minutes. Or, your warm-up could be athletic (hitting a ball), aerobic (reaching side to side or forward), or freestyle (dancing, shadowboxing).


It may also be helpful for you to take a thorough, warm bath or shower after working out.

, Perform this stretch when your body is warmed up. You can do it as much as you like, or as infrequently as once a week. Make sure you are stretching your chest muscles and not your spine or hips; the stretch you feel should just be in your chest.


Stand with your forearm against a doorframe or against the corner of a wall. Your elbow should be bent at a 90 degree angle.Rotate your chest away from your arm until you begin to feel a stretch in your chest and shoulder.Turn your head away from your arm, which will increase the stretch.Hold the position for at least 20 seconds, then switch to the other arm.

, Using a dumbbell of no more than ten pounds, perform a bent-over row. This exercise works the small muscle in your back called rhomboids and it stretches your chest. You can perform it weekly or as little as twice a month.


Start bent-over with your free hand bracing on your knee and with the other hand grasping the dumbbell with the elbow straight. Keep your back straight.
Shrug your shoulders back and keep your shoulders tight until you finish this exercise. This is the most important form consideration for this exercise. Tight is not having your shoulders round. Tight is tensing the muscles of your shoulder.

Lift the dumbbell in a curved motion and not in a straight line up and down. Exhale and lift the dumbbell to your side, roughly to your hip. Holding the weight here, squeeze your back muscles for a few seconds.Inhale as you lower the dumbbell to the starting point.

, Use a resistance band with handles to do this stretch. Note that each color represents a different resistance.


Sit on the ground with your legs extended, back straight. Hold the ends of the resistance band and loop the tube around your feet. Your arms should be extended.Keeping your back straight, bend at the elbows and draw your hands back toward your ribs. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and hold for a few seconds.Slowly release, then repeat the exercises for the recommended number of repetitions."

Consider your suitability for jogging, running or walking.,
Start off on the right pace.,
Start moving a bit faster.,
Work up to longer distances and a faster pace.",How to Exercise With Your Dog2," These simple but beneficial exercises can work well for both of you; however, take note that some dog species are better suited to running than others. Dogs with a lean build, deep chest and long muzzle tend to be best for running. Also, don't run with a dog until his skeleton is mature; prior to that, damage could occur.If running or jogging is too much to handle for one or both of you, stick to walking, building up your pace as you progress over time. Talk to your dog’s vet and your own doctor if you have concerns about fitness levels or experience discomfort.

, At the pace of a typical leisurely dog walk, you may not elevate your heart rate much above resting. Instead of letting your dog sniff, chase or investigate every bush or tree, you'll need to let him know you mean business. This may take a few days to establish a routine of a stepped-up pace, so be patient.Begin your walk or jog by making initial eye contact and practicing “heel.” After a while he’ll associate this behaviour with exercise.
Start your workout by walking at a brisk pace. Even a 19 minute mile (12 min./km) pace in the beginning will get your dog focused on the matter at hand.
Keep the leash relatively tight but not so tight that the dog has no wiggle room. You want some tension on the leash, but you also want your dog to feel free to maintain a similar pace without being pulled or dragged.
It's recommended that you keep to soft surfaces when jogging or running, to protect your dog's footpads.

, After walking approximately half of a mile (0.8 km), pick up the pace to ultimately jogging or walking a 15 minute mile (9 min./km) if your dog is in good shape. Unfortunately, if you're interested in running several miles at an eight minute mile (5 min./km) pace, you may need to leave your pup at home and instead do your cool down miles together.Consider using the ""interval walk"". This consists of alternating your walk with jogging, running backwards and side shuffling for small increments of time. This varies the pace and technique, and is both useful at building up your dog's acceptance of the workout routine and at making the exercise more enjoyable.
Playing dog tag in the park can be a fun way to get in some running and chasing exercise all while having some fun. Only allow a dog off the leash where regulations permit. But if you do find places where this can be done, it's excellent exercise for your dog (and you).

, If you're just beginning to run or walk with your pup, take it slowly and gradually increase your distance and speed. Notice where your dog is located in relation to you. Dogs tend to prefer being in front of you, so if your dog slows down and is walking or running alongside or behind you, it's time to stop.Begin the first few weeks only walking or slowly jogging between 30 to 40 minutes. Take plenty of rest and water breaks for the dog and consider interval training. Perhaps jog at a 15 minute mile pace for five minutes and then take the intensity down to a casual walk for 10 minutes in the beginning.
After approximately six weeks of regular exercise, your canine pal may be ready to go for the gusto and complete an hour of solid cardio.

Expand your exercise horizons with your canine pal.,
Try swimming.,
Give agility training a go.,
Give cycling a spin.,
Consider rollerblading or roller skating.,
Dive into “doga.” This is a cross between yoga and dog––so obviously it's yoga with your dog!",How to Exercise With Your Dog3," Although jogging and walking seem to be the norm, there are many other workouts you and your best bud can do together. Mixing up your exercise routine can help prevent boredom; variety also helps ensure that neither of you are overworking some muscles at the expense of others., Especially if you have a dog that loves water (such as an Irish Water Spaniel), swim a few laps with your pal. Keep an eye on your dog throughout the swim to ensure he isn’t struggling or having trouble while in the water––some dogs may need a flotation device to help keep their head above water.This is a good exercise for dogs with joint problems. However, you may not be able to do a lot of lap swimming if you need to keep an eye on your dog––keep this in mind when selecting this as a team exercise. If your dog does not feel comfortable in the water, don't put them in.
Like people, some dogs — even if they belong to a supposedly water-loving breed — simply never become good swimmers. Give it a try, but don’t force the issue.

, Make an obstacle course (hurdles, tunnels, ropes, etc.) for your dog. Use the same obstacles, or create comparable ones, for yourself. Running, jumping and crawling are a great way to use different muscles. They also spur both of you to exercise another important muscle––the brain. In the meantime, you have the obligation to keep up!As with every other human-plus-dog exercise routine, keep in mind your respective fitness levels and watch for signs of exhaustion or injury.

, A slow bike ride with your dog by your side is a great way to help your pup expend some pent up energy. Keep an eye on your dog throughout the entire ride. Your dog is expending considerably more energy than you, so look for telltale signs that he is pooped. Also be sure to take breaks for your dog as they need to do their business.


For bigger and more athletic dogs, you might try “bikejoring.” This exercise involves connecting your dog to the bike with a harness so he can pull and run while you ride.The winter equivalent to “bikejoring” is cross-country “skijoring.” Winter sports can be a blast with your dog. Instead of taking a brisk walk in the snow, strap on some cross country skis and work out with your pup by your side.

, Slipping some wheels on your feet can make for an enjoyable exercise time for the two of you. However, only a fully confident rollerblader/skater should attempt to perform this workout with their dog. Also, make sure your pup has mastered the skill of heel and is generally obedient so he doesn’t pull you off the path.


Make sure to wear a helmet and proper safety equipment, even if you are an expert roller. You never know when your canine pal may dart off after a rabbit or toward a hot dog cart.

, This can be a calm and pleasant workout experience for the two of you; look for a class in your area. If there isn't a class, check out videos online and follow the instructions with care.Not surprisingly, some dogs may simply be too active or high-strung for “doga.” But it’s worth a try.

Create a workout from your dog’s typical behaviours.,
Create an interval training course with your exercise equipment.,
Run like a dog, with your dog.,
Turn your usual dog games into your actual workout.",How to Exercise With Your Dog4," With a bit of creativity, you can turn common doggy instincts like fetching, chasing, circling around, and jumping into a solid workout routine that matches your own. How you go about this really depends on the type of workout and the dog's reaction to it.


When doing sit-ups, hold a dog toy. Every time you sit up, pretend to throw the toy. Your dog should think it has been thrown and try to chase after it. A variation on this is to have a whole basket of toys to toss, grabbing one and actually throwing it every time you stretch up. You can take any retrieved toys back off your dog each alternate stretch back up.When doing any upward stretch, hold a toy before your dog and reach it right up to the sky, encouraging your dog to jump for it. Great for your upward stretching, fun for him.

, Place your usual exercise equipment in the backyard when the weather is good. Ensure that the equipment is at even intervals––you're turning this into an exercise course for you and an obstacle course for your dog. Place your dog on a leash and walk through all the things you've set up, such as jumping rope, dancing with your hula hoop and stretching with your stretch bands. At each interval, have him wait for you or, if he gets bored, try to involve him in some way.


Every time he runs off, see it as a chance to rev up your workout as you chase him back. A variation on this is to include agility style obstacles that are made just for your dog. That way he gets to do some special workout activities too., When running, capitalize on your dog's natural inclination to stop and sniff at random intervals as an opportunity for improving your own agility. Being able to stop or turn during a run at a moment's notice is an excellent skill to develop for sports and general fitness.


If you dog stops for an extended sniff or to take care of some doggy business, do some dynamic stretches, jumping jacks, push ups, etc.
Of course, you should still make sure you can control your dog with the “heel” command, and can get him to spend more time exercising than sniffing.

, This approach is great if you're the athletic type, as you'll both get a great all-round workout. Playing fetch, throwing or dribbling a ball to/with your dog, having a tug-of-war, and playing hide and seek with him can be workout material without too much difficulty involved in setting it up.Try flyball, flying disc and freestyle dancing as other fun options.
”Fetch” workouts can be especially fun for Retriever/sport breeds like Labradors and Spaniels.
Terriers love tug-of-war, as they love to hold onto things! Avoid playing tug-of-war until your dog knows how to drop on command though, or you risk over-exciting the dog (in which case he can become aggressive).
Herding dogs like sheepdogs, collies, and corgis may enjoy playing soccer with you.
Although your dog will probably prefer some games over others, try to sprinkle in a variety of activities to ward off boredom or over-exertion of certain muscles or joints.

Keeping your back as straight as possible, lean to the right and try to touch your right toes with your hands. Don't worry if you can't—just try as hard as possible. Hold this stretch for 30 to 60 seconds, then repeat on your left leg.
Next, extend your arms straight out in front of you, as far as they can go. Try to get your chest to touch the floor. Hold this stretch for 30 to 60 seconds.;
, Touching your toes, from both a seated and standing position, helps to stretch out your hamstrings and lower back.









To do the stretch while sitting down, sit on your bottom with your legs together and your toes pointing up towards the ceiling. Lean forwards and try to touch your toes. If you can't, grab your ankles. If touching your toes is too easy, try wrapping your hands around the soles of your feet. Hold this stretch for 30 to 60 seconds.
To do the stretch while standing up, stand with your feet together, then lean down and try to touch your toes. Avoid bending your knees and try to keep most of your weight on the balls of your feet instead of on your heels. If you're really flexible, try to get the palms of your hands on the floor. Hold the stretch for 30 to 60 seconds.

, The butterfly stretch works the groin and inner thighs, making it extremely important for the splits.









Sit on the floor and bend your knees until they point outwards and the soles of your feet are pressed together. Try to push your knees as close to the floor as possible (using your elbows if necessary), while drawing your heels as close to the groin as possible.
Sit upright and keep your back as straight as possible. Hold this stretch for 30 to 60 seconds. For a more intense stretch, place your palms on the floor in front of your toes, then try to stretch forward as far as possible.

, The lunge stretch helps to loosen your hips, which is necessary for performing a good split.









Get into a lunge position by stepping forward with your right foot and bending both knees until your right thigh is parallel with the ground and your left shin is touching the ground.
Place your hands on your hips and keep your back straight. Gradually shift your weight forwards until you feel a stretch around your hip and the top of your thigh. Hold this position for 30 to 60 seconds, then repeat on the other leg., Your quads and hamstrings are two of the most important muscles involved in the splits, so it's important to get them as flexible as possible. Here are two more useful stretches for these muscles:









To stretch your quads, kneel down in a lunging position, using a pillow to support your back knee if necessary. Keeping your back straight, reach back and grab the foot of your back leg and pull it towards your butt until you feel a good stretch in the quadricep. Hold for 30 to 60 seconds, then repeat on the other leg.
To stretch your hamstrings, lie down with your back on the floor and your legs propped up against a straight wall. Keeping your lower back on the floor, reach towards your toes until you feel a good stretch (but no pain). Hold for 30 seconds.

Modify the movement as necessary.",How to Do the Windshield Wiper Stretch1," The basic windshield wiper stretch is done from a supine position (i.e., lying face up) on the floor. Bend your knees so that your feet are resting flat on the floor, and extend your arms straight out to either side.Check the position of your shoulder blades. Your shoulders should be rolled back, with your shoulder blades flat against the floor. Keep your shoulder blades pressed against the floor for the entire stretch.;
, For the starting position of the windshield wiper stretch, your thighs will be perpendicular to the floor with your knees in the air. Make sure your lower back is pressed into the floor. Move your hips around to find a comfortable position., Keeping your shoulder blades pressed firmly to the floor, engage your core and twist your spine to drop your knees to the left side of your body. Keep your movement slow and controlled.Try to maintain the same 90-degree angle between your torso and your thighs as you lower your legs.
You can lower all the way to the ground if you can do so comfortably and maintain correct body position. Otherwise you might want to get a yoga block or folded towel for your knees to rest on.

, After holding the stretch for 15 to 20 seconds, raise your legs back up until they are perpendicular with the floor. Try to keep your knees together, and maintain control over the movement., From the starting position, lower your knees to the opposite side. Hold the stretch for the same period of time, then return back to start. Pay attention to how the stretch feels on each side. Significant differences in range of motion may indicate you have a muscle imbalance on one side.A complete windshield wiper stretch is done from one side to the other. You can repeat the stretch three to five times, holding the stretch for 15 to 20 seconds.
You also can do a more dynamic version of the windshield wiper stretch, in which you drop your legs from one side to the other in a continual movement, synchronizing your breath with the movement. Inhale as you lower your legs, and exhale as you raise them back to start.

, You can alter the positioning of your legs to make the stretch gentler if you have particularly tight hips, or are recovering from a more recent injury.For a gentler stretch, simply let both knees fall together. Flex your feet to protect your knees, feeling the stretch in your hips. Use a yoga block to rest your knees on if you can't lower them all the way to the floor and maintain proper form.
To challenge your hips with a deeper stretch, cross the lower ankle over the top of the outer thigh as you drop your knees over to either side.

Learn to belly dance.The belly roll is just one movement in belly dancing.",How to Belly Roll," Stand facing the mirror with your feet about shoulder-width apart and your back erect. Keep your arms at your sides. Relax your abdominal muscles and let your pelvis naturally stick out a bit. You should feel loose and comfortable.









Since you're doing a belly roll, you'll need to be able to see your belly. Wear a midriff-bearing shirt or just a bra, and comfortable yoga pants, a skirt or shorts that sit below your belly button.;
, Your abdomen is divided into two different sets of muscles: upper abdominal muscles and lower abdominal muscles. Place one hand across your upper abdominal muscles, just below your ribs. Place your other hand over your lower abdominal muscles, just below your belly button. Learning to isolate the two sets is the key to performing a bellow roll.







, A belly roll engages just your abdominal muscles, and the rest of your body should stay still. Don't be tempted to move your hips forward or from side to side; stand completely still and focus on moving those muscles and nothing else.









If you have trouble isolating your abdominal muscles without moving your hips and spine, practice your belly exercise while seated on the floor, lying flat on your back or perched on the edge of the chair. Lean back in the chair and rest on your hands, both legs extended straight in front of you. Hold your torso in a straight line as you practice.

, Let your lower belly pooch out while your upper belly pulls in toward your spine. Hold the position for a moment to get used to the feeling of sucking in your upper abdominal muscles while your lower abdominal muscles push out. This is an essential movement in a belly roll.









Practice flexing and unflexing your upper abdominal muscles. Pull them in, then push them out. Keep doing so until you can easily locate and engage them.
It might help to keep your hand on your abdomen above your belly button so you can feel your muscles tighten and loosen. After trying this for awhile, practice without using your hand.

, Pull your lower belly in toward your spine while pushing out your upper abdominal muscles. This movement is trickier than its reverse, so it's going to take some practice. Imagine pulling your belly button in while the muscles just above stick out.









Practice flexing and unflexing your lower abdominal muscles. Pull them in, then push them out. Keep doing so until you can easily locate and engage them.
Keep your hand on your abdomen above your belly button so you can feel them tighten and loosen. After awhile, do it without using your hand.

, First suck in your upper abdominal muscles, then suck in your lower abdominal muscles. Go back and forth between them, making sure the muscle that isn't being sucked in is pushed out. By rotating between the upper and lower muscles, you'll give the appearance that your stomach is undulating. Once you get the hang of it, you're ready to perform a belly roll.









If you have trouble flexing your upper and lower abdominal muscles in isolation, doing ab exercises can help. Try crunches, sit ups, and other belly workouts to gain greater control over your abdominal muscles.

, This is the basic belly roll that every dancer knows. It goes like this: push your upper abs out, your lower abs out, your upper abs in, and your lower abs in. Practice these motions until you can do them smoothly.








Look in the mirror to see whether your belly looks like it's starting to roll. If you can't tell, try to make your flexes more pronounced and stick out the muscles that aren't being engaged. When you suck in your upper abdominal muscles, really push out your lower belly, and vice versa.

, To do a bottom-to-top belly roll suck your entire abdomen in, then push out with your lower abdominal muscles first. Push out with your upper abs. Suck in your lower abs, and finally suck in your upper abs, too. Repeat.









Practice both this and the top-to-bottom roll; you might find that moving in one direction or the other comes more naturally to you.

, Try to speed up your flexing and unflexing so that as soon as you finish flexing your upper abdominal muscles, you move to the lower. Go back and forth quickly with no interruption. Keep gaining speed until you're rolling as fast as you can. Slow down, then speed back up. This will help you gain greater control over your muscles.








, Like any dance movement, the belly roll requires a good sense of rhythm. Move back and forth between your upper and lower abdominal muscles with a particular pattern, rather than jerking back and forth. Watch your belly in the mirror and try to create a smooth, elegant roll with your muscles.









It helps to move to music. Turn on some music with a good, steady beat and practice rolling your belly with it, just as you'd tap your foot or clap your hands.

, A belly dance includes elegant arm and leg movements as well. Throughout the dance, the spine is held erect and the hips still while the belly undulates. If you enjoy belly rolling, consider taking the next step to learn how to do a complete dance.

Warm up before you stretch.,
Practice for 15 minutes, twice a day.,
Enlist a friend to help you.,
Wear the right clothes.,
Know your limits.",How to Do the Splits in a Week or Less2," It's absolutely essential that you warm up properly before stretching or attempting the splits.









Warming up helps to prevent pulled muscles (which can put you out of action for a while) and will also help you to get a deeper stretch.
You can warm up any way you like, as long as it gets the blood flowing around the body—try doing 5 to 10 minutes of jumping jacks, running around the block, or energetically dancing to your favorite song.

, If you want to achieve the splits in a week or less, you're going to have to really commit to your stretching routine.


You have to practice twice a day, without fail, for about 15 minutes at time. If you can get a third 15-minute session in (without pushing yourself too hard) then that's even better.
Try to accomplish other tasks while doing your stretching to make the time go more quickly. Listen to music, do it while watching TV, or while learning something for school—like spellings or math tables.

, Doing any task is easier when you have a friend there to help you and push you to do better.









A friend can help you to stretch and split deeper by pushing down on your shoulders or legs when you're in position. Just make sure that they'll stop immediately if you tell them to—you need to be able to trust them completely!
You could also try to make it a competition to see who can achieve the splits first—this is good motivation to work harder at your stretching.

, Wearing the right clothes will help you to feel more comfortable and flexible while you stretch, and will also help to prevent clothes from ripping while you're doing the splits.


Wear comfortable athletic clothes that are either loose and baggy, or stretchy and elastic (so they move with your body). Martial arts gear is also a good choice.
One good tip is to wear socks while practicing your splits, as these will allow your feet to slide along the floor more easily, helping you to achieve a deeper stretch.

, Achieving the splits in a week or less is a pretty difficult task, so it's important that you don't push yourself too hard trying to achieve it -- your safety is more important. You will slow yourself down if you are injured. A good rule of thumb is to only stretch mildly if you wake up sore. Wait a whole day or more if you totally bypassed your limits to do any intense stretching. Prevent needing this by taking it slow and always warming up.









While you're practicing the splits, you should feel a good, intense stretch in your muscles, but you should not feel any pain. If you experience pain, this is a sign that you are pushing yourself too hard.
Pushing yourself too hard can lead to strained muscles and other injuries, which will prevent you from achieving the splits anytime soon (if at all).
Remember that it's better to take your time and achieve the splits safely, than it is to rush and hurt yourself.

"
"
Get yourself into position.,
Lower yourself down slowly.,
Relax your muscles.,
Hold the split for 30 seconds.,
Aim for an over-split.",How to Do the Splits in a Week or Less3," After each stretching session, you should spend some time actually practicing the splits. First, get yourself into position:









If you're doing a right or left split, kneel down on the ground and extend your preferred leg out in front of you, with the weight on the heel. Keep your back knee bent so the shin is resting on the ground.
If you're doing a center split, stand up straight and slide your feet out into a wide-legged stance, with your toes and knees facing up at the sky.

, When you're ready, start to slowly and and carefully lower yourself down into your chosen splits position.









Use your hands to support your weight as you lower yourself down. If you're doing a right or left splits, place a hand on the ground on either side of your front leg.
If you're doing a center splits, place your hands on the ground directly in front of you, less than a shoulder width apart.
With most of your weight supported by your hands, spread your legs further and further apart by allowing your feet to slide along the floor. Keep going until your legs are at a 180 degree angle. Congratulations, you're doing a split!

, If you're having trouble getting all the way down, take a deep breath and make a conscious effort to relax all of your muscles.









Studies have shown that relaxation techniques can make a significant difference to a person's flexibility levels, especially if they are incorporated into a regular stretching routine.In addition, letting go of tension in your muscles can decrease your chances of injuring yourself when stretching.

, Once you've accomplished the split position, try to hold it for 30 seconds. It should feel like a deep stretch, it shouldn't be painful. If holding the stretch does feel painful, come out of it immediately and continue with your stretching routine over the next couple of days until you can hold the splits without feeling any pain.








, You may be perfectly happy once you achieve your splits and have no desire to go any further. However, if you want to keep going, it's possible to do an ""over-split"" (where your legs are split at a wider than 180-degree angle).









This is a pretty extreme stretch so make sure you don't push yourself too far too soon. You should be 100% comfortable with the normal splits before you attempt an over-split.
You can train for an over-split by putting a pillow under your front foot (or under both feet if you're doing a center split) once you're in the split position. Over time, you can gradually add more pillows to increase the stretch.

Extend your legs.,
Hang from a pull-up bar.,
Raise your hips.,
Make the windshield wiper movement.",How to Do the Windshield Wiper Stretch2," You can do a transitional windshield wiper exercise from the floor that will help prepare you for hanging windshield wipers. Use this exercise to perfect your form before you add the challenge of gravity.Laying on your back, extend your legs straight upward so that your legs are perpendicular to the floor at a 90-degree angle from your torso.
Slowly lower your legs to one side, back up to start, then to the other side. Keep your legs straight. Focus on keeping your shoulder blades pinned to the floor and your hips stable.

, Advancing to hanging windshield wipers requires significant core and upper body strength. Before you attempt the hanging windshield wiper exercise, be confident dead-hanging from a pull-up bar for several minutes.You also may want to practice lifting your hips so that your body is parallel to the floor. This will help strengthen the abdominal muscles you'll use during the hanging windshield wiper exercise.

, Hanging windshield wipers are done with your torso parallel to the floor. When you first start, you may not be able to lift your torso this high. Just raise your hips as high as you can and still consistently maintain good form.As you raise your hips, raise your feet also. Ideally, your torso will be parallel to the floor and your legs will be at a 90-degree angle from your torso, perpendicular to the floor.
Your arms and shoulders are most important in terms of working the correct muscles and not causing undue strain.

, With slow, controlled movements, move your legs first to one side, back to your starting position, and then down to the other side. Try to maintain the same form as you did when you were doing the same exercise on the floor.Bend your elbows as much as necessary to lessen the pressure on your shoulders. Focus on keeping your shoulders neutral, not crunched in toward your head.

"

Follow up windshield wipers with figure fours.,
Put your legs up the wall.,
Do hip flexor stretches.,
Try pigeon pose.",How to Do the Windshield Wiper Stretch3," The supine (lying face up) figure four is a yoga pose that also stretches your hips. It can be a good pose to incorporate into your routine right after you do the windshield wiper stretch.After the windshield wiper stretch, drop your feet to the floor so that you're lying on your back with your knees up. Make sure your lower back is pressed into the floor.
Raise one leg and turn it so that your ankle is resting on the opposite thigh, just above the knee. Thread your inner arm through your thighs to grasp the lower thigh, and grasp the outside of that thigh with your other hand.
Hold the position for 15 to 20 seconds, then lower your leg to the floor and repeat with the opposite leg. You can do both legs three to five times if you want.

, Don't let the simplicity of this yoga pose fool you. This stretch is good to release muscle tension in your legs and stretch our your hamstrings. Like the windshield wiper stretch, ""legs up the wall"" can help ease lower back pain.For this pose, lie on your back with your legs towards a wall. Scoot up towards the wall so that your hips are as close as possible to the wall itself without resting on it. Your legs should be extended straight up the wall, although your knees can be bent a little. Flex your feet.
Make sure your lower back is flat against the floor. You can put a rolled towel or blanket under your hips if necessary.
Your shoulders should be rolled back so that your shoulder blades are tucked in against your spine, pressing into the floor.
You can stay in this pose as long as you want, breathing deeply. Spread your feet further apart on the wall to stretch your inner thighs.

, When you open up your hip flexors, you aren't stretching your back like you are with the windshield wiper stretch. However, stretching your hip flexors is another way to ease lower back pain by moving your hips to a better alignment.To do these stretches, get down on the floor on one knee, other foot flat in front of you. Your knee should be at a 90-degree angle, while your other leg is in front of you with the knee also bent at a 90-degree angle and your thigh parallel to the floor.
Press your pelvis forward until your gluteal muscles engage. Be careful to keep your back neutral – do not arch your spine and lean forward.
When the glutes engage, they gently open your hip flexors and help press your hips into correct alignment.
Hold this stretch for 15 to 20 seconds, breathing deeply, then switch and do the other side.

, Pigeon pose is perhaps the ultimate hip-opening stretch, and can also relieve stress and tension. However, if your hips are particularly tight, you may have difficulty with this yoga pose. Take your time and don't push into the stretch any further than you can without discomfort or pain.You can get into pigeon pose from all fours. Raise up and walk one leg forward so that your foot is between your hands as you extend your other leg behind you. You are now in a lunge position.
Slide your foot over until your lower leg is roughly parallel with your shoulders and hips in front of you, resting on its side on the floor. Lower your hips until they are resting on the floor – or as low as you can go without any pain or discomfort.
You can keep your torso straight, or fold forward to deepen the stretch. Hold the position for 15 to 20 seconds, then raise back up to all fours and repeat on the other side.

Without moving from the stretched position, isometrically contract the muscle being stretched with about 20% to 50% of your strength for 8 to 15 seconds.,
After 8 to 15 seconds of isometric contraction, relax the muscles and have your partner take the limb slowly through its range of motion a few times.,
Repeat the stretch/contract/relax sequence as desired.",How to Do PNF Stretches to Improve Flexibility," This can be done with brief exercise or massage to the area and is very important. Stretching cold muscles can cause cramps and increase the chances of injury.;
, Your partner will be taking you into the stretches and resisting your strength, so they need to be in a solid stance.

, Keep the limb completely relaxed. This helps warm up the joints and shows your partner how far the limb can move prior to applying the stretch.

, Hold the stretch for 30 seconds.

, Your partner should support you so that nothing moves and no other muscles are contracting but those being stretched. For example, if you're stretching the hamstrings of one leg, your partner should have your calf on his/her shoulder. Your knee should not bend, your back should not lift up or turn, and your opposite leg should not move.

, This allows the muscles to relax and recover for the next repetition.

Pull extreme closures against the head of the penis.,
Grasp the edges to stretch.,
Use two fingers to stretch.,
Perform a frenulum stretch.,
Try stretching in the shower.,
Use a flesh tunnel.,
Avoid forcing the foreskin to retract.",How to Do Phimosis Stretching1," If you have an extreme closure or pinhole phimosis, that means your foreskin ring is extremely tight and small. This is generally the case when you cannot insert fingers inside the foreskin. You will need to stretch the hole wider. Pull your foreskin backwards over the head of the penis as much as possible without any pain. Hold for 30 to 40 seconds, then relax. Repeat around 10 times.Avoid pulling the foreskin ring over the head or using extreme force because this could cause injuries. If the ring slides behind the head, it can get stuck.
Pulling the ring against an erect head may help stretch the foreskin. Doing this in the shower may also help loosen the skin.;
, If you have an open ring but the foreskin is still too tight to place your fingers inside, stretch the skin by holding onto the edges. Use your thumb and index finger to grab the edges of your foreskin on both sides. Apply gentle pressure to spread the foreskin. Hold for around 30 to 60 seconds, and then repeat.Try this for 10 to 20 minutes.

, Once you can fit your fingers inside the foreskin, you are close to having your foreskin stretched an appropriate amount! To keep stretching the foreskin ring, use two fingers to stretch the foreskin. Place your fingers back to back on either side of the inside of your foreskin. Press the backs of your fingers against one another as you gently stretch the skin by pulling in opposite directions. Then relax the foreskin and repeat.Make sure your fingers are clean.
Use your smallest fingers if possible.

, If the foreskin is not long enough, you may need to stretch the frenulum. Take the foreskin where it connects to the frenulum just under the head of the penis between your index finger and thumb. Pull the skin down away from the head of the penis. Hold for 30 seconds.You can stretch this every time you urinate, or you can set aside time during each day.

, Sometimes, stretching your foreskin can be painful and difficult. You may find that using warm water can help make your foreskin easier to stretch. Try soaking in warm bath water or taking a steamy, hot shower. Not only will it help relax you, but the warm water and humidity may help loosen the skin and help it stretch., You may find that you need a little help stretching your foreskin. Flesh tunnels are silicone devices that you can stick into your foreskin and leave. The tunnel helps keep your foreskin stretched for a few hours at a time. Once you can get at least one finger inside your foreskin, you can try a flesh tunnel.You can find these devices online.

, If your foreskin does not move behind the head, don’t force it back. This can cause the foreskin to get stuck behind the head. If this occurs, you should go to the hospital immediately."

Use gentle pressure.,
Try tensing and flexing.,
Perform the stretches regularly.,
Stretch upwards and outwards.,
Stretch the tightest part of the foreskin.,
Be patient.,
Take a break if the skin is irritated.",How to Do Phimosis Stretching2," The foreskin is sensitive, so you should always use care when stretching your delicate skin. If you stretch it too violently or with too much pressure, it can tear and worsen your condition. When you stretch the skin, you should apply a light pressure.The stretch should never be painful. You may feel a slight uncomfortable sensation, but never pain.

, Instead of stretching the foreskin as far as you can go, stretch it back and forth in a steady rhythm. Tense and flex the foreskin by working it back and forth instead of holding it taut in one position., Stretching the foreskin is important, so you should incorporate it into your daily routine. The more often you do the stretches, the more flexible and loose the skin will become. Try doing the stretches once or twice each day.You should perform the stretches for around 10 to 20 minutes each time.

, Instead of pulling the foreskin ring down, pull it up and open. This helps avoid folding it back or getting it stuck around the glans. Stretching the opening outwards helps the opening loosen up., Figure out which part of your foreskin is the tightest. You will have to test the foreskin to determine where this is for you. Whatever the tightest and least flexible part is, that is where you want to focus your stretching., Waiting for your foreskin to loosen can be so frustrating! But remember to be patient. Generally, you will see some changes after around two weeks of stretching every day. Depending on the original state of your foreskin, it may take a month to a year to cure the phimosis., Sometimes, you may overstretch your foreskin or damage it by stretching too forcefully. If this occurs, leave it alone for a couple of days so it can heal. Then, start again, but making sure to be gentle.You may notice puffy or thicker foreskin if you have overstretched.

Go to the doctor.,
Use a prescription topical steroid ointment.,
Consider circumcision.",How to Do Phimosis Stretching3," Seeing a doctor may be necessary if you have tight foreskin that you cannot loosen even after working through your stretches. Most doctors will refer you to a urologist, who will examine you and suggest a treatment for your specific condition.Phimosis can lead to other complications that need medical attention. These complications include irritation, bleeding, difficult or painful urination, ballooning of the foreskin, or urinary tract infections.

, Your doctor can prescribe a topical corticosteroid ointment. This ointment softens the tissue of the foreskin, which helps the foreskin retract more easily.The ointment is used twice each day for around eight weeks, along with manual stretching and retraction.
The doctor will show you how to properly use the ointment.

, Circumcision is when the foreskin is removed medically. This is not a common treatment for phimosis, but in rare cases it may be the proper treatment. This generally is only recommended if the ointment and stretching doesn’t work, if the foreskin is stuck, if there are recurring infections, or if there are other physical problems."

Give your body a chance to heal.,
Elevate your legs.,
Use ice for injuries.,
Try compression.,
Exercise only with care.,
Don't diet when you're injured.",How to Do Leg Workout Rehabilitation for Knee Pain," For a minor injury, take a few days of rest from your activities. Maybe, that's all you need. A severe injury needs more recovery time, and it may require surgery and physical therapy. In this case, you have to check with a physician first, and rest the joint until advised. Avoid stair climbing, squatting, and kneeling whenever possible.;
, Don't sit with knee bent underneath you. Try to sit with the knee almost straight whenever possible. Keep your foot up on the affected side up on a chair. Propping your leg with a pillow in bed aims to limit and reduce swelling.

, Ice reduces inflammation and pain. Use it when appropriate, but no longer than 15-20 minutes at a time. Icing for too long can cause you skin and tissue damage.

, Use a compression bandage which is tight enough to support your knee, and not interfere the circulation. The bandage also gives stability to your knee.

, The knee is the most complex joint in the body. For people who have pain around the knee is very important to keep the muscles strong and tight. Before you start to exercise, check with a physician if exercising is appropriate for you. He or she may advise you to wear a knee brace during your workout to support and protect the joint.


Do gentle range of motion exercises and never go past a safe range of motion. Avoid full squats,and don't ""make"" pain. Here are some exercises: quad setting, closed- knee extension, terminal leg extension, exercise ball wall squat, halfway-down chair squats.
Improving your balance is also very important. For example standing barefoot on a small exercise ball can be very helpful for that purpose .With a foam roller you can release muscle tension in case of Patellar tendinitis.

, Eat enough carbohydrates from fruits, veggies, and grains. Your body will use carbs as fuel and the protein you eat can be used to heal, and repair your muscles. Extra protein will speed muscle repair, so make sure you have 20-30 grams of protein at each meal and snack.


Take also vitamins, minerals, and fish oil. Herbs and spices like: green tee, cocoa, turmeric, ginger, garlic, cayenne pepper, black pepper, cinnamon, and clove have anti-inflammatory properties, and they can help your recovery.

Get your blood pumping.,
Stretch your muscles.,
Breathe as you stretch.,
Create a regular stretching schedule.",How to Do a Wall Split1," Engage in at least 5 minutes of aerobic activity such as biking, jogging, walking, or jump roping. Warming up increases your body temperature and blood flow to your muscles. This allows your muscles to be more flexible and decreases your risk of injury.Never attempt a wall split without warming your body up first. Ten to fifteen minutes of warming up is ideal.
Your warm up routine should engage the same muscles that you will use during your wall split. Jumping jacks, squats, lunges, high knees, and leg swings are good warm up exercises.;
, Once your body is warm, do some static stretching. Static stretching is the form of stretching that you are probably most familiar with. You stretch a muscle or muscle group and hold that positionfor 20 - 60 seconds. Repeat each stretch 2 to 6 times.


Your stretching session should last for 20 to 30 minutes.
Stretch your lower back, hips, groin, hamstrings, buttocks, quadriceps, and calves.Move in and out of each stretch slowly and gently.

, Many people forget to breathe when they stretch. However, proper breathing makes your stretching more effective. Inhale slowly through your nose, hold your breath for a seconds, and then exhale through your nose or your mouth. Your breathing should be slow and relaxed.Your body becomes more relaxed as you exhale so feel free to lean in on your stretch as you are exhaling.Holding your breath as you stretch will cause your muscles to be more tense.

, Regular stretching will increase your overall flexibility and improve your wall splits. Warm up your muscles and stretch every day. If you are consistent, you should reach maximal flexibility in your lower body within two months.If you are older or naturally inflexible, it will take you longer to improve your flexibility.
You should not feel pain as you stretch or the day after you stretch. If you experience this, you are pushing your muscles too hard. Stop your stretching routine until the pain has stopped.Remember that increasing flexibility is gradual process. Only stretch your muscles as far as they are willing to go.

Position your body.,
Open your legs slowly.,
Hold your split.",How to Do a Wall Split2," Lay on your back with your legs facing the wall and your heels resting on the wall. Bend your knees and place your legs against the wall. At the same time, use your arms to move as close as possible toward the wall. Try to get your butt as close to the wall as possible.


If you experience any discomfort in your lower back, move your body away from the wall. You can place a pillow or folded up blanket beneath your lower back for extra support.If your neck feels strained, place a rolled up towel underneath your neck.

, Slide your legs down the wall in the opposite direction slowly until they can go no further. Breathe as you lower your legs.


Press very lightly on your legs with your hands to get a deeper stretch. However, do not press to the point where you feel pain.
You may be able to spread your legs further apart by creating tension and then relaxing your legs. To create tension, pull your legs away from the wall and lift your head and chest. Relax, create tension, and then relax again. Now press lightly on your legs to see if you can widen your split., Hold your stretch for at least 20 to 60 seconds. Once the time is up, use your hands to gently bring your legs back together and rest them against the wall. Repeat this between 2 and 6 times. Remember to breathe as you hold your split.As you continue to practice, try to increase the amount of time you hold your split.
If you are sore the next day, you may have pushed your body too much. Do not practice your splits anymore until the soreness is gone.

Stand with your back against the wall.,
Slide your leg against the wall.,
Hold the position.",How to Do a Wall Split3," Reach your arms over your head, bend at your hips, and place your hands on the floor. Keep your legs straight, but do not lock your knees. Rest your body weight on your hands and your foot that will remain on the ground.Inhale as you reach your arms above your head and exhale as you bend down.
The more flexible you are, the closer your body will be to the wall. If you are not very flexible, position yourself farther away from the wall.
You should always be able to comfortably touch the wall with your foot while your hands and other foot are on the ground., Place the ball of your foot against the wall and slide your leg up the wall. Use slow, controlled movements as you do this. Your arms should be supporting the majority of your body weight.Remember to breathe as you slide your leg up the wall.


Your hips will try to rotate outwards, but keep them in a square position. It may helpful to curl your toes to keep your hips aligned.Push your hands into the ground to help you hold your lifted leg.
Once you are in a stable position, try walking your hands closer towards the wall to get a deeper stretch.

, Hold your position for 5 to 8 breaths. Walk your hands out and slowly bring your leg down. Rest on your knees and then repeat the same steps using your other leg.You may be more flexible on one side of your body. If this is the case, you may need to practice more with that side.
The kneecap of your standing leg should be facing forward. Rotating your knee in this position can cause knee damage.If you begin to feel pain, stop your split and rest. Do not sacrifice good technique to have a more impressive split.

Depending on where you live, you may have your choice of several different gyms so you can choose the one best suited to your goals.Unless you already have one in mind, the easiest way to start looking for obstacle course gyms in your area is to do a simple internet search for ""obstacle course gyms"" coupled with the name of your city or state.
One of your primary concerns may be whether the obstacle course is indoors or outdoors. Indoor obstacle courses can be great for year-round training and general exercise. However, if you're planning on participating in an outdoor race you may get better results training on an outdoor course.
If you're already a member of a regular gym, you may not need an obstacle course gym that has weight training and conditioning facilities. However, if you want to work with a personal trainer at the obstacle course gym (or if you don't have an existing gym membership), those facilities may be a benefit for you.;
, While you may be able to look at photos on the gym's website, you won't get a real feel for whether the facility will work for you until you have the opportunity to visit the gym in person and evaluate the obstacle course itself and other training equipment.It may be beneficial to seek out reviews of the facility and talk to people who are currently members or have attended classes there to find out what they think about it.
If you plan to work with personal trainers at the obstacle course gym, try to speak with them before you sign up for anything. That way, you can get a better understanding of their training or coaching style, their experience, and their reputation in the field.
Try to schedule your tour for the time of day when you plan to visit the obstacle course gym, so you can get a better idea of how crowded it is. If you're planning on going to open gym sessions on your own, ask a staff member about the best times of day to visit.

, You don't necessarily need any specialized clothing or equipment to use an obstacle course gym, but you do need to make sure you're wearing close-fitting attire and shoes with good grip.Especially if the obstacle course is outside, you don't want to invest in a brand-new pair of running shoes – you'll destroy them. Instead, go for a decent pair of trail running or cross-training shoes that has enough tread to maintain traction.
Keep weather conditions in mind as well, particularly if the obstacle course is outside. Choose pieces made of a moisture-wicking fabric. Compression clothing also works well for obstacle courses. Avoid loose or baggy clothes that might get snagged or caught in obstacles or constrict your movement.
If you have longer hair, make sure you have a thick headband or bandanna to control your hair and keep it from getting in your face or getting tangled up in an obstacle.
You also may want to invest in a pair of fingerless gloves, if there are any rope obstacles.

, Some obstacle course gyms host open gym sessions and make the obstacle course available for anyone who wants to train or play on it. Others are more structured, and require a fitness test before you can begin.The fitness assessment test gives the gym and the trainers or coaches who work there a better understanding of where you are right now in your fitness and conditioning, so they can recommend the right classes or training for you.
Some gyms may only allow people who score above a certain level on this test to take more advanced classes.
Even if you're relatively fit, this assessment can help you identify weak areas for you to focus on in your training.

, Many obstacle course gyms offer boot-camp style classes that can help with your training, or just give your regular exercise regimen a little variety and challenge you mentally and physically.A class can be a way to better identify your weaknesses as well as get more familiar with the obstacles and the demands of obstacle-course training.
Taking a group class may be more affordable than getting private training. However, if you're trying to train for a specific event, a group class may not offer everything you need to prepare for your race.
If you just want to use an obstacle course gym to add some variety to your normal workout routine, a weekly class may be the best option for you.

, If you're just going for a new fitness challenge, your conditioning needs will be different than if you're trying to train for a specific obstacle course race, or for some other goal such as joining the military.If you've registered for a race, or plan to register, mark the date of the race on your calendar and figure out how long you have to train. This will help you figure out your schedule and the intensity of your sessions.
Generally, you should sign up for a race far enough out that you have at least six weeks to train – especially if you've never done an obstacle course race before. If you've done an obstacle course race before, you still need at least three weeks of training in preparation for the race.Your goals may be more general if you only want to use an obstacle course gym as part of your overall fitness routine, and have no specific event for which you're training. However, it's still a good idea to identify specific reasons you've decided to use an obstacle course, such as ""improve agility"" or ""develop more explosive power.""

, Intervals best replicate the conditions of a race, so short intervals are the best way to train your body for the kind of explosive power, strength, and endurance you need to run an obstacle course.For example, you might do a strength-training exercise for 30 seconds, then sprint for 30 seconds, then climb or do pull-ups for 30 seconds, then do Burpees for 30 seconds.
Allowing as little rest as possible between your intervals will best simulate the conditions of an obstacle course race.
Look at high-intensity interval training (HIIT) routines to get an idea of the types of exercises that will best condition your body for an obstacle course.

, Obstacle course events typically include intense running, and races can be several miles long. If you've signed up for a specific race, consider the distance when you design your training plan.You should be comfortable running a longer distance than the overall distance of the race without difficulty, since overcoming the obstacles will require additional energy and take a toll on your body.
When running, set your schedule in intervals of sprinting and jogging to best condition your body for the varying speeds you'll need to complete the obstacle course.
Avoid running on a treadmill or on a paved track. Instead, look for a cross-country course or a hiking trail where you can run on varied terrain. Obstacle course races are typically on varied terrain, so while this sort of running will give you a good cardio workout, it won't adequately train you for the type of running involved in an obstacle course race.

, Plyometrics helps build your fast-twitch muscle fibers to increase your explosive power. Since many obstacle courses require a lot of jumping, plyometrics can better condition your body and help with your reaction time.Burpees and jump lunges or jump squats are very basic plyometric exercises that you can incorporate into your training regimen without needing any additional equipment.
Box jumps also are very basic plyometric exercises that specifically train the muscles you'll need for a lot of obstacles on the course. You'll need a sturdy exercise step or box for this exercise.
Even with basic plyometric training, make sure you have at least one rest day between similar workouts to avoid excessive stress on your joints.

, If you've ever watched Ninja Warrior, you know that grip strength plays an outsized role in any obstacle course race compared to other physical activities. You'll need to be able to grab, hold, and navigate many different obstacles of odd shapes and sizes.Pull-ups are the easiest way to build your grip strength. Use a variety of grips, and switch up over-handed and under-handed grips so you can move from one to another easily.
If you have access to a good set of monkey bars (look in public parks and playgrounds), use them as part of your training to practice control and build your grip strength moving from bar to bar.
You also want to practice hanging, both with one hand and with two fingers.Being able to do these will greatly increase your performance on obstacle courses because your grip will be more versatile.
Tie a rope or rolled towel around a pull-up bar and practice hanging from that. This will increase your grip strength as well as simulating to some extent the obstacles you'll encounter, especially if you know ropes will be involved., An obstacle course tests many different aspects of physical fitness, and almost everybody is stronger in some areas than in others. When training and conditioning, spend more time on your weak areas than you do on things that are easier for you.For example, if you are a runner with a strong cardiovascular system and endurance, but you're lacking in strength, you might want to add more strength-training elements to your regimen to build more muscle.
Strength alone doesn't guarantee you'll do well on obstacle courses. The obstacles challenge your body in many ways, and may require movements that aren't easily replicated in normal strength-training exercises. This is one of the reasons people enjoy obstacle course gyms, but it also means that if you've been strength training extensively, you may need to work on your flexibility and agility.
Adding yoga to your regimen can help improve your balance and coordination, as well as your flexibility. Breathing practice and meditation also can help your mental focus, which can be a key factor in obstacle course races.
Practice walking or running along a curb or long beam to improve your balance. Maintain a point of focus ahead of you and engage your core to help your body find its center., Obstacle courses provide an intense whole-body workout, making rest days just as important as training days if you want to effectively build strength and muscle and avoid strain and possible injury.If you've been training intensely for months or even years, you may not need the same amount of rest as beginners. However, when training for an obstacle course race or conditioning to use an obstacle course gym, you still need to make sure you give yourself at least one or two full days of rest each week.
Beginners should probably limit intense training to three days a week. You can engage in walking or light jogging on your rest days, but keep your intensity light to moderate to give your body a chance to adapt and repair itself.
Not scheduling regular race days can mean decreases in performance because muscles are overworked and will fatigue more quickly, which puts you at higher risk for injury.

, The maxim that you have to walk before you can run is no less true when using an obstacle course gym. Attend an open gym session or schedule a private walk-through so you can prepare for the course.Take note of the terrain and the order of the obstacles. This can help you mentally prepare as well as allow you to pinpoint areas where you might have difficulty.
Based on your assessment of your strengths and weaknesses, determine where you need to conserve energy and which obstacles or sections of the course will require more effort for you.
If you have any questions about any of the obstacles, ask a staff member to demonstrate them for you or explain what is necessary to complete that section of the course.

, Even when you're running an obstacle course for general exercise or for training in preparation for an event, adequate hydration is essential for this grueling whole-body workout. You also need to make sure you're eating food rich in carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fat to fuel your body before you hit the course.Drink a lot of water and supplement it with sports drinks to help reduce the risk of cramping. Have a large glass of water within 20 or 30 minutes before you hit the course, and bring water with you so you can stay hydrated while using the obstacle course gym. Within 20 to 30 minutes after you complete the course, have another large glass of water.
Sweet potatoes, squash, and wild rice provide the carbohydrates you need. Stay away from refined foods such as pasta and white rice. A bowl of oatmeal with sliced bananas also is a good pre-course meal. Eat something an hour or two before you plan to hit the obstacle course, so you'll be well-fueled for your workout.For your fuel and hydration needs, think in terms of fueling up for a marathon, half-marathon, or other endurance event – even if you're only going to be at the obstacle course gym for an hour or so.

, If you intend to fully run the obstacle course at an obstacle course gym (and not just play around), a thorough warm-up followed by full-body stretching is essential to get your body ready for an intense workout.A light jog or dynamic exercises such as squats and lunges are a good way to warm up your cardiovascular system.
Include a four- or five-minute yoga routine that incorporates all muscle groups to get loose and limbered up for the obstacle course and get the blood flowing to your muscles.

Try sun salutations, which provide a whole-body series of yoga poses that will warm up and energize your entire body. While there are many variations, the sun salutation generally is a series of seven poses, completed in fluid succession in time with your breathing.A yoga warm-up also can help you integrate your mind and body so you are more focused for the upcoming obstacles.

, Regardless of your reasons for using an obstacle course gym, approach the obstacles the same way you would if you were competing in a race, or if something significant was at stake.Particularly if you're training for an upcoming race, your practices won't be as beneficial if you walk through them or jog lightly from one obstacle to another and complete them only halfway.
Not putting full effort into your actions actually can put you at greater risk of injury – especially if you're not using proper form.
Your drive and focus will propel you to accomplish more than you thought you could do otherwise. Approach each obstacle with optimism and determination.

The many age groups present at a trampoline gym creates an atmosphere that may create distractions for hardcore fitness gurus.;
, As a fun way to exercise, a wide variety of people use trampoline gyms. Thus, trampoline gyms are a great way to transition people who are uninterested in exercise into an exercise routine. Some groups who may especially benefit from trampoline gyms include:


Children and teens.
College students.
Young professionals.
People with joint problems.
Elderly people who do not have bone problems. Elderly people suffering from osteoporosis should exercise caution when visiting trampoline gyms., Finding a trampoline gym might be difficult depending on your region. Thus, it may take you a little work to locate one that is convenient for you. To find a gym:


Search for one on the internet.
Use the Yellow Pages.
Ask friends or fitness experts you know.
Call local gyms to see if they have a section of their facilities dedicated to trampolines., Ultimately, trampoline time should be just one part of your over all work out. While it offers great cardio and limited weight training, it may not provide everything you need to meet your fitness goals. By using it as supplement to other types of training, you'll create an effective routine.


Schedule two visits a week to the trampoline gym. For instance, weight train at a regular gym on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, bounce at a trampoline gym on Tuesday and Thursday, and run or walk on Saturday and Sunday.
Reserve simple cardio and aerobic exercises for the trampoline gym. For instance, save any impact related activity, like jumping jacks, for the trampoline gym.
Think about reserving simple weight training exercises like pushups and sit-ups for the trampoline gym. This way you’ll be able to perform these exercises in a low-impact environment., The basic bounce is perhaps the centerpiece of a trampoline workout. While it is relatively simple, it also burns substantial calories and will help improve your cardio with little effort. To do a basic bounce:


Get on the trampoline (any size).
Position your feet about 6 inches (15 cm) apart.
Make sure your arms are bent and your elbows are at your sides.
Bend your knees slightly.
Jump lightly. You should move about 6 inches (15 cm) into the air.
Complete at least 30 repetitions., Trampoline leg lifts are similar to regular leg lifts but reduce the amount of stress and impact on your joints. They also enable you to stretch your muscles better. To do a trampoline leg lift:


Sit on the trampoline.
Lift your legs off the ground.
Tighten and contract your abs.
Hold your contractions for 20 seconds.
Release your contractions.
Repeat your lifts and contractions 3 times., The power bounce with lateral reach works out not just your lower body, but also helps work out and stretch your arms and shoulders. To complete a power bounce with lateral reach:


Sit on the trampoline.
Quickly stand up and bounce.
Reach one arm across your body. Alternate your arms every bounce.
Return to sitting.
Repeat the sit, stand, reach, and bounce 30 times., Just as pushups are an important part of a regular workout, they are also very important in a trampoline-based workout. Trampoline pushups are a great low-impact activity that will help you improve your upper body strength.


Use a 3 or 4 foot trampoline (.9 meters to 1.2 meters)
Position your feet on the ground.
Plank your body upward and position your hands on the trampoline.
Push up and come back down 10 times., One of the biggest dangers to individual safety at trampoline gyms are multiple jumpers on one surface. As a result, you need to make sure you never jump on a surface where someone is already jumping.


If someone begins jumping on your surface, you should stop immediately and exit the surface.
Inform anyone who wants to jump with you that it is a safety hazard., Jumping without properly inspecting a trampoline is one of the biggest safety failures you can make at a trampoline gym. Because of this, you should use extreme care and look at a trampoline before using it.


Make a quick visual inspection of your trampoline. Make sure there are no tears, rips, or other visible problems.
Make sure no other exercise equipment is under or directly next to the trampoline.
Make sure no one else is getting ready to jump on the same trampoline., While there are several universal rules that most all gyms will adhere to, you need to make sure to thoroughly read gym specific rules.


Take note of posted rules when entering the gym.
Ask gym workers for a printed copy of gym rules. Take a few minutes to go over it.
Be aware that there may be rules posted for each trampoline. For instance, large trampolines with high vertical jumping points may have rules posted at the jumping location.

, While bouncing might be a great option for many people, it presents risks to some groups. As a result, you should consult your doctor before making the trampoline park a substantial part of your training routine.


Elderly people should consult their physician before bouncing, as it may present risks to people with osteoporosis or other musculoskeletal problems.
Talk to your doctor before bouncing if you have any outstanding neck or back problems.
Pregnant women should avoid bouncing.
Discuss bouncing at your annual checkup. For instance, say ""Doctor, I've been thinking about joining a trampoline gym for exercise. What do you think?"""

Throw in a few hair ties or sweatbands.,
Pack all the essential toiletries.,
Keep a towel with you.,
Bring a water bottle.,
Throw in some snacks.,
Don't forget the electronics.,
Remember the sanitizer.,
Don't overlook first aid.",How to Pack Your Bag for the Gym or Health Club," When choosing a gym bag, you want to make sure it has adequate room. Look for bags that have multiple, roomy compartments. You'll want to put your clothes in one compartment, shoes in a separate compartment, and your food in another compartment. If you can find a gym bag with smaller zipped compartments, that's even better. This helps you keep the different items in your bag separated while your bag remains organized., Collect some plastic bags for your various items. This is especially important if you don't have a gym bag with tons of separate compartments. It is important to separate the different items in your gym bag so you don't have things leaking on each other.Get one larger bag to place your shoes in. You don't want your sweaty sneakers getting all over your clothes. Think about getting a shoe bag specifically designed for gym shoes. Placing your shoes in a bag can keep odors and bacteria at bay, saving your entire gym bag from smelling like dirty, sweaty feet.Buy smaller Ziploc bags for toiletries and your underwear. You can pack your clean underwear in the plastic bag to keep it fresh, then place your dirty underwear in the bag after you change.
You can also use the plastic bags for ice in case you have an injury., Start by packing your shoes either on the bottom of your bag or in your shoe compartment. Then pack all your items in your smaller compartments. Next place your toiletries into the bag, then add your towels and clothes on top so they won't get wet if one of your toiletries has a leak. Place any electronics or reading material on top., Mornings are rushed and crazy. Sometimes you oversleep, spend too long in the shower, your breakfast burns, or you end up hitting the snooze button three times. On mornings like this, the last thing you're thinking about is your gym bag. Remove that stress from your morning by packing the bag the night before.Leave the bag by the door or near your briefcase, shoes, keys, or coat. That way, you won't accidentally walk out of the door and leave the bag in your bedroom floor.

, For those days that you do leave that gym bag on the bedroom floor, have a back up bag in your trunk. Keep only the necessities in this bag - a t-shirt or tank top, a pair of workout shorts, socks, an older pair of sneakers, and cheap headphones. This ensures that you never miss your workout., Two key items you must have in your gym bag are a workout shirt and bottom. Make sure the fabric is breathable and well-fitted. Think about what you are going to be doing that day; you wouldn't want your low-hanging pants to slip down when you're doing a squat or your shirt to fall over your face when you're bending over in yoga. Go for quality and usefulness over fashion.Decide if you would like to wear tank tops or short sleeve shirts, along with workout shorts, tights, or pants. It doesn't matter as long as you keep in mind your fitness regiment.
For colder months, pack a jacket and track pants. This is especially essential if you plan on walking out of the gym still wearing your gym clothes.It's a good idea to pack extra underwear, especially if you are going straight to the office. You don't want to put on your nice, clean work clothes over sweaty underwear.Ladies, you might want to pack a sports bra if you're planning on wearing your normal bra to the gym.

, Good shoes are essential for working out. Most gym goers can wear trainers or running shoes. If you are an advanced weight lifter, you may want lifting shoes instead. Regardless of the shoes you wear, make sure you pack them.Trying to run on the treadmill in your work heels or loafers would probably not work very well.


Don't forget the socks. Working out without socks would be gross and painful. Make sure to always have a pair of socks in your bag, even if you have worn a pair to the gym. You never know when your socks are going to slide down in your shoes, get wet, or have something else happen to them. Socks are essential items in your gym bag.Make sure to bring flip-flops. Flip-flops are a must have if you are showering at the gym after your workout. You should never place your bare feet on the shower floor; instead, wear flip-flops to protect your feet from bacteria and fungi., For women, hair ties are necessary for keeping your hair pulled back and out of your face during workouts. For men or women with short hair, headbands or sweatbands can help keep the hair off your face and soak up the sweat., If you are hitting the gym on your lunch hour or before work, you need to make sure your gym bag contains the proper items to help you stay refreshed and professional for the rest of the day. Consider packing the the following:


Deodorant and possibly some kind of body spray or cologne. Just be careful not to overspray the cologne and perfume, especially if you're not showering fully.
Body wash. If you are a guy, you can buy a body wash and shampoo in one for the gym.
Face wash or wipes, and moisturizer to clean your face of all the sweat. You might want to throw in some toner or astringent, too.
Shaving cream and razor. Only pack this one if you're planning on shaving at the gym.
Dry shampoo. This comes in really handy if you don't have time to wash, dry, and style your hair before getting back to work., It is good practice to keep a towel with you. Not all gyms offer towels for free, and though gyms wash them, they might not be the cleanest. To wipe up the sweat from your body or wipe down machines, bring your own towel.

, Hydration is essential when working out. Bring a water bottle so you can refill it as often as necessary. You don't want to be left without a way to hydrate yourself or have to buy an overpriced water at the gym., Pack healthy snacks into your bag for a pre- or post-workout boost. Try nuts, apples, protein bars.Or go for healthy juice, bananas, and nutrition bars.

, No workout is complete without music, so make sure to keep headphones in your bag to hook to your smartphone with its playlist. If you have an iPod or iPod shuffle, keep that in your bag.


You can also pack heart monitors, fitness trackers, and any other fitness equipment you have., Gyms can harbor a lot of germs since you are sharing equipment (and sweat!) with other members. To cut down on germs, bring hand sanitizer with you to rub on your hands afterwards.


An alternate to hand sanitizer is bringing disinfectant towelettes or wipes. You can wipe your hands down, and more importantly, you can wipe the machines and weights down before touching them. Plus, towelettes and wipes won't open in your gym bag and make a mess., Small injuries can easily occur at the gym. Blisters, small cuts, and other abrasions can crop up from using the machines, holding barbells, or doing push ups. Be prepared for these instances by carrying band aids and small bandages in your gym bag."
"
Be realistic.,
Determine how you want to exercise.,
Shop around.,
Try free trials.",How to Save Money on Gym Memberships1," Optimism about their exercise habits often leads people to pay more than they normally would on gym memberships.Because of this, it is important that you are realistic about how often you intend to go to the gym. You should also think about what things might prevent you from going.For example, if you know that you probably will not go the gym regularly, consider paying as you go instead of committing to a yearly or monthly membership.
Consider things like when you like to exercise and how far the gym is from your home and work.;
, If you're interested in classes such as yoga, step, cardio, boot camp, or aquafit, ask about the price before you join. Many facilities allow you to try the first class for free. If you have a specific exercise style or regimen that you are looking to do, find a gym that caters to that, instead of paying a higher price for a large gym full of features you won't use.For example, if you really want to lift weights, look for a gym that is dedicated to strength training.

, Look around online and compare the prices of different gym memberships. This will help you find the most affordable membership. While you are looking around at gyms online, check websites like Groupon, Living Social, and Gilt City for deals on memberships., Call your local gyms and ask for a non-commitment trial. Most gyms will give you a one or two-week free pass to use their facilities. Visit the gyms during the times that you would normally be working out to see what the crowds are like and if you like the facilities. It is better that you try out multiple gyms to find the one that you like instead of paying and cancelling multiple memberships."
"
Look for promotions.,
Talk to your insurer.,
Get a family discount.,
Use a special discount.",How to Save Money on Gym Memberships2," During the year, gyms often offer different promotions intended to bring in customers. The most common promotions occur in January, when people are looking to start their resolutions, and late spring, when folks want to lose some of their winter weight.For example, gyms sometimes offer unique promotions, like getting a cash reward for losing a certain amount of weight., Many health insurance plans in the United States offer discounts for gym memberships. Ask your provider for the details before buying a gym membership, since the deal may be limited to certain facilities.Your insurer may also have a stipulation that you visit a facility a certain number of times each month.
This is less common in other countries, but it doesn't hurt to ask.

, Many gyms offer a family membership, which is often cheaper than signing up each person individually. Family memberships tend to be better deals the larger your family is. You might even be able to negotiate a group membership with some of your friends.Be sure to talk with the sales staff about group and family memberships. Ask them things like “How many people can we include on a family plan?” and “Does everyone on a family plan have to be your family?”

, Depending on your occupation, there may a special discount available for you. If you are a student, you may be eligible for a discount through your school. Many gyms also offer discounts to members of the military. You might also be eligible for a discount through your work or as part of a group package through your employer. Shop around and see what gyms might offer you a unique discount.You might also ask a sales representative things like “Do you offer a military discount?” or “Do you have a student discount?”
If you are a college student, you likely have a membership to your school’s recreation center through your student fees.

"
"
Shop at the end of the month.,
Negotiate your membership.,
Work out during off-peak hours.,
Try to pay as you go.,
See if you qualify for a reduced rate.",How to Save Money on Gym Memberships3," You can get some additional perks by joining a gym at the end of the month when the sales staff is trying to reach their monthly quotas. If you wait until the end of the month, you might be able to get free class passes, personal training sessions, or a discounted membership.Consider using free trials or working out at home until the end of the month.

, When you find a gym that you like, sit down with a member of the sales team and negotiate your membership. Let them know that you have been shopping around that you would like them to meet the fees of their competitors. If they cannot meet the price, ask for things like a free month of membership or if they would be willing to waive the initiation fee.You could also try to negotiate for things like free class passes or personal training sessions.
You might say things like “Gold’s membership is $20 a month less than yours. Can you meet that?” or “Since you won’t lower your monthly fee, can I get some free class passes?”

, When you are negotiating, ask about a discount for using the facilities during off-peak hours. If it works for your schedule, you may be able to use the gym at certain times for a discounted price. You will likely need to bring this up while negotiating since these rates are rarely advertised.For example, you might get a discounted rate for working out early in the morning, late in the evening, or in the middle of the work day.
Make sure the off-peak hours fit into your workout schedule. Shifting to a less convenient time can throw you off your fitness plan. It's worth it to pay full price if it means you'll actually visit the gym.

, Although paying for a yearly or monthly membership might appear to be a better deal, in the long-run, paying each time you go to the gym may save you money. Most people do not work out enough to make a monthly or annual membership affordable. Unless you have a history of regularly working out, a pay as you go approach may be the most cost effective.It may be best to pay as you go until you have developed a regular workout routine. Establish a regular workout regimen and then look into a membership. Most members do not go to a gym and many people quit their workout regimens after a few weeks.
Think of how the seasons fit into your exercise regimen. If you are an active cyclist, you may only need gym membership during the winter. If you want to get in shape for the skiing season, consider buying a membership just for the fall.

, Some gyms, like the YMCA, offer reduced fees based on things like your income, age, and family size. When you go to sign up, check to see if you are eligible for any type of discount. They will determine your rate using a sliding scale based on things like your household income and size."
"
Read your contract.,
Look for changes in the fees.,
Drop what you do not use.",How to Save Money on Gym Memberships4," Before you join a gym, make sure that you read the fine print on your contract. If you cancel your membership, you do not want to pay a large cancellation fee or be stuck paying for a membership that you never use. If you catch these fees ahead of time, you may be able to negotiate your way out of them., Once you become a member, keep any eye on your gym's membership fees. If you see that the price of your membership is discounted, ask if you can receive that discount. Your gym may be willing to give you a lower rate.For example, if you are paying an $80 a month gym membership and see that it is now only $60, ask if you can receive the reduced price.
You might say something like, “I see that the rate for my membership went down. Am I eligible for that discount?”

, If you find that you signed up for classes or sessions that you are not using, get rid of them. It is better to ditch things that you are not using rather than paying for them. Instead, consider paying for individual sessions or take advantage of free trials.For example, if you are paying to swim in the pool but rarely use it, drop the pool and only pay for it when you use it.

Research the other gyms in your area.,
Identify your competitive advantage and use it in all marketing and verbal communication.,
Find the right demographics for your gym.,
Target your demographics seasonally.,
Realize that selling gym memberships to long-term patrons is more important than to trial members.,
Get your gym in the news.,
Do the comparison of the gyms for your customers.,
In many cases, other gyms would offer lower rates; however, they may offer fewer classes, overloaded classes, binding contracts, fewer spa services or fewer locations.

,
Establish flexibility.",How to Sell Gym Memberships," Find the services that they provide along with the costs that are associated with joining. Only after you figure out the finer details of their plans can you truly compete with the competition, because you will be able to find your competitive advantage.


Sign up for other gyms' mailing lists, catalogs, promotions and more. Not every gym offers these promotions, but they may also have social media pages that let gym members know the important changes and specials they are offering.;
, This could be anything from pilates classes, to a lack of an introductory fee to free personal training sessions. Try something that other gyms aren't trying and promote it.

, For example, if your gym has a pool or a sauna, you may want to cater to an older crowd to appreciate the low-impact experience of water-based activities. These customers may not be reached through email, and direct marketing postcards may yield better results.


Target new arrivals to the neighborhood. Offer 7-day passes to people who register nearby. Lists may be available from your local post office or other marketing agencies to help you keep abreast of people who are moving in.

, New year promotions are important, since most gyms see a spike in gym attendance and sign up after people have new year's resolutions. However, you can also take advantage of holidays, good weather and couples memberships.

, Many sites offer coupons or trial memberships; however, if you can entice loyalty in your members, their renewals will save more money than finding new business.

, Ask your seasoned staff members to write blogs or articles that will work along with other promotions. Your sales staff should be supported by a marketing department that takes advantage of print, social media, online articles, weight loss support and more.


Some people suggest that the gym name must be in the news or in the general public's perception in at least 7 ways in order to be attractive to the gym consumer.

, Create an attractive table that outlines fees versus the benefits of joining each gym. Many of your potential customers are busy and would appreciate the comparison work being done for them.

,, In today's market, more people are willing to barter than ever before. Take this into account when you send your sales people out to talk with prospective clients.


Consider lower fees, non-binding contracts, easy billing, shorter contracts, perks, personal training sessions and more as ways to entice people to join.

Look for instructions.,
Find the adjustments.,
Adjust the machine so your joints line up with the pivot points of the machines, your legs (if sitting) are flat on the floor, and the pads rest comfortably against your limbs.

Choose a weight that's not too heavy, so you don't run the risk of injuring yourself if you find you can't complete a repetition.,
Lift the weights slowly, concentrating on keeping the proper form and exhaling during the lift.,
Avoid letting the weight clang against the rest of the stack at the end of the repetition, because this annoys others.

",How to Use Gym Equipment1," Most machines have a short set of instructions and illustration affixed to them.;
, The machines' seats and benches adjust to the height of the user, and you can adjust moving parts to accommodate your leg or arm length.

,, If you can complete ten repetitions easily, choose a slightly heavier weight.

, Don't adjust your position to lift the weight because you will not get the full benefit of the machine, and you may injure yourself.

Dry your sweat from the bench when you're done.

",How to Use Gym Equipment2," Because you don't have a weight machine to help you maintain the proper form, you have to pay careful attention to how you lift the weight.

, If you can't lift and lower the weight slowly and smoothly, choose a lighter weight.

, If you can't complete the last couple of repetitions, you could find yourself trapped under a barbell or straining your muscles in an attempt to maintain control. A spotter will help you lift the weight safely so you can finish your set. You can often ask another member to spot you in return for being his or her spotter.

, Make sure you have the same weight on each side and that they're secured with collars.

, Both dumbbells and plates are racked in order of weight.

Dress for comfort.,
Flatter your natural figure.,
Use sweat-absorbing accessories.,
Have good gym hygiene.,
Make the most of your stretches.,
Pick achievable exercise goals.,
Know which exercises flatter specific body parts.,
Use proper form.,
Don't rest at your machine.",How to Look Good At the Gym1," When it comes to picking your clothes for working out, comfort is king. Picking fabrics that allow you to move, bend, sweat, and lift comfortably is always a smart idea — if you feel better at the gym, you'll look better. Rather than relying on stuffy materials like denim, vinyl, polyester, and so on, pick breathable materials like cotton, bamboo, and artificial fibers designed for athletic wear to keep cool and comfortable while you work up a sweat.""Moisture-wicking"" fabrics are an especially great choice for workout wear. These fabrics (which are usually artificial) transfer sweat to the outside of the fabric where it can evaporate, rather than trapping it against your body.
When in doubt, layer. Wear several pieces of breathable clothing on top of each other and remove the outer items as you heat up and begin to sweat.;
, When you're at the gym, you have a little more freedom than normal for how tight or revealing your clothes can be. Make the most of this! For example, if you're a woman who's naturally curvy, a well-fitting sports bra and curve-hugging yoga pants can accentuate your natural assets. On the other hand, if you're naturally thin, you may want to go for a bare midriff to show off your toned midsection. Your ideal outfit will vary based on your body type — everyone's a little different!


One sure-fire way not to flatter your figure is to wear a one-color outfit — this can give almost anyone a ""saggy"" look (as if they're wearing pajamas). A much safer bet is to wear one neutrally-colored garment (black, grey, etc.) and one colored one — this creates healthy contrast, highlighting your figure.

, Some people who have a tendency to sweat a lot may find it beneficial to wear items of clothing that absorb sweat. Headbands, wristbands, ankle bands, bandanas, doo-rags, and other accessories can help keep sweat levels manageable, ensuring you look your best while you work out.


For added effect, you may also want to consider wearing an antiperspirant deodorant to minimize the amount that you sweat and keep body odor low.

, Looking attractive at the gym isn't all about the clothes you wear — it's also about the way you act and carry yourself. For instance, because any hygiene issues you have are likely to be especially noticeable once you start moving and sweating, it's important to take care of these issues both for your own benefit and that of the people around you. Below are just a few basic hygiene tips to keep you looking and feeling great at the gym:Clean your skin skin and hair daily or every other day.
Bathe after every time you use the gym.
Cover any cuts, scrapes, or sores with a suitable bandage.
Wipe up excessive sweat with disinfectant after you finish exercising.

, For many, stretching before and/or after exercise is a chore. If you're trying to look hot, however, this is your greatest opportunity! Stretching gives you the perfect opportunity to bend, twist, and contort in ways that flatter your figure. Don't be ashamed — there's no reason not to look as good as you can while you limber up.


If your gym offers yoga classes, consider enrolling. A major component of yoga is flexibility, so you'll be doing lots of stretches, some of which are naturally flattering. On top of this, tight-fitting clothing is fairly common for yoga classes.

, Let's be honest — most people don't look sexy when they're struggling to complete difficult exercises. Whether you're trying to max out on one more bench press rep or finish the last quarter-mile of your half marathon, there's a good chance you'll be a sweaty, grunting, panting mess. To look as good as possible, pick exercise goals you know you won't have to seriously struggle to complete. Finishing your exercise with a healthy level of effort usually makes you look great; barely crawling across the finish line or giving up on your last rep does not.


This doesn't necessarily mean you should shy away from high-intensity exercise, however. If you want to look good, you'll need to strike a careful balance between picking exercises that are too easy — which can make you look like you're barely even trying — and those that are too hard.

, Do you have one area of your body that you're particularly proud of — an area that's extra-hot? If so, show it off! Below are just a few potential ""target"" areas and some exercises that can highlight them:


Arms: Bicep curls, tricep extensions, forearm curls
Glutes: Squats, dead lifts
Legs: Squats, lunges, running, cycling
Chest: Bench press, flies, incline/decline press
Stomach: Crunches, situps
Back: Pull ups, rows

, No matter how attractive you naturally are, you'll look like a gym newbie if you use improper form for the exercises you attempt. More importantly, using improper form can be unsafe, potentially leading to long-lasting injuries. To avoid this, ensure you tackle each exercise with perfect form and posture. If you're unsure of how to perform a certain exercise safely, talk to a staff member at the gym. Since there are nearly countless exercises that are possible at the gym, this topic is impossible to cover in-depth in this article, but here are just a few basic form and posture tips to start with — this list is by no means complete:When weightlifting, use only as much weight as you are able to lift and lower smoothly and comfortable.
Keep an erect, upright posture when standing, sitting, and moving, but don't lock your knees.
Don't rush or push yourself beyond your limit.
Don't use a hunched or stooped posture of the neck and back, especially when exercising these muscles.

, This is a common gym annoyance that's super-easy to forget about, but it can be a minor turn-off for other members if you're caught doing it. Resting at a cardio or strength-training machine is often seen as bad form (especially by ""gym rats"") because it keeps other people from using the machine unless they specifically ask you to move. This can make you look like a gym newbie or someone who's selfish, so avoid it if you can remember to do so.


Instead, take a break between your sets by standing up, walking around, and, if desired, stretching. If you plan to resume your exercise at your machine, leave your bag or another personal possession next to it — this is a way of ""claiming"" it without preventing others from squeezing in a quick set.

Don't forget the shoes.",How to Look Good After the Gym," If you can't shower, the next best thing is to dry off. It will help you look less sweaty, but it will also help you smell better, too, as you won't be drenched in your own sweat. Just make sure to hit all the major sweaty spots, including your underarms.Of course, the best option is to shower if you can, so you can start fresh with your look.;
, Baby wipes or other body wipes are also a quick way to freshen up. Use them to wipe down areas where you're particularly sweaty, including your underarms and any other place that needs it. Don't forget to add some deodorant., Baby powder is a great way to freshen up. It helps dry you off, as well as keep you dry after the gym, making you look less sweaty. In addition, it gives you a subtle, fresh scent so that you won't be quite so smelly.Sprinkle some on your feet or in your shoes, too, to help take care of odor.

, Even if you don't have time to shower, washing your face is a good idea. If you leave the sweat on your face, it can clog your pores, making you break out. You can use a facial cleansing cloth if you don't have time to stop and wash your face., If your hair is long, try to put it up while you work out. That keeps it out of some of the sweat (on your neck), plus you can use the time to create a look for after the gym. If you make a loose braid and tie it up in a bun, you can simply wash it as is afterwards if you have time to shower, then pull it down for a wavy look.This technique works best if you don't sweat too much.
Hair coils work well to put up your hair because they don't leave a crease.You can also use ribbon hair ties for less crease., One option, of course, is to use a hair dryer. Many gyms even provide hair dryers to use. You can also comb in dry shampoo or baby powder to help dry off your hair. Either way, you need to cut down on the sweat to help yourself look fresh.Another technique is to use dry shampoo on your roots before you work out, as it can help control your sweating., One way to look great after the gym is to create an easy hairdo like a messy bun or a loose braid. You can do these hairdos in just a few minutes, and they take advantage of your messiness to create a fun look.For a messy bun, pull your hair up into a ponytail. On the last loop, only pull your hair partway through. Scrunch it and pull it to create a messy bun.

, Another option is to just brush your hair out when you're done. If you've dried your hair off, paying a little attention to the shape as it dries, brushing may be all you need to do to create a nice look post-workout., If your hair is a bit out of control, you can try a few techniques. You can use dry conditioner on the ends to help it calm down. For a more down-to-earth approach, try running a dryer sheet over it to control fly-aways., After you work out, just apply a few of the basics for makeup. You'll have a natural glow from your workout, so you don't need much. Instead, stick to a basic lipstick and a touch of mascara, and you're good to go., To keep things smelling fresh, add a little perfume. You can even spray a bit in your hair, which if you've sweated, can pick up an odor. Hair perfume is a great solution, which many salons sell., One option for after the gym is to stay casual. For instance, if you wore a sports bra and leggings to the gym, you can throw on a casual shirt, such as a crop top, over your sports bra to finish running errands., Another option is to simply take a change of clothes with you. It can be casual or chic, depending on what you need to do afterwards. Plus, it will leave you feeling a lot fresher if you can change into clean duds., If you're creating a post-gym look, the shoes can help make the statement. Even if you're staying casual in your gym clothes, switching to a trendier pair of shoes can help pull the look together. With a more dressed-up look, you're obviously going to want different shoes than the ones you worked out in."

Use a sports bra.,
Wear either loose tops or close-fitting athletic wear.,
Wear shorts or exercise pants.,
Don’t wear see-through materials.,
Don’t wear makeup.,
Don’t wear your hair loose.,
Don’t wear jewelry.,
Bring a functional bag.",How to Look Good At the Gym2," One good rule of thumb for women looking to perform heavy exercise is to invest in a comfortable, properly-fitted sports bra. Sports bras provide excellent breast support and prevent unwanted bouncing, making them especially valuable for activities like jogging, running, jumping rope, and so on. However, a sports bra has to fit properly to be beneficial — one that's too tight or loose will be uncomfortable and may not look as good.


The benefits of sports bras aren't only in the way you look — some sports bras can provide additional comfort during exercise by wicking sweat away from the body, keeping you cooler. Some modern sports bras even have space for storing your belongings!, Women have many options when it comes to choosing a top for the gym — generally, both loose-fitting shirts (like tees) and tighter athletic wear are perfectly acceptable. If you're especially interested in looking good, you may want to consider wearing layers (such as wearing a track jacket over an inner tee or tank top) and pairing your colors accordingly, though this is by no means required.


If these items aren't prohibited by your gym's dress code, you may also want to consider more revealing tops (like halter tops, etc.) if they're more breathable or comfortable for you. However, these sorts of tops aren't essential to have for a good workout.

, Women also have a great deal of variety when it comes to the bottoms they can wear — sweats, yoga pants, tights, athletic shorts, and so on are all acceptable, so pick the option that's most comfortable to you. Generally, shorts are cooler than pants, so they're especially well-suited to cardio activities that may cause you to sweat a lot.


If you're worried about embarrassing sweat marks on your pants, wear a dark color like black or navy blue for your pants — sweat won't appear much darker than the fabric itself on these items.

, When you're worried about how you look, it's easy to forget that sweating at the gym is a good thing — it means you're working hard! However, a lot of sweat can turn some clothes (especially white clothes) semi-transparent. This can lead to embarrassing over-exposure, so try to wear darker colors or thicker fabrics to counter this effect if you expect to sweat a lot.


If you have to wear thin white fabric to the gym, for obvious reasons, you will want to be extra-sure to wear a bra.

, Generally, you'll want to skip your makeup before you go to the gym. Heavy makeup can be uncomfortable to wear during exercise, especially if you start sweating while you're wearing it. Even worse, sweat can cause your makeup to run, giving it a smudged, messy appearance. Since you should typically be going to the gym to work hard (and not to show off), the benefits of makeup usually don't make it worth it.


Believe it or not, wearing makeup while you workout can also make you look worse in the long-term. Makeup can clog your facial pores while you sweat, leading to pimples, blackheads, bumps, and other blemishes that take time to go away., If you have long hair, letting it hang free while you exercise can sometimes be a problem. Loose hair can fall in front of your face while you run or play sports, impeding your vision and acting as a minor annoyance (not to mention giving you a messy, untidy look). Although rare, loose hair can also occasionally catch in certain types of exercise equipment (like weightlifting machines), resulting in serious injury. To avoid these problems, use a functional, tidy hairstyle like a ponytail or bun to keep your hair secure.


If you don't want to bother fussing with your hair, another option is to use accessories like hair ties, bandanas, and hair wraps to keep it tied up. These also give you the opportunity to get creative with your fashion style!

, Like loose hair, excessive jewelry can sometimes be a liability at the gym. While small, discrete stud earrings and rings aren't usually a problem, hoop earrings, bracelets, necklaces, and ankle bands can be dangerous if they make it hard for you to exercise properly or get caught in your equipment. The smartest policy is usually to leave these things at home — not only will you not have to worry about them, but you'll also avoid looking like someone who's more interested in their glamor than their workout.


Another reason you may want to avoid bringing jewelry to the gym is the possibility of theft. If you leave your jewelry in a public locker room, there's a possibility it may be stolen, even if you use a lock. Leaving your valuables with the front desk is a wiser choice, but the only fool-proof way to keep your jewelry from getting lost or stolen is to leave it at home.

, An overflowing, stuffed-to-the brim purse can be like a ball-and-chain at the gym — not only is it a constant hindrance to your exercise routine, but also a yet another item you'll need to worry about losing or getting dirty. If you need to bring a bag, try using a small, functional sports bag. These usually offer more storage space than purses anyway and usually look fine even when they're dirty or sweat-soaked.

Wear a comfortable, breathable top.,
Err on the side of longer shorts.,
Don’t take off your shirt.,
Don’t grunt or scream.,
Don’t show off unneeded gear or accessories.",How to Look Good At the Gym3," Compared to women, men have almost all of the same options for gym tops available (with the obvious exceptions of halter tops, etc.) Men at the gym look best in tops that are functional, comfortable, and breathable. Many men choose to wear ordinary cotton tee shirts, though, as always, modern moisture-wicking fabrics are an even more comfortable choice and usually look great as well.


If you want to show off your arms, you also have the option of wearing an A-frame tee (tank top) or a sleeveless tee. These types of shirts sometimes even come with long slits along the sides to give a view of your abs and lats — though this style is sometimes considered ""bro-y"", it provides great ventilation and is not usually prohibited in gym dress codes.

, Generally, it's a little less acceptable for men to wear very short shorts to the gym than it is for women. Showing upper thigh can be considered a fashion faux pas unless a man is on a cross country team, so, if you typically wear shorts, it's usually best to opt for longer styles. Even shorts that hang past most men's knees aren't usually considered too baggy, so don't feel any need to shy away from longer styles.

, While some men like to take off their shirts to cool down during a long jog or while playing sports, it's sometimes considered rude to do so at the gym. At gyms where this isn't common, taking off your shirt can make you look like a vain ""meathead"" in comparison to the other people exercising. In addition, if you get very sweaty when you exercise, removing your shirt can cause you to leave behind more sweat where you work out, which can gross out others.


However, it's definitely worth noting that some men swear by the act of exercising shirtless, claiming it as a powerful motivating factor.If you're unsure whether it's considered rude to exercise shirtless at your gym, talk to the staff or simply observe the other members for a few days.

, Like taking off your shirt, letting out excessive noise while you exercise (especially while you lift weights) can make you appear vain or attention-seeking. It's also somewhat disrespectful of the people around you, for whom the extra noise may be somewhat awkward or intimidating. While some grunting may be unavoidable during heavy exercise, try to avoid loud grunts or screams to avoid giving the wrong impression of yourself.

, The gym is for playing sports and exercising — not playing games of equipment one-upsmanship with other gym members. While it's perfectly acceptable to bring gloves, headbands, accessories, reading material, music playing devices, and anything else that makes your workout more comfortable or productive, these accessories shouldn't be a point of pride in and of themselves. Having a great workout is the focus of your visit to the gym — everything else should just be a tool to help you achieve this.


One recent gym trend is the use of elevation training masks during exercise. These masks partially restrict the flow of oxygen into the lungs as the wearer trains, supposedly simulating the effects of training at a high altitude where oxygen in the air is limited. Though some claim great results, there is little (if any) evidence to support the claim that these devices make your lungs use oxygen more efficiently, making them not only a bizarre fashion choice, but also a likely waste of money.

Warm up.,
Use a cardio station.,
Do some body curls.,
Try some bench dips.,
Use the pull-up station.,
Do some step-ups.,
Walk the balance beam.",How to Use an Outdoor Gym2," Before you being your exercise routine, you should warm up your body properly. You can do this by walking, jogging, or biking to the park. If the park is too far away for you to get there on foot or bike, you can also perform these activities once you arrive at the gym. Warming up will ensure that your muscles are ready for more intense exercise and prevent injury.



Jog for 20 to 30 minutes or take a brief 1 to 2-mile (1.6 to 3.2 km) run around the park before you begin your workout routine.
A brisk 20 to 30 minute walk should adequately warm up your legs and lower body.

, Depending on the equipment available at your gym, you may have access to various cardio stations like a cardio walker, elliptical station, or an upright cycle. These machines are great for warming up and getting some cardiovascular exercise. The benefit of these machines is that they will help warm up your upper body and not just your legs.If you are beginning a new workout routine, consider only using one of the cardio stations for a few minutes. Increase the amount of time spent on warming up as you get in better shape.

, Most outdoor gyms will have a body curl or sit-up station. This will look like an uneven bench with a handle on the higher end. In order to use the station, lie on the bench with your head towards the bar and grab the bar with both hands. Keep your legs straight and use your core to lift your heels off the bench.Initially, try to do two sets of five curls and, as you get in better shape, you should increase the number of the number of curls and sets.

, Another common piece of exercise equipment in an outdoor gym is the bench dip. This piece of equipment is a short bench with two sets of bars at different heights. Grasp the set of bars that you feel the most comfortable with, keeping your feet straight out in front of you. Bend your elbows to lower yourself down to the seat without touching it. Then raise yourself back up, keeping your heels on the ground.If you are a beginner, try to do one to two sets of 10 to 12 dips. If you are a more advanced exerciser, consider three sets of 15 to 20 reps.

, Possibly the most common workout station in an outdoor gym, the pull-up or chin up station helps you strengthen your arms, shoulders, back, and core. Simply grab the vertical bar or hand holds with both hands and pull yourself up towards the bar. If you are unable to do a traditional pull-up, the station may also have a reclining pull-up bar.Because pull-ups are more difficult, you may only be able to do a few at first. If you are a beginner, consider using the reclining pull-up bar at first and work your way up to the regular bar.
Start with two sets of 10 to 15 reps and work your way up to four sets of 15 to 20 reps.A more advanced outdoor gym may have a back pull down station. This piece of equipment uses your own weight as resistance and works many of the same muscle groups as a traditional pull-up., Building leg strength is an important part of staying healthy and preventing injuries. Your outdoor gym may have some platforms or steps for you to do some step-ups. For a step-up, alternate stepping up onto the step platform as if you are going up a flight of stairs. This is a great resistance and cardio workout.Start with two one-minute sets and work your way up to two three-minute sets.
A more advanced outdoor gym may have resistance equipment like leg press machines that strengthen your legs using your own weight.As you get more comfortable with the stepping, you might consider trying plyometric jumps if boxes are available at the gym., Working on your balance is a great way to strengthen your core. If your outdoor gym has a balance beam, walk along the beam while maintaining upright posture. Try not to fall off the beam and walk with controlled steps.As you get more comfortable on the beam, slow down your steps and practice walking heel to toe for a better workout.

Take a brief walk or jog.,
Stretch at the end of your workout.,
Try some basic yoga poses.",How to Use an Outdoor Gym3," Once you have completed your workout, take a quick walk or jog to help cool down your muscles. Walk or jog around the park for 10 to 15 minutes. This will help your muscles stay warm and keep them from tightening too much.Walking, jogging, or riding your bike home is also a great cool down exercise.

, Your outdoor gym may have a stretching station consisting of a vertical bar with two handles attached to it. Use the station to balance you as you stretch. Slowly stretch your muscles, holding each position for at least 15 seconds. Make sure that you focus on loosening the muscles that you used during your workout.For example, be sure to stretch your legs after doing a leg-intensive workout. Emphasize movements that stretch your hamstrings and calves.
If the gym does not have a stretching station, you can still perform all of the stretches on your own.Avoid any jerking or bouncing movements while your stretch. This can lead to injury.

, A few basic yoga poses are a great way to stretch out your muscles and relax after a workout. Positions like upward-facing dog, downward-facing dog, and child’s pose will stretch and loosen your muscles, while the controlled breathing will help your body relax. Incorporate some yoga poses into your stretching routine to get a physical and mental cool down after your workout."

The following stretching routine is tailored specifically to the purpose of achieving the ability to perform both front splits and side splits.,
Don't forget to warm-up your body before performing any of these exercises.,
Perform these stretches at your own risk!,
The details on how to perform each of the stretches are discussed in the following sections.,
As with all stretches, you should not stretch to the point of intense pain!,
Lower Back Stretches


These stretches work mostly the lower back, but also make some demands on your abdominal, and your external obliques (sides).,
Lying Buttock Stretch


This mainly stretches your buttocks (gluteal muscles) but also makes some demands on your groin and upper inner-thigh area.,
Groin and Inner-Thigh Stretch


This mainly stretches your groin and upper inner-thigh area, but also makes some demands on your lower back.,
Seated Leg Stretches


These include three different stretches performed for the calves, hamstrings, and inner-thighs, but they are all performed in very similar positions and I do all three stretches (in the order given) for one leg before performing them for the other leg.,
Seated Calf Stretch




With your leg extended directly in front of you, face your leg and bend it slightly.,
Seated Hamstring Stretch




Now that our calf is stretched, we can get a more effective hamstring stretch (since inflexibility in the calf can be a limiting factor in this hamstring stretch).,
Seated Inner-Thigh Stretch




You should still be sitting on the bench with your outstretched leg in front of you.,
Psoas Stretch


This stretch is sometimes called the runner's start because the position you are in resembles that of a sprinter at the starting block.,
Quadriceps Stretch


For this stretch you will need one (or two) pillows or soft cushions to place between your knee and the floor.,
Lying `V' Stretch


This stretch is very good for working toward a side (Chinese) split (see section The Side Split).",How to Work up to the Splits," It consists of the following exercises:


Lower Back Stretches
Lying Buttock Stretch
Groin & Inner-Thigh Stretch
Seated Calf Stretch
Seated Hamstring Stretch
Seated Inner-Thigh Stretch
Psoas Stretch
Quadriceps Stretch
Lying `V' Stretch;
, See section General Warm-Up.

, I cannot be held responsible for any injury which may result in you performing any of these exercises! See section Disclaimer.

, Each section describes how to perform a passive stretch, and an isometric stretch, for a particular muscle group. On a given day, you should either perform only the passive stretches, or perform only the PNF stretches, in the order given (see section Types of Stretching). If you perform the PNF stretches, don't forget to rest 20 seconds after each PNF stretch, and don't perform the same PNF stretch more than once per day (see section PNF Stretching). The isometric stretches described do not require the assistance of a partner, but you may certainly use a partner if you so desire. The order in which these exercises are performed is important because the entire routine attempts to employ the principle of synergism by stretching a muscle fully before using that muscle as a ""supporting muscle"" in another stretch (see section Exercise Order)., A tolerable amount of discomfort should be more than sufficient. You do not want to pull (or tear) your muscles, or be very sore the next day.

,






Lying down with your back on the floor, straighten one leg, while bending the knee of the other leg, and try to bring the thigh of your bent leg as close as possible to your chest. Hold it there for 10-15 seconds. Then cross your bent leg over your straight leg and try to touch your knee to the floor (while trying to keep both shoulders on the ground). Repeat this same procedure with the other leg. Then, bend both knees and bring both thighs up against your chest (keeping your back on the floor). Hold that for 10-15 seconds. Then, put both feet on the ground but keep the knees bent. While trying to keep both shoulders on the ground, roll your legs over to one side and try to get your knees to touch the floor beside you. Hold for about 10-15 seconds and then do the same thing on the other side. Now repeat the same stretch, but this time begin with your feet off the floor so that your leg is bent at the knee at about a 90 degree angle.
As for isometric stretches for the back, I don't recommend them.



, You must be very careful not to apply any stress to the knee joint when performing this stretch. Otherwise, serious injury (such as the tearing of cartilage) may occur.

Lie on your back again with both knees bent and in the air and with your feet on the floor. Take your right foot in your left hand (with your hand wrapping under your foot so that the fingertips are on its outside edge) and hold your leg (with your knee bent) in the air about 1–3 feet (0.3–0.9 m) above your left breast (relax, we haven't started to stretch the buttocks just yet). The leg you are holding should be in much the same position as it is when you start your groin stretch in the next exercise, only now it is in the air because you are on your back (see section Groin and Inner-Thigh Stretch). Exhale and slowly pull your foot over to the side and up (toward your head) as if you were trying to touch your outstretched leg about 12 inches (30.5 cm) to the outside of your left shoulder. You should feel a good stretch in your buttocks about now. If you feel any stress at all on your knee then stop at once. You are probably pulling ""up"" too much and not enough to the side. You may wish to use your free hand to support your knee in some way. Hold this stretch for about 20 seconds (and stop if you feel any stress in the knee joint). Now repeat this same stretch with the other leg (using the other hand). Remember that the leg you are not holding should have the sole of its foot on the floor with the knee bent and in the air.
To make an isometric stretch out of this, when you are performing the passive stretch (above) and feel the stretch in your buttocks, continue trying to pull your foot to the outside of your shoulder while at the same time resisting with your leg so that it pushes against your hand. No actual leg motion should take place, just the resistance. Stop immediately if you feel any undue stress to your knee.



, It is often called the butterfly stretch or frog stretch because of the shape that your legs make when you perform it.






Sit down with your back straight up (don't slouch, you may want to put your back against a wall) and bend your legs, putting the soles of your feet together. Try to get your heels as close to your groin as is comfortably possible. Now that you are in the proper position, you are ready to stretch. For the passive stretch, push your knees to the floor as far as you can (you may use your hands to assist but do not resist with the knees) and then hold them there. This can be hard on the knees so please be careful. Once you have attained this position, keep your knees where they are, and then exhale as you bend over, trying to get your chest as close to the floor as possible. Hold this stretch for about 20 seconds.
The isometric stretch is almost identical to the passive stretch, but before you bend over, place your hands on your ankles and your elbows in the crooks of your knees. As you bend over, use your elbows to ""force"" your knees closer to the floor while at the same time pushing ""up"" (away from the floor) with your thighs to resist against your arms. Once again, please be careful since this can place considerable strain on the knees.



, You will need an apparatus for this stretch: a bench, or a firm bed or couch (or you could use two chairs with your butt on one chair and the heel of your foot on the other) that is at least 12 inches (30.5 cm) off the ground (but not so high that you can't sit on it with out your knees bent and the sole of your foot solidly on the floor). The bench should be long enough to accommodate the full length of your leg.

Sit on the bench and have your leg comfortably extended out in front of you (your heel should still be on the bench) and the other leg hanging out to the side with the leg bent and the foot flat on the ground.



, Place your hands around the ball of your foot and gently pull back so that you force yourself to flex your foot as much as possible. Hold this stretch for about 20 seconds (don't forget to breathe).
Now for the isometric stretch: in this same position, use your hands to try to force the ball (and toes) of your foot even further back toward you while at the same time using your calf muscles to try to straighten your foot and leg. You should be resisting enough with your hands so that no actual foot (or leg) motion takes place.



, Still sitting on the bench in the same position, straighten your leg out while trying to hold onto your outstretched leg with both hands on either side as close as possible to your heel. Starting up with your back straight, slowly exhale and try to bring your chest to the knee of your outstretched leg. You should feel a ""hefty"" stretch in your hamstring and even a considerable stretch in your calf (even though you just stretched it). Hold this stretch for about 20 seconds.
Now for the isometric stretch: when you have gotten your chest as close as you can to your knee, try to put both hands under the bench by your heel (or both hands on opposite sides of your heel). Now grab on tight with your hands and try to physically push your heel (keeping your leg straight) downward ""through"" the bench, the bench will provide the necessary resistance, and should prevent any leg motion from occurring.



, Now turn on the bench so that your leg is outstretched to your side, and you are facing the leg that is bent. You may perform this next stretch with either your toe pointing up toward the ceiling or with the inside edge of your foot flat on the bench with your toe pointing forward (but flexed), or you may try this stretch both ways since you will stretch some slightly different (but many of the same) muscles either way. I prefer to keep my toe pointed towards the ceiling because I personally feel that the other way applies to much stress to my knee, but you can do whatever feels comfortable to you.
Note: If you are using two chairs instead of a bench, the first thing you need to do is to make sure that one of the chairs supports your outstretched leg somewhere between the knee and the hip. If the support is being provided below the knee and you try to perform this stretch, there is a good chance that you will injure ligaments and/or cartilage.
Place your hands underneath the bench directly under you (or you may keep one hand under the portion of the bench that is below the knee of your outstretched leg) and pull yourself down and forward (keeping your back straight) as if you were trying to touch your chest to the floor. You should be able to feel the stretch in your inner-thigh. Hold this for about 20 seconds.
For the isometric stretch, do the same thing you did with the hamstring stretch: keep both hands underneath you as before and try to force your foot downward ""through"" the bench.



, It mainly stretches the psoas muscle located just above the top of the thigh.

Crouch down on the floor with both hands and knees on the ground. Put one leg forward with your foot on the floor so that your front leg is bent at the knee at about a 90 degree angle. Now extend your rear leg in back of you so that it is almost completely straight (with just an ever so slight bend) and so that the weight of your rear leg is on the ball of your rear foot with the foot in a forced arch position. Now we are in the position to stretch (notice that your rear leg should be in pretty much the same position that it would assume if you were performing a front split).
Keeping your back straight and in line with your rear thigh, exhale and slowly try to bring your chest down to the floor (you shouldn't need to bend much further than the line your front knee is on). You should feel the stretch primarily in the upper thigh of your rear leg but you should also feel some stretch in your front hamstring as well. Hold this position for at least 15 seconds. If you wish to also stretch your rear quadricep from this position, you can shift your weight back so that your rear leg makes a right angle with your knee pointing toward the floor (but don't let it touch the floor). Now, without bending your rear leg any further, try to force your rear knee straight down to the floor.
Now repeat the same stretch(es) with your other leg in front.
For an isometric stretch, you can do this same stretch in front of a wall and instead of putting your hands on the floor, put them in front of you against the wall and then push against the wall with the ball of your foot (without decreasing the ""stretch"" in your psoas).



, You must be very careful when performing this stretch because it can be hard on the knees. Please be advised to take it easy (and not overdo) while performing this exercise. If you have problems with your knees, you may be better off not performing this stretch at all.

Put the pillow under your rear knee and let your knee rest on the floor. Lift up your rear foot and grab onto your foot with the opposite hand (grab the instep if possible, but if you can only reach the heel, that is okay). If you have trouble grabbing your foot, then you may need to sit (or shift) back onto your rear leg so that you can grab it, and then shift forward into the starting position (with your hand now holding your foot). Now, exhale and very gently, but steadily, pull your foot toward its buttock (butt-cheek) and lean toward your front foot (you may also wish to twist your waist and trunk towards the foot you are holding). You should feel a tremendous stretch in the quadricep (top right thigh) of the foot that you are pulling. If you begin to feel stress in your knee, then discontinue the exercise (but let your foot down slowly -- not all at once). Hold this stretch for about 15 seconds. When you are finished, shift your weight slowly back onto your rear leg and let your foot down while you are still holding onto it. Do not just let go and let your foot snap back to the ground -- this is bad for your knee.
Now for the isometric stretch: Get into the same position as for the passive quadricep stretch, but as you lean forward and pull on your foot, resist with the leg you are holding by trying to push your instep back down to the ground and out of the grip of your hand (but no actual movement should take place).
Now do the same stretch with your other leg in front.
Stop the stretch immediately if you feel pain or discomfort in your knee.



, This exercise should be performed after you have stretched each of these areas individually with prior stretches (like the ones mentioned above).

Start by lying down with your back flat on the ground and your legs straight together in the air at a 90 degree angle. Try to have your legs turned out so that your knees are facing the side walls more than they are facing your head. Slowly bring your legs down to the sides, keeping your legs straight and turned out. When you reach the point where you cannot bring them down any further into this ""lying"" side split position, leave them there.
Now for the stretch: With your feet both flexed or both pointed (your choice) use your arms to reach in and grab your legs. Each arm should grab the leg on the same side. Try to get a hold of the leg between the ankle and the knee (right at the beginning portion of the calf that is closest to the ankle is almost perfect). Now, exhale and use your arms to gently but steadily force your legs down further and wider (keeping the legs straight) getting closer to the lying side-split position (where, ideally, your kneecaps would be ""kissing"" the floor). Hold this position and keep applying steady pressure with your arms for about 20 seconds.
For the isometric stretch, you do the same thing as the passive stretch except that, as you use your arms to force your legs wider, use your inner and outer thigh muscles to try to force your legs back up together and straight (like a scissors closing), but apply enough resistance with your arms so that no motion takes place (this can be tough since your legs are usually stronger than your arms).

Load the barbell with weights.,
Get into position.,
Grab the bar.,
Rack the barbell.,
Squat below the parallel.,
Explode out of the starting position.,
Lift the bar over your head.,
Repeat the exercise.,
Perfect your form.,
Gradually increase the weight on the barbell.,
Rest when you need to.",How to Do a Thruster," Find a barbell and load it with some weights. The barbell should be heavy enough to give you a good workout but not so heavy that you can’t complete the exercise using the proper form. Make sure the plates are securely attached to the end of the barbell. If you’re not sure how to do this, refer to the barbell manufacturer manual or talk to a gym employee.


This exercise can also be performed with sand bags, kettle bells, dumbbells, or cinder blocks. However, most people use barbells.If you have trouble using good form during the exercise, reduce the weight of your barbell.;
, Stand in front of the loaded barbell with your feet a shoulder’s width apart. Your back should be slightly arched with your shoulders pushed back. Keep your arms straight and your knees slightly bent.Stand close enough so that your feet are under the bar but not so close that your shins are touching it.

, Bend your knees and lean towards the bar, bending at the hips instead of curving your back. Grasp the bar firmly in both hands with the back of your hands facing away from you. Your hands should be a shoulder-width apart on the barbell.


Make sure to keep your back straight and your shoulders back. Otherwise, you may injure your back while lifting the barbell.

, Stand up, keeping your back and arms straight. Next, lift the bell upward, pushing your elbows underneath the bar. Rest the bar under your chin. Keep your elbows high to stabilize the barbell.Your back should be straight at all times.
Don’t lock your knees. If you do, you may pass out.

, Squat quickly, holding the barbell under your chin. While squatting, keep your back flat and your knees pointed outward.To squat below the parallel, lower yourself until you’re almost sitting.


If you have trouble keeping the bar steady, remove some of the weights. It’s better to have good form than to lift a lot at once.
Balance your weight on your heels and the outside of your feet.

, Stand quickly, keeping the barbell steady. While standing, keep your back straight and push upwards using your heels.Don’t stand so quickly that you stumble or fall backwards. The motion should be steady and controlled.


If you feel yourself starting to fall backwards, push the barbell away from you. This will stop it from falling on top of you.

, Use the momentum from your explosive standing motion to lift the barbell over your head.Straighten your arms and push your head forward. Your ears should come past your biceps.Lean your head back again and lower the barbell back to the starting position under your chin.


Don’t lock your arms when you lift the weight.
If you can’t lift the barbell into the air, use less weight.

, Use fluid, quick movements to repeat the process. A good thruster is one continuous movement instead of several smaller ones.If you’re following a particular workout, you will know how many repetitions and sets you need to do. If not, consider doing ten thrusters at a time until you become exhausted.


If you can’t complete a thruster using smooth, controlled movements, use less weight on the barbell.

, The better your form is, the more quickly you will build muscles. Good form means good muscle gains in the long term.To improve your form, watch yourself complete the exercise in the mirror. Other methods of improving your form include:


Asking a Crossfit expert for tips
Watching videos of people performing successful thrusters
Hiring a trainer for one-on-one advice

, Once the exercise becomes easy, you need to add more weight to the barbell. The more weight you add, the stronger you will become.If your workout is easy, you’re not going to see any progress.


Increase the weight slowly. For example, add five pounds to each side of the barbell each time you want to increase the weight.
Don’t add too much weight at once. You might injure yourself.

, If you start becoming overwhelmed, take a break. If you injure yourself, you won’t improve as quickly. Additionally, it’s important to understand the difference between working to exhaustion and working until you hurt yourself. For example, if your muscles begin to feel weak and wobbly, take a break.


If your heart rate jumps suddenly, take a break. Continue to monitor your heart rate and see a doctor if you’re worried.
If you experience chest pain or pressure, call 911. You may be having a heart attack.
If you feel dizzy, take a break. Eat a snack and drink some water."

, You may need to schedule a few sessions to develop an appropriate beginning routine.

, This may entail buying extra equipment to use at home or in the gym.

, Not all gyms can accommodate every disability; however, there has been a move toward creating extra space around weight machines to accommodate people in wheelchairs.


If you are unable to find a gym that will accommodate you, then you may need to lift weights in a physical therapy facility or at home. Ask your physical therapist what equipment will be most beneficial to you.

, A spotter helps you avoid injury by taking the weight from you, if you are unable to perform a repetition. You can either ask someone else to lift weights with you or you can hire a personal trainer at a gym to serve as a spotter.

, This will help to reduce your risk of muscle strain and other injuries.

, Learn the proper technique from your physical therapist and ask for diagrams to remind you when you lift at home or in the gym. Keep your back straight and avoid bending or stooping.

, Small hand weights, resistance bands and light setting on weight machines train your muscles to get into shape with less pain and risk of injury than large weights. People who suffer from arthritis and other disabilities may choose to always lift small weights with more repetitions.


The Framingham Disability Study found that people who lift small weights in enough repetitions to trigger muscle exhaustion can build muscles without moving on to higher weights. This is especially advantageous for the elderly who cannot lift weights over 10 lbs.

, This is called the ""eccentric contraction."" Your muscles are actually stronger as you lower the weight than as you lift it.


If you are unable to lift a heavier weight, ask your spotter to lift it for you. Then, lower it to help build up your muscle. Do this for a number of repetitions a few times per week, until you are able to lift the heavier weight.

, You can decide to use different muscle groups on different days. You can also alternate your workouts with stretching and aerobic options to improve your overall health.

, Most people who start to lift weights will experience muscle exhaustion after their first few weightlifting sessions. It is likely to be painful and reduce your range of motion, but try to move normally and stretch your muscles gently.


Drink plenty of water and eat foods with plenty of protein. Protein helps to rebuild your muscle fibers.

, You can also add more weight. Although either can be attempted, start with increasing the repetitions by 2 to 5 repetitions until you are confident you are strong enough to lift more weight.

, weightlifting can prevent osteoporosis, increase muscle mass and prevent atrophy if it is done regularly. Aim to lift weights 2 to 3 times per week, and continue it even if you notice you have achieved the tone you desire.

",How to Perform Passive Range of Motion," This is the recommended amount to prevent severely tightened joints and muscles. A doctor may request that you do them at a greater frequency.;
, The best platforms are beds that can be adjusted so that the helper doesn’t need to lean over and strain the back while working with the patient’s joints.


If you must use a low bed for a passive range of motion routine, grab a chair and get it as close to the bed as possible to reduce strain.
Lock the bed or table so that it can’t move while you are performing the exercises.

, You will be performing the movements, so they should not have any strain or feel out of breath.

, You should stop the exercise and lay the patient’s body in a relaxed position until the pain subsides. Skip the painful exercise and move onto the next one if the patient is able.

, Some physical therapists suggest doing the exercises in the bath if possible, since it can improve the flexibility of the joints and relax the patient.

, Usually this means placing a hand beneath each of the joints on a limb., It is more important that you move slowly and extend the joint through its full range of motion than it is to hold the stretch for a long period of time., It is important to exercise both sides equally.

Angle your feet for plié squats.,
Stop at the bottom.",How to Do Free Squats1," In essence, ""squatting"" simply means to bend your knees, bringing your backside closer to the floor. For best results, try bending your knees to a 90 degree angle, then standing back up., This protects your knees and back, and helps you achieve maximum results. When you move into a squat, bend your knees so that they move directly over your feet, without going further than your toes.







, For a standard free squat, start by keeping your feet under your shoulders. This help to avoid stress on your knees., A plié squat is a free squat done with a wide stance. For these, it is important to angle your feet out and to bend your knees so they move directly over your feet. Begin by doing these at only a half-range of motion, and work up to getting your knee bends to 90 degrees.







, After you build up some leg strength, you may begin to ""break 90,"" or allow your squat to deepen more than a 90 degree bend in your knees. However, it is important to stop when your thighs lightly come into contact with your calves. Going beyond this can place unnecessary stress on your knees.

Limit doing pull ups to two to three times a week.",How to Do Pull Ups for Beginners," To build muscles in your shoulders and arms, start with flexed arm hangs. To do flexed arm hangs, place a box near the pull up bar that puts your chin just over the bar. Place your hands on the bar with your palms facing you. Lift yourself upward and hold yourself slightly over the bar. Keep your elbows flexed, and your chin over the bar. Hang over the bar in this position as long as is comfortable. Gradually increase how long you hang over the bar as you build up to doing pull ups.





;
, Dead hangs help build your arm strength and allow you to eventually work your way up to pull ups. To do a dead hang, place a chair near the pull up bar so your arms can just reach the bar. Grab the bar with your palms facing away from you. Pull yourself up about an inch, moving your elbows to the side as you pull your body up. Bend your knees to lift your feet off the stool and hold this position for as long as is comfortable.








Your shoulders should not raise up at all while doing this move. If you find your shoulders raising upward, you need to build more strength before moving on to actual pull ups.

, Lowering your body takes practice as well. To get into the hang of lowering your body, place a chair under the pull up bar and grab the bar with your hands shoulder-width apart and your palms facing you. Step off the chair as you tense up your muscles. Very slowly lower your body. Then, step back on to the chair and repeat the process.








You should keep doing this exercise each day until you can lower your body slowly. You should be able to control the speed of your body as you lower it. If you find yourself plummeting downward quickly, you're not ready to do pull ups.

, You should focus on practicing one aspect of pull ups each day as you work your way up to doing regular pull ups. Make a schedule for yourself where you alternate practicing different aspects of the pull up, with rest days in between.Start with hanging exercises. Do sets lasting about 20 to 30 seconds with one to two minute breaks in between. Do this every other day to build your muscles.
Then, transition into body lowering exercises. Go for eight repetitions of lowering your body. Do two or three sets, and rest for a minute between sets. Do your sets every other day.
As you feel comfortable, begin combining hanging and lowering exercises, remembering to take breaks in between. Eventually, you'll find yourself feeling comfortable lifting your body and transitioning into a pull up.

, Before jumping into full on pull ups, work on what are called hanging and chin pulls. Start with three to five 20 to 30 second reps of simply holding the pull up bar as your body hangs down. After doing this, stand on a chair with your chin above the pull up bar. Then, bend your knees so you are are holding your body above the bar. Do three to five reps of this exercise, holding the pose for five to 10 seconds for each rep.








Keep practicing this exercise every other day until you no longer struggle with it.

, Negative pull ups help you learn the body lowering aspects of pull up exercises. To do negative pull ups, repeat the chair exercise where you lower your body. Then, lift yourself up just slightly. Lift your body as far as you can without your movements becoming jerky. Do four to six repetitions of this movement.








You can move on once negative pull ups become comfortable for you.

, To do rows, place the pull up bar on a squat rack until it's waist-high. Position yourself beneath the bar. With your hands slightly farther than shoulder-width apart, grip the bar. You should be in either an inverted push-up or plank pose. Straighten your arms and let your body hang beneath the bar, holding your feet out in front of you. Then, pull your chest near the bar. Hold this for three seconds.








Once you can comfortable do three sets of 15 rows, you can move on to full on pull ups.

, After gradually building your skills, you should be able to start doing pull ups. Get into the hanging position and grab the pull up bar. Keep your palms facing away from you and pull your body upward. Keep pulling until your chin is close to the bar, pause for a second, and then lower your body.







, At first, you may only be able to do a few pull ups each day. Do not add pull ups too quickly. If you go too fast, you can strain yourself. Strive to only add one to two pull ups to your sets each day.







, You should never jump into a workout plan before talking to a medical professional first. This is especially important if you have any underlying health conditions. Before attempting to do pull ups, talk to your doctor to make sure pull ups are safe for you.


Talk to the doctor about any existing problems or concerns with your back, neck, shoulders, elbows or wrists.

, If you're new to pull ups, you may be inclined to jump to help propel your body upward. This prevents you from using the right muscles to do pull ups. Try to lift your body only with your arms and upper muscles. Do not jump as you do pull ups.







, You should only do pull ups, or any other weight training work out, two to three times a week. Doing pull ups any more often than this can cause strain. Always take a rest day in between days you do pull ups."

Join a running group.",How to Begin Running," Now. The best way to start running is simply to put on a pair of running shoes and hit the pavement, dirt or grass. The motion of running will feel strange at first, as muscles that normally don't get much use spring into awkward action. This is normal. Run until your legs are burning and your chest is heaving; for true beginners, that usually occurs after about 5-10 minutes.


When you're just starting out, you don't need fancy running shoes. An old pair of sneakers will do. Once you know you want to continue the sport, you can upgrade.
Run in comfortable clothes. Put on gym shorts, a t-shirt, and a sports bra if necessary. Don't wear anything too constricting.
Run anywhere. Your neighborhood, in a park, up and down your driveway, on the local track at a school. One of the best things about running as a sport is that you can do it almost anywhere, and you're not chained to a gym.

, Try to loosen your body and move forward in a way that feels natural. Pump your arms, take comfortable strides, stand upright with a slight forward lean, and pick your feet up high off the ground so you don't catch a toe in a crack in the sidewalk. Speaking of toes, it's best to run more on the toe or front of your foot, running on the heel will increase your chance of shin splints. Every runner has a slightly different gait, since everyone's body is different, so figure out what works for you.


Avoid bouncing and try to land softly in order to reduce stress on your knees and other joints.
Find your stride. Recent evidence has come to light that your foot strike (toe, mid-foot, heel) is a natural occurrence that should not be altered. That being said, the faster you run the more forward on your foot your strike will be.
Relax your upper body. Holding yourself stiff impairs mobility and makes you run slower. Keep your weight centered and your shoulders in a relaxed position, with your arms bent at 90 degrees., Breathe naturally or focus on a breathing technique. Some argue that the best breathing technique is inhaling oxygen through the nose, fully expanding the lungs, and exhaling through a widely opened mouth. Your nose is a good filter for air, especially while running outdoors, which prevents you from accidentally swallowing bugs. Exhaling through your mouth allows your body to get rid of more carbon dioxide and heat with less effort.

, Although the benefits and/or drawbacks to stretching before a run are controversial, there is little argument about the benefits of stretching at the end of each workout. Stretch out each muscle group, holding each stretch for at least 15-20 seconds.


The most important muscles to stretch are your leg muscles. Stand a few feet from a wall and lean into the wall (moving one foot closer to the wall but leaving the other one a meter out) so that you feel your calf muscles being stretched. Do one side then the other.
Bend your knee and lift your foot till your foot is back up near your butt. Hold that foot with your hand and bring it real close to your butt. You should feel a stretch along the front of your thigh. Swap sides. Alternatively, you can step forward and lunge into the front foot, keeping your knee behind your toe until you feel the stretch in your thigh. This will save your knees, instead of putting unnatural stress on the tendons and ligaments around your knee that could lead to future damage.
Standing near a table or a fence rail (at about hip height) try to put your foot up on the table or fence rail. Now try to straighten out your leg. You should feel a stretch along the back of your leg. Swap sides.

, This is how you build endurance; running once a week won't cut it. Space out the days to allow for recovery time between sessions. Anything more goes beyond fitness and into running for other purposes, something you may find yourself doing if bitten by the running bug.


Run rain or shine, in cold weather and hot. Just be sure to dress appropriately for the weather.
Stay hydrated and eat light before running. Good rule of thumb is to eat 200-300 calories about 1.5 hours before the run.
Try listening to music during your run. Running to the beat will help you maintain a healthy pace.

, As the weeks go on, push yourself to run further and for a longer period of time. If you ran 10 minutes at a time the first week, push yourself to do 15 the second week. Make it 20 the third week. You'll soon find that you're able to go much longer before you feel like you have to stop. To build endurance, try these strategies:


Don't worry about speed at first. In fact, you should really run more slowly than you think you should. You're not running a race yet; you're increasing your fitness level. For now, focus on gradually decreasing the time or increasing the distance you run. The racing can come later, if you choose. Starting small is important to develop the habit of running.
Alternate running and walking. Rather than stopping your exercise session when you feel like you have to stop, walk for a few minutes, then start running again. Repeat over a period of 30 or 40 minutes. Next time you run, increasing the ratio of running to walking during the same 30 or 40 minute period. Eventually, get to the point where you're running the entire time.
Do sprints. Running as fast as you can for a short period of time builds up your muscles and helps you gain endurance. Mix up your long running sessions with sprinting days. Use a stopwatch to time yourself. Start by sprinting as fast as you can for a quarter mile; do this 4-6 times. On your next sprinting day, try to beat your first time. Add more quarters as you gain endurance and strength.

, Running the same boring track day in and day out is going to make you feel burned out pretty soon. Treat yourself to a run in the woods, or in a neighborhood you've never explored before. Try to rotate your workout sessions between 2 or 3 different places to keep things interesting.


Make it convenient. Find places to run near your home, work and/or school. Schedule workouts when you are least likely to be interrupted like early in the morning or on the way home from work.
Be prepared for changes in plans by carrying some gear with you (in your car) when at work or school. That way if the traffic is terrible, you can go for a run until the traffic thins out.

, After a few runs, you might be inclined to think you aren't cut out for running. You'll think to yourself, shouldn't this be more fun by now? Why does it hurt so much? Just keep going. Tell yourself you'll give it at least two weeks before throwing in the towel. After a few weeks of pushing yourself by following a running routine you will begin to feel lighter, faster, and you'll start having more fun. Eventually you'll realize you don't want to miss a run.

, If you're serious about this running thing, it's a good idea to have yourself fitted at a running store, as different shoes are designed for different types of feet. The right shoe for one person is the wrong shoe for another and will cause injury. A good running store can test you to make sure you get the right shoe. It is a good idea to bring along a used pair of shoes as the wear pattern can help determine the pronation of your feet. Identifying pronation will help you choose the right shoes to support your foot type.


The person helping you can use an old pair of shoes to determine where you put the most pressure on your feet, and can help find the design that will most minimize injury.
Your typical sporting goods store does not have the expertise to get you in the correct shoe.

, Once you've done one, you'll probably want to do more. To train for a 5K race, which is just over 3 miles (4.8 kilometers), follow a weekly schedule 3 days a week for a 2-month period:



Week 1: Brisk five-minute warm-up walk. Then alternate 60 seconds of jogging and 90 seconds of walking for a total of 20 minutes.

Week 2: Brisk five-minute warm-up walk. Then alternate 90 seconds of jogging and two minutes of walking for a total of 20 minutes.

Week 3: Brisk five-minute warm-up walk, then do two repetitions of the following:

Jog 200 yards / 180 meters (or 90 seconds)
Walk 200 yards / 180 meters (or 90 seconds)
Jog 400 yards / 365 meters (or 3 minutes)

Be passionate about something.,
Be yourself.,
Be self-sufficient.",How to Be Desirable1," A carefree attitude is very desirable, because so many people feel stressed and worried. They desire relationships that are positive and worry-free.


Try a joke to break an uncomfortable silence. Laugh regularly without covering your mouth to prove you are someone who knows how to have a good time.;
, Go up to the other person or start a conversation. Don’t be self-deprecating when you are meeting new people.


Say “You caught my eye and I was hoping we’d have a chance to talk.”
If you have tried and the person doesn’t seem interested, have the confidence to walk away. Leave knowing that the person is losing out on a chance to get to know you.

, Pick up on physical and emotional cues, such as body language. Someone who has social smarts and empathy is a more desirable partner, because they will care about others’ feelings.

, Employers, family members, friends and partners appreciate someone who has life goals. Whether it’s work, a charity, a hobby or a culture, passion will set you apart from others., Instead of trying to project characteristics that you think another person would find desirable, try not to change how you act depending upon whom you are around.

, Needy and co-dependent people will turn people off quickly. A man who can cook or a woman with a successful career is very desirable for their independence.

Keep your core tight and chest upright.,
Avoid bouncing.,
Increase your reps over time.",How to Do Free Squats2," If not done carefully, squatting can put a lot of strain on your lower back. Protect your back and ensure proper form by keeping your core muscles firmly engaged. Imagine you are contracting your belly button toward the middle of your back. As you keep your tummy tight, this should help you to hold your chest upright. Imagine that you are trying to let sun shine on the top of your clavicle and chest., Descend with control and ascend in any manner, however do not ascend without braking at the top. When you see professional or elite athletes doing squatting movements very fast, they are moving with control.








, Build your squatting ability over several workouts by adding a repetition or two every workout. Squat as often as twice a week and as infrequently as once every three weeks. Begin by doing just one set of 10-13 reps (or repetitions). Add a couple of reps, or a set, each time you work out. Build up strength and increase your reps slowly in order to protect your spine and avoid injury.

Do free squats on the balls of your feet.,
Try chair squats.,
Mix up your workouts.",How to Do Free Squats3," If you come up to the balls of your feet while squatting (also called relevé) you will work your calf muscles. You try staying up on your toes the whole time, or simply doing a calf-raise at the top of each squat.







, Instead of moving up and down in your free squats, try sitting back and doing an isometric hold. That is, hold yourself in the bottom squat position, as if you are sitting in a chair. Try holding this for 30 seconds, and adding time as you get stronger. You can also try doing this against a wall.







, Doing a variety of squats works more muscles and makes your workout varied and more fun. Additionally, when the leg muscles are strengthened, a person's metabolism becomes more active. Performing a mix of different squat exercises works more muscles and revs up your metabolism to burn more calories.

Wash the windows inside and out.,
Do a deep squat as you clean your toilet.,

Move your furniture each time you plan to vacuum the house.,
Squeeze in your abdominal and buttock muscles as you vacuum.,
Scrub your floors each week by hand.,
Wash your car by hand every week.,
Do some laundry by hand every week.,
Choose 2 to 4 activities to engage in everyday, in order to attempt to burn between 300 and 400 calories, what many people aim to burn during a gym workout.

",How to Exercise and Lose Weight by Turning Everyday Household Chores into an Exercise Routine2," This is a great shoulder conditioning workout as long as you use a cloth in a circular motion. Do this for at least 30 minutes to work your shoulders and arms and burn approximately 150 calories.

, Instead of sitting on your knees and leaning forward, you can stand straight and squat, trying to stay balanced. Apply your cleaning product, brush the toilet and wipe clean.

, Just like sweeping the floor, you should flex your stomach and oblique muscles and keep your back straight. Pull as far away as possible and squat, rather than bend, to pick up the leaves.


This activity can be extended to other garden activities, such as mowing the lawn, flower planting, composting or general gardening. These activities, when done for at least 1/2 hour, will result in burning between 150 and 190 calories. Try to keep your back straight, as many people can end up with lower back strain.

, Moving furniture in good form, by bending your knees and straightening your back, is a form of weightlifting. Move each piece of furniture slightly and vacuum behind and replace it again.

, Use large sweeping motions and smaller motions. Reach up high with your vacuum extension.


Vacuuming a house can burn approximately 80 calories, where moving furniture can burn over 200 calories.

, Use a knee pad or do deep squats while you reach the corners with a cleaning product and a brush. Mopping the floors burns just a portion of the 190 calories you can burn by hand-cleaning 1 floor.

, Grab a sponge, some mild liquid detergent, water and a bucket and wash all areas of the car. Use long sweeping motions to get hard to reach places and squat down to clean tires and the running board.


Cleaning your car by hand can burn approximately 150 calories and work your arms, core muscles, and legs.

, Fill a bathtub with water, laundry detergent and dirty clothes. Rub the clothes against themselves and each other for 10 to 20 minutes.


Rinse the clothes twice in fresh water and squeeze to dry. For more delicate items, allow them to hang and drip dry or lay flat. Be careful not to lean too far into the bathtub, as that can put extra strain on your back. Make sure your core muscles are flexed the entire time and you will be getting an excellent core workout.
Cleaning upholstery and curtains by hand can also have the same effect. This may only need to be done monthly or yearly.

Have good posture.",How to Be Desirable2," Don’t leave the house with wet hair, sweat pants or with mismatched socks. Generally, a few extra minutes ironing a shirt, shaving and combing your hair will improve your desirability.


A 1997 scientific study found that “self-care” factors had more influence on attractiveness than height, body type or other unchangeable attributes., Invest in clothing that fits your body. You don’t need to buy “sexy” clothing, but both men and women respond to people who are self-aware and present themselves well. Make sure you are dressing your age and accentuating your best traits.
If you need help with this step, ask a person who’s style you like where they get their clothes. Ask someone of the opposite sex what looks best on you when you go shopping.

, A person who exercises shows discipline and an interest in health.


If you are a woman and you want to work out in order to maximize your desirability, measure your waist circumference and your hip circumference. Divide the former by the latter. Aim for a decimal below 0.8, which is a sign of an hourglass figure.If you are a man and you want to work out to maximize your desirability, aim to have a higher waist to shoulder circumference. Many women and men find a triangle torso more desirable than a flabby midsection.

, Desirability in a mate has its roots in finding a healthy partner for procreation. Eat a healthy diet, get plenty of activity and avoid habits like smoking and binge drinking., Use lip balm, or if you are a woman, use red lipstick. In a social setting, plump, red lips are attractive and sensual., An expensive watch or nice coat may attract someone who is looking for a good provider. Although this might not be a lasting connection, it can lead to more options for partners., Standing up straight with your shoulders back projects confidence, physical health and height. Consider consulting a physical therapist if you find it hard to change your posture on your own."

Zumba founders proudly tout that it'd be easier to tell you the places it's not offered than the places it is.So no excuses! Your local gym, the Y, or area dance/yoga studios should be your first go-to. Zumba.comhas a class finder, too!


Find a Licensed Zumba Instructor. Only Licensed Instructors can teach Zumba and all licensed instructors are listed on http://www.zumba.com. Licensed instructors who belong to ZIN (the Zumba® Instructor Network) have access to the newest Zumba fare -- updated routines, more song choices, more variation in style and the specialties like Zumba Toning, Aqua, Step, Sentao etc. To find out, all you have to do is ask!;
, Since Zumba is so huge, it's all over YouTube and even Xbox and wii. If you're not into the class dynamic, don't have a gym to go to, or would plain just like to stay home, Zumba can come to you. There are literally dozens of titles to choose from between the two aforementioned consoles. And yes, you will break a sweat!


YouTube is a great resource, too. Even if you are taking a class, watching a few videos can help gear your mind up for what you should expect and knock that learning curve down a notch. But remember, every class and every instructor is different, though the Zumba mentality and lifestyle remain the same.

, This is a fitness/dance-craze epidemic for a reason: everyone can do it. And with the different types of Zumba, it's pretty indisputable. Here are the current types offered:



Zumba Fitness: This is your standard class. It has high-energy rhythms and distinctive Latin beats that will guarantee you're sweating and having a great time.

Zumba Toning: With this class, you use toning sticks. Think of them as fitness maracas for your abs, glutes, arms, and thighs.

Zumba Gold: This class is aimed at baby boomers and above. The class is a bit calmer than the standard, though it follows the same basic principles.

Zumba Gold Toning: No surprises here, it's Zumba Toning for the wise-beyond-their-years population. A large group, for the record!

Aqua Zumba: Effectively marketed as a ""Zumba pool party."" You do the same (and more) Zumba moves, only halfway emerged in water. You can imagine how much tougher it is!

Zumba Sentao: This class is centered around a chair. It helps strengthen your core, work on balance, and steps up the cardio in a new and dynamic way.
""Zumba Step"": All of the Step toning and strengthening for legs and glutes plus all of the Zumba® fitness-party fun.

Zumba in the Circuit: This combines Zumba and circuit training. Between dancing your butt off, you'll be doing strength exercises to get an all-around workout.

Zumba Kids: For the little ones!

, As with anything, each class or instructor is going to be a bit different. Some classes will be jam-packed, some classes will be shorter or longer than others, and each instructor will have their own unique style. So if you start a class and you're not crazy about it, try another one before you give it up. You could be surprised how much of a difference it makes!


And since there are so many different types of Zumba classes, experiment with that, too! If you like Zumba Fitness, try to mix it up on occasion with Zumba Toning or Aqua Zumba. Keeping your body surprised is just as important as surprising your mind!

, While being a dancer is totally not a prerequisite to being good at and enjoying Zumba, knowing what you're getting into can't hurt. There are elements of the cha cha, salsa, and merengue in Zumba -- along with a bit of hip hop and modern (and legit core exercises, of course!). Luckily, it's wikiHow to the rescue! Check out the following for a brief brush-up:


How to Do the Cha Cha
How to Dance Salsa
How to Dance Merengue

, Any class is going to be difficult if you're not adequately prepared for it. To sidestep this easily side-steppable hurdle, wear the right clothes! You will heat up quickly, so go for light clothing, or layers that you can shed at will. Do know that it's all about style, though -- some students will be in Spandex and some will be in baggy sweats. There's no right or wrong!


And when it comes to footwear, aim for an exercise shoe that's worn in. If it has too much tread, you won't be able to float and pivot like you want. For the record, it's worth investing in some dance sneakers if you do decide to stick to it. They're only about $30.00 from a discount dance supply store and can easily be found online.

, Even though you're spending the hour dancing and not feeling like you're getting a workout, you most definitely are. You WILL be sweating, so bring a towel and some water! Most instructors take small breaks between songs, so you'll be glad you did.


Some swear that in an hour's class, you could burn near 600 calories.That's amazing! That's an hour avoided on the treadmill! Of course, it depends on how much energy you put into it. But there's serious potential there.

, Most fitness classes have a serious structure to them. The instructor stands at the front and talks at you for pretty much the entire hour. In short, this isn't that. There's a reason they ask you if you want to ""join the party"" when you start.It's a workout where the hour flies by and you'll forget you're not at the club (or home in your underwear).


Many feel that it's a way of life. Some even say Zumba-ers make for better friends.In your class, you become friends who hang out, party, and dance together. There's an air about it that you won't find elsewhere. It'll suck you in!

, Alright, so after all this talk, what is it anyway? Well, it's a whole bunch of things. Some of the styles in Zumba, like salsa for instance, are fused with hip hop. Add in some merengue and cha-cha steps and you've got the idea. Let's not forget the aerobic aspect either! You'll be shedding the pounds shaking your booty, doing the mambo, and swiveling with the best of 'em.


No, you don't have to be a dancer. Remember how Zumba is for everyone? If you're taking a class, just let your instructor know you're new to this thing, and they can give you the rundown. Be sure you can see their entire body, though -- don't hide in the back!
There is no pressure to be super fit. You just do what you can when you can. All the moves are of such a nature that you put as much effort into it as you want to. If your fitness level isn't great, then you just take it slower!

, The first class you take may actually be difficult. You may feel like you're overwhelmed and you can't keep up with the moves and you just really don't have any idea what's going on. But by the second class, you'll remember things. You'll pick up on your favorites. And by the third, you'll leave asking for more.So give it a few tries. Everything takes time to learn and get good at. The more you do it, the more you'll enjoy it!

, To get the most out of Zumba, you gotta let loose. You gotta channel your inner child and dance like no one's watching – Dance like no one is watching. Who cares if you're shaking it to the left when everyone else is shaking it to the right? No one, that's who. If you let loose and enjoy yourself, you're doing it right.


If you're tentative about your moves, you won't get the workout you're meant to get. If you keep your feet toeing the line (more literal talk here) and your arms at your sides, you won't have fun, you won't sweat, and you probably won't come back. So go for it!

, This is the easiest way to get more out of your Zumba workout. It's tempting to be a little reserved, to let your legs do the brunt of the work, but throw your arms in there, too! Those Latin dancers look so good because while their feet are moving, they make sure the movement is seen through their entire bodies -- even down the lengths of their arms. You wanna look like them, right?!


When it doubt, just hold them strong. You don't have to flail them around like a madman or a six-year-old, but do hold them out from your sides, strong and sassy-like. Half the fun of Zumba is the attitude!

, There are squats, lunges, and some straight-up workout moves in Zumba. Then there are the natural levels of the dances, when your instructor has you working closer to the floor and working your way up. When this is part of your choreography, go all out. The more up and down you move, the better a workout you'll get. And the more you'll feel it in the morning! You know, the burn and the sense of accomplishment.

, If you've got it, flaunt it, right? So shake away. The entire room is pretending like they're Jenny from the Block, so join in! The only wrong way to do it is to not do it. The more you shake, the better you'll look, the more fun you'll have, and the more you'll be doing the moves like they're meant to be done. So shake, shake, shake. Shake, shake, shake. Shake yo' booty. Shake yo' booty!If you think you're doing a move that can't incorporate a bit of a hip swivel or booty shake, think again. There is a sexiness at the core of Zumba, for sure. Let yours out!

, You could be reserved about the moves, you could do the moves exactly like your instructor is doing, or you could do it your own way -- the way you're best at, the way that gives you the most satisfaction, the way that you enjoy the most. And if you do, you'll burn way more calories going for it. Is it for fitness or pleasure that you're rocking out? Who knows!


And once you have the moves down, adding your own flair, your energy will add to the dynamic of the class. The more people who are taking the leap, truly letting loose, the better it'll be. You'll all be able to feed off of each other's buzzes! Now that's a high quality workout!

Remember to use your left hand at all times.",How to Become Left Handed when you are Right Handed," Becoming proficient with your left hand will not happen overnight - it's a process that could take months or even years to complete. So if you want to learn how to use your left hand, you will need to commit to practicing daily.


Set some time aside each day to practice your left hand writing. It doesn't need to be much; even 15 minutes a day will help you to improve at a satisfying pace.
In fact, it is better not to commit yourself to practicing for long periods of time, as you will probably get frustrated and be inclined to give up.
Practicing a little everyday is the best way forward.
Practice drawing letters in the air. Start by doing this exercise with your right hand, and then transfer it to your left hand by copying. Transfer the skill to paper later; sustained practice will be required to properly prepare your muscles.;
, When training yourself to write with your left hand, it's important that you hold the pen or pencil comfortably.


Many people are inclined to grip the pen too tightly, balling their hand up into a claw around it. However, this creates tension in the hand, causing it to cramp up and become tired easily. When this happens, you will not be able to write well.
Keep the hand loose and relaxed instead, mirroring how you hold the pen with your right hand. Make a conscious effort to relax your hand every few minutes while you are writing.
The materials you write with can also make a significant difference to how comfortable you find writing with your left hand. Use nice quality, lined writing paper and a good pen with free-flowing ink.
Also tilt the paper or writing pad you're working with 30 to 45 degrees to the right. Writing at this angle should feel more natural.

, Begin by writing out your ABC's with your left hand, in both capital and lowercase letters. Go slowly and carefully, concentrating on making each letter as well-formed as possible. Accuracy is more important than speed for now.

As a point of comparison, you should also write out your ABC's using your right hand. From then on, you can focus on getting the letters you write with your left hand as perfect as those you write with your right.
Hold on to your practice pages by keeping them in a folder somewhere. Then when you reach a point where you feel frustrated and tempted to give up on your quest to become left-handed, you can look back on these sheets and see how far you have progressed already. This should give you renewed motivation to continue.

, When you become tired with the ABC's, you can progress onto writing sentences.


Start with something simple like ""I am writing this sentence with my left hand."" Remember to go slowly and focus on neatness rather than efficiency.
Then try writing ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"" over and over again. Since this sentence contains every letter of the alphabet, it's a good one to practice with.
Other sentences containing all 26 letters are: ""The five boxing wizards jumped quickly"" and ""Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs"".

, When children are learning to write for the first time they use writing workbooks where they can trace over letters made from dotted lines. This helps them to control their hand movement and gain accuracy.


When learning to write with your left hand, you are essentially teaching both your hand and your brain how to write all over again, so using these workbooks is not a bad idea.
You can also use copies with extra lines on the paper to ensure your letters are in the correct proportions.

, In the English language, along with many other languages across the world, people write from left to right or from ""thumb to pinky"".


This feels natural for right-handed people. It also helps to prevent the ink from becoming smudged as your hand moves across the page.
For left-handed people, however, this movement often feels unnatural and can make a mess as the hand moves across the fresh ink. For these reasons, left-handed people often feel more comfortable writing backwards.
In fact, the famous artist Leonardo da Vinci was left-handed and often wrote notes and letters backwards. They could only be deciphered by holding the paper up to a mirror and reading from the reflection.
Practice your own backwards writing with your left hand -- you might be surprised at how easy you find it. Remember to write from right to left, ""thumb to pinky"" on your left hand. You will also need to write the letters backwards for true backwards writing!

, Although the goal is to learn how to write with your left hand, you can also benefit from drawing with your left hand. This will give you valuable practice in controlling your left hand, while also building strength.


Start with something simple, such as drawing basic shapes like circles, squares and triangles. Then progress onto sketching items you see around you, like trees, lamps and chairs, then if you're feeling particularly confident, people and animals.
Drawing upside down (known as inverted drawing) using your left hand is another great exercise you can try. This will not only improve your writing skills, it is also a great brain-training exercise which will open you up to more creative thinking!
Many great artists such as Michelangelo, da Vinci and Sir Edwin Henry Landseer were ambidextrous. This enabled them to switch from one hand to the other while drawing or painting if their hands got tired or they needed to work at a particular angle. Landseer was also famous for being to draw with both hands simultaneously., As mentioned above, learning how to write with your left hand is a process that will take time and dedication. You will need to be patient with yourself and prevent yourself from giving up too easily.


Remember that it took you years to master writing with your right hand as a child and even though it shouldn't take you quite this long to write with your left (as some of the skills are transferable) the learning process will take time.
Don't worry about speed initially; just keep practicing with as much control and accuracy as you can and you will become faster and more confident with time.
Keep reminding yourself of what an impressive and useful skill it will be when you can write with your left hand. Staying motivated is the biggest challenge you'll face as you work towards becoming left-handed.

, Skill automatically transferred from your right hand to your left hand somewhat in all those previous years of your life so it won't be extremely hard to start doing things with your left hand at first. Since skill also automatically transfers from one task to another task somewhat, you will gain the skill faster to do a specific task with your left hand if you do all tasks with your left hand than if you do just that task with your left hand. Be patient. Some people say the older you are, the harder it is to change handedness but that's misleading. The illusion that changing handedness is easier at a younger age comes from the fact that the higher the skill you have with your right hand, the lower the patience you have for a given amount of skill in your left hand. In fact, the older you are, the shorter it takes for your left hand to gain a given absolute amount of skill. The easiest, but most important thing you can do to strengthen your left hand is to use it to complete all of the actions and activities you would normally do with your right hand.


Make an effort to brush your teeth holding the toothbrush in your left hand. You can also comb your hair, pick up your coffee cup, butter your bread and open doors with your left hand, amongst many other daily activities.
Also try throwing darts (in a safe environment), playing pool or throwing and catching a softball with your left hand
If you're finding it hard to remember, and keep using your right hand accidentally, try bandaging the fingers of your right hand together. This will prevent you from being able to use it and force you to use your left hand instead.

, One of the best ways to strengthen your left arm and hand, and correct any strength imbalances between your dominant and non-dominant sides, is to lift weights.


Hold a dumbbell in your left hand and do exercises such as bicep curls, kickbacks, hammer curls and dumbbell presses.
Start with a low weight, then move up to heavier weights as your strength improves.

, Learning how to juggle using three and then four balls is a great way to strengthen your left hand and arm, while also providing you with an impressive party trick!

, One great exercise for improving ambidexterity and strengthening your non-dominant hand is to take two table tennis rackets and two balls and to bounce them simultaneously with both hands.


Once you master this, you can progress to using smaller rackets, or even wide-ended hammers.
In addition to improving your left-hand usage, this is a fantastic whole brain exercise!, Many people who play musical instruments (which require the use of both hands) are already somewhat ambidextrous.


As a result, picking up a musical instrument -- such as the piano or flute -- and practicing everyday will help you to strengthen your left hand., Swimming is another ambidextrous activity which has been proven to help with balancing the brain hemispheres, allowing you to use you non-dominant hand more fluidly.


Hit the swimming pool and do a few lengths to strengthen the left side of your body and get a great cardio workout at the same time!, Washing Dishes regularly with your left hand is a safe and simple method to improve on the dexterity of your non-dominant hand.This can be both fun and useful in the long run, apart from cleaning the dishes.

, Doing that will also practice up the general skill of automatically transferring skill from an action to its mirror image so that the next task you start doing with your left hand that you used to do with your right hand, you will be a tiny bit more skilled at doing it with your left hand when you first start than you would have been if you had never done it with either hand before. It may take many years for your left hand to catch up to the skill of your right hand but probably less than 2 months for your left hand to become very nearly as skilled as the right hand. Once your left hand becomes skilled enough to do do the job easily, there's no need to be impatient about your left hand becoming more skilled just because your right hand is even more skilled. You can skip the steps 2-7 if you want to hurry up and become ambidextrous and can handle the boredom of doing them slowly at first.

, Using your dominant right hand has become so engrained in your brain that you will use it automatically, without thinking. This can be a problem when you are attempting to become left handed. To overcome this problem, try to come up with a system to remind yourself to use your left hand whenever you do something.


For example, write the word ""left"" on the back of your left hand and the word ""right"" on the back of your right hand. This will act as a visual reminder every time you go to pick up a pen or complete some other activity.
You could also try wearing your watch on the right wrist instead of the left. This will really help your subconscious to register that you are trying to change sides.
Another thing you can do is place sticky notes on things like the phone, the refrigerator and the door handles. These will remind you to use your left hand whenever you reach out to touch them.

, Try on as many pairs of shoes as it takes before buying any. The right pair should feel cushioned, support your arches and give you room in the toes.


Contrary to what many people think, you should not have to break-in running shoes very much. They should feel good right away, so don't settle for anything less than an extremely comfortable shoe. If possible, wear them around the house every day for a week before working out, so that you can take them back if they start to rub.







, (0.5 to 0.7l) of water in the 90 minutes before you do a treadmill workout. Since most treadmill workouts are over 20 minutes, you can sweat heavily and suffer with dehydration later on.


Bring a water bottle filled with at least 16 oz. (0.5l) of water with you to place on the treadmill.






Make sure to visit the bathroom before you use the treadmill. A break in your workout can interrupt the rhythm and aerobic benefits of your workout.







, Try crew socks, instead of ankle socks, to avoid blisters.

, Dedicate 5 minutes before and after each treadmill session to walking at a pace of 1.5 to 2 mph (2.4 to 3.2 km/h) (mph).


If you walk to the gym, this can also count as your warm up and cool down.







, You may be tempted to hold onto the handles at the front of the treadmill to gain your balance. This will keep you from burning calories, using good posture and learning to use it properly.

, You should notice a speed section and incline section where you can increase or decrease the settings. These will be the main buttons you use on the treadmill.


Wait to use programmed workouts until you are comfortable with the manual settings. You will be able to customize your workout to your fitness level.







, Although you may choose to stop using it as you get comfortable, this clip is an emergency shut off. If you lose balance in the beginning it will keep you from falling or being seriously injured.

, For the first 15 minutes of your workout, you are most likely burning carbohydrates that you ate recently. After 15 minutes, you begin to burn body fat and build endurance.

, This warm up can help you to gain balance and avoid injury. Hook the safety clip to your body before starting.


Walk at 1.5 to 2 mph (2.4 to 3.2 km/h) for 1 minute.

Increase the incline to 6. Remain at a speed between 1.5 and 1.8 mph (2.4 and 2.9 km/h). Walk for 1 minute.






Take longer strides for 1 minute. If this is hard with the incline, decrease your speed. Return the incline to 0 after 2 minutes at 6.






Increase the speed to 2.5 for the last minute.







, You can remain at the same incline and speed during your first week of treadmill use.

,, You should increase the incline above level 4 for 1 to 2 minutes and return it to a slower speed. You can increase your speed by .5 mph (0.80 km/h) for 1 to 2 minutes.


Interval training is the best way to increase endurance, speed and fat burning capacity. Intervals of 1 to 2 minutes should raise your heart rate, then you can return to a medium intensity. Medium intensity workouts are approximately at the rate where you breathe heavily but can still carry on an intermittent conversation.







, The aim of the high intensity intervals is to raise your heart rate substantially.

,, You should aim to increase the speed of the treadmill by 1 to 2 mph (1.6 to 3.2 km/h) during this interval. People who are in good shape may be able to increase it more.

,,,


Increase your high intensity interval by 15 to 30 seconds each week.






Try pre-programmed interval workouts once you are able to do 1 minute intervals with confidence. You can also use hill workouts to increase your intensity with incline rather than speed.

",How to Avoid Getting a Beer Gut," Are you currently happy with your current physical state or do you need to lose a few (or many) pounds in order to have a beer-gut free body?


Determine if you're within normal weight ranges. While the body mass index (BMI) calculator should not be the “end-all, be-all” way to determine if you're fit (because it doesn’t take cardiovascular health or muscle mass into account), it may provide you with a jumping-off point to determine if you need to lose weight. Determining your BMI is done with a mathematical calculation that compares your height to your weight to determine if you are within what is considered to be a healthy weight. Numerous online BMI calculators are available for quick calculation or you can run the numbers yourself (weight in pounds times 703 divided by the square of your height in inches). A BMI reading of 18.6 to 24.9 is considered to be within normal range. See How to calculate your BMI for more details.
Clothing fit. Have you had to go up a size or two in pants over the past few years? Does your stomach “muffin-top” over your pants––meaning does it spill over the top of your pants, resembling the top of a muffin? If your stomach seems to be expanding, it may be time to change your diet and exercise routine.
Are you comfortable wearing a swimsuit? Do you feel as if your midsection isn’t overly tight or that you're carrying flab in the stomach area? You want to feel confident and good at the beach and a flabby tummy may discourage you from even going.;
, One of the best ways to avoid getting a beer gut is to stick to a clean diet. A “clean diet” is one that consists of natural, whole foods that haven’t been overly processed. An example of a clean diet might consist of one serving of steel cut oatmeal for breakfast, baby carrots for a snack, a spinach salad with vinegar and oil dressing for lunch and a piece of grilled fish with steamed vegetables for dinner.


Watch portion sizes. Ditch your regular dinner plates and instead use salad plates for your main course. Read labels carefully so you eat exactly one serving.
Eat a clean breakfast. Go and read the label of your favorite cereal now. If you see sugar and vegetable oil in the ingredients, start searching for something healthier. Try an egg each morning (Tim Ferris' suggestion), or have oatmeal with slices of fresh fruit. Healthy cereals should be free of sugar and vegetable oils, such as wheat flakes, wheat bran, sugar-free natural granola, amaranth cereals, etc. If your supermarket aisle is lacking, check the health food store. Just remember to read your labels! Cereals can look healthy on the box but still contain sugars, salts and fats.
Eat clean fats that don't lay themselves down around your gut. Fats less likely to be stored as body fat include the fats in EVOO (extra virgin olive oil), lean meats, seafood, nuts, seeds and avocados. Fats likely to help build a beer gut include deep fried foods, margarine, trans-fats processed products, pastries, doughnuts (sorry!) and many baked goods.
Cut down on white carbs (processed carbohydrates). Take the white bread, white pasta, white rice and white flour baked products out of your life. Their refinement and smooth taste is growing your beer gut. Switch to wholegrain bread, brown rice and wholegrain/unrefined flour types. Be aware that your body will burn off stored carbs before stored fat, which can make losing weight harder for you.
Include more protein in your diet without making it all you eat. Some people seem to be obsessed with protein-heavy diets at the expense of healthy carbs and fats. It is far better to eat quality protein in small amounts to keep you satiated than to deny yourself the full range of nutrients from all healthy food types. Choose protein from such sources as lean meats, seafood, pulses, unflavored and unsalted dairy products, eggs and moderate amounts of nuts.

, If you purchase high quality (and even organic) produce and meats, you may find that the food has great flavor by using only a few spices instead of drowning your food in sauce. Good cooking methods such as broiling, steaming and light sautéing, as well as allowing yourself time to get used to the taste of food without added condiments can help you to wean yourself off such extras.


Get used to reading the ingredients. Be savvy about just what those names on the label mean for your stomach. Remember that names can be disguised with all sorts of marketing fluff, so check online if you're not sure what the names for the ingredients mean. For example, if you see a label that includes sucrose, glucose and invert sugar on it, it's just told you that the processor has added sugar (in different forms, but still all sugars) three times to the product during it's manufacturing!

, Sugar is one of the biggest culprits to building a gut and it's hidden in almost all of the processed foods and drinks consumed. While kicking the sugar addiction may be difficult, you will eventually find that even fresh fruit tastes sweeter after you’ve eliminated refined white sugar. And as for the beer of the beer gut, it's full of sugar unless you choose a sugar-reduced version. It's liquid sugar and it goes straight to your stomach.


Be patient with your taste buds. It takes time to train them to less sugary tastes. Taste buds renew themselves every few weeks, so hang in there for about a month of gradual taste changes and the new ones will be happily trained to accept less sugar (and other additions).
Use spices to improve the sweetness of foods. (Using Pico De Gallo on oranges, apples, watermelons and other fruits actually enhances their sweetness and delicious flavors!)
Have more real fruit instead of juiced fruit, leather fruits or sugary, processed fruit products.

, A beer gut is so-called because it was first noticed (by lay persons, not just the medical fraternity) in association with those who indulged in regular and high-level beer drinking. Most alcohol is high in calories and all alcohol is empty calories and a potential nutritional thief, meaning, that replacing healthy foods with alcohol deprives your body of essential nutrients. If you're actually on a diet, alcohol should be only a minimal part of it. If you're simply trying to maintain your current healthy weight, alcohol consumption should be kept to a minimum.


With aging comes less ability to work off that alcohol. If you're young and skinny you might be able to soak it up like a sponge right now but you're laying down the foundations for fattening up later and one day, you'll wake up and notice changes that you don't much like and that are much harder to budge because you don't metabolize or move like you did when younger.
Cut out one drink a day from your diet. If you're enjoying three glasses of alcohol a day now, whether it is beer, wine or spirits, choose to only have two. Maybe choose to reduce this to one a day a few weeks later, then reduce it to only one or two drinks a week.
If a cocktail is more to your liking, choose a low-carb beer or a vodka and club soda drink––both have less than 100 calories per serving.
Drink lots of... water! Water prevents hunger, stops you from eating more than you need, improves your metabolism and can stave off food cravings. Plus, it's good for you.

, Exercise can help tone muscles and kick start your metabolism. Find a workout you enjoy so you don’t dread it every day, and if that means that only walking is your thing, then get walking every day for at least 20 minutes (take your best canine friend along if you have one).


Cardio is king. Losing your gut basically means that you need to shed fat and kicking up the cardio workout will help you reach your goal faster. Remember, the best way to get the most from your workout is to push yourself as hard as you can in small intervals. You won’t get a great workout by strolling on the treadmill. Instead try to inject small bursts of energy between slow walks and build up to longer energy bursts.
Include two to three weightlifting days or combine cardio and weights for a fat-blasting workout. Muscle has been known to boost the metabolism so adding a few weight days in between cardio can help build lean muscle tissue. In addition to building muscle, a weight routine in between cardio days will mix up the monotony of doing the same workout all week long and allow certain parts of your body to rest while working other areas. Many fitness centers offer weight and cardio combined classes––also numerous fitness experts sell workout routines on DVD.
Mix up your workout every few weeks to promote muscle confusion. After a month of doing the same workout, your body may plateau. This means you don’t continue to experience the same results as you did during prior weeks. If this happens, put your current workout on the shelf and try something new. For example, if you’ve been running, try a spin class or the elliptical trainer for a month. Then go back to running again.
If you're a walker, try to walk 10,000 steps a day. To know that you're achieving this, get a pedometer or make use of the pedometer tucked into some MP3 players, iPods and similar digital devices. The motivation of the pedometer is an excellent tool of self-discipline and makes walking as personally competitive and fun as any other sort of sporting activity. Try for at least 4,000-6,000 steps uninterrupted, with the rest made up through the day.
Don't be a couch slouch. Couch potatoes are infamous for their beer guts precisely because they don't exercise and they eat while watching TV. Inactivity + food = weight gain (aka beer gut). A little slouching now and then is fine; a daily activity it is not.

, Even the most disciplined person needs a cheat day or meal every once in a while. Allowing yourself to have a cheat meal or day once a week or so, will keep you focused on your diet the rest of the time. It can even show you that you aren’t so keen on sugar or fat anymore if you’ve been sticking to a clean diet because the sudden sweetness will really hit you.


Have one cheat meal per week that doesn’t consist of more than 1,000 calories at one sitting. Although a cheat meal or day is fine, don’t go hog wild. Keep an eye on calories, fat and sugar to have some control over your cheat meal.
Don’t fall off the wagon completely if you do cheat. For some dieters, if they cheat one time they completely ditch their diet for good. Remember, the idea of the cheat meal or day allows you to leave your regular routine at the door and indulge to break up the monotony of eating clean 24/7. Have your cheat meal, but by all means resume your regular eating patterns the next day.
Choose “smart” cheat items. Choose healthy alternatives to “junk” or cheat items. For example, if you crave popcorn, air pop the corn and add non-stick butter spray and light salt instead of going for the movie kind.

Locate gyms in your area.,
Research other martial arts forms.,
Find out the instructors' background and experience.,
Observe a class.",How to Try a Krav Maga Workout1," If you live in a smaller town, you may not have many options. However, in big cities there typically are multiple krav maga gyms. Make a list of those near you and consider the convenience of the locations as you narrow down your list of possibilities.Think about when you likely will be doing your krav maga workout, and identify gyms that won't be too far out of your way, if at all possible.
Most krav maga gyms have websites. Read through the website to learn more about each gym and get a general understanding of whether you think you would feel comfortable there. The website typically will have enough information to get you acquainted and give you a feel for the place, as well as the experience and style of the instructors.
If you think you may want to continue through the ranks of krav maga as a student, it's a good idea to limit your list to those gyms that teach only, or mainly, krav maga. You may have more options if you're only interested in krav maga for fitness. Many gyms offer krav maga themed exercise classes, particularly those that focus on high-intensity exercise regimens, such as CrossFit.;
, Especially if you're interested in krav maga for self defense, it's worth considering other fighting or defense styles. When choosing a self-defense style, you want to make sure you feel comfortable and confident with the moves.You can research online, or you can go to other gyms and watch a class in progress – preferably a beginner's class – to get an idea of what the instruction is like.
With some older and more well-established martial arts, you may have more of a variety of locations than you do with krav maga.
Keep in mind that krav maga is not a competitive martial art, in the sense that there are not staged competitions among practitioners, as there are in other martial arts disciplines. The only way to get a sense of what krav maga is all about is to observe a class.

, As part of choosing the right gym for you, speak to instructors and find out where they were trained and if they have any credentials or certifications.Avoid choosing an instructor who is vague about their credentials or hasn't been certified by a credible organization, such as Krav Maga Worldwide or the Israeli Krav Maga Association.
Even though krav maga is very intense, and the instructors may be intense people, they also should be warm and welcoming. If you don't feel comfortable around an instructor or they seem uncaring, you may want to steer clear.

, Once you've narrowed down your selections, or possibly found the gym you think you want to join, ask if there's a class you can watch. Ideally, you should observe classes in several different gyms before making your final selection.Sitting in on a class is the best way to find out what goes on in a krav maga class and whether it's an environment in which you feel comfortable and confident.
You also can get a sense of the relative fitness levels of other people taking classes at that particular gym.
You also may want to observe different classes in the same gym that are taught by different instructors. This can help you choose the best instructor for you based on their training style and attitude.

Use your treadmill away from walls or windows.",How to Use a Treadmill," Your joints and muscles work best when they’re warmed up for about 5 minutes. Get your blood flowing by walking at a slow pace on a slight incline, such as at a 2% incline. This will help you avoid injuries such as muscle strains or tears.Follow your run with a few minutes of walking to cool down.;
, After warming up for a few minutes, increase your speed to a light jog. After 5 minutes, increase your speed slightly. Proceed to increase speed until your pace is a sprint, then gradually decelerate in 5 minute intervals.Consult your treadmill’s manual or talk to a trainer at your gym to learn about interval training regimens that are programmed into your machine’s computer.
Never set your speed beyond your abilities. Always underestimate your maximum speed on a treadmill to avoid injury.
Remember that the way you run on a treadmill is a little different from how you’d normally run. Get used to how this slight change feels before sprinting.

, Switching up your workout routine will help you keep interest and avoid doing any damage to particular muscle groups. If you focus on speed training and you try to run at a full sprint on one day, focus on the distance the next. Sprint for five to 20 minutes on your speed day, then jog for 20 to 60 minutes on the next day. Remember to begin and end your workouts with walking to warm up and cool down.Check your control panel, consult your manual, or talk to a gym trainer to learn about automatic terrain settings that can simulate walking over hills.
If you live on flat land but you’re training for a race or marathon that’ll take place in a hilly area, using terrain training functions can be a great way to build your endurance.

, Holding onto the handrails will take some of your body weight off the muscles of your legs and core. This will burn fewer calories and give you less intense of a workout. If you need to take a break, bring the belt to a stop and step off for a minute.Don’t hold onto handrails while running or sprinting, as this can put you at a greater risk of falling.
The major exception to this rule is if you have any balance issues or special needs to take into account. Use handrails when walking to maintain your balance, and be sure to consult your doctor about any further precautions you should take.

, Raising your arms above your head while speed walking can improve your workout and maximize the number of calories you burn. It raises your heartbeat, making your workout more challenging, and strengthens your upper-body. Try moving your arms up and down with each stride in addition to holding them above your head for an extended period of time., Consider including an upper-body routine with your treadmill workout by using the handrails to do chest presses and triceps presses.Turn the belt off, or step off the belt onto the treadmill’s side tracks.


Grip the front rail, setting your hands as wide as the rail’s length will allow. Do a set of standing chest presses by bending your arms and bringing your upper-body close to the front rail and display panel, then push yourself back up so your arms are straight.
Face the rear of the treadmill, extend your arms, and take hold of the handrails. Do another set of chest presses using a pushup motion.
Do overhead tricep presses with dumbbells.
Grab a pair of light weights, such as 3 or 5 pounds, and do biceps presses as you walk for even more upper-body strengthening.

, When you’ve gotten the hang of walking normally on a treadmill, consider lateral walking exercises, or walking with a slow side shuffle. Position yourself sideways on the belt and side-step at a speed of 1 to 1.5 miles per hour. Use a handrail as you begin your shuffle to help keep balanced.Begin with walking on the treadmill as normal. Hold the handrail in front of you as you walk straight, then grab hold of the handrail in the direction you’ll be turning. In one quick step, turn and shuffle. Practice on flat ground if you’re unsure of the motion.
Walk an equal amount of time on each side so you work your muscles evenly., Start off walking normally on the treadmill. Make sure the speed is set to less than 2.5 miles per hour. Turn by keeping hold of the rail on the side you’re turning into as you did when you shifted into a side shuffle. Reach for the other side rail and grab hold to keep your balance as you pivot from the shuffle position to backwards walking position.Use a high incline setting to maximize your leg workout.
Switch backwards and forwards walking every two minutes to mix up your routine and exercise different muscles.

, Check to see if there are any treadmill classes available at your local gym. If you enjoy social settings, classes can help you stay engaged in your exercise routine. If you have a treadmill at home, look into workout videos, which offer challenging and unexpected ways of using a treadmill set to a pace and order designed by a fitness professional., Before taking on any aerobic routine, talk to a doctor about your heart health. Ask your doctor about any limitations you should place on your workout regimen.When seeking medical evaluation, consider your spine and joint health, particularly your knee and ankle joint health.If you have low cartilage, arthritis, or other joint problems you should ask your doctor if a treadmill’s belt cushioning would be hard on your joints.
Your doctor might recommend walking on grassy or soft surfaces to prevent further joint damage.

, Before using any treadmill, make sure you go over its control panel, workout options, and safety features. Seek guidance from a trainer at your gym, or if you’re purchasing a treadmill for your home, consult the salesperson or other professional at the store. Locate the emergency stop button and determine whether the treadmill has a safety stop tether or clip., If your treadmill does have a safety tether or clip, always use it. This feature clips to your clothing and automatically stops the machine if you pull away from the control panel. While most people skip out on the tether, it’s the best and most recommended way of avoiding serious harm when using a treadmill.If you suddenly fall, you will not be able to stop the machine using the emergency stop button, as it’ll be out of your reach.
Stopping the belt can prevent burns, abrasions, and other forms of bodily harm.

, Always use proper form when walking or running on a treadmill. Your body should be straight and upright, with your shoulders held back and chin up. Your abdominals should be tight, and your gaze should be fixed straight ahead. Don’t look down at your feet., One of the most common causes of treadmill-related injury is distraction due to looking at a cell phone. Consider leaving your phone elsewhere or putting it on airplane mode so you won’t be tempted to answer any calls or texts. If you use your cell phone to listen to music while running, use an arm strap for hands-free use, and keep it on airplane mode., Avoid jumping off a treadmill while the belt is in motion. Instead, wait until it’s come to a stop to dismount. Turn the machine off or use any available pause function if you need a break, and never jump back on a belt in motion., Your gym will most likely have positioned its treadmills to avoid injury in case of a fall, but you choose where you place your home machine carefully. If a treadmill is positioned too closely to a wall, you are at a greater risk of becoming pinned between the moving belt and the wall. This can result in significant bodily harm. Make sure you have 6 to 8 feet of clearance between the rear of the treadmill and the nearest wall. Never position the rear of your treadmill close to a window or glass door, or a fall could put you at risk of colliding with the glass.Make sure you take measurements of the area in your home where you’re placing the treadmill before purchasing one.
If you’re purchasing a treadmill to use at home, go with one that has both an emergency stop button and a safety tether clip. Making sure the machine stops in the event of a sudden fall is especially important at home, since there won’t be any trained professionals to offer assistance as there are at a gym.Consider all members of your household when purchasing a treadmill. Make sure it’s located in a room where you can keep young children from accessing it.

Recognize the symptoms.,
Treat a primary exercise headache.,
Prevent future primary exercise headaches.",How to Stop a Severe Headache After a Long Run1," Primary exercise headaches are the most common type of exercise headache. It is not known why some people experience primary exercise headaches, although some doctors believe it may have something to do with dilated blood vessels caused by strenuous activity.Common symptoms of primary exercise headaches include:A throbbing pain in one or both sides of the head.
Headaches that begin during or immediately after strenuous activity.
Symptoms persisting anywhere from five minutes to 48 hours.;
, There are a number of prescription medications available that can help treat primary exercise headaches and their causes. Some people with predictable exercise headaches may be able to take medication before a planned workout, while others who experience erratic or unpredictable exercise headaches may need to take medication on a daily basis.Talk to your doctor if you believe you need a prescription-strength medication to treat primary exercise headaches. Common medications include:


Indomethacin — this non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication (NSAID) is commonly prescribed to treat pain and inflammation. It may help treat moderate to severe primary exercise headaches.If you are taking indomethacin, talk to your doctor about any other health issues you or your family have experienced. NSAIDs (not including aspirin) have been linked with an increased risk of heart attack or stroke.Propranolol — this prescription-strength blood pressure medication may help prevent primary exercise headaches in some people.Propranolol alters the body's response to nerve impulses, which may help lessen pain associated with conditions like exercise headaches.Naproxen — this NSAID is commonly used to treat arthritis pain. It has been shown to be effective at treating headache pain in some people.Naproxen is available in both prescription and over-the-counter forms.If you are taking naproxen, talk to your doctor about any other health issues you or your family have experienced. NSAIDs (not including aspirin) have been linked with an increased risk of heart attack or stroke.Phenelzine — this prescription-strength medication belongs to the monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) class of antidepressants.It may help treat the symptoms of exercise headaches in some people.Ergonovine — this prescription-strength medication is typically prescribed to treat hemorrhaging caused by giving birth.Some studies suggest ergonovine may help treat exercise headaches in some people., Some research suggests that engaging in warm-up activities prior to strenuous exercise may reduce the incidence of exercise headaches.Though there is no way to ensure that exercise headaches will not return in people susceptible to this condition, doctors believe that certain environmental and medical conditions may put people at greater risk of having recurring symptoms. Factors associated with primary exercise headaches include:


Exercising in hot or humid weather.Exercising at a high altitude.Having a family history of migraines or chronic headaches."

Develop fun games to play while using the treadmill.",How to Stay Entertained on a Treadmill1," In addition to keeping you entertained, music can motivate you to push yourself harder during your workout routine.


Play music on your stereo if you work out at home, or listen to music using your portable or digital music player and headphones.
Select a variety of rock or dance songs for your playlist that fall between 120 and 140 beats per minute (BPM). Songs with fast tempos that fall within this BPM range will help maintain your energy and motivation during your workout.;
, Examples of entertainment you can listen to while on the treadmill are audiobooks, talk radio, comedy routines, and educational materials.

, Many gyms are equipped with suspended televisions you can watch from afar, or have televisions that are directly mounted to the treadmills.


Position your treadmill in front of a television if you work out at home.
Watch your favorite movies or television shows. You can even schedule your workout around your favorite television programs, which can also help maintain your daily workout routine.

, Reading a novel or story can be an ideal way to stay entertained on the treadmill, but this method should only be practiced if the book or magazine can be safely secured to the treadmill, for safety purposes.


Verify that the treadmill has a tray that supports the book or magazine, or use clips or clothespins to secure the book or magazine to the dashboard of the treadmill.
Read using a digital e-reader or tablet so that you can read and turn pages with the quick push of a button or by briefly touching the screen of the device.

, This method can be especially entertaining if you are at a gym or community center that is frequented by other people.


Play variations of counting games during every workout. For example, count the number of people wearing a certain brand of athletic shoes throughout your workout, or count the number of people wearing a specific shirt color.
Designate certain songs or artists on your music playlist that require you to run or walk faster when they are played. For example, when songs by a specific artist are played, increase your treadmill speed for the duration of those particular songs.

You can't choose the right class until you understand your own long-term goals.For example, if your overall goal is to lose weight, you're going to choose a different class than you might if your overall goal is simply to add variety to your workout regimen with a different type of exercise.
You may want to take classes that focus more on stance and form, such as heavy bag classes, if you want to learn real-life self-defense skills.

, Many krav maga gyms have a number of different fitness classes that are specifically tailored to achieve particular fitness goals. Read through the offerings to find the class that's best suited for you.For example, there may be a cardio krav maga conditioning class. These types of classes are primarily focused on strength-training and weight loss.
You might also find programs with heavy bags that combine punching, striking, and other fighting moves in a fitness and workout context. You're not fighting against another person, so these classes are non-combative in that respect, but you'll still get an intense workout.
There also may be classes that focus more on mobility, flexibility, and improved range of motion. These classes typically will be more low-impact than the other options.

, Krav maga is an intense workout. Even if you have an athletic background, you still should consult your physician to confirm that you're physically able to handle the intensity.It's particularly important to consult your physician if you have a chronic health condition, or if you're still recovering from a recent injury.
Don't assume that your doctor is familiar with krav maga. You may want to bring along information or videos so they can get a better idea of what you're going to be doing.
You also can speak to the instructors at the gym you've chosen. They may be willing to speak with your doctor if necessary and answer any questions they may have.

, Treat your krav maga workout like any other new workout or exercise experience. Although krav maga is reality-based and the moves are designed to be intuitive, proper form and technique is still very important.Take your time and be patient. Ask the instructor questions if you feel that you're not doing a move with proper form, or if you're experiencing pain in doing a certain movement.
Be ready to practice until you get the moves down. The instructor will break down a new movement for you if you're having trouble understanding the correct stance or body placement.

, Because any krav maga workout is going to be intense, you need to be prepared for it. This means making sure you've eaten properly and had a good night's sleep the night before your class.Wear comfortable, moisture-wicking clothing to your krav maga class, and bring water and a towel to wipe away sweat. You also need to make sure you're well hydrated before the class. Drink plenty of water during the day, and have a protein snack or shake about a half-hour before your class is scheduled to start.
Expect to be sore for a few days after your krav maga workouts, especially in the beginning. Plan your workouts accordingly, giving yourself several days to recover between intense workouts.

Sign up for a beginner class.,
Learn krav maga belt levels.,
Master the basics.,
Talk with your instructor.",How to Try a Krav Maga Workout3," The types of beginner classes available will vary widely among gyms. Talk to instructors at your gym to find out where you should start if you decide you want to train in krav maga as a self-defense art.Some gyms don't have specific introductory classes that are required, but the instructors will be able to point you toward the best class for you given your fitness level and background.
Keep in mind that since krav maga is reality-based, not a competitive martial art in the sense that disciplines such as karate are, your background in other martial arts forms isn't really relevant to krav maga training. In krav maga, everybody starts at the same level.

, Like other martial arts disciplines, krav maga has a system of belt and class levels through which you can progress as you study. While belts aren't worn in class as they are in other disciplines, an understanding of the system can help you evaluate your progress.In most cases, you can expect to stay in the beginner level, equivalent to a yellow belt, as you train for four to six months. This time frame is based on two to three days of training, so if you're only taking a weekly class you can expect it to take longer.
You will have to take a grueling test to advance to the next level. If you pass the test, you will move into a higher level class already in progress.
After moving out of the initial yellow belt beginner level, expect a year or more of training before you're able to advance to the next level.

, In your first classes, you will learn fighting stances, basic striking techniques and defenses. You also will learn basic safety skills, such as how to fall correctly and how to get back up again safely.The first classes will involve direct combat with your instructor and other students, so expect to be intensely challenged. Keep in mind that any self-defense discipline is about being calm and in control in a stressful situation.
Basic krav maga also teaches you to have a heightened level of awareness and avoid situations in which you could be unsafe or possibly be ambushed.

, At most krav maga gyms, you must start at the lowest, P1 level. There typically is no set program of skills you must learn before you can advance. Rather, your instructor will let you know when they think you are ready to proceed to the next level.You can stay at the P1 level as long as you want and still get a good workout as well as learning useful self-defense skills, or you can decide you want to advance.
At more advanced levels, you can learn how to use weapons, disarm attackers, and fend off multiple attackers.
Keep your own goals and interests in mind at all times. You don't have to advance to the next level if you don't want to, or if you feel you're not ready.

Treat the symptoms of exercise headaches.,
Treat rebound headaches.",How to Stop a Severe Headache After a Long Run3," Insufficient water levels may decrease the pressure inside your arteries, which can then limit how much blood gets into the lining around your brain. This can cause migraines in some people.Any time you exercise, try to drink water while working out, or at least be sure to rehydrate as soon as you get back from your run to help get blood flowing back to your brain.The amount of water you drink depends on how much you exercised and how much you sweat. As a general rule, your urine should be clear or almost clear when you are sufficiently hydrated.

Headaches will typically get worse after restricting medication use before they get better.
Hospitalization or cognitive behavioral therapy may be necessary for some individuals with severe reactions to discontinuing long-term medications.
Avoid caffeine if you are experiencing rebound headaches. Caffeine is known to trigger rebound headaches in some people.

Use a different interval or running program daily.,
Focus on training a different part of your body on a daily basis.,
Race the person next to you on the treadmill.,
Set daily exercise goals.",How to Stay Entertained on a Treadmill2," Most treadmills are equipped with settings that allow you to choose from a variety of workout programs; such as intervals, inclines, and other routines that can keep you entertained.


Browse running programs and routines using the controls or dashboard buttons on your treadmill. You can also consult directly with the treadmill manufacturer to determine how to program or use certain routines.

, Although treadmills may not provide the most versatility in regards to a complete body workout in every aspect, you can choose to focus on either strength training or cardio training.


Practice strength-training and muscle-building for your thigh and calf muscles by slowing down your pace and setting the treadmill on the steepest incline.
Focus on an intense cardio workout by using no incline and running at the fastest possible pace you can manage.

, This practice can be especially entertaining and motivating if you work out with a friend or other acquaintance.

, Setting and working toward a daily goal can keep you entertained and focused throughout your workout as you strive to meet your goal.


Set goals that determine the length of your workout, the distance you run or walk, or the amount of calories you burn. For example, if you ran 2 mi (3.21 km) yesterday, set a goal to run 2.25 mi (3.62 km) today.

Repeat as needed.,
Perform half jacks.,
Hold dumbbells.,
Wear wrist and ankle weights.,
Increase your speed.,
Stretch your shoulders.,
Open your hips.,
Stretch your quadriceps.",How to Perform Jumping Jacks," As simple as standing up straight sounds, there is a technique to it. Relax your shoulders back and down along your spine. Keep the natural curve of your neck by relaxing your jaw too. Hold the top of your head up and directly between the tops of your shoulders. Keep your hips over your heels and relax your pelvis., From an upright, standing position widen your stance so that your feet are below your shoulders. Keep your arms beside your body and relaxed., With your feet shoulder width apart, slightly bend your knees so you can hop. As you hop, or jump just a few inches off the ground, lift your arms overhead until your hands are about shoulder width apart.








, As you jump, open your legs wider than shoulder width as you lift your arms overhead. Give or take some space depending on your height and leave a wide amount of space between your feet.









Slightly bend your joints throughout the entire movement.
To avoid injury, keep your joints loose. Don’t hold your arms stick-straight, but keep them slightly bent. The same goes for your knees.

, After jumping in the air, gently land in the first position with arms at your sides and feet shoulder width apart.








, You won’t get much benefit out of performing one jumping jack. Use them as a way to warm up before a more intense workout, or as a cardio workout itself. Repeat for 10 to 20 minutes depending on your level of fitness.








Perform jumping jacks as a quick five minute warm-up if you're new to working out.
Jump longer to get your heart rate up during a warm-up if you're used to cardio work.
A jumping jack warm-up may feel like a workout itself if you're not especially fit. That's okay. Keep practicing them daily.

, Rotator cuff injuries have been reported from consistently doing jumping jacks over time. To avoid injury, perform half jacks, which are done the same as regular jumping jacks, but don’t bring your arms all the way overhead. Only lift them to shoulder height and bring them back down.








, To really feel the burn of a jumping jack routine, hold dumbbells while you perform them. Pick weights between 2 to 5 pounds (0.91 to 2.27 kg), because it will be hard to jump holding anything much heavier. Pick a weight that makes your body work harder, while not messing up your jumping jack form.







, Make sure you have mastered a proper jumping jack before amping up the intensity with wrist and ankle weights. Keep their weight similar to what you would use for dumbbells and perform jumping jacks slower with them on. 







, To get more out of a jumping jack routine, try to perform them as quickly as possible. As soon as you land back on the ground, jump right back up.








, Stretching is important in any exercise to avoid injury. Begin with a light shoulder stretch to gently start cooling down your muscles. Hold your back up straight and bring one arm overhead. Bend this arm down at the elbow and use your other hand to grab this same elbow. Gently pull it towards the opposite side.








Stretch after you have done jumping jacks, so that your muscles are warmed up. Otherwise you risk injury.

, Your hip flexors are one of the main muscles worked in jumping jacks.To open them up before working them, place yourself in a position with hands and knees touching the ground. Slowly move your knees away from each other, while simultaneously walking your hands forward.









Hold the stretch for 30 seconds at a comfortable point.
Prop your hands up on pillows or books if you need to., Stretch another important area involved in jumping jacks by loosening up your leg muscle above the knee. Stand up straight and bend one knee backwards towards your butt. With your hand from the same side, grab the bent leg’s ankle or toes and push your foot as close to your butt as possible.

Begin in the heel stretch position with your leg extended to the side.,
Shift the extended leg to the front, keeping the hand on your heel.,
Hold the leg in front with two hands.",How to Do a Heel Stretch," Before you stretch, jog or power walk for about 5 minutes to loosen and warm your muscles.


Warming your muscles up before stretching makes them more pliable.
Stretching cold, tight muscles may decrease your strength and keep you from performing to your best ability.;
, After warming up, start stretching your muscles, paying particular attention to your legs.


Your legs will be doing most of the work, so you need to make sure they’re flexible.
To get ready for the heel stretch, you should be doing lunges, hamstring stretches, and split stretches.
You’ll also need to do a few arm stretches to prepare yourself.

, This will warm and stretch your leg muscles even more, and will also help prepare your leg for a high kick.


Kick your leg back and forth, like you would kick a ball.Practice these kicks for about 15-20 repetitions.Try to kick higher each time.

, Stand with your feet together and your legs straight, then kick your leg as high as it will go.

, If you’re kicking your left leg, catch it with your left hand. If you’re kicking your right leg, catch it with your right hand.


Most beginners won’t be able to do this on the first try. Start by grabbing the heel that will be in the air, do a quick dip, and pull the leg up. This will help you practice the move until you get more advanced.
It also helps to have a partner stand in front of you if you’re a beginner. Then you can put your leg on your partner’s shoulder, and when you’re ready, have them move away until you’re holding the pose on your own.
Your hand should be on the bottom outside of your heel.
Do not grab your toes. It will make you lean forward, which is not proper form.

, Your leg should be parallel to your torso, or at a 45 degree angle from your body.


This requires some balance, so don’t feel bad if you stumble or drop your leg.
If your legs are long, this will require some extra flexibility.

, This will help you straighten your leg and remain stable.


Do not turn your leg out from the knee, as this can cause serious injury.

, The hand not holding your leg should be closed into a fist.


Pulling the other arm into the “High-V” is the correct way to do the move stylistically, but it also helps you keep your balance.

, Your knee should be unlocked but straight, and your body should be tight.


Locking your knee can be dangerous. Keep it very slightly bent to avoid injury.
Keeping your core tight will help you maintain your balance while holding the heel stretch.

, Focus on the muscles in your lower body and the posture of your upper body in order to stay balanced.


The foot on the floor should be firmly planted. Your body weight should be evenly distributed through the heel, ball, inner, and outer sides of the foot.The thigh and calf muscles in your standing leg should be held firm and straight. Tighten these muscles to keep from wobbling or jutting your hip out.
Your back should be straight with your chest and chin held up. Keeping the upper body strong and lifted will help you stay balanced., When done properly, the heel stretch should look easy and graceful., Prepare to move the extended leg forward by dropping the hip down.


This move is intended for advanced cheerleaders who have perfected the side heel stretch.

, Use the hand holding your heel to help move your leg around to the front of your body.


This movement is more difficult and requires extreme balance and strength.
Do not bend either leg when moving the leg front. Keeping the leg straight will force the hips to shift down and straighten.

, Move the other arm out of the “V” fist position and use both hands to grip the bottom of the foot, holding the leg straight in front.


The leg should stay long and extended straight up.

Make sure the legs are even so the table doesn't wobble, and that it won't slide if you move on it. You also can use a weight bench.When choosing the correct height, keep in mind that the exercise will be easier if you can rest your feet firmly on the floor than it would be if your feet are dangling over the edge. The taller the table, the more challenging the stretch will be.;
, Sit on one end of the top of the table and lie back. Make sure the table or bench you're using is long enough, and slide down until the edge of the table is behind your knees and your feet are hanging off the side.You can make the exercise more challenging by moving closer to the edge of the table, so that less of your legs are supported. No matter how close to the edge you are, keep your thighs parallel to the floor and your knees at right angles.

, Grasp one of your knees and pull it toward you, bending your leg as you do. Focus on keeping your other leg flat against the table. Only pull your leg as close to your chest as you can without pain or discomfort., You should feel a stretch in the upper thigh and hip of the leg resting on the table. Hold this stretch for a minute to a minute and a half. Breathe deeply and keep your hold steady rather than pulsing., Lower your leg in a slow, controlled motion. After taking a few deep breaths, you're ready to do the same stretch with the other leg. Notice any differences between how the stretch feels on one leg versus the other."

Lying.",How to Recognize a Food Addiction," Often people who have this condition live in guilt when they eat. Eating may be pleasurable for them but they are ashamed to “admit” the need for this pleasure from food. The guilt is due to a feeling that they are doing something wrong. It is possible someone may eat a pint of ice cream and then feel a tremendous amount of guilt after eating it. This may be a sign of a food addiction.;

Get in sync with Mother Nature through naturopathy by knowing what naturopathy treatment is all about.,
Pamper your tired body.,
Bring your awareness to your breath.,
Understand that we have more than just a physical body.,
Take up yoga and stay fit.,
Practice yoga regularly.,
Drink lots of water throughout the day.",How to Bring Peace Into Your Life Through Naturopathy and Yoga Treatment," The concept of naturopathy finds its roots in ancient Indian wisdom where it speaks of the five great elements. These elements are present in the world in the form of  earth, water, air, fire and ether.


Naturopathy can, thus, be broadly defined as a system wherein human beings live in harmony with the principles of nature. These constructive principles are applicable on the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual planes of living. Naturopathy has great health promotive, disease preventive, curative and restorative potential.

A harmony of these elements translates into health and wellbeing. Disease occurs when there’s a congestion or depletion of one or more elements. Naturopathy addresses the equilibrium of these elements and restores the ill body to health. Every element has a specific remedy and the degree of imbalance requires a combination of treatments.

;
, Steam bath, infrared sauna, Vibro massages, reflexology, ultrasound and tractions improve blood circulation throughout the the muscles and tissues.

, Bringing your attention to your breath causes you to take better control of activities in and around your circle of influence. As you get to balance the rhythm in your breathings, you are better empowered to take charge of your actions and are more calm, composed and equipoised.

, In addition to our physical bodies, there is also the energy body or bioplasmic body . While the aura energy is invisible to the naked eye, however, it can be seen with Kirlian photography. Besides, there were eleven chakras in our bodies. The proper functioning of each was very important for the healthy and correct functioning of  the corresponding body parts.

, Yoga is a discipline to develop one’s inherent powers in a balanced manner.


Studies reveal that yoga is an excellent promoter and sustainer of good health. It increases flexibility, endurance, improves digestion, reduces stress, helps combat insomnia, weight problems and more.

, Yogas are exercises that basically harmonize and synchronize the  body rhythm, breath and spirit of the person. Thus, restoring peace and serenity of the natural balance is important.


Practicing Surya Namaskar, Asanas, Pranayams, Mudras, Bandhas, Dyana or Kriya, meditation or Dhyana in a disciplined manner can do you wonders.

, Water is the purest way of flushing out toxins from your body and revitalizing it. Drinking lots of it already takes care of most of the problems.

Be aware of the two different types of contortionists.,
Warm up before you do any stretching.,
Practice leg stretches.,
Try hip stretches.,
Practice full splits.,
Do backbends.,
Practice contortion stretches at least one hour a day.,
Try the scorpion pose.,
Do rising and falling back bends.,
Try bent leg splits.,
Practice the chin stand pose.,
Work on contortion poses at least one to three hours a day.,
Watch example videos online.,
Join a contortion class.,
Get one on one training with a contortion coach.",How to Become a Contortionist," There are two different types of contortionists: front benders and back benders. These two types are based on the contortionist’s ability to hyperextend her spine. A front bender is often better at forward bending and a back bender is often better at back bending.Women are known to be good back benders, but men can also develop flexibility in back bending positions with enough practice. The younger you are, the easier!
Many contortionist incorporate their type of contortion into a performance, moving from contortion posture to contortion posture as part of a routine or a dance. With enough practice and dedication, you can start to create your own contortion routine, showcasing your best postures.;
, Make it a habit to always warm up before you get into any contortion stretching. This will prevent you from getting injured and allow your muscles to warm up and become more flexible.Start by twisting and stretching your joints. Do this by doing a full range of motion for every joint in your body, from rotating your neck and head to twisting your wrists and ankles. Be gentle when doing this, as you only want to stretch your joints, not stress them out.
Do at least thirty minutes of cardio exercise. This could be jogging, running, jumping jacks, or rowing. Your muscles are more flexible when your body temperature is one to two degrees higher than normal. Get your heart rate going and break a little sweat with cardio so you can then ease into your stretches.

, Leg stretches will help your muscles prepare for contortion movements that require a wide range of motion in your legs and hips.Start by putting weight into your right leg, with your toes firmly on the exercise mat. Slowly raise your left leg, gripping your big toe with your left thumb and forefinger.
Raise your left leg as high as you can, stretching your leg to the ceiling. If possible, try to straighten your left leg until it is vertical and wrap your left hand and right hand over your leg. This will help you build flexibility in your leg muscles.
Repeat these steps for your right leg, stretching your right leg to the ceiling.

, Open up your hips so they feel ready for contortion movements. These hip stretches are similar to yoga hip openers, where you focus on breathing deeply in a hip opening pose for several breaths.Start in a lunge position, with your left leg extended behind you. Make sure your right knee does not extend past your ankle and that your left leg is balanced on the ball of your left foot. Slowly rock back and forth, feeling the stretch in your right and left hip. Place your hands on the inside of your right foot and lower your left leg until your knee, shin, and foot are flat on the mat.
Inhale and slowly lower on your hands as far as you can go, whether this is upright on the palms of your hands, bent at the elbows, or on your forearms. Inhale and exhale as you feel the stretch in your hips, holding this pose for six to eight breaths.
Come out of the pose the same way you went in, by coming back onto your hands and tucking your back leg. Then, bring your back left leg to meet your right leg and end in a forward fold position.
Repeat this stretch on your left side, with your right leg extended behind you.

, The splits will help you stretch your leg and hip muscles. Depending on your level of flexibility, you may be able to only go halfway down in the splits or you may be able to touch the ground in the splits. If you are still working on getting all the way to the ground, you should continue to work on your splits as part of your daily stretching routine.To go into the full splits, you should start with your right leg facing forward, with your left leg three to four feet behind your right leg. Slowly inch your legs in opposite directions until you can place your hands on either side of your right leg with your palms flat on the mat.
Use your hands for support as you continue to inch your legs in opposite directions until your pelvis reaches the mat and you are in the full splits. Extend your hands and face forward. Breathe in this position for six to eight breaths.
Then, come out of the splits by placing your hands on either side of your pelvis. Use your arms to help you pull your legs together and bend them behind you. Come back into the center of the mat and slowly rise to standing.
Repeat these movements on the other side, with your left leg facing forward and your right leg behind you.

, Back bends are a great way to strengthen your back muscles and improve your flexibility. Many contortion poses require flexible back muscles and back bends are a good way to do this in a safe way.Begin on your back, with your legs bent and an arms length away from you. You can measure this by stretching out your hands to ensure you can touch the backs of your feet.
Place your hands on either side of your head, with your palms flat on the mat. Inhale as you put weight into your legs and arms, raising your head off the ground. Rest for a breath on the top of your head, with no weight in your head, and then use your arms and legs to push yourself up into a backbend.
Hold the backbend for six to eight breaths, making sure your head is relaxed and you are putting equal weight into your arms and legs. You should feel a stretch in your back muscles.
When you are ready to come out of the pose, tuck your chin to your chest and slowly lower your back down to the mat. Sway your legs from side to side for a breath and try another backbend. However, try not to overextend your back muscles and only do another backbend if your body appears open to the idea.

, Many contortionist do contortion stretching at least one to three hours a day to ensure their bodies stay flexible. You can start by committing to one hour a day of stretching and then slowly increase this amount to three hours a day, breaking it up so you stretch one hour in the morning, one hour in the afternoon, and one hour in the evening.Skipping or missing one day of stretching can actually reduce your flexibility and increase the amount of time it takes you to do certain contortion poses.

, This is a basic contortion pose that requires the stretching of your legs and your back. Always do leg and back stretches before trying this pose.Begin with your left foot firmly planted on the exercise mat and raise your left arm to shoulder level. You will use your left arm to help you stay balanced and focused in this pose.
Raise your right foot and bend it at the knee. Grip your right toes with your right hand and slowly extend your right foot out and upward. Maintain your balance by looking at the tips of your left hand as you extend your right foot.
Continue to extend your right foot until it is at its highest point. Raise your left hand and bring it over your head to meet your right hand and your right foot. You are now in a basic scorpion pose.
To extend the scorpion pose further, slowly walk your right hand and your left hand down your right foot until they grip your right shin. Extend your right leg until it is completely straight. You are now in a full scorpion pose, a common contortionist pose.
Repeat the same steps on your left side with your left leg raised and extended behind you.

, This is a variation on a standard backbend that will help you to build flexibility in your back muscles and strengthen your abdominal muscles.Begin with your legs hip width apart on the mat and your arms extended over your head. Make sure your arms are stiff and strong as this will prevent you from falling on your head when you fall into the backbend.
Look at your fingertips and keep your arms straight and strong as you let your arms and your gaze move behind you. Continue to look at your fingertips as your hands reach the mat behind you.
Once you are in a backbend, put even weight in your heels and slowly raise your arms off the mat. Try to find a center of balance so both arms can hang at your sides as you are upside down. Wrap your right hand around your right knee and wrap your left hand around your left knee for a nice back stretch.
To do a rising back bend, place your hands back on the mat and use your abdominal muscles to slowly pull your upper body back up into a standing position.

, This is a variation on full splits that allows you to show off your flexibility and add a cool looking contortion move to your repertoire.Start by going into the full splits on your right side, with your right leg extended forward and your left leg extended backward.
Raise your right arm and reach it back behind you. Inhale as you slowly bend your left leg and wrap your right arm around your left foot. Place your left foot on your forehead, extending your neck back as well. Hold this pose for one to two breaths and then move out of the splits.
Repeat these movements on the left side, with your left leg extended forward and your right leg extended backward. You will then raise your left arm and wrap it around your bent right foot.

, This pose is one of the more advanced backbend contortion poses and a real show stopper. You should work very slowly through this pose and always warm up your back muscles before attempting it.Begin by doing a falling backbend. Then, walk your arms forward between your legs until you can place your chin on the mat. Keep your arms bent by your head and make sure there is very little weight on your chin.
Let your chest and back muscle support you as you raise your hands off the ground. If you are comfortable in this position, you can place your arms back on the ground and work on raising your legs off the ground. Over time, you want to work on bending your legs and placing your toes on the top of your head.
To get out of this position, you will tuck your arms into your sides and raise your legs off the ground until they are back behind you. Rise up on your elbows and slowly come back to seated or stay on your stomach and rest for a moment.

, Similar to stretching, contortion poses require a lot of practice on a consistent basis. Doing one to three hours a day of contortion poses can help you to build your flexibility and strength.You can also start to link each movement together to create a contortion routine. Try to move from a back bend to a full split or a falling back bend to a chin stand, for example, and time these poses to music. Over time, you can try to link together four to five poses and set them to music, allowing you to create your own contortion routine.

, There are many contortionist videos online that you can watch to get a better sense of contortionist movements and stretching. Look for videos that showcase contortion routines by trained professionals, as this will allow you to have a visual reference for your own contortion routine., Contortion classes can be found at performing arts schools, gyms, and yoga studios. Make sure the classes are taught by an experienced contortionist who uses safe and accessible exercises to deepen your stretches and movements.

, If you feel you have reached a certain point in your contortion training and are looking to try more advanced contortion movements, you may seek out a contortion coach, who is usually a contortionist themselves. A contortion coach can often be found by word of mouth in the performing arts community, online, or through an in person contortion class. Ask the instructor of your contortion class if she has any suggestions on contortion coaches who can work one on one with you."

Stretch your iliotibial band.,
Perform the seat side straddle stretch.,
Do knee to chest stretches.,
Talk to your primary care physician.,
See a physical therapist.,
Undergo surgery to correct severe problems.",How to Align Your Hips," The best person to judge this is a doctor, and self-diagnosis is not advisable. If you are unable to see your doctor or you are trying to figure out which type of doctor you should go to, you may want to do some at-home tests to see if misalignment may be an issue. Even if you are fairly certain you know the cause, there is no substitute for seeing a qualified physician, and you should make this a priority.;
, Hip misalignment can cause pain in three different distinct areas. If you experience pain in one or more of these places, your hips may indeed be misaligned:


Hips: This may seem obvious, but there are many different types of hip pain with different causes to consider. Its best to identify or feel for achy or inflamed joints by slowly moving left to right possibly in front of a mirror.
Lower back: Hip misalignment is associated with hyper-extension and tension of the muscles in the abdomen and lower back. Problems with these muscles can manifest as sore or acute lower back pain.Knee: Hip misalignment may cause you to shift too much weight to one side of your body. The knee on that side may not be able to handle the extra weight and stress, causing pain., This is a simple test you can do at home to look for obvious signs of misalignment. Wearing form-fitting clothing will make this step easier.


Stand barefoot in front of a mirror or have a friend take your picture. Try to stand straight but relaxed.
Imagine a vertical line going straight down the middle of your body.
Now, imagine a second line near your shoulders that is perfectly perpendicular to the first line.
Examine the photo for common signs of misalignment. Your pelvis may appear diagonal rather than parallel to the second line, or one leg may appear to be shorter than the other. Again, this does not qualify as a diagnosis, but it may be a helpful bit of information you can pass on to your doctor.
Repeat this process while standing in profile. You may notice an increased curve in your lower back and bulging (but not necessarily fat) abdomen. This may indicate an anterior pelvic tilt., Sometimes there is an easy-to-spot root cause of improper hip alignment that you can fix immediately.


Not stretching enough after exercise. Over time, overly tight muscles can pull the joints and bring them into misalignment.
Poor posture. Work on consciously sitting and standing straighter.
Wearing a heavy shoulder bag. Switch to a backpack to more evenly distribute the weight.
Not wearing the right shoes. If your arches are too high (sometimes caused by wearing high heels) or too low, this can alter your gait to the point of misalignment of your hips.

, Don't be confused by the name of this exercise. A pelvic tilt exercise can help to correct a pelvic tilt misalignment by uniformly strengthening your pelvic muscles.


Lie flat on the ground with your knees bent. Your arms, upper back, lower back, head, and the soles of your feet should all be touching the floor.If you are pregnant, a safe alternative is to prop your back against a wall instead of the floor.Brace your abdominal muscles, pressing your lower back against the floor or wall. Hold this position for 6 to 10 seconds while breathing normally.Repeat this exercise eight to 12 times daily., This exercise will help to evenly strengthen the muscles of your legs and lower back. Once you are able to do this exercise with minimal pain, add ankle weights to your routine. This exercise is not recommended for pregnant women.Lie face down with a pillow under your hips, legs extended straight behind you.
Contract your glutes and lift your leg slowly until your thigh is off the floor.
Lower the leg back down slowly.
Begin with six to eight repetitions daily, working your way up to 12. Repeat this exercise two to three times a week.

, This exercise strengthens the muscles of the outer sides of your upper leg and lower back. Add ankle weights to your routine as you progress.


Lie on your stronger side with your head cradled in the crook of your arm.
Bend your stronger side's leg forward slightly at the hip and knee to provide support.
Straighten your weaker side's leg and slowly lift the leg to a 45 degree angle from the floor.
Slowly lower the leg and pause to rest for two seconds.
Begin with six to eight repetitions and work your way up to 12. Repeat this exercise two to three times a week.

, The iliotibial band is a piece of connective tissue that runs from your outer pelvis, down the side of your leg, and to your knee. Misalignment of your pelvis can cause this band to become inflamed during exercise.Don't perform this stretch if you're pregnant, as the change in your center of gravity may cause you to fall.Stand next to a wall for support.
Cross one leg behind the other.
Lean on the hip of crossed-over leg towards the wall.
Once you feel a stretch, stop and hold your position for 30 seconds.
Rest for 30 seconds and change sides. Complete two reps on each side. Do this stretch once in the morning or before bed or after exercise.

, This stretch pulls the muscles of the outer hip, targeting the glutes.


Sit on the floor with your legs spread apart, your back as straight and tall as possible.
Turn your shoulders (but not your hips) toward one leg and hinge forward at the hips, leaning over the extended leg. Make sure both your butt cheeks stay on the floor.
Hold that position for 30 seconds.
Rest 30 seconds before repeating the stretch on the other side. Do a total of 2 repetitions on each side (for a total of four) daily.

, This type of stretch will balance posterior hip muscles. It is safe for pregnant women and is specifically recommended to help with pregnancy-related hip pain.Lie on your back. Your knees should be bent and your feet flat on the floor.
Move one knee as close to your chest as possible while keeping your lower back pressed to the floor.
Hold this position for 30 seconds.
Relax and lower your leg.
Rest for 30 seconds before repeating with your other knee. Perform this stretch once or twice a day. First thing in the morning or before bed are good times to stretch, or do it right after you exercise., If you have access to healthcare, a qualified medical professional is the best person to diagnose and treat your hip alignment problems. If you are experiencing inflammation or pain, your doctor can prescribe the correct and safest medications to help. If your problems are outside your doctor's area of expertise, you may be referred to a specialist.

, Your doctor may refer you to a physical therapist. A physical therapist will help you regain mobility through guided exercises and stretches. Your physical therapist may also advise you on the right routine you can do at home., For hip alignment issues not treatable by exercise or medication, surgery may be required. Surgeons can alter the shape and alignment of the hip socket and joint to make it easier to move in a procedure called a periacetabular osteotomy.If your hip is severely damaged, a surgeon can resurface or completely replace your hip through arthroscopy, which is a minimally invasive surgical procedure."

Slow down.,
Don’t push through the pain.,
Avoid difficult stretches.",How to Become Flexible With Minimal Pain1," Moving quickly into a stretch is a recipe for injury. Instead, always move your body with deliberate slowness, coaxing instead of forcing your body into the stretch.


Slowly moving your body into a stretch allows you to accurately monitor how far you can go before the stretch becomes painful.If you move into a stretch too fast you won’t be able to tell precisely when the stretch became painful.;
, This advice can seem counterintuitive since most physical activities require you to push into your limits if you want to make progress. With stretching, the opposite is true. “No pain, no gain” does not apply to stretching.To find your limit, perform a stretch slowly and right up to the point where it hurts. Then, draw the stretch back until it no longer hurts. This is the sweet spot where you should hold the stretch.
Over time, you will find that your limit moves further and further into the stretch.

, The goal of stretching is to become more flexible and feel more agile and comfortable in your body. If you practice stretches that tax your body and are very difficult or painful, you will reach the opposite result.If you try a stretch and it is very difficult or painful, scrap it and substitute a different stretch.
There are many ways to stretch every muscle in your body, so don’t worry if you’re unable to perform every stretch.

Commit to a regular schedule.,
Breathe deeply.,
Stretch after a workout.",How to Become Flexible With Minimal Pain2," To improve your flexibility you need to stretch on a regular basis. Otherwise, your body will quickly return to its previous, inflexible state.Stretch five days a week for approximately ten minutes.
Don’t feel the need to “make-up” missed stretch time. Too much stretching can be counterproductive. If you miss a day, that’s OK—simply try to do better the following week.

, Deep, controlled breathing is essential for getting the most out of your stretches, and avoiding pain. Breathing deeply brings more oxygen into your lungs, which helps remove lactic acid from your muscles.Before every stretch, take a slow, deep breath.
As you move into the stretch, slowly release the breath.
When you reach the limit of your stretch take another deep breath in.
Slowly release the breath and move slightly further into the stretch. The increased oxygen in your blood should help you move further without additional pain.

, Contrary to popular wisdom, stretching is more effective and helpful if performed after a workout. This is because muscles stretch more when they’re warmed up and fatigued.After you’ve completed your aerobic or anaerobic workout, move directly into your ten-minute stretching routine.
If you don’t have time to workout before you stretch, take five minutes or so to either go for a walk or simply contract and release your muscles. Even this small amount of warm-up will improve your stretching routine.

As you descend, place your hands into a prayer position and allow your elbows to stay in contact with the inside of your knees.
Hold this stretch for 30-60 seconds.
If you feel insecure in this stretch, feel free to hold onto a stationary object in front of your as you descend. This will keep you from falling backwards.

, This stretch targets your lower back and your hamstrings. This stretch is similar to the standard “touch your toes” stretch, but it avoids forcing your back into a curved position.From a standing position, slowly bend forward, allowing your arms to hang down in front of you.
Keep your back as flat as possible as your lean into the stretch. To help with this, aim your hands for a spot on the floor one to two feet in front of you.
If you can get your hands to floor, that’s great—but don’t feel like you need to stretch this far.

Do walking lunges.,
Do straight leg kicks.,
Do arm circles.,
Do hacky-sacks.,
Do butt kicks.",How to Be Flexible1," Lunges are great for improving flexibility in your legs as they engage many of the main leg muscles, including your quads, hamstrings, glutes and calves, in addition to loosening up your hips.Incorporating a walking movement makes this stretch more dynamic. This is important as dynamic stretching has been found to be more effective than static stretching in increasing flexibility before a workout.To perform a walking lunge:









Take a big step forward, bending your front knee until it is over or slightly behind the toes. Your back knee should almost be touching the ground, while your back should remain upright and your abdominal muscles tight.
Slowly raise yourself out of the lunge and step forward with your back leg, entering into a second lunge. Use slow, controlled movements to get the most out of your stretch. Repeat 10-15 times.;
, Leg kicks are great for stretching out the hamstrings and improving hip mobility - two areas that are essential for good flexibility.Just be careful not to kick your leg too high - you should only swing as far as feels comfortable, otherwise you risk injury. As your flexibility improves you will be able to kick your leg higher. To perform a straight leg kick:









Swing your leg upward in front of you, keeping your knee straight. Bend your toes back, so you feel the stretch through your heel. Remember to keep your back straight and don't bend the knee of your supporting leg.Aim to get your leg parallel with your hip, at first, then try to get your toes parallel with your shoulder, once flexibility increases.
You can do 10-15 repetitions of this exercise using the same leg, or you can perform it using a walking motion, alternating the stretches between both legs. Think of a marching tin soldier!

, Arm circles are simple exercises with an important function - namely, loosening the shoulder joints. The shoulder joints have a higher potential range of motion than any other joint in your body - so they are a great place to start when you're looking to improve flexibility.To perform arm circles:









Stand with your feet about a shoulder-width apart and extend your arms straight out to the sides, so they're in line with your shoulders. Begin rotating your arms forward in small, circular motions, without moving your wrists or elbows. After about 20 circles, change direction and begin rotating your arms backwards.To increase the intensity of the arm circles, you can rotate your arms faster or use weighted plates or dumbbells that are light enough to allow you to do 8-10 rotations.

, The hack-sack exercise - which imitates the movement used when playing hacky-sack - is great for targeting muscle groups that are often neglected, such as those in the inner thigh. It improves leg flexibility while also increasing the heart rate and helping coordination. To perform the hack-sack exercise:









Lift your leg up, bending your knee so that it points outwards. Try to tap either your ankle or the inside of your foot with the opposite hand, without bending forwards.Repeat 10 to 15 times on each leg. Incorporate a hopping motion to increase intensity.

, Butt kicks are a type of dynamic stretch which mainly target the quadriceps muscles, along with stretching the hip flexors. They can be performed while walking or jogging and are a great way to warm up before doing any exercise that involves running.To perform butt kicks:









Bend your knee backwards in an exaggerated motion, until your heel hits your glutes. Your knee should be pointing towards the floor and form a straight line all the way to your torso. Repeat the exercise with the other leg, using either a walking or jogging movement. Do 10 to 15 repetitions with each leg.
Don't worry if your heel cannot quite reach, it is quite common to have a limited range of motion with this movement. You should be able to complete the exercise once your flexibility increases.

Point your feet and place your hands on the ground in front of you to balance yourself. You should feel this stretch in your hips and your inner thighs.Stay in this stretch for fifteen seconds.
Try to open your legs wider each time you do this stretch. The goal is to eventually be able to do a split.;
, Sit on your bottom with your legs extended in front of you and your arms lifted straight overhead. Fold at your waist and reach your arms towards your toes.Stay in this stretch for fifteen seconds.
You may not be able to reach your toes right away. Keep trying and as you get more flexible, you’ll get closer and closer to touching them.

, Stand with your left leg in front of you and your right leg behind you. Bend your left leg at a 90 degree angle, and rest your right leg on the ground to support yourself. Rest your hands on your left leg and use them to push your left leg even deeper into the stretch.Stay in your left lunge for 15 seconds.
After 15 seconds, switch and do the same thing on your right side.

, Stand with your feet apart (they should be slightly wider than your shoulders). Reach your right arm across your body, and use your left arm to support it and lock it into place.Pull your arm tight until you feel a stretch in your shoulder.
Hold your arm stretch for ten seconds, before alternating and doing the same stretch on the left side.

, Stand with your feet apart (they should be slightly wider than your hips) and your arms outstretched.

Use the runner's stretch to combat hip and knee pain.",How to Create a Morning Stretching Routine1," In just five to ten minutes, you can relieve common morning stiffness, as well as increase your flexibility over time. Stretching your neck is a good place to start, and will help you transition from a prone to an upright position.Simply lean your head sideways, bringing your right ear close to your right shoulder. You can use your right hand to help deepen the stretch, but be gentle and don't force your head over more than is comfortable.
Practice deep breathing and hold the stretch without pulsing, then release and repeat the stretch on your left side.
You also can do this stretch by lifting and lowering your chin to stretch the front and back of your neck. Do a few forward neck rolls as well. Only roll your neck forward and from side to side in a half-circle motion. Don’t roll your neck backwards or you may hurt yourself.;
, Depending on your sleeping position, you may have pain or stiffness in your chest, back, and shoulders when you wake up in the morning. Chest and upper back stretches allow tense muscles to relax.To stretch the back of your shoulders, stand and reach your arms out in front of you, pressing your palms together. Lower your chin to your chest and pull your shoulder blades away from each other, feeling the stretch in your upper back.
To stretch your chest, turn your hands so your palms are facing forward. Then, reach both of your arms wide out to the sides at waist height and pull the shoulder blades together. Or, you can also try standing in a doorway with your hands on the walls on either side of the door. This will give your chest a good stretch.
Only go into these stretches as far as you can with comfort. If you feel any pain, stop stretching immediately – don't force yourself to stretch your muscles beyond their limits.

, Particularly if you work out on a regular basis, stretching your arms and shoulders in the morning is essential. Your shoulders are a delicate joint, and these stretches help improve your mobility.To stretch the back of your shoulder, stand and extend your right arm in front of you and across your chest. Pull it close with your left hand and hold it as close across your chest as you comfortably can. Take care not to pulse or bounce, and don't force it. Release and repeat the stretch with your left shoulder. You can do this three to five times if necessary to further stretch your shoulders.
To stretch for the triceps in the back of your arms, raise your right arm above your head and let your hand drop behind your left shoulder. Grasp your elbow with your left hand and gently push your elbow back. After holding this position for a breath or two, switch and do your other arm. This will stretch your triceps.

, You can improve your posture by increasing the flexibility of your core muscles. Stretching your sides will lengthen your muscles and improve your overall stability, as well as stretching your lower back.To do a hip flexion stretch, hold onto the back of a chair. Then, step backwards two steps and bend forward at your hips, letting your elbows point down to the floor.If you can't bend forward very far without discomfort, just lean over as far as you can, keeping your back flat and straight.
While standing, plant your feet about hip-width apart and wrap your left hand around your right wrist, then raise your arms over your head. Gently pull your right arm towards your left side in a side stretching motion. Then, return to the center and repeat the movement on the other side.
From a seated position, extend one leg straight in front of you and cross the other leg over top of it, so your knee is bent and your foot is flat on the floor. Rotate your torso towards the crossed leg either by grabbing that leg or by resting your elbow on the outside of that knee. Keep your back straight and long. Come back to center, then repeat the stretch on the other side.

, Keeping the muscles in your legs loose is essential, especially if you're a runner. Stretching the muscles in your lower body also can help to keep your joints loose and prevent ankle and knee injuries, as well as relieving foot, leg, and back pain.You can stretch your calves simply by leaning against a wall or chair. Keep your feet shoulder-width apart and lean into the chair or wall with your knees straight. Focus on pressing your heels into the floor to deepen the stretch.
Move your feet together and bend your right knee backward. Grab the top of your foot with your right hand and gently push your right foot towards you, keeping your body straight. This will stretch your quadriceps. Hold for a few breaths, then release the stretch and repeat the action on the other side.

, If you find your hips or knees are stiff in the morning, this stretch can help open your hips and improve your overall flexibility. As the name suggests, the runner's stretch can help prevent injuries common in people who run frequently.While on all fours, jump or walk your right foot forward in line with your fingers. Your knee should be directly over your ankle. Extend your left leg behind you, with your toes and knee on the floor.
Breathe into the pose, focusing on lengthening and straightening your spine and thrusting your hips forward. On exhale, switch sides and repeat.
Relax your upper body over your front leg and take a breath or two before you switch sides.
Hold the stretch for a few breaths, then raise up and repeat the stretch with your other leg. You can repeat this several times as necessary.

",How to Be Flexible2," Hamstrings stretches are an example of static stretching, which is great for increasing flexibility while the body is cooling down after a workout. To perform a hamstring stretch, sit down on the ground and extend your left leg straight in front of you. Bend your right leg so that that the sole of your right foot rests against your left knee. Bend forward while attempting to grasp your left ankle with both hands. Hold the stretch for approximately ten seconds, then repeat on the other leg.








Once your flexibility increases, you can intensify this stretch by attempting to lock your fingers around the sole of your foot, rather than grabbing your ankle.

, To perform a calf stretch, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, facing a wall. Place both palms flat against the wall, at shoulder height. Bend your right knee and slowly move your left leg backwards, until you feel a stretch in your calf muscle. The heel of your left foot should remain firmly against the ground and the leg should be completely straight. Hold the stretch for about ten seconds, then repeat with the other leg.









Remember to keep your spine straight and your hips squarely facing the wall while doing this exercise, otherwise you won't get the full benefit of the stretch., This exercise stretches the groin area and the inner thighs. To perform it correctly, sit on the ground and bend your legs so that the soles of your feet rest against each other. Your knees should be pointing up and out to the sides. Hold an ankle in each hand and rest your elbows on your knees. Using your elbows, exert a downward pressure on your knees, until you feel the stretch in your groin and inner thighs. Hold this position for approximately ten seconds. Repeat, if desired.As your flexibility increases, you will eventually be able to touch your knees to the ground - though this may take some time.

, To perform this stretch, extend one leg in front of your torso and the other leg behind, placing a hand either side of your body for support. Slowly lower yourself as far into the stretch as you can go. You should feel a significant stretch, but it should not be painful. Hold the position for ten to thirty seconds. Repeat with the opposite leg in front, to stretch both sides equally.









Although you will probably be unable to achieve a full front splits until your flexibility increases dramatically, practicing the movement helps to stretch the hamstring and iliopsoas muscles and is a great way to work on your flexibility, while seeing measurable results., To get into position for this stretch, lie down facing the ground, then prop yourself up on your toes and elbows. Your elbows should be directly under your shoulders and the palms of your hands should be flat on the ground, pointing straight ahead. Make sure your spine is straight, forming a line from your head down.To do the stretch:









Lift your right arm off the ground and point it straight ahead, until you feel the stretch in your core. Hold the stretch for ten seconds, then return to your starting position. Repeat with your left arm.When you have finished with your arms, lift your right leg off the ground and stretch it out directly behind you, toes pointing towards the ground. Hold for ten seconds, then repeat with the opposite leg.Next, simultaneously lift your right arm and leg off the ground and stretch them both together. Hold the stretch for ten seconds before returning to the starting position. Repeat with the left arm and leg., To perform this stretch, place your feet slightly more than shoulder-width apart and bend your knees slightly. Interlock your fingers, palms facing outward, and stretch your arms out in front of your chest at shoulder-height. You are performing the exercise correctly if you can feel a slight stretch between your shoulder blades. Hold for ten to fifteen seconds.








Allow your upper back to relax, in order to really get the full benefit of this stretch.

Stretch regularly.,
Breath properly.,
Stay hydrated.,
Stretch warm muscles.,
Focus on specific muscle groups.,
Stop immediately if you feel any pain.",How to Be Flexible3," Stretching can help you to significantly improve your flexibility, but only if you do it regularly. This is because stretching is all about keeping the muscles loose and limber - if you wait too long between stretching sessions, your muscles will tighten up again, leaving you right back where you started. For this reason, it is much better to do short but regular bursts of stretching than an hour-long weekly session.








Try incorporating 20 minutes of stretching into your workout routine, five times a week.
To gain maximum benefits, break these 20 minutes up into 10 minutes of dynamic stretching before a workout and 10 minutes of static stretching post-workout.

, Breathing fully and deeply can noticeably improve your stretching sessions. Breathing deeply increases the oxygen flow to your bloodstream, improving circulation and removing harmful toxins and lactic acid from your muscles. This loosens up your muscles, making them easier to stretch. Inhaling deeply also helps your body to relax and really focuses your mind on the task at hand.Concentrate on breathing from your belly, rather than your chest. If you're doing this correctly, your stomach should inflate each time you take a breath. This engages the diaphragm, allowing for optimal oxygen intake.Inhale slowly through the nose and out through the mouth, in a measured, controlled fashion. Focus on the muscle or muscles that you're stretching as you breath - this awareness will help the muscles to relax even further as you exhale., Keeping your body hydrated is important for any form of physical activity and stretching is no exception. Muscles are mainly composed of water, so without adequate hydration muscles will fail to operate at peak levels. If your muscles are not working at an optimal level, you will fail to get the most from your stretches and find it more difficult to improve flexibility. Make sure to drink plenty of water before and during a workout to prevent dehydration.Drinking sports drinks is another way to rapidly improve hydration levels after a tough workout, while replacing lost energy and electrolytes.

, Stretching is most beneficial when performed on warm, even slightly tired muscles. It is for this reason that traditional, static stretching is best performed after a workout than before. Even your pre-workout dynamic stretches should be preceded by 30 seconds of jumping jacks or running on the spot to get the blood flowing and the muscles ready to go.If you want to stretch but don't have time for working out, don't worry. You can also effectively warm muscles by contracting and releasing them:









Just hold the specific muscle that you want to stretch in a contracted state for a minimum of 30 seconds, before releasing and moving into your stretch. Your muscle will automatically feel more relaxed., Stretching works most effectively when you target specific muscles or muscle groups individually, rather than trying to stretch them all at once. A properly performed stretching exercise will isolate just one muscle or group of muscles, so you can focus all of your energy where it's needed. The combined effect of each individual stretch will produce higher flexibility levels overall, than stretches which attempt to work several muscles at once.








Therefore, to improve overall flexibility, you will need to develop a routine of at least 5-6 different stretching exercises, which target specific areas of the body, in order to increase the flexibility of each individual muscle.

, Stretching should never be painful, and if it is you are either pushing yourself too far or performing the exercise incorrectly. Increasing your flexibility is a process - you will not suddenly achieve it overnight. As a result, you need to ensure that you are performing your stretches in a safe, controlled manner, without putting your muscles at risk of pulling or tearing.









If you feel pain while stretching, stop immediately or at the very least reduce the intensity of the stretch - pushing yourself to stretch further than your body feels comfortable with will only do more harm than good.

Jump to separate your feet, while simultaneously lifting your arms overhead. Then jump your feet back together, while simultaneously returning your arms to your sides.Do fifteen jumping jacks in a row to get your blood pumping.
As you get older and stronger, you may want to increase the number of jumping jacks you do.

, Stand with your legs slightly wider than your hips. Lift your arms overhead, then make a circle with your arms going towards your hips, then up over your head.Keep your arms straight at all times.
Do ten arm circles going forward, then reverse and do ten backwards arm circles.

, Stand on your right foot, with your left foot in the air. Hop on the right foot, then step down on your left foot. Speed this motion up until you are able to skip.Once you are confident skipping, skip back and forth for a minute at a time.
As you get stronger and more flexible, increase the length of time that you spend skipping each day.

, Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and facing forward. Keeping the weight in your toes, slowly bend your knees and lower your body towards the ground.Pause at the ground, then slowly rise back up to your previous position and do the motion again.
Hold your arms out in front of you for balance.

Consult with your family physician.,
Make sure your shoulder is stable and functional.,
Consider light exercises and stretches before attending yoga classes.,
Pick the most appropriate yoga class.,
Ask the instructor about the best poses for the shoulders.,
Don't forget about your neck and mid-back.,
Continue with yoga for relaxation and injury prevention.",How to Use Yoga for Shoulder Pain," Shoulder joints are susceptible to various injuries involving numerous tissues, such as muscles, tendons, ligaments, cartilage, bones, nerves and blood vessels.But keep in mind that the degree of the shoulder pain is not always commensurate with the seriousness of the injury. Some serious injuries can generate only mild-to-moderate pain, whereas relatively minor sprains and strains can cause severe short-term pain. As such, get your doctor to examine your shoulder pain to make sure that it's stable enough to participate in yoga classes. Your doctor may take x-rays of the shoulder joint or send you for an MRI or CT scan to get a better idea of what's causing your shoulder pain.


Less serious causes of shoulder pain that could possibly benefit from yoga exercises / positions include mild ligament sprains, bursitis and osteoarthritis (the wear and tear type); mild-to-moderate muscle strains and contusions (bruises).
Shoulder injuries and conditions not appropriate for yoga include glenohumeral dislocations, acromioclavicular separations, inflammatory arthritis (rheumatoid), advanced osteoarthritis, nerve impingement, severely torn ligaments or tendons, and any type of bone fracture or tumor.;
, Yoga involves a number of poses or positions that put pressure on the shoulder girdle. If your shoulder pain is caused by an injury or condition that makes the shoulder joint unstable (severe arthritis, cartilage tear, nerve impingement, broken bones, dislocation), then joining a yoga class is not a good idea at all. Get your family physician, chiropractor, physiotherapist or even personal trainer at the gym to assess your shoulder for stability, which includes testing it for normal range of motion and strength.If your painful shoulder has near full range of motion and strength, then doing yoga poses that put weight on your upper body is likely okay and maybe even beneficial.
Too much movement in the shoulder joint is the hallmark sign of instability and usually caused by severely stretched or torn ligaments surrounding the joint capsule.
Reduced range of motion in the shoulder is often caused by arthritis, cartilage damage, excessive scar tissue or build-up of inflammation.

, Yoga postures require a base level of strength, flexibility, balance and coordination to accomplish.Unfortunately, many Americans are out of shape and lack the flexibility and strength to do yoga properly (at least initially), which actually increases their risk of a musculoskeletal injury. As such, if you are in average or worse physical condition, then do some light stretches and exercises for your shoulders (and other major joints such as your hips and low back) at home or at the gym before joining a yoga class. You'll reduce your risk of injury and get more out of the classes. On the other hand, if you are already fit and flexible, then you may need such preparation.


While standing, reach around the front of your body and grab the opposite elbow. Gently pull on the back of the elbow across your chest until you feel a stretch in the corresponding shoulder. Hold for 30 seconds and do at least 3x daily.
Also while standing, reach behind your back and grab the wrist of the other hand (the one with shoulder pain). Slowly pull down on the wrist until you feel a good stretch in the affected shoulder. Again, hold for 30 seconds and do at least 3x daily.
Good strengthening exercises for your shoulders include rowing, swimming, push-ups and pull-ups.
Recreational activities that can strengthen and mobilize your shoulders include tennis, bowling and archery.

, Bear in mind that there are different kinds of yoga, ranging from fairly gentle and less challenging to vigorous and very challenging. Most yoga taught in the United States is a form of hatha yoga, which involves the use of classic poses along with controlled breathing.For beginners, hatha yoga may be a little too difficult — unless you find classes tailored to total newbies. Instead, Iyengar yoga (also widely practiced in the U.S.) emphasizes precise physical alignment and makes extensive use of bolsters, blocks or blankets to help you move easily into each pose. Iyengar yoga is probably best for those with physical limitations, including the disabled, the elderly and people who don’t exercise.


Perhaps the most vigorous form of yoga is called ashtanga, as it involves assuming a series of postures called sun salutations in rapid, flowing movements.
Even yoga for beginners burns calories — at about the same rate as walking slowly — but more advanced sessions are strenuous and burn calories at similar rates to cycling.

, All the classic and modified poses in yoga challenge multiple muscle groups and joints simultaneously, so none isolate just the shoulders. Having said that, some are more challenging or stretch the shoulders to a greater extent than others. Ask your yoga instructor about the poses best suited to strengthening or stretching the shoulders and then focus on them later at home. Make sure your technique is near perfect before trying to replicate postures at home while unsupervised, otherwise injuries might result.


There are many yoga poses (almost all with unusual names!), so decide if you want to primarily stretch your shoulder muscles or strengthen then. If stretching is more your desire, then decide if your pain is more in the front, side, back or top of your shoulder area. Research poses on the internet to become familiar with them before you join a class.
Yoga poses that primarily stretch the shoulders include the Bow, Camel, Cow Face, Extended Puppy, Gate and High Lunge.Yoga poses that primarily strengthen the shoulder include the Dolphin, Half Frog, Cat, Cobra, Firefly, Handstand, Scale and Side Plank.

, Your shoulder pain may not only involve your shoulder joint and related muscles. Additionally, your neck and mid-back may also be contributing factors, so don't forget to do some yoga poses tailored for these areas also. For example, the levator scapulae muscles attach your shoulder blades to your upper neck and are a common source of pain due to ""stress neck"" and habitual postures such as computer work and driving a car. Another example is the rhomboid muscles between your shoulder blades, which are commonly strained by bad (slouching) posture.


Yoga postures great for your neck and mid-back include the Warrior, Supported Shoulderstand, Revolved Triangle, Plow and Noose, among others.It's important not to try to attain poses or postures if they are significantly increasing your shoulder pain. Some muscle ache from a good stretch is likely okay, but sharp and shooting pains are never a good sign and an indication you should stop and take a break.

, Yoga may certainly help with your mild-to-moderate shoulder pain, but it's ability to reduce stress, increase overall muscle flexibility and strength, lower heart rate and blood pressure, and relieve anxiety, depression and insomnia are all proven by studies.As such, you shouldn't look at yoga as a short-term fix for shoulder pain, but rather as a long-term lifestyle commitment to better your health and well being. If an easy short-term fix is all you want for your shoulder pain, then medications such as muscle relaxants or anti-inflammatories may be the better (and less expensive) option. Yoga takes time and commitment.


Realize that yoga in its full form combines physical poses, breathing exercises, meditation and a distinct philosophy regarding nutrition and lifestyle choices.
Remember that practicing yoga should not replace conventional medical care when it comes to musculoskeletal injuries or other health conditions.

Evaluate your own fitness facility.,
Implement a policy.,
Consistently perform random audits.",How to Have a Spotless Gym," If you wouldn’t feel 100% comfortable walking around your business barefoot (including the bathrooms and showers) you have a big cleanliness issue. If you’re paying attention, you’ll notice the moment you walk into a business whether or not, the owner values cleanliness.

Your customers may forgive you for a lot of things including a small facility, or old equipment, but they will never forgive you for an unclean or unsanitary workout environment. The reason this is strongly stressed on is because this is the low hanging fruit.
No matter your resources or your budget, you can improve the cleanliness of your gym today and it's a promise that your members will notice.



 

;
, Keeping your business clean is easy once you institutionalize cleanliness as a policy. Start by creating a cleaning checklist for your business. The columns of your checklist should represent days of the week and the rows of your checklist should represent items to clean or specific cleaning actions (such as ‘vacuum all floor mats’). Once you have a checklist, make sure that your staff follows the check list every single day.

, After your staff gets the hang of utilizing the checklists, then start performing random audits of their work. Take a checklist and randomly highlight 5-10 rows and do a walk-through with the person who is responsible for the list. For each item that you highlighted, give it a score (A-F) and when you’re done, write the cumulative score on top of the checklist. By doing random walk-throughs with your cleaning staff, they will learn how you like things cleaned and which items are of the highest priority.

Start with a spinal stretch.,
Stretch like a cat.,
Move into puppy pose.",How to Create a Morning Stretching Routine2," You can do a spinal stretch on the floor, or while sitting in bed before you even get up in the morning. This yoga pose will help you wake up and give you steady energy throughout the day.Sit cross-legged and gently press down on your knees, lengthening and stabilizing your spine. If you need cushioning, sit on a pillow or a folded blanket. As you inhale, reach your left hand over to your right knee. Lift from the crown of your head and breathe, lengthening your spine.
As you exhale, twist your torso to the right. You can hold this stretch for several breaths, focusing on lifting with every inhale and twisting more deeply with every exhale. Release to center and then repeat the twist in the other direction.

, Cats spend a lot of their time sleeping, so it stands to reason they would understand how important it is to stretch after a long period of inactivity to keep your muscles loose and maintain flexibility and agility.One way to give your back and core a good stretch is to do the yoga pose known as the cat tilt. Get on your hands and knees, with your wrists directly below your shoulders and your knees directly below your hips.
On an exhale, round your back upward, pulling your chin toward your navel. Then inhale and arch your back, lifting as you arch your back. On exhale, round your back again. Repeat the entire sequence three to five times.

, Puppies sleep just as often as cats do, and these yoga poses will help you stretch like a puppy does to maintain and increase your mobility, as well as decreasing the stiffness in your muscles after a long night's sleep.On all fours as you were for the cat tilt, press your fingers and palms firmly into the floor and lift your hips toward the ceiling, rising to your toes. Keep your knees bent and shake a little, then straighten one leg behind you, reaching your heel towards the floor.
Complete a breath, then bring your legs back together and extend the other leg using the same process.
You also can add downward facing dog here. From the same position, simply reach upward with your hips, lengthening your back. Keep your heels raised off the floor, but push through them, as though trying to lower them to the floor.

Start in mountain pose.,
Release to a forward bend.,
Lower into plank.,
Jump back to chaturanga.,
Flow into cobra.,
Push up into downward facing dog.,
Step back to a forward bend.,
Return to mountain pose.",How to Create a Morning Stretching Routine3," To begin your morning sun salutation, stand at the front edge of a yoga mat, palms pressed together in front of your chest in prayer position. Breathe deeply in through your nose and out through your mouth.Your heels should be slightly separated with the edges of your big toes touching each other. You may want to meditate for a moment in this position, focusing on your breath and clearing your mind.
On an inhale, extend your arms outward and raise them over your head. Bring your palms together and lift your eyes to focus on your thumbs.
Keep your shoulders neutral, pulling them away from your ears.

, On exhale, lower your arms to your sides and fold forward over your legs. This motion is similar to doing a swan dive into a pool of water. Move slowly and deliberately, focusing on your breath.Press your fingertips to the floor in line with your toes. If you can't reach that far, you can bend forward with your palms pressed together in front of your chest, rest your palms on your shins, or place a yoga block in front of you and rest your hands on it.
As you inhale, flatten your back and lift your gaze. However, if you cannot flatten your back comfortably, then do not attempt this move. If you need to put your palms on your shins so you can fully flatten your back, do so. Focus on keeping your back very flat and straight, as though your back were a table.
Do not attempt this motion if you have osteoporosis or an arthritic spine.

, As you exhale, plant your palms firmly on the floor and jump or gently step back into plank position. Your shoulders should be aligned above your wrists, and your back should be flat. You should be able to draw a straight line from the top of your head down to your heels.If you can't hold the plank position, you also can lower to your knees rather than keeping your legs straight and being on your toes.
Inhale while still in plank – you can take several breaths if you feel like you need to, breathing into the position. Focus on lengthening your spine and firming up your core.

, On exhale, lower from plank so that your knees, chest, and chin are touching the floor. Your elbows should be bent, squeezing against your ribs. Focus on keeping your hips and thighs off the floor.There is a more advanced version of this pose in which you keep your entire lower body off the floor while still bending your elbows along the sides of your body, much like your position when you're doing push-ups.
If you're trying to do the more advanced version, lower to your knees if you start to get tired or stiff – don't force yourself to hold this position if it becomes painful.

, On inhale, drop your legs to the floor and push forward, raising the front of your body into the low cobra position. Try not to press too deeply into your hands, instead thinking of the motion as lifting up.Bend your elbows outward slightly so you can roll your shoulders away from your ears, then straighten your arms to raise your upper body into an upward facing dog position.
Your legs should be straight behind you with your knees and thighs off the floor. Make sure your palms are pressed firmly into your mat directly below your shoulders, with your fingers pointed forward.

, On exhale, push backward, raising your hips and rolling over your toes to reach downward facing dog. If the single movement is too difficult for you, add an intermediate step of coming to your hands and knees first.Your heels should be raised slightly off the floor, your palms firm and flat in front of you. Spread your fingers and make sure your back is straight and flat.
Downward facing dog is a good resting pose. If you need to rest at this point, you can stay in this position for several breaths, focusing on lifting up toward the ceiling, away from your wrists, and pushing down through your heels.

, On an exhale, step or jump your right foot forward, then bring your left foot forward as well. Your feet should be just behind your hands, in the same forward bend that you were in at the beginning of the sun salutation.If you decide to jump forward, bend your knees on an exhale and propel your lower body forward, aiming to land your feet just behind your hands with your toes pointed toward your fingertips.
As you inhale, raise to a flat back and lift your chin to gaze forward. Keep your shoulders rolled down against your back, pulling them away from your ears.
Breathe through the pose, focusing on keeping your back as flat and long as possible.

, On an inhale, stand tall and reverse the swan dive you did at the beginning of the sun salutation, bringing your arms out and up. Press your palms over your head, lifting your eyes to gaze at your thumbs.On an exhale, firm up your legs in mountain pose and lower your arms, bringing your palms together in front of your chest in prayer position.
You can consider this the end of your morning stretching routine, or you can do several sun salutations in a row.
For a more challenging and invigorating routine, you might consider doing five sun salutations with a breath for each movement, flowing through the routine at a brisk pace without stopping. Only go at this speed when you're comfortable with each of the poses and know you can do them with proper form and don't need any intermediate steps to move from one pose to the next.

Do yoga.,
Take up pilates.,
Try dance classes.,
Eat healthily.",How to Be Flexible4," Yoga is great, low-intensity way to increase flexibility while relaxing the mind and improving overall feelings of well-being. Yoga combines static stretching exercises which involve holding a pose for a number of seconds - such as the Warrior or Forward Bend - along with slow, flowing sequences which stretch the body as it moves.







, Pilates is a more intensive form of stretching exercise than yoga, which has become extremely popular in recent years. Pilates works on increasing flexibility and endurance all over the body, with particular emphasis on strengthening the core. If you attend one or more pilates sessions a week, you can expect to see a dramatic increase in your flexibility in quite a short space of time.







, Dance classes can be a really fun way of improving your flexibility, especially if you try types of dance which incorporate a wide range of movement, such as ballet, zumba or salsa.Find out what kind of dance classes are offered in your local area and rope in a partner or friend to come with you. You'll have so much fun your flexibility will increase without you even realizing!








, Eating healthy, while not directly related to increasing flexibility, will help keep your body in good shape overall, thus allowing you to get more out of your stretching sessions and workouts. Eating right also helps to keep your muscles trim and lean, which will optimize their potential flexibility.


Try to incorporate more lean protein, like chicken and fish into your diet, along with plenty of fruit and vegetables, and complex carbohydrates like wholegrain cereals and bread and rice.
Avoided junk food which will leave you feeling bloated and sluggish, making stretching routines uncomfortable.

Jump in there!,
If you have a tendency to back out of these types of appointments or situations, have a gym employee make a note that you need to receive a reminder call the day before your scheduled time slot.,
Join a class.,
On the first day of your class, arrive about ten minutes early.,
Take a position in the front of the class so you can be sure to hear the instructor and so you can watch the movements closely.,
Go to the gym at the same time every day.",How to Feel Comfortable at a New Gym," The day you sign your gym contract, take advantage of the free orientation session with a personal trainer. Most gyms offer this service. Sign up for an appointment that occurs no later than one week after you join.;
, Tag team that phone call with a call from a motivating friend or partner, someone who will encourage you.

, Take a look at the schedule and pick a class that interests you. Be sure to look at the level of experience. Stick to beginner classes if you are new to working out all together.

, This way, you can introduce yourself to the instructor and let her know that you are a brand new member.

, You will feel more confident if you learn the correct way to work out. Strike up a conversation with someone around you. Ask about the class, the gym, or whatever inspires you.

, You will begin to recognize the employees and the regulars at the gym. If you are unsure of how to use a machine, or if you need assistance, it is much easier to ask for help when you see a familiar face.

Walk in the door (the hardest part).,
Warm up.,
Do less.,
Limit yourself to six to nine machines and twenty to thirty minutes.,
Rotate among upper body, core (mid-section) and legs.

,
Work major muscle groups.,
Hop on the elliptical for 10 to 20 minutes and optionally switch to the treadmill for another 5 to 20.,
Reward yourself with a few minutes in the pool, steam room or sauna.

,
While at home, it is important to eat a nutritionally sound diet.,
On days you skip the gym, do something else.",How to Get Fit in the Gym," No matter how tired you are, make two or three days a week mandatory in the gym. When you go doesn't matter - just do it before you get home in the evening. You need to start with a commitment. And a first step.;
, Five to ten minutes on the elliptical if you can.

, Forget about three sets (unless you really are a professional athlete). One set of ten to twenty or so is enough. There does need to be enough weight to tire the muscle without straining. For most of us less really is more. If a workout is not as tedious, it'll be easier to do on a regular basis. The concept in fitness circles is called supersets - and they really are. If you want to progress faster, rotate among a few exercises for that extra super set.

, DON'T rest between machines. Use machines rather than free weights, especially when getting started. They're designed to keep you in proper form.

,, Curls are not needed. Arms are worked indirectly by chest, back or shoulder exercises. The more slowly that you move the weight, the better. If you rush, inertia takes over and you're not working the muscle over its full range. Even slower on the negative.

, Go fast enough to sweat. No reading is allowed (it slows you down). Once you've settled into a routine, intersperse with 1 or 2 minute intense segments (interval training), where you push your heart rate an extra 10 or 20 BPM. Cool down for a few minutes. Stretch at the end of your workout. If you're up for more cardio, go for it but build up slowly.

,, Eat more veggies and fruit and fewer dense foods, especially those that are high in fat. Skip the protein bars or drinks. Protein deficiency is rare in the US. Only professional athletes and some senior citizens regularly need supplemental protein.

, Even if it's just a 10 minute walk (or two). Use the stairs instead of the elevator.
