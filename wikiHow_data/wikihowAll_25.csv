Check with your local climbing gym about their lead climbing policy.,
Expect to pay a small fee for the class and/or certification test.

,
Many gyms have quickdraws permanently attached to the walls.,
Most gyms provide lead climbing ropes for you, but occasionally you may need to provide your own.

,
Check that your harness is properly buckled, and the waist belt fits above your hip bones.,
Ensure that your partner is ready to belay you.,
Examine the route before you start climbing, thinking through not just the moves of how to climb it but looking at where each clip-in point is located.,
Tell your partner that you're about to start climbing, and wait for her go-ahead before you proceed.

,
Grasp the climbing rope near your harness and clip it through the first quickdraw.,
Continue climbing and clipping into each protection point as you go.",How to Lead Climb Indoors," Most climbing gyms require you to have a lead card or certification, but the specifics of how they carry this out vary between facilities. In particular:


Most gyms offer lead climbing classes to educate the beginner. But you might need to be able to climb at a certain level, or have certain gear, before joining the class.
If you're already an experienced climber, ask if you can demonstrate your lead climbing ability without having to take the entire class.;
,, However, you may occasionally see gyms where you must provide your own quickdraws and clip them into bolts in the wall as you ascend.

,, Tie into one end of the climbing rope, then double-check your knot.

, Her belay device should be clipped to the rope, several arms-lengths away from where you tied in. Double-check that her harness is also attached correctly.


Your partner should be double-checking you at the same time. 2 pairs of eyes are always better than 1.
If you're significantly heavier than your belayer, she might want to clip into a ground anchor before you start climbing.

, Considering which holds you'll use and how you'll position your body to make each clip.


Remember, you have to pull extra slack up to make each clip. Until you actually clip the rope into the carabiner, the extra slack increases your chances of taking a bigger fall and even hitting the ground. Limit your fall potential by clipping from a secure stance, with your hips as close to the clip as possible.
Sometimes you can choose from more than 1 clip-in point. Try to plan your clip-ins so that the rope ""follows"" you up the wall in as straight a line as possible; excessive zig-zagging creates a lot of rope drag.

,, One popular rope clipping technique is using your middle finger to stabilize the carabiner as you use your thumb and forefinger to guide the rope into the carabiner.


The rope should run up through the carabiner from behind, then out toward you; if the rope enters the carabiner from the front and then exits (up) behind the carabiner, this is known as back clipping and could cause the rope to come unclipped if you fall.

, When you reach the top, clip the rope into the uppermost anchor point and signal for your partner to take up the slack. Once you can feel her holding you up, sit back and prepare for her to lower you.

Shop around.",How to Know if Your Gym Membership Is Worthwhile," If you’re like most people, you probably started strong in your membership but tapered off several months after your fitness resolution. That’s OK. You might still be visiting the gym enough to make it worthwhile. First, though, you’ll need to know just how often you work out.Mark down your visits in a calendar if you don’t normally keep track. Do this for a couple of weeks to get a rough sense of how often you work out.
Take an average of your sample. For example, if you keep track of your workouts for two weeks, divide the total number by 2 to get your average visits per week. Divide by 3 if you count for three weeks.;
, Gym memberships usually cost hundred dollars for a yearly membership, with an average cost of about $55 dollars per month. You’ll want to get a sense of how much you’re paying out of pocket and how much, given your usage, you are paying per-visit.Take your total membership cost. Say that you pay $700 per year – this is your total cost, which works out to $58 per month. Divide by four again to get your cost per week: $14.50.
Now take your average visit per week. If you’re going twice per week, your cost-per-visit is the weekly price-tag divided by two, i.e. $7.25.
Note that with a fixed membership fee, you get better value with use. For example, your per-visit price drops to $3.63 if you visit four times per week.

, Gyms often have a variety of ways to pay, including day, week, or month passes in addition to yearly membership. Decide whether you are getting a good financial deal for the use you make of the gym. To do this, simply compare your cost per visit with other prices, especially periodic special offers.For example, say that your gym has a yearly rate of $650. You go three times per week and your per-visit cost on a yearly pass is about $4.51. If your gym has a special offer of $50 for a month pass, you’d end up saving about 50 cents per visit if you switch. Keep in mind, however, that such an offer won’t necessarily last.
Consider getting a Fitness Passbook. For $85, the American Health and Fitness Alliance offers passbooks of about 400 one-time admission tickets to gyms, fitness studios, and spas in major cities.

, It may seem odd, but it’s even possible that you can save by canceling your yearly membership and going pay-as-you-go. The idea is the same: compare your per visit price with the price you’d get if you bought a day pass each time you work out. Do the calculations and to see if it’s more worth your while.Say that your membership costs $800 dollars per year but you average one visit per week. That’s a per-visit cost of about $16.67. This might be more than a day pass, which will probably run between $10 and $20.
Consider, too, that this can help you commit. According to one financial advisor, people who pay as they go are actually 17% more likely to stay enrolled in a fitness program for a year than those who sign on up front., There’s more to deciding whether your gym membership is “worth it” than just the price. Namely, are you satisfied with the equipment? Does it meet your exercise needs? Ideally, you’d have done this before signing up. Now’s your chance to reassess, however.Ask yourself: is there at least one big exercise studio? You’ll want this, or else classes might get overbooked.
Does your gym have enough cardio machines for the number of regulars? Do they have free weights?

, The next question you should ask yourself is whether you are paying for “extras,” i.e. equipment that you never use but still have to cover in your membership fees. Try to keep a running list of the amenities that you use and those that you don’t use. Doing so will help you see if you’re getting “full use” out of your membership.Do you attend classes at the gym or are you only there for the machines and free weights? Why pay more if you don’t make use of one or the other?
Does the gym have a pool? Pools have a high upkeep cost, so you’re likely needlessly paying more if you don’t make use of it.
Keep a list of what equipment and amenities you use, if it helps. Do so for a week or two to get a rounded understanding of your usage.

, In other words, be willing to pick and choose what you want in order to create the best gym experience. Once you’ve surveyed the amenities, decide whether you are happy with your gym’s offerings. Then see whether you can tweak your costs. Talk to the front desk and see what options, if any, you might have.


Ask about class cards if you’re into exercise classes and don’t really use the equipment. That way, you’re only paying for the instructor and space.
If you go the gym for the equipment or pool, you might have to shop around for a place better suited to your needs.
You might also pursue your fitness goals outside the gym. You can build a good home gym and save in the long run, for example, if you really only use free weights.

, When judging your membership, another thing to keep in mind is the gym’s placement – location, location, location. Is your gym close, easy to access, and convenient for you? All of these factors can increase the value of the gym to you, even a mediocre one.


Is the gym in your neighborhood? Maybe it’s even within walking distance from your house? Consider this a big plus.
Ease of access is another bonus and can keep you working out even when you’re not feeling motivated. Is it near your workplace or on the way? Can you get there easily by transit or car?

, Like location, your gym should also ideally suit your schedule. Whether the gym has limited daytime and night time hours or is open 24/7, you should be able to work out on your time and whenever is most convenient, otherwise your membership may not be worth the price.


Do you feel like you’re able to workout on your schedule? Say that you like to drop in on your way to work in the morning. Does the gym have early hours to accommodate you?
You might also be a night owl – are the facilities open late at night for your midnight workout?

, Tally up all of the factors that go in to your membership – price, but also the use you make of the amenities and the gym’s location and hours. Is it worth your while, once you’ve weighed your satisfaction with costs? Why not shop around? There are plenty of gyms, some of which might fit you better.Commercial gyms are not necessarily the best choice. Many cities have public gyms or community centers that are subsidized and charge lower fees. Try one of these if your main qualm is price.
Look for a gym closer to your home or office if location is a deal-breaker. The closer it is, the more likely you’ll be to work out on a regular basis.
Ask each gym about their prices and plans. Make sure to find out about different access levels, weekly or monthly passes, and what the price includes, like classes. Then compare these with other gyms.

Trust your judgement.,
Clearly state what you want.,

Ignore the person.,
Talk to the staff.,
Make sure you’re being heard.,
Change your routine.",How to Handle Being Hit on at the Gym," It can be pretty annoying to have your workout interrupted. It’s even worse if a stranger is hitting on you. Clearly indicate that you are not interested in pickup lines or invitations.You can say, “No, thanks. I’m just concentrating on my workout.”
If you want, you can smile while you say no. It’s up to you on how you wish to respond, and what makes you feel most confident.;
, There’s no need to beat around the bush. Don’t try to avoid the questions, comments, or invitations. Instead, directly address what was said to you. For example, if someone comes up to you and says, “Looking good. Do you want to run together sometime?”, you can say, “No, thank you, I don’t need a new running buddy.”, When you are turning down an unwanted advance, you want to make sure that you are getting your message across. You are entitled to a peaceful work out, so make that clear. Speak confidently, and don’t waiver in you direct response.


Speak in a normal tone of voice. Don’t whisper or lower your voice.
Make eye contact. This with further convey your sincerity
If you are interested in the advance, you should also sound confident while you accept the invitation.

, If someone makes you uncomfortable, you should act on those instincts. If you feel that someone if crossing your personal boundaries, rebuff that attention. Don’t feel like you have to make polite chit chat or smile if you get a bad feeling from someone., Sometimes getting hit on doesn’t mean being asked out. That can make it more difficult to just say a firm, “No thanks.” Have a response prepared if someone gives you other unwanted attention. Make it clear that you want the attention to stop. Maybe someone comes up to you and says, “You look great doing those squats.” You can indicate what you want by saying, “I don’t want you to comment on my looks. Please leave me alone so I can finish my workout.”

, You might be able to avoid getting hit on at all. Next time you work out, try wearing headphones. This makes it clear that your attention is elsewhere and signals “Don’t talk to me.”Even if you don’t want to listen to music, you can still wear headphones. No one needs to know that you’re using them to avoid attention.

, You might notice someone trying to catch your eye. If you don’t want to interact with the person, don’t make eye contact. Sometimes direct eye contact can signal a willingness to engage.Turn your head away from the person looking at you. Look straight ahead, or focus on the machine you’re using.
Headphones can be helpful for this, too. You can always pretend your music is loud and you can’t hear someone speaking to you.

, Sometimes it’s not enough to try to handle the situation yourself. If someone is either persistent or aggressive in hitting on you, it’s time to enlist help. Remember, the staff at your gym is there to assist you. Speak up and tell them that you have a problem.You can say, “That person in the blue shorts keeps hitting on me. I come here to focus on my fitness. Can a manager speak to that person about proper gym etiquette?”

, Unfortunately, you might not get an immediate response. If the person you speak to doesn’t immediately take action, ask for confirmation that they are taking your complaint seriously. You could ask what steps they will be taking to make you feel more comfortable, and when.You could also ask to speak to the general manager.
It might be a good idea to put your complaint in writing. Send an email or a letter.

, There might be some instances where the person hitting on you just does not listen. It might not be ideal, but if you feel unsafe or uncomfortable, consider changing your regular routine.Go to the gym at a different time.
Try taking a group class instead of doing a solo workout.
Vary your schedule so that you go on different days at different times.

, Your contract lays out the exact terms and conditions, and you should be informed. You should also note if you have an annual or monthly contract.Regardless of whether you pay annually or monthly, you likely signed a 1-year contract.
Also, check to see when your contract is up. It might be easier to wait a month or two until your contract is up to cancel if you only have a couple of months left on your contract. Cancellation fees can be as much as 5 or 6 months of regular payments.

, Usually, for a monthly contract, you must cancel before the 10th of the month, as you are generally billed on the 17th, and the company needs time to process your request. For an annual contract, you must cancel before the 25th of the month prior to when you are billed. In other words, if you usually pay your annual bill in March, you need to cancel on or before February 25.Think of a fitness contract like a leasing contract. Having to give 30 days notice and fees for early cancellation are common with gyms. In fact, if you don't cancel your membership correctly, you may have to pay your contract out in total.

, If you can give written proof that you are injured or that you must move out of range of a Planet Fitness, then you may be able to have the fees waived.If you have an injury, ask your doctor's office to write a note confirming that you will be unable to use the gym facilities.Ask him or her to give a specific amount of time that you will be unable to use the gym.
If you are moving to a new place, it must be farther than 25 miles (40 km) away from any Planet Fitness location. Planet Fitness aims to transfer memberships whenever possible. Ask your employer to write a relocation letter, and make sure to map out the distance before specifying where you will be moving.

You can print off maps with your new location and the closest Planet Fitness locations marked to help your case.If neither of these situations applies to you, you will be required to pay the cancellation fee, though you can plead your case if other situations inhibit your ability to go to the gym.

Holding onto the membership is not going to make you more fit.

If your gym has a lot of classes that you rarely take, perhaps you are better off finding a gym with the bare essentials., If you are currently paying for a lot of fitness related activities, such as the gym, sports leagues, hiking trips or other physical activities, you should consider what you want to prioritize. If you can only afford one or two fitness related activities, such as a sports team and the gym or the gym and a hiking trip, you should determine what you want to spend your money on. If the gym is not on your current list of fitness priorities, you should cancel it., If you need to cut down on your monthly bills, you may want to cancel your membership. You can always pursue less costly endeavors such as running or taking daily walks., Since Crunch fitness requires you to stay for at least a year before cancelling, you should make sure you have been there for a year.

Decide on the size you want to make the box.,
Note that the advantages of angled sides is that the boxes will be stackable for storage and will be able to support a greater load, although it will make the woodworking a little more difficult.,
Buy a sheet of 3/4"" plywood big enough to cut out 4 side panels and the top piece.,
For each side panel, cut the side at 90 degrees and the top and bottom at a 10 degree angle.

,
Assemble each piece with at least 1 1/4"" drywall screws and wood glue.",How to Build Plyo Boxes," For example:


you can make a box with straight sides 20"" high, 17.5"" top, 17.5"" bottom; or






with angled sides 20"" high, 17.5"" top, 23.5"" bottom.





;
, Making plyo boxes of different heights will allow for changes in difficulty. Six inch increments are a good rule to follow (6"", 12"", 18"" and 24"")

, Multiple sheets are an option.

,, Three to five screws per panel is a good estimate. For heavier athletes, such as heavyweight boxers and mixed martial artists, 10-12 screws per panel should be sufficient for their added body weight.

HIIT workouts are usually a little shorter in length — maybe 20–30 minutes — and alternate between very high intensity exercise and more moderate intensity exercise.On a treadmill, you can alternate between sprinting and jogging or between jogging and running on an incline. You want your heart rate to be significantly higher during the higher intensity bouts during a HIIT workout.
HIIT workouts have been shown to burn more calories from fat and can help your body continue to burn more calories after you've completed your workout.;
, If you typically just hit the treadmill and run at the same incline and same pace each day your treadmill routine can get a little boring. Try some of the other features on the treadmill, like increasing the incline, to make your treadmill workout a little more exciting.


You can run your whole routine on an incline or you can alternate between running at a flat level and then running on an incline. Since the incline is a little more difficult, you may need to slow down your pace a touch.
The incline is something you can do to spice up your routine, but using this feature can also produces some extra health benefits. Running on an incline helps burn more calories, can help prevent shin splints and can help increase speed and endurance., If you find yourself zoning out on the treadmill or getting a little bored with your run, try making treadmill games for yourself. You can make these games something you do on a regular basis or save them for times when you need a little change.


One game you can design for yourself is treadmill cards. Take four index cards and write on the front of each one. Write one of these words on each card: sprint, incline, side gallop (described in a later step) or jog. Pick cards at random every three or five minutes. You'll never know what's coming next.
You can also play ""trigger word"" if you are watching TV while working out. Pick a word and assign that as your trigger word. Every time you hear that word sprint for one minute or run on an incline for three minutes.

, If traditional running on the treadmill has got you a little burnt out, try other cardio moves instead. These new moves help challenge your body in new ways and train different sets of muscles.Do side gallops. Slow the treadmill down a bit. Face your body and feet sideways and rest your hands lightly on the handle bars — your right foot should be closest to the front of the treadmill. Step your right foot towards the front of the treadmill. Hop the left foot over to meet your right foot. Continue in this pattern for as long as you can and then switch sides.
You can also squat down a little bit in between hops to work out your thighs and glutes a little bit harder.
Incorporate high knees. Again, slow down the treadmill a bit to do high knees. Alternating sides, bring your knees up to your chest. Do this quickly so your heart rate stays elevated.

, It's generally recommended to not only do cardio, but also participate in some strength training for a complete workout. Ditch the weight room and bring your weights with you on the treadmill.


There are a variety of strength training exercise you can do on the treadmill while you're walking. This can cut down on the amount of time you spend working out each day.Grab a pair of small to medium dumbbells (or a size that's appropriate for your fitness level). You can try: doing bicep curls, shoulder presses, lateral raises, and front raises.You can also try doing some leg strengthening exercises. At a slow pace, do walking lunges on the treadmill. This can help strengthen your thighs and glutes.
Make sure you're walking at a safe pace that you can lift weights, but maintain your balance as well. If you're going too fast or are not paying attention, you could trip.
Be cautious of your joints. Elbows and shoulders can be injured by carrying dumbbells for longer than you are used to. Count reps for each exercise and then put the dumbbells down to rest the arm and shoulder muscles before proceeding to the next exercise.

, Many, many runners and other exercisers choose to listen to music during their workouts. Not only is it fun and motivating, there's some research to support the fact that listening to music can actually benefit your workout routine.If you sync your running pace with some music, you may actually notice improved endurance. Many studies show that when a runner syncs her pace with certain types of music, she can run longer and use less oxygen.Also, choosing a song whose beat is just a touch faster than your pace can help keep you motivated and even make you run a little faster. This is a good idea to try if you're looking to improve your pace.Some music apps will monitor your running pace and match your pace with the beats of songs. This can help keep you going as your feet match the songs you're listening to.

, In addition to music, there are other things you can do while you're running on the treadmill. Many of these things help distract you mentally and can keep you running a little bit longer.


Download an audiobook. Audiobooks are a great thing to have on hand. They keep your attention as you follow a story line or plot and are great for longer runs.
Watch a good movie or TV show. Plan your treadmill runs around your favorite TV show or sitcom. This can help you focus completely on the TV and not on your running.
Read a book or magazine. If you're able to, try reading a book, newspaper or magazine while you're running. You can get distracted by pictures and story lines while you run.

, The one thing about a treadmill run that can double as a ""pro"" and a ""con"" is the fact that you can see your progress on the screen or panel in front of you. Although you'll know exactly how fast you're running, it may drive you nuts during longer runs.If you have to put in a decent amount of miles on your treadmill, watching that clock slowly go up in mileage can be difficult. This is especially true if you're not focused or having a tough time distracting yourself mentally.
If you find yourself staring at the mileage clock or looking down at that panel every minute (even though it felt like 10 minutes), cover up the panel completely. Use your gym towel, shirt or a piece of paper to completely block the screen.
You may be less tempted to look at the panel and be forced to get yourself mentally focused on something else besides how far you've run.

, Running on a treadmill can be difficult mentally. Some days the TV, your playlist or the other people around you aren't enough to distract your mind. When this happens, try focusing by doing a little meditation while you run.Come up with a mantra. A mantra is a short saying that is meaningful and motivating to you. If you can't get your mind off the treadmill, try repeating a personal mantra to yourself. It could be ""just keep running, just keep running, just keep running"" or ""keep going, you got this.""
Focus on your breathing. Think about your breath. Are you breathing hard? Are your breaths short or are you breathing deeply? Try to concentrate on your breath-breathing in, breathing out, breathing in and breathing out.
You may also want to try to coordinate your breaths with your stride. For example, breath in every two strides and then breath out for two strides. This forced method of breathing may help slow down your heart rate which can help you last longer on the treadmill., To stay motivated and excited with any type of workout, try setting goals for yourself. This can help give you the encouragement to power through times of boredom with your exercise routine.


Your goals should be specific, timely and realistic. This will help make sure your goals are something that you'll actually meet.If you typically are exercising on a treadmill, make some goals related to running or your treadmill workouts. You can work towards being able to run longer distances, run at a faster pace or at a higher incline.
You might also want to consider making one longer-term goal and then have smaller, mini goals along the way to meeting that bigger goal., Another good way to keep yourself motivated and on track with your goals is by working out with a friend. It's fun and has been shown to be one of the best ways to stick to your workout routine.Many studies have shown that if you workout with a friend or a family member you're less likely to skip workouts or deviate from your goals.Your workout buddy provides a gentle coercion, can keep you feeling and thinking positively and may help you meet the goals you've set for yourself.Talk to your friends, family members or co-workers about working out together. Try to get someone to meet you at the gym, show up for an afternoon walk or take a walk break over lunch.

, There's nothing more exciting than seeing yourself make progress with your goals. Write down your goals on paper and track your progress to help yourself stay excited and motivated with your workouts.


After you've thought about your goals and come up with some ideas, write them down in an exercise journal or planner. Getting them on paper can make them more real for you.You can also download a fitness app onto your smartphone and use that to track your progress.
Track your daily progress towards your goal. Write down what days you're working out, for how long and how your workout went that day.
In addition to your goals, note little milestones as well. For example, note the first time you were able to run three miles without a walk break.

, Changing up your exercise routine is a great way to spice up your exercise plan and keep you focused and motivated. In addition, a change in exercise type can come with many other benefits.


Hitting the treadmill day after day can get old and boring. If you're feeling a little burnt out from the treadmill, try other cardio machines or try running outside.Even a few days or a week or two of something different may be enough.
In addition to preventing boredom, changing up your exercise routine helps improve your overall fitness level. Every time you do something new, you're continuing to challenge your body in a different way. This helps your body to continue to build endurance and strength., Another fun way to keep yourself motivated and working toward meeting your goals is by setting up some rewards for yourself. Even small treats can help keep you excited to continue working towards your goals.One way to get a very simple reward is by taking a few moments right after finishing a workout to savor how good you feel. Maybe you focus on your increased energy, happy feelings, proud feelings or how healthy you feel.
If you have one big, long-term goal, consider setting yourself up a bigger reward. Maybe you run 10 miles every week for a month or finally run five miles without stopping on the treadmill. Reward yourself with a new running outfit, new running shoes or a new set of running headphones.
If you're also trying to lose weight or maintain your weight, food related rewards may not be a good idea as this could sidetrack you from a weight goal."

Identify manageable goals.,

Repeat for 10 minutes a day every day.,
Buy a weighted hula hoop.,
Experiment with different stances.,
Try walking while hula hooping.,
Sign up for a hula hoop class at your local gym.",How to Hula Hoop to Lose Weight," While hula hooping is a great way to get some extra aerobic activity and tone your muscles, it can’t replace all other aerobic activities or compensate for inadequate strength training. Use hula hooping instead as a way to spice up your workout regimen, or to target some “problem areas” you’ve been wanting to tone. For example, hula hooping can effectively tone ab muscles and slim your waistline, or it can tone and strengthen thigh and hip areas.


A 30-minute session of hula hooping can burn 165 calories for a woman and 200 calories for a man.;
, You might be tempted to grab your child’s hula hoop out of the garage or resurrect your own childhood hoop, but chances are these toys won’t work for your purposes. Find one that, when placed in front of you, stands from the floor to your navel. The wider the hoop, the easier it will be to swing and get going.


Also remember to take your waist-size into consideration. If you’ve got a wider waist, you’ll need a hoop with a wider circumference., Hula hooping requires minimal supplies and investment, but no matter what you’ll need a space—indoors or out—where you can swing your hoop without obstruction. Look for a spacious room or a corner of your yard where there are no trees, pillars, or furniture which could snag your hoop and impede movement.If storage space is an issue, you can find a retractable or inflatable hoop that will take up less space in your house or yard.
The bigger the space you find, the more opportunity you’ll have to expand your hula routine and make it into a more advanced workout which integrates other exercises such as lunges, walking, or crunches.

, Standing in the open area, step through your hula hoop and place the hoop flush to your back, slightly above your hips. As you stand with your feet side to side or with one foot slightly in front of the other, you can adjust the hoop’s height on your waist to the place where it feels most comfortable or natural.Your feet should be about 15 – 20 inches (about 38 – 50 centimeters) apart.

, As you become more advanced, you’ll be able to hula hoop in any direction you please, but for now you should swing in the direction that feels most comfortable. Usually, right-handed people find that they prefer to swing in a counterclockwise direction, while left-handers go clockwise, but ultimately it’s a matter of personal taste.Be sure that you’re not pushing down or up at the same time as you’re pushing to the side. Any vertical slant to your hoop’s swing will make it more difficult to swing and maintain height., Once your hoop is in motion, rock your weight gently from one foot to the other while bending your knees slightly. This leg movement is actually what keeps your hoop in motion. So, rather than thinking of hooping as a circular, hip-generated movement, think of it as a lateral, pumping motion.While concentrating on your legs and hips, be sure to hold your arms above your head or at least at shoulder-level. Swinging your arms or dropping them will affect your balance and impede your hula hooping.

, As you’re hooping, be mindful of your posture and muscular activity. Your spine should be straight as you maintain the hoop’s motion, and your core should be firm rather than relaxed. This will tone your stomach and back, as well as improve your posture in everyday life.Some hooping enthusiasts recommend practicing yoga or dance as a way to improve hooping skills, posture, and relevant muscle groups.

, Advanced hula hoopers can work out with their hoops for hours on end, but you’ll need to build your stamina and skill as a beginner in order to get to this level. Do so by using your hula hoop for 10 minutes a day, every day, for a week or two.Once your stamina improves, you should strive to hoop for thirty minutes at a time.

, While any hula hoop will get you up and moving, weighted hula hoops can be particularly useful additions to your workout regimen. They’re bigger and heavier than the garden variety hoop, meaning that they provide greater resistance and make your workout more vigorous.You can find weighted hoops at most sporting goods stores, or you can check out options online through mass retailers like Amazon and eBay.

, Once you’ve gotten comfortable with a particular stance as you hula hoop, try switching up your foot position to work different muscle groups. In the forward stance, for example, you stand with one foot in front of the other. In the side stance, you plant your feet at shoulder-width or slightly wider.


You’ll find that your abs and legs are put under different stress as you hoop in different stances. Focus on keeping your abs tight and your chest and head lifted in order to maintain good posture and get the most out of your workout., Hula hooping is already aerobic exercise as long as you do it continuously, but walking while hooping will burn even more calories. Once you can easily switch between different stances and hoop continuously for 10 – 20 minutes at a time, you can try it out. Start in forward stance and then take a mini-step forward. Keep your posture erect and stay mindful of your head, neck, chest, and ab position.If this exercise gets too easy, try walking in different directions! To walk to the side, start in side stance and begin inching to the side until you feel comfortable taking larger strides.

, Hula hooping is an easy exercise to do solo, but you can also take a class in order to learn new workouts and fancy tricks. Your instructor can give you pointers on posture, as well as show you how to target specific areas on your body that you’ve been wanting to tone.


If your local gym doesn’t offer hooping classes, try searching online for hoop gatherings or one-on-one freelance instructors in your area."

Breathe through your nose.,
Take deep breaths.,
Exhale properly.",How to Improve Your Breathing1," Although most of us are able to breathe through our mouths, you should always favor breathing in through your nose. Your nose is specifically designed for the intake of air and will help filter out particles and dust.Your nose has thin hairs and mucous that will help keep the air entering your lungs clean.
Breathing in through your mouth may cause your mouth and throat to dry out.
Your nose produces a gas called nitric oxide that enhances your immune systemand may even increase the oxygenation of your blood.;
, Either due to bad breathing habits or from being under stress, many people take quick and shallow breaths. Breathing provides vital oxygen to the body, and these short breaths don't carry as much oxygen as deeper and slower breathing will.Inhale through your nose.
Imagine you are filling your belly up with air. At the start of the breath, your stomach should rise first, before your chest.
When your stomach is “full” continue the inhalation, allowing the chest to rise now.
Take your time breathing in. A good breath should last around five seconds on the inhalation.

, Just as with inhaling, exhalations of the breath should be done slowly. Exhaling too quickly lessens the time that our lungs can intake oxygen and remove carbon dioxide.

Exhale through your mouth. You can try pursing your lips to slow the exhalation.Let the lungs push the air out at their own pace. Try not to force air out of your lungs.
Start the exhalation at the stomach level, letting your diaphragm relax first. Your chest should fall with or after your stomach does.
Don't rush the exhalation. Just like with the inhalation, you should take a few seconds to exhale.

Keep a good rhythm when running.,
Breathe correctly when strength training.,
Use your natural breath during stretching.,
Exercise to improve breathing.",How to Improve Your Breathing2," If you are a jogger, you can improve your runs by employing better breathing techniques. The main technique involves breathing in a certain rhythm and deeply inhaling and exhaling.

Try to keep your breathing ratio around 3:2, in relation to your steps. For three steps, inhale deeply. For the next two steps, exhale as fully as you can.
You may need to change the ratio as you increase the intensity of your run. Always keep the inhalation longer than the exhalation as you make your adjustments.
Shorter breaths mean less oxygen and greater amounts of carbon dioxide in your body. This results in your heart working harder than it has to and a decrease in athletic performance.

, Weight lifting or body weight exercises can be a great way to build strength and add muscle. Breathing properly during these activities can increase the amount of exercise you are able to do. Remember the following tips during your strength training routines:

When you are exerting yourself, exhale. For example, when lifting a weight, let yourself exhale fully.
Inhale when relaxing the movement. For instance, when lowering the weight back down, take a deep breath.
Your breathing should correspond to the lifting and lowering of whatever weight you are lifting.
Properly breathing during strength training prevents injury and increases performance.

, Breathing during your stretching sessions, after or before a workout, most closely resembles the way in which you normally breathe. Relaxed and full inhalations and exhalations are the key.Inhale through your nose. Your nose is specially designed to filter incoming air.
Some experts believe that it's best to exhale through your nose as well.
Get a deeper breath by inhaling with your diaphragm as opposed to your chest.
Never force your breath, either on the inhalation or exhalation.
Try getting a deeper stretch as you exhale, relaxing into the motion.

, By getting proper exercise you will increase the quality and efficiency of your breathing. The main cause of this is that by improving the health and strength of your muscles, they will function better, requiring less oxygen.If you are new to exercise, or have a condition such as COPD, try starting out with light workouts. Aim for increasing the length of time that you exercise rather than increasing the intensity of exercise.

Monitor moisture levels in your house.,
Make sure your house is properly ventilated.,
Avoid smoking.,
Get some house plants.",How to Improve Your Breathing3," Too much moisture or high humidity can promote the growth of molds and mildew. Mold and mildew can be harmful to the respiratory system and may cause respiratory problems. Devices to measure humidity are widely available at any home improvement or household stores.
Purchase and use a dehumidifier if your humidity levels are too high. Remember to regularly empty the water it collects from your house.

, Stagnant air can be harmful to breathe as it may have accumulated allergens, microbes, or other irritants. Create airflow in your house to let fresh air enter your space and allow stale air an exit.Opening a few windows is the easiest way to create airflow in your house.
You may also try to place a fan, either pulling air in or pushing air out, to help increase airflow.
HVAC systems may be installed in your home to greatly improve air quality.

, Smoking indoors will immediately introduce harmful chemicals into the air. These won't simply vanish with the smoke but will instead cling to many surfaces in the room. If you must smoke, do it outside.Smoking anywhere will harm your lungs and make breathing less efficient.
Incense or other scented combustibles also release smoke and reduce the air quality in your home.

, House plants are a great and easy way to improve the quality of air in your house. Plants absorb many chemicals in the air that humans cannot breath, such as carbon dioxide, and release oxygen that we need. Some plants are more efficient at this than others, review the list and pick your favorites:Aloe vera.
Spider plants.

Increase your fiber intake.,
Choose lean proteins.,
Start meals with soup.,

Battle bloating.,
Drink more water.",How to Get a Flat Stomach in a Month," If you want a flatter stomach, you need to reduce your body fat, and you do that by burning more calories than you consume. Reducing your calorie intake will cause your body to turn to its internal fuel reserve — the fat you are seeking to eliminate.In basic terms, one pound of fat equals roughly 3,500 calories. This means, generally speaking, that you need to burn 500 more calories per day than you consume in order to lose a pound a week, which is considered a healthy weight reduction rate.
When you’re trying to reduce your calorie intake, it’s important to make each calorie count by choosing low-calorie, high-nutrition foods like vegetables, fruits, and lean proteins. The tables available through the Mayo Clinic provide examples of how making some relatively simple food “swaps” and portion alterations can help significantly reduce your calorie intake.;
, Fruits, vegetables, beans and legumes, and whole grains not only offer an array of nutrients, they are also high-fiber foods that can help your weight-loss regimen in several ways. The recommended daily intake for fiber depends on your age and sex; refer to this table to figure out how much fiber you need.


Some people associate fiber with bloating and therefore advise against it when seeking a flatter tummy. In reality, though, fiber helps flush out your system, which can help reduce a bloated appearance.
Fiber does, however, provide a more lasting feeling of fullness, which can help you reduce your daily calorie intake.

, Lean proteins like fish, poultry, and low-fat dairy products offer beneficial nutrients without excess calories or unhealthy fats. They can also help supply you with the energy you’ll need to keep up an active exercise regimen, which is also an important component of achieving a flat stomach.Packed with protein and low in carbohydrates and overall calories, eggs can make an excellent breakfast option to help jump-start your day.
There is also evidence that dairy proteins help increase satiety (your feeling of fullness), which may help you to eat less during the day. Look for low-fat options., Achieving a healthier diet is all about feeling satisfied with fewer calories and without sacrificing beneficial nutrients. It turns out that something as simple as soup can be of great help.


A study conducted at Penn State University indicates that consuming a bowl of low-calorie soup before lunch or dinner reduces overall calorie intake at that meal by some 20%. Basically, it helps fill you up before you even get to the main part of your meal.For the best nutritional benefits, choose a soup that is low in calories, fat, and sodium, and high in vegetables, lean protein, and fiber. Make sure to check labels if you are using prepared soup.

, Be skeptical any time you read or hear that ""this"" smoothie or ""that"" kind of protein targets and helps eliminate belly fat. No food (or exercise, for that matter) can target fat in a specific area of the body; you either reduce your overall amount of body fat everywhere or nowhere.That said, there are foods that can help your stomach appear slimmer by dealing with bloating or a slow digestive system, such as those containing fiber or probiotics, or those lower in sodium.

, Think of your body’s layer of fat covering your stomach (and elsewhere) as a “jacket” (one of its purposes, after all, is to hold in body heat). Your exercise goal is to shed that jacket.Think of it this way — if you were wearing a light jacket, would the type of exercise you are doing make you want to take it off? You want to choose aerobic exercises that warm your body enough that you’d want to shed a real jacket — brisk walking, cycling, dancing, swimming, and so on. Cardiovascular exercises of this sort can burn enough calories to require your body to draw energy from (and thus “shed”) your “fat jacket.”
It should be noted, however, that you do not want to perform only cardio exercises and neglect building muscles and strength. Cardio burns more fat during the exercise, but muscle burns fat while you are at rest — building muscle, therefore, will ultimately help you burn more fat. You need both types of exercise for bone health and metabolism.

, For fat reduction and weight loss, your goal should be to average thirty to sixty minutes of aerobic exercise daily. The exercise doesn’t need to be intense, but should make you breathe hard enough to make having a conversation a bit of a challenge, and work up at least a light sweat (think again of the jacket analogy from above).Cardiovascular exercises get the heart pumping and are great for burning visceral fat.Some people prefer the discipline and routine of taking the same jog around the neighborhood each morning, but for many of us, variety helps make aerobic exercise more appealing. Even activities like housecleaning or yardwork can count if you keep up a brisk pace. You may want to keep a daily activity log to track your daily aerobic exercise.

, While it's true you'll need to lose the fat over your abdominals so that your muscle tone can show through, don't rely on cardio alone to get the job done. Muscle will help reshape your body and allow you to actually burn calories while your body is at rest, not just when you're hitting the gym. Studies show that those who lift weights have a lower fat mass percentage than those who do aerobic exercise alone.While simple sit-ups and crunches are an option, there are seemingly endless ab-toning exercises out there, with names like the “hip dip plank” and the “inner thigh crunch lift.” Employing a variety of core-strengthening exercises is more likely to provide overall toning, but remember that aerobic exercise should be your priority., Ideally, instead of focusing on muscle-toning exercises that target only your abdominals, you should seek out alternatives that utilize other muscle groups as well. They often require more exertion, which can help with fat burning. Also, additional muscle tone in the back, chest, shoulders, legs, etc. can improve posture and otherwise help make your belly appear slimmer.


For instance, you can try:The ""pike and extend."" Lie on your back with your arms and legs extended upward. Crunch your abs and try to touch your toes with your hands. Drop both hands and one leg down so they are parallel to the floor (and your body). Repeat the move while alternating legs.
The ""knee-up with overhead press."" Sit on the floor with your knees bent and feet on the ground. Hold dumbbells in each hand at shoulder height. Lean back slightly, extend your arms straight up overhead, and pull in your knees. Hold for a beat, return to the starting position, and repeat.



, Your mother was on to something when she hounded you about standing up straight. Standing and sitting with improved posture can noticeably reduce the appearance of a bulge in your belly, even before you factor in fat-reduction and muscle-toning strategies.


Most of us have attempted to “suck in our gut” at some point, but that is of course not sustainable. Proper posture, however, is sustainable. It can be learned and it can be made permanent.
Visit How to Stand Up Straight for some simple posture strategies and exercises.

, It turns out that you can place a little bit of the blame for your bulging belly on our caveman ancestors. Part of the “fight or flight” reflex that helped protect our predecessors from sabre-tooth tigers triggers a release of cortisol, which signals the body to store fat in the abdominal area — saving it as energy for tough times to come.One of the best ways to reduce cortisol levels, it turns out, is to reduce our overall stress (basically, reducing that ""fight or flight"" response). In turn, this should help reduce the amount of fat stored in the abdominal area.
Check out How to Relieve Stress for a wide range of strategies for recognizing, addressing, and reducing your stress levels.

, A lack of sufficient sleep also causes stress on the body, and results in increased cortisol levels, which again trigger fat storage. Getting the amount of sleep that is right for your body should help reduce your cortisol levels, and therefore in turn your fat storage mechanism.Most adults need somewhere between seven to nine hours of sleep per day, but everyone’s precise needs are different. How to Be a Morning Person offers some useful tips for determining how much sleep you need — and how to help make sure you get it.

, In addition to an excess of abdominal fat, bloating can be a major (if often temporary) culprit for causing a less-than-flat stomach. Making some changes in diet and habits can help reduce your experiences of bloating.Excess salt intake is a common cause of bloating, because it facilitates water retention in the body. Skipping the salt shaker is a good idea, but the vast majority of most people’s sodium intake comes from prepared and packaged foods. Read labels and menu boards for sodium content, and work to remain at or below recommended daily levels.
Carbonated drinks not only tend to provide empty calories with no nutritional value, the carbonation itself can cause bloating — just another reason to skip the soda.
Bloating can sometimes be caused by digestive issues, and dairy products containing probiotics can help some people address this problem. Look for products like yogurt and kefir that contain “live and active cultures.”
Consider that constipation can cause bloating and the feeling of a fat tummy. Exercise is one way to help relieve constipation.

, Despite what some people assume, drinking lots of water does not cause “water-weight gain.” Rather, drinking water helps flush out the system and limit bloating.The traditional advice has typically been that an adult should drink eight, 8-ounce glasses (two litres) of water per day. Drink before you feel thirsty and keep it up throughout the day.
Drinking a glass of water before a meal can also help fill you up faster, thereby reducing your calorie intake.

Look out for red flags.",How to Choose a Personal Trainer," Knowing what you need and want to accomplish will prepare you for choosing the right personal trainer. Some trainers will be well-suited to your needs, whereas others may seem lacking in the experience needed to help you. Consider your goals: many people start by saying they want to lose a certain amount of weight. Others aim for running in a marathon. And for others the goal can be simply to regain strength and health after an injury.


Keep nutrition in mind when considering your goals. You may want to alter your diet as you get more physically fit.
Some common fitness goals include improving your balance and flexibility, improving your immune system, or even just getting out of your comfort zone.
Make these goals as specific as possible. So not just, “I want to get stronger abs,” but “I want to be able to do 50 regular and 50 inverted sit-ups in one go by the end of next month.”;
, Before you commit to a workout routine (let alone a trainer), it is helpful to see how the physical activities your already enjoy could be a part of your training. That way you can avoid potential boredom and have fun at the same time you're getting healthy. Is straightforward weight lifting all that you're looking for? Maybe you want to improve your cardiovascular health but find most fitness routines boring. In that case you may want to find a trainer who does dance aerobics.


Consider what sports you have played during your lifetime. Maybe you want to do workouts that incorporate aspects of these sports.
Once you start interviewing trainers, share this information and see if the trainer connects with it too.

, There are many benefits of working alone with a trainer. Solo classes give your trainer more time to focus on your specific needs. He can also spend more time observing you, tracking progress, checking your vitals and improvements in health. You'll be the center of attention every time you meet. For some people this is ideal, but for others it may be a drawback.


With one-one-one training it's even more important that you are socially comfortable with your trainer.

, Some personal trainers lead multiple clients at a time. Since there are more people working out together, you have more opportunity for a fun and social time. This can counter the boredom that many people claim they feel around working out. Classmates can also help keep you motivated and hold you accountable for doing exercises completely, correctly, and pushing yourself further.Many group classes are designed to be more engaging. Aerobics, choreographed dance, pilates, indoor cycling, kickboxing, muscle conditioning, and fall prevention are all examples of group classes with a range of style and experience.

, Some people are not as interested in becoming an athlete, training for competitions, or anything that intense. For many it's just about dropping pounds, which is as good a reason as any to train. A weight loss clinic is a facility where you can consult with doctors and create a personalized weight loss plan. Medical professionals will then help you stick with your weight loss plan through weekly meetings at the clinic and check ins.You may want to call around to several different weight loss clinics in your area to find the right one for you. You can also ask the clinic about the quality of their fitness coaches and read reviews online for the weight loss clinic.

, Working with a trainer in person could be the wrong fit for several reasons. Maybe you can't afford it, you don't want to commute to train, or you simply aren't comfortable with anyone you've met. It's also possible to use videos and video games as a replacement for a personal trainer.


Many people have posted training videos on YouTube that can be accessed for free.
Some professional trainers and athletes have their own video series devoted to different workouts routines.
Nintendo has motion-sensor based video games that lead you through workout routines. These have become popular with kids and adults alike.
Be advised that any videos you find online may not be done by an accredited trainer. And so you cannot guarantee they are showing proper form or that they are as knowledgeable about health and injury. They also can't see you, so they can't check to make sure you are using correct form.

, Are there programs you've heard of and want to give a shot? CrossFit, Pilates, YogaFit, and kettle bells are a few skills that different trainers specialize in.


You may then want to look into trainers who offer the types of training you are interested in. Search for a trainer who is a pro in CrossFit or a master yogi. Seek out a trainer who integrates kettle bells into her training programs. Often, the more specialized a trainer is, the more skilled she is at a specific workout or training style.

, It's not necessary to throw your entire budget into havoc just to afford a trainer you're sold on. Even if you find a trainer who is a good fit, if he charges more than you can afford, you might need to make another choice. Make a budget and decide based on your income and expenses how much you're able to spend each month on physical training.


Personal trainer rates can range from $60–$70 an hour to as low as $25 an hour. Trainer rates are usually lower in small towns and cities. But there is usually not a big price difference between a trainer you go to at a gym and a trainer who comes to your house to train you., Word of mouth, whether from friends or acquaintances can be a solid source of information. Talk to people whose physique and health you admire and want to achieve. See who they work with and look into that trainer. Oftentimes talking to people who already have experience with a trainer is the most helpful way to make a smart choice.Keep in mind that not everyone likes the same kind of training. If you and the people you talk to have very different needs, goals, and respond to different kinds of motivation, their recommendation might not be helpful to you.

, Joining a gym has the benefit of giving you access to a range of workout equipment. Some gyms also have technology for testing clients' physical health. Whether you are already a gym member, or still just considering your options, it's possible to visit different gyms in your area to learn about their trainers. Ask the people in charge for background info, credentials, and skill sets of each trainer.


Usually gyms offer personal training as an add on cost. You can sign up for personal training and pay another fee on top of the monthly fee you pay for general use of the equipment and the space. They may also have contracts with trainers so they can only offer their services at that gym.Before signing up, try to find out how the trainers are paid and whether they work on commission sales. Sometimes commercial gyms hire personal trainers as sales people. Although they are well-meaning, these people can be more driven to sell you memberships and services, than they are to help you with your fitness goals.

, The NSCA, ACSM, IDEA, and ACE all have search tools to locate credentialed personal trainers based on area code. Using these databases can give you a strong list of people to check out. And furthermore it can guarantee anyone you find will have the necessary skills and training to help you.


It's possible to have trainers come to your home. This is convenient and may appeal to you. However if you go this option, make sure you run a background check on the trainer for your own safety., If you are at a gym, pay attention to the trainers who are working with their clients. If they work in their own gyms, move from place to place as a consultant, or work outside of a gym, ask if you can come observe them work with a client. You'll interview them yourself later, but first you can gain valuable knowledge by watching them work with other clients.


Staring in a gym is rude, but if you are using a machine near a trainer and client you can hear how they interact and get an idea of how knowledgeable the trainer is.
Do the clients seem to enjoy being around her? Are her clients trying hard and do they seem motivated?
Different people look for different qualities in trainers. While some people enjoy the intensity of a drill-sergeant, others need a more light-hearted and supportive approach.

, See who you gel with and pay attention to your comfort level. Personality matters. No matter how good a trainer is, if you don't get along with him, you won't be happy. Some people want someone to scream at them, but others are intimidated by forceful trainers.


Don't engage him as a potential client. If he asks, you can say you're just working out on your own for now before making a decision. Have casual conversation and trust your emotional instincts.
Test his sense of humor. Tell jokes that reveal a little about who you are and what your perspectives are. His reaction will help you judge how you two may understand each other and get along.

, Once you've found a few people who interest you, based in your observations and conversations, interview them one-by-one. Although you are the client, you're the one who is actually employing the trainer. So it is perfectly normal to ask any questions you have before making a commitment.


A good trainer will listen to you, find out what your goals are, and help you reach those goals.

, The National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) and the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) are considered the most rigorous and respected programs for athletic trainers in the US.The National Academy Sports Medicine (NASM) and the American Council on Exercise (ACE) are the other two most reputable establishments.Any personal trainer who is certified by one of these establishments will have the skills and training necessary to help you with your fitness goals.


Take a look at this chart for a comparison of the three accrediting agencies.
Other countries, like Canada, have different governing bodies in each province, and many disciplines (yoga, martial arts, sports associations, pilates, etc.) certify various types of trainers and coaches in various disciplines. Trainers pay fees and must take ongoing training to maintain accreditations with these governing bodies.

, It's important to know how long the person has been working as a personal trainer, as well as what kind of physical fitness he has been involved with beforehand. You might not want to work with someone who is new to working professionally. Or maybe you enjoy the vitality of a younger, albeit less experienced, trainer. That decision is up to you.


Ask about his work experience, but also ask about any sports, competitions, performances, dance, and other physical activities he has spent his time on throughout his life.

, Find out how she plans on motivating you to accomplish your goals. Once you've shared your goals, ask what kind of routines she envisions to help you succeed. Also find out how she plans on tracking your progress.


Trainers can show you weekly routines she will lead you through to accomplish your goals. She will break down the hours trained and how all your time is divided between various workouts.
Stay realistic about your goals. For example if you tell a trainer that you want to lose 50 pounds in a week, and she says that's unhealthy and pretty unreasonable, don't be upset. People who promise you the impossible or don't point out reality may not be trustworthy.
Ask about any specific routines or programs you are interested in (CrossFit, YogaFit, etc.).

, Injuries happen with training. Ask how he plans on preventing and working with any injuries you have or may get later on. Also, he will need to know your health conditions so he can avoid harmful activities.


If you have major injuries and are working on overcoming them, you may want to find someone who has experience with physical therapy. Ask if the trainer has any experience with physical therapy or rehabilitation.

, If you found a trainer through a gym or search database, get some direct opinions and information from her former or current clients. People who have worked directly with a trainer can offer insightful details about the trainer's personality, abilities, ups, and downs.


When contacting strangers, be polite and grateful for the help they're offering you by giving their time.

, Whether you like a potential trainer or not can become less significant depending on his availability. Have your own weekly/monthly calendar ready to compare with each trainer's open time slots. Look for someone who is free at times that accommodate your lifestyle.


It's possible that you like and believe in a trainer enough to change your own schedule. Be sure to weigh your other responsibilities and desires before going through with that kind of adjustment.

, Observation, conversation, and interview can tell you a lot. However, nothing will give you a better idea of which trainer is right for you than actually working out with her. If your gym/athletic club offers free monthly trainings, take advantage of this opportunity. Use the free monthly session to get acquainted with the different trainers in the gym.

, You don't have to sign up for training sessions with the trainer who gives you your initial tour of the gym. Trainers often show a lot of enthusiasm in conversation and may try to persuade you to be their client. Don't let anyone talk you into making immediate decisions. Instead, take the time to observe and interact with all the possible trainers. This way you'll feel more confident with your final choice.


If a trainer pushes you to sign you up soon, just politely decline his offer. Let him know you want to see what everyone has to offer before starting a trainer-client relationship.

, The average range for personal trainers in the U.S. is $18/hr and can range anywhere from $9 to $48.59/hr.If anyone tells you he charges more than this, you are possibly getting taken advantage of and should move on. If he charges in the higher end of this range, look for experience, credentials, and a personality to justify it.


In Canada you can expect to pay anywhere from $25 to $120 or $150 per hour or per session (confirm this with your trainer). The average is around $40-50.
If you are meeting your trainer far from his ""base,"" will you be paying his travel time? Trainers are often willing to meet in parks and other public spaces, but make sure you know if this will be an additional cost.

, Often times you can save money by buying multiple sessions at once. It's also possible to save money by joining in-group sessions. For either case, ask whether there is an expiration date on your purchased sessions. Also inquire about their cancellation and refund policy.


It's also common for trainers to include physical assessments in their deals. This could be testing for blood pressure, body fat, endurance, flexibility, and strength.
Most trainers have a 24 hour minimum cancellation policy. If you miss a session and give less than 24 hours notice, you may still have to pay.

, There are trainers out there who are unqualified to teach or take advantage of their situation to profit from clients' inexperience. Don't buy into trainers who try to sell you workout supplements. Oftentimes they earn a commission, and for most people (who don't want to be body builders), there is no need for more than a balanced diet and proper exercise. Also look out for trainers who give excessive advice about your diet. It's okay to come up with a new diet together, but personal trainers are not certified to offer dietary advice, even if they go by “nutritionists”. Only Registered Dieticians can legally make a meal plan for you.Your trainer may have nutrition certifications which allows her to provide some advice about diet including macro nutrient balance (fats, carbohydrates, protein), calorie guidelines, good eating habits and hydration. Most trainers know a great deal about nutrition but should keep within their scope of practice, which will depend on their certifications.
Impatience is a critical attribute to avoid. Trainers need to work with each individual client's needs and capacities. Their job is to motivate you, not to push you out of frustration with your pace.
Professionalism is necessary. Even with trainers with whom you talk with informally and feel comfortable around are there in a professional capacity. And as such they should show care and service to you like any other professional.

When you leave the hospital from your angioplasty your physician will talk with you and give you discharge papers that will explain exactly what type of physical activity you can and cannot do.
Be sure you understand the physician’s explanation and read over these instructions thoroughly. Make sure to discuss any questions or concerns with your doctor.
Also ask when your physician will give you a written or verbal clearance for activity. Get a general idea in your head of when that will be.
Once a clearance is given, you're generally allowed to proceed with most types of aerobic and resistance training.;
, Although an angioplasty is not a major cardiac procedure, it still often requires an overnight stay in the hospital and a period of rest afterwards.Although every physician is slightly different in their recommendations, most ask that you remain inactive for one to two days after your angioplasty.
This means no heavy lifting, no aerobic activity, or any activity that would require you to raise your heart rate significantly.
Normal, day-to-day activities are appropriate for the most part. Be careful with activities like carrying in heavy groceries, cleaning, gardening, etc. that would be of a higher intensity.

, After your few days of low activity, consider joining or starting with a cardiac rehab program. This should be something you discuss with your physician or cardiologist.


A cardiac rehab program is designed specifically for those patients that currently have or have had a history of cardiac events (like an angioplasty or heart attack).Cardiac rehab programs are best for patients that have had significant blockage, have had previous cardiac events (like a heart attack or angina) or are not currently in shape.
The purpose of these rehab programs is to educate you on how to exercise safely and work with you to build up your aerobic endurance over time.
There is a fitness professional and cardiologist that will supervise you and your heart as you exercise. In addition, most cardiac rehab programs are covered by your health insurance plan.

, If you're not going to choose to do a cardiac rehab program, you will be able to start activity by yourself. A great place to start is bumping up your lifestyle activity.


Lifestyle activities (or baseline activities) are those exercises that are a part of your normal daily routine. These are the activities that get you ""up and moving.""For example, taking the stairs, parking farther away, grocery shopping, gardening, etc are all activities that will get you up, moving and increase your heart rate.
When you first get home from your angioplasty, you'll probably be limited on your overall activity. Instead of starting with more structured exercise, slowly build endurance with these types of lifestyle activities.
Make it a point to take more steps, stand up more often or just move more in general. This will help build a baseline endurance and fitness level you can build off of in the future.

, A smart and safe option is to have a friend, co-worker or family member with you when you initially begin exercising.


In general, most patients are fine to exercise and will be fine while exercising after their angioplasty.
However, it might be smart to take someone with you. In case you feel lightheaded, dizzy or do have chest pains, they can assist you if needed.Also, don't go too far from your home or office. Stick around close if you need to get help, get to a phone or just need to get inside.

, Many health professionals recommend that healthy adults aim for 150 minutes of aerobic activity each week. As long as you're cleared by your physician, you should be aiming for this amount after your angioplasty as well.150 minutes is not a goal that you need to meet immediately. You may only be able to meet this goal after a few weeks or months in a cardiac rehab program.
It's recommended that you aim to do moderate-ntensity aerobic activity. This level has been shown to reduce hospital readmission and fewer long-term symptoms compared to those that didn't exercise at a moderate intensity.Try activities like walking, slow jogging, biking, swimming, hiking or dancing.

, After you've gotten comfortable with aerobic exercise, start thinking about including some weight training. This will complement your cardiovascular training.


Health professionals recommend that healthy adults, even those with cardiac problems, aim for two to three days of strength or resistance training. Do not weight train the same muscles two days in a row.
Aim to workout for about 20 minutes total in length. Include a series of exercises so that each major muscle group is worked.
Note that if you do have some chest pains or did previously, overhead exercises (like shoulder presses) may make you have some chest pains or feelings of tightness. Avoid these if they are bothersome or produce symptoms., Although most exercises in general will be safe for you after your angioplasty, some physicians recommend staying indoors when there is more extreme weather.


Some weather conditions, like overly hot, humid or very cold days can produce symptoms like chest pain, difficulty breathing or chest tightness.It's recommended to workout or exercise indoors if the temperature is below 20°F (-6°C).
Also stay indoors if the humidity is above 75% or the temperature in general is above 80°F (26.6°C).
Keep an eye on the weather. Note which days have very hot or cold temperatures and make plans to be safe and stay indoors instead.

, Usually, an angioplasty will help relieve cardiac-related symptoms (like chest pain); however, you still need to be mindful of how you're feeling during and after activity.Stop exercising and call your doctor if you experience:


Chest pain
Chest tightness
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
Wheezing
Dizziness or light-headedness
Heart palpitations
Discomfort in your jaw, arm, shoulder, back or stomach
Nausea

, After your angioplasty, it'll be recommended that you follow up with your doctor regularly. This is important to do and will help you continue to communicate with your physician about your progress.


If you want to advance your activity by increasing the intensity or time, call your doctor to discuss this.
If you're having difficulty making progress with exercise, call your physician and see if they have any recommendations for you.
Definitely check in with your cardiologist if you've experienced any side effects, symptoms or other issues.

, One essential type and part of your exercise routine is your warm-up and your cool-down. Include both after you've had an angioplasty.


Even though a warm-up and a cool-down aren't a specific type of exercise, they are a specific component to safe exercise after any type of cardiac procedure.A warm-up should be about five to 10 minutes long. Choose a very low intensity, low impact exercise that is a slowed-down version of the exercise you will be doing. For example, a slow walk on the treadmill before jogging.
The goal of the warm-up is to help your heart rate slowly increase and to get your muscles warm and loose and take them through their full range of motion.
A cool-down is very similar to a warm-up. It should also be about five to 10 minutes in length and be a low intensity, slower paced exercise. Again, walking would work.
The cool down allows your heart rate and blood pressure return to more normal levels without a quick drop in your activity.

, One very safe and frequently recommended exercise is a 30 minute walk. This is a great exercise for most angioplasty patients to start with.


Studies have shown that one of the best exercises to start with is walking. Aim for a 30 minute walk most days of the week.If you currently cannot walk for 30 minutes, this should be your first exercise-related goal.
Since walking is a low intensity and low impact exercise, you can do this most if not all days of the week.

, If you've got the 30 minute walk down and want to try other types of aerobic activity, try some of the following:


Jogging. While this might sound like an exercise that raises your heart rate too high, it is a type of cardio exercise that you can work towards over time. Jogging burns more calories than running and works your heart harder. This helps build better aerobic fitness.Swimming. This is another great cardio exercise. It involves your full body, but is easy on the joints and you can make it low intensity as needed. Plus, the water keeps your body cooler which keeps your heart rate lower.
Cycling. If jogging isn't your thing, try cycling. Like swimming, it's low impact and you can make the intensity lower if needed.

, Since strength training is a good type of exercise to include along with cardio, you need to find ways to include this. Yoga is a great low impact exercise that can help strengthen without raising your heart rate high.


Yoga is a great exercise to get into after any health issue, but especially after a cardiac procedure like an angioplasty.
The great thing about yoga is that it can be good for strength training, but also trains your breathing and can help relax and de-stress which might be useful after having a cardiac procedure like an angioplasty.
Try to take a yoga class one to two times a week. Aim for a 45 – 60 minute session. If you haven't done yoga before, take a beginners class so you can keep your heart rate lower.

Before starting to exercise, ask your doctor if regular physical activity is safe and appropriate for you. Although exercise can help improve angina in many patients, this isn't true for everyone.
Ask you doctor what types of exercise are best for you. Are you allowed to do cardiovascular exercise? Should those exercises be low intensity or can you do more moderate or high intensity exercises?
Ask you doctor about what signs and symptoms are dangerous. For example, if you experience chest pain while walking on the treadmill, what should your plan of action be?;
, Tracking your heart rate may be a beneficial practice when you're exercising with angina. It can give you an idea of how hard your heart is working.


Purchase a heart rate monitor for yourself. You can choose to get a wrist band or watch monitor, however it's best to purchase a chest strap monitor. These are the most accurate.When you first start an exercise program after being diagnosed with angina, it's typically recommended to do low intensity exercises that keep your heart rate at about 50% of your maximum heart rate.To find your maximum heart rate, subtract your age from 220. For example, if you're 60 years old, your maximum heart rate would be 160 beats per minute.
Using your heart rate tracker, keep you heart rate right at 50% during your exercise routine. In this example, you'd aim for your heart rate to be around 80 beats per minute.
If cleared by your doctor, you can slowly build up your aerobic endurance and increase to 60 or 70% of your maximum heart rate. However, don't aim to reach your max heart rate during exercise.
People with angina can adapt to exercise in a way that allows them to improve their exercise performance. Sometimes, you can take nitroglycerin to improve your exercise performance, but also, sometimes the exercise by itself helps you adapt.

, If you have been just diagnosed with angina, your doctor may suggest attending a regular cardiac rehab program. These are great medically supervised programs that can help you get back into regular exercise.


A cardiac rehab program is provided on an outpatient basis to those who have suffered from a cardiac event or have chronic cardiac conditions. They are designed to help improve fitness levels while reducing symptoms and side effects.Talk to your doctor about going to a cardiac rehab program to help improve your aerobic endurance, physical strength and range of motion.
Stick to your cardiac rehab program until you are cleared and released for exercise on your own. Follow up with your doctor regularly and stay on top of your cardiovascular health.

, Many people that have angina, are at lower fitness levels. This may especially be true if you've been required to take several weeks or months off from your exercise routine when you were initially diagnosed.


If you are trying to recover and rebuild your cardiac strength and endurance, it's recommended to start with short bouts of lower intensity exercises.Restarting with higher intensity exercises, or trying to go for a longer period of time could cause symptoms to reoccur or for your condition to get worse.
Aim to start with just 15-20 minutes of low intensity activity each day. If this feels too easy, increase the time to 25-30 minutes the next day, but do not increase the intensity.

,


As your endurance gets better and your fitness improves, you can very slowly increase first the length of your exercises and then the intensity as well.
Some of the best exercises that are low intensity are: walking, water walking, water aerobics, cycling or using the elliptical.
These exercises can increase your heart rate, but you are in full control of how high your heart rate increases during your exercise routine.

, Warm-ups and cool-downs have always been considered an important component of any exercise routine. However, both become even more essential to safe exercise.


Slowly easing into and out of an exercise routine helps slowly increase your heart rate, blood flow and warm up your muscles. Both can also help prevent injuries.
When you have angina, warming up and cooling down your heart is essential. If you don't, you can overwork your heart too quickly which could cause an onset of symptoms.Give your body and heart time to adjust to higher levels of activity. Start with a minimum of a 10 minute warm-up. Include very low intensity aerobic exercises and light stretching.
Also allow your heart to slowly cool down and your heart rate to slow as well. Your cool-down should also be 10 minutes of low intensity aerobic exercise followed by some light stretching.

, Another aspect to safe exercise when you have angina is avoiding extreme weather conditions.You may be surprised how much the outdoors can effect your condition.


It's recommended to avoid exercising outdoors if it's overly cold, hot, or humid weather conditions.
Being active in these types of weather increase your risk for experiencing a cardiac event.
If you want to stay regular and consistent with exercise during more extreme weather, move your workout indoors. Walking on the treadmill, using an indoor pool or doing a aerobic DVD inside are great alternatives.

, You may feel that because you have angina, that your total activity should be limited. However, as long as your angina is stable, you should be able to fit in about 150 minutes of cardio activity each week.


Health professionals note, that as long as your angina is stable and you have clearance from your physician, meeting the recommended activity goals each week is a safe goal.
It's recommended to aim for about 150 minutes of aerobic activity each week. Split this activity up into shorter bouts (especially if you're just starting). Try for 20 minutes 6 days a week. Or you can even do three 10 minute sessions 5 days a week.Start with lower intensity exercises like walking or water aerobics. However, overtime, if you can, build up to more moderate intensity activities like hiking, slow jogging, using the elliptical with resistance or doing an aerobics class.

, In addition to cardiovascular exercises, it's important to work on improving your muscular strength. Resistance or strength training will complement your aerobic work.


Health professionals also agree, that most strength training activities are also appropriate for you to do even if you have angina.
Aim to include about 20 minutes 1-2 times a week of muscle building exercises. You can try weight lifting, yoga or pilates.
Note that you my want to limit upper body exercises as these have been shown to cause angina more than lower body exercises., In addition to focusing on including more structured exercise, also increase your lifestyle activity. This is a great way for angina patients to stay active and safe.


Lifestyle activities are those exercises that you do on apart of your regular daily life. This might be walking to get the mail, taking the stairs, gardening, mowing the lawn or sweeping the floor.
They do not burn a lot of calories or spike your heart rate. However, they do keep you active and moving and elevate your heart rate mildly enough that you can still see aerobic benefits.Many studies have shown that structured aerobic activity and increase lifestyle activity have very similar health benefits. So if you cannot do a lot of structured activity or cannot sustain activity for long, try increasing your lifestyle activity first.

, Although being active on a regular basis is important to regaining your aerobic strength, it's still important to include regular rest days.


Health and fitness professionals recommend that you include about one or two rest days each week. If you're just starting with exercise, you may include up to three days a week.
Rest is important for a variety of reasons. For starters, it's during rest that you improve muscle strength, see increases in muscle size and aerobic endurance.Rest is also important for those suffering from angina because you need to allow your heart and cardiovascular system to rest and recover in between workouts.

, Many health professionals recommend exercise to help recover if you have angina. However, they also recommend that you be mindful of symptoms.


If you feel any type of chest pain, difficulty breathing or tightness in the chest, stop exercising immediately.After you discontinue your exercise, keep your heart rate level low. Do not restart exercise even after the pain or other discomfort has subsided. You should take a rest day.
If you notice any pain or discomfort the following day or at your next exercise session, contact your doctor immediately.

, There are a variety of medications that are prescribed to manage angina. Always carry these with you - especially when you're exercising.One of the most common prescription medications that are prescribed for those with angina is nitrogen glycerin. It's to be taken when you start to experience any symptoms. This is essential to have on you at all times.
Also, make sure that others know of your condition and where your medication is. If you were to have any symptoms and couldn't get to your medications, someone else should be able to help you.

, Another great idea to keep you safe during exercise, is to have someone with you. They can help treat any symptoms or serious issues that arise if you are unable to.Although scary to think about, symptoms can occur even if you are being treated for angina. Symptoms are generally mild, but some can be more serious and life threatening.
Since exercise can precipitate symptoms, consider bringing a friend or family member with you as you exercise. They should be someone who is familiar with your condition, medications and know what to do if an emergency arises.
Try to go to the gym together, go for walks together or bike ride together. Having someone there just in case can make exercise safer and you feel more confident.

Choose whether you want to run, walk or climb in your 20 to 30 minute quick routine.,
Put on running or walking shoes with good cushioning and arch supports.,
Calculate your maximum heart rate.,
Warm up by walking for 3 to 5 minutes at 2.8 to 4 mph (4.5 to 6.4 km/h) (MPH).,
Begin 1 minute intervals.,
Return to a resting walk or jog at 4 to 5 mph (6.4 to 8.0 km/h).,
Do 5 to 6 more intervals of 1 minute with a 2 minute rest period at the lower speed.,
Cool down by walking between 2.8 and 4 for 5 minutes.",How to Do Treadmill Routines1," This will set the pace and the incline for your interval-based workout. If your fitness level only allows you to walk on a flat surface, then you should opt for a walking workout of at least 30 minutes.;
, Wear flexible clothing, such as yoga pants or baggy shirts. Put a towel and 16 to 24 oz. (473 to 710 ml) of water on your treadmill for a healthy and safe workout.

, This is 220 minus your age. You should aim to be at 70 percent of your maximum heart rate for most of your workout, according to your treadmill's heart rate monitor.


If your treadmill does not have a heart rate monitor, you may choose to invest in a monitor that goes around your wrist, arm or stomach in order to ensure you are exercising at aerobic levels, as recommended by most doctors.

, If you plan to run or climb, you will want to warm up between 3 and 4 mph (4.8 and 6.4 km/h).

, Increase the MPH to between 5 and 6, and speed walk or jog. If you are climbing, increase the incline to between 3 and 4.

, Stay at this pace for 2 minutes.

, Experiment with raising the incline as you speed walk or jog to between 1 and 3 for a little extra resistance during your 1 minute sprints. If you are climbing, adjust your interval to between 5 and 6 for your sprints, and lower it to between 1 and 3 during your resting periods.

, Follow your treadmill workout with resistance training, small weight training or mat exercises.

Be familiar with symptoms of going too fast.",How to Increase the Intensity of Any Exercise," Walking on a regular basis is a great low-impact exercise. It comes with many of the same benefits as jogging or running but without the hit to your knees and hips.Leisurely walking is great, but increase the intensity of your walks by:


Carry a 10–15 pound backpack while you walk. The extra weight makes your body work harder and increases the intensity of your walk.Avoid ankle or wrist weights, as these can lead to injury — remember that by weighting the end of a long lever (your wrist or ankle) you are putting a great load on the pivot (the shoulder, elbow, hip or knee joints). If you wish to use them, only wear them for the first five minutes of your walk, then put them in a backpack.
Increasing the incline on your treadmill during your walk. Or, if you walk outside, find a route that has a significant amount of hills.The hills will work your legs much harder than walking on a flat surface.
Walking on the sand if you live near a beach. It's difficult to push off in the sand and makes your feet and legs work significantly harder while you're walking.Racewalking. This is a type of very fast paced walking (about 6 to 8 mph or 9.6 to 12.9 km/h). You're working out on a level close to jogging or running.;
, Increasing the intensity of your regular runs or jogs can help you increase your overall speed and endurance.Try the following to increase the intensity of your runs:


Run hills or stairs. Find a new, hilly route or increase the incline on the treadmill; however, an even better way to increase intensity is by running stairs. Find a stadium with bleachers or a park with stairs.Include intervals of sprints and moderate-paced runs. Alternating your pace back and forth increases your heart rate significantly and can also help increase speed long-term.Increase the distance of your run by 1/4 of a mile each week. The longer you go the better trained your cardiovascular system will be.If you only run three times a week, try incorporating another day or two of running. This will help give your body extra conditioning., Getting in the pool for exercise is a great way to be active. It's low-impact and high resistance.You can up the intensity of your swim by:


Doing interval training. It's recommended to increase your speed every 50–100 meters until you reach your max effort. This can help increase your speed and performance.
Also try timed sets. Complete a certain amount of laps or strokes in a shorter period of time to force yourself to go faster.

, Cycling is a great aerobic exercise. Plus, there are a lot of things you can do to increase the intensity. Try:


Taking a spin class. These classes are naturally high in intensity and cause you to work very hard.
Build your own intervals by cycling on hilly terrain, alternating between high and low speeds or using an indoor bike and increasing the resistance.
If you train outside, use slightly deflated tires which will make the bike slower and force you to work harder.Avoid cycling in the city where there is traffic, lights and stop signs. Train in an area where you can go at high speeds for long distances without having to stop.

, Unlike aerobic exercises, weightlifting activities are used to build more muscle and strength; however, there are plenty of ways you can increase the intensity of these types of exercises as well. Try:


Alternate between upper and lower body parts between each set, or pause to do some jumping jacks.
An easy way to increase the intensity of a weightlifting routine is by doing more sets or adding more reps per set.Another way to increase the intensity of your exercises is by taking longer when you're lowering a weight (for example, when you're lowering your arms back to the starting position after a bicep curl). This helps draw out the exercise and how long your muscles are working., If you're interested in just choosing a higher intensity workout or incorporating more high-intensity exercises to your workout routine, consider doing one or two HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) workouts a week.


HIIT is a specific type of training that focuses on working you up to very high intensities.Typical HIIT workouts are short in length and alternate between short bursts of very, very high-intensity exercises with short ""rest"" periods of moderate-intensity exercises.HIIT workouts burn more calories from fat and push your body into the anaerobic zone which helps you improve speed and endurance.HIIT workouts can be done with any exercise — running, cycling or swimming. For example, alternate between one minute full sprint with three minutes of a moderate jog. Repeat this cycle a few times or until you cannot continue.

, Both cardio and strength training routines are made more difficult when you combine them. Both have unique training benefits and, when paired together, can increase the intensity of your workouts.


Cardio intensity can be boosted by adding exercises like lunges, push-ups or squats. And strength training routines can be made more difficult by adding in jumping jacks or knee raises in between sets.
Combining these two types of exercises helps increase metabolism and keeps your heart rate elevated during exercise and after the exercise has been completed.This can result in increased calorie burn and helps build more muscle mass., A way to increase the intensity of both weightlifting and cardio routines is to include some explosive movements and work until ""muscle failure.""


Explosive movements are those like box jumps or Olympic lifts. These moves engage more of your muscle fibers, which can increase strength and endurance.Only add more explosive moves to one to two days of your workout routine. This helps prevent injury.
Work to ""muscle failure."" When you feel like you can't do another repetition or run a step further, force yourself to go a little further or do another rep at a lower intensity. This helps increase how hard your muscles work., Before starting any new workout or increasing the intensity or difficulty of your exercise routine, make sure you consult your doctor.


Your doctor will be able to tell you whether increasing intensity or difficulty is safe and appropriate for you.
Some higher-intensity exercises may not be appropriate for everyone at every fitness level. Discuss this with your physician.
It is normal to experience some discomfort or shortness of breath when increasing the intensity of your workout, but it's important you listen to your body and always keep your exercise intensity within a safe zone. Overdoing any activity can be harmful, and you need to be realistic and aware of your own limits.

, When you're trying to increase the intensity of your workout, there's most likely a goal behind this desire. You might want to run faster, lift more weight or cycle for a longer time. Make an exercise calendar to help you. Use a physical calendar you can write on or your smartphone or an app to help.


It's important to go slowly when first increasing the intensity and difficulty of your exercise. You can cause injury quickly if you do not proceed slowly and with caution.
Lay out a calendar for your exercise routine. Note what you're doing each week and how you're increasing the intensity by small increments each week.
Also note if you have an event, race or competition coming up. If you want to increase your pace over the course of six months before your next 10K race, it's important to plan your weekly workouts and how you're going to gradually increase the intensity.

, When you're trying to increase the intensity of your workouts, you should get familiar with tracking your heart rate and perceived exertion so you can monitor your intensity during any workout.


RPE is a scale that allows you to assess your level of exertion while exercising — by paying attention to how you feel, you can make sure your workout is safe but challenging. The scale is as follows:1: Very light exertion — Hardly any activity, but not sleeping
2 – 3: Light activity — Easy to maintain your pace and you can breathe normally. You can easily carry on a conversation.
4 – 6: Moderate activity — Noticeably more challenging. Breathing heavily, can only hold a short conversation.
7 – 8: Vigorous activity — You can only speak about one sentence. Shortness of breath, and on the verge of uncomfortable.
9: Very hard activity — Very challenging and difficult to keep up this intensity. Hard to breathe and you can only speak a word or two.
10: Maximum effort activity — Feels almost impossible; you can only do the activity for a few seconds at this intensity and you cannot even get a word out.


Track your RPE during one of your typical workouts. For example, you estimate your morning jogs to be at a five or six. Aim to increase your exertion by one or two points — jog at a seven or eight on the scale.
You can also track your heart rate. Your target heart rate is based on your age and encompasses a range of heart rates that are safe and will give you the best results. You can find charts or calculators online to give you an idea of what your target heart rate should be during exercise.
Working on the upper end of your target heart rate range means you're working out at a moderate- to high-intensity.

, Although increased intensity of physical activity is associated with many benefits, doing too much or going too hard can be dangerous.Some studies showed that continued high-intensity exercise may lead to more heart problems long-term.It's beneficial to do high intensity exercises, but alternate them with low or moderate intensity activities as well.
If you notice any acute pain in your joints, muscles or chest after doing high intensity exercise, discontinue immediately.
If you're feeling sore or have muscle fatigue, make sure to take a day of rest before starting another workout.

Assess your current level of fitness.,
Identify your goals for exercising.,
Find your target heart rate range.,
Consider your available options.",How to Do Steady State Cardio1," Steady-state cardio is best for people who have not worked out in awhile, or who have been living a relatively sedentary lifestyle and want to improve their overall fitness.While high-intensity interval training (HIIT) may be all the rage, you risk serious injury if you go into a program like that and don't have the endurance or experience to handle it.
Steady-state cardio also can be beneficial if you're starting a weight-loss program. While you won't burn as many calories with steady-state cardio as you would with higher intensity exercise, you'll recover more quickly so you can exercise for longer periods and more often.;
, Your exercise goals may impact the type of steady-state cardio you end up doing. If you're training for a particular sport or activity, choose a steady-state cardio exercise that will work the muscles you need to use the most.For example, if you're training to improve your tennis game, you might benefit from light jogging for an hour each morning.
If you want to lose weight, steady-state cardio won't offer you quick results. However, if you're able to exercise for an hour or longer, your body will stay in the fat-burning zone for a longer period of time than it would if you were doing high-intensity training.

, To do steady-state cardio, you want to keep your heart rate in the moderate range, typically under 145 beats per minute (bpm). You can find your particular range by doing a simple calculation.First, subtract your age from 220 to find your maximum heart rate. For example, if you are 28, your maximum heart rate is 192 (220 – 28 = 192).
Take your pulse to get your resting heart rate – first thing in the morning typically is the best time to do this. Then subtract your resting heart rate from your maximum heart rate to find your heart rate reserve (HRR).
For steady-state cardio, you want your heart rate to be between 45 and 50 percent of your maximum heart rate. Multiply your HRR by 0.45 and add your resting heart rate to the result. That is the low end of your target range. Find the high end of the range by changing the multiplier to 0.50.

, There are a number of different ways to get a steady-state cardio workout. While most athletes simply do time on a treadmill or elliptical machine, there are plenty of other options if this sounds boring to you.Ideally, you want to choose an activity that you actually enjoy doing – particularly if you're planning to do it for an hour or longer every day. This will keep you from getting bored too quickly.
You also want to find an exercise that feels good to you, and that doesn't cause any pain or significant discomfort. If you have any injuries or chronic medical conditions, some types of movement may be difficult for you even at a low intensity.
Cycling on a stationary bike is one of the most accessible steady-state cardio activities to do, especially if you're new to fitness. Its low-impact nature means few people have significant pain or discomfort while doing it.

Determine the best way to group your sets.,
Do single leg deadlifts.,
Practice with high knees.",How to Do the Touch and Hop Exercise2," There are two ways you can perform this exercise. You can do sets where you alternate back and forth between each leg after one rep. You can also do sets where you only do reps with the left leg, and then after completing a set, you can do a set with the right leg., Practicing single leg deadlifts can help improve your balance and flexibility. Start on one leg, your knee slightly bent. Bend forward at the hip as you lift the other leg behind you. Lower your abdomen as you lift your leg, keeping both straight. Stop when your body is parallel to the floor. In a controlled manner, lower your leg back to the floor as your raise your torso.
Repeat with the other leg.

, High knees help you get the last half of the touch and hop exercise. The jump and lift of your knee is similar to a high knee. To perform a high knee, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Lift your right knee until it is at waist level and your thigh is parallel to the floor. Lower your foot to the floor and repeat with the left leg.The higher you lift your knee so your thigh is parallel to the floor, the better. If you aren’t there yet, keep practicing and working on your flexibility.
To increase the intensity, jump as you alternate between lifting each leg.

Do this for 1 minute, then rest.",How to Do Treadmill Routines3," Grab 2 to 5 lb. (0.9 to 2.3 kg) hand weights and place them at the front of your treadmill. This routine combines cardio exercise with weight training.

, Focus on tightening your core muscles, such as your back, abs and obliques. Lift your chest up slightly and make sure your earlobes to your hips form a straight line.

, Begin by slowly completing bicep curls for 1 minute. Slowly raise and lower the weight, focusing on form as you walk, and then place the weights on the front of the treadmill and rest for 2 minutes.

, Raise your hands straight above your shoulders with your hands up. Do the exercise for 1 minute and rest for 2 minutes.

, Swing your arms from back to front. Alternate 1 hand swinging forward while the other is swinging back, as if you are exaggerating your natural walking motion.

, Repeat the exercises twice during the exercise routine. Cool down with a 5 minute walk between 2.8 and 4 without weights.


Take advantage of your own treadmill's exercise routines. If you have pre-programmed routines, experiment with hills, intervals, fat-burning and endurance programs. Most are programmed according to resistance levels. You should alternate routines in order to find out what you prefer and to work more muscles.

Select your band.,
Balance the resistance band.,
Check the bands.,
Assume the starting position.",How to Do Squats With a Resistance Band1," Resistance bands vary in tension (how much force they can resist when pulled). Usually, you will want to choose a medium-moderate tension band. If you have little to no experience doing squats or using resistance bands, try a lower tension band, which is more elastic. A high tension band is for very fit, experienced users and is more difficult to stretch.;
, This means ensuring the right and left sides of the resistance band are equal in length. To do this, grab the handles of the resistance band and dangle the elastic portion in front of you, on the floor.Place the arches of both feet firmly in the center of the band and stand up straight with your feet hip width apart.








, Make sure you have an equal length of each band on each side. To do this, keep your feet on the band and bring the handles together in front of you without stretching the band. If the handles meet in a symmetrical “kiss,” your bands are balanced.









If they are unbalanced, step off the band try to balance the resistance band again. You may need to step onto the band more than once to find its center. As you get more familiar with the resistance band, you’ll learn to more intuitively find the band’s center.

, While standing straight up, lift the handles of the resistance band above your shoulders. Keep the bands behind your arms and keep your elbows down to keep the band in place. Your hands, gripping the handles of the resistance band, should have their backs facing directly behind you and palms forward.

Focus on developing a habit.,
Increase your time gradually.,
Exercise every day.,
Switch it up.",How to Do Steady State Cardio2," If you've been a couch potato and you want to start exercising more, your first goal should be making it a part of your normal routine to get out and get moving for a little while each day.When you've led a relatively sedentary lifestyle, changing that to a more active lifestyle is the first step towards increasing your overall fitness. Steady-state cardio can be a great way to do this.
While your results will be minimal, you will improve your cardiovascular fitness and maintain muscle mass and strength. Steady-state cardio may be necessary to get your body ready for higher intensity workouts, where you will make more significant strides towards meeting your goals.

, Steady-state cardio is meant to be done at the same intensity, but for longer periods of time. If you're just beginning a fitness regimen, you may not be able to go as long at first, but you should increase your time incrementally every few sessions.For example, if you start by going for a light jog in the morning for 15 minutes, after a week you should increase your time to 20 minutes. After each week, increase your time by five-minute increments until you eventually are jogging for an hour each morning.
Be sure to plan ahead when you start your steady-state cardio program to make sure that you'll have time in your schedule to gradually increase the time. For example, if you're going for a morning jog, don't start jogging an hour before you have to leave for work. It's generally better to build the habit of exercising at the same time each day, rather than having to start earlier when you increase your time.

, If you're starting a new fitness plan with steady-state cardio, doing it every day may be easier than only doing it two or three times a week. Steady-state cardio will get you in the habit of being active, and give you more energy to do other things.Because of the low intensity, you need a lot of steady-state cardio to see any real benefit, regardless of your fitness goals. The same low intensity also means steady-state cardio is safe to do every day without risking injury.
While steady-state cardio may not be the most efficient way to lose weight, you're still burning calories and improving your overall fitness.

, After you've made daily activity part of your regular routine, gradually add in other types of exercise so you won't get bored with the repetition. Doing the same thing every day for a long period of time can cause you to plateau.Doing different activities is about more than mental boredom. When you're working your body in the same way for a longer period of time, your body will adapt to the stress of the exercise and you'll no longer get the same results.
If you want to continue working out at the same intensity, choose a different activity that works different muscle groups, or that challenges your body in a different way. For example, if you've been jogging, you might want to try cycling. If you've been cycling for awhile, you might decide to start going for a morning swim.

"
"
Evaluate your fitness goals.,
Try steady-state cardio on rest days.,
Slow things down.,
Use steady-state cardio to improve your recovery time.",How to Do Steady State Cardio3," If you've set strength-training or weight-loss goals and your progress has begun to plateau, you may be able to jump-start your program by adding steady-state cardio sessions to your overall workout routine.The low intensity of steady-state cardio means it's generally safe to do any day, or every day, of the week.
You can even do steady-state cardio on days that you have high-intensity sessions. For example, you may go for a light jog in the morning and do high-intensity strength training in the afternoon.
Steady-state cardio will improve your muscular endurance, which will enable you to work harder for longer. That will enable you to beef up your training sessions so you start progressing toward your goals again.

, Muscular endurance – which differs from cardiovascular endurance – is important for all athletes. Steady-state cardio helps you build muscular endurance, which allows you to train harder for a longer period of time.Steady-state cardio enables you to have an active recovery day, which can be helpful if you are the type of person who can't stand a day of complete inactivity even though you know you need a rest from high-intensity training.
The low intensity of steady-state cardio makes it safe to perform on rest days between higher intensity training. You can't train at a high intensity for several days in a row without getting sick or risking injury.

, Particularly if you're feeling as though you're over-training, building your aerobic base back up through steady-state cardio can be beneficial. To do this, you typically need to eliminate a few high-intensity sessions each week.If you've noticed a significant decline in overall energy or have been getting sick more often, you may need to stop high-intensity training, such as sprint intervals or CrossFit workouts, for a period of three to six months.
During that time, you can rebuild and retrain your cardiovascular system using steady-state cardio.
One way to determine whether you're over-training is to evaluate your level of exhaustion immediately after a high-intensity workout. If you're collapsed on the ground or feel like you're going to vomit, it may be time to take a break and move to steady-state cardio for a time.

, If your primary exercise focus has been strength training or body building, you can use steady-state cardio to decrease the amount of time you need to rest between sets and between workout sessions.Steady-state cardio has aerobic benefits for weight lifters because it gradually increases cardiovascular endurance. This is what allows you to take briefer rest periods between sets. The greater your cardiovascular endurance, the harder you can work for a longer period of time.
Engaging in steady-state cardio on your rest days is considered active recovery, which means you won't lose your gains in strength and muscle mass while you're resting.
If you frequently work yourself to exhaustion when lifting weights, adding steady-state cardio to your overall training regimen will enable you to recover more quickly by strengthening your heart to increase the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to your muscles.

Assume the basic squat position.,
Get low.,
Return to the starting position.,
Don’t strain yourself.,
Try a squat shoulder press.",How to Do Squats With a Resistance Band2," Remember, this means balancing the band, checking the band, and assuming the starting position.


In each hand, take one of the handles of the resistance band. Hold the handles out in front of you, each at an equal height. The elastic stretching portion of the band should be just barely touching the floor. Keep your hands level and familiarize yourself with the weight of the resistance band.
Step onto the resistance band. Make sure you’re situating yourself in the exact center of the resistance band’s elastic portion.
Stand up straight with the resistance band’s handles in your hands. The band should be stretched up and behind your arms. If someone were standing in front of you, they’d see the resistance band stretched taut in an elongated “U” shape.
Keep your abs and core tight and upright. Bend your knees slightly and keep your head and eyes facing forward.You’re now ready to begin the squat.

, Bend forward slightly from the hips, then bend your knees.Keep your back rigid and your shoulders and head up; you’re not taking a bow. Your kneecaps should extend past the end of your toes. Imagine that you’re lowering yourself into a chair behind you.









Continue to keep your abs tight, and when you’ve reached a position where you feel as if you might tip backwards, hold it for about two seconds.

, Come up slowly, using your heels to push yourself up.Continue to hold the resistance band. Don’t let go! If you let of the resistance band, you won’t be doing squats with a resistance band; you’ll just be doing squats. And anyone can do that, right? Tighten your glutes as you return to the standing position you began from.








, Especially if it’s your first time doing squats, stay conscious of your body’s movement and position. The load of the lift, when you return to a standing position, should be on your legs and hamstrings, not your back. Remember to hold on to the handles of the resistance band.Have a trainer watch you as you perform your squat to give you feedback and pointers on your technique.
If you have a friend or personal trainer familiar with how to squat with a resistance band, have him or her show you how to perform a proper squat with a resistance band. Then try it on your own, using their example to guide your own squatting efforts.

, The squat shoulder press is a variation of the basic squat with a resistance band. Assume the basic squat position and squat down. Instead of just standing up with the handles still beside you, parallel to your shoulders, extend your hands up as you rise. Raise the handles of the resistance band high above your head. Hold the position for three seconds before dropping them back down to your shoulders in preparation for another squat.







"
"
Attach your band to a squat rack.,
Sit on a medicine ball.,
Assume the squat position.,
Squat.,
Go for speed.",How to Do Squats With a Resistance Band3," Sling the handles around the safety bars extending out from the squat rack. The distance from one handle to the other should be about one meter. The ends of the resistance band should sit at two parallel points at about waist height.For a more intense workout, affix the resistance band so the handles are just below waist height. The lower the points at which the band is anchored, the more challenging this exercise will be.
Ensure your band is securely fastened and there is no risk of it snapping back on you or a bystander.

, The medicine ball should be situated directly between the two points where the band is anchored. Use one slightly larger than a basketball; its weight is irrelevant since you won’t be lifting it. The ball is only a marker to let you know how deep you’re squatting. For a more intense workout, use a smaller ball.







, Unlike the standard, basic squat, you will not hold the resistance band in this exercise. The band will remain fastened to the squat rack or other immobile object. The only points of contact you will have with the band will be your neck and arms.


Wrap the band around the back of your neck so that it loops over your shoulders. Hook the inside of your elbows into the band.
With the band still hooked behind your neck and over your shoulders, push yourself off the medicine ball into a standing position. Keep your feet shoulder width apart and bend your knees slightly. Like in all other squats, your core and abs should be tight and your shoulders should be pushed back. Sit your hips back and put your weight on your heels. Focus your eyes on a point about six feet ahead of you.

, Bend slightly forward and drop your butt to the surface of the ball. When you’ve just barely touched the surface of the ball, push yourself back up with your heels using as much force as you can. Try to jump up from the squat. Don’t be afraid to let your feet leave the ground. Return to the upright starting position, keeping your gluteal muscles tight as you do so.








This exercise will help you develop a more powerful lower body and train your muscular endurance.

, After you’ve gotten the basic technique down, test yourself with a speed squat variation. Go up and down from the ball to a standing “ready” position as fast as possible, for 10-20 reps. Don’t bounce off the ball; barely touch it before launching yourself back up. Each time you come up and down, aim to do so at the same speed. This will help you build endurance.








Be careful not to let your knees collapse (angle inward toward each other).

"
Set up the resistance band.,
Pick up your kettle bells.,
Assume the basic squat position.,
Descend in a squatting motion.,
Hold it.,
Return to a standing position.",How to Do Squats With a Resistance Band4," Unlike the standard, basic squat, you will not hold the resistance band in this exercise. The band will remain fastened to the squat rack or other immobile object. The only point of contact you will have with the band will be the back of your neck.


Affix the band to a point on the floor approximately one meter ahead of you. Make sure it’s latched securely on a heavy, immobile piece of gym equipment such as a squat rack. Facing the point on the floor to which the band is affixed, wrap the loop of the band around the back of your neck., For this exercise, you will use kettle bells to balance and build strength. Put them in the front rack position, with each kettle bell resting on your shoulder/upper arm. Grip the handles with each hand and keep your palms facing inward, towards one another. Your thumbs should be just under -- almost touching -- your chin. Keep your elbows angled out and away from you and your palms facing each other.









The weight of the kettle bell depends on your fitness level. Try starting with two twenty pound weights and work up from there.
You could also substitute a bar bell in place of the kettle bells., Tighten your stomach muscles and upper body. Position each foot below its corresponding shoulder. In other words, keep your right foot in a vertical line with your right shoulder, and your left foot in line with your left shoulder. Bend slightly at the knees. With your eyes and head up and looking ahead, you’re ready to begin the squat., Unlike in the standard squat, do not make a slight bend forward as you go down; the pull from the resistance band may cause you to topple over. Keeping your neck and back rigid, bend gently at the knees and come down until your bottom almost touches the ground. At your lowest point, your butt should be lower than your kneecaps. Your knees will be angled out, away from each other, and extend past your toes.









If your thigh and shin form a 90˚ angle at your knee, you’re being pulled forward too much, or are not squatting low enough., Hold your position at the bottom of your squat for three to four seconds. Keep your back rigid and your shoulders and head up. You should be able to feel the pull of the resistance band on the back of your neck, tugging your head down and your body forward. Lean back into the band and keep your neck rigid. Do not let yourself hunch over.In this exercise, by resisting the pull of the resistance band, you will build the musculature in your upper back.

, Push up off the ground with your heels and come to a full stand. Keep your back and neck rigid as you rise. Keep the weights in your hand and resistance band around your neck until you are ready to finish your workout.









When you've completed 12-15 reps (repetitions) two or three times (sets), move on to a different exercise pattern. As you gain confidence and strength in your resistance band squatting technique, increase the number of reps and sets you do with each workout session.
When you have completed your workout, place your weights on the floor, then pull the resistance band from behind your neck over your head. Do not attempt to disentangle yourself from the resistance band before putting your weights down.

Stretch your hands forward in a rounded back stretch.,
Rotate your head down.,
Stretch your upper trapezius by performing lateral neck flexions.,
Perform a shoulder squeeze.",How to Stretch the Upper Back1," Clasp your hands together, and drop your chin to your chest. Reach your arms straight forward. As you do so, you should be pulling the shoulders forward. Hold the pose for a few breaths before releasing.
, Look diagonally down to the bottom of your shirt. Hold your gaze for 20 seconds and then pull your head back into a straight position. This will stretch your your levator scapulae muscles between your neck and back.








, Look straight forward. Tilt your neck so that your ear is dropping towards your shoulder. While you do this, your chin should not drop. Make sure your shoulder does not lift or raise. Hold this pose for between ten and thirty seconds.







, This exercise will contract the muscles rather than stretch them, but it can provide relief if your upper back is stiff, tight, or sore. Rest your shoulder blades and then slowly pull them back towards each other. Your chest will thrust forward as your back muscles are contracted. Go back to starting position, then repeat the squeeze.

Sit on the floor.
Press the soles of your feet together (butterfly position).
Pull your feet as close to your body as possible.
Put your hands on your ankles to where your elbows are lined up with your knees.
Push against your elbows trying to close your legs. (This contracts your groin muscles to help you get a deeper stretch.)
Push your knees down.

,









Reach both hands behind you and then up over your head (as if to perform a butterfly stroke in swimming).
Continue to swing your arms over your head and out in front of you.
Try to keep both arms parallel to the floor as you are holding the stretch.
To maintain balance, sit back slightly with your knees partially bent.

,









Incline your head forward, but do not roll your head from side to side-this is dangerous. Instead, stretch your neck to the left, right, forward and back, but always return to center first!
Tilt your head with ear toward shoulder, incline your head backward and roll your head from left to right, then right to left in a 30 degree motion.
Be sure that while your head is tilted back, you keep your jaw relaxed and even let your mouth fall open just a bit.

,









Incline your head back, rest your chin on your palm, and pull your jaw open.
Say ""Ah!"" (you can mime it).
Grab your chin with your thumb, index and middle fingers.
Stretch it left to right. This exercise will help if you have been hit to the jaw (e.g., knocked-out in boxing).

, The only reason it feels good to stretch even when you're cold is because your body sends out natural painkillers. To protect your tissues, you need to raise your cardiac pulse in order to fill them with blood. The only way to do this is by working out.


Swimming is the safest way to raise your cardiac pulse. Water reduces shocks to the body because it reduces the felt effect of gravity on your body.
Jumping rope can also be effective, but it may damage your tibia's periosteums, which is the membrane enveloping your bones (except at junctions) that allows the blood to flow from your heart to your muscles connected by the tendon.
Swimming pools are sometimes inaccessible, so an efficient and safe way to raise cardiac pulse would be by cycling (except if you have knee problems).

, It will result with less gain than improvement on the muscle part. The CNS naturally provides resistance by stimulating antagonists muscles when you flex a muscle to prevent it from being too stretched and tear your conjunctive tissues. Never stretch prior to workout, and always do it after.

, Stretching will ensure you have an optimal circulation of body fluids throughout your system and an adequate flexibility which will prevent your connective tissues to pop when you contract your muscle.

They work abdominal muscles since you are keeping the body upright, and they offer upper body arm workout., A spin bike most closely resembles the “real” activity of riding a bike. It's one of the best bikes at burning calories. Spin bikes are meant for those who want a strenuous, effective workout., Recumbent bikes provide an all-body workout while working all the major muscles. The position of the recumbent seat ensures that you are exercising while maintaining good spinal posture. Recumbent bikes are easier on the lower back and gentle on your joints., Whether you want to reduce body fat, get stronger or make fitness a part of your routine, an exercise bike is a great start. Ultimately, quality is what you are aiming for. You will need to balance quality with the needs of your exercise bike and your workout goals. It is easier to decide on which bike to buy once you know what your fitness goals are., The best exercise bikes use enough padding and a comfortable design, with enough adjustments to achieve the best fit., Pedals should be adjustable with spring-loaded clips on the outer edge of each pedal to hold your feet in place. They should work smoothly, and the bike shouldn’t be noisy. Larger pedals are available for wider feet. , Exercise bikes should let you adjust routines based on your fitness level, and have heart-rate-controlled workouts that consider your age, weight, and gender., A good display should show some combination of your heart rate, calories burned, speed, revolutions per minute (RPM), and resistance levels, and details such as time and distance. , There is a bike for every budget. If you prefer a more luxurious feel to your bike, then you might want to plan for a larger budget of $500 and above. If you only need basic features, then consider a less expensive model that costs less than $500., Make sure the bike fits you properly. It is important that the seat height is correct, and you're not sitting too far away from the handlebars. Make sure that your feet don't slip while you pedal., Resistance levels help you vary your workouts. You can also warm up and cool down by gradually increasing or lowering the resistance level., Stability is important in an exercise bike. If the bike wobbles, it is probably not the right weight for you.

Sit on the floor with legs straight in front of you.,
Do a standing pike stretch.",How to Get a More Flexible Back1," Start by reaching arms upwards. Gently lean forward and reach towards your toes. This stretches both the hamstrings, leg muscles, and the lower back. For a more advanced version, keep your back completely straight as you lean over. Advanced or more flexible stretchers can reach past feet.


The goal is not actually to reach your toes (or not), but to straighten and lengthen the back. A mistake in form is to be focused on the feet rather than the back. This is a back exercise, not a foot-grabbing game.
Use props to get the form proper. Therabands, rolled up towels and belts can all be used to get into a modified form. This is not cheating; it is using tools to help you stretch.;
, While standing erect, bend forward at the waist and reach towards the ground. Bend forward far enough to feel a comfortable stretch in the back and legs.

Check dorsiflexion mobility.,
Point your toes.,
Move your ankle to the side.,
Move your foot in circles.,
Sit back on flexed ankles.,
Stretch your toes up.,
Practice ankle raises.,
Do flutter kicks.,
Use an exercise band.",How to Increase Ankle Mobility," Check your ankle dorsiflexion mobility with a lunge test. Place a piece of tape on the floor four inches from the wall. Line your dominant foot up with the tape, and relax the other foot behind you. Then, lean forward on your dominant foot and try to touch your knee to the wall.The knee should go straight forward. It should not track inwards or outwards while you flex.
For the test to be successful, your dominant foot should remain completely on the ground, including the heel.
If you can’t touch the wall from this point, move forward incrementally until you can. This will give you a starting point by which to measure your progress.;
, Another simple test of ankle mobility is to start lying flat on your back with your feet perpendicular to the ground. From there, slowly point your toes as far out from your body as you can manage and hold for a few seconds at your maximum endpoint.The optimal range of motion for this test is a 30 degree difference, though anywhere between 20 and 30 degrees is acceptable.
If you can create a visually straight or near-straight line between your foot and your shin, you pass the test.

, Start lying down with your legs fully extended and your feet perpendicular to the ground. One at a time, push your foot out to the side as far as it will go, and hold at your maximum endpoint for a few seconds.Do not rotate your feet from your hips. Focus on isolating the ankle and creating all motion from there.
The further to the side you can get, the better your overall ankle mobility.

, From a seated position and focusing on one foot at a time, rotate your ankle clockwise 10 to 15 times. Once completed on each foot, rotate each foot counterclockwise 10 to 15 times.Aim to do two to three sets of 10 to 15 reps each.
For best results, flex your ankles by pointing or curling your toes.

, Kneel with your legs going directly behind you, and extend point your toes out as far as they will go so that the tops of your feet are touching your mat or floor. Gently start to sit back on top of your feet, using your bodyweight to create a deep stretch in your ankles.Rest in your maximum down position for 15 to 20 seconds before slowly bringing yourself back up and relieving the pressure on your ankle.
Only lower yourself as far as your ankles can take. If you feel unmanageable pain or excess stress on your ankles or feet, bring yourself up immediately and untuck your ankles.

, Stand facing a wall and raise up the toes of your right foot, leaning them against the wall to form a triangle with it, your foot, and the floor. Gently press your body forward and shift just enough weight onto the raised foot that you feel a stretch. Keep leaning until you feel a deep stretch, and hold for fifteen or so seconds.Repeat on the left foot for every set done on the right foot.
Try two or three sets of the stretch for each foot.

, Place your ankles and feet together and slowly raise yourself upward onto the ball of your feet as high as you can go. Once you have reached your maximum height, lower your feet back down in a controlled motion.If you have weak ankles or low ankle mobility, start small with a set of 10 or 15 raises. As your strength improves, add three to five raises at a time, slowly building up to more challenging sets.
Ankle raises help strengthen not only the ankles, but the calf muscles as well.

, Lie on your back and lift your legs as high into the air as you can get them. Use your elbows and shoulders to support you as necessary. Once you are in the most vertical position you can achieve, straighten your legs, point, your toes, and make a series of small, fast, alternating kicks back and forth for a minute at a time.If you’ve never performed this exercise before, you may need to start with your legs parallel to the ground rather than perpendicular. Support yourself with your elbows and forearms and make the same kicking motion as the vertical kicks.

, Strap one end of your exercise band around something sturdy, such as a table leg, and slip the other end around your ankle. Walk forward until you feel some resistance on the band. Then, with the band around your ankle, lunge forward until your knee is directly over your foot.Repeat two or three sets of this exercise with five to ten reps per foot in each set.
Do not over-tension the band or it could snap and potentially cause injury. You should feel light resistance, but the band should not actively be pulling your ankle back in your neutral stance.

March in place.,
Do a hip roll.,
Squat and pump your arms towards the ground.,
Try a side knee crunch.,
Roll your body.,
Twist your upper body.,
Do a standing bicycle crunch.",How to Do Dance Aerobics1," It is important to warm up at the beginning of a workout to increase your body temperature and get your blood pumping. A warmup is usually just a lower intensity version of your normal workout that last from about five to 10 minutes.Marching in place is an easy way to warm up your muscles and get your heartrate up.








To march in place, stand in one place and then start marching while pumping your arms back and forth.
Do this for about three to five minutes.;
, Hip rolls work your abdominal muscles and give you a bit of a stretch as well. Stretching before a workout won’t prevent injuries, but it can increase your flexibility and range of motion.By doing a hip roll before you do more challenging moves, you might be able to flex your body more than you thought you could.








Plant your feet on the ground so that they are a little more than shoulder width apart and bend your knees slightly. Then, place your hands on your hips and move your hips in a circle. As you do this, keep your feet firmly planted on the ground.
Repeat this motion a few times and then change directions.

, Squats work your thighs, but you can add some movement to a squat to engage your upper body too. Try squatting down so that your knees are at 90 degree angles. Then, make your hands into fists and pump them towards the floor.








Alternate sides as you pump your arms downwards.
Do this move for about one to two minutes.

, You don’t need to lay on the floor to get an ab workout. You can do crunches while you are standing up. Try standing with your feet about shoulder width apart and place your hands behind your head, just like you would if you were doing crunches on the floor.








Then, lift one knee up towards the side of your body. As you do this, you should feel your obliques contracting. Your obliques are the muscles on the side of your abdomen.
Make sure that you switch sides after about 10 repetitions.
You can also crunch your knees up towards your chest one at a time to work the front of your abs.

, After your body is nice and warm from moving, you can try some full body rolls. These slower exercises will work muscles from your chest to your legs. To do a body roll, plant your feet about shoulder width apart, bend your knees slightly, and begin rotating your hips and chest.








You can place your hands on your hips, or hold your arms up over your head and move them around as well.
Try doing some body rolls during a slower tempo song or whenever you need to catch your breath.

, Upper body twists work your abs and adding a knee lift will work your lower body as well. To do an upper body twist with a knee lift, place your feet about shoulder width apart and lift your hands and arms so they are about even with your chest. Then, begin twisting your upper body from side to side.








When you feel ready to add a knee lift, start counting and on the count of three, lift your knee. Repeat this move about 10 times on each side.
If you can’t do the knee lift yet, then just focus on the twist. Or, you can also try squatting down a little to work your legs instead of doing the knee lift.

, You may be familiar with the bicycle crunch, which is where you lay down on the floor and alternate your knees towards your chest while rotating your upper body in the opposite direction. You can do a variation of this crunch while you are standing up.








To do a standing bicycle crunch, place your hands behind your head and plant your feet about shoulder width apart. When you are ready, lift your right knee and, at the same time, crunch your upper body forward and tap your right knee with your left elbow.
Do the same thing on the opposite side, so that your left knee touches your right elbow. Continue crunching for one minute.

Discontinue any activity that made you lose your breath.,
Take long, deep breaths instead of short, shallow breaths.,
Breathe while lying flat on the floor.,
Try breathing through pursed lips.",How to Catch Your Breath1," If you experience a sudden shortness of breath during physical activity, the first thing you should do is temporarily discontinue that activity. Take a break from whatever you're doing and give yourself at least a few minutes to sit down and rest until you catch your breath.Sit down, relax your shoulders, and focus on your breath.
Do not attempt to resume any strenuous activities until you've caught your breath. Even then, you may want to talk to your doctor to determine the cause before resuming strenuous activities.;
, If you're feeling short of breath, your natural instinct may be to try and breathe as rapidly as possible. However, this can actually make your situation worse. The best way to catch your breath is by taking long, slow, deep breaths down into your diaphragm.Sit or lie down in a comfortable position. Try to relax your neck and shoulders.
Take a slow, deep breath into your diaphragm (below your ribs). Your inhalation should be slow and spread out over two to five seconds.
Feel your belly rise as you inhale, and hold the breath for two to five seconds.
Exhale slowly through your mouth. If you want, you can also press gently on your belly to put pressure on the diaphragm.
Repeat until you feel like your breath has stabilized.

, Some people find that lying on the floor can make breathing easier. It allows you to stretch out your body and facilitates an easier flow of air into your lungs without the pressure that may come with sitting or standing.Lie on a blanket or rug to make the floor a little more comfortable.
Keep your back and neck straight with your legs outstretched and just slightly apart. Your arms should be at your sides without touching your body, and your palms should be open and facing up.
Breathe through your nose, and keep your mouth closed. The hairs in your nostrils can help filter out dust and other irritants from the air.
Breathe deeply through the abdomen. You should feel your belly rising and falling with each breath.
Repeat until your normal breathing patterns resume.

, Breathing through pursed lips can help slow down your respiration rate and ensure that you get adequate air into your lungs. You should continue to inhale as you would for normal deep-breathing exercises, then exhale slowly by forcing the air out of your mouth.Breathe in slowly through your nostrils. Extend the inhalation over two to five seconds.
Purse your lips. Your mouth should look and feel as though you're about to blow out a candle.
Breathe out through your pursed lips. Your exhalation should be very slow and extended over two to five seconds.
Continue breathing through pursed lips until you feel like your respiration has returned to normal.

Think about your strength imbalances.,
Attach your band to a squat rack.,
Place the band around your leg.,
Pick up your weights.,
Lean on it.,
Prepare to perform a squat.,
Move your body into a lower position.",How to Do Squats With a Resistance Band5," Often when we do squats, we favor one side or another of our bodies, leaning more heavily on our right or left foot. With a resistance band, we can correct this imbalance by forcing ourselves to shift weight and turn our hips toward the leg we usually do not favor. This exercise will also strengthen weak quads (the muscles of the the thigh) by pulling the knee forward.

, Wrap the resistance band around a heavy fixed object such as a squat rack. Position it at a level on the same plane as your knee or upper shin.








Ensure your band is securely fastened and there is no risk of it snapping back on you or a bystander.
In this exercise, you will not hold the handles of the resistance band. The band will only touch the back of your leg. It will remain fastened to the squat rack or some other immobile object.

, Slip whichever leg you want to strengthen through the band. If, for instance, you usually shift your weight to your right leg, wrap the band around your left leg. Then, stand about one meter away from the point at which the band is affixed and place your left foot into the loop so that the band is touching the space right behind your knee.Ideally, the band will be pulling the leg straight out, but it is also acceptable for the band is affixed to a squat rack at a slight angle.

, You can use either kettle bells or a barbell. If using a barbell, place the bar behind your neck and lift it off the rack with both hands. Angle your neck down slightly to better allow the weight to be borne on your shoulders. If using kettle bells, pick them up and assume the front rack position, with each kettle bell resting on your shoulder/upper arm. Hold each kettle bell by the handle, letting it hang off the ends of your fingers. They should sit on or near your shoulders or inner deltoids. Your palms should face inward, towards each other. Place your thumbs a bit under your chin. Angle your elbows away from your body, and make each of your palms face the palm on the opposite side of your body.









Don’t round your spine when lifting kettle bells. This could cause injury and places an undue strain on your back. Squat down to pick the kettle bells up, and keep your back rigid in a vertical or slight diagonal orientation when standing up., Put more weight on the leg which has the band wrapped around it to ensure it doesn’t slide.This will help train you to use both legs, rather than just your dominant leg, when lifting. As you continue to use the resistance band to correct your weak leg’s strength imbalance, your body will develop muscle memory and you’ll eventually be able to assume the same strength-correcting position without using the resistance band.








, Preparing to do a squat requires a few specific physical actions. First, tense your arms, neck, shoulders, and belly muscles. Next, relax at the knees. Your thigh and calf should form an obtuse angle measuring approximately ten degrees.Your eyes and head should face forward.Maintain this position until it is time to perform the squat.

, Bend forward slightly from the hips, then bend your knees.Your back should remain stiff and your head and shoulders should be oriented in a forward direction. Your kneecaps should reach beyond the tips of your toes.









Continue to keep your abdomen tight. When you feel you've squatted as low as possible without falling backward, freeze.
After two or three seconds, return to the starting position. Come up slowly, using your heels to push yourself up.Tighten your glutes as you return to the standing position you began from.

, Kneel on a yoga mat. Place your palms on the mat in front of you, and stretch forward. Your head should lower between your arms, and your butt should press back towards your feet. Hold this pose for 20 to 60 seconds before slowly rising back up. This will help target your trapezius muscles., Lay facedown on a yoga mat with your palms flat on the floor on either side of your head. Slowly raise your head. As you straighten your arms, your back will arch. The straighter your arms are, the more arched your back will be. Hold your shoulders down and back. This can help stretch your trapezius muscles while releasing tension in the rest of your back."

While standing or kneeling with your feet (or knees) shoulder-width apart, push your hips forward and lean back until you feel a stretch.",How to Get a More Flexible Back2," This can be done with or without supporting yourself with your hands.


This is an intermediate yoga pose, and not one that should be done with a sore or stiff back or without guidance from a knowledgeable instructor.
If you cannot sink backwards enough to reach the heels, use yoga blocks or other props to support your back. Again--this is a challenging pose. Supports can help reach this goal, not be a ""cheat"".

Include some short bursts of high speed moves.,
Add a jump.,
Incorporate your arms.,
Change up the pattern.,
Contract your abdominal muscles.",How to Do Dance Aerobics2," One easy way to increase the intensity of your aerobic dance workout is to go faster now and then. Even a short burst of speed once every few minutes can raise your heart rate and help you burn more calories.








For example, you can try to pump your arms a little faster for 30 seconds out of every three minutes. Or, try lifting your knees a bit faster while you do side knee crunches.

, Another good way to up the intensity is to add some jumping to your dance aerobic workout. Jumping is a high impact exercise and it burns more calories than low impact exercises. For example, jumping rope burns over 1,000 calories per hour for someone who weight 200 pounds!If you want to add some jumping to your dance aerobic routine, then try adding a jump at the end of a move sequence.


For example, you could do a jumping jack in between each side knee crunch, or hop in the air after you pump your arms downwards three times.

, Instead of just using your legs, get your arms involved too. Adding an arm movement to a move will add some intensity so that you burn more calories. For example, you can raise your arms above your head while you are doing body rolls and wave them around. Or, add a punch as you bring your leg down after a leg lift.








, Trying a different pattern can also help to up the intensity of your dance aerobic workout. For example, instead of doing 10 repetitions on one side of your body, try alternating back and forth. Or, follow a single-single-double pattern by doing one rep on each side and then two reps on one side.









Just make sure that you work both sides of your body evenly.

, Contracting your core muscles while you dance will help you to tone your core muscles more effectively.You may be contracting your abdominal muscles without realizing it, but it is a good idea to check.









To engage your core muscles, try to tighten your abdominal muscles as if you are using them to pull your body upwards or to brace yourself against someone trying to push you over.
Engaging your core muscles might be easier to do when you are using them, such as when you do a side knee crunch or while you are rolling your body.

"

Wear the right gear.,
Clear a space for your workout.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Stop if you feel any discomfort.",How to Do Dance Aerobics3," Dance aerobics can vary from low impact to high impact depending on what you feel comfortable doing. For these reasons, you should wear a good pair of sneakers and some clothing that will move with your body. Wearing a sports bra is also a good idea.Try stretchy materials, such as lycra and spandex. Or go with some loose fitting sweatpants and a t-shirt.

, You can do dance aerobics in a small to medium sized space, such as your living room or bedroom. However, you will need to make sure that you have an open, clear space to move around. If there are any tables or chairs that might get in your way, move them to the sides of the room before you start your workout.

, It is important to stay hydrated while you exercise, so keep a glass or a bottle of water nearby. Drink some water before you get started, during your workout, and after you finish your workout as well.


You will need to drink between 1.5 to 2.5 cups of water to replace the fluids you lose from sweating. If you work out at a high intensity or for more than an hour, then you may need to drink even more water., Exercising is good for you, but it can cause pain if you overexert yourself. Make sure that you do not push yourself too hard and that you stop if you start to feel any discomfort.


For example, if you feel short of breath, have pain in any part of your body, or feel exhausted, then stop the workout right away."

Try using bronchodilators.,
Quit smoking and avoid second-hand smoke.,
Avoid pollutants, chemicals, and scented products.,
Lose weight if you are obese or overweight.,
Treat anxiety.,
Stay at lower elevations.",How to Catch Your Breath2," Bronchodilators are medications that help physically open your airways. However, bronchodilators are not for everyone. They are most effective for treating an asthma attack, so bronchodilators may not help your shortness of breath if you do not have asthma.Many bronchodilators incorporate a corticosteroid to help ease breathing and improve air flow. These medications are typically only available by prescription, so talk to your doctor if you think bronchodilators may help you.
Common bronchodilators include Aerobid, Albuterol, Azmacort, Flovent, Medrol, and prednisone.

, Smoking is one of the biggest causes of shortness of breath. Even if you don't smoke, being around other people's second-hand smoke can irritate your lungs and make breathing difficult. If you're currently a smoker, you should quit as soon as possible. You should also avoid being around smokers, regardless of whether or not you yourself smoke.Ask your family, friends, and coworkers to help you quit smoking. Ask them to keep an eye on you and stop you from smoking any time you're tempted.Use smoke cessation products like nicotine gum, patches, and lozenges. All of these products are available over the counter without any prescription.Try to manage your stress and avoid triggers that make you crave tobacco.

, Products with a strong scent or a significant air particle presence can adversely affect your breathing. Even household chemicals like cleaning products, candles, and perfumes can affect your ability to breathe.If you must use household chemicals like cleaning products, make sure you do so in a well-ventilated area. Turn on a fan and open all the windows to allow your home to air out.
If you work with chemicals, take safety precautions by using a respirator and any workplace ventilation options at your disposal.

, Being overweight can make it difficult to breathe, especially during mild to moderate physical activity. If you believe that your breathing difficulties may be caused by a weight problem, talk to your doctor about a weight-loss plan to help you safely and effectively reduce your weight.Focus on eating healthy, low-calorie meals. Avoid anything greasy, fatty, or high in sugar.Increase the amount of exercise you get. Talk to your doctor about how to do this safely.
Once you get approval from your doctor, aim to get at least 150 minutes each week of moderate exercise, or 75 minutes each week of higher-intensity aerobic exercise.

, Some individuals who are prone to anxiety might experience breathing problems during a panic attack. This usually involves a rapid heartbeat, short, shallow breathing patterns, and an overwhelming sense of fear or dread.Talk to your doctor if you believe you may have an anxiety disorder. Having your anxiety diagnosed is the first step in treating the symptoms.


Anti-anxiety medications may help reduce the symptoms of a panic attack, which can include shortness of breath.
Common anxiety medications include benzodiazepines and selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can also be very effective at treating anxiety. Though it may not help during an active panic attack, CBT can help manage your anxiety and reduce the overall frequency/intensity of panic attacks.

, Any type of physical exertion at elevations above 5,000 feet (1,524 meters) can impair your ability to breathe. You may also experience elevation sickness at high elevations if you are not properly acclimated. If you experience the symptoms of elevation sickness, including headaches, confusion/disorientation, and difficulty breathing, it's important that you return to lower elevations as soon as possible.Elevation sickness usually goes away after returning to a lower elevation. Common treatments and preventative measures for elevation sickness include:


taking medications like Acetazolamide, Dexamethazone, Methazolamide, and Sildenafil
taking natural supplements like gingko, vitamin C, and other antioxidants
staying hydrated
adjusting to higher elevations gradually over several days

Know when to see a doctor.,
Learn about possible causes of acute shortness of breath.,
Understand the causes of chronic shortness of breath.",How to Catch Your Breath3," Depending on your symptoms, you may need to see a doctor to treat your breathing difficulties. Some breathing problems are symptomatic of a more serious health problem.See a doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms:


difficulty breathing while lying flathigh fever and/or chills
swelling in the feet and ankles
feeling winded from walking up a flight of stairs
feeling out of breath while doing moderate walking on a level surface
wheezing while you breathe during physical activity
chronic coughing and persistent gasping for air

, If you experience a sudden onset of shortness of breath (called acute shortness of breath), it could be caused by many possible conditions. If you do not have any pain or other symptoms associated with your shortness of breath, it could be a simple case of overexertion. However, it could also be a more serious medical problem.Talk to your doctor right away to assess whether you have any other medical issues. Common ailments associated with acute shortness of breath include, but are not limited to:


asthma
broken ribs
carbon monoxide poisoning
collapsed lung
elevation sickness
fluid build up around the heart or lungs
heart attack
heart failure
low blood pressure
obstruction in the upper airways
pulmonary embolism
pulmonary infection (pneumonia)
sudden loss of blood

, Chronic (or long lasting) shortness of breath is usually caused by a medical problem. It could be something relatively benign and easy to fix, like being unaccustomed to physical activity. However, many of the conditions that cause chronic breathing problems are very serious. Talk to your doctor to evaluate your overall health if you've experienced breathing problems lasting longer than two weeks.Common conditions associated with chronic breathing problems include, but are not limited to:

Find a good spot to do a handstand.,
Stretch your limbs and joints.,
Grab a spotter.,
Stand up straight with your feet comfortably apart.,
Kick with your dominant leg.,
Tip your body forward.,
Keep your arms straight as your hands approach the ground.,
Straighten your legs and torso toward the sky.,
Balance your weight on your hands.,
When you are ready to come down, split your legs and drop your dominant leg to the ground.,
End the Handstand with a finish.,
Kick up to a handstand.",How to Do a Handstand1," You'll need a place with lightly padded ground, since you'll be hitting the floor a few times before you're able to stand correctly on your hands. The park or your yard is an excellent choice, since the grass will give you a nice soft landing and you'll have plenty of open space to work with. This will help to ensure that you don't fall into someone or something, and that you don't hurt yourself.


Look for a flat area, rather than a hilly area. It'll be a lot easier to execute the handstand where it's flat.
Other great spots to do a handstand are on the sand at the beach, on gym mats at the gym, or in a carpeted room in your home.
;
, It's important to warm up a bit before you launch into your handstand. You want your muscles to feel nice and loose, and your body to feel limber. This will decrease the chance that you'll get injured. Do the following stretches to get into gear:


Roll your wrists, ankles, and neck until they're nice and loose.
Put your feet together and bend down to touch your toes. Try to keep your legs straight. Hold for 30 seconds, stand up, and repeat the stretch with your legs about a foot apart.
Take a quick jog around the block to help loosen your muscles. There's no need to run very far; just go until you feel warmed up and ready for a physical challenge.

, The first time you do a handstand, it helps to have someone nearby to help hold you in position until you get the hang of balancing correctly. Ask a friend or family member to stand in front of you at first to catch your legs and hold you straight.


Once you can do the handstand without help, ask your spotter not to catch your legs unless you're about to topple over.
Having a spotter isn't absolutely necessary. You can perfect your handstand on your own, or try doing it against a wall (see the next method).


, This is your starting position. Your feet, knees, torso and head should all be aligned and completely vertical. Hold your arms comfortably at your side.


Some people like to start with their arms straight above their head. You can try both ways and choose the starting position that feels most comfortable to you.


, Then as you kick fall into a lunge, your dominant leg bent and in front and your other leg straight, It shouldn't be very deep but should give you enough power to kick up. Make sure to kick and lunge straight forward, and not to one side or the other. Stepping to the side will cause your body to twist when you go into the handstand, making it much harder to balance.

, As you fall into a lunge, let your body tip over your lunged leg like a see-saw. Hold your arms straight and move your head toward the ground. Move with a bit of force in a natural, forward motion over your lunged leg. This will allow for a balanced system over your lunged leg, where gravity actually aids in the handstand, rather than restricting it.


The most common mistake is to throw your hands straight down at the ground and try to throw your legs upward. This results in a whipping motion and causes you to fall forward.

, Think of your self as a T, Your base leg being the vertical part and your arms and dominant leg being the horizontal part. Keep yourself in this T position until your base leg leaves the ground. Your shoulders should be tight in toward your neck, as though you were shrugging. Don't let your shoulders sag upwards or your elbows bend, which puts you at greater risk for injury.

, The act of stepping forward, tipping over, striking the ground with your hands and lifting your legs should be one smooth, fluid motion that ends in a handstand.


Keep your head tucked in,as it would be if you were standing up, and your back and legs straight. Don't throw your head back. This will only result in your handstand arching your back and hurting. This won't look as impressive, either.
Keep your legs tightly together. Keeping your legs straight and pressed firmly together typically helps you from wanting to fall to the side.

, Keep your weight between your palms and your first knuckles. Adjust your hands to balance your weight by moving it toward your fingers; you're more likely to loose balance if your roll it back toward your wrists.

, Start to stand up and as you do put your other leg on the ground.


Keep your chest up as you stand up and look up.
Keep your arms by your ears.

,


End your handstand with your arms by your ears .
Let your arms fall farther away from your head and turn your palms outwards., Make sure your weight is over your shoulders so that you can fall backwards. To start of with, bend your arms and tuck into a roll. As you get better at this skill you can try to do it with straight arms, this is the correct way to do it. Teach your body to absorb shock instead of hardening your muscles on impact. Never take too much weight onto one arm or one ankle. Make sure that you tuck your head to your chest before you roll out, as you could fall on your head a little harder than you would like.


Another way to fall without hurting yourself is to drop into a ""crab back"", ""arch"", or a ""bridge"", if you are flexible enough.

Take criticism with grace.",How to Be Graceful," People who are graceful are known to be in control of their bodies. They don’t tend to trip over their own feet or to let their limbs wildly flail, knocking over vases or cups of coffee. They carry themselves well and are comfortable in their own skin. If you want to be graceful, then you have to work on being aware of what your body is doing and where it is going at all times. This may sound easy to do, but you’d be surprised by how often people get distracted and don’t realize that they are invading another person’s space or sitting in an awkward position.


You don’t have to be a bodybuilder to be in control of your own body or to feel comfortable in your own skin. Still, working out, whether you’re running or rock climbing, helps you feel in touch with your own body.;
, If you want to be graceful, then you have to stand up tall and proud and maintain a straight back even when you’re sitting. It can be tempting to slouch if you’re tired or just want to relax a bit, but if you get in the habit of having a straight back, you won’t even be bothered by having proper posture after a while. Even if the people you’re talking to tend to slouch, you shouldn’t follow suit just to mimic them. Work on standing tall and keeping your eyes straight ahead instead of looking at the ground if you’re walking and you’ll instantly look more graceful.Having correct posture also helps you have confident body language. People who are graceful are also known to be confident because they’re proud of what they have to bring to the world. Slouching or curling up makes it look like you’re trying to hide, even if that’s not the case.

, Not only does this look and feel better, but it also improves your cognitive functions. Be mindful about your breathing and feel aware of your body as you breathe in and out. If you feel yourself getting stressed or overwhelmed, make a point of taking deep breaths until you feel yourself calming down.


As you may know from yoga, breathing in and out, and focusing on your breathing, helps you be in touch with your body and can make you a more centered person. This is a must if you want to be graceful.

, Having strong flexibility is part of having control over your body. You should make time for daily stretches so that you feel relaxed and not too tight throughout your day. This is especially important before you work out, or if you’re sitting at a desk all day and need to relax your back and neck a bit. Make time for stretches, even if you’re doing them in front of the TV, and you’ll be surprised by how much more graceful you feel.


Doing yoga can improve your flexibility tremendously. Take a beginner’s class and see what a difference just a few hours a week can make.

, Your clothes don’t define you, but they can help you look more graceful. The most important thing is that you wear clothes that are clean, stylish, and well-fitting, and which give you an elegant and put-together look. Your clothes don’t have to be expensive; instead, they should be tasteful, not too loud or bright, and flattering.


Don't wear clothing that restricts your movement in awkward ways. High heels may look graceful, for example, but they shouldn't be worn for long periods. Baggy over-sized pants give you a weird shuffle that is not very graceful. Always wear clothes that make you feel confident and attractive, and style your hair accordingly.
Make sure that your clothes are free of wrinkles, and check them for stains after you eat.
It’s also not graceful to have a button popping open or to have your shirt halfway untucked, so do a clothes check every few hours.
If you want to go for a more elegant style, a simple black dress can do the trick. Also clothes in subtle colors, such as browns, pale pinks, or grays, can help you look more graceful.
To accessorize, just a pearl necklace, some simple stud earrings, or a silver bracelet can do the trick. You don’t want to overdo it with bulky accessories, which can keep you from looking graceful.

, Not all women like to wear makeup, and if you’re a woman who doesn’t like to do this, then don’t feel the pressure to to change. But if you do wear makeup, you should make sure your makeup is balanced and even and that it doesn’t come off as too dramatic at the wrong times. For example, you can wear bold eyeliner, but then you may not want to have super thick eyeshadow and heavy mascara as well. Just a bit of lipstick, blush, and eyeshadow and you should be good to go.


Make sure that your foundation matches your skin color.
Remember that not enough makeup is always better than too much.
If you wear concealer or blush, make sure that it’s fully blended.

, Keep your head up, your eyes forward, and walk at a natural brisk stride. People who are graceful don’t hunch over or dawdle; they know where they’re going and they’re proud to be going there. If you look at the floor, you’ll look lost or like you’re not confident. Looking straight ahead will also make it more likely that you’ll be making eye contact with people, which will also make you look and feel more confident and graceful.


Of course, if you’re walking next to someone with a slower walking pace, then you should slow your pace down out of respect.

, When you sit, don't flop in a chair. Pull the chair out and sit down carefully. Though you don’t have to look like royalty sitting on a throne, you should avoid slouching and continue to sit with straight posture. Don’t lean back with your legs spread, and sit with your legs together or crossed instead. When you sit down, make sure you do it with care, no matter how tired you are.


If you’re sitting on a bus or a train, try not to take up too much room. Being a space hog isn’t very graceful.

, People who are graceful aren’t often seen blowing up at people, saying things they regret, or hurling furniture through windows. They are composed and don’t let other people get to them and they know when to take a breather if they feel themselves getting angry. They aren’t seen ranting and raving or hurling insults at people, either. They tend to stay calm and to be a bastion of strength when others need them.


That said, graceful people aren’t perfect. If you blow up at someone, you have to give a sincere apology.

, People who are graceful tend to be articulate, to speak at the right volume, and to not speak too fast or too slow. They are clear and direct in their language, have a varied vocabulary, and make their thoughts clear. They also tend to avoid cursing or using too much slang. Though it’s okay to pause sometimes when you’re gathering your thoughts, graceful people don’t tend to stutter or say “uh” or “um” or “like” every other word. They have control over their words and they believe in what they say.


Part of speaking well means thinking before you speak. If you plan what you’re going to say before you say it, then you’ll be more likely not to have to backtrack and to be clear in your words.
In order to speak well, you should also have a mastery of proper grammar. For example, you shouldn’t say “Him and me went to the movies” when it’s really “He and I went to the movies,” and so on.

, Graceful people are poised and confident, both verbally and non-verbally. Learn some good gestures and movements, and use them. You don’t have to be the next Jack Nicholson to take an acting class. You can just use it to learn how to carry yourself with more poise and grace. It can also help you build confidence and learn how to speak in front of an audience, which is something that people with grace naturally excel at.


You’ll also learn how to interact with a wider variety of people, which is also something that graceful people know how to do.
If an acting class isn’t up your alley, you can try taking a dance class or a ballet class. That can help with your poise, coordination, and composure as well.

, People who are graceful are polite. They don’t talk out of turn, they don’t offend people, and they don’t make off-color remarks, especially not in front of people they don’t know super well. They make a point of asking people how they are, of offering their seats to people who are standing, or just generally avoiding any vulgarities or unacceptable behavior. They are also considerate of others and make sure not to ask questions that are too personal or that make people uncomfortable.


Good manners are a big part of being polite, too. You need to not chew with your mouth open, hold doors for people, stand when you’re introduced to a new person, look people in the eye when you talk to them, wait your place in line, and generally show good breeding if you want to be graceful.

, It’s not very graceful to talk about how gorgeous, stylish, or accomplished you are. In fact, graceful people are very modest, and are proud of who they are without feeling the need to broadcast their achievements. You can talk about the things you love to do without making seem like you’re the best at it, and you can mention your hobbies or interests without mentioning your medals, prizes, or world records. Graceful people don’t seek validation from others and don’t need to show off to feel happy and fulfilled.


If you brag a lot, people will be less likely to hang out with you. You should feel grateful for all of the advantages you have in life instead of bragging about everything you’ve accomplished. Sure, you might have done a lot, but there’s no need to broadcast it if you want to handle your good luck and achievements with grace.

, Graceful people are known for their poise. They carry themselves with dignity and make an effort to stand tall, to not stumble around, and to have confidence and purpose in their bearing. People with poise don’t often get lost, get in arguments with people, or lose their sense of focus. If you want to be graceful, then you have to have poise both physically and in your temperament. Having poise means being balanced in all aspects of the word.People who have poise also maintain their poise in difficult situations. They don’t get flustered or fight back to people who are rude, vulgar, or mean.

, Graceful people are always considerate of others. They make an effort to really listen and care for people and to put themselves in their shoes. They often think about how other people are feeling and make an effort to make them feel better and make their days feel easier. They give up their seats to people who are tired. They check on friends who they know are going through a hard time. They don’t go around being loud and disruptive and make sure not to bother people in public. If you want to be graceful, then being considerate is key.


To be considerate, you need to practice empathy and to really think about what another person is thinking and going through. For example, if your friend just got dumped by her longterm boyfriend, then she may not be too thrilled to hear about your hot new date just yet.

, Graceful people are also known for being incredibly respectful to the people around them and they are always thoughtful in their actions. They don’t make offensive comments, they don’t step on other people’s toes, and they respect the privacy of others. They give credit where credit is due and they don’t interrupt people or insult them, to their face or behind their backs. Instead, they make a point of treating other people with the respect that they need and deserve.


People who are respectful don’t interrupt people when they are speaking. They don’t talk on the phone when they’re checking out at a counter. They don’t hog a four-person table at a cafe to themselves, either.

, Graceful people demonstrate tact in their daily interactions. They understand that it’s important to choose their timing and words carefully and know that it’s important to deliver important news in a kind and thoughtful way instead of piling on the insults. They know when to be discreet and when to deliver information in private, and they know that they shouldn’t make thoughtless comments without knowing their audience first. Tact is key when it comes to being graceful.


Tactful people don’t make comments that are likely to embarrass people in public. For example, if your friend just went through a breakup, you might not want to make a comment about it in front of a group of people.

, If you want to be graceful, then you can’t put yourself first all of the time. Graceful people are often selfless and are happy to devote their time to helping others, whether they’re helping a friend finish an essay or volunteering at a soup kitchen on Sundays. You shouldn’t think that your time is so important that you can’t possibly take a few hours out of your week to listen to others, to share your things and time, or to just make the world a little bit better.


When you help people, you should do it out of the goodness of your heart, not because you want something in exchange.

, People who are graceful don’t waste their time stewing or being filled with bitterness and resentment. They learn to forgive people and to move forward, instead of letting anger dominate them. Though you shouldn’t let people walk all over you, you should accept that people make mistakes and that you should forgive them if they are genuinely sorry, within reason. Graceful people make allowances for other people and don’t waste their time getting caught up in petty feuds. Besides, holding a grudge will make you a more bitter, less happy person.


Along with not holding grudges, don’t gossip about the people you less-than-like, either. There’s no sense in spreading bad vibes, and it’ll probably get back to those people and will cause more drama.

, One of the most challenging times to be graceful is when you’re facing criticism. Whether your boss is telling you to improve your negotiation skills or a friend is telling you that you need to stop being late to everything, you should learn to take criticism at face value, and to use it to improve, if it truly is constructive. Don’t be a bad sport or a sore loser, and understand that people won’t always be suffocating you with praise. It’s important to learn to take the bad along with the good and continue being graceful no matter what.


Of course, if people are just criticising you for the sake of being mean, then you should ignore it. But when people are truly trying to help you, you should be receptive to it so you can improve as a person.

, Research shows that consumers are more likely to use a gym membership if the gym is close to their home or work. Choose three gyms that aren't far from your home or work.

, Discuss what specials the gym currently has, including end of year specials, holiday specials, and summer specials.

, Most gyms offer a free trial of at least one week, and you shouldn't sign any contracts with a gym that doesn't allow you to try out the equipment and services before making a decision.

, If you're new to working out at a gym, you may need a trainer to help you learn the machines. Having a quick workout with one of the trainers will help you figure out which machines you can use alone and also give you an idea of how the trainers work.

, It doesn't hurt to mention that you're currently shopping around, as it can help you negotiate pricing, or the membership representative may offer you a special they had yet to mention.

, You need to fully understand all of the fees associated with the gym, including sign up fees, monthly membership fees and cancellation fees. You also need to find out if special classes cost extra.

, What happens if you become ill or injured and can't workout for a few months? Will the gym extend your membership in the case of an emergency? What are the penalties for early cancellation, or is that even allowed? Does the membership transfer if you move to another state or city?

, Make a list of the pros and cons for each gym, keeping in mind the amount of money you'll need to pay each month, regardless of whether or not you're using the facility.

Consider buying wall mirrors.",How to Build a Low Cost Home Gym," Particularly for cardio and general fitness, a lot can be accomplished with little financial investment. The web is full of useful guides to full, high-intensity cardio workouts which require no equipment. Yoga and pilates are two disciplines which practice exercise using next to no equipment., One item that's accrued tremendous popularity in the past several years is the versatile foam roller. Basic, quality foam rollers can be found starting from $10. If you're looking for the even more cost-effective route, buy a length of PVC pipe at the hardware store and wrap it in a beach towel for a DIY foam roller., Whether to help your back or to change things up, you may be wanting to move past crunches and planks when exercising your abdominal muscles. An ab wheel is a simple, one-step solution to this problem. A common item, you should be able to find one for less than $20.

, These balls are the most versatile items in all of fitness. They are excellent for abdominal work as they support the spine and isolate the stomach muscles. A stability ball works the abs more than a crunch or sit-up could ever do. These balls are highly versatile. The ball may even take the place of a bench in some exercises., Ideally this will be a stationary bike. Good quality stationary bikes can usually be found for only a couple of hundred dollars, whereas an equal quality treadmill might go well into the thousands. Stationary bikes are also adjustable, so you won't have to worry (as you would with an elliptical) about finding one that fits your body.


Keep an eye out for gyms going out of business. Usually they'll offload their equipment to the public, and there's usually no cheaper way of buying quality equipment.

, If you can only go big on one item, have this be it. An adjustable bench will replace the need for an incline bench, a flat bench, and a decline bench. One adjustable bench will save you hundreds of dollars compared to buying all three single benches. An adjustable bench is highly versatile and can be used in almost any exercise., Dumbbells have long been hailed as the better choice among strength training equipment. They are much smaller than large home gym machines and much cheaper. If you could only buy one thing to go towards strength training, this should be it. Dumbbells/free weights will always form the foundation of any budget home gym.If you are already quite strong you should get the standard Olympic dumbbells, which weigh about 12lb (unloaded) and can be loaded with up to 200lbs each.

, If you happen to have spare construction materials this is a great way to make use of them. You'll also need an old duffel bag or exercise bags; fill either with sand or gravel and tape the opening up well. These can be used for any number of exercises which call for weight resistance., The simplest and lowest cost of strength equipment, you can switch dumbbells for resistance bands in any exercise that uses them. Find a place to anchor one side of the band and you can emulate any standing machine to work out whatever your other equipment has left lacking.

, A bit of a DIY endeavor, building a pull sled is a cost-effective way of building leg strength and general physicality. The most basic recipe calls for simply a tow rope and a large tire; attach one to the other and you're good to go. Other more involved plans will usually involve some welding.

, Usually they can be found for no more than $15 to $20. Make sure you have a sturdy door frame in your home on which to use it. Try to buy one that doubles as a bar to do tricep lifts and push-ups; having one of these bars makes it much easier on your wrists when doing push-ups.

, If you can afford it, this big purchase will bring your strength training up a level. Bumper plates are more durable compared to ordinary plates as they're rubber coated and allow to be dropped on the floor. Barbells allow mini increments in weight used from 100GMS-1KG. This is highly useful for the higher level lifters who are plateauing., While not a consideration for the budget, do your best to have your home gym in a place of little disturbance. This will aid tremendously in committing to your exercise by cutting down on distractions, encouraging you to focus on the task at hand. Regardless of how much you spend, don't spend it on stuff you'll end up not using. Having a special place for it all gives a proper home and makes it less likely to be labelled ""clutter."", Unless your home gym is floored with carpet, you should seriously consider buying some padded flooring, if only for a corner of the room. Necessary for yoga and other stretches, padded flooring is an advantage for all exercises. It will make most exercise much more comfortable by reducing the wear and tear faced by your knees and other joints.

, Take a cue from professional gyms and allow yourself a bit of distraction while working out. A television is doubly useful if you are a fan of exercise videos to follow along with. Music can also be an effective stimulant for your work-out; there have been studies linking music with the appropriate rhythm to longer-lasting work outs., More than just a cosmetic touch, having a mirror to watch yourself exercise is helpful in troubleshooting any problems of form. Since you'll most often be exercising alone in your home gym, you won't have a partner to advise on your technique.


Don't let looking good in the mirror drive your exercises, however. Be sure to target more than just the ""show"" muscles.

Find a sturdy wall or tree.,
Get into a plank position facing away from the wall.,
Walk your feet up the wall.,
Push off the wall into a handstand.,
Now start facing the wall.",How to Do a Handstand2," In some cases it's easier to start learning a handstand against a wall or another sort of prop. If you're a bit leery of being upside down, or you're afraid you're going to take a tumble, this is a good way to learn a handstand at your own pace.


Another plus to this method is that you don't need a spotter. You can learn to do a handstand all by yourself.
You'll be putting your feet on the prop, so find one that you don't mind getting a bit dirty, or do the handstand in socks.


, In other words, make like you're going to do a push up right next to the wall by starting on your stomach and lifting yourself up with your hands. You should be close enough to the wall that your feet are touching it.


Your body should be parallel to the wall and your legs should form a 90 degree angle with your upper body., Start moving your feet up the wall with your toes. At the same time, ""walk"" toward the wall with your hands. As you get closer to the wall, your body should become more vertical. Stop when your hands are about 12 inches (30.5 cm) from the wall. You are now doing a wall-assisted handstand!


Keep your body in a straight line and your shoulders tucked in, as if you were shrugging.
Your head should be directly centered between your shoulders; don't lean it too far backward.

, Use one of your feet to gently release your body from the wall so that your weight is completely balanced over your hands. Your body should now be in a straight, vertical line, ending with pointed toes.


Move your hands if you need to correct your balance. Remember to keep your weight between the palms and first knuckles on your hands, and correct by moving the weight toward your fingers.
Bend your legs and move away from the wall when you're finished.


, Now that you're used to being upside down and you've gotten a feel for how to do a handstand, it's time to change the way you start. Instead of gently walking yourself up the wall, you'll face the wall to start. When you learn how to do a handstand by facing the wall, you'll be able to do it anywhere, anytime.


Stand facing the wall with your feet shoulder-width apart.
Step forward, tilt over, and plant your hands about 12 inches (30.5 cm) from the wall.
Keeping your arms straight, lift your legs over your head in one fluid motion.
Don't kick up to hard because it might hurt your heels on impact.
Keep your shoulders tucked in and your head straight. Keep your legs straight and point your toes.
Be sure your weight is centered between your palms and the first knuckles on your hands. Adjust as necessary to keep your balance.
When you're ready to stop, roll out of your handstand.

"
"
Do a Handstand Split.,
Walk on Your Hands.,
Work up to a Handstand Push Up.,
Do a Front Limber.",How to Do a Handstand3," This is an elegant way to finish your handstand. Instead of landing with a normal rollout, you'll move into the splits on the ground.

, Once you've mastered the handstand and you feel confident that you can balance well, try walking around! Do this often enough and your arm muscles will become very strong.

, After those muscles have bulked up a bit, try pushing up into your handstand from the ground.

, If you're an aspiring gymnast, the front limber is the logical next step after you've gotten the hang of standing on your hands.

To be sure you’re really interested in becoming a group fitness instructor, it’s a good idea to try several different types of classes to make sure it’s something that really interests you. Pay attention to what the instructors do in these classes and ask yourself if you could do the same thing.Try a variety of classes such as mind-body, aquatic, bodyweight training, strength training, and dance fitness.
Try classes that use a variety of different types of equipment.
Pay attention to what the instructor does and says in the class, specifically notice the things you like and dislike about the instructor. Take away ideas on how you could either use similar techniques or thoughts on what techniques are not working well.
A general group fitness instructor may end up teaching a wide variety of classes, so it’s important to understand you may need to be flexible and diversify your teaching skills.;
, Going down a new career path is always easier if you have someone helping to guide you. A mentor is a great asset to have as you work your way to becoming a certified group fitness instructor. Your mentor can be anyone who is already in the industry, but you should look specifically for someone who teaches the type of fitness classes you’re interested in.There is no step-by-step plan to finding a mentor. You may have to attend several classes and speak to several instructors before you find someone who you really admire.
Don’t just learn from your mentor, learn from your mentor’s students. Attend your mentor’s classes and speak to the students about what makes a great instructor.

, Most employers will expect group fitness instructor candidates to have a certification. There are currently 5 different organizations which certify group fitness instructors in the United States. Each organization offers different benefits and has different downsides. You need to research all of them to determine which certification will work best for you.Information about the American Council on Exercise (ACE) can be found here — https://www.acefitness.org/fitness-certifications/group-fitness-certification/comparison.aspx.
Information about the National Exercise Trainers Association (NETA) can be found here — http://www.netafit.org/certifications/group-exercise.php.
Information about the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) can be found here — http://certification.acsm.org/acsm-certified-group-exercise-instructor.
Information about the Aerobics and Fitness Association of American (AFAA) can be found here — http://www.afaa.com/courses/group-ex.
Information about the American Fitness Professionals and Associates (AFPA) can be found here - http://store.afpafitness.com/group-fitness-instructor-certification-1/.
If there is a specific employer you’d like to work for, it may be a good idea to contact them to determine which certification they prefer for group fitness instructors.

, Once you’ve decided which certification you want to pursue, you’ll need to register for the program. The easiest way to register is via each organization’s website. Each organization offers different deals and bundles that may combine your study material costs and your exam fee into one payment, but you are not required to do this., Unless you decide to enroll in a course or workshop, studying for the certification exam is done at your own pace. Some certification organizations require that the exam is completed within a certain time period after you have enrolled, so check your registration to determine if you have a time limit.Some organizations offer in-class or online workshops or courses in addition to study materials and the certification exam.

, Some certification organizations may either provide practice exams as part of a package or offer practice exams for sale at an additional cost. Practice exams are normally exams from previous years that you can use to test your own knowledge at home. In order not to be surprised during the actual exam, it is always a good idea to complete one or more practice exam in advance., Use the certifications online booking website to select a day, time, and location to take your exam. Be sure to read all the details about what you can and can’t bring to the test, and any other important logistics for test day.Some organizations require that you have your CPR certification before the exam and you will be required to present that certification before you begin.
Some organizations will allow you to take the test at home and then submit it online for marking.

, Some certification exams will consist of both a written and a practical component, other may only include a written component. If your certification includes a practical component, you’ll be required to demonstrate specific exercises. The written component consists of specific questions that you answer either on paper or via computer.Most organizations require that you attend the certification exam in-person at an exam location. However, some organizations may allow you to complete the exam at home and submit your results on your own.
All of the certification organizations require a certain minimum mark in order to obtain your certification. If you were not able to achieve the minimum mark, they will usually allow you to write the test, at least, one more time, but there will be a cost involved.

, Most, if not all, employers will require group fitness instructors to have a CPR and AED certification before they can teach. These certifications are available through the Red Cross. You can find a location near you using the Red Cross’ website and sign-up for the appropriate course online.The Red Cross’ website can be accessed here — http://www.redcross.org/take-a-class/cpr.
The Red Cross offers classroom-only courses and blended online/classroom courses.
The certification usually combines adult and pediatric first aid, CPR, and AED into one course.
You will need this certification before you can work, and in some cases before you can take the exam, therefore it’s a good idea to work towards this certification while you’re studying for your group fitness instructor certification.
This certification is good for two years, so you will need to renew it if you continue to teach after two years.

, Once you’ve become certified, it’s time to look for a job as a group fitness instructor. Start your search by determining where you want to work geographically. Then start searching for specific gyms, organizations, and jobs within that geographical location.Be sure to include organizations like hospitals, wellness department, universities, community centres, country clubs, cruise ships, and even corporations in your job search. All of these organizations employ group fitness instructors on some level.
Research whether the certification program you went through has any tools or resources to help you find a job. Some of these programs offer their graduates guaranteed interviews for some positions.

, The music played during a group fitness classes is fully the responsibility of the instructor. It needs to be set to the right beat for the movements being performed, and it needs to transition to a different tempo when required.Copyright infringement is important to remember when preparing your music playlist. You can only use music you’ve personally purchased. You cannot share music with other people.
You will need to review the music you want to use for foul language and discriminatory comments. Depending on where you work, these items may not be allowed as part of your playlist.

, Some potential employers will want to see you in action before they’ll hire you as a group fitness instructor. It’s a good idea to be ready for this by preparing a specific routine that you can have ready-to-go if and when you get a call for an interview.This demonstration won’t have to be as long as a normal class, it’s usually closer to 5 to 20 minutes in length.

, As a group fitness instructor, you can also work for yourself and offer classes where you’re able to find space — you don’t necessarily have to own a gym. Keep in mind that starting your own business is challenging and has a lot of additional legal requirements you need to complete before you can start working.You may want to consider consulting a lawyer to ensure you have all the proper documentation needed to start your own business, including insurance.

, As a new group fitness instructor, possibly with your own business, you may need to spend some extra time getting yourself known in your community and with potential clients. One of the best ways to bring in new clients is through word of mouth, so encourage your existing clients, friends, family, etc., to spread the word that you’re an awesome instructor.Great marketing tools include: personalized websites (that are well maintained), social media pages (that are frequently updated), flyers and posters, business cards, and newsletters.
You may also want to consider offering free classes for new clients in order to encourage them to give you a try. If they have a great time, they’re likely to come back AND talk about you to their friends.

, The fitness industry is constantly changing. New equipment, exercises, diets, programs, plans — you name it — are constantly being introduced. New research into human health and nutrition is always being published. As a group fitness instructor you should stay as up-to-date as possible with things happening in the industry.Some great ways to stay up-to-date include: subscribing to industry newsletters and journals, attending continuing education seminars and workshops, attending new classes offered by other instructors, etc.

, As a group fitness instructor, you’ll need to be re-certified every 2 years. Re-certification usually requires a certain number of hours of continuing education units (CEUs) within that two-year span. Only some courses and activities will count towards your CEUs.Refer to your certification organization’s website to determine which courses or workshops qualify as CEUs for your specific certification.
Don’t avoid a workshop or course just because it doesn’t count towards a CEU, any new information you can learn about the industry is still important.
Note that some workshops and courses may require the support of a gym or fitness centre before you’re able to attend. This simply means you need to be currently employed to take the workshop or course.

, Once you become an instructor don’t stop attending other classes. Attending other group fitness classes will not only give you some great ideas for your own classes, it may allow you to try out specific programs you aren’t familiar with. Plus, it can help you build a great network of fellow group fitness instructor to which you can stay in contact and share industry information., While you can certainly improve your group fitness instructing skills on your own, it is always a good idea to ask a variety of other people what they think. Students might be able to provide you with ideas on what’s working well and what they don’t like. Mentors and supervisors may be able to point out areas they’d like to see you improve upon. And other group instructors may be able to provide you with tips and ideas on how to demonstrate a specific move in a way you hadn’t thought about before., Your group instructor certification should just be the first step in your fitness career. This initial certification teaches you the basics and will allow you to teach a variety of fitness classes. But if there’s a specific type of program you’re really interested in (e.g. yoga, pilates, etc.) you may need to work towards additional certifications.Ask other group instructors where they obtained their additional certifications and if they would recommend that route.
Ask your employer what additional certifications they respect and encourage.
Use the internet to search for other group instructor certifications available in the United States.

Don't bring devices with you that you don't need for your workout. If you have a fitness app or want to listen to music, you can still shut off notifications.;
, If you have to adjust your clothing every few seconds, you'll end up spending more time messing with your clothes than exercising. Even when you're not actually adjusting your clothes, you'll be thinking about it, which destroys your concentration.When you buy new workout clothes, go into the store to buy them in person so you can try them on. Move around in the fitting room to make sure the clothing will move with you.
Keep in mind that you're not going to get the best workout if you're constantly worrying about whether you're exposing yourself as you go through your routine.
Untied shoelaces can not only be a distraction, but also a safety hazard. Tie your shoes in a double-knot before you start your workout to keep them secure.
If you have long hair, pull it back before your workout so it's not falling in your face and you have full visibility.

, If the gym is packed, you won't be making the best use of your time – particularly if you have to wait for a free machine or compete for floor space. If you can, try to go to the gym in the middle of the day when there are fewer people.A crowded gym also can be distracting because there are so many people for you to watch, or potentially engage in conversation.
One key to being more productive at the gym is to keep your chit-chat with other gym patrons to an absolute minimum.
If going to the gym in the middle of the day isn't an option for you, consider going to a different location that's less busy.
Even if it takes you a little longer to get to the gym in the morning, you'll make up for that time in not having to wait for machines.

, Your gym probably has plenty of water fountains. However, if you have to stop your routine to walk over to the fountain and get water, then walk back, you're wasting precious time and killing your productivity.Buy a large water bottle that you can refill, and freeze it or fill it full of ice cubes before you go to the gym so your water will be refreshingly cool.
Try to stick to plain water without flavoring or other additives, and avoid sports drinks. Water is your best choice to keep your body hydrated as you go through your routine.
Hydration is important if you want your workout to be effective and you want to make the best use of your time at the gym.

, Music is a great way to focus and motivate yourself as you go through your workout routine. Plan a specific playlist ahead of time that is full of upbeat songs that you enjoy listening to and that drive you forward.Once you've set your exercise plan, you can create a playlist that's timed to follow your routine.
For example, you may pick more down-tempo songs for your warm up and cool down, or faster electronic music with driving beats that will set the pace for cardio.
Various fitness and sports equipment companies have playlists you can download that are specifically designed for particular types of workouts.
If you feel overwhelmed by the prospect of creating a playlist on your own from scratch, these ready-made playlists can be beneficial. If they include songs you don't like, you can tweak them to suit your own needs.

, If you want to make the best use of your time at the gym, you need to walk in the door already knowing exactly what you're going to do and when you're going to do it. Design a routine and set goals for each session as well as longer-term goals that will keep you focused.The goals you set will depend on the reasons you're working out in the first place. For example, if you're just exercising to maintain your basic fitness level, your goals will be different than if you're trying to lose weight.
Start out small, and don't try to take on too much at once. If you over-exert yourself, you could end up with an injury that results in you having to start all over again.
Break your ultimate goal into small, reachable steps that will encourage you to keep striving towards your goal.
For example, if your goal is to lose 40 pounds, you may want to set yourself a goal of two pounds per week.

, If you're working out alone, do your best to actually work out alone – not surrounded by other people, who can distract you and cause you to lose focus. If your gym has an exercise classroom that isn't being used, you may be able to move your equipment there.For example, if you're doing a stretching routine, or floor exercises that only require resistance bands or hand weights, move to a private, more isolated part of the gym if at all possible.
Moving away from other people allows you to focus exclusively on your own exercises and your form, rather than being distracted by what other people or doing or wondering if other people are looking at you.
If you're using an elliptical or a treadmill that can't be moved, you don't really have a choice in who surrounds you. However, using headphones and facing forward can help you focus and avoid distractions.
Keep in mind the reason you're going to the gym. You came there to exercise and focus on your own physical fitness – not to socialize or to watch other people working out.

, If you have a smart phone, there are many different fitness apps from which you can choose. Most are free, while others cost a small amount up front or may require you to purchase a subscription for monitoring services.You can find fitness apps that will monitor your heart and breathing rate, as well suggest exercises to benefit you in various ways.
If you're interested in using an app, check out what's available and decide what functions you need.
Using a more expansive app with extensive monitoring functions on a free trial may be a good option if you're not sure how many of those functions you'll actually use on a regular basis.
Keep in mind that any fitness app you use is only as good as what you put into it. If you're not going to use the app – or if you find the app itself distracting – it's not worth your investment.

, Rather than focusing on one muscle group at a time, exercises that give you a whole body workout are a better use of your time at the gym – particularly if that time is limited.Many exercise machines are designed to work multiple muscle groups. For example, rowing machines engage your arms and shoulders, legs, and core muscles.
If you're working out more than one muscle group, your form becomes even more important if you want to avoid strain or overexertion.
When using machines, make sure you're using the machine correctly and only for the purpose for which it was intended. Avoid getting creative and using the machine for exercises it wasn't designed for, such as doing leg lifts with a knee brace bar.
Consider getting an expert to review your stance and movement and make sure you're doing the exercises correctly.

, If you continue to do the same exercises over and over, not only will you get in a rut, but those exercises will lose their effectiveness over time. Using hand and ankle weights or resistance bands helps you avoid a plateau.For example, if you've been doing leg lifts for several weeks, strapping on ankle weights adds resistance and improves the effectiveness of the exercise. This way you'll continue to build strength in your legs.
If you're doing cardio on a treadmill, try increasing the angle so that you're running or walking slightly uphill to increase the resistance.
You can make similar adjustments to an exercise bike or elliptical machine to simulate an uphill workout and increase resistance.
Adding resistance is about making the exercise more difficult, which forces your body to work harder. This builds muscle and burns more calories.
Many people are reluctant to add weights to their workout because they don't want to bulk up. However, simply adding resistance is not going to give you large, bulky muscles.

, You may not be able to afford to work out with a personal trainer on a daily or even weekly basis. But getting the advice of a certified fitness professional at least once every month or two can enable you to get the most out of your workout.The personal trainer should watch you go through your entire routine. They can then help you troubleshoot your workout and pinpoint exercises that maybe aren't working for you anymore to achieve the goals you've set.
A personal trainer also can suggest different exercises or routines that will help you increase the productivity of your workout and get the most out of your time at the gym.
Your gym may offer a limited number of free sessions with a personal trainer. If it does, make sure you take advantage of this offer – it's included in the price you're paying for a gym membership.

, You don't want to go out for a four-course meal right before you hit the gym, but you also don't want to work out on a completely empty stomach. Give your body the fuel it needs to increase your productivity and reach your fitness goals faster.Typically you want to leave at least two hours between the time that you eat a good-sized meal and the time that you go to the gym.
A half hour or so before you start exercise, have a light snack such as a piece of fruit or a protein bar.
Focus on pre-workout snacks that will give you energy but don't have complex ingredients that take a long time for your body to break down and digest.

, Many people neglect recovery time when they plan their fitness routines. However, adequate recovery time between workouts is essential if you want to get the most out of your exercises, and sleep is an important element in proper recovery.Too little sleep can result in mental and physical fatigue, and can put you at higher risk for injury.
Doctors and fitness experts recommend you get 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night. However, keep in mind the quality of that sleep is just as important – if not more important – than the total amount of sleep you get.
Many people believe they get more out of sleep if they go to bed at a decent hour and sleep several hours before midnight, waking up in the early morning close to daybreak.

Put the weight on the bar.,
To press the maximum weight, expand your chest to the maximum.,
While you are pumping up your chest, also think about technique and psyche yourself for the heavy lift.,
Unpack the weight off the rack and bring it towards your chest when you do this inhale as you lower the weight towards you.,
Exhale strongly with your throat constricted to maintain the air in your lungs as you push the weight away from you.,
Keep a lot of your breath to lift the bar beyond the initial explosion off the chest, pulling the weight up with your traps, to lockout, and to rack the bar.

,
Use a different technique when doing repetition lifting.,
Apply this sample bench press routine for yourself.",How to Breathe Correctly While Bench Pressing," Lay down flat on the bench. Put the bar into your hands.;
, The muscles for bench pressing have the best leverage with your chest fully expanded.


Do a general warm up to expand your chest naturally. Keep the warm up period short but have some intensity.
Expand your chest further with deep breathing. Push the air down to your abdomen. Pump up your chest and abdomen with each breath like you were pumping up a bike tire that requires 100 pounds of pressure. As you keep pumping the tire, it will get harder and harder to pump air into it and this is how it would be with inflating your chest.
When your chest is very expanded, your arms will be at your sides and slightly raised, your posture will be ramrod straight and your chest held high - no other position will be comfortable. You must look like a proud weightlifter - not to show-off but because this is the position of strength.

,


Initial explosion of the bar off your chest: 1)keep your forearms vertical, 2)use your lats, 3)tense and chalk your hands before gripping the bar, 4)place the bar exactly on your palms, 5)gather your strength before the lift, 6)lower the bar slowly, 7)don't bounce the bar on your chest, and 8)keep inflating your chest.
Mid lift mental preparation do this: bring your elbows out and pull the bar up with your shoulders and traps.
Lockout: 1)push and keep pushing, 2)straighten your arms, and 3)don't lose the bar with the horizontal movement.

, The inhale here is with your chest fully expanded and here take a few more quick gulps of air to expand your chest a tiny bit more

, Do not fully exhale - you will lose your strength. Exploding the heavy barbell off your chest will not be spectacular because the bar will not be moving fast to a spectator.

,, The breathing method just explained is for doing singles or doubles.

, This is a late cycle routine that incorporates deep breathing, in the beginning or middle part of a cycle forced, deep breathing is optional.


Do 10 minutes of warm up.
Set 1 - barbell with two big plates for five repetitions.
Set 2 - add weight and do a single. Start slow, deep breathing after this set and think about correct form. With each set, increase the volume of air in your chest.
Set 3 - add weight and do another single. Continue the slow, deep breathing and the complete exhale. Start breathing deeper and into the abdomen. Keep thinking about proper form and explosive power.
Set 4 - add weight and do another single. This single would have begun to feel very heavy and you must start breathing deeper. Stand and pace back and forth to keep warm. Breath even deeper and your exhale will be so controlled there may be a rasping sound from your throat. Continue thinking about the correct form and summon up your nerves for the explosive start.
Set 5 - add weight and do the final set. Exhale a bit when pressing the weight up, explosively at the start, and continue to exhale a bit more as the bar is at mid-range and finally at lockout.
Racking the weight - after completing the final single, take a few, quick gulps of air and then rack the weight.

However, gyms do have the obligation to pay taxes to the federal government, which means, like many other businesses, that gyms should have an EIN. EINs are only used for tax administration purposes by the IRSand don't qualify the holder to open a gym in and of themselves.


Applying for an EIN is quite easy. The application can be filled out online, and, upon completion, the applicant will immediately receive his or her EIN.;
, As with most types of businesses, it's necessary to obtain the proper licensing in order to operate your gym legally. However, this process is somewhat complex because different states can have different requirements for which specific licenses are needed to own and operate a gym. Luckily, this information is available online via the Small Business Administration's Licenses and Permits resource.As an example of the type of certification you may need to open your gym, in California, a gym can potentially require applying for state and local business licenses.
One advantage of opening a gym as compared to other forms of business (such as ones that sell alcohol or firearms) is that no federal business licenses are necessary., Every business must register to pay taxes. As noted above, every gym can expect to register for federal taxes with an EIN. The tax situation at the state and local level depends upon the location of your gym, however, and can vary based on state and local tax law. Consult your state and local tax agencies for specific tax registration information.


For example, in California, businesses (including gyms) can be required to register for one or more state-level tax identification numbers, unemployment insurance tax (if the business has employees), state income tax withholding, and more.

, Like most other businesses, gyms are required to register the name of their business in order to operate legally. As with tax registration, the precise process here can vary from locality to locality. In situations where the gym is a sole proprietorship, registering a name may not be necessary if the official name of the business can be the same as the gym's owner.


For example, in California, small businesses are required to register their official ""Doing Business As"" (DBA) name with the county clerk's office in the county where the gym will operate.

, One thing that gyms have to worry about that certain other businesses do not is the possibility that someone using the gym may be injured or even die on-site. Because high-intensity exercise occurs near-constantly during business hours, injury is always a possibility even if extensive safety precautions are taken. Thus, it is a wise idea for gyms to carry liability insurance (depending on state and local laws, this an even be a requirement to operate the gym.


Most gyms wisely include a clause in members' contracts preventing them from suing in the event of self-caused injury.

, Many large gyms offer play areas or daycares where young children can be left while their parents work out. Though this is not necessary to run a successful gym, if you do plan to offer this service, you'll almost certainly need to apply for a special daycare or childcare license in addition to the normal business licenses you'll need to run your business. The process for applying for a daycare license can differ from state to state.


For example, in California, you need a childcare license if you intend to care for children from more than one family who are not related to you., As with other types of small businesses, a significant portion of a gym's success has to do with its location. The location of the gym should be based largely on the population group that it targets. People don't like having to go far out of the way to fulfill their fitness needs. The best gym locations are in areas where there is demand for a gym, where the gym can be easily accessed by its clientele, and in which competition with other gyms, fitness clubs, etc., is minimal or at least manageable. Below are just a few things you may want to consider when choosing a location for your gym:


Rent. Unless you own your gym's building outright, you'll have to pay rent as one of your gym's operating expenses. Rent can vary from location to location. In wealthy or densely-populated areas, for instance, rent can be very expensive, which can require you to raise membership prices to pay for it.
Proximity to population centers. If your gym is too far away from your clientele, they won't go to it. Good gym locations should be in or near populated areas or at the very least be easily-accessible via car, bus, train, and so on.
Local market conditions. Finally, the best gym locations are where there is a demand for a gym that isn't being filled. Opening a gym across the street from an established gym can be a risky move - why deal with the intense competition when you can open a gym in a part of town that is sorely lacking one?

, Make phone calls or conduct door-to-door surveys to determine not only the age and sex of individuals in the area you wish to target, but also the physical activity level of these residents., Like any business, opening a gym costs some money. Obtaining the space for your gym, buying equipment, modifying your building to accommodate the needs of your gym, hiring personnel, and registration/licensing fees can all be substantial cost barriers to open your gym. Most small business owners don't have the money up-front to pay for everything they need to open their business. In these cases, it's necessary to raise the money somehow — this is usually done by persuading wealthy investors to provide capital or simply by getting a loan.


By some estimates, it can cost anywhere from $200,000 to $500,000, at bare minimum, to open a gym in a place like New York City.For a state of the art gym that features amenities and experienced personnel, the estimates can easily exceed $1 million.
See: How to Find Investors for a Small Business and How to Get a Loan.
Note that in both of these situations you will almost always be expected to provide a detailed business plan for the benefit of the people or entities providing you with the money to open your business. This business plan must offer a convincing explanation for how the business can quickly become profitable, or the investors/lenders are unlikely to provide money for your venture.

, One potentially lucrative option prospective gym owners have is to open a franchise gym, rather than their own independently-operated gym. In this situation, the owner runs the gym for a large chain with many other locations. The parent company usually covers the initial cost of opening the gym and either provides its own equipment or pays for equipment. However, in a franchise situation, most of the profits from the gym go to the parent company. The franchise location may also be subject to sales quotas.The parent company also offers its extensive resources to the gym owner, which can include a recognizable, established brand, training opportunities, connections, and financial support during ""rough times"".
As with traditional forms of small business financing, franchise opportunities usually require you to submit a detailed business plan to the parent company.
Be sure to carefully research the pros and cons of a franchise agreement before committing to it. Owning a franchise may sound appealing, but it's usually not a golden ticket when it's all said and done.

, The best gyms offer a wide variety of exercise opportunities to their clientele. These exercise opportunities should cater to the naturally varying interests of the people who use the gym. One fun, relatively easy-to-provide type of exercise is sports. Many popular types of sports can be relatively cheap to offer and maintain. For instance, all that's needed for basketball is several regulation-size hoops, which can be placed indoors, outdoors, or both. Below are several types of sports you may want to offer at your gym (and the space and equipment required for each). Note that many gyms offer only a few of these sports, or none at all:


Basketball: Regulation-sized hoops and court (can be indoor or outdoor; usually includes regulation floor markings)
Soccer: Goals, regulation-sized field with regulation markings.
Running: Track; usually includes starting marks and/or distance markers
Baseball: Diamond/field or batting cages.
Boxing/sparring: Indoor ring or gym, punching bags, gloves, and masks.
Swimming: Indoor or outdoor pool. Olympic-sized is ideal but other sizes common.

, Members of your gym with serious fitness goals will often want to develop muscles, strength, and flexibility. This almost always refers to performing strength building exercises with ""free weights"" — dumbbells, barbells, kettlebells, and other resistance training tools. Nearly every serious gym will have at least one area of the gym dedicated to housing a wide array of free weights to members. Below are just a few of the types of free weights most serious gyms will offer:


Bench presses
Squat racks
Deadlift mats
Bicep curl racks
Pullup/dip racks
Racks of dumbbells with benches for upper body exercises

, Most modern gyms offer isolation machines (sometimes called ""Nautilus"" machines after the brand name of a popular supplier) in addition to free weights. These machines allow members to exercise one muscle or group of muscles at a time by using the machine to lift adjustable amounts of weights. Though isolation machines can vary in their usefulness in terms of actual strength-building potential, casual gym members generally enjoy these machines because they make it easy to safely perform weight-lifting exercises. Some types of isolation machines found in most gyms are:


Leg press machines
Lat pulldown machines
Tricep extension machines
Leg extension machines
Chest fly machines
Shoulder press machines

, Today, most gyms are expected to offer multiple options when it comes to cardio. A wide variety of stationary machines allow members to perform cardio exercise without actually moving around the gym. It's not uncommon for large gyms to have ""cardio rooms"" packed with dozens of machines. Often, these cardio rooms contain electric fans and television sets to keep members comfortable and entertained while they exercise. Just a few of the types of cardio machines that many gyms offer are:


Stationary bikes
Elliptical trainers
Treadmills
Stair machines
Rowing machines

, For some gym members, part of the benefit of going to a gym (as opposed to exercising at home) is the social aspect. For these people, exercising in the company of others can be more satisfying and rewarding than exercising alone. To cater to this type of clientele, you may want to offer group exercise classes or programs at your gym. These classes can require you to set aside some of the space in your gym and to hire qualified teachers, but you can offset these costs by charging fees for enrolling in these classes. Below are just a few types of fitness classes you may want to offer at your gym:


Swimming lessons
Martial arts classes
Cycling groups
Sports camps
Yoga
Pilates
Zumba (or other rhythmic, dance-based exercise opportunities)

, The first employees a member usually comes across when walking into a gym are the greeters or front desk staff. These employees are the ""face"" of your gym, offering a clean, professional ""front"" and a friendly, welcoming initial interaction to your members. However, these employees are also responsible for loss prevention, ensuring that only registered, paying members enter the gym. In modern gyms, this is usually accomplished by scanning ID cards that are issued to each member upon registration.


Since greeters and front-desk staff are relatively low-skill positions, they make perfect jobs for low-wage workers, like young students, part-time workers, community volunteers, and so on.

, Some gym members are willing to pay for the services of a qualified, experienced trainer to help them reach their fitness goals. These trainers are usually expected to guide their clients in dedicated one-on-one exercise sessions or small group activities. Trainers are also generally expected to provide clients with detailed plans for achieving their goals outside of the gym in the form of diets, activity schedules, and more.


The qualifications that gyms look for in a physical trainer vary. Nearly all physical trainers are expected to be athletic and fit themselves and to possess a good knowledge of anatomy and healthy exercise practices. An academic background in health or biology may be required. Good physical trainers are also friendly, open, and personable with a wide variety of clients.
Personal trainers can obtain certification from a variety of private agencies. However, the standards used by these agencies can vary greatly in terms of strictness. Some major fitness chains don't require their trainers to be certified by one of these private agencies., If your gym offers exercise classes (like yoga, Zumba, swimming lessons, etc.), you will need qualified people to teach these classes. These people can be members of your training staff or outside employees. Regardless of whether you hire from inside or outside your existing staff, you'll want to ensure you choose well-qualified individuals who have both the experience necessary to teach their class well and the ability to effectively manage large groups of people.


Zumba and other brand-name exercise classes can require their teachers to receive certification from the company that produces and markets the exercise materials.Usually, the certification process is relatively simple and requires brief coursework, a simple test, and a certification fee.

, Like any brick and mortar business, gyms require cleaning and maintenance to ensure that the location remains functional, presentable, and safe. However, due to the nature of the activities that take place at a gym, the maintenance requirement may be higher than those of another business of a similar size.

To ensure your gym runs smoothly, you'll need to hire janitors, groundskeepers, and other low-level maintenance staff. You may also want to subcontract your janitorial work to a janitorial company to eliminate the hassle of hiring dedicated staff.

Think like an entrepreneur.",How to Become a Personal Trainer," Personal trainers are responsible for educating their clients on physical fitness and self-motivation. In order to be effective, personal trainers must demonstrate that they have mastered these areas in their own lives. As you consider becoming a personal trainer, ask yourself these questions:


Are you in optimal physical shape? Clients look up to their personal trainers as examples of what it means to be fit and healthy. Even great educators and motivators may have trouble finding clients if they don’t seem to be in shape. This does not mean meeting status quo standards of physical beauty; every body type is different, and being “in shape” means different things for different people. But personal trainers must be able to demonstrate a range of exercises and train just as hard, or harder, than their clients in order to help them succeed.
Do you believe in the power of fitness? Personal trainers don’t just exercise because they want to stay slim. They see physical fitness as a powerful force that fundamentally enhances people’s lives. It is this strong belief in their work that enables personal trainers to be so motivating to others.;
, The best personal trainers have a deep understanding of the way the human body works. It’s a big responsibility: advising clients to perform exercises unsuitable to their abilities can lead to injuries, sometimes severe ones. Clients also work with machinery and weight equipment that could injure them if it’s used improperly. Personal trainers learn much of what they need to know in the courses they take to receive certification, but it’s important to have an interest in working with people’s individual bodies and needs to figure out how to help them get as fit as possible while staying safe.

, Personal trainers must be inspiring, trustworthy, caring leaders. After all, they lead clients through exercise sessions that can evoke pain, frustration and sometimes tears. Personal trainers keep clients’ eyes on their goals and share in the satisfaction and happiness that comes when they’re achieved.

, To truly understand the personal trainer/client relationship, hire a trainer to help you achieve your own fitness goals. Note how your relationship with that person develops, and what traits make him or her effective at the job. Every personal trainer has a different style: some operate like boot camp instructors and others take a gentle, intimate approach. Think about what approach you would take if you were the one helping other people on their path to fitness. See Part 3 plus Tips and Warnings below for more about defining your approach to working as a personal trainer.

, Most fitness centers and gyms require their personal trainers to have certification from an organization accredited by the National Commission of Certifying Agencies (NCCA). The organizations that provide certification each concentrate in slightly different areas. Conduct research to decide which certification program seems right for you. There are also state diploma schools, which will give you hands-on experience and classroom education. An example of a personal training school is the National Personal Training Institute.


Most programs will require you to be at least 18 years of age, have CPR and AED certifications, and pass an exam before administering certification.
Look at programs provided by the National Academy of Sports Medicine, the American Academy of Exercise, the National Federation of Professional Trainers, and the Aerobics and Fitness Association of America for examples of different approaches you could take.
Plan on spending $400-800 dollars on completing the program including materials. Many certifications have self-study online options which can save you money.

, Personal training is a competitive business, and one way to help yourself stand out is by choosing a specialty and receiving additional certification. For example, you may want to find a program that teaches you how to work with children or people with special needs so you can broaden your client base.

, As you pursue your certification, think about what type of job environment would be the best fit for you. Gain experience in your field by working in different gyms in roles that don’t require certification.


Many gyms hire people without certification as “floor trainers.” Floor trainers can get experience as a trainer and find a gym that’s a good fit before begin building a personal list of clients.
Some gyms actually pay for their trainers to receive certification as an incentive for continuing to work there. Call your favorite gyms to find out if they offer this type of program.

, Look at job listings in your area, or better yet, pick up the phone and call gyms. If you’re already a member of a gym, let the administration know that you’re interested in working as a personal trainer.


Most trainers start their careers working for gyms, even if they know they want to branch off on their own later. Gyms provide the credibility you need when you’re first starting out. They also give you the chance to learn from other personal trainers and get practice working with a steady stream of new clients.
The flip side of working for a gym, as opposed to having your own business, is that the gym takes a significant portion of the money you earn. However, good gyms understand the value of keeping great personal trainers and provide benefits accordingly.

, Many gyms attract new clients by offering free first sessions with personal trainers. Use these sessions to keep clients interested in your specific skills and style. Personal trainers’ pay is commission-based, so the more clients you have, the better.


Keep in mind that the gym may require you to sign a non-compete agreement to prevent you from taking clients if you decide to leave.

, With your own business, you’ll be able to set your own rate and keep all the money you earn. You’ll also get to pick the clients you work with.


Research How to Start a Small Business and follow the regulations in your state. Make sure you understand all the complexities of running a business, such as the ins and outs of insurance, payroll and taxes.
Some personal trainers hold sessions in their homes, where they have a room set up with the proper equipment. This could be a convenient choice, but it’s important to make sure the setting looks professional if you want to attract clients.
Other personal trainers rent a studio, which they sometimes share with other personal trainers. This could be a more attractive choice if you have a large client list.

, Once you start your own business, you’ll have to attract your own clients - you won’t have a gym to do it for you. Get familiar with marketing basics and spread the word about your business.


Choose a catchy, professional-sounding name to attract new clients.
Set up a Facebook page and a Twitter account. Post pictures of your studio, and, with their permission, your happy clients.
Consider advertising in your local newspaper.
Hold events and offer specials to help spread the word when you’re first starting out.

Choose a lightweight t-shirt or sweatshirt.,
Pick your bottoms.,
Bring appropriate footwear.",How to Dress for the Gym1," Wear a breathable material like cotton or polyester. When you work out, you'll grow hot and sweaty, so you want to make sure that your clothing doesn't trap the heat. If possible, choose a top that is specifically designed for wicking sweat. Consider wearing a tank top or sports bra for a more breathable—if more revealing—outfit.If you have large breasts, then a sports bra may be essential for a comfortable gym experience. No matter your size, a bit of extra support never hurts.;
, Wear something flexible, with an elastic waistband: gym shorts, sweatpants, track pants, or yoga pants. You should be able to perform a full range of leg workouts while you're wearing the bottoms. The bottoms that you wear also depend on the effect that you're going for: tight and skin-showing clothing can help you show off, and baggier, more flowing garments might help you blend in.Short shorts may afford you the most flexibility, but they can also show a lot of skin. If you feel shy in shorts: wear sweats or yoga pants.

, The shoes you wear will depend upon the sort of exercises that you're doing. If you plan to do any cardio, then bring shoes that will offer plenty of protection for your feet and legs.


If you'll be running on a treadmill, then make sure to bring running shoes. If you will be using an elliptical or exercise bike, then your footwear doesn't matter so much – just wear something comfortable that you can stand in.
If you'll be training weights, make sure to wear something with ample ankle and arch support. Running shoes are always a good choice.

Wear headphones--even if you don’t like to workout to music.,
Dress for success.,
Get the “eye of the tiger” during your workout.,
Make it clear that you are here to work out if you bump into someone who wants to chat.",How to Avoid Being Chatted up at the Gym," It’s far more difficult to be open to a conversation if you are listening to music and “in the zone” than easy to access without the headphones.


Act like you don’t know someone is trying to talk to you. Either look down or find a focal point that is away from where someone could get into your social space. Even if you can tell someone is talking to you peripherally act like you don't know he/she is trying to get your attention and all.
Crank up the volume. While most likely not the healthiest idea (since consistent, loud music can lead to hearing loss), but can be used as a last resort from time to time, turning up the volume so there’s no way you can hear anyone can help throw up a barrier.
Quickly remove one earphone and act like you can receive an “emergency” message such as “where is the bathroom” or “hey, you are bleeding” if someone is desperately trying to get your attention. Once you’ve answered that one question, stuff the ear bud back in your ear the minute the question is resolved.;
, Often the more attractively, provocatively dressed gym rats get hit on and talked to most, so if you wear indiscriminate clothing that shout, “I’m here only to work out,” hopefully you’ll be safe.


Avoid bold colors. Even wearing tight pants and tops in all black can make you a target. Instead, find an old, muted t-shirt (without your college letters or a saying that could start a conversation) and relatively baggy shorts or sweat pants to help you to blend into the background.
Don’t accentuate your hot features. If you have a nice butt, don't wear butt-enhancing shorts. Cleavage should definitely be covered and men should always keep their shirt on.

, If you are bored and looking around the room, the gym talkers will smell your boredom like a group of vampires at a blood bank. Even if you are bored out of your mind, cultivate that look of extreme focus that people won’t want to mess with or most importantly drum up a conversation.


Don’t smile. This will make you look approachable and open opportunities for gym talkers to approach and talk to you.
Never make eye contact with anyone. If you act like you are super focused on your workout, you won’t be looking into anyone else’s eyes. Make eye contact with the wrong person and you could be trapped in conversation.
Allow for the occasional grunt. No one really wants to talk to the person with the tennis scream or grunt so allow yourself to fully express that you feel the burn during your workout.

, If you get caught the idea is to make the conversation short and simple without being totally rude.


Be friendly if it’s a friend. Even though you want to avoid getting into the conversation, there’s no point in ruining a friendship because you don't want to talk at the gym.
Tell your friend that you are in the middle of an awful workout and that you need to concentrate so you can avoid getting hurt. Take a few minutes to exchange pleasantries and then ask your friend if you can meet up for coffee or juice after the gym.
Make sure you end the exchange by scheduling time together later and then replacing your headphones and resuming your workout. Go directly back into your workout and regain your focus.

Read and memorize the gym rules.,
Wipe down the equipment that you used when you are done.,
Get to it.,
Do not bring your cell phone there with you.,
Try to keep the 'sound effects' to a minimum.,
When you're done using the weights, put them back in the proper place.,
Avoid hogging machines.,
Do not walk between others exercising and the mirror.,
Put on antiperspirant before arriving at the gym.,
If you see someone that looks like they might need a spotter, be ready to step in and do it for them.,
Pay attention to where your personal space is.,
Do the lift properly.,
Finally but importantly, take care if you're trying to seek a date with someone at the gym.",How to Have Good Gym Etiquette," Most well run gyms have clear rules about usage of equipment, space, and etiquette. Knowing these will ensure that you do not inconvenience anyone else and it gives you the ammunition needed if someone else using the gym breaches them and inconveniences you. While there's no need to make a big deal out them, they are there for the sake of safety and an improved user experience, so be aware of their content.;
, Towards that end, carry a towel or some paper towels with you. Even if you don't think you're sweating, there are still those 'icky' cells you would be sharing. In addition, we shed skin flakes, hair and other parts of ourselves, so it is best to leave it clean.

, Do not slow down your exercising by talking with your friends during your workout. When you talk to others, there is a tendency to move slower and to dally over the equipment rather than focusing on the exercise. Talk with your friends, or exercise. At least, this should be the etiquette shown when the gym is busy or crowded.


Since gym isn't about chats, take any catch-up chats with others to the cafe. Most gyms either have one or have one nearby. If not, just find an area away from the equipment to have a chat.

, You are there to exercise - not chat or conduct business. Many people go to the gym to switch off and forget about work or chores. Keep your cell phone in the locker.


If you are expecting an urgent call, take it outside so as not to disturb others and to maintain your own privacy during the call.

, Grunting with exertion is acceptable, but yelling with every rep is unnecessary and can be quite disconcerting to others, especially if it is continuous. If you are trying to get the attention, wear some nice clothes and take it to the dance floor.

, This holds even if you found them in the wrong place to begin with. Two wrongs do not make a right. Not only is it rude, but it is dangerous.


Don't drop the weights. You are harming the machines, the floor, and the weights. If you have to drop them, then maybe their weight is too much for you just yet. This is not a 'dead weight' competition. Remember––feet and toes are not immune to being crushed.

, Keep moving. You do not need to be on any one machine for over 10 minutes, some perhaps 20-30 maximum. If you think you do, square it with the gym operators first, to ensure that you are not creating a bottleneck.


Consider the potential for damage you can do to yourself when you overdo use of the equipment. This is about your health as well as etiquette.
If it is not busy and nobody is waiting for the machine, some extra time is likely to be permissible.
In turn, be patient when waiting for others to finish. This will undo any good the workout is doing you, as well as being poor etiquette. Wait for a break in the other person's exercising first, and then ask politely if they can indicate their finish time and leave it at that. Most etiquette observing gym goers will get the message; if not, you can always ask for help from the gym's management.
Do not hog the water fountain too long either. Get your drink quickly and move along.

, Many gym exercisers are using the mirror to try to watch their form and they will not appreciate the distraction.

, If you have a problem with body odour, it will make the environment more pleasant for everyone. It does not matter what your age, physique or gender, a little deodorant goes a long way in maintaining good interpersonal relations at the gym. However, do not go to the opposite extreme and overdo the perfume or cologne, as that can be just as offensive to others' sense of smell.


A t-shirt mops up more sweat than a tank top or singlet.
Ensure that any clothes you wear are not too scanty or allow glimpses of private areas when you move.

, It is a great opportunity to make friendships with those with common interests. In turn, they can do it for you, including timing you, motivating you and helping you with suggestions.

, It is not very pleasant getting smacked with swinging arms from someone else who is exercising (incorrectly). Backing into people, sticking sweaty armpits into others' faces and treading on feet are all things you need to avoid doing. Be aware of being a considerate space user at the gym; mark out the invisible boundaries before you go ahead and exercise.

, You look much dumber doing a lift improperly than using lower weight and having correct technique. Top offenders:


Not hitting your chest on bench press
Swinging your back into a curl (it's for biceps, not your back)
Lat pull down should be to your chest, not to your spine
Going beyond parallel on forward or lateral dumbbell raises

, Be tactful and avoid asking out every person who seems like a possibility––that's offensive! Remember that most people are actually at the gym to exercise first and foremost.

Realize no one is looking at you.,
Remind yourself that working out is a learning process.,
Refrain from comparing yourself to everyone else.,
Do what makes you comfortable.,
Wear clothes that make you feel confident.,
Start off slow.",How to Be Confident at the Gym when You Are Overweight1," One of the scariest things about going to the gym when you’re overweight or not as fit as you’d like is having other people look at you. However, no one is really going to be looking at you when you are at the gym. Most people at the gym feel the same way you do - they are worried people are looking at them. When you go into the gym, feel confident that just as you are focusing only on your workout, others are doing the same thing.Being self-conscious in the gym is very common. Many people who work out feel like they are overweight, not doing the exercise correctly, or comparing themselves to people they think are more fit than they are. Understanding that you are not the only one who may be uncomfortable may help you start to feel more comfortable.
If someone does look at you like you don’t belong or says something rude, they are being disrespectful and rude. No matter if you are overweight or ripped, you have as much right as everyone else to go to the gym and strive for a healthier lifestyle.;
, Making major lifestyle changes like eating healthy and exercising regularly are learning process. No one is born knowing how to do the exercises they are doing. Try to remind yourself of this the next time you feel uncomfortable at the gym.


Everyone in the gm had to learn at one point. It is usually a bit intimidating to learn something new, but this uncomfortable feeling of everything being new is a part of the learning curve you are on.
Even the most advanced gym-goers are learning new things and learning about how to push their limits with something new.

, One of the worst traps you can get into at the gym is comparing yourself to everyone else. Going to the gym should be a completely self-absorbed activity, where you only worry about yourself. Most of the people at the gym are strangers, and what they think doesn’t matter anyway. Every time you go into the gym and complete a workout, you are one more step towards your goal.Of course you will inevitably look around at the people working out. Remember that everyone else started somewhere different from where they are.
Instead of looking at the fit people, look for the “normal” people. Gyms are full of all sorts of people, including overweight people, older people, and people who are unfit and never exercised in their life. Remember, you are not alone.

, There is not one way for you to exercise at the gym and get fit. If you feel uncomfortable in the exercise machines because you don’t fit in them, skip the exercise machines. Free weights offer better exercise than machines according to most fitness experts. Choose only exercises that make you feel good.Just remember not to slack off or not push yourself. Find movements you enjoy and make you want to push yourself.

, Some people treat the gym like a fashion show. However, you need to wear clothes that make you feel comfortable and confident. You can buy yourself a new pair of shorts, new sneakers, or a new shirt to make you feel better, or you can wear clothes that always make you feel good about yourself.You may not feel comfortable wearing tank tops or spandex, and you don’t have to. Instead, wear a t-shirt and some basketball shorts or a loose-fitting tank and tights.
Shirts with motivational or workout-related slogans are becoming more popular. Buy yourself a motivational shirt so that every time you look in the mirror you will feel inspired to work harder.

, It’s okay that you are not the fittest person at the gym. You are at the gym working on a healthier lifestyle. When you try new things, start off slow. You don’t have to lift as much or go as fast as anyone else. You want to work on your form and increase your strength and endurance slowly. It isn’t a race or a competition.Going too fast or trying to lift too much at first can lead to injury.
Remember, no one started off lifting tons of weight or running fast. Everyone worked up to the level they are.

Watch how many calories you consume a day.,
Be sure you always have a breakfast with enough protein and carbohydrates in it, as this is your source of energy for the day!

,
Have healthy snacks.,
Keep yourself hydrated.,
Do not avoid eating fruits or vegetables.",How to Be a Healthy Girl2," Limit yourself according to your weight.

,, Healthy snacks are recommended if you get hungry during the day. Avoid fatty, salty, or sugary foods and stick with fresh, revitalizing foods that are healthy and delicious!

, It is recommended you include at least eight glasses of water a day in your diet, plus two glasses of milk and some juice. Since a considerable amount of your body is made up of water, you'll need to replenish any lost moisture from sweating.

, Not only are they just as important as eating other foods, but they contain some of the water that you need! They also ensure healthy bowel movement and prevent constipation. However, watch how much you have in your diet, for too much is bad!

Follow the old but famous rule: brush your teeth twice a day.,
Take a shower - not a bath - every day.,
Refrain from using products that contain chemicals, especially in shampoos and conditioners, as your scalp is the most absorbent part of your body.,
Avoid using hair straighteners, curling irons, etc.,
To ensure that you smell good, use a deodorant that makes you smell fresh.,
Don't forget to care for your face.",How to Be a Healthy Girl3," Be sure you have a clean toothbrush with effective bristles (replace it every few months). You must also be sure that you use enough toothpaste. Flossing is also important, as toothbrush bristles will not reach all the particles of food stuck in between your teeth! For a fresh breath and stronger teeth, use a good mouthwash that contains no chemicals or artificial flavors.

, Use enough soap and be sure you wash every part of your body. Don't forget to wash your hair at least three times a week, but avoid washing it every day, as it will wear it out!

, Those chemicals will travel down into your bloodstream, which will hurt you in the long run!

, and anything that applies extreme heat to your hair. It will cause split hands, a loss of shine and color, and it hurts your hair a lot! Let your hair dry naturally and try to use methods that avoid heat to your hair (ex: use rags to curl your hair instead of a curling wand).

, Avoid using perfume, as this can form a stink cloud around you - no matter how good the perfume smells at first.

, Use an excellent, effective cleanser, toner, and moisturizer. Use lukewarm water to rinse your face - avoid extremely hot or cold water. Pat your face - don't rub - gently using a clean towel and avoid popping any pimples.

Wear shorts or sweats.,
Take a breathable, flexible shirt.,
Go shirtless, depending on the gym.,
Choose appropriate footwear.",How to Dress for the Gym2," Make sure that your bottoms give you a full range of motion. Be conscious of how much you will sweat during your workout, and think about how hot you're going to get.


Try not to wear shorts that extend more than an inch below your knees – especially if they are loose around the legs. The lower your shorts, the shorter your range of motion., A cotton t-shirt or tank will suffice. Alternately, choose a breathable, sweat-wicking polyester shirt. Pick something that will absorb sweat and that won't restrict your range of motion.A tank will show off your arms, and a t-shirt can be a slightly more modest choice. Decide what you're going for., This can be the most comfortable, most breathable solution. Make sure to read the vibe of the gym before you strip down. There are usually no rules against male shirtlessness – but you may stand out more if you're working out at a smaller gym or if you are the only one shirtless.


Some gyms do have a code against going shirtless. Read the rules beforehand!

, The shoes you wear will depend upon the sort of exercises that you're doing. If you plan to do any cardio, then bring shoes that will offer plenty of protection for your feet and legs.


If you'll be running on a treadmill, then make sure to bring running shoes. If you will be using an elliptical or exercise bike, then your footwear doesn't matter so much – just wear something comfortable that you can stand in.

Wear lightweight, breathable socks.,
Consider bringing a weight belt.,
Carry a towel.,
Wash your clothes after the gym.",How to Dress for the Gym3," Cotton socks are generally a good choice. Make sure that the socks are neither too tight nor too loose!


Wear high socks or low socks, to your taste. Short socks will give your legs more space to breathe, but high socks can be useful for wicking away sweat.
Tight socks can constrict your legs and slow your blood circulation. On the other hand, socks that are too loose might distract you by sliding down your legs.

, If you are planning to lift heavy weights, then include a leather waist belt in your wardrobe. This may help you avoid back injuries.

, As you move about the gym, use a soft, clean towel to wipe your sweat away. You don't want to leave your sweat on the seat of a machine! Most gyms provide clean towels for members to use during their workouts. Do not share a towel with anyone, or else you risk sharing germs!Clean up any sweat that you do leave on a machine. Use a small, clean towel to wipe down the seat, the bars, and any other part that your sweat has touched. Your sweat carries bacteria that could infect someone else if left to dry on the machine!, Even your own sweat, when left to dry on fabric, can breed nasty bacteria and then infect you. Odor-making bacteria tend to grow better on polyester than on cotton – but you should wash all gym clothes regardless."

Choose one exercise to focus on.,
Take the hand weights to a different room.,
Set up sessions with the personal trainer.,
Join a group class.,
Develop a workout plan.,
Work out with a friend.",How to Be Confident at the Gym when You Are Overweight2," You don’t have to conquer everything at once. You don’t have to work on every muscle group at the same time. While you want to get a balanced workout, maybe choose one or two exercises to begin with to help you start to get comfortable at the gym. Think about something you may already be familiar with or something you’ve always wanted to learn.For example, you may decide you want to focus on barbell squats. Go into the free weight section and choose your weight. You may only be able to do 35 or 45 pounds, and that is great. Spend a few weeks working on your squat. Hopefully by the end of a couple weeks, you feel more comfortable in the gym and want to try other new exercises.
You may also decide to focus on the treadmill and the shoulder machine, or doing bicep curls and shoulder presses with hand weights.
Don’t worry about the guy next to you who can squat or press hundreds of pounds. You are in the gym, working on your goal. That’s impressive and progress for you.

, If you do not feel confident using the hand weights in the free weight weight, grab what you need and move to a different room. It doesn’t matter if you use the weights in the free weight room or another room. Going to a place you feel more comfortable can give you the confidence to get through the workout.Just remember to return the weights after you are finished.

, If you are unsure where to begin at the gym, you can set up personal training sessions with the gym trainers. During the sessions, you and the trainer will come up with a workout plan tailored to your fitness level and goals. This can help you feel confident that you are using a plan that will get you results.During training sessions, trainers will be there, coaching and encouraging you. They can help you learn difficult moves and motivate you when you want to give up.
Personal training sessions can be expensive, so this may not be an option for everyone.

, Group classes are an excellent way to try new things and work towards your fitness goals. Group classes are given at different times throughout the week and cover a wide variety of exercises. During group classes, you will be exercising alongside other people with an instructor taking you through the routine.


Instructors are generally encouraging during classes or stay at front of the exercise room as they do the workout with you. You won’t have instructors hovering over you or yelling at you if you have to stop and rest or modify the exercise.
A group exercise class is a good way to try a new exercise in a low-stress, inclusive environment.

, When you get to the gym, you should have a workout plan ready. This can help you be more confident. Knowing which machines you want to use, which exercises you want to do, and how many sets and reps you want can help you not feel intimidated or uncomfortable as your workout.Having a plan gives you focus for your workout. You will also have goals, and each time you hit one of your exercise goals, you will feel more confident.

, Bringing a friend to the gym can help you feel more confident. Your friend can provide emotional support and motivation, so that you can work out with more confidence. It is always easier to do something that is intimidating when you are not alone.Make sure your friend has the same goal in mind as you, that way you end up exercising instead of talking.

Familiarize yourself with the gym.,
Introduce yourself to people at the gym.,
Ask for help from the gym trainers.,
Use your headphones.,
Try a specialized gym.,
Workout during slower gym times.",How to Be Confident at the Gym when You Are Overweight3," Many people feel uncomfortable in a gym because they are new to it and feel like they don’t belong. That just means you have to get used to the gym space. After you get your membership, spend some time just walking around. The more familiar you are with a place and the more time you spend in it, the more comfortable you will be there.Start by walking around the cardio machines. Look at the treadmills, stationary bikes, and ellipticals.
Walk around the weight machines. Look at what each one does and which ones you are interested in using.
Go into the free weights room or section. This room can be the scariest for people. Maybe you’re not ready for barbells, but look at the hand weights. Most gyms have them in weights ranging from five or 10 pounds to 50.
Check out the pool, spin room, group exercise room, sauna, and locker room. Continue walking around the gym during your next few visits as you get used to this new and potentially nerve-wracking exercise space.

, Getting to know the people at your gym can help to make you feel more comfortable when you visit. You may also get some encouragement from people who go regularly.


Try starting out by saying “hi” to people you see at the gym often.
After a few times, you might try introducing yourself to break the ice. For example, you can say, “Hi. My name is ____. I am just getting started here. How long have you been a member?”
Over time, you may develop friendships with the people at your gym and gain some extra support as you continue your fitness journey.

, The people who work in the gym are there to help. If you aren’t sure how to do something, ask them to help you. You will gain confidence once you learn how to properly do moves like squats, deadlifts, or presses. You can also ask for help with machines if you don’t know how they work. They are there to help you, so let them!Many gym trainers will take you through machines or the free weight room if you are new to working out. They will help teach you how to properly use the machines or do moves so you can avoid injury.
Many gym memberships come with one free personal training session. These sessions can be a good time for you to ask questions or get a trainer to help you get started on a workout plan tailored to you.

, A good way to be confident in the gym is to listen to your favorite music. Nothing is more motivating than some feel good, pumped-yourself-up tunes. Make a playlist full of songs that make you feel good about yourself and want to move.Headphones are a good way to block out other people if you feel uncomfortable.

, If you are only interested in certain types of exercise, you may consider joining a specialized gym. These gyms only offer classes in a certain area instead of offering a variety of everything. You may feel better and more confident surrounded by people who are interested in the same activity as you.For example, you can join gyms for yoga, barre, spin, kickboxing, or CrossFit.

, If you are not confident at the gym yet, you can go during slower times when the gym isn’t as busy. During these times, there won’t be as many people around you to make you feel less confident. You may be able to work out in nearly empty rooms, meaning you can try things without feeling like people are watching you.Most gyms are busiest in the evenings right after work. During the day and later in the evenings are generally not as busy.

Determine what sort of aerobics you want.,
Set aside enough time to meet exercise recommendations.,
Pre-prepare a workout plan.,
Wear clothes that let you move.,
Prepare a large, clear area.,
Make a good workout playlist.,
Do dynamic stretches before exercising.,
Keep a water bottle handy.As you’re sweating during your workout, your body will begin to dehydrate.",How to Do Aerobics1," Some people are happy putting together their own workout, but more often this involves finding a program that appeals to you. Aerobic classes tend to have a lot of factors to consider when joining one. Some major ones:


Gym or home? Do you prefer going to a gym, or doing workouts at home with a DVD player, YouTube video, or the like?
The type of aerobic genre. There are many types of workouts, including:

Targeted audiences: Aerobics for senior citizens, men, pregnant women, and so on.
Themes: boot camp, martial arts, hip hop dance, Latin salsa, and more.


Instructor. Classes tend to focus around the directions of the leader, (whether in real life or virtual) and if it is not a good match for you, it can ruin the experience. Different aerobics instructors will have different personalities, sensibilities, and demeanors.
High versus low-impact. A more lengthy explanation of the pros and cons are below.
Your current fitness level. If you are in great shape, maybe a very energetic program is for you. But if you are just starting out, you will need a more beginner program.;
, Regardless of your goals — losing weight or just improving overall health — you won't see or feel any change in your body unless you exercise regularly.


The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends that adults get at least 2.5 hours of moderate aerobic exercise (low-impact aerobics) or 75 minutes of strenuous aerobic exercise (high-impact aerobics) per week.So one hour-long low-impact aerobics class per week isn't enough to meet professional standards for a healthy lifestyle. Set aside enough time throughout the week to reach your exercise goals.
Another way to approach your routine is to elevate your heart rate for half an hour every day, taking a day off here and there.If you are trying to lose weight, you should increase the amount of time you dedicate to exercise, as these recommendations are a minimum guideline for healthy living.

, Regardless of what type of aerobics you're doing, you want to make sure you're working out your entire body in a thoughtful manner. Of the five recommended elements of physical activity — aerobic exercise, strength training, core exercise, balance training, and flexibility — aerobics itself is simply one piece of the overall picture.However, with a little bit of pre-planning, you can incorporate steps and tools into your workout plan that help you achieve the recommended balance.


Aerobic exercise: obviously, you want to keep your heart rate elevated throughout. This is why aerobics instructors ask you to march in place in between steps rather than stopping and taking a break. If you can speak easily, you're not working out hard enough.
Strength training: Holding hand weights while performing your aerobics routine will help build muscles in the arm, while adding ankle weights will build leg muscle.
Core strength: Incorporate moves that target the muscles in your abdomen — windmills, for example. The addition of hand weights while performing windmills will result in an even better core workout.
Balance training: Many moves in aerobics require you to shift your weight from one foot to the other. Focus on the slow, deliberate transfer of weight and the balance of your body when doing these steps. Hamstring curls and ski jumps, for example, are a good opportunity to focus on balance.
Flexibility: When performing steps that require stretching, commit all the way to the stretch. Windmills are a great example of an exercise where you may not be able to reach your feet at first due to poor flexibility. With some attention and practice, your flexibility will increase over time.

, Aerobics will lead you through a wide range of motion, so don’t wear stiff clothes that will keep you from moving your arms and legs comfortably. You’ll also sweat a lot, so wear clothes that won’t make you overheat — athletic shorts and a t-shirt will work just fine. Make sure you’re wearing shoes designed for exercise, not flats or work shoes.

, You’ll be swinging your arms, kicking your legs, and moving around while doing your aerobics routine. You don’t want to knock things over, so pull tables and chairs into a corner, clearing a large space where you can move freely without having to worry about breaking something or hurting yourself by running into a table.

, Studies have shown a correlation between a good workout playlist and increased workout efficiency.Because the main point of aerobics is to raise your heart rate, choose only music that has a fast rhythm, so you’ll have to work hard to keep up with the beat. Only choose songs that you like, though! The more you enjoy the music, the more you’ll get into the steps you’re doing, and the better your workout will be. Furthermore, if you enjoy the workout because of the music, you’ll be less likely to get bored and stop working out after a couple of sessions.

, Dynamic stretches are movements that go through a full range of motion as opposed to static stretches that are held for twenty or thirty seconds. There are many different types of dynamic stretches that you can do to warm up.









Arm circles can help increase the range of motion in your shoulders. Hold your arms out straight to form a T. Make small circles with them for ten seconds before reversing the direction of the circle.
Raise your arms in front of you before bringing them straight above your head. Try to bring them down as far back behind you as they will go. Move them back to starting position, and repeat.
Lie down to do hip and knee bends. Bend your knee as you bring it up towards your chest. Slowly straighten it back out again. Repeat with the other leg.

, If you don’t replenish your body with water throughout your workout, you can overexert and hurt yourself, so keep water nearby and drink whenever you get thirsty or need to cool down a little.

Manage your Tabata routine with an app.",How to Do a Tabata Workout," Because Tabata is reliant on quickly repeating simple exercises with full exertion, you should pick those that are relatively easy and comfortable for you to do. And since Tabata moves so fast, you should choose exercises you are confident you can do with correct form so you don't injure yourself. Tabata was developed for use on stationary bicycles, and that is still the ideal way to Tabata. Other possible exercises include:Cardio training exercises like: stationary cycling, using an elliptical, rowing machine, or doing jumping jacks.
Basic training exercises like: squats, pull ups, crunches, push ups, jumps, or sit-ups.;
, After choosing an exercise, you need to complete a set of intervals or repetitions of that exercise. Performing repetitions vigorously and repeatedly is the essence of Tabata.


Put maximum effort and energy into completing your intervals. If you are cycling, begin pedaling as hard and fast as you possibly can.
Each interval will take 20 seconds. Do as many reps as possible. For example, if you are completing jumping jacks, see how many jumping jacks you can do in 20 seconds. Make it your goal to beat your personal record.

, After completing repetitions for 20 seconds, you will rest. Resting is important, as it gives your body time to recover from the strain of vigorous exercise.


End your last repetition in the start pose of the exercise. For instance, if you chose crunches, make sure you stop exercises and start your 10 seconds of rest when you are in the down position., A complete Tabata workout (a circuit) is made up of eight sets. As a result, you'll need to complete all eight (exercising for 20 seconds and resting for 10 during each set) to finish your circuit.As with your original set, make sure to exercise as vigorously as possible throughout the rest of the circuit.
Circuits may be made up of a variety of exercises. For instance, you can pick one exercise, go back and forth between two different ones, or even do eight completely different exercises.
Feel free to walk a few minutes after completing your circuit to cool down.

, Tabata training is a very specific and simple workout that requires you to give 100% of your energy, moving as fast as you can. This lends itself only to certain exercises. If, for instance, you want to incorporate weights into your Tabata workout, then it is no longer technically Tabata — this is because weightlifting requires you to move slower and with caution so you do not injure yourself. Another example is running, which requires time to accelerate and decelerate, which means you are not doing full-out exertion for the full 20 seconds. A combination of high speed and high intensity can easily lead to injury.

There is nothing wrong with doing Tabata-style timing instead of traditional Tabata, but it's important to distinguish between the two. True Tabata training emphasizes total high-intensity work, as Tabata found that intensity was as (or perhaps even more) important as duration of exercise. Doing traditional Tabata with an inappropriate exercise (like resistance training with weights) could lead to serious injury.
By the 6th or 7th interval, your muscles may be exhausted, which puts you at risk of injury if you are doing something like weight lifting or running on a treadmill. You will need to modify your level of intensity or range of motion when doing these exercises, which means it is not true Tabata.
A stationary bike is ideal for Tabata, as there is no ""ramp up"" time as on a treadmill (you would lose 10 to 15 seconds to speed up and slow down a treadmill for your intervals), and because you are seated and stationary, you are unlikely to injure yourself.
Tabata is named after Dr. Izumi Tabata, a Japanese physician and researcher who developed the workout. The athletes who participated his research were on stationary bikes, which allowed them to stop and start quickly.

, After you’ve perfected a basic Tabata workout, you should consider a more advanced workout. By varying your workout, you’ll challenge yourself and get more out of your Tabata experience Tabata should always be a challenge — if it is starting to get easy, then you need to change it up.


Feel free to choose anywhere between two and eight different exercises.
Think about picking exercises that work different muscle groups in different ways. For example, if you choose four different exercises, you might pick: mountain climbers, crunches, burpees, and squats.

, Setting up any equipment before you begin will save you time as you move through your circuit. Consider where in the gym you will need to perform each exercise. For example, group all exercises that require the use of a piece of equipment or exercise mat. Remember, however, to also be considerate of other gym-goers: if you take the only pair of 25 pound dumbbells and then only use them for 20 seconds during your eight minute workout, you might make some enemies. If this is the case, use your 10-second cool down to return the weights so other can use them.


Think about your position as you perform the exercise. For example, group all exercises that require you to stand up (like jumping jacks and pull ups). If your circuit includes situps, pushups, jumping jacks, and squats, make sure you do situps and pushups back-to-back, since you'll be on the floor for both., If you choose to do one type of exercise more than once, you need to decide if you want to do those sets back-to-back or alternate them with different types of exercises. When deciding this, consider:


That completing multiple sets of the same exercise back-to-back may save you time. For instance, if you choose to do two sets of pushups in your circuit, by doing them back-to-back, you won't have to waste time getting in the same position again.
That alternating exercises might be more interesting. For example, you may get bored doing multiple sets of crunches. You may find that it is more fun to instead alternate crunches with pushups, jumping jacks, and squats.
That completing multiple sets of the same exercise might tire you out faster. For instance, if you do two sets of pushups first, you may wear yourself out and be unable to effectively complete two sets of pull ups or lifts later in the circuit., By completing all of your chosen exercises and appropriate number of sets, you’ll finish the circuit and conclude your Tabata workout.


Make sure you complete eight sets. If it helps, write out or print your Tabata schedule so you can see it while completing a circuit. This way, you won't forget or repeat a set.
Stay energized as you begin to wrap up your circuit. While you may be very tired by the 6th or 7th set, remind yourself that you are almost there. Try to view Tabata as a personal challenge that you want to win.
It is okay if your circuit goes over 4 minutes. Over time, you'll be able to finish your circuit more efficiently., Timing and full-exertion are what make make a workout Tabata. You'll need to keep your time while you do reps, sets, and the whole circuit. Without keeping time, you won’t be able to get the most out of Tabata.


Use some sort of app to alert you when to switch sets.
Place a clock prominently so you can see it while you work out.
Use a traditional timer., Tabata should be part of a total comprehensive workout schedule. To do this, tailor your schedule to spread Tabata out and to pair it with other types of exercises.


Start with Tabata once a week. This exercise works your heart up to or near its maximum capacity, and your heart (which is also a muscle) needs to rest and recover or you risk damage.
After four to eight weeks of doing Tabata once weekly, you may want to increase to twice weekly. Any more than that is too much.
Do cardio training on off days. For instance, run, swim, or cycle on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.
Consider doing some weight training on days you do Tabata. For instance, if you’ve designed a Tabata regimen that focuses on your core, plan to do some weight training that works out your upper body., Mobile device apps will help you design routines, plan your week, and provide you with prompts on when to switch exercises during your circuit.


Use the schedule function on apps to design and plan different circuits for each week.
Many apps also have a way to include different types of exercise routines, like running or swimming, into your schedule. This way, you'll have a comprehensive view of your fitness activity for the week.
Try apps designed specifically for Tabata like Tabata Pro or Tabata Trainer or apps designed for interval training like Bit Timer or HIIT Workout Timer."

Calculate your maximum heart rate (HRmax).,
Check your resting heart rate (RHR).,
Calculate your Heart Rate Reserve (HRR).,
Calculate your Target Minimum Heart Rate (Target HRMin).,
Calculate your moderate Target Heart Rate (Target HRMod).,
Calculate your Intense Target Heart Rate (Target HRIntense).,
Check your heart rate during a workout session.,
Base the intensity of your physical activity on your THR.,
Judge how your body responds.",How to Calculate Your Target Heart Rate," Your maximum heart rate is the fastest your heart can go in beats per minute (bpm). To estimate this, multiply your age by 0.7, then subtract the result from 207.This is well beyond what most people reach (or should reach) during exercise, so don't rely on a heart rate monitor for this step.


For example, if you are 39 years old, estimate 207 - (0.7)(39) = 207 - 28 = ~180 bpm HRmax.
There are several similar formulas in use, so you may hear slightly different estimates from your doctor or exercise coach.Avoid estimates based on the outdated ""220 - your age"" formula.You can get a good, quick, and easy estimate with the 220-age formula. Just remember that it is accurate to only +/- 2 or 3 beats per minute.;
, The Karvonen method takes into account your resting heart rate, which varies from person to person, and therefore provides more reliable calculations for each person. Before getting out of bed in the morning, check your pulse by placing the tips of your index and middle finger against your inner wrist, or on your throat to either side of your windpipe.Watch a clock with a second hand and count the number of heart beats in 30 seconds, starting with ""zero"" on the first heartbeat.Multiply the count by 2 to get your resting heart rate in beats per minute.


For greater accuracy, find the average from three different mornings. For example, if you measure 62, 65, and 63 bpm, the average is (62 + 65 + 63) / 3, or about 63 bpm RHR.
Smoking, caffeine, stress, hot weather, hormone fluctuations, and many medications all affect your heart rate. Do your best to minimize these factors before measuring your RHR.

, This is the difference between your heart rate at rest and your heart rate at maximum effort. We call it your ""heart rate reserve:"" the extra intensity your heart has available for when you need it.


To get your HRR, use the equation HRMax - RHR = HRR.
For example, if your maximum heart rate (HRmax) is 180 bpm and your resting heart rate (RHR) is 63 bpm, then your heart rate reserve is 180 - 63 = 117 bpm.

, Multiply your HRR by 0.5. It is not healthy or beneficial to use up your entire heart rate reserve during normal exercise. Instead, you can aim to use a percentage of your reserve based on how strenuously you would like to exercise. Multiply your heart rate reserve by 0.5 to find the minimum increase needed for moderate exercise.


If your heart rate reserve is 117 bpm, using half of this reserve would mean increasing your heart rate by (117) x (0.5) = 58.5 bpm.
Add the result to your resting heart rate for the target minimum heart rate. The answer is the low end of your target heart rate. This is a good target for people who have just started to exercise regularly, or who are recovering from an injury.
Using the numbers above, a resting heart rate of 63 bpm + an increase of 58.5 bpm = 121.5 bpm minimum Target Heart Rate.

, Replace 0.5 with a higher decimal to calculate a higher target heart rate. If you are just starting an exercise program, you may want to gradually increase your target as your fitness improves, up to about 0.7 for the high end of moderate exercise. If you are an athlete choosing a target heart rate for vigorous exercise, you may want to start at 0.7 or higher., Extreme-intensity, anaerobic exercise might use 0.85 of your reserve.To find this number, use the equation: (HRR x 0.85) + RHR = HRIntense.

, In order to do this, you should: stop exercising, not allow yourself to rest before taking your pulse, and immediately resume exercise after ten seconds. Then, multiply the number of beats per 10 seconds (your pulse) by 6 and you'll have your heart rate (beats per 60 seconds, that is beats per minute).


A more accurate way of doing this is by using a heart monitor to get heart rate readings during a workout session., You can determine whether the intensity of your physical activity is low, moderate or high by measuring the workout heart rate (bpm) against your THR. If your heart rate falls into the middle of your THR range or corresponds to your average THR, that means you're exercising at moderate intensity (roughly 50 to 70% of your HRmax). If it verges toward the upper limit, you're exercising at high intensity (70 to 85% of your HRmax).


If you have just started working out, aim for a low to moderate intensity. You can increase it as your body gets used to exercising.Your heart rate should also be in the lower range of your THR when you are warming up or cooling down.
As you exercise, make sure your heart rate never goes beyond your maximum heart rate.

, This formula will give a good estimate for most people, but it's not foolproof. Pay attention to how your body responds when you reach the target heart rate you calculated. Adjust your target heart rate if necessary based on your observations:Moderate exercise (the lower end of your target) should cause mild to moderate sweating and faster breathing. You may have mild muscle aches for a day or two if you are not used to exercise.
Vigorous exercise (the upper end) causes hard breathing — you must pause for breath after a few words.
Stop exercising and seek medical help if you experience breathing problems, chest pain, severe muscle or joint pain, dizziness, extreme sweating, or extreme fatigue. Lower your target heart rate in future.

Understand reasons for choosing low-impact aerobics.,
March in place to warm up.,
Travel forwards and backwards.,
Perform heel digs.Staying in place, extend each leg forward and tap the heel of the foot against the ground, alternating legs to the beat of the music.,
Do step-touches.Take a wide, but comfortable step to the right (don’t lose your balance!,
Do duck walks.Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.,
Do grapevines.Take a comfortably wide step to the left, but when you bring your right foot over to meet it, cross your right foot behind and past your left foot; with your weight on your right foot, bring your left foot over to the left to stand comfortably for a beat before bringing your right in to tap your left foot.,
Perform hamstring curls.Take a comfortably wide step to the right, then lift your left heel behind you, bending at the knee.,
Find a low impact aerobics class.",How to Do Aerobics2," Low-impact aerobics avoid movements that put a lot of pressure on joints, including movements like jumping, running in place, and the like. Low-impact aerobics is designed to minimize the risk of leg injuries, and is recommended for seniors, pregnant women, and overweight people.If you fall into one of those categories or have joint problems you should not attempt high-impact aerobics at all, unless you doctor approves it for you. If you’re out of shape and want to ease your way into a workout regimen, low-impact aerobics is a great way to get your body used to a range of motions before you start pushing yourself.









Low-impact aerobics are not only for people with ""issues"". Many workouts designed for minimizing impact are just as effective as high impact, without as much risk of injury.
Not all ""low-impact aerobics"" are appropriate for everyone. It is not risk-free. A very overweight or out of shape person may still get injured if he or she is working out at too high a level. Using improper form or incorrect movement patterns may also cause injury.
Cycle through a variety of different motions. It doesn’t matter what order you go in, but stay in each motion for at least one or two minutes before moving on to the next motion.
You should repeat the same motions repeatedly throughout your workout. If you are having difficulty with a more advanced move, return to more basic movements, such as stepping back and forth. Once your muscles stop burning, go back to the more difficult motions.

, Don't begin your workout in earnest until you've warmed up your body. In warming up, you gradually increase blood flow throughout your body and loosen up the muscle groups you'll be using, reducing the risk of muscle stress.Use the rhythm of the music you’re playing to guide your steps, but the music should be fairly fast-paced to make sure you’re moving fast enough to get your heart rate up.









Your arms can hang naturally at your sides, or you can swing them in a sharp, but controlled motion to work out your arm muscles as well.
Make sure to lift your knees enough to cause your legs to burn over a period of time. Simply shuffling in place will not make you sweat!
Do this for at least two minutes to warm your body up in preparation for a wider range of more demanding movements.
Get into the music! Clap your hands if you feel like it. The more fun you’re having, the more likely you’ll be to continue exercising.

, Walk forward three steps, swinging your arms energetically at your sides; on the fourth count, tap your foot on the ground and clap your hands. Repeat this motion moving backwards, so you end up where you began. Remember to change which leg you being with.









Repeat motion for as long as you’d like, until you get bored of it and want to move on to a new movement.

, Lift your hands to shoulder or chest level every time you draw a foot back, and fully extend your arms downward with every foot extension. Keep your motions controlled and deliberate to make sure that you’re engaging your muscles instead of letting gravity do all the work for you.








,), then bring your left foot to your right foot and touch the ground with it. Move your left foot back out to your original position, then touch your right foot to the ground by your left foot.









You can combine this with any number of arm movements, from controlled arm swings to shoulder rolls.
A shoulder roll is simply when you pull one shoulder forward slightly, then roll it up and back. Alternate shoulders to the beat of the music, working out your shoulder and back muscles.

, Lower your body into a squat, and start taking small steps forward. Continue walking forward for thirty to sixty seconds. This increases the burn in your thighs. You can pump your arms in a controlled manner at your sides.









It’s important to keep a straight back during this step to prevent back pain.

, Then repeat the process to the right side.









Kick your leg out to the front on the last beat (when you would normally simply tap one foot to the other) to increase your activity rate.
Begin the movement to the left with your arms down, and slowly lift them out to your sides and up over your head in a deliberate, wide motion, with your hands meeting over your head on the fourth beat.
Bring your arms down during your movement to the right so the return to their beginning position.

, Don’t swing your entire leg, just bend your heel back toward your bottom. Bring your foot back down, then repeat the motion on the left side, alternating sides to the rhythm of the music.









You can push your arms forward as though pushing the air away from your chest on the leg curl, then pull your arms back into your chest when you return your foot to the ground.
You can also do bow-and-arrows with your arms: extend one arm out directly to the side and tuck the other into your chest while keeping your elbow pointed out to the side. Alternate sides to match your feet movement. The motion should look a little bit like using a bow and arrow.
To increase the muscle exertion, you can double or triple up on the curls you do on each side before moving on to the other leg. This way, you muscle doesn’t get to relax immediately, and the workout is a little more difficult.

, There are many styles of low impact aerobic exercise, so you should be able to find a class that works for you. Keep an eye out for:









Low impact step aerobics
Low impact Zumba classes: though Zumba, a dance exercise that incorporates Latin and world music, usually involves a good amount of jumping and bouncing that can be stressful on joints, look for a class that offers a low-impact alternative.
Power yoga: power yoga is a more athletic form of yoga that was invented in the United States. It's a rigorous exercise that will increase your heart rate without stressing your joints, but make sure to look for a beginner's class.
A spinning class: these classes involve riding a stationary bike, but are often set to workout music chosen by the class's instructorWater aerobics: these classes take place in a pool. The water's natural buoyancy protects your joints, but also provides greater resistance to your movements, resulting in a safe and vigorous workout."
"
Do high impact aerobics if you have healthy joints and are in shape enough.,
Warm up.,
Do scissor steps.,
Do windmills.This motion is stationary, in that your feet are set, but it’s still a difficult motion and you can lose your balance if you’re not careful.,
Jog in place.,
Do ski jumps.Begin in a position like you do when you’re skiing, with your knees bent, your torso leaned forward slightly, and your hands at your chest with your elbows tucked in.,
Do repeater movements of basic steps.,
Find a high impact aerobics class.",How to Do Aerobics3," Research suggests that when healthy bodies engage in activities that exert force on the joints, it can actually help build and strengthen bone, and of course, more strenuous exercise raises the heart rate more.Again, do not attempt high impact aerobics if you have joint or bone pain, unless your doctor permits it. If you think you’re in good enough shape to jump right into high impact aerobics, this is a great way to get your heart rate pumping harder and shape your muscles more than low impact aerobics.









Just as with low impact aerobics, you will create your own combinations and routines from a range of steps, all performed to high-paced music.

, Warm up just as you would for low-impact aerobics, by marching in place. This is just to get your body ready for physical exertion. Perform dynamic movements with a full range of motion. Start by doing arm, shoulder, leg, ankle and wrist circles. Gradually increase the range of motion by doing knee, neck and back bends. March in place for about two minutes before beginning your combinations.








, This motion calls for you to jump, moving your legs back and forth in a scissoring motion. You can keep your hands on your hips or swing them in a controlled motion at your sides, as you normally would during walking or running, but with a more exaggerated range.









From a standing position, jump so your left foot is forward and your right foot is back.
Jump again, switching the position of your feet.
You should switch foot position for each beat of the song you’re listening to.
Make sure to center your balance. Put your arms out to the side to stabilize yourself if you feel like you’re going to fall.

, Begin with your feet about shoulder-width apart, in the “stride” position. Extend your arms out directly to your sides, making sure they stay parallel to the ground.









Keeping your arms straight through the elbow, reach your right arm down to touch the instep of your left shoe. Do you best not to bend your knees.
Your left arm should swing behind your body, and your face should rotate to look out to the left.
Return to your original position, then repeat on the other side, touching your left hand to your right shoe.
Keep your abs contracted. Make sure that your back straight as flat as possible instead of letting it slump and get rounded.

, Let your arms swing naturally at your side as they would during a normal jogging motion. If you want to make this motion more difficult, bring your knees up higher. Alternate between normal jogging and high-knee jogging to keep your heart rate up without wearing yourself out completely.








,









From your bending position, jump up and to the right side, making sure you jump with both feet at the same time, then land with both feet at the same time. Balance your weight over your heels and sink down into your bent stance again.
The jumping movement should be completely lateral, not forward and back.
As you’re completing the jumping motion with your legs, bring your hands up to the sides of your head as you extend into the jump, then bring them down to your sides, keeping elbows bent, as you land and go back into your bent position.
Jump from left to right, repeating this motion.
To increase the level of difficulty, place an object next to you to jump over. By increasing the required height of the jump, you’ll get a better workout.

, Regardless of which step you’re doing — from hamstring curls to windmills — repeat each motion three times before switching sides. This increases the level of difficulty and makes your muscles burn more quickly, since you don’t get a chance to rest that side of your body immediately after performing a movement.








, There are many styles of high impact aerobic exercise, so you should be able to find one that meets your liking. Some examples of classes to keep an eye out for include:









Step aerobics
Zumba, a dance exercise that incorporates Latin and world musicCrossfit training, a demanding exercise program that cycles you through a wide variety of exercises and stylesCapoeira, a Brazilian martial arts form that incorporates dance and acrobatics set to musicTae Bo, an aerobic exercise form that combines elements of Tae Kwon Do, karate, boxing, and dance.
Call your local gyms and inquire into the high impact aerobic classes they offer.

Make an appointment or talk on the phone to review your exercise plan with your physician.


Getting a medical clearance from your doctor may seem silly or unnecessary. However, your doctor knows you and your health best and will be a great asset when trying to stay active.
Ask your doctor about exercise. Ask whether or not all exercises are safe for you. Can you do higher intensity or high impact exercises? Can you work out for more than 45 or 60 minutes? Do you need to keep your heart below a certain level?
See if your doctor can give you specific information or guidance on exercise. Ask for an exercise plan and how to progress safely over time.;
, One time that you need to be exceptionally careful when exercising is if you're pregnant. Exercise may not only be harmful to you, but also to your growing baby if you're not very careful.


In general, if you were physically active before you got pregnant, that same or a slightly lower intensity version of those exercises will be safe while you're pregnant. In fact, many OB/GYN physicians will tell you to continue with exercise as long as it's comfortable.However, there are some very specific guidelines. Avoid exercise that: has a high risk of falling, has a risk of getting hit in the abdomen, have excessive amounts of jumping or hopping, have twisting movements while standing, or exercises that require intense bursts of activity.
Avoid exercises like: HIIT workouts, strenuous strength training exercises, martial arts or kickboxing, team sports like basketball or soccer, jumping rope or sprinting.
Although exercise can be dangerous while you're pregnant, it still offers a lot of benefits if you're safe. Talk to your OB/GYN for specific guidelines on what you can and cannot do. This will vary from woman to woman.

, There are a variety of heart and cardiac conditions that will require extra care when exercising. Whether you have heart disease, heart failure or suffer from chronic angina, choose exercises that are safe for your condition.


Your heart and cardiovascular system play an essential role when it comes to exercising. Although your body muscles may be working hard, it's your heart muscle that's supporting your entire body when you exercise.Although exercise can eventually strengthen your heart and even help you recover or cope with certain heart conditions, it can also work your heart too hard and cause uncomfortable chest pain or more serious side effects.
Avoid exercises that do not include a warm-up or cool-down, that increase your heart rate above a moderate-intensity, are done for long periods of time or are done in extreme weather conditions (like hot, humid or excessively cold weather).
Avoid exercises like: HIIT workouts and sprinting.

, Another time you need to be very careful with certain exercises is after you've injured yourself. If you don't do the right type or intensity of exercise you can prevent your body from healing and even re-injure yourself.


Whether you've injured your knee, back or neck, you need to be very careful when you restart your normal exercise routine. If you're not, the risk for another injury or a long healing time is high.In general, don't start back with the same exercise where you injured yourself to begin with. For example, if you have runner's knee, don't start back with your long runs again.
Also, don't choose high impact or high intensity exercises. These can cause injury and need adequate time to build up to.
Avoid: HIIT workouts, running or sprinting, step aerobics and more strenuous strength training.

, As you age, there are additional safety concerns you should be aware of when it comes to exercise. Choose activities that will be safe for you and don't have a high injury risk.


As you age, there are additional health factors to take into consideration. For example, you might have weakened muscles, have more difficulty balancing, have decreased range of motion or have health conditions like arthritis that make it more difficult to be active.What exercises you avoid will be based on your current health condition and comfort level. However, it might be a good idea to stay away from higher intensity exercises, high impact exercises, exercises with jarring movements or exercises that require larger range of motion.
It might be wise to avoid: running, jumping rope, aerobics classes, sports and advanced yoga or pilates classes.

, One particular time that you need to avoid potentially hazardous exercises is when you're recovery from a surgery. Be very careful when you're exercising so that you can allow your body to heal fully.


Whether you had a C-section, a spinal surgery or had your gallbladder removed, surgery is a serious situation. Physical activity can prevent healing and even cause injury while you're healing.
Avoid all activity of any type until you get a clearance from your physician. You should also avoid exercise while taking narcotic pain medications or while your sutures or stitches are still healing.Just because you've been cleared for exercise doesn't mean you can go full throttle. Avoid high intensity activities, exercises that have jarring motions or high impact exercises.
Avoid running, sprinting, aerobics classes, yoga, pilates and strength training exercises.

, Regardless of why you need to be careful, it's important to stay as safe as possible. One person that can help guide you in addition to your physician is a personal trainer.


Look for a personal trainer at your local gym. Many times gyms will offer their members a discount or a few free sessions with their membership.
You may also find a trainer that can come to your home or work instead of a local fitness center. These trainers can also provide one on one help.
When you hire a personal trainer, they will take all of your health concerns into consideration and make sure that the workouts they advise you to do are safe for you. If you require more help than a personal trainer can provide, then they will refer you to a physiotherapist or kinesiologist.

, When you are exercising, you need to make sure you're using proper form. This is especially true if you're pregnant, recovering from an injury or recovering from a surgical procedure.


If you don't have correct form, even a simple exercise like a squat can cause injuries.
If you have a personal trainer, make sure you ask them to review correct form on all the exercises you're doing. If you don’t have a personal trainer, then you might consider looking for one in your area.
When you're actually exercising, try to be in front of a mirror to see yourself. This will help you get a better view of your entire body and see if you're in correct form.

, As long as you're feeling OK while you exercise, it's generally safe to continue to do so. However, you should stop exercising if you feel sick, uncomfortable, fatigued, or if something hurts.If you've begun to exercise and you start having pain, it's a good idea to stop and take a break for the day.
This is especially true if you feel any sharp pain, acute or very local pain, or the pain increases the more you continue to exercise.
Also discontinue exercising if you have chest pains, difficulty breathing or tightness in your chest.
With pain or any other symptoms, stop exercising and contact your doctor as soon as you can. Do not restart any activity unless provided with a medical clearance.

, Even if you're participating in a relatively safe exercise, there are some weather conditions that can make any exercise unsafe and hazardous to your health.


During the summer months, take great care when exercising outdoors. If it is excessively hot or humid, then it is best to stay indoors when you exercise or go very early in the morning or late in the evening.On the other end of the spectrum, it is not safe to exercise when it is extremely cold or icy outside. Again, stick to an indoor routine.
Keep track of the weather by watching the news or researching your local forecast online. That way, you know what days will be the safest to exercise outdoors.

, To help you stay safe during your exercise routine, it's recommended to include both a warm-up and a cool-down. This will help get your body ready to start and end exercise.Someone who is at a higher risk for complications or injury during exercise should spend more time warming up and cooling down.


Plan to warm up for about 10 to 15 minutes. Choose a low intensity and low impact activity. Many times, a warm up is a slower version of the exercise you're planning to do.
For example, you might walk at a comfortable pace for 10 to 15 minutes prior to walking at a faster pace for 30 minutes.
A cool-down is similar to the warm-up. It should be done for 10 to 15 minutes and include a progressively slowing exercise and end with stretching.
For example, you might end your walk by slowing down your pace gradually for 10 minutes until you are walking at a slow, casual pace, and then spend five minutes stretching.

, Outside of the negative health effects that exercise can have, it's also important to find a safe time to exercise. It is also important to find ways to keep yourself safe when you are exercising outside.If you usually exercise by yourself, you need to be careful about when and where you exercise.
For example, if you go for a walk by yourself at night, you need to take extra safety precautions, such as wearing brightly colored reflective clothing, bringing your cell phone with you, and planning a safe walking route.
Choose a time of day that other people are also exercising or that someone can go with you.
Also, try not to exercise alone when it's dark - either early morning or at night. Choose a time of day where it's light and areas are well lit.
If you don't feel safe exercising outside, then try walking at a local mall or indoor track.

, Once you figure out what types of exercise aren't going to be hazardous to your health, start working on incorporating the right amount of activity each week. Start with including the correct amount of cardio.


Health professionals recommend that you include at least 150 minutes or about 2 1/2 hours of cardiovascular or aerobic exercises each week.These exercises should be moderate intensity. However, if you're not able to do moderate intensity, stick to lower intensity activity until you're able to advance.
Try exercises like: walking, jogging, water aerobics, cycling, dancing or using the elliptical machine.

, In addition to cardiovascular exercise, it's also important to include a few days of strength training. These exercises will help you build and tone your muscles.Health professionals recommend that you include one or two days of strength training in addition to your aerobic activity.
Choose exercises that will work every major muscle group and aim to do exercises for at least 20 minutes in total.
Again, be careful with what you choose. Only choose strength training activities that will not cause further injury or damage.
Yoga is a great strength training exercise to start with. It can be customized for a variety of issues and it's easier on your body. In addition, you can eventually do weight lifting or bodyweight exercises as well.

, If you're not able to do a lot of the recommended structured activity, don't worry. You can still stay active and reap the benefits of activity by increasing your lifestyle activity.


Studies show that lifestyle activity can have similar benefits to structured aerobic activity.Lifestyle activity are those exercises that are a part of your normal, daily routine. Gardening, household chores, walking and taking the stairs all count as lifestyle activity.
If you're not able to do much physical activity, try increasing how much you move, how much you stand and how many steps you take during the day.

, Nothing is more important to your body's rest and recovery than days off. Make sure to schedule in a few rest days into your exercise routine.


Fitness professionals know that rest days are essential to your overall health. It's during rest that your body will heal itself, recover and do any repair that's needed.
If you start back in with your exercise routine and don't take enough rest days, you can increase your risk of prolonged recovery and have a higher injury rate.In general, most people need about one or two rest days a week. However, if you're recovering from an injury, surgery, are pregnant or have other health issues, you may need three rest days a week.
Talk to your doctor to see what's most appropriate for you. Also listen to your body. If you're feeling tired or overly sore, it's probably time for a rest day.

, Wear something cooling and that allows you to move without being too tight.

,, You should be able to fly through this workout within an hour or less, so be sure you plan accordingly.

, One of the most important parts of the workout is to do some stretches before you dive in. Consider doing some runner’s lunges, light squats, hamstring stretches and quad stretches.

, Rather than having to muddle through, trying to figure out technique, perform a few of the moves from your workout ahead of time. Do the moves slowly and deliberately so you get the form down correctly.

, Air squats are a plyometric exercise where you squat down low and then spring up into the air. You will perform 50 of these squats consecutively without breaking in between.

, A burpee is when you jump down from a standing position into a push-up, pull your knees to your chest and then spring up to a standing position. For a more advanced move instead of just standing up, jump up and then go right into your next rep.

,


Lay flat on your back in the sit up/crunch position.
Bring the soles of your feet together and allow your knees to fall to each side (so you look like a butterfly).
Bring your clasped hands between your knees.
Raise up into a crunch/sit up position while your hands move forward toward your feet and then release the position.

Slightly arch your back and reach upward with your arms.
Go back into plank and perform your next push-up rep.

, A Russian twist is essentially a backwards lunge where you twist your torso in the opposite direction as your back leg. You can perform this move with or without weights.

, These challenging lunges require you to drop down into a prisoner surrender with your arms far above your head. Get into a squat position and then drop one knee down, drop the other knee down, then stand up one leg at a time still in the squat position.

, Take small sips of water (do not gulp) during the workout to remain hydrated and aware.

, Don’t jerk your limbs or be overly aggressive with stretching. Instead, be sure you gently stretch out the muscle groups you just worked.

, Sitting around in your own sweat encourages viral growth and can leave you susceptible to getting sick. Also, sitting around in your sweat may encourage acne and skin infections.

, To help heal muscle tissue after this workout, have a very small meal (250 calories or less) that includes protein such as almonds, eggs, cottage cheese, beans or lean meat.

Learn the basic classifications.,
Note the differences in purpose.,
Note the differences in design.,
Note the differences in seating positions.,
Note the differences of the paddles.",How to Tell the Difference Between a Kayak and Canoe," Canoes and kayaks are classified by letters and numbers. The letter refers to the type of boat being used, and the number refers to the number of paddlers in the boat. While there are various kinds of canoes and kayaks for different water activities, water conditions, and skill levels, the boat classifications generally stick to a common letter and number system. For example, a typical canoe with one paddler would be defined as C1 (solo). A canoe with two paddlers would be defined as C2 (tandem).While typical canoes have an open deck (meaning the top of the boat, and consequently the inside of the boat, is open to the elements) some canoes used in competitions or harsher water conditions can have a closed cockpit, therefore altering the classifications.


In this example, a typical canoe could be classified as OC1 whereas the closed cockpit canoe could be classified as C1.A solo kayak would be signified by K1, whereas a tandem kayak would be K2, and K4 would signify a four-person crew.;
, In the recreational boating world, canoes tend to be the “pickup truck” whereas kayaks are tend to be more like a “sports car” metaphorically speaking.Canoes are considered practical, versatile, and easily manageable. These features make canoes great for leisure paddling with family on relatively calm water.Kayaks on the other hand normally carry less people, and they can usually travel faster than canoes which is why they are favored for competitive and challenging water conditions., As mentioned earlier, typical canoes normally have an open deck, whereas kayaks normally have a closed deck. The differences in the two decks are essentially obvious: open decks expose the top and inside of the boat to the world, while closed decks cover the top and inside of the boat. Accordingly, a canoe with an open deck gives the paddler/s the opportunity to move freely, whereas a kayak with a closed deck surrounds the paddler/s and provides protection and secure seating.For rougher water like sea kayaking or white water (class 3 and above), the enclosed deck combined with a spray skirt is significantly beneficial. A spray skirt is a covering material that surrounds the paddlers to help keep water out from the inside of the boat., Paddlers in a canoe normally sit one of two ways: sitting or kneeling. When sitting, the canoe paddler sits on a seat and places their knees against the top edge and rim of the boat. When kneeling, the canoe paddler positions themselves closer to the front of the seating, and wedges their knees against the sides of the boat for stability. Paddlers in kayaks usually sit lower to the hull (bottom) of the boat in a cockpit, and have their legs stretched forward inside the kayak, with their knees resting on supportive thigh braces.

, In a canoe, the paddler typically uses a single-blade paddle.Kayak paddlers usually use double bladed paddles. Because kayak paddlers are generally seated lower than canoe paddlers (with their seated position just above the waterline as opposed to sitting way above the waterline in a canoe), a single paddle doesn’t provide efficient propelling.


Some advantages to using a double bladed paddle are its easy to learn technique, and its quicker pace.Some advantages to using a single blade paddle are energy conservation, and minimizing zigzagging in the water."

Allow the hair to grow.,
Choose a razor blade.,
Apply a shaving gel.,
Shave in the direction your hair grows in.You maximize your ability to catch hairs in your razor if you shave along with the grain.,
Treat razor burn.Razor burn occurs if you try to shave too closely.,
Tend your legs with an electric shaver.,
Consider switching to a root removal method.",How to Deal with Thick Leg Hair1," If you want to deal with hair growth on your legs, allowing your hair to grow actually makes surface hair removal treatments more effective. Because the hair strands will be longer, there will be more for a shaver or razor to latch onto.


It's a good idea to shave at night rather than during the day. Shaving at night will leave your legs feeling smoother.;
, Shaving hair is arguably the most common way of removing leg hair. While it may not take hair out at the roots like waxing, it's relatively easy and pain-free to do. Purchase a quality razor from the health section at your local supermarket. Women's razors and men's razors are relatively the same. The only difference is that women's razors are designed to hug around natural curves in the body.


Electric razors are also available, but won't result in as close of a shave.
Getting cut by the razor blade indicates you may need to replace the razor. Razors are durable, but you should switch them up when they begin losing their efficiency.

, It is recommended you use shave gel when you shave. Soap and water alone will dry out the skin.Have a quick shower to moisten the body and open up your pores. Following that, lather the shaving gel over the area you're going to be shaving. It can be helpful to apply gel to a certain area and shave that before moving to other parts.

, Shave down the leg before you shave up. It's a good idea to run the razor along your skin in a gentle, smooth motion. Sudden, jerky movements or thoughtless angles can risk you accidentally cutting yourself.

, If left untreated, it can result in ingrown hairs, which are a bother to tend to. If you get nicked or burned, apply an exfoliating body scrub to the area and give your skin some care. Rub the affected area and remove dead or damaged skin flakes from the area.

, Because electric shavers can be used without first moistening the skin, they're a perfect thing to take along with you on the go.Although it won't leave your legs hairless for as long of a time, the quickness and convenience makes it a good way to deal with it if you're in a pinch for time.


Electric shavers require a degree of maintenance. Change your electric razor blade annually, assuming you're using it on a semi-frequent basis., While shaving is usually the most painless hair removal method, a shave doesn't last very long. Shaving leaves the hair follicles intact, meaning that the hair will grow back in a few days. Additionally, shaving can lead to razor burn, dry skin, bumps/nicks, and possible cuts. Ingrown hairs might form as well. Consider switching to an alternate method that removes the hair at the root.

Potato - Thinly slice a potato and rub a slice on the dark area. Or, you can grate some of the potato to release the ""juice."" Apply this juice to your underarms, let it dry 10 minutes and rinse.

Cucumber - Just as you did with the potato, you can rub cucumber slices on the affected area or grate some of the cucumber and use the juice. You can go a step further and add a few drops of lemon juice and some turmeric (enough to make a paste) to the cucumber juice. Apply the paste, wait a half hour and wash off.

Lemon - Rub a thick slice of lemon on the dark area; the fruit will remove dead skin cells and lighten the skin. Follow-up by washing and, if necessary, applying moisturizer. (With continued use, lemons can dry out the skin). Add a small amount of tumeric, plain yogurt or honey to lemon juice to make a paste that can be left on for 10 minutes and then rinsed clean.

Egg oil - Gently massage egg oil on the dark area and leave on overnight; the omega-3 in egg oil promote re-epithelisation (new skin cells) which make the skin smooth and light. Wash in the morning with a pH balanced soap or body wash.;
, The single most important thing you can do to prevent or treat dark underarms is to moisturize the area at least twice a day. Prefer to use natural moisturisers like aloe vera, lecithin etc.

, Dark underarms may be caused by dead skin cells that have accumulated there, so exfoliating can reduce the dark appearance of the skin.



Sugar - Mix a cup of brown sugar with 3 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil. Apply to wet skin for a minute or two during a shower or bath and rinse. Try using the mixture twice a week when you bathe.

Baking soda - Make a thick baking soda-and-water paste to use as a scrub. After scrubbing, rinsing and drying the area, you can apply a dusting of baking powder to the skin to give it a lighter appearance.

Baking soda and rosewater - Make a somewhat thick paste of baking soda and rose water. Apply to the underarm area, then wash off with warm water. Dry your arms. Do this until you see lightening of armpits.

Orange - Peel an orange and put the peels out in the sun to dry. Grind the peels to form a powder and make a paste by adding rose water and milk. Scrub your underarms with the paste for 10 to 15 minutes to remove dead skin cells and rinse with cold water.

Pumice stone - Gently remove dead skin cells from under your arms with the use of a pumice stone. This light-weight, abrasive volcanic rock is sold in drug stores and beauty supply stores. Wet the stone thoroughly and gently scrub the underarm area.

, Open your refrigerator or kitchen cupboard to find remedies that can not only lighten dark underarms but make the skin softer and fresher



Milk - It's the vitamins and fatty acids in milk that make it effective in lightening dark skin. Create a paste of two tbsp. milk, one tsp. curd and one tbsp. flour. Apply to the skin, let sit for 15 minutes and rinse with cold water. Skin should be softer and free of dead skin cells, which will make the area look much lighter. You can get even better results with full fat milk cream.

Vinegar - For a lighter look and germ-free, sweet-smelling skin, mix vinegar with rice flour to form a paste. Take a hot shower and then apply the paste to the underarms, let dry for 10-15 minutes and rinse with warm water.

Coconut oil - The Vitamin E in coconut oil can help lighten dark skin over time, so for best results it should be used daily or every other day. Before bathing, massage the oil into the skin for 10 to 15 minutes. Rinse with a mild soap and lukewarm water. Another benefit of coconut oil--it's a natural deodorant.

, If you're willing to commit to a frequent treatment regimen, you can try a natural whitening pack made from gram flour (also known a chickpea flour). Mix the flour with yogurt, lemon and a little turmeric to form a thick paste. Apply and leave in place for at least 30 minutes before rinsing with warm water. Apply this whitening paste daily for two weeks and then three times a week to speed up the whitening effect.

, Dark underarms may be caused by thick hair under the skin due to shaving. Because waxing removes hair at the root, it may leave the area lighter and the skin softer.

, The strong antiperspirant chemicals of deodorants often darken underarms by an inflammatory response. Very few people actually have a problem with body odor and most do not need the widely advertised deodorants.

You can get your hair waxed for anywhere from $35-80 at a salon. Your skin will be smooth for three weeks on average. After that, it'll be time to return to the salon for another session.

, Although latest advances in waxing technology will allow you to wax your skin earlier than before, you still need to let hair grow to 2-4mm.Although no one likes having to wait for their hair to grow, 2 millimetres is barely anything, any you'll have it waxed off in no tie. Allowing your hair to grow longer may result in a more painful tear.


2-4mm may not be enough for cheaper waxing strips. It's a good idea to follow the instructions of whatever kit you're using.

, Try to do it a day in advance; that way, you can limit the risk of irritating your skin.

, You can rub them vigorously, or hold them over a candle until they heat.Apply the strips evenly, and make sure they're relatively smooth on your skin before you tear them off.


You can also make hair removal wax at home, if you're the DIY type.

, Speed is the key in making your waxing as painless as possible.Take your strips at the end at pull them off as you would a band-aid. Tear it away in a short, swift motion. It also helps to wax during a time where you're not feeling otherwise rushed or stressed. The body is more receptive to pain when your nerves are frayed.

Use an epilator.Epilators are handheld machines that remove hair by pulling out individual hairs by their roots.,
Apply a depilatory cream.Depilatory creams work to dissolve hair on the surface of your skin without irritating the skin itself.,
Fight ingrown hairs.,
Consider laser hair removal.Laser surgery is considered extreme by some people, but there's no arguing with results.",How to Deal with Thick Leg Hair3," On the plus side, they result in an incredibly smooth feeling comparable with waxing. However, because you're removing the hairs one at a time, epilating your legs may take quite a while.


One benefit that epilators have over waxing is the fact that they can pull out hairs as short as 0.5mm. This means you never have to wait for the hair to grow out before you remove it again.Taking hairs out from the root never feels pleasant. Although some may find the epilator less painful than waxing, the discomfort lasts a lot longer.

, Lather the cream gently onto your skin and leave it for ten minutes while it does its work. Once enough time has passed, the hairs will come off along with the cream when you wipe it away from your legs.


Depilatory creams can be found in the health section of your local supermarket. You can also purchase a number of versions online., Hair follicles sometimes re-enter the skin and can't be waxed or epilated. Prevention is key here, so exfoliate often and follow up with a moisturizer. A loofah or body cloth works well with delicate skin, while a body scrub or gel exfoliate can tackle tough skin.

, Concentrated lasers will work to destroy follicles completely. The affected hair will fall out within 2-3 weeks. However, it is notably more expensive than home-based treatments, and requires several trips back to the Doctor's office before the procedure is complete. If you have particularly thick leg hair, you may have to schedule more appointments than the average.

Stop electrolysis.",How to Get Rid of Dark Armpits2," Home remedies may not help with dark underarms if you're suffering from a condition known as acanthosis nigricans, a skin disorder that results in velvety, light-brown-to-black markings in areas that include the armpits.


This condition can occur as a result of obesity or an endocrine (glandular) disorder. It is frequently found in people with diabetes or a tendency towards diabetes and is most common among people of African descent. Other possible causes of acanthosis nigricans include Addison's disease, pituitary gland disorders, growth hormone therapy, hypothyroidism or the use of oral contraceptives. , If your condition is diabetes related, modifying your diet to restrict starches and sugars may help.

, If oral contraceptives are at the source of your skin condition, you can try switching to a different form of birth control to see if the condition improves once the medication is stopped.

, Retin-A, 20% urea, alpha hydroxyacids, and salicylic acid prescriptions may help, but they've been found to be only minimally effective. The most widely used ingredient in skin lighteners sold in the U.S. is hydroquinone, which is regulated by the FDA. Dermatologists can write prescriptions for lighteners that contain up to 4% hydroquinone. Over-the-counter skin lighteners can contain no more than 2% hydroquinone.Always check with your doctor before using a product that contains hydroquinone.
Use skin lighteners sold by trusted brands. Although the FDA banned the use of mercury in skin lightening products in the U.S. in 1990, lightening creams that contain this toxic metal have been found here. These products were manufactured in other countries but sold in stores in the U.S., so read labels very carefully when shopping for this product. , All women, but especially those with dark skin run the risk of hyperpigmentation (skin darkening) when they use electrolysis for hair removal. If you've been having electrolysis treatments to remove the underarm hair, stopping the treatment should stop more discoloration from occurring.

If you intend to have another sugaring appointment in the near future, moisturizing is especially important.Moisturize using natural oils over lotions that contain chemicals. Natural oils and body butters work well.
You should not moisturize the day of your appointment. Wait at least 24 hours to begin moisturizing.

, Ingrown hairs are a common complication associated with sugaring. To prevent an ingrown hair, do a dead sea salt soak within the first 24 to 48 hours of your appointment. You can buy dead sea salt online or at a local health foods store.Fill you sink with cold water and then add 2 to 4 tablespoons (29.6 to 59.1 ml) of salt. Take a clean towel and soak up some of this solution.
Apply this cold compress to the area where hair was and leave on for about 15 minutes., With sugaring, exfoliation is important to the after care process. You should exfoliate 2 to 7 times a week following your appointment. To exfoliate, you can use an exfoliating gel you purchase at a drug store. You can also try walnut scrub, pumice scrub, or scrub gloves.It's best to exfoliate in the shower. Rub your chosen gel into the area where hair was removed. Rub somewhat vigorously, as you'll need to loosen the skin.
Rinse when finish and pat dry when you get out of the shower.

, In the days following your appointment, your skin will likely be sensitive. Your sin may also be more prone to infection. While you may be tempted to scratch, as your skin may be itchy, refrain from doing so. This can further irritation.If you find yourself very tempted to scratch, you can try clipping your fingernails short. You can also put scotch tape over your nails to prevent you from scratching.

, As exercise can cause sweat and skin irritation, do not exercise immediately following your treatment. It may be a good idea to get your work out in prior to your sugaring appointment. You can also make the appointment on a day you do not normally work out.Talk to the staff where you had your sugaring appointment done about exercise. When you can exercise again may depend on where the hair was removed.

, Hot water can irritate sensitive skin. Baths and hot tubs especially harbor bacteria, and your skin will be sensitive to infection. You also do not want to burn exposed hair follicles, as this can prolong the healing process. Stick to showers and use lukewarm water., Sugared skin is very sensitive to UV raise and may burn easier. For the 24 hours following your sugaring appointment, stay out of the sun as much as possible. You should also avoid tanning beds.If your skin is sunburned, do not have a sugaring treatment. Wait until your skin has healed to schedule your appointment.

, Your body will be more prone to infection after a sugaring appointment. If you removed your pubic hair via sugaring, avoid sex for at least 24 hours. This will give your hair enough time to heal., It will take anywhere from 24 to 28 hours for your skin to heal after sugaring. It's very common for red spots to form on sugared areas. These spots form where the hair root was removed, and may look somewhat similar to a sun burn. Do not worry about such spots as they'll clear up in a few days., In the event you get an ingrown hair, treat it promptly. Ingrown hairs can cause serious skin irritation if left untreated. You can use topical gels designed to treat ingrown hairs at a local supermarket. If ingrown hairs do not clear up on their own, see a dermatologist.Doing sea salt soaks regularly following a sugaring appointment can prevent the formation of ingrown hairs.

, If you notice redness, itching, burning, or other symptoms that do not go away within 24 or 48 hours, see a dermatologist. Sugaring is usually safe, but can make your skin more susceptible to infections. If you have a rash that you suspect may be infected, make an appointment with a dermatologist.

Check the packaging.,
Buy your salts from a reputable source.,
Choose salts with crystalline grains.",How to Choose a Bath Salt1," All bath salts start as sea salt, but if they're too processed, they can lose their beneficial qualities. Look for bath salts in packages that read ""natural"" or ""pure."" Those are the most likely to have retained their best ingredients., Pharmacies usually have high quality bath salts for purchase. Some spas do, too. If you can’t find them in a spa or pharmacy, look for reputable, natural brands in your favorite stores instead. Burt’s Bees and Roques Oneil, for example, are companies known for their natural products, and they both have a line of bath salts.Don’t buy your salts from places like smoke shops. They're not meant for use in your bath.

Turn on the water.,
Take off your clothes.,
Remind yourself why you need to shower.",How to Take a Shower if You Don't Want To1," Sometimes in order to accomplish what feels like a monumental task, you have to start small. For now, just go and turn on the shower. Get the water nice and warm and think about how good it would feel to climb inside. You'll probably find it much easier to shower once you're actually in the bathroom and have everything all ready to go.The hardest part often lies in simply taking the first step.
Remember, the only thing holding you back is lethargy. With that out of the way, nothing can stop you.;
, Once you've made it to the bathroom and got the shower running, strip down and see how you feel. At this point, it will probably feel silly to have gone to all that trouble just to shut off the water and put your clothes back on. Since you're already in position, and it requires just as much effort to get dressed again, you might as well go ahead and hop in the shower.


When you're lounging comfortably on the couch, the list of things you need to do to successfully bathe can seem overwhelming. Instead of trying to focus on lots of details at once, move things along a little at a time.

, If you find that you lack the motivation to shower, it can be helpful to keep in mind what happens when you don’t bathe regularly. Dirt, oil and dead cells can build up on your skin, making you feel grimy and uncomfortable. If you go too long, this can cause problems like itching, clogged pores and skin infections. After a while, you can start to smell, as well, which can be a source of social embarrassment.It can be bad for you to go too long without a bath or shower. Skin conditions like acne, dermatitis and chronic body odor can develop, making you look and feel unhealthy.There’s no need to shower every day. In fact, dermatologists now believe that it’s actually better for you to only shower a few times a week. This may make dealing with the task easier for you."

Choose a thick towel.,
Select a soft towel.,
Pick a durable towel.,
Choose a towel made of ringspun cotton.,
Go for a terrycloth towel if you want a durable towel.",How to Choose Bathroom Towels2," Towel thickness is measured in grams per square meter (GSM). A thin towel is about 300-400 GSM, and might be acceptable for the gym or kitchen, but not for the bath. A low-weight bath towel is between 400-600 GSM. Heavier and more absorbent bath towels are 600-900 GSM.Heavy towels can absorb more liquid than thinner towels. Unfortunately, these thicker towels take longer to dry.
Appropriately thick towels are likely made of high-quality cotton varieties like Pima or Egypt cotton.Terrycloth towels are the most absorbent variety. They are constructed with extra yarn and larger thread loops to maximize absorbency., Towels that are soft will not chafe or irritate your skin. People with sensitive skin might enjoy soft towels. It can be hard to tell which towels will remain soft over the long term. After they’re washed, towels tend to lose their softness. However, towels made of rayon tend to be quite soft. Towels of high-quality Pima or Egypt cotton are also very soft.Turkish cotton is also exceptionally soft.You might be able to increase the softness of your towels with fabric softener, but they will become more flammable and less absorbent.
The softest towels are often made with long-staple or extra-long-staple (ELS) cotton. Turkish, Pima, and Egyptian cottons tend to be ELS or long-staple cottons, as are Supima or MicroCotton fabrics., Invest in towels that will not easily shred in the washer or due to use. The most durable towels are two-ply, rather than one-ply. Cotton towels, or towels made of a cotton/polyester hybrid thread, are more durable than those of rayon. However, cotton/polyester towels are less absorbent than those of pure cotton.A durable towel should last about 10 years or more.Towels using long-staple or extra-long-staple (ELS) cotton are stronger than those of regular cotton. Most towels made with Turkish, Egyptian, Pima, Supima, or MicroCotton are ELS or long-staple cotton.Towels of combed cotton are composed of cotton which is combed before use to remove shorter threads and other undesirable bits.This combing process leaves behind only the strongest cotton and prevents pilling., Ringspun cotton is one of the most durable types of cotton. It combines long and short fibers to create finer threads.Ringspun cotton towels feel smoother than regular cotton or combed cotton., Terrycloth towels might be made of linen or cotton, and can be woven or knitted. Their larger thread loops and extra yarn make them especially durable. Choose a Terrycloth towel if you value durability in your towels and don’t mind long drying times."

Buy an eco-friendly towel.,
Find towels to compliment your bathroom.,
Buy a towel that has a sheen.,
Buy a decorative towel.,
Return poor-quality towels.",How to Choose Bathroom Towels3," It’s important to choose towels that are sustainably sourced and easy on the environment. Look for towels that are made with organic materials free of biocides and fertilizers. Organic cotton is just as soft and durable as regular cotton. Another eco-friendly option is to buy towels that are “quick-dry” since they require less time in the laundry., Your towels can provide the perfect finishing touch to your bathroom – if you choose the right color. Find complimentary colors and stack them neatly on the counter between two bathroom sinks, or place them on a shelf. For instance, if your bathroom is painted magenta or aqua, you could try a set of white towels.White towels are almost guaranteed to match any bathroom, though they stain the easiest.
If you have a white bathroom, try towels in a vivid primary color like blue, green, or red.

, Towels of Turkish cotton have a natural sheen that can add pep to a dull bathroom. Towels of viscose – a synthetic fiber made of bamboo plants – also have a natural sheen that looks great stacked neatly on the bathroom counter., If you’re buying towels mainly for decorative purposes, you should locate jacquard towels that have beautiful patterns woven directly into the fabric. A related type of towel, the print towel, has a printed image or design on the towel’s surface. Embellished towels have a fancy trim or embroidery to enrich their surface. These towels won’t stand up to frequent laundering or heavy use, and should be treated delicately., When you buy towels, you should also purchase a single washcloth made by the same manufacturer, in the same color as the towels you purchased. Place the washcloth and the receipt in a drawer and do not use it. If your towels fade after washing, bring the towels, the receipt, and the unused washcloth back to the retailer where you obtained them. Show them the towels and compare them to the unwashed washcloth to prove that they’ve faded."

Give yourself a pep talk.,
Think of it as a challenge.,
Get in the habit.",How to Take a Shower if You Don't Want To2," Instead of waiting around until you feel like taking a shower, talk yourself into making the resolution that you’re going to do it no matter what, and stick to it. Be your own coach. Give yourself encouraging advice and offer affirmation by making inspiring and affirming statements. You’ll start feeling more capable as soon as you shift your attitude from ""I don't want to"" to ""I can do this.""Most of the time when people have a hard time making themselves do something, it’s because they dread the effort or they’re “not in the mood.” Understand that there will always be things you don’t feel like doing in life that have to be done nonetheless.
Saying your own name can make you feel more empowered by allowing you to step outside of yourself momentarily and creating a sense of personal accountability., Put your pride on the line and start looking at overcoming your reluctance to shower as a way to prove yourself. If you can’t even bathe yourself, what else won’t you be able to do? It may sound silly, but this is an opportunity for personal growth. Show yourself that you can do what you set your mind to and you’ll feel more in control of other areas of your life as a result.Start making a list of daily goals to accomplish and put showering near the top.You’ll gain a little more willpower and self-control every time you shower when you don’t feel like it.

, Once you manage to make yourself shower, do it again the next day at the same time, then the next day, then the next and so on. Don’t let yourself skip a day or beat around the bush until it’s too late. After a week or so, your inertia will start to disappear and showering will become just another part of your normal routine.Set a regular bathing schedule for yourself based on your own needs and preferences. Some people might have to shower everyday, whereas others can get by with only a few showers a week, or even once a week. Pick days and times that will make it easier for you to stick to your schedule.
When showering becomes a habit, you’ll start to feel like something’s missing if you don’t take one.

Do some exercise.,
Wait until you can’t put it off any longer.,
Have a friend help out.,
Set alarms for yourself.",How to Take a Shower if You Don't Want To3," Perform an intense workout half an hour before you need to take a shower. You’re much more likely to be in favor of a shower if you’re sweaty and uncomfortable. Think about how refreshed you’ll feel once you’re done, or at least how much worse you’ll feel (and what people will think) if you don’t wash off.Strenuous exercise dampens your clothes, makes your skin and hair a greasy mess and causes you to smell bad.
Taking a cold or lukewarm shower will help cool you off after a tough workout.

, If you have a business meeting, dinner plans or an important event to attend that you need to look your best for, let it get down to the wire so that you have to get in the shower before you can finish getting ready. The closer it gets to time to leave, the more necessary it will be for you to clean up, until you just don’t have a choice anymore.


Keep in mind that you might make a bad impression if other people can tell that you haven’t bathed.
Finding compelling reasons to get things done is often more motivating than just feeling like you should.

, Persuade a sibling or close friend to nag you about showering every chance they get. You can get them to ask “have you showered today?” or even scold you for your stubbornness so that you’ll feel guilty or embarrassed if you don’t get it done. Instruct your helper to be as intrusive and annoying as they need to be in order to push you. Eventually, you’ll be eager to rinse off just to shut them up.


If you’re really serious about getting a friend to help keep you accountable, hand over the money in your wallet and tell them not to give it back to you until you’ve showered.It can be tough to do what you need to do when you’re the only one watching, but bringing a respected elder or authority figure into the mix can compel you to shape up by causing you to fear the consequences of disappointing them.

, Schedule a series of alarms on your phone that will direct you to shower when they go off. If you tend to be forgetful, this will help remind you that you haven’t done it yet. If you’re just being stubborn, the alarms will serve as a stern, persistent voice demanding that you take care of business. Do you really want the alarms to win? Didn’t think so. Take a shower.


Make the alarms sporadic at first, then set subsequent alarms closer together as it gets closer to whatever time limit you’ve imposed on yourself (going to bed, getting ready for a date, etc.).
Alarm reminders can be a great solution if you tend to simply forget to shower.

It’s about enjoying a moment of leisure as much as it is getting clean.


Showering serves as a time out from the rest of the world, giving you a chance to be alone and get some much-needed peace and quiet.
Try not to overdo it—too much time in a hot shower on a regular basis can strip your skin of the healthy, natural oils it needs., Stock up on musky soaps or silky body washes, fragrant shampoos and face scrubs or a fluffy new loofah. You’ll hardly be able to wait to take a shower if you’re excited about pampering yourself. When you use these types of products, you’ll also feel totally refreshed once you leave the shower, which can make you look forward to the next one.Change up the scents and formulas of your bath products every few weeks to keep them from getting old. For example, you might use a fresh-smelling floral body wash during the summer, then switch to an evergreen fragrance for the winter months.

, It’s no fun at all to climb into a shower covered with mold or soap scum with a weak trickle of water pouring out of the shower head and hair clogging the drain. If your facilities are in need of a deep cleaning, it can ruin much of what’s rewarding about bathing for you. Give everything a good wipe down and see if you can still resist that spotless, inviting shine.To prevent mildew and keep your bathing environment sanitary and inviting, aim to clean your shower every 2-3 weeks.Mix up a quick, organic cleaning solution using two parts white vinegar and one part warm water.

Listening to music will give you something to focus on other than the tedium of lathering, rinsing and repeating. You can even have your own private dance party or sing along as loud as you like—as long as the other people in the house don’t mind.Invest in a watertight phone case or some waterproof speakers that you can bring into the humid bathroom with you.Put together a special playlist to queue up while you’re showering, complete with hits like “Splish Splash,” “So Fresh, So Clean” and “Wade in the Water.”

Rinse out your shampoo and soap.,
Use conditioner, if applicable.",How to Take a Navy Shower," You can do this simply by taking a one gallon bucket and gauging the length of time it takes for the bucket to fill. If your one gallon bucket fills in one minute, and you take a 15 minute shower, you will use an estimated 15 gallons of water (15 minutes x 1 gallon/minute = 15 gallons)


The goal of a navy shower is to reduce the amount of water you use to about 10-11 gallons. To reach this goal you must first understand your average water consumption.;
, Using the information you have gathered about the flow rate of your shower, determine the amount of water on average you use. You can do this by multiplying the amount of water used in a minute by the total minutes on average you shower.


The typical flow rate of a shower is approximately four gallons per minute. If you have difficulty measuring your flow rate for some reason, use this number to predict the total gallons used.

, You can install a ""flow controller"" from a local hardware store to make your navy shower even more efficient. If conservation is your goal, this option is a worthy addition.

, You can also use it to shave.








, Step into the shower and quickly get yourself fully wet before turning the shower off. Use your hands or a washcloth to fully douse your body before turning off the water.








, Perform this while your shower is off by using a loofah, washcloth, or your hands.It's a good idea for you to scrub yourself firmly. You will not have the benefit of running water and its additional cleansing effect.









Perform your washing quickly, especially if you have an inefficient water heater. Waiting too long can create unpleasant variances in the temperature.

, Now that you've finished washing yourself thoroughly, rinse yourself off with a short blast from the shower.








, Using a short blast to ensure your hair is clear of shampoo and sufficiently wet, turn the shower off while lathering your hair. When you're finished applying your conditioner, turn the water on and quickly rinse off.

If you are concerned about having enough time to shower and change after the gym activity, talk to your gym teacher about finishing early enough to get back to the locker room.;
, It is common for students to be nervous or uncomfortable with the idea of taking off their clothes around their peers.Don’t let this be an excuse and don’t let it stop you. Not cleaning yourself off after getting sweaty and dirty will only clog your pores. Bacteria love to breed in sweaty clothes, so the sooner you get out of them, the better.Remember that the purpose of your gym class is to help promote a healthy lifestyle. When students don’t shower, they tend to work less during class to avoid a sweat, which can create bad habits later in life.If you are prepared to shower after class, you can push yourself more during gym to get the most out of it.

, You need to rinse off your skin, which is where all the dirt and sweat are. Keeping them on will only make it harder to get clean. Plus, your clothes will get soaked and clingy, which makes them even harder to take off.


While you may be nervous about getting naked, you shouldn’t leave your underwear on. Wet underwear will be clingy and uncomfortable, and won’t dry quickly when it’s under your clothes. Plus, it’s a breeding ground for bacteria, which can be really uncomfortable in the areas underwear tends to cover.

, Public showers like in your locker room are breeding grounds for athlete’s foot and other fungus. Try to bring something like flip-flops or shower shoes to keep your feet off the ground even as you get clean.Your footwear needs to be open so you can at least rinse off your feet. Don’t wear socks, or something else that will soak your foot without rinsing it off.

, You’ll probably be pressed for time after gym class, so this isn’t the opportunity for a full body wash. Instead, focus on getting the water to run over all parts of your body. If you are using soap or shampoo, be sure to rinse off all the suds.The most important thing is to get ready for class, not to get a full-body cleaning. You should get that at home. Besides, overall shorter showers are better for you anyway.

, If you don’t use a towel, or even just a rolled up shirt, make sure you dry yourself off with something you won’t be wearing. Avoid scrubbing yourself hard to get everything dry, as this can irritate your skin. Instead, quickly pat yourself down to get rid of the excess moisture., You’ve only rinsed yourself off, so you’ll probably want a little extra help to keep odors away. Use a deodorant that fits your body type and activities, and use it to prevent further smells.

, You don’t want to walk around in your smelly, sweaty gym clothes, otherwise there wasn’t any point to showering. Make sure you get dressed again by putting your regular clothes back on so you are ready for class.

, Make sure you have something else to carry your gym clothes in that you can close up. You don’t want to just throw them in your backpack with your school materials, otherwise everyone will still get that sweaty smell. If you can, put the bag in your locker before your next class.

, Many people, especially teenagers in gym class, are insecure about their bodies, which can make showering uncomfortable. Find some ways to become more comfortable with your own body, which will help give you the confidence to get undressed around your peers.


Get naked at home. This shouldn’t be often or for too long, but be willing to spend a little bit of time in front of a mirror with your clothes off. The only way you are going to be able to face down your doubts directly is to confront them.Look for positive things about your body. Everyone has something they are proud of, so focus on those parts of you, and talk them up to yourself.You can also highlight areas you want to improve, but remember that you can fix those things with time and effort. Just avoid too much negative thinking, like comparing yourself to others, or believing you can’t change., One of the best ways to avoid insecurity about being naked with your peers is to minimize the amount of time that is actually occurring. Moving quickly is also helpful because you probably won't have a lot of time between the end of gym and the start of your next class.

, If your school’s locker room has separate stalls, close the curtain for a little extra privacy. If the showers don’t have curtains, you can bring your own curtain and shower rings for a little more privacy.If you do have a curtain to use, another thing to do is wear a towel around yourself between your locker and the shower. Take it off once you close the curtain, hang it outside. Once you are finished showering, put it back on before opening the curtain again.

, You don’t want other people paying attention to you while you are trying to take a shower, so make sure you are doing things that will help you blend in, and not give people something to talk about.Don't use strong-smelling shampoos and scents. That is just another reason for people to notice or pay attention to you.
Avoid talking to other people. If you don’t want people paying attention to you, don’t pay attention to them. Don’t try starting up a conversation with someone unless you really need something, like for them to move out of your way. Everyone in the locker room will be uncomfortable about getting naked, and talking to them will probably make it worse.

, Your focus while showering is to get yourself clean and ready for your next class. Don’t worry about what other people do or say, just make sure you are doing what you need to do.


If you are concerned about the way other people are acting toward you in the shower, tell the teacher or administrator, or your parents. You don’t have to let yourself be bullied like that.Don’t become the bully. If your biggest fear is that other people will make fun of you, don’t compensate by making fun of them. If you wouldn’t want someone to say something to you, don’t say it to them.

Play some soft, relaxing music.Turn on the radio or place your portable music player onto a set of speakers.,
Turn down the lights and light some candles instead.,
Try hanging some lavender from the showerhead.,
Try adding some live plants.,
Get out your fanciest towels.,
Consider transferring your bath products to pretty glass or plastic containers.",How to Take a Relaxing Shower1," You can play any type of music you find relaxing. If you cannot think of anything, here are a few suggestions:


Zen
Jazz
Classical
Instrumental pieces, especially piano
Nature sounds, such as rain, streams, and birdsong;
, Bright bathroom lights are often garish. If you have a headache, they can make it feel even worse. Candles have a soft glow, and can give your bathroom a more tranquil, relaxing feel. Keep them on the bathroom vanity, where they won't fall.


If you are worried about using real candles, consider using battery-operated ones instead. Many of the newer ones have a soft, flickering orange glow, just like a real candle. Some even come scented.
You can also consider getting a Himalayan salt lamp. Some can be plugged in while others require a candle. They have a very soft glow, and can help purify the air., Tie some lavender into a bundle with a piece of twine. Add a loop to the end of the bundle, and hang it from your showerhead. The heat and steam from the shower will help the lavender release its wonderful, calming aroma.Many people also find eucalyptus and lemongrass to be both relaxing and refreshing.
You can also fill a diffuser bottle with essential oil and leave it near your shower instead.

, Not only will this give your bathroom a hint of color, but it may also help it appear more serene and relaxing. Choose plants that like a lot of moisture and not a lot of sunlight, such as orchids, ivy, and philodendron.


Philodendron doesn't, even need soil. They can thrive in a small vase filled with fresh water.If you don't have a green thumb at all, consider decorating your bathroom with fake plants instead. Choose green, ivy type plants, over flowers. This way, they won't look out of place.

, Choose your largest, softest, fluffiest towels. If you have any with a fancy pattern or trim, get it out. These will help make that relaxing feeling from your shower last longer.


Large, white, fluffy towels in particular have a spa-like feel. Spas in general tend to be very relaxing.While you're at it, consider having a soft, fluffy bathrobe ready for you to slip into after your shower.

, This will give your bathroom a more luxurious feel which, in turn, can make your shower feel more relaxing. Choose some pretty glass bottles with pumps, or soap dispensers, and pour your liquid soaps, shampoos, and conditions to them.If you have a bar of soap, consider keeping it on a pretty dish.

, Showers can be a great place to wind-down and relax, and using a scented shower gel is a great start. How the shower gel smells, however, can either make it a pleasant experience, or a less-than-pleasant experience. Here are some things to think about:


Do you like cool or refreshing scents? Look for shower gels with lemon, orange, or other citrus-like smells. You can also buy something with cucumber or mint as well.
Do you like relaxing scents? Try something with chamomile, lavender, or rose.
Do you like sweet, dessert-like scents? There's cocoa butter and vanilla! Many fruit-scented shower gels, such as strawberry and passion fruit, also tend to smell very sweet and dessert-like.

, Different skin types have different needs, so you might want to consider buying a shower gel that suits those needs. You may also consider buying a body wash instead, which has a thinner consistency than shower gel. Both shower gels and body washes are used the same way.


If you have dry skin, consider using moisturizing body wash instead.Look for something with added moisturizers, and try to avoid scented ones.Most shower gels and body washes will say on the bottle whether if they are good for dry skin.
If you have normal skin, then you are in luck, and can use almost any time of shower gel you want. Keep in mind, however, that shower gels intended for dry skin will be extra moisturizing, while those intended for oily skin will be somewhat drying. You can also consider using a body wash instead.If you have oily skin, then you can use most shower gels, but consider looks for ones with clarifying properties, or ones that have been designed specifically for your skin type.

, Just because you have sensitive skin and break out in rashes after using certain soaps does not mean that you can't use shower gels at all. There are many things that might contribute to your allergic reactions, including perfumes and certain chemicals. When choosing a shower gel, consider something that is perfume-free, or made out of natural and organic materials.


Sodium laurel sulfate is responsible for creating most of the lather in shower gels, but some people are allergic to it. This may also be the case for you. Consider trying a shower gel that is SLS-free., Some shower gels include exfoliants that help scrub away dead skin cells, leaving your skin feeling soft and supple. An exfoliating shower gel may include different types of organic abrasives, such as crushed walnut shells, fruit seeds, ground almonds, oatmeal, sea salt, and sugar.It may also include inorganic abrasives, such as microbeads.


Studies have shown that microbeads, which are usually made from plastic, can be very harmful to the environment and ecosystem as they cannot be filtered out by water treatment systems., Sometimes, shower gels are formulated for multiple uses, such as cleaning your body and washing your hair. If you are looking to save some money and cut a few corners, look for shower gels that say 2-in-1 or 3-in-1. These ones usually have a list of what else they can be used for, such as soap, shampoo, and bubble bath. Here are some other ideas:


While it is possible to use shower gel for shaving, it is not always recommended, as shower gels do not soften and condition the skin and hairs as shaving creams do.
Using shower gel to wash hair is not recommended, unless the bottle specifically says that it can be used for hair. The ingredients used in most shower gels can be too drying for hair.
It is possible to use shower gel as a bubble bath, although you may not get the same amount of suds. To increase the suds, consider mixing the shower gel with an egg white or some glycerin before adding it into the tub. Be sure to pour it beneath running water, and then agitating the water with your hand.

, By making your own shower gel, you get to decide exactly what goes into it. You can also customize it with butters, essential oils, fragrances, and other types of oils, to suit your needs.

, Unlike soap, shower gel comes in a fluid form, which means that it can't be simply massaged over your body. This section will show you the different things you can use to apply the shower gel to your skin and their benefits.

, Because of how porous they are, sponges produce great lather. They also tend to be gentle on the skin. There are two types of sponges: synthetic, plastic sponges and natural sea sponges.


Synthetic sponges are made out of plastic, and come in many different shapes and sizes. They tend to be softer than natural sponges.
Sea sponges are a natural product. They are mostly brown or tan in color. Unlike other types of sponges and loofah, both organic and synthetic, sea sponges contain natural enzymes that prevent bacteria, mildew, and mold from growing. They are also hypoallergenic., You can buy a loofah either as a pouf made from netted plastic, or as a natural, tubular sponge. Both are great for exfoliating the skin, although poufs tend to be gentler on the skin than loofahs.


Bath poufs come in all different colors. They are generally made from plastic, although it is possible to buy ones made from natural plant fibers, such as bamboo. They are soft and gentle on the skin. They are also great at producing lots of lather.
Natural loofahs are tube-shaped sponges made from the luffa plant. They are fibrous and coarse-textured, making them great at exfoliating away dead skin.

, You can also use a simple wash cloth or bath mitt to apply moisturizer. They don't produce as much lather as other types of sponges, but they provide the least barrier between your hand and your skin, thus allowing you to massage your skin while showering.


Washcloths are small, square pieces of towel. You can use almost any towel as a washcloth. They do not produce a lot of lather but are fairly easy to clean: just toss it in with the rest of your laundry.
Loofah mitts are square-shaped washcloths that fit over your hand. They are cloth on one side, and loofah on the other (the same material used in natural, loofah sponges).

, No matter what sponge you choose to use, you must take proper care of it by cleaning and drying it properly, or else it might start growing bacteria, which could lead to skin infections. Here are some ways that you can do this:Allow it to air dry. After you use your sponge, rinse it out, and then hang it outside the shower, away from any moist air. Let the sponge dry completely before using it again.
Microwave natural sponges. Make sure that your sea sponge or loofah is damp, then microwave it for 20 seconds to kill bacteria. Don't attempt this on a plastic sponge; instead, consider setting it out in the sun to dry.
Bleach it. Soak your sponge in bleach diluted with water. You want to use a solution of about five percent bleach.
Launder your washcloths. If you are using a small towel as a washcloth, you can clean it simply by tossing it into your next laundry load. Do not put your sponges into the dryer, however.
Replace it often. Poufs and loofahs should be replaced after three weeks, and sponges should be replaced after six or eight weeks., You can use any temperature that you are comfortable with, but keep in mind that very hot water may be damaging to the skin. If you tend to get dry skin, consider using cool or lukewarm water instead.Once you have set the temperature to your liking, step into the shower.

, You want a quarter-sized drop—about ½ teaspoon—of shower gel onto a bath sponge or washcloth. For more information as to what sorts of sponges and washcloths you can use, refer to the section in this article on choosing sponges.

, Squish and massage the sponge or washcloth until the soap begins to foam and lather. You only need to do this for a few seconds. Keep in mind, however, that some natural and organic shower gels will not lather as much as inorganic ones.

, Do not scrub too hard, especially if you are using anything abrasive, such as a loofah or a shower gel with exfoliants, or you may irritate your skin. Instead, massage your body with the sponge or washcloth, just as you would with a bar of soap.

, Once you have soaped yourself all up, it is time for you to rinse that soap off. Some of it may already have come off during your shower, which is fine. Simply turn around in the shower until the soap has rinsed off. You may have to raise your arm or leg, and rub water over the skin to get all of the soap off.

, Don't rub the towel over your skin. Instead, lightly pat your skin dry with the towel. If you tend to get dry skin, then consider leaving your skin slightly damp, so that it can absorb the remaining moisture.Don't forget to conserve water by turning the shower off!

, Once you have finished drying yourself off, consider applying a moisturizer to your skin.This will help keep your skin soft, moist, and healthy.

You want to wash away any additives like perfume, soap residue, or conditioner that could throw off the composition of your bath. Make sure the tub gets a good rinse too after you’ve finished using any toiletries., The water should be at or just above body temperature. Himalayan salt baths are not meant to be taken in very hot water. If you have a thermometer, aim for about 97 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius)., As the water is running, add enough Himalayan salt to create a 1% solution. This means adding about 2.5 pounds (a little over 1 kilogram) to a standard-sized tub, which holds 27-32 gallons (102-121 liters) of water.Himalayan salts can be purchased online, at health stores, or at some organic grocery stores.

, A fine grain salt should dissolve quickly, but if your salts are chunkier this may take more time. If you’re concerned that your salts will take too long to dissolve, place them in a large bowl the night before and cover them with warm water. The next day, pour the entire contents of the bowl into the tub as it’s filling., Essential oils can increase your level of relaxation or rejuvenation in the bath. If you choose to use one, such as eucalyptus oil or lavender oil, add about 3 drops as the tub is filling with water. Do not add more than this, since it could irritate your skin., Salt baths can place a lot of pressure on your circulatory system, so if you have poor heart circulation, heart disease, diabetes, or are pregnant, always check with your doctor first to be sure that you can safely take a salt bath., You can quickly become dehydrated while taking a salt bath. Make sure you have a glass or water bottle near the edge of the tub to sip from while you soak., Soaking in a salt bath can be intense for your circulatory system and your muscles, so spend no more than 30 minutes in the tub. Even after that short amount of time in the salt water, you will likely feel weak when you get out of the bath., When you’re done, drain the tub and rise slowly. Hold onto something sturdy, like the edge of the sink, as you attempt to climb out. If you begin to feel dizzy, sit down immediately and sip some more water until you feel ready to stand again., The salt water is safe to leave on your skin, so no need to rinse yourself off or even wipe your whole body down with a towel. Use this drying time to rest for at least 30 minutes, since you will need some time to recover from the detox.It’s best to take this bath right before bed so that you won’t be doing any more physical activity for the day.

, Since Himalayan salt baths can be so intense, you should not be taking them every day. Start out by taking one a week, and then build up to two or three if you really like them."

Manage your expectations.,
Select clothing articles in good condition.,
Determine reserve prices for any important pieces.,
Wash and fold all the selected clothes.,
Find a local secondhand store that accepts children’s clothing.,
Donate rejected and well-worn items to charity.",How to Sell Used Kids Clothing1," While resale shopping has become increasingly popular over the last few years, you should know that selling your clothes to a buy/sell/trade outlet won’t recover the money you spent in the first place. Rather, think of it as a good way to make some pocket money while thinning out your brimming closets and bureaus.You can make your modest money-making venture a parent-child activity! Make a deal with your child that, if they help organize the old clothes and clean them, they can earn all or part of the proceeds.;
, Thrift stores need to make a profit off used clothing, so they have to be selective when deciding whether to purchase or pass on presented items. This means that you need to choose only gently worn articles from your kids’ old clothes. You can try to salvage minor signs of wear and tear like missing buttons or slight frays, but you should discard any soiled, ripped, or discolored items.While trends and seasons are less important for children’s clothing, you should give at least a bit of thought to how relevant your selected items are. For example, clothes bearing the logos of recent Disney movies like Frozen will sell better than those with outdated cultural references or labels, such as Warner Bros.In the same way, currently fashionable designers, such as Little Marc Jacobs or Missoni will be considered more desirable and sellable than labels associated with the '90s or 2000s, such as Abercrombie Kids or FUBU., Most old, outgrown clothing is useless, so you’ll be glad to earn even a couple bucks from it. If any of the items you’re considering selling are particularly expensive or sentimental, though, you should take some time to think about the lowest price you would accept for them.


For example, your daughter’s old Easter dresses might be unwearable, but they still evoke cherished, family memories. If this is the case, ask yourself what price would make giving them up worthwhile. Consider whether or not you have any photos of your daughter wearing the dresses, or if you have any relatives or friends to whom you might want to give them.
For expensive, designer pieces, consider the piece's condition and age. If it's still in good condition and relatively on-trend, you can try to sell it for around 70% of the original price, but you might need to go to a specialty online reseller or consignment shop, such as thredUp or consignmentmommies.com.

, Most secondhand stores don’t have the time or money to wash or spruce up their stock, so they need to be able to sell the items they purchase ‘as-is.’ You can help persuade the buyer to accept your items by presenting them in a clean, polished condition. Even if all your kids’ old clothes are clean, chances are they’ve been sitting around in storage for a while. Giving them another wash will make them smell fresh and shake out any limpness or wrinkles.

, It might seem silly given the high turnover and constant demand for kids’ clothing, but many thrift stores don’t sell kids’ or juniors clothes. Save yourself some time and a wasted trip by calling ahead to prospective shops and asking whether or not they accept children’s items.


Look for shops with references to children in the title, such as Trader Tots, Little Darlings, and Once Upon a Child., No matter how posh and well-preserved your child’s old clothes are, chances are that not all of your items will be purchased. Make the best out of the situation by giving the rejects to a philanthropic organization of your choice, or allowing the thrift store to channel them to their go-to donation center.


Salvation Army, Goodwill, Vietnam Veterans of America, and Cancer Research UK are all large organizations which accept clothing donations."
"
Check out online thrift stores, such as thredUP and swap.com.,
Make an account on an auction website.,
Photograph and post each item individually.,
Take bids through your social media accounts.",How to Sell Used Kids Clothing2," Whether you can’t find any brick-and-mortar shops in your area that sell kids’ swag, or you’re short on time, consider selling online. Services like thredUP and swap.com accept children’s clothing and can save you valuable time. They send you a pre-paid bag so that you can mail your items back whenever you have a spare minute.Be sure to pay ahead of time if you want any rejected items returned to you. Some shops charge a flat shipping fee for this return service, while others tack on an additional surcharge.

, Online portals like eBay are more time-consuming, but you can still make good money without leaving the comfort of your own home. It's also the best option if you have any collectible or vintage items, as interested buyers are much more likely to frequent online forums for specialty clothing than they are to go to a consignment shop.


When signing up for your account, you'll be prompted to register for PayPal or link up an existing PayPal account. As a seller, you'll have to pay a percentage on each transaction, so be prepared to foot the bill on things you didn't have to as a buyer.If you already have an eBay account from which you buy and sell other goods, consider changing your user name or seller profile to reflect the fact that you're now offering children's clothing., Selling on eBay means that you’ll be responsible for photographing, describing, and pricing each piece of clothing. The photo is particularly important, as potential buyers are unlikely to take risks on items they can't see clearly.Also take care when composing your item descriptions. For example, never say an item is in perfect condition or omit a product flaw, such as a faint stain or tear. Even if you think it's a minor problem, your buyer could feel cheated and leave you negative feedback., If you don't like the idea of paying a cut of your sales to eBay, consider using your Instagram account to sell your kids' worn clothes. Simply post photos of any items and have followers bid on them in the comments section.While auctions aren't prohibited on Instagram, they're also not expressly encouraged or facilitated. This means that you'll have to figure out a way to broker your transactions outside of the app.
For example, many sellers have the winning bidder leave their email address in the comments, and then the seller can send a money request through PayPal.

Sort through your old clothes to remove any stained or ripped items.,
Launder and iron all clothing.,
Advertise that your yard sale will include kids’ clothing.,
Display items by hanging them in a portable closet.,
Don’t list prices on any items.,
Offer two-for-one promotions toward the end of the day.",How to Sell Used Kids Clothing3," While you don’t have to cull your closet as carefully as you would when pitching to a thrift store, you should be a good neighbor and offer only unsoiled and intact items at your garage sale. Go through all your kids’ outgrown clothing and keep a sharp eye out for stains, discoloration, tears, or stretched fabric.

, You might think that putting out clean, ready-to-wear clothing is a common courtesy, but you’d be surprised how many people forget this step at their garage sale. Not only does this simple measure ensure that you adhere to yard sale etiquette, but it also boosts your items’ appeal and price point.If you don’t have time to iron each and every item, hang them up as soon as you remove them from the clothesline or dryer in order to prevent wrinkles before they begin.

, Instead of posting generic signs around your neighborhood that announce solely the date and location of your yard sale, be specific about what you’re offering! Since parents everywhere are in-need of good, cheap clothes for their growing children, they’ll be much more likely to go out and find your garage sale if you specify kids’ clothing on your advertisements.


Use bright colors and large lettering to make your sign as catchy and legible as possible.For example, add a note on your signs saying, “Huge selection of gently used articles of children’s clothing!”

, You’ve probably been to a garage sale or swap meet where you have to dig through big bins of tossed-together clothes. While this may be an no-hassle way of presenting your items, it’s hardly the most effective or appealing way to display clothing and entice buyers. Instead, hang your items on a mobile closet or rack so that buyers can see individual articles, or fold and organize them on large tables or shelves.If you don’t have a rolling portable closet, use a ladder and an old curtain rod propped between the rungs!Just because you’ve arranged your items with care, doesn’t mean that browsing buyers will show them the same courtesy. Keep your clothes optimally displayed by revisiting your racks throughout the sale and tidying up as the day goes on.

, Oddly enough, pricing your items is actually a good way to sabotage your yard sale game. Instead, have people inquire about individual items and ask what price they had in mind. Often, interested shoppers are willing to pay a much higher price than you would have listed. Alternately, if the listed price is too steep for a potential buyer, they’ll usually take this price point as ironclad without inquiring or haggling for a lower price.Instead of indicating specific prices, hang encouraging signs over your racks saying things like, “Great bargains,” or, “Don’t be shy! Ask about pricing!”

, Garage sales aren’t just meant to earn some extra cash over the weekend. They’re also designed to clear out those unused, extraneous items cluttering up your home and storage space, so keep this goal in mind as the day wears on. Encourage people to purchase and thin out your inventory by introducing special rates and BOGO promotions in the afternoon.

Buy from a personal shopping site.,
Look for sidewalk and sample sales.,
Avoid factory outlets.,
Buy from thrift stores.,
Shop at discount department stores.,
Rent clothes for important occasions.",How to Save Money on Clothes1," Personal shopping websites are a great way to find good deals on the brands you love. On these websites, you enter your favorite brands, and the website will search for the best deals on the brands of your choice. This is a good way to save money because you aren’t physically in a store, so you can shop for exactly what you need.Shop It to Me and Shopstyle are two personal shopping websites.
The websites will also send you an email when a sale is going on once you enter your email.
Filter the results by Price Low to High to view the lowest priced items first.;
, Sample sales are more common in a bigger city. A sample sale will usually have cheap designer clothes and accessories. A sidewalk sale is more common in a smaller town. Boutiques and malls will put out clothing that they may need to get rid of, or whatever is going out of season.You can find sample and sidewalk sale dates in your local newspaper and by checking online.

, Factory outlets can seem like a great deal because signs say that designer labels are 50% off. Often in factory outlets the clothes that are on display are the ones that didn’t sell well or not at all in the actual store. Despite the sales tag, you are typically paying the full price. Plus, the quality of the clothing is usually not very good.Instead, look for good sales on deals from the main store of a brand you like.

, The idea of secondhand clothing may make you nervous, but it shouldn’t. Most thrift shops won’t accept clothes that are not in good condition, and you can and should always wash the clothing you purchase before wearing it. You won’t always find a great deal, but sometimes you can find an amazing piece of clothing. Search carefully, as if you are on a treasure hunt. You can often find designer clothing for very low prices if you look hard enough.Pass over any clothing that has deep set stains or any odor.
Ask the thrift shop if you can exchange some of your unwanted clothing for store credit.

, Stores such as TJ Maxx, Marshalls, and Kohl’s will often have a great inventory that changes all the time. Some of the brands are smaller at these types of stores, but you can also find big name brands for smaller prices. Shop during sales for even better prices.Target and Ross are two other department stores to check out.

, It is possible to rent clothes for occasions that requires a certain type of dress code. The occasion might be for prom, a wedding, a ball, or formal dinner. The amount of time you borrow, the price, and the choice of clothes depends on the website you borrow from. A few websites you can rent clothes from are Rent the Runway, Bag, Borrow, or Steal, and Gwynnie Bee.You can also find websites where you can swap clothes instead of renting, like Swapdom.

Make a list of what you want.,
Decide on an amount you want to spend.,
Shop at the end of a season.,
Build a solid wardrobe comprised of clothing staples.,
Buy quality clothing.,
Avoid buying into trends.,
Compare the item to your current wardrobe before purchasing.",How to Save Money on Clothes2," Planning always works and does wonders when you are shopping. Look through your closet. Takes note of what you have, what you would like to replace, and what you need. Before going to the mall, prepare a list of what kind of clothes you need. Try to buy only what is on the list and nothing else., Before going shopping, set an amount that you want to spend. Do not go beyond that amount. Having a fixed price in mind will make you think carefully about what you are buying, so you will choose only what you really want or need. If you look for the best deals, you may end up with more clothing than expected for the price., When you buy pre-season, you are paying maximum retail price. Buying at the end of the season may seem frustrating because you may not be able to wear the clothes for a while, but it will save you money in the end. The prices will be at the lowest at the end of season, but there will often be sales during mid-season as well.For example, shop for winter coats at the end of winter, and shop for swimsuits at the end of summer.

, Don’t buy too much of one type of clothing. Instead, plan to buy one, two, or three pieces of every type of clothing. Think about your style, and base your wardrobe off of that. If you build a solid wardrobe, you won’t need to buy clothes as often because you can mix-and-match what you already have.Some staples of a wardrobe are black shirts, jeans, crewneck sweaters, white T-shirts, a button-down, black pants, a blazer, and a denim jacket. For women, a black dress, printed dress, and skirt for every season is good to add to your wardrobe., It may seem tempting to buy cheap, low-quality clothing, but it is not worth it in the long run. You can buy a larger quantity of cheap clothing, but it is doubtful that it will last as long as quality clothing. If you find a piece that costs a little more, but you know you will wear forever, invest in that item.Quality clothing may be more expensive, but you can still find good deals on them during sales.

, It is tempting to buy clothes that correspond with current trends, but it’s possible that the clothing won’t be worn again once the trends are over. Choose some basic, quality clothing that will outlast seasonal trends. You can still look great without wearing what everyone else is wearing.Instead of dressing trendy, work on developing a unique, personal style.

, Perhaps you find an amazing shirt, but it’s a little expensive. Before buying it, think about the style of your current wardrobe. If you have nothing to wear the item with, don’t purchase it. Chances are, the item would sit in your closet and rarely be worn.You should also consider how often you will wear an item. If the answer is rarely, then don’t buy it.

Avoid credit cards.,
Look for good bargains.,
Sign up for an email list.,
Ask for a discount on slightly damaged clothing.,
Use Ebates.,
Search for coupons.",How to Save Money on Clothes3," Only spend what money you have. If you have to put it on a credit card to afford it, then it is not worth buying. You should not go into to debt to buy clothes. If possible don’t use a card at all when purchasing a clothes—not even a debit card. Instead, use cash. Using cash will make the amount feel more real than simply swiping a card.It is also not recommended to avoid using a credit card because you will have to pay interest on the original amount if you don’t pay the payment on time.
Stores like Nordstrom Rack and TJ Maxx offer credit cards that offer rewards for purchases. If you decide to use any credit card, it is a good option to consider signing up for a store credit card.

, Shop during big sales. Large department and mall stores usually have an annual or semi-annual sale. It is the best time to buy quality clothing during these big sales. You can check out online deals, or look for sale advertisements in newspapers.Flash sales will sometimes pop up during the year as well. Stay mindful and don’t get too excited when you encounter one of these sales. It is easy to buy a lot because it seems cheap, but the amount will add up quickly.

, Join an e-mail mailing list to be informed when big sales are happening. Many stores will send you a reminder when sales or discounts are being offered if you enter your email on their website. Try to only sign up for stores you are really interested in, or your mailbox can become overrun with emails., If you see an item of clothing that has a small, but removable stain, or has a missing button that can be replaced, ask for a discount. Take the item of clothing to the register, show the damage, and ask if it is possible to take some money off of the full price. Often, the store will discount at least 10%.Make sure the stain can be removed before asking for a discount.
Don’t argue with the employee if they say that a discount can’t be made on the item.

, Ebates is an app that will send you cash back on your purchases. Simply use Ebates to get to the retailer you want to purchase from, and then you will receive some money in PayPal, or a check. You can also find coupons and deals through the Ebates website.Don’t expect a large portion of your money back on purchases. The amount you get back on a purchase may not be a lot, but it will add up over time.

, Even when sales aren’t going on, you can find clothing for a discounted price. Sign up for mailing lists, search the newspaper, and check out websites to look for coupons. You can also look at websites like RetailMeNot to find promotion codes and coupons.Check the receipt for a coupon when you make a purchase.

Start your measurement.,
Hold the tape tight.,
Note the measured number.",How to Measure Your Neck Size and Sleeve Length1," Wrap the measuring tape around the neck, beginning at about one inch from the meeting of your neck and shoulders. This may also coincide with the bottom part of your Adam's apple.;
, Come fully around the neck, leaving no dangling space in between the neck and the tape. Don't pull too tightly so as to create unnecessary tension, just enough so that you are getting a true measurement. Make sure the tape is level and not being held at an angle.

, This is the actual neck size. The dress shirt size will be half an inch bigger. For example, if you measure your neck to be exactly 15 inches (38 cm) around, then your dress shirt size will be 15½ inches (39.5 cm).


If you measured on a 1/4 inch/centimeter, then round up to the nearest 1/2 inch/centimeter. For example, if your neck size was 16.25, round up to 16.5.
Your neck size should range between about 14 - 19 inches or 35.5 - 48.3 centimeters.

"
Get in the proper stance.,
Place your measuring tape.,
Take your first measurement.,
Take your second measurement.,
Determine your sleeve length.",How to Measure Your Neck Size and Sleeve Length2," Before you begin measuring, stand still with your arms at your sides. Hold your arms slightly bent, with your fingers tucked into your front pockets.

, Begin at the middle of the upper back, slightly below the nape of your neck.

, Measure the length from the middle of the upper back to the stitching located at the shoulder of the shirt. Write this measurement down, as you will need it later.

, Measure the length from the top stitching on the shoulder to the bottom of the wrist. Aim for hitting your wrist bone with the measuring tape. Be careful not to measure too high above the wrist, or the dress shirt's sleeves will come to be too short.

, Add these two values together to find your sleeve length. The value should range anywhere from about 32 - 37 inches (81.3 - 94 cm)."
"
Using your measurements.,
Find a ready-to-wear size.",How to Measure Your Neck Size and Sleeve Length3," Men's shirt sizes come in a two-part number. The first number listed on the tag of the shirt is the neck measurement, and the second one is the sleeve measurement. For example, a shirt may be sized as 16/34. Use both your neck and sleeve measurements to find the right size.

, If the shirts you are browsing don't offer an exact measurement but rather the traditional ""small,"" ""medium,"" or ""large,"" options, you can use your measurements to find the equivalent in this style of sizing. Use the table below to determine the best size of shirt for you.

"
Look for flexible material.,
Try to find an object with a known length.,
Mark increments on the material.,
Lay the material on the body for measurement.",How to Take Clothing Measurements Without Measuring Tape1," Find a common item in your home that is flexible, meaning that it bends so you can use the length of it to measure curves on your body.


Try common materials like string, yarn, a piece of scrap fabric, or a cable.
Make sure the material you use isn’t precious, as you will be marking it up, cutting it, or otherwise potentially damaging it for use in taking measurements.;
, Look for an object that you have on hand that has an even, known length to allow for easy measuring. Depending on the object, you can either use it to directly measure on your body, or to measure the length of another material like string.


For instance, a standard American printer paper size is 8.5 inches wide by 11 inches long. An American dollar bill is 2.5 inches wide by 6 inches long.You can also look up the size written on the bottom of a baking pan, a box, or another object that you can easily find the exact dimensions of.

, If you don’t already know the exact length of the material you’re using in place of measuring tape, use a flat ruler to mark increments on it.


If you use a material that is long, you can mark off every 6 or 12 inches on it to measure longer lengths of the body, like inseam. On shorter material like a piece of paper or dollar bill, you can simply use it to measure one length at a time, or fold it in halves to measure smaller increments.
If you don’t have a ruler, you can measure lengths with standard objects like printer paper or a dollar bill. Or, approximate lengths using your hand and arm. The distance from your first knuckle to the end of your fingertip is about 1 inch, the distance across your palm underneath the fingers is about 4 inches, and the distance from elbow to fingertips is about 18 inches. However, these approximations vary on each body., Place your material across or around the part of the body you want to measure to find its length based on your marks or understanding of the material’s length.


If your material is too short to span the length of the area, place your finger as precisely as possible where the material ends and begin there with another length of the material, doing this as many times as you have to to reach the full length of the area.
If you want to find the length of an area of your body beforehand and then measure it afterward, place it on the area of your body you want to measure and carefully take hold of the material (or even cut it if it is a material like string) where the length of your body ends. Then use a ruler or approximate measurements from your hand to determine the length.
Make sure you write down all numbers and label them with the body measurement they correspond to.

Measure bust size.,
Take a waist measurement.,
Measure hip size.,
Find the inseam.,
Take any other measurements necessary.",How to Take Clothing Measurements Without Measuring Tape2," Find the size of your or another woman’s chest by wrapping your measuring material around the back over your shoulder blades, under the armpits, and across the fullest part of the bust.Ensure that you do not pull whatever material you’re using to measure too tightly around the chest.
To measure for a bra, bathing suit, or other garment that calls for it, you will use this bust measurement along with the circumference just below the bust to find the cup and band size., Use your measuring material to find the length around your or another woman’s torso at its smallest point, which is your natural waist. Find this point by observing where the torso creases when bending side to side, and note that it will fall above the bellybutton and below the ribcage.Note that there is a difference between the natural waist and where the waistband may be worn on pants, skirts, or shorts. When clothing measurements call for a waist size, it refers to the narrowest part of the torso, the natural waist. You may want to take another measurement below the natural waist where you know you will wear a garment.
Be sure to exhale and relax, or have the woman you’re measuring do so, before you take a waist measurement. The abdomen shouldn’t be enlarged with air, sucked in smaller, or otherwise in an unnatural or unrelaxed state., Wrap your measuring material around your own or another woman’s hips at their fullest point to determine hip size.


The fullest point of the hips is generally about 8 inches below the natural waist, but of course the distance varies from person to person. Take a few different measurements if you need to ensure that you find the widest point.
If you’re taking the measurement on yourself, make sure your measuring material is level across your hips and rear end by observing yourself in a mirror.

, Take the measurement of the inseam for a pair of pants by measuring along one leg from groin to ankle with the leg remaining straight.


This is best done on another person or with help from someone else to take a measurement on you. If you don’t have someone to help, you can also measure the inseam on a pair of pants that fits you well.The proper inseam for a pair of pants may vary depending on the style of pants and the height of the heel on the shoe worn with them., Use your measuring material to take any other measurements that a sizing chart or clothing pattern calls for.


Make sure that you always take a measurement from the fullest part or longest extension of a body part. Measure around the widest part of your arm or thigh, for example, and measure for the length of a sleeve with your arm bent to accommodate movement.It may be helpful to keep a piece of string or elastic tied around the natural waist, as it will be used as an endpoint for other measurements like front waist length, back waist length, and rise."

Find a chest measurement.,
Take a sleeve measurement.,
Measure the waist.,
Find the inseam.,
Take any other measurements necessary.",How to Take Clothing Measurements Without Measuring Tape3," Use your measuring material on your own neck or the neck of another man to measure the circumference at the base of the neck.


The measurement should be taken about an inch below the Adam’s Apple.Place a finger underneath your measuring material to accommodate extra room and comfort for a fitted shirt collar., Measure around your own chest or another man’s chest by wrapping your measuring material around the back over the shoulder blades, under the armpits, and across the fullest part of the chest.


The chest should not be flexed or sunken in but rather comfortable and relaxed, with the measuring material held snugly against the skin while exhaling.
Sport coat or suit jacket measurements will also include a letter after the chest size number. A Regular (R) typically fits men 5’7” to 6’, while a Long (L) fits 6’1” to 6’3”., Measure the length from the shoulder joint to the wrist bone to find the right length for a shirt or jacket sleeve.


For a shirt measurement, bend the elbow to accommodate for movement.
For a jacket measurement, measure from the outside edge of the shoulder down a straight arm to where you want a jacket sleeve to end., Take a waist measurement by holding your measuring material around your or another man’s torso, just above the bellybutton.


Make sure that you are in a relaxed posture and breathing out, not flexing or sucking in the abdomen when taking this measurement, or you are instructing the man you are measuring to do so.
Note that you may want to take a measurement at the hip, closer to where a waistband would come to, if you are measuring for trousers.

, Measure from crotch to ankle along the inside of one leg to find the inseam on yourself or another man.


If you cannot receive help taking this measurement on yourself, find the length on a pair of pants that fit you very well.
Typical men’s pants sizes list two numbers: the first is the waist measurement and the second is the inseam., Find any other measurements that a sizing chart or clothing pattern calls for using your measuring material.


Make sure you take measurements from the fullest part of the body where you are measuring.
You may need more measurements like wrist size, shoulder width, seat, and shirt/jacket length to fully fit a custom-made suit."

Make-up.",How to Dress Up in a Pencil Skirt with Color Blocking," If you are dressing up an outfit in color blocking for the first time, it is necessary to keep in mind that bright colors are quite difficult to carry off at the first time.


Start off by picking out a clothing item of any neutral color (beige, black, white, cream or any of their shades). It would be better if you choose the top to be of this color. Make sure the top is flowy or loose as this just balances out the outfit and makes it wearable on a daily basis.
Next up choose a bright color of your choice for the pencil skirt. Choose colors like hot pink, cobalt blue, mint green or orange. Make sure it suits your skin tone and personality. Choose neon colors if you wish. Neon colors are basically just highlighter versions of the bright colors.;
, Once you have chosen the base, it's time to get going with the scarves, belts and gloves.


Choose a coral shade for your scarf. Corals tend to efficiently compliment your neutrals.
Gloves, if needed should be of a bright color, contrasting the bright color you chose.
Belts can be black. Black just beautifully intensifies the Brightness of your pencil skirt.

, Add a few pieces of jewelry to your outfit. Go for delicate neck pieces. Earrings can be either delicate or bold depending on your choice of dressing. Go for feather earrings if you wish to wear a bold and beautiful look. If you wish to keep it subtle, choose studs that compliment your neutrals.

, Wearing heels gives you a lot of confidence, but make sure they are of the right height. If your heels are too high, you might just fall face first and convert the outfit into an unflattering mess. Wear pencil heels if you are comfortable or wedges if you like. Go for strappy sandals if you want to have a smart, everyday look.

, Bags and Clutches can be either neutral or pastel again depending on your style.

, This part is the make or break of your outfit. Wear very light make-up. A light foundation with an almost nude lipstick and light mascara can do good and enough.

Layer with a sheer dress.,
Layer with different sheer textures.,
Wear two sheer layers.,
Wear sheer pants.",How to Layer Sheer Clothing1," This is the easiest and most common way to layer sheer clothing. Put on a bra or tank top (if you don’t want to show your stomach) for the underneath layer. For the top, sheer layer, you can wear a sheer t-shirt, button-down, or a lace shirt. You can find lace shirts with designs, such as flowers, for a more interesting look.Consider the occasion when choosing your shirts. A bra and sheer shirt would be great for going out. A button-down is better for a dinner.;
, A sheer dress is a great way to pull together an outfit. There are several options for the bottom layer. You could wear a slip, a bra and tight skirt, or a tight shirt and leggings/pants. Just be sure that the bottom layer is form-fitting. Mesh dresses, sheer, slip dresses, and button-down chiffon dresses are some dresses that can be worn over the bottom layer.Consider the colors you’re wearing for the bottom layer when choosing a sheer dress. White under white looks classy. Black under white gives a more dramatic look.

, Wearing sheer layers doesn’t have to just be about showing skin. You can also wear sheer layers made out of different materials to add texture to your outfit. For example, you can wear a chiffon dress with a mesh long-sleeved shirt. Or, you could wear sheer material pants with a lace shirt.Not every material will style well together. For instance, a mesh jacket may not look good over a lace shirt.

, This works best if one layer is more translucent than the other layer. You could wear a very sheer short with a mesh or lace jacket over it. Or, you could wear very transparent pants with a shirt that does not show as much skin.Another option is to wear a sheer jacket with a sheer skirt over an opaque skirt.

, This is a more uncommon way of layering sheer clothing, but it is fashionable. You can wear tight shorts or leggings as the bottom layer. Any bottom layer that fits tightly will work. Then, wear the sheer pants of your choice. You could choose basic sheer pants, shimmery, lacy, or printed pants."

, There are a few ways that you can wear a sheer skirt. One modest way is to wear a loose and long sheer skirt over a tighter fitting opaque shirt. You can also wear a tight, sheer skirt with another tight opaque skirt that is of the same form and length as the top layer.

It is also an option to wear accents of sheer clothing. You can buy the clothing with small amounts of sheer material, or you can layer your clothing to only show parts of the sheer layer.Wear a long-sleeved sheer shirt and only allow the cuffs to show under the jacket.
Buy a shirt that only has a few parts of sheer fabric, or only has a layer of sheer material attached to the bottom of the shirt or sleeves.

, You can experiment with sheer fabric by wearing it as an accessory. For example, you could wear a sheer scarf with your outfit. A thin, chiffon scarf would work well with a light dress or pants and t-shirt. Another option is to wear a purse made at least partially out of sheer fabric.

You could also wear socks made out of a sheer material.

Start with a thin layer underneath.,
Put on thin, tight clothes.,
Add a vest or sweater.,
Get a good winter coat.,
Wear a hat.,
Keep your hands warm.,
Cover up the obvious holes in your wardrobe.,
Get the right shoes.",How to Stay Warm and Stylish During Winter," You’ll generally want clothes that are a bit looser on your body. These layers should help wick away any sweat or other moisture on the inside, which will keep you dry and warmer. If they are tight, they can get soaked in sweat, making them heavier.Longjohns and thermal underwear are good investments for areas that are harder to layer, like your legs, especially if the weather is going to be very cold.Plus, since they are all the way under your clothes, no one will ever have to see what they look like. Just make sure they fit well and aren’t too bulky.;
, This will be the first layer that people see, so look for a nice shirt or blouse in a professional environment, or other item that you would be comfortable having people look at you in. Just remember, the thinner and better fitting your clothes, the more you can potentially layer on.


You can also consider layering in reverse, that is putting thicker layers on first with loose thinner clothing on top. Wearing a t-shirt over a long-sleeve shirt or a skirt over pants can give some extra life to your warm-weather clothing.
Tights are a nice thin layer to wear closer to your skin, and they can generally fit under anything. They can also give extra life to clothes you might not be able to wear otherwise, like ripped jeans., The main job of this layer is to help provide further insulation and trap heat. This will likely be a visible layer, so look for something that matches your shirts and other wardrobe. A wool sweater can also be a nice addition for a more professional environment.These layers should be made of natural fibers like goose down and wool. This includes nicer wool fabrics like cashmere and angora. These are thicker materials that provide heat while not being too heavy.
Vests help cover and keep your torso warm, and can be a nice layer underneath a peacoat or other cold weather jacket. Because they don’t have any sleeves, you’ll also be able to move your arms around more easily., This is the one article of clothing you’ll always want to have in colder weather, no matter how many layers you wear, so it’s worth making an investment. There are many different types of winter coats out there, so you’ll have plenty of options to find something that suits you. Look for something thick, but also roomy enough that you’ll be able to layer underneath it.Look for different colors. If you are looking to stand out from the crowd, don’t stick with a more traditional black. Instead, find something bright and colorful, which will stand out from the drab crowd.You can even layer coats. Make sure that the inner jacket is slimmer and tighter fitting to prevent bulk. The outer coat should be larger and roomier, to account for the extra layers underneath., You lose a good deal of heat out of your head. Plus, it is also a sensitive part of the body, so you will really feel it when the temperature dips. Make sure you have something to keep your head warm and protect from the wind.


One good piece of headgear for style is a beanie. It covers your ears and the top of your head, while also keeping your face open for people to see. It’s hard to feel stylish when no one can see your face., You don’t want to keep your hands stuffed into your pockets at the only way to keep warm. Instead, keep them out by covering them with gloves or mittens. Either one can work, but are better for different situations. Mittens will keep your hands warmer because they hold your fingers together in a single pouch. On the other hand, gloves give you more freedom to move and use your fingers.Whichever you chose, you can always give your hands an extra boost with small hand warmers.
Like other outer layers, waterproof mittens or gloves are best, especially if you will be dealing with rain or snow. Dry hands are easier to keep warm.

, Don’t just think about large areas of exposed skin like your arms, legs, or neck. Consider the parts of your body where your regular layers end, like your neck and wrists. Look for clothing that is a bit longer to cover up more exposed areas.Wearing a scarf is a great and stylish way to keep your neck warm. A colorful or interesting pattern can help you stand out, and it doesn’t need to match the rest of your wardrobe in the same way. Don’t forget that there are a variety of ways to tie your scarf to vary your look, even with the same scarf., Your footwear should have some kind of tread. Winter is the season for ice, snow, and slush, and there is nothing stylish about slipping as you walk along. Boots are also thicker, and will help trap heat around your feet and ankles.For women, consider higher boots that come further up your legs. The extra coverage will give you the freedom to consider a shorter skirt, and provide a slightly different look than rain or snow boots."

Choose colors that are relaxed.,
Choose fabrics that are comfortable and yet sit well on your body.,
Go for t-shirts for the first layer.,
Choose loose but stylish jeans.,
If you'd prefer a dress, instead choose a longer style with flow and a romantic touch.

,
Find a comfortable fitted cardigan or sweater.,
Wear flat shoes.,
Choose jewelry that matches your clothing.,
Keep your hair relaxed in style.,
Add other items if you like them.",How to Put Together a Relaxed Wardrobe," Look for colors that suit you well but that fall within the relaxed range. Relaxed colors include beige, pastels, silver, deep blues and purples, greens and colors of the forest.;
, Silks, linen, tencel, cottons, wool and breathable fabrics are usually good clothes for relaxing in. Look for a nice flow and if you want comfort, elasticized waists or good fits.

, A fresh white t-shirt goes well with most color combinations. It's a good idea to own a few white t-shirts, so that you can stay relaxed and not spend all your time washing!


Other nice tops include baby doll, long flowing tops and transparent tops over a t-shirt or camisole.

, Tencel is an excellent fabric for comfort and neat style. Alternatively, choose white, beige or brown slacks in such fabrics as linen, Tencel or silk. Elasticized waists can be disguised with belts, scarves or over-length tops.


If you don't want to wear pants, choose long flowing skirts or dresses. Ones that feel luxurious and billow around your legs are lovely for relaxing.

,, Choose a contrasting color from the t-shirt.

, These are very relaxed and are easy to kick off for lazing around. Ballet flats are a common favorite for a chic relaxed look but other flats like sandals, sneakers, loafers, espadrilles or other styles of flats can work too.

, Don't overdo it; choose pieces that aren't too complicated. A simple silver bangle, a plain gold necklace, diamante drop earrings, etc. are good relaxed additions.

, No tight, pulled back styles. Wear hair either down or loosely added to a messy bun or ponytail; or try scrunching your hair for a day of pretty hair that says relaxed.

,


If you're adding a hat, make sure it's in keeping with the other items. Don't wear hats that are too fancy; a simple straw hat or a beanie are relaxed choices.
Scarves, especially flowing silk or similar ones create a relaxed and comfortable look.
Sunglasses are good for keeping relaxed during bright days instead of squinting.

Be creative as cupcakes!,
Be as bubbly as bubblegum!,
Be giggly as Snickers!,
Be Bold as Jolly Ranchers!,
Be sour as Skittles!,
Be daffy as Laffy Taffy!",How to Show Everyone How Much You Like Sweet Stuff1," Develop a love for sweets. Show people that you're into the sugary style. Do something like decorating a class project with drawings of cupcakes or jelly beans. You'll need to be able to draw well though, so you can make a good impression.;
, Know what it means to be ""bubbly"". A fun and vivacious person is irresistible, so you'll need to work on that. Act Perky and Be Quirky. Always be happy and playful, but don't overdo it or you'll come off as straight-up annoying. If you have a hard time perking up, think of something funny or positive. Also, skip. It may sound childish, but it displays your liveliness. Don't do it too often though.

, You don't know how far laughing will get you. Only laugh when the joke is funny, or you'll be the only one laughing. There may be some things that only you would find funny, and that's OK-- just laugh for a few seconds, then stop and say ""That's not funny."" Make sure to smile a lot. Make your pearly whites your favorite accessory. You should also have a good sense of humor. Know what's funny and what's not. The most important part of having a sense of humor is being able to laugh at yourself instead of other people.

, Don't care what other people think. Being sweet does not mean being a pushover. In most cases, ""I don't like you"" means ""I'm jealous of you"". What's the point of being around someone who doesn't appreciate your sugar high? If someone has insulted you, don't even entertain it--just act like you didn't hear it. Think of it like you're too cool to even respond to that person. Just keep your head up and keep walking.

, Keep in mind that being able to defend yourself is just as important as being able to walk away from danger. Don't start fights, but don't be afraid to get into one. Remember that your first weapon is your voice. (Example: What did you say?)

, Make funny faces, and try to be as entertaining as possible as long as you don't joke about the wrong stuff.

Think about your height.,
Evaluate your face type.,
Look at your neck.,
Use caution with pendant necklaces if you have a fuller figure.",How to Style a Pendant Necklace1," In general, pendants tend to work better on taller people. If you're below 5'4"", a pendant may look overwhelming. If you are on the shorter side, opt for a pendant necklace that sits above your collar bone. This way, it will add a touch of decoration to your outfit without overwhelming you.People of average or tall height can generally get away with a variety of different necklace sizes. If you want a longer pendant, one that goes below your collar bone, this can be flattering if you're average height or tall.
The size of the pendant itself does not make a big difference depending on height.;
, Different styles go better with round, oval, or heart-shaped faces. Look in a mirror and see if your face forms a circle, oval, or heart. Use this to decide which type of pendant would work best with you.Opt for a longer pendant if you have a round face, preferably one with a heavier charm. This will tug the chain downward, creating a v-effect.
Rounder faces would benefit from slightly shorter chains and lighter pendants. You want the chain to be rounded slightly to match your face.
If you have an oval face, you can wear any type of pendant.

, Shorter necks, or necks with lots of wrinkles, benefit from longer chains. Opt for a pendant necklace between 20 and 24 inches in length. Longer necks can generally wear any length of necklace., If you have a fuller figure, a pendant necklace may look awkward. It also may draw unnecessarily attention to your chest. Go for a smaller, less noticeable charm if you're fuller figured and want to wear a pendant necklace.For example, opt for a small orb rather than a large, decorative pendant. This may be more subtle, preventing unnecessary attention from being directed at your chest.

You can try getting a pendant that matches the color of your turtleneck and wearing it with that outfit.If you're shorter or fuller figured, remember to go with a smaller pendant.

, Pendants usually look good when worn outside t-shirts. Plain t-shirts especially can be spruced up with the presence of a decorative pendant just outside the shirt. This is a simple, minimal look that can be flattering on most people., Some people prefer a pendent on bare skin. If you prefer this, opt to wear a pendant with a v-neck. Be careful, however, to make sure the chain is not too long. A longer chain may need to be paired with a very low-cut v-neck, or a plunging neckline, to get the desired effect., If you're wearing a solid colored top, especially a darker color, this can go great with orbs or pearls. Opt for pendant necklaces that contain these kinds of jewelry. This will brighten up your outfit by adding a splash of dramatic color.Lighter pearls and orbs may work better on darker tops.
For example, you can wear a clear or milky orb with a black turtleneck.

, A jeans and t-shirt may feel very casual. If you want to add a touch of decoration to casual attire, wear a pendant. Aim for a fancier pendant, such as one that uses jewels, over something like a tag or chain.For example, do not wear a dog tag pendant with a formal dress. Instead, opt for a stylish orb pendant that is encrusted with jewels.

Try wearing more than one pendant.",How to Style a Pendant Necklace3," Pendants are fairly dramatic as a piece of jewelry. Due to their length and size, they tend to draw a lot of attention. If you're wearing a pendant, be careful about styling it with accessories. Keep other jewelry and accessories minimal.For example, do not wear big, dangly earrings with a pendant necklace. Instead, opt for small bulb earrings.
You can also wear something like a delicate bracelet, a small ring, or a wristwatch.

, People often double up on the necklaces when wearing pendants. Due to the length of a pendant necklace, it can be easy to wear it with other shorter necklaces. For example, pair a pendant necklace with a choker.However, as pendants can often be flashy, you should choose played down necklaces to pair with them. Go for a solid colored choker, for example, instead of one with a lot of jewels and embellishments.

, If you want a busier look, try pairing one pendant with another. You can wear one long pendant and then add a shorter pendant above it.Stick to somewhat minimalistic pendants for this look to avoid looking too showy.

Accent the neckline with a belt.",How to Style a High Neckline," Because a high neckline often has a severe look, it’s best to opt for a shirt or dress with details that help soften it. A high neckline top or dress with lace or crochet detailing can be very flattering.Embroidered details can also help balance the more structured look of a high neckline.;
, Tops and dresses made of delicate fabrics tend to have a softer look that balances the higher neckline. Look for high neck blouses and dresses in materials such as silk, chiffon, rayon, or cotton voile.A sheer dress or blouse with high neck is another delicate option that can soften the severe look of the high neckline.

, With a high neckline, it helps to make sure that the cut of the rest of the top balances it out. Wearing a midi or cropped high neckline top that hits at your waist or a little above your waist can provide a flattering, balanced look.If you aren’t a fan of cropped tops, choose a snug high neck top that you can tuck into your pants, skirt, or shorts for a similar effect.

, If you’re worried about a top or dress with a high neckline looking frumpy or old-fashioned, choose a style that features cutouts. In particular, look for a top with cutouts near the neck to help counter the more severe neckline.A high neck top with cutouts is a good option for the summer when you may want to be a little cooler.
For a sexier look, select a high neck top or dress with cutouts near the decolletage. The sliver of skin will help counter the higher neckline.

, If you're worried about your high neck top or dress looking too dowdy, the sleeve length can make a major difference. Long sleeves with a high neckline can be difficult to pull off, but a sleeveless style can balance the higher neckline for a more modern look. A short sleeve top or dress can also be flattering.

If you prefer longer sleeves, opt for a high neckline shirt or dress with sleeves that hit at the elbow instead of the wrist.
For a stylish long sleeve, high neckline item, choose one with cutouts. You can even find styles that have cutouts on the arm to help balance the neckline.

, It’s a good idea to pair a high neckline top with bottoms that have a high-waist. That helps accentuate your waistline and create a balanced look for your torso.If you’ve been leery of wearing a high-waisted skirt or pair of pants or shorts, they’re actually flattering on all body types. They elongate the legs, hide a muffin top, and make your backside appear smaller.
When you’re wearing high-waisted bottoms, it’s important to get the right size. If they’re too tight, it’s an unflattering look. If they’re too loose, they can add bulk to your midsection.

, In addition to choosing high-waisted bottoms, you may want to think about going short when you’re wearing a high neckline top. Pairing it with shorts or a skirt exposes some skin that helps balance the more severe look on top.To keep your look balanced, don’t choose shorts or skirts that are too short. Look for styles that hit between mid-thigh and the knee for the most flattering look.
You can wear your high neckline top with shorts and skirts even in the winter. Just add a pair of tights in an interesting color or texture.

, When you want your high neckline top to have a relaxed look, pair with denim bottoms. Your favorite pair of jeans or a denim mini or knee-length skirt can give you a chic casual look for everyday.If you really want a top with a high neck to feel fresh, modern, and relaxed, wear it with denim cutoffs for a perfect summer weekend look.

, If you want to wear your high neck top to the office or out to dinner, choose a tailored bottom to pair it with. A streamlined pencil skirt or a slim-fitting pair of trousers in wool or herringbone can instantly dress up any high neck top.You can also find tailored shorts if you want a formal look for your top that still feels playful.

, If you’re wearing a top with a high neckline, you want to wear your hair in a way that showcases your neck. Pull your hair up into a ponytail or a topknot for a more dramatic look. For a softer feel, wear your hair in a bun at the nape of your neck.If you don’t want to wear your hair completely up, go for a half up half down style. That will keep the hair out of your face, so the neckline is more visible.

, If you want to wear a necklace with a high neckline, it’s best to choose a long style that hits between the chest and the waist. That will draw attention downward to balance the higher neck.With a high neckline, you may want to skip a necklace entirely. The neckline detail may add enough visual interest to your outfit that a necklace isn’t necessary.

, A high neckline draws attention to your face, so you can maintain the focus by wearing it with dangling earrings. A style that ends right at the top of the neckline is the especially flattering.If you have a long face, stay away from straight dangling earrings. Instead, opt for a pair of hoops or dangling earrings with round pendants.

, You can give your high neckline top a more polished look by wearing a belt with your outfit. Tuck your top into the bottoms of your choice, and add a belt at your waistline, which will help define the area so your torso appears balanced.For the most balanced look, choose a belt that’s approximately 1 ½-inches (4-cm) wide. That’s the most flattering width for both short- and long-waisted figures.

Check the height of your boots.,
Check the heel label for the proper font.,
Check where the shoes were made.,
Observe the box your boots came in.,
Check the label on the box.,
Check your boots for a hanging tag.,
Feel the fur inside the boots.,
Bend the sole of your boot.,
Look at the security labels.",How to Spot Fake Ugg Boots," Fake boots are taller than real pairs; you might only be able to tell this if you have a real pair to compare them to, so either hold an old pair next to this new pair, or compare images online. Real boots have a 11 ¾ inch (29.845 cm) shaft height, and fake boots can be up to 2 inches (5.08 cm) taller.The opening of your boots should be wide enough to fold down. If the opening is narrow, your UGG boots are most likely imitations.;
, If the font is large and stylized incorrectly, you will know the boots are knockoffs. The threads on the label of fake UGG boots will be mismatched and asymmetrical. The label on fake boots will be wide and sloppily stitched.

, Real UGG boots are made in China, not in Australia, as many fake boots will claim. This should be displayed clearly on the label. Also check for the registered trademark mark (R) on the boots’ soles., Fake UGGs will come in bulky boxes that are hinged and have handles. They will also use different artwork on their boxes. Real UGG boots will be delivered in a cardboard box with a lid, displaying the sun logo on the front and the company name: “UGG AUSTRALIA” printed on its side.Real UGG boots will come in a thick wrapping paper with “UGG AUSTRALIA” printed on it.

, Real labels display a picture of the product, and the top half of the barcode is colored. Fake labels may state that the boots were made in New Zealand or Australia, and will have a completely black-and-white barcode.

, Hanging tags are not used on real UGG products. If you notice a tag, the boots are almost certainly fake. Australian flags displayed on the packaging also indicates that the UGGs are fake., Synthetic fur is slippery, silky, and even feels fake. Real UGG boots use fur that is a bit rougher to the touch. The fur should be a creamy color with a thick texture. Counterfeit boots have grey-colored, thin, synthetic fur on the inside that cannot be seen from the top opening. There is a layer of foam between the inner and outer lining of the boot., Real UGG boots are easy to bend and walk in, while fake ones are stiff and unyielding. Gently try to move the sole of your boot to see how flexible it is; if it is difficult to move, the boots may be fake., Check the foil strip on the label behind the shoe size and the materials label on the left boot. If there isn’t a sewn-in-label, there should be a security sticker on the sole of the left shoe. Turn your boot over to see the holographic UGG label with a sun symbol. If the boots are real, when you turn the boot 90 degrees, it will change from black to white."

Often they smell musty or are dusty, so if you have allergies, be sure to spend only short amounts of time visiting. Also, you won't always find an item in your size. You won't always find something you like, either. If you are someone who loves to rummage, would sacrifice a half day in pursuit of a bargain and enjoys the thrill of the hunt as much as the kill, then thrift store shopping is for you! You must have perseverance, determination, patience and grit.;
, You need at least a spare hour, maybe two. Since rummaging requires energy, choose the time of day when you feel strong and energetic. Some stores are open at night or weekends. Nights are good because fewer people go then. Weekends are likely to be busier. Sales days are the busiest.

, It can help to get another opinion and you'll be less likely to leave the store with something that looks awful, or something that you don't actually like. If you're having absolutely no luck, it's good to have a friend along so you can show them all the humorously horrible things you find.

, There are two ways to shop. The first is that you have come with an object in mind, for example, a pair of jeans. So head straight to the area where the jeans are and look with that in mind alone.

, In this case, start at the beginning. It is always wise to choose one type of thing though - for example, focus on clothes rather than also trying to look at the books, china, toys and bikes etc. Unless the store is tiny, you'll wear yourself out and possibly over-buy.

, This makes it easier for you to avoid colors that you don't like and not waste extra time. If the clothes are hanging up, it is easier to spot items. Learn to look for a. color; b. texture and c. style. If they're in a heap, dig in and pull!

, This takes care of the need to pull out every item.

, Texture is really important - you should become familiar by eyesight with high quality fabrics and knits such as high quality cotton, cashmere, linen, silk, natural fabrics etc so that you focus on these. Avoid items that are all synthetic (except for serious outdoor clothing, or if you're looking for something that won't wrinkle in a suitcase) - that is probably why they're in the store in the first place. Look for classic styles which don't date easily.

, Do you really like the style overall - the arms shape, the leg flare, the neck plunge etc? Is it really your color? Will it match with clothes you already own? Also be honest with yourself about whether you would really make any alterations or repairs necessary before you would wear it -- if you're not likely to get out the sewing machine or pay a tailor, stick with items that already work!

, Do pants have a shiny seat, are beads or buttons missing? If you see these, ask yourself if are they easily reparable or are they so damaged that the rag bag would be a better place for these clothes? In general, only get items in good condition or capable of an easy repair. And never buy anything with perspiration stains - they just will not come out. Remember that buttons are not a problem - you can easily replace lost ones with better ones.

, As mentioned above, some repairs, alterations, or cleanings are relatively simple. If you are handy with a sewing machine, shortening a hemline is no big deal. If a white shirt has a stain, time to get out the bleach. A tailor can have it altered or cleaned and you will still end up being a lot less than purchasing it brand new or from a consignment store.

, Many changing areas only permit 3 items at a time (something that is a bit hard when you have a cartload of goodies!) or they are so open as to be almost immodest. A good trick is wear clothes that enable you to try the items on over the top. A good set is a leotard or swim suit with a little t-shirt and short flared skirt. Slip-on shoes are essential.

, If there is no mirror, you take the risk but given the price, it'll probably be a cheap risk!

, Sometimes items donated by the same individual of your taste and size will be close together on the rack. Maybe match some items together with the ones you already have.

, If you have coupons, be sure to use them.

, You can't be sure they're really clean. Check pockets before cleaning--you could be pleasantly surprised by forgotten money!

, Second-hand is no longer second-best; it is about sharing wants & needs with others around the world.

Make money through websites and apps specific to clothing sale.,
Post on a general sale app or website.,
Sell on social media.",How to Sell Used Clothing1," There are many different websites and apps out there that have each developed their own unique way of buying and selling used clothing. Some of these have you take photos of your clothing while others have you ship them your clothes.


Generally, these websites keep a portion of your sales and pay you by either sending you a check, giving you a gift card, or through an online payment company like PayPal.
Some of these websites include: thredUP, Poshmark, Tradesy, and refashioned.;
, Selling on one of these sites is a little different because it is a bit more DIY. Typically, you post of photo of the clothing item you want to sell, choose a price you want to sell it for, and write a description of it. Another difference is that this way is a bit more independent, so you usually get to keep every cent of what purchasers buy for.


Remember to include item, size, price and condition in your post to improve your chances of sale.Craigslist, eBay, and Let go are all websites and apps you can use to sell clothes, shoes, and much more.
Using this method, you are in direct communication with potential buyers and can arrange to meet up with them to exchange money and merchandise or ship the item to them., This is nearly identical to selling on a general sale website, except you sell to a more limited group of people. If you have a lot friends on social media, you might be more successful using this method.


Many people sell clothes on Instagram simply by using the “#shop my closet” hashtag. People make their bids in comments below the photo.You can also sell your clothes on Facebook by joining different groups. To find these groups, just search keywords, such as brands, in the search bar at the top of the page. Each group has an administrator and rules specific to the group, so make sure to read those before buying and selling."

Sell to a local second hand store.,
Earn commission through consignment.,
Hold a yard sale.,
Donate for a tax break.",How to Sell Used Clothing2," Do some research online and make a list of second hand stores in your area that will purchase gently used clothing. Then, contact the stores and learn about their policies, rates, and what particular clothing items they currently need. There are many places that will sort through your clothes during an appointment and give you immediate cash for whatever items they want., Take your clothes to a local consignment store. They’ll choose which of your clothing items to sell, and if your items get purchased, the store will reimburse you for your percentage of the sale price.


On average, stores will charge you between 25% and 60% commission., Holding a sale at your home is a good option if you have more than just clothes to sell. Other items, such as sporting goods and electronics, are typically more popular at yard sales, but you can still make a little bit of cash from selling your clothes this way., If you don’t want the drama of seeing sales through, handling shipping, or driving around town from store to store, you can donate your clothes. Donating to stores like Goodwill will at least get you a tax break if the sum total of your donation is worth enough."
"
Make any necessary repairs.,
Clean your clothes.,
Hang up your clothes or fold them and put them into bags.",How to Sell Used Clothing3," Stains, holes, missing buttons, and rips will not get your items sold regardless of how fantastic they are. Buyers look for clothing in new and like-new condition. Most stores are not interested in selling ripped clothing.

, Properly wash, dry, and iron your clothes before you post a photo of them or bring them to a second-hand store. Wrinkled, dirty clothing suggests that you haven’t taken great care of your clothing, and drives down the estimated value., Which of these you do depends on how you decide to sell your clothes. Often, second-hand stores that give you cash on the spot will prefer your clothes be nicely folded in a bag, while consignment stores may want them pressed and on a hanger when you bring them in. Call or look on the company’s website to make sure that you’re adhering to their guidelines.

Decide or scout for stores that are having clearances or sales.,
Plan for a long day because, chances are, you are not the only shopper going bargain hunting.

,
Leave really early.,
Consider the season.,
Obviously, the best shopping days of the year are the day after Thanksgiving and the day after Christmas.,
Save those coupons!,
Every once in a while, a store will have a sale.,
When a store closes, they have major sales.,
Give Goodwill a try.,
Cheat and go early.",How to Shop During Sales and Clearances,";
,, As we all know, ""the early bird gets the worm."", For example, early fall or late summer is the best time to buy swim suits. Stores will have loads of suits that they will have to store over the winter, taking up space. They will often mark down seasonal things like this after the time when they are most popular.

, But if you don't want to deal with the crowds taking what you want, go a few days after Christmas/Thanksgiving. Often, the things will still be on sale, and there will be less people. Also, go after less important holidays. Sales end then!

, You know those little things that come in the mail, for a free pizza or a 60% off coupon? Save those! If it's a store you never go to, you can give them to other people or try to make a special trip. Those coupons add up after awhile!

, Labor Day Sale, Presidents' Day Sale, stores love to put things on sale! But consider this. Instead of going to that store during the sale, go after the sale. Often, the item will be on clearance where you can get it up to half the sale price. Stores figure that if you are not going to buy it during the sale, you're never going to buy it. So they put it on clearance. Use this to your advantage.

, Which, of course, is a great thing! They try to get rid of the things that they have because no one wants to be stuck with it after the store closes. After it's already closed, often you can go to stores like Goodwill and purchase clothes from the store.

, You may be thinking ""Ew... second hand clothes!"" Well, not necessarily. Often stores like Aeropostale and Hollister give Goodwill the clothes that they don't sell. You'd be surprised, a lot of the things at Goodwill still have the price tag on them!

, For some stores that are open for 24 hours, like Walmart, their sales won't start until a certain time. If the sale time starts at 5:00 AM, go at 3:00 AM, do all of your shopping and then check out at 5:00 AM, when the sales have been enacted.

However, those same items may be out of style next fall. Instead, spend the majority of what you do have on items that are stylish, yet not so trendy that they'll quickly go out of style.For instance, some things never go out of style, like a wool pencil skirt. Stick to quality items made from long-lasting materials, like wool. They may cost a bit more this year, but they'll last longer than more cheaply made items.
When thinking about what constitutes a staple for you, think about where you spend the most time. For instance, if you spend more time at a professional job, your staples might include professional skirts or suits. If you work from home, your staples will be much more casual.;
, While you do want higher quality items, you can find these items at discount stores that specialize in selling the remainders of items, such as Ross Dress for Less or TJ Maxx. You can find high quality clothing that won't break the bank.

, While shopping online can be risky as far as getting clothes that fit, if you know your sizes in certain brands, shopping online can save you money. You can compare prices at different stores to see which one will save you the most money. However, don't forget to add in shipping costs, as those can add up quickly., Of course, you'll find a lot of junk at thrift stores. However, among all the junk, you'll also find some high quality pieces for a steal. You can even find high-end brands if you search regularly. Look for closely woven, long-lasting fabric, such as wool or linen., While you may not want to buy this year's fall trends at end-of-season sales, you can find solid staples for a lot less than you'd pay at the beginning of fall. This year's trends may not be in style next year, but the staples will., Sometimes, you can find better deals in another section of the store, such as in the men's section if you're a woman. You may even find deals in the children's section if you're petite. You can still get solid staples, but they may be a lot less, depending on where you shop., That is, just because a piece of clothing is seasonal, that doesn't mean you should buy it. When trying on items, consider your comfort level with it. Ask yourself if you'll actually get it out and wear it. If you won't, there's no sense in buying it., One way to incorporate trends inexpensively is to use accessories to give a nod to what's trendy. For instance, if plaids are in season, purchase a plaid scarf to add to your wardrobe, rather than a coat or blouse, as the scarf will likely cost you less., Most stores are going to put their more expensive pieces up front, so you'll see them as soon as you walk in and want to buy them. However, if you walk past them, you'll likely find better deals in the back, particularly on the clearance rack., While it can be tempting to keep hitting the stores, sticking to one shopping trip each season can actually save you money. That is, when you spread out your shopping, you'll likely spend more than you intend, while when you limit yourself to one major shopping trip each season, you may find it easier to stay under budget., If you have an old blouse or dress that you feel like has become a bit boring, try jazzing it up a bit. A brooch or a new pair of cuff links may be all you need. Try something with a bit of sparkle, or for a more fall-like flair, try a leather pieces in jewel tones. Pin it on anywhere you like, but try pinning it in a central location on v-neck or over to the side on other types of shirts., A belt is also a great way to refresh a piece of clothing that's been in your closet a while. Try throwing a leather belt over a long sweater, for instance, or use one to add visual interest to a fall-style poncho. You can also use a rustic leather belt with a pair of wool pants to give them a fall flair., Sometimes, all it takes to give your wardrobe a new look is to try new combinations you haven't put together before. Get out all your fall clothes, and try different tops with different bottoms. Add different accessories, or throw in a different scarf. You'd surprised how different your wardrobe can look with just a few changes., One trend that stays in fashion is making your jeans your own. If you're tired of looking at the same pair of jeans, try changing them up by adding slashes along the knee. Another option is to use patches to create a look that's singularly yours. Plus, patches can mend minor holes that may have kept you from wearing some jeans.You don't need to limit this technique to jeans. For instance, you can cut off the bottom of a sweatshirt to create a cropped sweatshirt., Get together with a group of friends to swap clothes. You may be tired of a sweater, but your friend may find it's their new favorite piece. The best part is, it's free for everyone involved, and you all get new clothes.You may want to lay a few ground rules, such as how many pieces each person is required to bring. You may also want to be sure that everyone has someone to swap with, size-wise, or try limiting it to accessories only.
Another option is to borrow items from friends, while you loan other pieces. You still get to try new pieces, but you don't have to give up ones you love permanently. The fall is a great time to exchange pieces like sweaters and scarves."

Tuck the saree in your waist.,
Pleat the saree by tucking it back and forth.,
Fold the remaining saree to make pleats.,
Throw the folded section over your left shoulder.,
Ornament the other hanging end of the saree.,
Position the decorated corner of the saree.",How to Wear a Saree in Bengali Style," Start the tuck on the right side of your waist, and wrap it all the way around your body until it comes back to the right side of your body. As the edge runs along your waist, you can gently tuck in the entire edge, so the saree has a secure fit.


The bottom border of the saree should graze the top of your feet, and should look horizontally straight and parallel to the ground.;
, Once you have wrapped the saree once around your waist and tucked it on your right side hip, take the continued edge of the cloth, and tuck it into the left side of your waist. Then, reverse the direction, folding the saree back on itself from the left, and tuck it again on the right side of your waist. Moving from the right tuck, bring the cloth back across the front of your waist, and tuck it again on the left side. Do this one more time, moving from the left tuck, and tuck it again on your right side waist.


This back and forth folding is called box pleating the saree. When you are finished pleating the saree, the fabric should lay evenly and perpendicular to your body.
Overall, after the initial full body wrap, you will tuck the saree twice on your left side and twice on your right side., Pick the saree up from the shorter edge (the end that is not coming directly from the tucked portion), and hold it vertically at the corner. Start folding the saree in 4-5 inch sections, folding and layering the saree back and forth using your thumb and pinky finger to hold the fabric in place. Be careful to take your time and make clean, even folds.


Make sure that the ends of the folds finish on opposite sides of the pleat. For example, if the beginning, top corner of the pleat starts on the right side, then the end, bottom corner of the folding should finish on the left side., The end of the saree is called a pallu. The folded pallu will now be thicker since it’s folded. Position the pallu over your left shoulder, pulling up from the front, bottom part of the saree so the pallu can be completely draped over your shoulder. The bottom of the pallu behind your shoulder should fall somewhere in between mid calf to lower calf length.Make adjustments so that the decorated bordering of the saree is fully visible and relatively straight and vertical.

, From the pallu hanging behind your back, grab the corner of the top fold. This corner is the corner facing outward, shown to the world, not the corner facing your back. Pull this corner from the left side of your body, to the right side, and bring it underneath your right arm, so it is now in front of your body. Attach a trinket to this corner of the saree. You can use a safety pin to securely attach the trinket to cornered pallu.


Traditionally, the trinket has been a heavy house key, but any kind of weighted decoration will do., Once you have attached your trinket, and the decorated corner is in front of the right side of your body, drape it over your right shoulder. The trinket should fall at around the top to mid portion of your back.

Mix your henna powder into a paste one day before you plan to use it.,
Put henna powder into bowl.,
Mix ¼ cup acidic liquid into 20g henna powder until smooth.,
Add 1.5teaspoons (tsp) sugar to your henna mixture.,
Add 1.5tsp of an essential oil to your henna mixture.,
Make sure your henna mixture is smooth.,
Use your henna mixture!",How to Make Henna1," There is a wide variety of different henna powders for sale. You want to get the most natural and fresh powder available to obtain the deepest stain.Henna only deposits a red dye on skin or hair. Powders that are advertised as “black henna” or “blonde henna” have other chemicals added to them. You’ll want to avoid these formulations.Fresh henna powder smells like recently cut hay or spinach. It ranges from green or khaki in color.A good rule of thumb is that the brighter the powder, the fresher it is.Powders that are less fresh will cause your henna to develop less intensely.These powders may appear brownish and have little or no scent.;
, Before you can make a henna paste for use at home, you’ll need to purchase henna powder. Buying from a reputable vendor either online or in a store is the best way to guarantee you get the most natural and fresh powder.You can purchase your henna powder online with reputable henna suppliers including Mehandi and Temptu Marketing.You can also purchase your henna powder in specialty stores. Again, you’ll want to choose a reputable henna supplier, such as a trusted importer or import store, or even someone who has a henna art business.Avoid purchasing henna in grocery stores or health food stores. They often have older powders that are not the purest form of henna., Once you’ve purchased a quality henna powder, you’ll need to gather a few additional supplies, including a bowl and an acidic liquid, to make a paste for use.You need the following supplies to start: a bowl, preferably in plastic so it doesn’t react with the henna; a mixing spoon or spatula; an acidic liquid like lemon juice or apple cider vinegar; sugar; and an essential oil like lavender or tea tree.Store your henna powder in a dry and airtight container in a location that isn’t very warm. Henna is light and heat sensitive, so this will assure that your henna powder stays as fresh as possible., To make henna paste for application to either body or hair, mix your henna powder and gathered supplies together.


It takes approximately one day for the henna paste to release its dye. Waiting this long will ensure you get the most vivid color., Put your dry henna powder into a small plastic or glass bowl.


Start with a small amount of henna powder, anywhere from 20grams to 100grams.Twenty grams of powder will produce about three ounces of paste.It’s best to use either a plastic or glass bowl. This is because other materials such as metal or wood could react with the henna., Mixing your henna powder with an acidic liquid, such as lemon juice or apple cider vinegar, until it is smooth assures that the henna powder releases its dye most effectively.If you are using more than 20g henna powder, adjust your acidic liquid accordingly. For example, you would mix 1 ¼ cups acidic liquid to 100grams henna powder.
You can use any kind of acidic liquid including lemon juice, lime juice, orange or grapefruit juice, or even apple cider vinegar. Lemon juice, however, is the preferred acidic liquid.Avoid using neutral liquids such as water, or other kinds of liquids including coffee or tea. These liquids will not render the most intense color from the henna.If you are using fresh juice, make sure to strain out any pulp so it doesn’t end up in your mixture.
Make sure your mixture is smooth. If you notice that it is lumpy or has bits of dry powder, add small amounts of your acidic liquid until you reach the consistency of a smooth yogurt., A small amount of sugar in your henna mixture will help it adhere to your skin better and retain moisture.If you began with more than 20g henna powder, you’ll want to adjust how many teaspoons sugar you are using in the mixture. For example, if you are using 100g henna powder, increase to 7.5tsp sugar.
Sugar will help your mixture be not only smooth, but also help it from drying out quickly since sugar draws in moisture., Using an essential oil in your mixture will not only help you get the most intense color, but the oil will also make it smell good.You can use many different kinds of essential oil for your mixture, including lavender, cajeput, or tea tree oil.Avoid using essential oils such as mustard or clove because they can harm you., Once you’ve added all of your ingredients, stir the entire mixture again to assure that it is as smooth as possible.


Cover with plastic wrap and let sit for 24 hours. When the henna mixture is smooth, covering it and allowing it to sit for about one day will assure that the henna renders the best color. Put the plastic wrap directly against the paste surface to make sure there are no air pockets. This will also keep it from drying out too quickly.Let the bowl sit in a warm, dry place. The temperature should be between 75 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit.If you’re using a clear bowl, you’ll notice that the henna mixture slowly begins to release its dye. This will appear as a dark band within the mixture., After about a day, your henna mixture has released its dye and is ready to use either on your hair or body.

, If you are using fresh leaves to make henna, you’ll need to first dry them in the sun so they can be turned into a powder.The leaves are dry when they have a crisp consistency, like a potato chip., By removing any branches and twigs from the dried henna leaves, you assure that your henna will render the purest and most intense color., In order to turn your dried leaves into henna, you’ll first need to make a powder out of them by pulsing them either in a blender or a mixer.Blend and pulse your leaves until they are a fine powder. This will ensure that your henna isn’t fibrous and help your final henna paste mixture be smooth., You don’t want to expose your henna powder to any liquid until you’re ready to use it.

Consider the weather during the time of the year you will be visiting.,
Pack clothing that is practical based on your plans.,
Leave the workout clothes at home.,
Know that black is always in style.,
Keep everything simple.,
But don't be afraid to accessorize!,
Keep your belongings safe.,
Participate in Paris's fashionable culture by putting together creative outfits.,
Draw from the locals.,
Keep your hair and make-up minimally styled.,
Bring your umbrella!",How to Dress in Paris," Though Paris doesn't experience extreme temperatures by any stretch of the imagination, you'll be glad you're dressed for the occasion -- especially if you're spending hours upon hours outside.


Average temperatures are 5 degrees Celsius (41 degrees Fahrenheit) during the winter, and 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit) during summer. Clothing that can be easily layered is ideal for any time of the year, since nights are often cool during warm months, and sunny days can heat up even during winter.
Spring is the driest season. Showers during all other seasons are frequent but short, and they often occur without warning. Significant winter snowfalls are rare, but not unheard of. Many Parisians carry umbrellas at all times, and many visitors during winter months pack boots in case of snow.;
, You'll need a comfortable pair of shoes (not your tennis shoes! Think dressier) at the very least. If your idea of Paris is tea rooms and shopping down the Champs-Élysées, you'll need to pack a little differently than if you'll be jogging up le Tour Eiffel. What's on your itinerary?


Business attire is appropriate if you are traveling for work. Dark-colored suits are common for men and women, and women also wear conservative, neutral-toned dresses.
Sightseers should dress comfortably, since touring Paris involves a great deal of walking. It is important to keep in mind that the French tend to dress more formally than others for everyday activities. Khakis, button-down shirts, sundresses, designer jeans, skirts and sweaters are common on the streets of Paris during the day. Forgo tennis shoes for comfortable loafers or sandals. Dresses and jackets are appropriate for evening dining.

, Or at least in your hotel! If you put a woman in sweats and a woman in a miniskirt, Paris just might be the only city where it's the woman in sweats that's getting stared at. If you're hitting the streets (especially at night -- during the day is a bit more lax), leave the leisure wear to the Americans.


Paris is about fabric and fit. There are no sweatpants that are about fabric and fit. Same for shoes -- those tennis shoes of yours don't really match anything. They definitely won't blend in at the bistros and discotheques you plan on hitting up!

, Seriously. It's slimming and it's classy and it hides stains? Wonderful. It can be donned any time of year, too. Just jazz it up with some jewelry or a scarf (definitely a scarf!) if you're looking for a pop of color.


Neutrals are always a safe bet. Black, tan, navy, brown, white, beige, grey -- it's all good. Not to mention packing mostly neutrals means you can combine everything in your bag for maximum outfit potential. Everything matches!

, Parisians know that loud and eye-popping is basically the opposite of classy and sophisticated. Whatever you're wearing, keep it simple. No logos on your bag (and a tote, messenger bag, or handbag is okay), no rock band tees, just a plain button-down with some dark slacks. Timeless, really.


Some might describe Paris as ""unisex"" and that wouldn't be far off from the truth. While women and men obviously differ in their styles, there are a lot of commonalities. They both can often be found in sweaters, jackets, and plain tees with slacks, dark denims and boots or sandals. The staples are all the same basic, understated pieces.

, Even though black and simple are two key points to dressing well in Paris, it doesn't mean you should be in your funeral best. With those black slacks and that cream top, throw on a scarf, jacket, a necklace and some bracelets. Chunky and dainty combined!


Scarves are all the rage -- Parisians know the small addition can take a dull outfit and bring it all together. If you don't have any that you like for what you're packing, it's not hard to find them lining the streets!

, Crime in Paris is a thing, especially in certain areas. Have something to keep your money, ID, phone, camera, or other valuables in that can't be easily taken from you. Don't store your items in your back pocket or in an open purse. It's basically asking for it.

, Let the origin of haute couture inspire you. Take your pieces and put them together in ways you haven't before. Paris has truly seen it all, so go out there with your head held high, whatever you're wearing.


Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world. It is not uncommon to see people in daring, attention-grabbing outfits. If you're looking for a place to go out dancing in spiky heels or a feather boa, Paris is an appropriate location.
A wardrobe full of name brands might make you feel more at home among some of the world's most fashionable, but it certainly isn't essential. As long as your clothes are flattering, well taken care of and stylish, you will fit in among the Parisians.

, As you go out and about, be observant. You'll probably see a bit of everything -- just because they're Parisian (assuming they are) doesn't mean they're not also a whole bunch of other things. How do they infuse their own styles into their outfits? What can you learn from them?


You'll see women wearing floor-length skirts, you'll see men wearing leather jackets, you'll see denim despite it's poor rep. You'll see hipsters, you'll see boho-chic, but somehow it all still seems so French. Tune into the differences and pinpoint what appeals to you.

, One of the best things about French culture is that its beauty is real. Women throw up their hair into a bun in seconds and call it a day. Everyone takes advantage of their natural beauty instead of covering it up. So spend five minutes in the morning running a comb through you hair, throw on some blush, maybe some mascara, and go out the door. You're ready!


Men, it's important to be well-groomed, but you by no means have to look like you're ready to hit the runway. Keep the facial hair to a minimum and be aware if you're rocking bedhead or not. Yep, it's really that easy.

, Even if it's sunny out now, Parisian skies are known to be tricky. So bring your umbrella or go stop at some corner shop and spend a few Euros on a cheap one to last the rest of the week. You'll be glad you're not soaked to the brim when it does rain!

Browse online shops for a velvet dress you like.,
Slip on some cowboy boots or sandals.,
Add some brass or stone jewelry to your outfit.,
Wear your favorite blazer or light jacket on top.,
Avoid tights with sheen or strappy heels.",How to Wear Velvet Casually1," Dresses are one of the easiest ways to wear velvet. Not only are velvet dresses available at numerous trendy clothing shops in many different cuts and styles, but they’re also easy to dress down with accessories and accent pieces. Any cut will work for your casual velvet look, but slip dresses and short-sleeved dresses can be particularly easy to accessorize casually.You also might want to avoid plunging necklines, exposed shoulders, or long skirts, as these cuts can read as formal.
If you’re having a hard time finding a dress you like, check out mass, internationally available retailers such as boohoo, Forever21, or ASOS.;
, Footwear can set the tone for an entire outfit and switch a night-look into a day-look in one fell swoop. To do so, grab your favorite, worn-in pair of cowboy boots or some basic, no-frills sandals. Brown or black matte-finish leather in particular will immediately make a dress more casual.For an edgier but still daytime look, pair your velvet dress with combat boots or some studded booties.
For example, pair a short velvet slip dress with some black combat boots or a pair of colorful ballet flats. Alternatively, take a burgundy or hunter green short-sleeved velvet dress and add some light brown cowboy boots to play down the rich, jewel tones of the dress.

, Like shoes, jewelry can dress an outfit up or down. Rhinestones, diamonds, shiny gold, and pearls will make your dress look fancier, while brassy, coppery, or turquoise stones will make it more relaxed. In general, you want your jewelry to complement your velvet dress rather than compete with it, so avoid statement jewelry with sparkles or glossy finishes.


Stud earrings, cuff bracelets, and long pendant necklaces in brassy tones are all excellent options to dress your velvet piece down while still making you look put-together.

, If you’re still feeling overly formal in your velvet dress, toss a light jacket over it. This addition will break up the solid velvet, as well as add visual interest and structure to the overall look.


Leather or bomber jackets are perfect for a casual day out with your friends, while a fitted blazer is a great, ever-appropriate look for the office or other professional events., Tights and strappy shoes can work wonderfully with a casual velvet look, but you should be careful which bottom-half accessories you use. Shiny, sheer tights will slant your velvet dress toward a nighttime look, as will stiletto or chunky heels with lots of straps or ties. Opt instead for opaque sweater tights and flat gladiator sandals.


Also keep your purse or bag in mind! An embossed or shiny clutch will make your dress look more formal, whereas brown, slouchy hobo bags will dress it down.

"
"
Choose the right jacket.,
Look for fabrics with different, subtle textures.,
Wear a casual tank top or sweater under the blazer.,
Slip on a pair of dark-rinse jeans.,
Wear flat boots, wedges, or chunky-heeled booties.",How to Wear Velvet Casually2," A velvet blazer is a timeless look that you can wear well after the velvet-revival trend has passed. Some cuts and colors will be more versatile than others, though. Jewel tones like deep reds and blues look gorgeous in velvet and carry the added bonus of transitioning seamlessly from day to night.A form-fitting, structured blazer is most versatile as far as cut goes, while a cropped velvet bomber jacket can be rocked recreationally.


Vintage and thrift stores are great places to look for velvet blazers, or you can check out modern retailers

, Though your velvet blazer is undoubtedly a versatile piece, your go-to velvet jacket can’t go with just anything. Since it has such a conspicuous texture, you need to pair it with subtler textures which will offset the velvet rather than competing with it.Cotton, wool, and cashmere are good, neutral-texture options, while shiny silk, tweed, or lace should be avoided.

, In order to make your velvet blazer look chic but still casual, you should wear something casual or understated underneath. A neutral camisole or tank top are always solid options for work or play, while a funky band t-shirt can add an edge to the classy, velvet vibe.Stripes are also a great way to make a look more casual without being boring. A striped sweater, tee, blouse, or tank top beneath a velvet blazer adds an interesting, sporty twist to an otherwise formal look.

, A velvet blazer can go with practically anything, including formal trousers, dresses, skirts, and jeans. In order to make it casual, though, you’ll want to pair it with some jeans. Distressed and light colored jeans are in style, so feel free to experiment with these trendy looks. When in doubt, though, go for a solid, dark-rinse that looks appropriate in a variety of places and milieus.Boot-cut, skinny, and straight leg jeans will pair well with any blazer. Flared jeans are also making a comeback, but be aware that a dramatic flare under your velvet blazer might make your look overly vintage or costumey.

, Depending on your personal preference, you can top off your look with a variety of footwear. Flat combat boots or knee-highs will create a particularly laid-back feel to your ensemble, while wedges or heeled booties will add some height and polish to your look while still keeping it low-key.


Platforms are back in fashion and can play up to the vintage feel of your velvet blazer without seeming overly retro or antiquated.

"
"
Check out a velvet choker.,
Put on some velvet ankle booties.,
Add a small velvet accessory, such as a headband or cuff bracelet.,
Find a top or bottom with velvet accents.",How to Wear Velvet Casually3," You may have noticed that chokers are all the rage this season. They come in all different widths, colors, and materials, but one of the most popular is the classic velvet choker. These iconic ‘90s pieces look great out on the town at night, but they’re also doable in the daytime. Pair them with a flowy daytime dress or slouchy sweater to look easygoing but also on-trend and put-together.A narrower width will be more subtle than broader versions. You can even find chokers that mimic bolo ties or ribbons, creating a longer line that doesn’t read as such a bold choker-choice.

, Velvet ankle booties combine luxe sophistication with a retro rock n roll attitude. And, since they’re a relatively small part of your ensemble, they can be a good way to ease into the velvet trend. Pair them with some skinny jeans or boot-cut trousers to highlight the lush velvet while remaining casual and cool.You’ll find that most velvet booties have platforms or chunky heels, so you might want to look for a different velvet accessory if you’re uncomfortable with heels.

, Chokers might be the most popular velvet accessory, but they're not the only ones available. In fact, you can find a wide variety of hair accessories and jewelry in velvet, such as headbands, retro scrunchies, cuff bracelets, and baseball caps. Since these components are fairly small, you can incorporate them into almost any casual outfit without feeling like you're making a fashion statement.


Don't forget about handbags! Even though you might not wear them on your body in the same way that you wear a dress or a hat, they can constitute important and attention-grabbing elements of your ensemble. Velvet clutches and backpacks are particularly in vogue at the moment, as well as small, cross-body purses and pocketbooks.

, If you want to incorporate some velvet into your outfit without committing to a whole piece, look for jackets, belts, or bottoms with some velvet accents. A velvet trim on a dress or blouse, a velvet ribbon or stripe around the waist of a blazer, or velvet buttons on a jacket can all add flair to your ensemble while remaining subtle and casual.

Wear clothes that flatter your shape.,
Find your colors and play with it.,
Get personal.,
Be confident and don't fall for the latest trends.,
Fake it until you make it.,
Wash your clothes regularly.,
Get a new haircut.,
Relax.,
If someone starts to copy your style, don't change your style: upgrade it.",How to Work out Your Fashion Style," The first thing to do to look effortlessly stylish is to make sure that you’re wearing clothes that are good for your body type. Since effortless style is supposed to be subtle, you’ll need your clothes fitting well in order to get the elegant, expensive look from your clothing. You want clothes that make you look thinner and the perfect height, with everything in proportion.;
, Wear colors that suit your skin tone. Skin tone is broken down into “cool” and “warm.” While you do not need to limit yourself to a range of colors based solely on your skin tone, certain colors may make enhance your complexion better than others.


Cool toned skin has pink undertones, while warm toned skin has yellow or olive undertones. People with cool toned skin should look for colors on the blue side of the spectrum. Most blues look good on cool toned skin, as well as blue-tinted greens and violets. Light pinks also work well, as do vibrant oranges, which act as a complementary contrast. As far as neutrals go, look for blacks, grays, silvers, and stark whites.
People with warm toned skin should look for colors on the red side of the spectrum. Most reds and yellows look good on people with warm skin, as well as yellow-tinted greens and red-tinted violets. Browns, tans, golds, coppers, and off-whites tend to be the best neutrals.

, Think about who you are and how you want to be perceived by other. Your style needs to match your personality. Your clothes are like a description of you!


Go bold. Create an outfit that matches your style! Don't be afraid if you think your outfit is bad. It's your style! Everybody is different.

, Instead, mix it up a little. Choose garments because you love what they look like and the way they look on you.


Do you ever feel like some models could wear a brown paper sack and still walk down a runway looking like the height of fashion? Do you know a guy who wears a tracksuit and still somehow manages to look totally fashionable? What the fashion industry doesn’t want you to know is that a lot of looking stylish really comes down to projecting confidence.

, You don’t have to actually be confident, of course, but if you walk down the street in clothes that you clearly think you look great in, people will usually be inclined to agree that (at a minimum) those clothes are perfect for you.

, Clothes that are washed, dried, and wrinkle-free just look better than dirty clothes that have been piled in a corner in your room for the last week. No matter what clothes you choose, make sure that your clothes are in the best shape possible so that you look your best, as well.

, Trends come and go, so think carefully before you choose a style simply because it seems popular right now. Hair magazines can be especially helpful since they offer a variety of styles for a variety of lengths. Look at celebrities hairstyles. Find celebrities that have a similar face shape and hair type. If you have very curly hair, trying something suited for flat limp hair may work for a while, but you want to pick a hairstyle that is easy to take care of and that matched your natural hair. Bring a picture to your hair specialist.

, Again, effortless style is all about looking awesome while also looking like you didn’t try at all. Effortless, right? So relax. Take a generally chill attitude to everything in life. Always stay calm and happy, and you’ll look much better, no matter what you’re wearing.


Look comfortable, even when you’re not. Even if you’re wearing high stilettos, you need to look like it’s all perfectly natural and like if you were you’re perfectly comfortable. Don’t complain and constantly readjust your clothes. If that style isn’t working out for you, if you can’t seem casual in it, then try something that’s actually more comfortable. You can be comfortable and stylish.

, Take it as a compliment: that means you are becoming a trendsetter and people look up to you. Blush and don't bite! Keep your style updated with little tweaks and it will be hard to copy you.

Show it off.",How to Dress Like a K Pop Star," Watch videos and check out multiple pictures of your favorite stars online. Do you notice that they always wear their hair a certain way, or tend to choose one color over the other? This will help you get a feel of their overall style.


Keep in mind that the styles will change about every 3 months or so. K-pop idols like to keep fans on their toes, and you may opt for a few trends that have been fairly long-lasting.;
, After seeing what your favorite K-pop star wears, pick your favorite outfit of theirs or create one in your head. If this is an event where you want people to know who you are, you will probably be better off just wearing something that they've worn before. Remember that not all fashion will be easily accessible; remember, you are only trying to create a resemblance.


Most K-pop starts dress in metallic, glittery, or flashy outfits. Girls would wear shiny, blazers. Guys wear simple things such as corduroy jackets, jeans, or flashy tennis.

, Costumes can get pretty pricey. If you look on the internet, the basic but well made costumes can run up to $200! However, with a little extra work, you can get the clothes for a lot less. After having the outfit in mind that you want, go to a local thrift store. This may take a couple stores to go through before you find all that you need, but in the end, it will be worth it. You'll have the costume and have saved a ton of money.

, People tend to get these two confused. Japanese fashion is much funkier and hip, while Korean fashion is more classy and trendy.


Choose a style of clothing that has a certain outstanding visual pattern to it. Make it more western-like. It's okay to get creative with it, but just make sure you don't go too gaudy!

, Makeup is very important for both guys and girls.


Wear eye liner. Guys can use just a little it on the outer edge of their eyes, while girls can go for edgy looks with little eye shadow and lipstick. Sometimes the stars don't even wear any eye shadow, so that might be your choice too.
For guys, try not to overdo with the foundation, instead use a light BB cream in order to get a natural-looking complexion. An eyeliner always works magic by bringing out the eyes. A bronzer may also be applied to get a tanned look. Lip gloss will work wonders to get that kissable lips that will make female fans go gaga.
For girls, K-pop style is usually quite showy and exaggerated, hence you need to double your makeup to get that look. Be dramatic. Be generous with the eyeliner, false lashes, mascara, foundation and more.

, Do your make-up, put on your outfit and rock the night!

Wear a bold lip color.",How to Wear 80s Glam," One of the most recognizable fashion trends of the 1980s is, of course, big hair! Part dry hair into one- to two-inch sections.Back-comb the hair towards the root with a long-tail comb. Spray each section with a firm-hold hairspray as you go, and then apply a final all-over mist of spray once finished.Start with the lower layer of your hair and work upwards towards the top of your head in order to conceal the teasing.;
, If you have short hair in the front, top, or all over, decide if you want to spike or curl it to achieve a glam 80s look. Using a large-barrel curling iron, take a thin layer of bangs closest to your forehead, and curl it under. Then make one or more large, back- or side-facing curl(s) on top. To spike your hair, massage a dollop of pomade into your hair, and push your hair up and back with your fingers or a brush.


Seal either look with a heavy-hold hair spray and a blast of air from a hair dryer.

, Pull your hair up so that it sits in a bunch somewhere between the top and crown of your head. Alternately, you can gather all of your long hair to one side a few inches above your ear. Secure it with a hair elastic…or, better yet, a glam take on a scrunchie!Another option for an 80s updo is a big, messy topknot bun.
Use an all-over mist of firm-hold hair spray to keep the look in place.

, Do this to all of your hair, or just certain sections. Use a hair crimper with a zig-zag pattern to achieve crimped hair. To get tight 80s curls that mimic the then-popular perm, use a curling iron with a small barrel, such as 3/8 of an inch. For a similarly springy look, tightly braid into sections hair that is just slightly damp, and leave it in overnight. Alternately, you can put your hair in Jheri curls.Hair irons utilize varying heat settings, so follow the instructions that came with your hair iron to know how long to hold it to your hair. If you don’t have the instructions, look on your hair iron for the brand name and model of the product, then search online for its instruction manual.

, Wear a head band with a large, floppy bow. Or, add a fancy bandana in lieu of a headband. If you want your hair up, secure it with a banana clip!, Pick a clothing material that was popular in the 80s, such as leather, satin, or spandex. Look for bold patterns like animal prints, stripes, and brightly-colored floral or safari prints – especially in neon colors! Patterns that incorporate metallic or fluorescents like pink, green and purple were definitely happening in the 80s.


Patterns and clothing pieces with a heavy black-and-white contrast are totally 80s. For example, zebra prints and black-and-white stripes.
Other popular themes in 80s patterns include palm trees, paint splatters, cassette tapes or boomboxes, lightning bolts and squiggles.

, Wear a dress or jacket with big shoulders (think shoulder pads!). For pants, opt for a closely-tailored pair, or a slightly baggier, high-waisted version. If you like the “popped” collar look often seen in 80s fashion, look for a top with a large, stand-up collar. Keep an eye out for clothing pieces with details like large buttons or bows. You can find 80s clothing on eBay and Etsy, or try your luck at a local thrift shop.Suitcoats in the 80s were often in colors, instead of black or neutrals. Pair it with a satin or iridescent shirt and add a wide, patterned tie.
Dresses often had bulkier top portions, with fitted bottoms that fell midway between the thigh and the knee. For example, dresses with peplum tops and fitted skirts. Dresses commonly had ruffles and rouching on the shoulders., Take a sweater by the arms and tie it loosely around your neck. Arrange the body of the sweater so that it falls down your back. Or, opt for a stole or cape to drape over your shoulders.Wearing a sweater over your shoulders works well for a business casual look. You can wear this with a collared dress shirt (with or without a tie) or a polo shirt, and khaki pants. Loafers look great with this style, as do pants that end right at the ankles.
A cape or stole is a dressier look. Wrap a shawl around your shoulders, or drape a faux fur cape so that it hangs in the crooks of your arms. Wear it over a dress or an elegant jumpsuit.

, Penny loafers and suede shoes were popular for both males and females in the 80s. Other shoe options are jellies, or stiletto heels with pointed toes.Try wearing jellies with a skirt, dress or shorts. You can wear them barefoot, or with tights or knee-high stockings.
Penny loafers and suede shoes can be worn with any business casual outfit. Think long pants or knee socks.
Stiletto heels with pointed toes look best with dresses or skirts. Satin or patent leather heels are very 80s, as are versions with bows on them.

, Don full tights or wear footless leggings as tights. Look for tights in bright colors and bold prints. Optionally, you can add scrunched leg warmers from mid-calf to the top 1/3 of high-heeled shoes.For example, geometric patterns like checkerboards or Tetris designs were popular in 80s tights. Lace tights were seen, as were tights with animal prints.
Instead of patterned tights, you can choose tights in a solid, bright color. Your legwarmers don’t need to match your tights.

, Layer big, funky necklaces and bangles. Choose big hoop earrings, or earrings with large, dangling shapes such as stars. Look for colorful jewelry, or opt for a dressier look with rhinestones. Add a colorful watch, if desired.Wear big and colorful necklaces, earrings and bangles for a glam 80s look a step up from casual. Giant hoop earrings in bright colors go well with floppy hair bows, and outfits that layer lace or fishnet details into a top and skirt. Put on a Swatch Watch, and you’re good to go!
Rhinestones and velvet dresses went hand-in-hand in the 80s. Alternately, you can add rhinestone jewelry to formal satin pieces, or an iridescent taffeta gown.

, Haven’t you heard the 80s song “Sunglasses At Night?” When selecting 80s sunglasses frames, think oversized. Popular frame styles were horn-rimmed, aviators, and those that employed “shutter” lenses.Wayfarers and the Clubmaster, by the brand Ray-Ban, surged in popularity in the 80s.Look for any style of sunglasses where the temples have neon colors and/or wild patterns, differing from the rest of the frames.
Wear “shutter shades” in a bright, primary color or a fluorescent hue.

, Look for belts in black, white, metallic, rainbow, or neon. Elastic and leather materials are very 80s. Look for a belt with a large circular buckle, and wear the buckle towards the front (over your navel), or to the side. Your belt can be wide or skinny – you can even layer skinny belts to really channel the 80s vibe., Whereas these days people style their eyebrows with everything from wands and brushes to gels and pencils, the 80s celebrated untamed brows. If you want to fill in your brows, though, opt for a brow shadow or pencil that is darker than your hair color, like Madonna did in that decade., Choose 80s shadow colors such as pink, blue, purple, and/or orange. You can stack multiple colors on your upper lids. Freely apply it from your eyelids to your eyebrows.Don’t hesitate to use glittery shades…glitter was quite popular cosmetically in the 80s!

, Line your upper and lower lids with black pencil. Look for a creamy eye pencil for this look. Once applied, smudge it lightly with your fingers or an eyeshadow applicator. Add black mascara to your upper and lower eyelashes.Substitute navy or dark purple for the black eyeliner and mascara, if you prefer.
Another take on this look is to use dark eyeliner on your top lids, and a brightly-colored eyeliner on your bottom lids. For example, try lining your top lids with an inky black, and your bottom lids with a deep sky blue.
Line your lids normally right near the lash line. Optionally, you can extend the outside edges into cat eyes.

, Choose a foundation color a couple of shades lighter than your natural skin tone, if you want to be authentically 80s! This gives you a better canvas to accentuate the colors of the rest of your makeup. Don’t be afraid to pile on the foundation – just make sure to use a makeup sponge to blend it so that the contrast between your face and neck isn’t as striking., Choose an 80s blush color like bright pink or deep plum. Apply it to your cheekbones and about an inch above and below. Use circular motions to apply the blush with a round makeup brush.Many shades of pink blush were happening in the 80s, from pure pinks to purplish pinks as well as more coral hues. Whichever color you choose, apply it boldly to really capture the style of the decade.
80s fashion often saw blush extending from the cheekbones up into the hairline at the sides of the face. If you want your blush to make a statement – as 80s blush tended to do – go for it!

, Fill in around your lips with a lip pencil, then apply a glossy lipstick. Choose a bright lip color like hot pink or electric purple.If you want the 80s look with lipliner darker than the lips, use a lip pencil at least a couple of shades darker than your lipstick.If you’re really brave, don the 80s trend of a super-unconventional lip shade, such as grass green."

Wear a simple t-shirt or sweater.,
Go with classic plaid.",How to Wear a Jean Jacket," The “blue jean” look is classic, but it isn't the only color choice you have when you decide to pick out a jean jacket. Along with various blue jean washes, you can also select a denim jacket in a range of colors.Blue jean jackets are still the most common and the most versatile. Under most circumstances, blue jeans are considered a neutral, making a blue jean jacket a smart staple for your wardrobe.
Jean jackets are also available in a variety of other neutral colors. White jean jackets are probably the most popular option after the class blue jean. White jean jackets can add a clean, fresh air to your ensemble, especially for women.
If you feel a little bolder, you can also opt for a jean jacket in a bright color. Denim is available in many hues, ranging from tangerine orange to hot pink. For colored jean jackets, bright is the way to go. You should match these with like colors or with carefully chosen contrasting colors.
Note that colored jean jackets are more popular options for women rather than men.;
, If you do opt for the classic blue jean jacket, the next question you need to ask yourself is what wash to choose. The most versatile, classy wash is medium-dark.


Dark washes are easier to pull off than light washes in most settings. Dark wash jean jackets have a clean, well-taken-care-of appearance, and as a result, they are easier to pair with semi-nice clothes for a casual yet chic style.
Light washes tend to be harder for most people to pull off and can also look a little dated. You can opt for a light wash jean jacket if you plan on wearing it in strictly casual settings, though. You can also wear light wash denim jackets out on the town as long as you pair them with nice, well-fitting clothes.
Medium washes are for everyone in between. Medium wash jean jackets are for those who do not find either light or dark washes appealing.

,


A jacket without liner creates a slimmer figure. These jackets can be worn over clothes, but they can also be worn under an overcoat without looking too bulky.
Flannel liners add a little insulation for cooler nights, but the flannel will add a little bulk to your figure. These jackets also have a distinctly country-western look.
Shearling liners, also called lambskin liners, add considerable bulk but are also considerably warm. Jean jackets with shearling lining tend to look rugged.

, Most jean jackets tend to end just above the hip, but some can be cropped shorter than others.


Cut is mostly an issue concerning jean jackets for women. Jean jackets meant for men almost always extend down to the hip. As a man, you can wear a longer one, if desired, but too much length can make the jacket look oversized. Similarly, a jean jacket that is too short can make it look shrunken rather than stylish.
On the other hand, women can pull off a jean jacket that extends below the hip just as easily as they can pull off a jacket that is cropped just below the bust line. Longer jackets tend to have a classier feel, while cropped jackets create a more fashion-conscious appearance.
Women also need to be concerned with the shape. The standard, boxy jean jacket is always an option, but it rarely appears figure flattering. Consider a jean jacket with darts below the bust line. These darts hint at your curves just well enough to keep you looking feminine.

, Jean jackets can come with a variety of embellishments and other add-ons. The most classic, versatile jean jacket will be plain aside from a few pockets, though.


Distressed denim can be used for an 80s-fab or punk look. The same can be said for jean jackets that have rips or tears.
Metal studs can be worn on jackets for a rough-and-tough look.
Swirling paisley designs created with imitation rhinestones have a distinctly country-western flair.

, Some insist that denim-on-denim can never be done, but most people will agree that a denim jacket can look great with denim jeans as long as you mix and match colors and washes.


If you choose a white or colored jean jacket, your options are easy. Any pair of blue jeans will look fine.
If you choose a classic blue jean jacket, your options are a little harder to balance. Try choosing blue jeans that are a notably different shade of blue. If your jacket is fairly dark, go for lighter blue jeans, and vice versa. Alternatively, you can also wear your jean jacket with colored jeans or white jeans.
You can also wear your jean jacket over a chambray shirt as long as the two colors of denim are different., Instead of wearing your jean jacket over jeans, consider wearing it but pants or other bottoms made from other materials.


Corduroy pants and khaki cargo pants are a great option for jean jackets. The rugged look of these bottoms matches well with the semi-masculine appearance of denim, and the color choices available in corduroy and khaki also prevent your style from looking too monochromatic.
Leggings are another great choice for legwear. Wear contrasting leggings beneath a long tunic, dress, or skirt when you plan on shrugging your jean jacket on.
Shorts and skirts come in a variety of colors and patterns. As a result, many non-denim shorts and skirts are also great choices.

, By pairing your jean jacket with other classic wardrobe staples, you can create a no-fuss look that can be easily accessorized with jewelry, scarves, shoes, and bags.


For a classic casual look, wear a t-shirt and jeans with your jacket. The t-shirt can be a solid color, pattern, or a graphic tee, but it should be somewhat fitted to your body to avoid excess bulk.
Step it up a notch with a button-down shirt. Wear a collared button-down shirt in a solid color. Pair it with the darkest blue jeans you can find and throw on a medium wash or white jean jacket to create a look suitable for casual Friday., Pick one seasonable ""in"" item and wear it with other style staples.


Print and color trends are the easiest to work with. A jean jacket will work with nearly any print or color, regardless of whether the ""in"" look is tropical print, leopard print, neons, or pastels.
Be a little more discerning when pairing a denim jacket with style trends that change the shape of a garment. For instance, peplum tops, which flair out at the lower waist, may look better with cropped jackets that stop short of the flair instead of longer ones.

, The contrast between something undeniably girly and something somewhat boyish creates visual interest.


When choosing a dress or skirt, look for one that drapes well and has an airy aura to it. A knee-high skirt can work just as well as a maxi skirt.
Alternatively, you could also wear your jean jacket with a structured mini skirt. Mini skirts are usually feminine enough to hold their own against boyish denim, regardless of whether they are structured or flowing.
Wear girlish accessories with this look when possible. The balance between girly and boyish should still tilt more to the girly side, and accessories are a good way to accomplish that. Think along the lines of flirty shoes and jewelry.

, If your denim jacket is somewhat boxy, you can remedy the problem and accentuate your curves by wearing a belt or sash around your waist.


For this look, keep the jacket mostly buttoned.
Tie the belt or sash just below the bust. By wearing it there, you highlight the narrowest part of your torso. As a result, your feminine curves become more noticeable.

, A jean jacket can work with blue jeans, but you need to balance the washes carefully. You may also opt to wear the jean jacket with non-denim pants.


When wearing a jean jacket with blue jeans, make sure that the washes are different. A medium wash denim jacket can look great with a dark wash pair of jeans, but similar washes tend to bleed together, creating denim overkill.
If you like the feel of denim but not the look of jean-on-jean, you could opt for a pair of black jeans when you wear your blue jean jacket.
Consider wearing pants made from another material. Choose a rugged style, like corduroy pants or khaki cargo pants. These will work with jean jackets of nearly any style and wash.

, Moreover, wearing multiple layers on top can cut done on the monotony created when wearing a jean jacket with a pair of blue jeans.


Wear an unlined denim jacket to prevent the look from getting too bulky. Your other layers should be similarly thin.
Throw a structured, neutral jacket on over your jean jacket. Look for light materials, like a cotton-and-linen blend, and keep your look classy by choosing a muted color like tan or gray.
For an added degree of visual contrast, slip a sweater on beneath the jean jacket. A neutral color can look stylish, but if you want to introduce a small trace of color to your look, this bottom layer is a good, subtle way to do so. Make sure you stick with a lighter material, however, to prevent excess bulk.

,


Wear this look with a standard collared, button-down shirt and tie like you would usually wear beneath your blazer.
Opt for corduroy trousers over blue jeans to keep this look from getting a little too casual.
Keep your jean jacket partially buttoned, as you might do with a blazer. Allow the collar and tie to peek out, but keep the majority of the jacket closed.

, For a clean, casual look, pair your jean jacket with a clean sweater or t-shirt.


Your shirt should be in fairly good condition. Choosing a beat-up shirt can cause your look to veer off into grunge territory.
A cotton sweatshirt or sweater has a more classic, chic charm, but a cotton or cotton-blend t-shirt can look smart, casual, and comfortable.
Choose a shirt in a solid color for something a little more timeless. A patterned shirt or graphic tee can be used if you want to create something a little more low-key.

, Plaid and denim can be tricky to work with if you want to avoid looking too country-western, but these two classic style staples can work well together.


To create a more contemporary look, layer a button-down plaid shirt beneath a denim jacket. Leave the buttons open and wear a striped cotton t-shirt beneath the plaid. Layering is considered trendy by contemporary measures, so layering your plaid and denim in this manner can be very fashion-forward.
If country-western style is your thing, you could wear a flannel plaid shirt beneath your jean jacket and leave things at that. Wearing a lined jean jacket will make this look appear even more rugged.

Decide on the number of layers you want to year.,
Pick the right socks.,
Coordinate the colors.",How to Wear 80s Style Layered Socks1," In theory, you could wear as many layers of socks as you can fit into your shoes, but you should probably stick to two or three. This was more the norm, even for the 80’s, and will keep your feet from sweating too much.;
, In the 80’s, you could easily find slouch socks, which were specially designed to be layered. These long socks had very elastic tops and could be ""slouched,"" folded down, or bunched with ease. They were also made of thin material to prevent the wearer’s foot from getting too sweaty upon layering. If you cannot find actual slouch socks, look for colorful, thin socks that reach up to your mid-calf or higher.

, It was very important to properly coordinate the colors of your layered socks in the 80’s. The colors should match the colors found in your outfit, and each layer must use a different color. For example, if your shirt has white, orange, and red in it, your sock layers should also be white, orange, and red.

Pull on the first pair of socks, stretching the socks out as far up your leg as they will go.,
Pull the second pair of socks over the first.,
Pull on the third pair over the first two.,
Push the top (third) layer down toward your ankle.,
Push or fold the second layer down.,
Push the bottom layer down.,
Choose other 80’s style pieces to match the look of your socks.",How to Wear 80s Style Layered Socks2," The layer needs to be smooth and they shouldn’t bunch.

, This pair should also extend as far up your leg as possible, and must also be smooth and free of bunching.

, Again, pull the socks up as high as they will go.

, You may also fold the top layer down. Either way, one or two inches of bunched up sock material should be visible above your ankle.

, One or two inches of bunched material should be visible above the top layer of sock. Do not let this middle layer overlap or cover the top layer. Both layers should be visible and distinct.

, One or two inches of material should be visible above the middle layer of sock, and all three layers should be noticeable and distinct.

,


Don a bright, oversized top with colors that coordinate with your socks.
Wear a pair of capri leggings that stops short of your socks, or pull your layered socks over a full-length pair of leggings so they still show.
Complete the ensemble with hi-top sneakers and excessive amounts of colorful jewelry.

Start with something loose and flowy.,
Follow existing seams.,
Adjust the sleeves.,
Tailor other aspects on vintage tops.",How to Tailor Vintage Clothing1," Vintage tops are great for tailoring because so many of them have billowy shapes that are easy to take in and alter – especially items from the 1960s and 70s.This is an especially good tip if you are just starting out with tailoring your own clothes. If you choose a baggier item, you can always pin it and then start over by letting it out again if you need to.;
, When tailoring vintage tops, you’ll need to take things apart at existing seams with a seam ripping tool and then use your sewing machine to resew it along those same seam lines. Otherwise your work (and your clothes) will look sloppy and unprofessional.Be careful to keep track of how the pieces originally go together when you are taking apart the seams.

, Vintage clothing, especially women’s clothing, often has outdated looking sleeves, which you can consider tailoring to make it look a bit more modern and wearable. To do so, you’ll need to measure the existing sleeves and compare that to your desired length. Rip out the existing seams and pin the sleeves along the new measurement lines.Once you have finished measuring and pinning, you are ready to sew the seam closed again.

, In addition to the sleeves, you can alter just about any other aspect of a vintage top to adjust it to your personal fit and style. You can adjust the collar to create a more personalized neckline. You can measure and pin a baggy blouse so that you can resew it into a slimmer silhouette.


Remember to follow along the existing seams whenever possible to avoid making the vintage piece look amateurishly redone.

Find a blouse or suit jacket with thick shoulder pads.,
Try an oversized top.,
Wear a mini-skirt.,
Throw on leggings or decorative stockings.,
Look for stirrup pants.,
Consider acid-wash jeans.,
Remember to wear your leg warmers.,
Wear “jellies.” Jellies, also called “jelly shoes,” were a type of brightly colored footwear made from PVC plastic.,
Wear the right heels.,
Wear sneakers or boots.,
Throw on your largest pair of earrings.,
Tease your hair.,
Use make-up to accentuate your cheeks and eyes.",How to Dress in the American 1980s Fashion1," Big shoulders became a hot fashion as more women found themselves entering the workplace. A square-cut suit jacket with heavy shoulder pads looks 1980s-professional, while a blouse or dress with thick shoulder pads works well for more casual looks.;
, If shoulder pads aren't your thing, consider an oversized sweater, sweatshirt, or blouse. Look for one with a broad scoop neckline. Solid colors work best, but you may also consider a top with a gaudy geometric pattern.

, Denim mini-skirts work especially well, but leather and knit materials may also look fine. If selecting a colored skirt, go with a hot pink or other bright, neon color.

, These work especially well beneath mini-skirts and oversized sweaters that come down to the mid-thigh or lower. Look for solid colors or patterned tights with spots, stripes, textured lace, or other embroidered designs.

, These pants are made of a stretch knit fabric that tapers down toward the ankle. At the ankle, the pants have an elastic ""stirrup"" strap that fits under the heel. Choose a pair in any color or pattern, from black to neon orange.

, Look for an old pair with bleach marks or holes. Cut-offs with ragged edges also look appropriate for a classic 1980’s look.

, This trend was especially popular in the early to mid decade. In the 1980s, leg warmers could be found in wool, cotton, and synthetic fiber blends. They came in a variety of colors, with brighter colors favored over duller, neutral hues. Wear leg warmers with nearly any bottom, whether you choose a mini-skirt or skinny jeans.

, The shoes have a semi-transparent, glossy sheen, and were often infused with glitter. Most jellies were flats, but some had low heels.

, Adult women wore heels with the majority of their outfits, whether professional or casual. Select a pair of pointed toe sling-backs with a high, slender heel. Go with white or black for a versatile option, or consider a bright yellow or pink if you want to play on the loud, neon-colored reputation of American 1980s fashion.

, In addition to heels and jellies, teenagers and young women also wore sneakers and boots with many of their outfits. Consider a pair of thick-soled, black lace-up boots. Wear the boots with nearly any bottom, from mini-skirts to acid wash-jeans.

, In general, popular jewelry during this decade was gaudy and large. Earrings were especially in vogue, however. Look for diamante or pearl earrings, preferably in gold. Dangle earrings that brush your shoulder or collar work best.

, No American 1980s look would be complete without big, teased locks.


Take a section of your hair by the crown of your head.
Comb downward toward the scalp in short strokes.
Spray hairspray near the roots of the section you just teased.
Repeat the initial teasing process with a section of hair beneath the first section to give your hair a bump.
Repeat the entire teasing process with the rest of your hair.

, Do not be afraid of over-applying. Cosmetics in the 1980’s were notoriously noticeable.


Trace around your entire eye with black eye liner.
Apply mascara.
Wear bright eye shadow. Choose a bold color and consider wearing contrasting shades at the same time.
Apply heavy blush to your cheekbones.

Find or buy a pair of skinny jeans.,
Go for a simple top.,
Invest in a nice jacket.,
Stick to flats.,
Be natural with your makeup.,
Keep your hair simple and loose.,
Always have a pair of sunglasses.",How to Look Like Eleanor Calder," You can go for any color, however, Eleanor tends to wear black, indigo, and acid wash skinny jeans the most. If you don’t have a pair at home, you can find them in any store like H&M, Forever21, or TopShop. To get a look similar to Eleanor’s usual skinny jeans, try a high-waisted pair from ASOS, like the Farleigh Mom Jeans for around $30.


You can also change out your skinny jeans for a pair of high-waisted shorts or a skirt, like the MOTO denim button front a-line skirt from TopShop for $15.;
, Eleanor’s look is very neutral and classic. She also maximizes comfort, which is why you will often find her in t-shirts like the Stilton short sleeved black t-shirt or a Rag & Bone tee. However, since these items are upwards of $50-$100, try looking for black, gray, or white v-neck/crew neck t-shirt on sites like TopShop and H&M.


You can also try a striped or polka dot blouse, like the BDG Polly Flannel shirt from Urban Outfitters.

, Eleanor wears a lot of different coats, though she is probably most famous for some of her leather ones or her bomber jacket. Try looking for a black leather jacket similar to the Burberry Biker jacket or a fur-lined one from Acne Studios. For a cheaper duplicate, try Urban Outfitters., Whether she’s in sneakers, boots, or pumps, Eleanor tends to avoid heels. Depending on the time of day and the season, you can change it up. For example, try wearing a pair of all white sneakers like the Women’s Freestyle Hi Lace-Up sneaker from Reebok for an everyday look. Then, in the colder months, try a pair of black, suede, over-the-knee boots similar to her Stuart Weitzman pair. You can also try out a sandal like her Shanna Gladiator ones in the summer., The most makeup Eleanor ever wears is a bit of foundation, mascara, eyeliner, neutral blush, and lip gloss. To mimic her look, try a natural shade like beige, tan, or matte gold on your eyelids. Once applied, blend it into a darker shade in your crease and line your lashes with a thin black eyeliner. Then, just apply your mascara and a tinted gloss and you’re good to go!


Try a light pink or dusky rose for your lips. You want a little color, but nothing over-the-top.

, Eleanor's hair is usually seen in waves and parted in the middle. You can recreate this look with a curling wand like the Babyliss curling wand, which is what Eleanor herself uses. However, you can also create waves using a straightener by twisting it first. If you can’t get your hair to wave properly, try putting it into a messy bun or braid., Eleanor is almost never seen without her Ray-Bans. However, while she’s partial to the 3025 Aviator pair, you can also find her in different styles like a pair of pink Dior shades. The most important thing is to find a shape and shade that suit your face.For example, if you have a round face, try square frames. Whereas if you have a square face you should aim for round sunglasses. If your face is more heart-shaped, aviator glasses are the way to go. And for those of you with oval faces, you are free to wear whatever shape you'd like."

Try a shirt dress.,
Realize that further into the decade, styles changed.,
Get the right type of pants/trousers.,
Wear a hat!,
Know the hairstyles for women.,
Invest in some period appropriate shoes and gloves.,
Carry a handbag.",How to Dress in the American 1950s Fashion1," Quarter length sleeves were popular during this time period. The shoulders were fitted rather than puffy. However, sleeveless blouses were also popular. Small collars close to the neckline, called Peter Pan collars, were typically round in shape.;
, This type of clothing was hemmed at the hip level to emphasize a woman's small waist. Collars on jackets were often small and rounded in the Peter Pan style, just like on the blouses. There were many types of decorative pockets and big buttons on jackets in the 1950s., There were several different types of skirts that were popular in the 1950s. Here are some of the most common styles:


Full skirts. These had more fabric, often with layered petticoats to make it more full. The material could be sewn in many different ways including circle, gathered, pleated or gored.
Pencil skirts. These skirts were narrow and straight.The skirts were designed to emphasize the woman's slim waistline, which was a very important factor in the 1950s
Swing skirts. These were knee high skirts that were also called poodle skirts. However, poodles were not the only animal featured on swing skirts. Nearly any animal, insect, or flower could be depicted on this kind of skirt.

, Shirt dresses were very popular. These had a shirt-like bodice, with no gathered/exaggerated waistline. A narrow belt was often worn with this kind of dress.

, Here is a run down of silhouette styles after 1955:


The A-line look (narrow shoulder to wide hem) was very popular.
Looser fitting dresses were also seen mid-decade.
Sac (or Sack) dresses became common; these were loose and baggy.
At this time, the hemline for most skirts and dresses was near the knee.
Jackets became boxy and the Chanel look (a type of woman's suit) was worn. This look had contrast trim around the jacket edges, no collar, and small pockets with contrast buttons.

, There were several different styles of pants popular for women in the 1950s. Pant legs became narrow during the '50s. Pants were very popular and worn at home and for leisure.


The capri was mid-calf length; the peddle pusher was a long short; Bermuda shorts were knee-length. These were worn with flat shoes, ballet-type flats, and simple sneakers (like Keds). Socks were optional.

, Small hats worn close to the head were popular during the early 1950s, but during the latter years flower pot hats were seen. These kinds of hats were worn higher on the head and were bigger in shape.

, Early in the '50s hairstyles were short and close, much like Audrey Hepburn's style, with short bangs in the front and short, flat layers on the sides and back.


Later, women's hairstyles became larger and bouffant, in the fashion of Elizabeth Taylor.This style was often worn shoulder-length with buoyant roll curls in the front that continue into the sides of the hair in the wavy pageboy style.

, Gloves of all colors were worn with dresses. Longer (above the elbow) gloves were worn at night with bracelets for a more formal look, while shorter (wrist length) gloves were worn in the daytime.Shoes often had pointed toes and thin kitten heels.

, In the 1950s, handbags grew smaller, often envelope in shape. The ""Kelley"" bag was a simple hand bag with handle. Wicker and gold lame were popular handbag material.Most handbags had shorter handles (no long straps).

Hem the legs to the desired length.,
Alter the waist.,
Tailor the fit.,
Slim down a wider leg.",How to Tailor Vintage Clothing2," If you want perfectly tailored vintage pants, the first thing you’ll need to do is to make sure they match your leg length exactly. Measure the inseam (from the crotch to the bottom hem) of some pants that you know fit perfectly, then use that measurement to find the correct length for your vintage pants.Use a straight-stitch on your sewing machine to sew the hemline. Try to match the thread to the color of the fabric as closely as possible, unless you want to create a bold outline statement with an off-set colored stitch.

, To get vintage pants fitting properly, you’ll need to adjust the waistline to fit your body type. You can either measure your own waist with a tape measure, or you can measure the waist of some pants you already have that fit well.Remember that you’ll need to add 2 in (5.1 cm) to the measurement of your own waist if you use a tape measure on yourself. The measurement plus 2 in (5.1 cm) is the size you should make the waist of your vintage pants.
You will need to let the waist in or out, depending on the size of the pants compared to your own size.

, Depending on when the vintage clothing was made, you will probably need to adjust the way they fit in order to make them work with your more modern wardrobe. Try to cut and sew along existing seams to maintain as much of the original design as possible.You should keep trying on the clothing as you work on it to make sure the fit is still what you want.

, Many vintage style pants will be a baggier or more wide-legged style, so you may have to tailor the legs for a tighter fit. To do so, you’ll need to use your seam rippers to open the seams up. Then measure the material to the desired length and pin it. After the pining, you should try the pants back on to ensure you have the right fit. Then sew the seam back up to finish the look.

Scour the racks at thrift shops.,
Try garage sales.,
Browse online resale shops.",How to Tailor Vintage Clothing3," One of the best ways to find vintage clothing to alter yourself is by browsing through multiple thrift shops. Spend some time going through the racks to see what you can find. Try going to several thrift stores.Remember that thrift stores are constantly receiving new items, so it’s often worthwhile to check back frequently.

, Lots of people purge their closets by having garage or yard sales. They often just want to get rid of stuff and not deal with the hassle of reselling items, even if they might be quite valuable. Look in your local paper for yard sale listings and go around searching for cool vintage finds.The early bird usually gets the worm when it comes to garage sales, so try to go earlier in the morning if you want to score the best items.

, Many people sell their used clothing online – including pictures and negotiable prices. You can usually contact the owner with any additional questions you might have. This is a great way to save time and money when shopping for vintage clothing.


Try looking on websites like eBay where individuals sell their own used clothing, rather than shopping through marked-up items from retro retail stores."

Add volume to your hair.",How to Dress in the American 1980s Fashion2," Think bold geometric designs for sweaters or Hawaiian print for shirts. Look for a thick sweater with a bulky, boxy cut.

, Authentic jackets had a black tag over the breast pocket that read ""Members Only,"" but if you cannot find an authentic jacket, simply mimic the style. Look for a cotton-polyester jacket with a nylon lining, elastic waistband, elastic wrists, a zipper front, and snaps at the neck. Choose a coat in any color.

, Light acid wash jeans work best. Find a style that fits snug around your legs, since men in tight jeans were more fashionable during this decade than those in baggy jeans.

, In the early 1980s, these pants were tighter, but by the end of the decade, they were exceptionally baggy. Look for a pair of pants made from shiny synthetic material. If possible, find one with multiple zippers, since these were considered more stylish.

, If you want a more professional look, go for a conservative cut suit jacket in a pastel blue or other light color. Pair the jacket with white pants. This look is also known as the ""Miami Vice"" look.

, Loafers work best when paired with pastel suit jackets and other conservative styles.

, If you decide to go with acid wash jeans or parachute pants, find a heavy pair of sneakers or boots. Consider thick-soled black boots that lace up.

, Look in your local newspaper coupons, yellow pages and online listings for a local tailor who can adjust your suit coats, pants and shirts to fit you perfectly. If you want to save money, look for an independent tailor, rather than one in a shop, since they are likely to give you a deal for tailoring a lot of clothes.

, If you don’t own a pair of oxfords, wingtips, derby shoes or loafers, buy a pair. Choose leather, weatherproof them and shine them regularly, and they should last you for years.For a sportier look, try military inspired Chukka boots.
Popular brands include Clark’s, Steve Madden and Sperry Top Sider.
Look for a deal on eBay, Amazon or Overstock.

, You can look dapper in jeans, but start with selvedge slim fit jeans in a dark wash. Get them tailored if they come close to touching the ground.

, Look for sales on slim fit suits and Brook’s Brothers, Macy's or even Men’s Warehouse. Some department stores even include tailoring for no extra cost, although you usually have to pay for the service.

, Dapper style is versatile; so that you can wear a vintage blazer with jeans, suit pants, slacks and a shirt. Shop at J Crew or look through vintage and thrift stores to find slim fit blazers or those you can tailor cheaply.

, Trade in your t-shirts for colored, white, plaid, patterned and striped shirts. Look for sales at The Gap, J Crew, Urban Outfitters and department stores, and pick them up whenever you can.


Make sure the shirt sleeves are long enough. When you wear a shirt and a suit coat, approximately one-fourth inch (0.6cm) of your shirt cuff should be showing through the bottom of the coat.

When buying a belt, you need one that is two sizes above your waist size. If you have a size 30 waist, you need a size 32 belt. Military belts are adjustable.

, Fold it in half twice and then place it in your pocket with one-fourth inch showing. Match the pocket square to a color in your shirt or your tie.

, Bright and men’s patterned socks show a little style and color. However, they only peak out occasionally. They show full commitment to a dapper style.

, Buy one shirt that requires cufflinks, to wear at parties, weddings and other events. Purchase metal cufflinks.

, Although you may use your cell phone to check the time, a round-faced watch with hands is essential for a dapper outfit. Choose an explorer watch or any nice watch with a leather or metal band.

, You don’t need to wear one every day, but a well-worn four-in hand or Windsor tie is a good touch. Break out the bow tie on special occasions and garden parties.

Wear a fitted suit.,
Ditch the hat.,
Pay attention to the trends for shirts.,
Know what pants were in fashion.,
Find the right shoes.,
Know the hairstyles for men.",How to Dress in the American 1950s Fashion2," During this time, suits were becoming more narrow - with slim ""cigarette leg"" pants and a sack coat shape (like a Brooks Brother's suit). Charcoal grey was a popular color for men's suits.Note: a white shirt was usually worn with this grey suit, along with a plain, narrow tie.

, Before the war, all men wore hats. But moving into the '50s, hats became less and less popular. Why? Because men were driving more and hats were bothersome to wear while in the car.

, For men, there were many situational fashions that were worn at certain times by certain types of people.


Khaki and plaid shirts or button-down collared oxford cloth shirts were seen on students. T-shirts were seldom worn alone because they were considered an undershirt. Hawaiian shirts and box shirts were worn in the summer.

, Slim-legged cigarette pants were a popular men's style during this time period. Jeans were typically used for outdoor wear, but many teenagers wore them more regularly. Bermuda shorts were often worn in the summer.

, In the 1950s, most men wore Oxford shoes (often two-toned), saddle shoes, or chukka boots. Saddle shoes are two toned (usually black and white) leather shoes with a flat heel. They are typically a white shoe with a black decorative ""saddle"" in the middle section. Chukka boots are ankle-high leather boots that typically only have 2-3 pairs of holes for lacing the shoelace.

, Hair was worn short, in a post-military style. Men started to wear their hair longer at the end of the decade, but it was still groomed to stay off the ears.Some men also went for the longer, greased pompadour. Elvis Presley made this hairstyle famous in the 1950s.

Find clothes with shoulder pads.,
Look for over-sized tops.,
Try stirrup pants.,
Wear mini skirts.,
Rock some jelly shoes.",How to Dress 80s Style1," In the 1980s, it was almost impossible to find a jacket, blouse or dress without shoulder pads -- and even if you could, you would probably put them in yourself, perhaps layering one set on top of the other! Shoulder pads give you a boxy, square-shouldered silhouette, which is perfect for making a statement in business attire or evening wear., Over-sized tops were everywhere in the 80s. Try a massive, off-the-shoulder sweatshirt, a giant t-shirt worn over leggings, or a brightly-colored sweater cinched in at the waist with a gaudy belt. Over-sized tops are also really easy to get.—Just buy a top that's several sizes too big, or shop in the men's section!, Stirrup pants were one of the more unfortunate 80s trends. Usually made from a stretchy fabric, these pants had an elastic ""stirrup"" that hooked around the underside of the foot, pulling the pants down and creating an unflattering, triangle-shaped leg. However, if you really want to commit to 80s fashion, these are the way to go!

, The mini skirt came to the forefront of fashion in the 80s and has never really left. Look for skintight skirts in materials like denim, PVC and cotton and pair them with an over-sized, off the shoulder t-shirt (tucked into the skirt) and some legwarmers for true 80s fashion cred.

, Jelly shoes were an 80s staple. Made from PVC and available in a wide variety of styles and colors (some were even glitter-infused), jelly shoes are the perfect accompaniment to any 80s outfit. This cheap and cheerful footwear has been making a comeback in recent years, so you you shouldn't have any trouble finding them."

Be authentic Victorian.",How to Incorporate Late Victorian Style in Your Fashion (for Ladies)," Ideally, you'll want to look for:


High-collard shirts or turtlenecks.
Anything made of lace is appropriate. For example, sleeves, shirts, skirts, etc.
Long A-line skirts (fitted at the natural waist and flares out at the bottom), knee to floor-length.
Peasant blouses, vests, or corseted tops.
Fitted clothing, but not revealing.;
, To be representative of the Victorian style, consider choosing dark, heavily saturated fabric for an older look. For a younger look, choose white or soft pastels.

, They were just as important to Victorian ladies as they are to many ladies in current eras. The only difference was the style of shoes and the fact that what you can wear now is much more comfortable. So, stick with the comfort but look for what could pass as Victorian footwear. Look for:


Oxford style and Gibson style shoes.
Any similar boots with buttons or snaps down the sides, and closed toe.
Boots that range in length from caff to ankle.
Earth-toned colors or dyed leather.
Slippers for at home: Victorian women wore slippers around the house and these were typically fabric slide-ons with no back.
It is possible to still find authentic Victorian style boots online or in some shoe shops. However, be aware that feet sizes have grown considerably over the decades and you may find them both uncomfortable and of a poor fit. Perhaps for the display cabinet rather than on your feet.

, Undergarments were very important in constructing the classic shape of the mid-late Victorian outfit. However, the exact style of underwear worn by Victorian women can be quite cumbersome for this day and age, so most of the time, stick to nice lace underwear that helps you to feel in sympathy with the olden day style. Still, sometimes the real style of undergarments may be nice or authentic to wear, so you could try them just for fun:


Bustles: These were small pads or bamboo wood cages worn underneath the dress to make it poof outward in the back. These can be easily made by creating or purchasing a small pillow and folding it over. Then securing it just above the natural waist with a belt or by attaching a thick ribbon to it and tying it in place.
Bloomers: These were a form of underwear that looked like shorts with ruffles.Try swapping out modern-day underwear for bloomers to get an extra Victorian feel with your outfit.
Petticoats: These are underskirts designed to give a dress more volume and help keep their shape. These were usually made with fluffed up or ruffled fabric to take up space. This way the skirt or dress will not lay flat against your legs. You can purchase these currently in dress shops, online, or make one with tulle or crinoline fabric.

, Corsets were a key part of a Victorian woman's wardrobe. Contrary to popular belief, corsets will not crush your ribs, squeeze your organs, or make it hard to breathe. In fact, they are known to improve posture and confidence. Bras weren't invented in the Victorian era, so most ladies used corsets as a type of bra. Even today there are women who wear corsets quite happily day in and day out, the difference being that it's now a choice. There are two types of corsets:


True corsets: These have steel support strips inside called boning (antique versions will have whalebone supports). If you want to achieve an accurate, realistic Victorian hourglass shape, purchasing an authentic corset and learning about waist training will form part of your experience. However, these corsets are very pricey as they're a lot of work to make and you will need to be committed to training yourself in the proper wearing of them. It might be a good idea to trial one if someone you know can lend you one and help you with it initially.
Fashion corsets: These are worn on the outside of clothing and are not meant to lace tightly like true corsets do. They can have beautiful patterns or designs. If you want the idea and feel of a corset, but not the commitment, try searching and purchasing a fashion corset for much less money.
Overbust corsets go over your bosom, while underbust only stop under the breast-line. These styles can be either fashion or a true corset.

, Most Victorian women carried small things with them day-to-day. Some typical examples include:


Fold-up fans and small drawstring purses: These are held, or attached to the bustle with a string and hung at the side.
Parasols: These are like small umbrellas. They were used to keep the sun from tanning the skin of a proper Victorian lady, and are still very useful for the same purpose.
White gloves: These were usually worn when going out or visiting someone. Lace wrist cuffs, gauntlets, and fingerless gloves can be a more efficient way to get this look.
Spats: These are white fabric that wraps around boots and snap on securely. These were used to keep mud and dirt from getting onto new boots. Hard to find in stores, but quite easy to make using online patterns, or may be purchased online, perhaps from boutique seamstresses.
Handkerchiefs: These were widely popular items for women to carry. They come in a range of pretty and delicate styles. Look under the collectible linens sections of auction sites for older, lacy versions that are more likely to be complementary to the Victorian style.

, Victorian ladies were very proud of their hair. It was their glory and rarely or never did they cut or shave it. However, they did trim ends and bangs. Some common Victorian hairstyles were:


Braided styles. French braids and large side-braids were most common. Many times the bangs were cut and curled and the rest of the hair was braided. Then the end of the braid was curled as well.
Up-dos. Buns were very common among Victorian ladies, especially those who worked. Their hair stayed out of the way and was protected against any hazards.
Curls. Corkscrew, or ""Shirley Temple Curls"" were popular in the Victorian age, long before Shirley Temple was even born. Many Victorian ladies had loose, curled sections of hair. However, the hair never went past shoulder-length.
Dark hair was considered more desirable in this age.Many women dyed their hair with lead-based dyes to achieve a raven black, or brown color. Since hair dye is much safer now, you may choose to dye your hair, or purchase a wig. Or, just leave your hair as it is.
Hats and hairpins. These accessories were used by Victorian women as well. Delicate and intricate hairpins with emerald or rubies, hats with plumes or lace, and mesh webbing were popular.

, Many Victorian ladies wore make-up, but they didn't want anyone to know they were wearing anything at all. It was fashionable to many at the time to be as pale as possible. If you want to achieve a Victorian style make-up look, try:


Using moisturizers and sunscreen to make the skin as smooth as possible. Smooth, porcelain-like skin was seen as most attractive.
Evening out skin tone, sunspots, and blemishes with concealer or powder.
Using natural lip colors such as reds, pinks and browns, or beeswax lip gloss.
Very light blush on the apples of your cheeks.
Remember, you want to look as natural as possible.

, Every proper Victorian lady had some kind of jewelry to wear. Whether it was just one brooch, a single hatpin, or her wedding ring. Victorian era jewelry is easy to find, so you can even wear the real deal. Check antique and thrift stores and online auctions for Victorian jewelry. Be on the look out for:


Cameos. These were profile silhouettes of women from the shoulders up. Typically they didn't have much detail and were carved out of ivory or coral. They are now made of plastic or clay, but look authentic.
Jewel designs like little flowers or bows. These were common for brooches.
Gems such as emeralds, rubies, diamonds, pearls, sapphires were commonly used for necklaces and earrings. Silver and gold were frequently used as well.

, This refers to any modern-day style with a distinct Victorian inspired looks. Some of these styles include:


Steampunk. This is Victorian-based sci-fi. Steampunk style takes all of the Victorian ""morals"" such as women not being able to wear pants, show their ankles, or too much skin, and rebels against it all. It's a mix of modern-day thinking in Victorian fashion. It is common for steampunk to use the colors brown, gold, silver, black, white, and cream, with splashes of color here and there. Mechanical limbs, gears, cogs, and goggles are also frequently used by those who dress steampunk.
Victorian goth and Steamgoth. Victorian goth is basically Victorian era clothing, but mostly just black with splashes of color. Steamgoth is steampunk with mostly black instead of brown.
Victorian Lolita (or Gothic Lolita) is a Japanese street fashion which has Victorian blouses and corsets, along with fluffy knee-length dresses, candy, anime, or sweet inspired prints on fabric, and a lot of ruffles and lace. If you are more of a ""girly-girl"", this may be the style for you.

, For the truly dedicated, only. If you really want to have an authentic Victorian wardrobe, certain things could be cut out from your closet. Such as:


Anything with neon or extremely bright colors
Pants, jeans, leggings, and shorts
Miniskirts, or dresses with a short hemline
Modern heels and gym shoes
Sleeveless shirts
Sweaters; shirts that reveal skin beyond the arms, shoulders, and neck; and t-shirts
Modern underwear (using bloomers, corsets, chemises, and stays instead)


This is true dedication, so be sure it's what you really want before throwing out any of your easy-living clothing.

Be adaptive.,
Play up the wartime silhouette.,
Wear war-appropriate shoes.,
Pay more attention to hair.,
Feminize an austere look with makeup.,
Add accessories.",How to Dress in American 1940s Fashion1," Here are a few trends that were directly affected by materials rationing.


Remake what's old. Both men and women reused and retailored outfits left over from the 1930s. To accommodate current trends, women would shorten the classic drop-waist of the '30s silhouette to rest at the more fashionable natural waist. Hemlines were even higher than before! Additionally, as more American men were drafted, women at home remade their left-behind clothing into slim-fitting pants, blouses and jackets to be more usual for the more active lives they had to lead.
Utility. Less fabric became the way to go. Less buttons, pleats and zippers were used. Women's hemlines were lifted to save on fabric, and their garments kept to a slim cut with little embellishment. For the first time women began wearing pants in masses to increase work safety.Musicians and mobsters wore wide, elaborate zoot suits, but most American men could buy ""victory suits"" that offered no rolled cuffs on the trousers, no sleeve buttons, and no patch pockets, in addition to shorter jackets and narrower trousers. Waistcoats or vests were abandoned in favor of double-breasted suits jackets.
Wear plain colors. Brown and green dyes were heavily rationed for use in military uniforms. In response, deep maroon, gray, or undyed white or beige fabrics were available for popular use. Bright neon colors were not seen in clothing because chemical dyes were not used.
Give up unnecessary undergarments. Girdles were made scarce by rubber rationing during the war. In response, most women's skirts and pants featured elastic waistbands that required no fasteners and could fit a variety of sizes. Undershirts had fallen out of popular fashion for men during the strain of the Great Depression, and after Clark Gable was pictured without one in the 1934 movie It Happened One Night.

Get creative. Perhaps the most iconic item to be rationed during the war was women's stockings. After both silk and nylon became scarce, women would paint their legs a slightly darker tone and use black liquid eyeliner to draw the usual seam up the back of the leg to give the appearance, from far away, of wearing stockings.;
, As women's skirts and dresses became shorter to save on fabric, legs emerged as the most prominent and desirable feature of the early-1940s figure. Additionally, as men and women's clothing adhered to slim cuts throughout the body, shoulder pads became popular for both sexes as a way to add interest to the silhouette.

, Because rubber was in short supply, wooden pumps and wedge heels gained popularity with American women. To save on shoe leather, peep toes and T-straps became fashionable. Flat, utilitarian shoes were also a practical everyday choice for women working in factories.

, Though men's haircuts retained much of the slick look they'd had during the 1930s - or turned to buzz cuts, for enlisted soldiers - women used hairstyles as a way to remain fashionable in spite of textile rationing. Trims were expensive and short hair was hard to tie back at work, long locks were in style.


The hat market in the 1940s was dominated by Europeans , American women began to favor smaller hats or no hats at all. Complicated styles -such as victory rolls, pin curls or finger waves - were popular, as were ribbons, headbands and other embellishments.

, Bold makeup was another avenue by which American women sought to add a feminine angle to plain clothing. Eye makeup was kept fairly tame, with mascara and eyeliner on the top lid. Eyebrows were arched more naturally, but still had an arc that could only be achieved with tweezing and shaping. It was still common to fill in lipstick beyond the lip line, especially to emphasize the curve of the “Cupid's bow” of the top lip to more of a gentle arc. Bright, matte lip colors, such as coral pink or fire-engine red, ruled the day. Tangee lipstick, the original color-change lipstick, is still available. Nail color generally matched a woman's lipstick color.

, Gloves were less essential to complete a woman's look than they had been in the 1930s (and less than they would be again in the '50s), but remained a popular staple. Handbags and pocketbooks were fashionable, as well. For men, a fedora tipped at a jaunty angle was the hat of choice.

Enter an ulzzang photo contest.","How to Be the Asian Style ""Ulzzang"""," You don't have to have naturally large eyes to give the illusion of ulzzang beauty. Circle lenses give off the illusion of large eyes, even if you have smaller, more normal-sized eyes.


See an ophthalmologist and ask your parents before wearing cosmetic lenses. They're not right for all eye-types, especially if you have astigmatism or other shape-issues with your eyes. You can also learn to give the impression of larger eyes using make-up.;
, Paired with contact lenses, a highlighting note of eyeliner will make your eyes really ""pop.""

, You may also apply false eyelashes if you want to, but make sure your eyelashes aren't thick. Ulzzang is notable for its use of natural-looking skin tones in the make-up, so you don't want the lashes to look heavy or clumpy.

, It's best to sweep a white/beige eyeshadow across the lids to keep the make-up safe with most outfits. Use skin tones rather than more colorful additions.


For lipstick, select natural color tones that will highlight and plump your lips without changing their color dramatically. Glossy skin tones are perfect for cultivating the ulzzang look. You want to highlight and emphasize your own natural beauty, making it look effortless and simple.







, Generally, ulzzang style is notable for the use of skinny jeans of all colors, worn by both boys and girls.


Find the right fit and then get a variety of colors of a style that you like and that looks good on your body.

, T-shirts featuring unusual artistic prints, often off-center on the shirt, are quite popular. These types of shirts are widely available at clothing stores like Macy's, Kohls, and even Target.


Avoid overt brand stamps on shirts and choose shirts that feature cartoon characters or other artistic designs. Many popular shirt styles look as if they've been hand-made, screen printed and one-of-a-kind, with clever in-jokes or visual puns.

, The combination of tight-fitting jeans with loose sweaters is a marker of the ulzzang style. V-necks are popular, as well as regular-fit sweaters in bright colors or featuring prints of the same variety as ulzzang-style t-shirts.

, One unique aspect of online ulzzang culture is that it often revolves around photographs that feature the style of a cute-looking couple, usually wearing some kind of couple's outfit that matches in some kind of theme.


Wear matching colors or complimentary colors, rather than wearing identical outfits. Often ulzzang style clothes are sold in couple packs. Wearing ""I love my girl"" and ""I love my boy"" t-shirts together, or wearing corresponding heart necklaces is common among ulzzang photos.

, Generally, the cut is similar for boys or girls, featuring layers of hair and side-swept bangs. Some highlights are also common, but shouldn't be severe or particularly dramatic. Natural hair-color is more desirable than, say, blue anime-style highlights.

Boys typically have a medium-length cut with side-swept bangs, longer somewhat in the front than in the back.






Girls often have straight bangs or side-swept bangs with either straight or loosely curled hair. Generally, the hair is dark brown or chestnut-colored, as opposed to blonde.







, There's no universal haircut for beauty. Talk to your hairstylist and pick one that will flatter your unique beauty and features, emphasizing your jawline and the shape of your face. It's less important to get a particular haircut than to get one that looks good on you.

, Ulzzang styled hair is generally very healthy-looking and shimmering, highlighting the natural beauty of your coloring. Use fortifying shampoo and conditioner, as well as regular brushings to keep your hair healthy.


Be careful of using too much heat on your hair, which can fry it some and leave it frazzled looking and damaged. Let the natural oils in your hair do their work.







, Ulzzangs don't have perfect features, but know how to dress well and utilize technology to make their pictures look as attractive as possible. Get a good quality cellphone with a camera and the right apps to make your pictures as sharp as possible.PicLab HD only costs $1.99 and allows you to customize your filters and add type. It's a professional-looking way of taking ulzzang photos. HandyPhoto and Frametastic are also good cheap options offering similar features.






Facetune is a mobile photo-editing app that allows you to fix up blemishes and adjust coloring in your photos. Many ulzzang photos are heavily edited, so you might consider getting this if you don't have Photoshop.







, Cultivating an online presence that includes lots of cute-looking self portraits is an important part of ulzzang culture. Snap pictures of yourself out doing fun things, or shake up a dull evening by getting dressed up and having a photo shoot.


Use clothing catalogs and fashion magazines for inspiration. The social networking presence of the ulzzang looks like it was pulled straight from an Eddie Bauer catalog. Plan cute photo shoots with your partner when you're out on a date.

, Soompi, a K-Pop and South Korean culture site, has a regular Ulzzang contest featuring a prestigious package for the winners, including an audition and interview with major South Korean fashion magazines. Many more informal contests are also available on Facebook and other social networking sites.

",How to Make Clothes Look Vintage and Worn," The processes set out in this article are not designed to change the size; they are designed to change the appearance.



Wash the clothes thoroughly before proceeding. This will assure that bleeding and shrinkage has taken place before antiquing the clothing.;
, Since you'll be cutting, slashing, and attacking your clothes, use an area where damage won't be an issue and where the surface is strong. Good choices include an old gardening bench, a concrete garage floor, or outside somewhere.

, At this stage, decide how much damage you're willing to inflict on the clothing to change its appearance. If you're reticent, put the item away, as the changes will be permanent.


This is a good opportunity to plan the appearance changes that you'd like to make. Sketch or write down your hoped-for outcome and match the methods to the desired look.

, An aged t-shirt is a great starter project because t-shirts don't cost a lot and yet can be made to look fantastic when antiqued. Some suggestions for aging them include:


A broken-in and worn away look: Cut away the sleeves or neckline. Once you start the cut, stop using the scissors and simply tear away the rest of the fabric. This will you give your t-shirt that ""curled"" look.
Really aged look: A more aged look can be achieved by using sandpaper.Find sandpaper of about 100 grit or heavier. Rub it over the t-shirt in the places where you'd like it to appear more aged; the sandpaper will fray the fibers and make the shirt softer and more worn in appearance. An electric sander also works well and makes for faster results. Be sure to sand the edges of the shirt along the cuts, or along the neck, arm and waistline.

, This is probably the best known fabric subjected to aging techniques in a wide variety of fashion styles.


Starting at the edges of the jeans, make small cuts along the top edges in line with the edge of the jeans. You don't need to go over every edge, just nick the fabric enough to allow it to fray during washing. A razor, X-acto knife or utility knife works best. Use caution to avoid cutting yourself.







Rip jeans for the ultimate distressed look. Make a small cut and then tear with your hands. Ask for help from someone stronger if this proves difficult for you!






For torn knees or other torn areas such as the thighs: Try on the jeans, and with a pencil or sewing marker, make a horizontal mark across the front of your knee while you're sitting. Remove the jeans and make a small hole along the line big enough to fit in a finger or two. Rip the jeans the remainder of the desired width. Knees and thighs tend to show highest wear on normally wearing jeans.
When grating, sanding or filing the jeans, place a block of wood inside the leg. That way, if you grate, sand, or file too hard, you won't press through to the other side of the leg.Learn how to ""Ladder"" Jeans.

, As explained for aging t-shirts, worn areas can be made by using sandpaper (100 grit or heavier) along the butt, other knee, sides or near the pockets of many fabrics. This process is much faster if you have an electric sander. Just be sure to use a fabric that can withstand this pressure; clearly a fabric such as silk or satin will respond poorly.

, In many instances, the previous steps will prepare the fabric but won't necessarily fray or change the color of the item. For that, you'll need to wash them. Once you have snipped, sliced or torn, put all of your items in the washing machine and wash on medium heat with half laundry detergent and half borax or OxiClean.


The detergents will soften the water and assist the fraying process.
Dry the items completely in the dryer.
Examine the distressed areas. Fraying should begin in the the areas you've torn or sliced. If not, redo the above process and make the cuts deeper. If some fraying has begun and you want more, you can begin to tear and pull some of the strings to encourage more circumferential fraying.
A wire brush, grater or nail file can also assist in causing fraying. Alternatively, use a rasp over stones, such as stones inside a pocket.

, For a faded look, do not use bleach unless you know what you're doing. For best results: wash your clothes with detergent, find a secure place outside in a sunny area, hang your clothes right side out, and leave outside for up to two weeks. Make sure to move your clothes pins daily and rotate how the clothes hang, in order to avoid clothes pin (peg) lines or causing the item to become darker on one side. Your clothes will be stiff. Take your clothes inside and wash in warm water with detergent and borax or OxiClean. Dry in a dryer. Fabric softener can also be used.


If you want to use bleach, wear gloves and be very careful because every drip will cause fading; also, be prepared to work fast as bleach damages the fabric and the sooner you can wash it off, the better. Lay the jeans on an old towel or cloth that you don't use anymore (it will get stained too). If you don't want the back of the leg to look like the front, stuff the legs with plastic grocery bags to prevent the design leaking through to the other leg. Apply the bleach using a sponge rather than randomly dipping and squeezing. Use strokes with the sponge to create effects and avoid unwanted drips from the sponge. Work most on the areas you want to be faded the most. Turn the jeans over once you've done one side and do the other side. Then, wash in cold water using a normal cycle but exclude any other clothes. Dry as normal.Other alternatives include using a washcloth or a spray bottle in place of a sponge, for different effects; if spraying, wear goggles.







, There are a number of ""extreme"" methods that can be used for aging clothes. While these will take a little more strategy and should only be performed by a responsible adult, they can produce spectacular results providing that you accept that there is no guarantee of the end look nor even that your clothes will survive the punishing treatment! Some of the methods you might like to consider include:


Take your unworn jeans, jackets and shirts to the range for target practice. Fire a few rounds and you'll see awesome distressed looks on the garments. Just be sure to avoid the zippers. Wash them and wear.
Use a high power washer. Lay clothes on the pavement or against a wall and use the washer on them.
Use an axe. Hit clothes with the axe at varying angles.
Bury clothes in the yard for a few days.Cotton and wool seem to respond best, and for really distressed clothing (such as for Halloween or a spooky role play), add rotten pond water and leave for a few months.
Use the clothes in a tug of war with your dog.
Lay clothes across the driveway for a few days.
Roll around in a parking lot or other gritty or graveled surface with soft items such as leather.

, If you break major or supporting threads in the fabric when aging the clothing, tacking this portion back together using a rough or homely repair can add to the distressed look of the item.

Wear acid wash jeans.,
Try parachute pants.,
Find a ""Members Only"" jacket.,
Wear patterned sweaters.,
Try a preppier style.",How to Dress 80s Style2," Acid wash jeans were all the rage in the 80s, for both guys and girls. You can easily buy this style of jean, replete with bleach stains, rips and holes, or you can make your own for a fraction of the cost. You get extra points if the jeans are skinny and/or high-waisted!

, Parachute pants were tight, shiny, long-lasting pants made from the same material as (you guessed it) parachutes. Available in multiple colors and adorned with an excessive amount of zippers, these pants were a fashion must-have for guys in the 80s. Unfortunately, they have fallen out of fashion in recent years, so you may need to shop specialty stores or eBay to find a pair of your very own., ""Members Only"" jackets were the coolest brand-name item worn exclusively by the ""in-crowd"" in the 80s.—No knock-off versions or imitations were acceptable. Although they came in a variety of styles, the most popular had a poly/cotton exterior with a nylon lining and elasticated sleeves and waist. The brand is still going strong, but for true 80s street cred, look for a vintage ""Members Only"" jacket in thrift stores or online.

, For a more casual look, many guys were fond of ugly sweaters with bold geometric prints and patterns. The sweater should be pretty bulky and boxy looking and is ideally paired with a pair of high-waisted, light denim jeans and blindingly white sneakers.

, A more reserved, preppier style of clothing was popular with the smart, sophisticated, college-bound crowd in the 80s. This was less acid wash and neon and more polo shirts, dress pants and penny loafers. For an authentic 80s look, try popping the collar of your shirt and drape a pastel colored sweater casually around your shoulders."

Get big hair.,
Wear over-size earrings.,
Try fingerless gloves.,
Experiment with leg warmers.,
Wear brightly colored make-up.",How to Dress 80s Style3," The 80s was all about big hair - the taller, the wider and the crazier, the better. If you really want to commit, ask for an 80s style perm at your local hair salon, otherwise you can just aim for tons of volume through blow drying, teasing and lots and lots of hairspray!

, Massive earring are an 80s fashion must-have for both guys and girls - and it really is a case of ""the bigger the better"". Look for feathers, over-size crosses and enormous hoops that reach as far as your shoulders.

, Fingerless gloves hit the big-time in the 80s, mainly thanks to Madonna and her quirky, punk-rock fashion. Lace and leather are two popular materials, but really anything goes. You don't even need to worry about finding fingerless gloves in the store -- just cut the fingers off regular gloves for perfect 80s grunge., Wooly, neon-colored leg warmers are pretty much synonymous with the 1980s and the cast of Fame. Pair your legwarmers with some funky 80s style workout gear or your favorite heels and mini-skirt!

, Most 80s ladies did not go in for ""the natural look"" when it came to make-up. Women literally painted their faces with heavy pink blusher and bright blue and green eye shadows all the way to the eyebrows. Combine with lashings of blue mascara and eyeliner and your eyes are good to go. Next get some frosty pink lipgloss or blue/red lipstick and you'll look like you stepped straight out of the 80s!

Dress for luxury.,
Bring back the complicated undergarments.,
Style hair more loosely.,
Complete a feminine look with makeup.,
Add glasses.Horn rimmed glasses came out in 1947 and have been stylish ever since.,
Favor sportswear.,
Choose Hawaiian themes.",How to Dress in American 1940s Fashion2," As America eased into post-war prosperity after 1945, fashions became more elaborate and indulgent again. Here are a few examples of this trend.

Imitate the ""New Look"". Christian Dior's ""New Look"" silhouette, introduced in 1947, was a direct response to the wartime austerity look. It featured a tailored, pleated jacket with a nipped waist and a peplum (a small skirt emphasizing a narrow waist and wide hips) that flared out into a mid-calf length, full skirt made up of several folds. Instead of the leggy wartime look, the New Look emphasized the bust and hips in an hourglass figure. The outfit was usually completed with a hat, jewelry, gloves and a handbag or pocketbook, and it came in a variety of colors.






Wear cocktail attire. Cocktail attire, billed as more elegant than daywear but a step down from formal wear, became popular in the late 1940s for informal or early dinners. For women, this meant wearing dresses in sumptuous fabrics with a mid-calf or knee-length hem and including elements such as a low-cut bodice, a short bolero jacket, or a frothy skirt enhanced with tulle or chiffon. Additionally, high heels became higher and wedges were less popular.






Chose a period-appropriate suit. Menswear again became generously fitted after the war, featuring wide-leg trousers, shoulder pads and double-breasted jackets. Broad lapels and bold, coordinated accessories were promoted by Esquire magazine as the ""Bold Look."" Colors remained elegant and muted, with charcoal gray being popular.







, After the war and with the advent of fuller skirts, structural undergarments were necessary once more. Garters were used to hold up stockings, girdles helped achieve the popular ""nipped waist"" look, and petticoats were sometimes necessary to fill out skirts. Women were reluctant to give up the pants and shorts they'd enjoyed during the war, and retained them in slimmer, more feminine cuts. Sporty sweaters and jackets were fashionable for men.

, In response to the longer locks of the war, women again cut their hair shorter and kept it curled, or added bangs. Men wore hair with a ""wet"" look, achieved with pomade or cream, and combed back from the forehead or up into a pompadour.

, Postwar makeup remained similar to wartime makeup, with the exception of a less-bold lip. Liner and color followed a natural lip line, instead of the wartime ""Cupid's bow"" look. Instead, bright nail colors became popular.

, Eyeglasses became more “cat's eye” shaped for the ladies.

, As middle-class Americans began to enjoy more leisure time, sportswear became a popular element of US fashion.

, The boys were back home and they came with souvenirs. This led to a popularity in island themed fashions and home décor. Hawaiian themed parties were popular by the movie stars during the war and now the rest of the nation was catching up. Tropical prints were all the rage. Hawaiian shirts were the backyard BBQ favorite of the fellas.

Don’t forget about the shoes!",How to Dress Vintage," Vintage clothing, although there is no firm definition, is generally acknowledged as any clothing or accessory that was made in the 1980’s or earlier. Therefore, there is a huge selection of clothes to choose from in the ‘vintage’ category. Although it may be normal to gravitate towards one particular era, try mixing up your wardrobe with a variety of clothing periods. Wearing pieces that are all from the same era can make it look like you are in costume, rather than like you have a love for vintage.


The 1900’s were known for voluminous lace gowns, corsets, and collared tops.
The 1910’s brought about the trench coat and lace-up boots for women.
The 1920’s were famous for flapper and slip dresses in addition to glamorous beaded fascinators.
The 1930’s made wide brimmed hats and fur collars popular.
The 1940’s are known for cigarette-style pants, pastel sweaters, and halter tops.
The 1950’s made circle and poodle skirts, leather jackets, and unitards popular.
The 1960’s were known for bringing bell bottom jeans, paisley shirts, and peace signs into fashion.
The 1970’s brought denim and neutral tones into the spotlight, alongside pantsuits and leg warmers.
The 1980’s were famous for neon colors, shoulder pads, frilly and lacy tops, and tunics with leggings.;
, Although there are a select few people who can pull off an entirely vintage outfit, in order to keep your look chic rather than costume-y, it is important to keep your outfit about 50/50 modern and vintage. An easy way to think about it is: if you’re wearing a vintage top, throw on a pair of skinny jeans or modern pants. Vintage bottoms? Add a current shirt or sweater to balance the look. Dresses can be made more modern with the addition of modern accessories and hair styles.


Dressing in vintage doesn’t always have to be big pieces; wear a vintage scarf or piece of jewelry with an entirely modern outfit if you want.
When you get more comfortable in vintage, you may want to add more and more of it to your ensembles.

, Just because a piece is vintage, doesn’t mean that it’s in good condition (or style) to wear. If your vintage piece has any visible damage including stains, tears, or missing parts, it should be avoided until brought to a tailor or seamstress. Have all your vintage pieces dry-cleaned prior to wearing, as they often come with smells and wrinkles that are hard to get out on your own at home.


The same applies for wearing vintage pieces that are clearly not your size.

, Although not nearly as earth-friendly and story-filled, there are many stores that offer a selection of vintage-inspired but modern-made clothing pieces. These are a great alternative to true vintage, as you don’t have to worry so much about damaging them, they come in perfect condition, and they are already in a size guaranteed to fit you.

, Vintage shirts from nearly any era are the easiest way to step into the world of wearing vintage. Shirts and sweaters are relatively low-maintenance, and pair with any modern bottoms. Presently, it is very popular to pair a vintage top with skinny jeans and booties, alongside any other accessories you may want to add. You can also add a vintage cardigan or sweater to nearly any modern outfit without looking out-dated.


If you’re new to vintage, stay away from tops in the 70’s and 80’s, as these are still recent enough to look out of fashion if worn incorrectly.
You can easily buy a shirt or sweater that is too large and wear it with tight bottoms or a wide belt to make it look more flattering.

, Vintage skirts generally fall into two categories: full length/maxi, or knee length/midi. Up until the 80’s/90’s, skirts weren’t socially appropriate unless worn at the knee or below. In order to compensate for this length, make sure to wear a shirt that is clearly from 2000 or later. That being said, there is a huge variety of flattering vintage skirts on the market. Try styles like the circle skirt or an A-line skirt with tulle. Skirts are also easy to wear, as they don’t take much tailoring in order to be made to fit well.


Vintage skirts in any neutral tone (black, gray, brown, tan, and olive) are a great addition to your wardrobe.

, Vintage pants can be difficult to find, as sizing for pants has changed dramatically over the last century. Depending on how far back the pants were made, they may not even have a ‘size’ that we would recognize. However, if you are able to try on a few pairs and find some that fit, don’t hesitate at adding them to your closet! Try pairing vintage pants with a modern band tee or oversized knit sweater. Additionally, try tucking a lacy top or screen-printed tank for a bit of modern flare.

, Vintage dresses are fun to wear, for the main reason that there is such huge selection of well-fitting dresses available for purchase. Be on the lookout for dresses that can be easily accessorized to be made modern in appearance. This means that dresses with lots of embellishment and adornments can look too costume-y for regular wear. Dresses that are solid color, a mild print, or in good quality fabric can be put with boots/flats/sandals, a cute beanie or wide-brimmed hat, and a few pieces of modern jewelry., Not ready to take the full-outfit plunge yet? It’s easy to add a small vintage piece, like a scarf or a hat, to a totally modern outfit. Look for vintage turban hats and wide-brim hats (currently in style) to add to your favorite modern outfit. Silk scarves can be worn around the neck, or wrapped up to create a retro-inspired headband. Just be sure that these are in good condition when you buy them, because they cannot be easily (or cheaply) fixed or cleaned.

, Jewelry almost never goes out of style, so you can wear pieces of vintage jewelry without anyone knowing the difference. Look for big statement necklaces, bold bangles, and clip-on earrings for your outfits. Keep in mind that you don’t want your jewelry to be in competition, so only wear a single piece of bold jewelry at a time.

, Vintage shoes are one of the oft-overlooked pieces of vintage that can totally transform an outfit. The difficulty with vintage shoes, is finding a pair in good enough condition that they’ll be worth the purchase. Look for classic styles like lace-up boots and oxford flats (men’s or women’s!) to add to any modern outfit in your closet. When in doubt, stick to neutral tones in quality leather for a look that never goes out of style.

Stock up on wardrobe essentials.,
Show up in a suit.,
Jack up your look with a jacket.,
Try on a wool tweed jacket.,
Refine your look with shoes and accessories.,
Get the hair right.",How to Dress Rockabilly1," It doesn't take a lot of pieces or a lot of money to put together a rockabilly wardrobe. The look is pure working-class Americana with some flashes of swinger-chic.


Do it Dickies style. If there's one brand name synonymous with rockabilly style, it's Dickies. This line of work apparel offers basic pieces that speak to the rockabilly aesthetic. The classic rockabilly trousers are a pair of Dickies Original 874 work pants in black.
Grab some denim. Slim-cut (not skinny) dark jeans are another wardrobe staple. Be sure to buy them a couple of inches longer than you need so you can cuff them up.
Pick up a pack of T's. You can't go wrong sporting a thin white T-shirt with the sleeves rolled up and the hem tucked in to your pants; this is a staple of the rockabilly ""greaser"" look. Pick up some work shirts and western shirts to add a little flair to your wardrobe.;
, For dressier occasions, choose a slim-fit suit to show rockabilly style with class. Check that the suit jacket has a skinny collar, two or more buttons and a higher waistline. A sharkskin suit with its high sheen is a true attention-getter, but a good quality suit will set you back more than a few bucks. Scour thrift and vintage stores for this classic suit; if it's in good shape, fits well or can be easily altered, snap it up. Western suits are another way to add variety to your wardrobe and can be found easily online and in specialty stores.

, There are a variety of jackets that add that perfect layer of authenticity to a rockabilly look. Each will send a slightly different style message, so give it some thought and decide the right look for you.


The letter jacket. Remember when Danny gave Sandy his letter jacket in ""Grease?"" Give yourself a slightly preppy rockabilly look by picking up a letter jacket. They're easy to find at flea markets and vintage and thrift stores and give you your chance to be the big man on campus.
The motorcycle jacket. Yet another undisputed classic--the leather motorcycle jacket--is at the heart of the ""greaser"" look. Pick one up new or shop the thrift stores to score a well-worn but sturdy second-hand model.

, Convey a casual air with a wool tweed jacket. Look for a topper that features knit cuffs, collar and waist reasonably priced at thrift and vintage stores.


The shop jacket. Wear the shop jacket to work on your hot rod--or to look like you do. Navy, black, gray and olive green are the classic colors, but you don't have to stick to that. If you truly want to rock it old school, find a jacket with a name patch or plan to add one to yours.
The Western jacket. The Western jacket adds a little pizzazz to your look. The style is slim with a banded waist and cowboy snaps and ornate stitching.

, Shoes and accessories truly do complete your look and can solidify the direction of your style.


Give 'em the boot. Worn work boots or motorcycle boots are a no-brainer choice for this look. If you're going for a more of a ""swinger"" style, pick up a pair of wing tips or oxfords. If you consider yourself a fashion daredevil, chose a pair of creepers. These thick-soled platform shoes have been described as ""clunky"" and ""cinder block chic."" They have roots in the punk scene but fit right into a rockabilly wardrobe, especially those that sport plaids, polka dots or flames. They should be easy to find--they're a major fall 2013 fashion statement.Accessorize to suit your style. Add a skinny tie with a tie tack or tie bar to a suit and consider a pair of cufflinks (think dice, hot rods or playing card motifs). Buddy Holly-style glasses (get clear lenses if your vision is 20/20)can give you a rockin' edge, and nothing complements a basic white T better than a pack of smokes rolled up in the sleeve.

, Perhaps the most popular men's hairstyle of the the 1950s--the pompadour--is the totally today look of a rockabilly man. When the style first became popular, men used cream to slick the hair down and give it a wet look, which earned them the nickname ""Greasers.""


Wear a pompadour. GQ describes the pompadour as ""Shorn on the sides and back, long enough on top to be swept forward and back onto itself, the whole thing looks like one big, bold whoosh! sound effect.""To get your pompadour on, be sure your hair is cut properly--short on the sides and in the back with a top that starts short in the back and gets longer as the hair moves forward.
Rub some pomade or wax in your hands to warm it up and slick the product evenly through the sides and back of your hair. Comb the sides back and the back straight down; keep the hair as close to the scalp as possible.
Warm up some more wax and apply it to the top of your hair. Create a side part by combing this section in a diagonal starting from the back and working toward the front. Flip the front up and back to give it some height."

Before you put the cat eye liner, put on an understated eyeshadow color that is slightly lighter than your skin tone. Then, rest your elbows on a flat surface and carefully line your eyes, not too thick, and be steady. It takes practice at first, but the results are worth it! When you have reached near the end, do a little curve, a small sweep for the full effect.
Leave the under-eyes free of anything. Shades of white eyeshadows are an exception. No colorful,tropical or trendy eyeshadow.

, Femme fatales don't wear casual flat shoes or runners. A femme fatale is always dressed to the nines. Her shoes are always high: marabou mules, stilettos and platforms (not the 70s ones or the stripper ones), and look for some embellishments like feathers (marabou or ostrich), texture, animal print or rhinestones.
, When it comes to hosiery, a femme fatale is always in fine, black mesh fishnets and/or seamed stockings. Avoid leggings, pantyhose, or opaque tights.

A femme fatale usually wears elegant, long opera gloves. They can be satin, silk, lace and/or velvet. Shorter gloves gloves are also acceptable in the daytime.





When it comes to lingerie, it's all about the black,silk and lace. The wasp waist completes the femme fatale look. Invest in a girdle and/or corset if needed.Femme fatale clothes need base garments. Corsets are a very good option; wear one as a foundation garment or as part of your outer wear. Avoid ""basic"" and boring cotton underwear.

, When out in the daytime, a femme fatale always wears dark sunglasses possible.It can be retro cat-eyes or big Jackie-O ones; whichever suits your face shape best as long as no one sees your eyes.
, Something with structure and flatters your face shape, preferably decorated with a veil, jewels, furs or feathers. A good example is a veiled pillbox hat., You don't have to smoke to be a femme fatale—in fact, modern day etiquette dictates that you should not. If you do, however, use a cigarette holder.
, Make it your signature scent—you want to be remembered.
, Go for diamonds, diamonds, diamonds! Make sure they are big enough to be seen far away.
, (Listen to her voice here) This is the cherry on top to becoming a femme fatale. Lower your voice and do some voice exercises.

Tuck a ruffled blouse into a pencil skirt.,
Choose a simple shoe.,
Minimize your accessories.",How to Wear Ruffles1," Ruffles that travel in a horizontal line, from shoulder to shoulder, draw attention to your bust and create the illusion of fullness. On the other hand, ruffles that travel in a narrow line down your front may only make you look flatter.;
, A line of ruffles down the center of your blouse draws the eye up and down, rather than side to side, which may prevent the ruffle detailing from making your chest look any larger. You should avoid horizontal ruffles, however, since these may end up making you look top heavy.

, If you feel self-conscious about a large bust or mid-section, skip the ruffled blouse and opt for another ruffled piece, like a skirt or an accessory. Ruffles draw the eye, giving it a focal point, so any place you wear a ruffle will automatically garner extra attention.

, If you are not certain about how ruffles along your front look, opt for a safer bet and look for a blouse with small ruffles trimming the sleeves or lower hem. These details add a fun, feminine twist to your blouse without looking too fashion forward.

, The best way to wear the free-flowing ruffle is by pairing it with structured pieces. A structured jacket, like a boyfriend blazer, adds a chic amount of masculine contrast to an ultra feminine style.

, Wearing a ruffled blouse with a skirt maximizes the amount of femininity you can get from the look. A pencil skirt flatters most figures and provides just enough structure to keep free-flowing ruffles in line.

, A riding boot or edgy platform contrasts nicely against the soft look of ruffles, while a delicate heel plays into the natural sense of girlishness.

Create a clean canvas.",How to Dress Rockabilly2," Rockabilly gals have a way of looking sexy but sweet, combining some girls-only pieces with items that look like they came from their boyfriend's closet.


Show some skin. Wear a classic halter top or dress (no tanks or spaghetti-strap styles) that ties at the neck or features thick straps and a sweetheart neckline or ruching at the bust. You can find vintage versions in resale shops or new styles made modern with fabrics that have cherry, tropical or even skull designs. They're a great way to show off and yet soften the look of tattooed skin.
Rock a high waist. High-waisted pencil skirts and ankle-length pants have a retro, rockabilly feel, especially when paired with a menswear-style dress shirt with rolled up sleeves and a knot tied in the front.
Let it swing. A full skirt with some ""swing"" to it offers a lot of versatility to a rockabilly wardrobe. The Rockabilly wrap dress is a must for dancing--the skirt will flow with every step, twist and turn. To turn a rockabilly guys head, choose a Sweetheart dress, which a full skirt, a fitted and belted waist and a lightly puffed sleeve that falls to about the elbow. One bit of warning--stay away from the poodle skirt. You'll look like you're wearing a costume rather than embracing an alternative style.

, Stay true to the style but add your personal stamp to the look with shoes and accessories. The things you'll need are timeless, which makes them easy to find and gives you lots to choose from.

, Shiny black or red Mary Janes in a flat or high heel can work with almost all rockabilly gal looks. For a more preppy, casual look, choose loafers or saddle shoes with or without bobby socks or a pair of Converse All Stars.

, Consider tattoo-inspired necklaces, leopard print or hounds-tooth purses, headbands and small classic earrings. For another way to enhance that sexy-but-sweet vibe, add a flower to your hair;go with a red rose or a large vibrant flower that matches the color of your outfit.

, If you choose a classic rockabilly hairstyle, you can go two ways--stick strictly to the look or modernize a bit by following the style but making everything looser and using lighter-weight styling products.


Try a feminine version of the pompadour. While the pompadour hairstyle has come to be most closely associated with men, never forget that it was named after a woman (Madame de Pompadour). If you have longer hair, pull it up into a high ponytail and wrap it around a large-barrel curling iron for 30 or so seconds to create a spiral. Then, back-comb your bangs and pin the ends down near your ponytail to create the pomp. You can also create a pompadour front and add a large flower barrette to finish off the look. Short-haired gals can wear a pompadour just like their male counterparts (see directions above) or create a pin-curl look a la Rizzo in ""Grease.""
Embrace the '40s. 1940s hairstyles are worn by rockabilly fans more than 1950s styles. Betty Page and her victory rolls are seen everywhere at rockabilly concerts and events.

, The rockabilly look comes with a distinctive makeup style so proper application is key to an authentic appearance.

, Use a liquid or cream foundation to even out your complexion and dust it lightly with finishing powder. Apply blush sparingly on your cheekbones rather than the apples of your cheeks.


Create a cat eye. The cat eye defines the makeup look for a rockabilly gal. The process of creating the cat eye may seem a little overwhelming at first--there are a number of steps--but you'll get better and faster with practice. Or you may decide to short-cut the steps a bit to create a modified version of the look.

Gently pull your eyelid up and line the inner rim with a few coats of jet-black waterproof pencil. Then line the inner rim of your lower lash line and finally your upper lash line. Blend color into lashes with an angled brush.
With a black liquid-liner pen, make four evenly spaced dashes over the pencil line on your upper lash line and connect them.
Close your eye and use your finger to trace along the crease of your upper lid, moving outward. When it meets the bony part of your eye, mark the spot with a dot of liquid liner. Place the tip of the liquid-liner pen on the dot and drag it to the outer corner of your eye, thickening the line as you go. This creates the ""winged"" look of the cat eye.
Once the liner is dry, dab your lid with a cream-colored liquid eye shadow. Use a metallic version on the area just above your crease line and inner corner. The metallic shadow updates the look, and the liquid formula stands up well to heat.
Finish with two coats of black mascara or a pair of false eyelashes.


Be the lady in red. Outline your lips using a red lip pencil. To keep the look from being dated, just use the pencil to define your ""cupid's bow"" and the center of your bottom lip. Apply a bright red lipstick with a blue (cool) undertone and a matte finish.

Then take the very back section of your hair and hold it straight up. Backcomb it from the midsection to your scalp to give it extra volume. Lay your hair back down on your head and comb the top of your hair to smooth it.

, If you already have a mop top style haircut with long bangs and hair that falls to the ears and just touches your shoulders in the back, maintain it by adding product and straightening it. If you have curly or wavy hair, use a straightening iron to straighten it, then add mousse or styling product and work it through your hair for a little extra volume. Instead of wearing your bangs to the side, comb them straight down so that they cover your eyebrows.This is a boyish look that was popularized by The Beatles in the early stages of their career.

, To do this late 50’s, early 60’s hairstyle, make sure you are working on damp hair. Apply a hair cream or gel to give your hair extra texture, pushing the hair backward and working the product through your hair.

Add volume to your hips with ruffled tiers.,
Look for ruffles along the lower hem if you have broader hips.,
Avoid ruffled skirts if you feel self-conscious about your legs.,
Pair ruffled skirts with simple, fitted tops.,
Consider leggings.,
Stick with a simple shoe.,
Accessorize with caution.",How to Wear Ruffles2," If you have narrow hips, a skirt with tiered ruffles is a good way to create the illusion of volume.

, Ruffles directly on the hip will likely make your hips look even wider, but a small amount of ruffle detailing at the bottom hem of a knee-length or maxi skirt will draw the eye away from your hips and toward the ruffle. As a result, your legs may appear more balanced.

, If you feel dissatisfied with both your thighs and your calves, a ruffled skirt will only make you feel more self-aware of these problematic features. If you have issues with your legs, skip the ruffled skirt and opt for a ruffled top to draw the focus someplace else.

, A simple fitted tank top or t-shirt creates a chic casual look, while a fitted button-down shirt gives your look structure and class. Stick with solid colors since patterns would likely compete with your attention-getting skirt.

, Leggings are a trendy item and work especially well in the cooler months of winter, late fall, and early spring. They also provide an added boost of structure that contrasts well with a ruffled skirt. Stick with black or dark brown leggings and avoid bright colors or patterns, since these are more likely to clash.

, A belted ankle boot gives your style an edgy twist, but a simple ballet flat can keep your outfit looking soft and feminine.

, With your ruffles restricted to your lower half, necklaces and earrings are less likely to create a problem, but you should still keep them simple and subdued. Avoid belts, bulky bracelets, and rings, since these items are closer to your skirt and may create more of an issue.

Use ruffles to balance out your curves.,
Be careful about ruffles that travel the full length of the dress.,
Try on a pair of sexy, strappy shoes.,
Match your ruffled dress with a simple kitten heel or flat.,
Keep your accessories to a minimum.",How to Wear Ruffles3,"


If you have perfectly proportioned hourglass curves, look for a dress that has ruffled trims along the collar, sleeves, and bottom hem to avoid throwing your curves out of proportion.
If one area of your body is smaller in proportion than another, look for a dress that places ruffles over that portion. For instance, if you have a small bust and wide hips, look for horizontal ruffles that add volume and detail to your bust.

, Some women may be able to pull this look off, but for many, the ruffles are bound to cross over a problem area they would rather mask. If you have a rectangle body type, however, a tiered ruffle dress may provide a welcome increase in volume.

, Ruffled dresses can look girlish, but a sultry high heeled sandal may give your look the spice it needs to boost it into womanliness.

, Many ruffled dresses have a naturally sweet appearance, and a cute flat or kitten heel can coordinate well with that sweetness without pushing the cuteness over the top.

, A ruffled dress may put even more ruffles on your body than a blouse or skirt. Avoid embellishment overkill by sticking with one or two extremely simple pieces of jewelry, like pearl post earrings or a delicate choker necklace.

Try a ruffle-trimmed boot.,
Consider a flat with ruffle detailing above the toes.,
Look for a ruffled scarf.,
Throw a ruffled jacket or cardigan over a simple outfit.,
Carry a ruffled handbag.",How to Wear Ruffles4," Some suede and leather ankle boots have a pretty ruffle trim along the top. Match these boots with simple pencil or A-line skirt, since pants may hide the ruffle from sight.

, This trim may come as a single row of ruffles at the opening of the shoe, or there may be multiple rows of ruffles. Match these flats with jeans and a simple blouse to give your style a subtle twist of feminine charm.

, Fashion scarves are highly trendy and add a nice splash of color and pattern to an otherwise plain dress or ensemble. A ruffled scarf uses elastic to create the appearance of draping ruffles throughout the length of the scarf.

, Some styles may have ruffles along the front opening, while others may have a little along the wrists or collar. Match these pieces with simple garments like fitted tank tops, skinny jeans, and pencil skirts.

, A shoulder bag with a ruffled design on it is an effective way to add ruffles to your style without worrying about drawing attention to any particular part of your body. Leave this purse behind when you decide to wear a busy outfit, however, since the ruffles on your bag could still clash with other patterns and embellishments on your clothing.

A patchwork print will be more subtle if you choose a design that features the same two or three colors so there’s less contrast.;
, Because a patchwork print often features several different types of patterns, it can be tricky to wear it with other patterned clothing. Instead, pair your patchwork print with solids for a look that’s polished and not too busy.If the patchwork print is particularly colorful, it’s best to pair it with neutral solids, such as black, white, brown, or gray.
If the patchwork print is made up of solid color blocks, you can try pairing it with patterns. However, it’s best to stick to simple patterns, such as stripes or checks.

Carry a book.",How to Wear the Sexy Librarian Look," A white blouse works best, but a solid color may also work if you opt for dull shades over vibrant ones. Choose a simple, “no-nonsense” blouse with a collar. Small ruffles are fine, but avoid large frills, bows, or other similar elements. Leave the top few buttons undone., It can be a full-length or three-quarter sleeve cardigan, and if you don’t have one that buttons down you can use one that doesn’t open in the front. The key with this item is to make sure that it sits comfortably around your shoulders.Alternatively, you can wear the cardigan. Keep the buttons undone to increase your sex appeal.

, Black and gray skirts are ideal, though you may choose from either a solid print or subtle pinstripes. If you are unable to find a black or gray skirt, choose another neutral color in a solid print, like beige or dark brown. Avoid bright colors and bold patterns.Keep the length at the knee-level or just above. A shorter skirt makes the look too bold, but a longer skirt reduces the sex appeal.

, Choose dark pantyhose, such as black or dark brown, matched to the color of your skirt. You can also choose a lace pair for added drama. The idea is to draw attention to the fact that you have nylons on, so avoid flesh-tones., Pumps are a great option for this look. Again, black or dark brown colors work best, and you should avoid bold, flashy colors. Pick a heel height you feel comfortable with. The way you strut your stuff matters just as much as the clothes themselves. If you feel uncomfortable with tall heels, opt for shorter heels you can walk around in confidently., This look is great if you have short, as in chin-length, hair. Make your hair as smooth and straight as possible, and avoid adding any ""cutesy"" curls or flips.


Tuck a pencil behind your ear to really play up the librarian look.

, Pulling your hair back into a tight ponytail works especially well if you have medium (shoulder-length) hair. Whether you have straight or curly hair, gather as much of it as possible and tightly pull it into a low ponytail at the base of your neck. Use bobby pins to secure any loose strands in place.

, A bun is a great way to get the sexy librarian look. This style works well with longer hair, such as below the shoulder. Slick your hair back before twisting it into a bun to achieve a no-nonsense look. Secure the bun with bobby pins., Be sure to choose a shade that matches your skin color exactly. Apply it sparingly, and choose a light blush to put on the apples of your cheeks., Apply a thin line of dark eyeliner to your upper and lower lids. You want to make your eyes stand out but your lips will be the focal point so avoid creating a smoky eye., Play up your lashes by adding a couple coats of mascara. Choose a black shade if you have darker lashes, or go with brown-black if you have fair lashes.

, Be sure to pick one that compliments your skin tone. This is the one aspect of your look where a bright pop of color is desirable. Wear a bright red lipstick if you think you can pull it off. Otherwise, choose a deeper red.Stay within the red color range if possible, since red connotes passion and seduction more clearly than pinks and beiges.
Because deep red colors of lipstick tend to bleed easily, make sure to apply a lip liner in a matching color to secure the color in place.
A matte or moisturizing lipstick is more complimentary to this conservative look than a glossy coat.

, Glasses are a must for the sexy librarian look. Rectangular lenses work best, but oval lenses are also fine. If you do not own a own pair, purchase a pair of cheap reading glasses from a drugstore. If you don’t need prescription glasses for near- or farsightedness, purchase a pair that has non-prescription lenses in them.Cat-eye glasses also work well for this look as they create a vintage, old-fashioned feel.
If you don’t need to wear the glasses at all times, consider getting a chain that attaches to the ends of the handles so you can dangle the glasses around your neck.

, For this look, less is more. Choose a single strand of pearls to wear around your neck, or wear a few simple bangle bracelets. Add simple studs or pearl earrings.


Avoid flashy or trendy jewelry and jewelry with large charms.

, Librarians carry lots of books, so choose a large bag to accessorize your outfit. Something tasteful and classic, like a brown or black leather shoulder bag, would be perfect.

, Librarians are constantly surrounded by books, so it makes sense to carry one with you. Put a few in your bag or carry one in your hand. Choose your favorite novel or pick a classic, like A Tale of Two Cities, Anna Karenina, or Crime and Punishment.

Don't wear plaid pants unless you're supremely confident.",How to Wear Plaid," Plaid comes in many different colors and styles. However, its crisscrossing lines mean it's almost always fairly attention-grabbing. This means pairing multiple pieces of plaid clothing with each other can be overwhelming or ""busy"" to look at.


There's one exception to this rule. If you have one plaid accessory (like a scarf, purse, hat, pair of shades, etc.) that's designed to match your main plaid piece, you can usually get away with wearing both together.;
, This is a great ""go-to"" style choice when you're trying to add plaid to your wardrobe. Solid colors offer simple contrast to the complicated interwoven patterns of plaid. On top of this, neutral tones are versatile in terms of which plaid patterns they can pair with. Not every plaid shirt will pair with bright yellow chinos, for instance, but most will pair with a simple pair of jeans or khakis quite nicely.



Neutral colors include: White, black, khaki, muted blue denim, grey, and most browns and beiges., You don't always have to wear plaid with neutral tones. However, if you want to wear plaid with colored clothes, try to pick a plaid piece with one color that is close to the other color in your outfit.


For example, if you're wearing a set of bright blue jeans, you might wear a plaid shirt that includes a few stripes that are a similar shade of blue. The colors don't have to match exactly — light blue can go with dark blue and so on., Today, clothing sellers offer plaid garments in a huge variety of colors and shades. This means that you have lots of freedom when it comes to assembling your outfit. As long as you're following the color-matching rules above, there aren't any strict rules here, but a few general suggestions are below.



Brighter, more flowery shades tend to be best for casual events and warmer months.

Darker, more muted shades tend to be more formal and more appropriate for colder weather. For example, you would probably not wear pink plaid to a job interview, but navy blue plaid might work well.

Intricately-stitched patterns can give an upscale, intellectual vibe, especially when paired with a smart jacket and nice shoes.

Simple, bright-colored plaids give a very rugged, blue-collar impression. For example, Paul Bunyan and other ""traditional"" lumberjacks are often depicted in bright red and black plaid shirts.

, Plaid is the name of the pattern (not the material) so you can find plaid items in a variety of materials. In general, you'll want to find something that's just right for the weather outside — not too hot, not too cold. A few seasonal suggestions are below:



Spring: Light cotton or flannel shirts, umbrellas, stockings, hats, shoes.

Summer: Light cotton shirts (tied around waist when hot), skirts, shorts, jumpers, tees.

Autumn: Heavier flannel shirts, rain boots, trench coats, hats.

Winter: Heavy flannel shirts, jackets, boots, scarves.

, Not all plaids are created equal. Though all plaids use the famous crisscross pattern, a huge variety of colors, styles, and sizes are available. A few pattern suggestions are listed below:Tartan: Large, old-fashioned looking pattern. Usually dark green background with navy blue, yellow, and red crisscrosses. Good for scarves, blankets.

Tattersall: Small, tight, square patterns. Thin lines of color on a neutral background. Looks very clean and modern. Works well for semi-casual dress shirts.

Madras: Wide, colorful striped pattern. Usually incorporates bright, ""flowery"" colors. Good for flowing garments like dresses or loose flannel shirts.

Gingham: Two-color ""checkerboard"" pattern. Thick, regular stripes. Works well for a retro, folksy look.

, Your outfit is more than your top and bottom garments. Wearing plaid accessories is a great way to give a burst of color to outfits that are dying to look a little more vibrant. However, remember that it's not a good idea to wear more than one piece of plaid at once unless the pieces match exactly.



Possible plaid accessories include: hats, scarves, stockings, socks, purses, backpacks, shades, neckties, bowties, handkerchiefs, and much more.

, Women's flannel shirts can offer a wide range of fashion possibilities depending on how they fit and how you wear them. Pick the style that gives the impression you want to broadcast to the world! See below:Loose plaid shirts tend to appear more ""rugged"" and casual. Try pairing one with a band T-shirt or an old tank top for a grungy sense of style. You can even wear men's shirts and let the tails hang below the waist for a ""boyfriend"" look.

Fitted plaid shirts and blouses tend to appear more ""put-together"" and professional. These are great for a semi-casual look at the home or the office.

, Love your plaid shirt but can't figure out how to work it into your outfit? There's no rule that says you have to wear it as a shirt. Try tying it around your waist as a sash or belt to add a line of bright color to your outfit that attracts attention to your waist.


As an alternative, you can tie your shirt in a loop and wear it diagonally across your chest or tie the sleeves around your neck like a sweater.

, This easy look is fantastic as an ""anywhere"" outfit. Pair it with a set of a clean (yet casual) shoes like flats for a touch of refinement or try sneakers for spunky style.


You may want to keep jewelry and flashy accessories to a minimum with this outfit. These sorts of additions can clash with the casual aims of the rest of your clothes.

, It's also easy to use plaid to give the opposite impression. Try wearing a fitted plaid tunic or dress over a pair of dark leggings. Then, wrap a scarf or belt around your waist and add a few gold accessories, such as necklaces, bracelets, or earrings, for a touch of class. Finish it off with a pair of fashionable heeled boots. You'll have red carpet style on a fraction of the budget.

, No one's too old for this playful yet traditional outfit. Start by picking a plaid skirt with muted colors like navy glue, forest, green, or a neutral color. Then, pair it with a plain white button-down shirt for simple elegance. Wear a pair of black knee-high socks and throw on some simple black flats to complete the look.

, Women have tons of awesome options when it comes to plaid accessories. Look for a plaid handbag, scarf, or belt at your favorite outlet. Then, for maximum impact, add the accessory to a simple plaid-free outfit that only uses solid prints like to a white t-shirt and jeans. The contrast between the accessory and the rest of your clothes will naturally make it an eye-catcher.


Some famous labels, like Burberry, offer iconic plaid patterns on their accessories. These are great, but you don't have to spend lots of money to get this look. The visual contrast is what's important, not the price tag.

, When it comes to plaid fashion for men, the idea of ""ruggedness"" is a popular one. To get this rugged, masculine look, pick a long-sleeved flannel shirt in traditional colors, like red and black or gray and black. Wear it with your most comfortable jeans and a pair of hiking boots. That's all you need!


White or black tees are the perfect undershirts for this no-frills outfit. You can even try showing off a hairy chest by wearing a tank top — if you're going for the lumberjack look, you might as well flaunt it!

, Brighter plaids aren't just for women. Bright plaid flannels go good with a tee shirt and jeans or shorts for a casual beach-bum look. Alternatively, pair a bright plaid dress shirt with a pair of khakis or grey dress pants for a bold, semi-formal outfit.

, Depending on their fit, a pair of plaid shorts can have a wide range of effects. Try picking either a baggy or fitted pair of shorts depending on the situation. See below:



Baggy plaid shorts usually give a more casual, relaxed impression. Pair with a fitted tee or a solid dress shirt for best results.

Fitted plaid shorts usually give a slightly classier impression. They're still more casual than pants, but they're more connected to ""upper-crust"" sports activities like golf. Try pairing with a solid-color polo.

, Sometimes a small amount of tie in the right place can make a big impression. If you only want a subtle hint of plaid in your outfit, put on a plaid print tie the next time you wear a suit. The pattern will liven up your style without looking too tacky or overdone. Both neck ties and bow ties work well. However, plaid ties aren't usually appropriate for especially formal events.


Be sure to use a subdued, solid-color shirt under the tie. Patterned shirts can make your upper body look very ""busy"" when paired with a complicated plaid tie.

, Using plaid patterns for suits is do-able, but only if the plaid pattern is a subtle one. Suits that are bold about their plaid patterns are a relic of the 1970s. They can be visually distracting at best and can make you look like a game show host at worst. Pick plaid suits with very thin, subtle stitching and neutral colors to play things safe.


As a general rule, if a plaid suit looks like a solid color suit until you get close to it, it's probably safe.

, This is worth repeating. One of the very worst things you can do with plaid is to wear lots of it. The best plaid outfits generally have one prominent plaid item. Outfits that do use multiple plaid items generally have them matching exactly and use neutral tones to keep the plaid from overwhelming the outfit, but even this is a difficult feat to pull off.


Pairing two different kinds of plaid in the same outfit is almost always a bad idea. With the complex, interlocking patterns of the plaid and the many colors involved, it's almost impossible to get the two items to match. Even if you do, the effect can be overwhelming.

, Though it isn't always outright informal, plaid isn't usually considered especially dignified. There are usually much better choices for dressing respectfully. Unless you've been given special dress code instructions, it's better to stick to a suit, tuxedo, dress, or gown for events like weddings, funerals, and so on.


A good rule of thumb is this: if the event is something you feel like you need to wear a suit or dress for, don't wear plaid (even if it's part of your suit or dress).

, For the same reason that it's a bad idea to wear multiple different kinds of plaid, you won't usually want to wear plaid along with bright colors (either prints or solid colors). For instance, pairing plaid with neon-colored fabric is sure to make your outfit an over-complicated eyesore. Remember: neutral tones are your friends when it comes to plaid.

, One of the best things about plaid is that it's easy to get great-looking plaid prints for cheap at thrift stores. Plaid gets a somewhat appealing ""weathered"" look as it ages. This makes a plaid shirt that was once intended as semi-formal wear or work clothing, for instance, perfect for a ""grungy"" ensemble in a few decades' time. Save money on your next shopping trip by visiting a second hand store and digging around for these sorts of plaid bargains.

, For reasons that are difficult to define, bold plaid pants often look bizarre and distracting even when a shirt of the same print would not. While haute couture fashion models may be able to pull off plaid pants, 99% of the world's population can't, so you'll probably want to steer clear.

Match your makeup to the overall look, too.",How to Wear Chiffon Pants," Most chiffon pants are wide-leg palazzo pants. As a lightweight fabric that drapes well, chiffon adds elegance and shape to the otherwise boxy cut of the palazzo style.


You may even have trouble if you want to find chiffon pants cut to any other form. Chiffon is a material that doesn't have much structure on its own, so it is ill-suited for clothing meant to give shape and form to your body.
Wide-leg palazzo pants, on the other hand, have very little shape and can take full advantage of the breezy, easy-going sophistication of chiffon.;
, As with any garment, you need to make sure that the pants fit you properly. The surest way to verify an accurate fit is to try the pants on and take a good look at your legs in a full length mirror.


Chiffon pants are sized like any other style of trouser, so start by selecting a pair in your usual size.
If they fit correctly, the pants should fit snugly around your natural waist (the thinnest part of your mid-section) and drape down over the entire length of your leg, falling out around the ankle. The wide leg should not hug the curves of your leg too closely, so if you see any stretching down the length of the leg, that particular pair of pants might be too small.

, Before you buy a pair of chiffon pants or wear them around town, you should look at yourself in a full length mirror under bright light. Since chiffon is so light, it also tends to be see-through. Looking at yourself under a bright light will let you see how much can be viewed through the material.


Most clothing manufacturers take appropriate measures to allow you to show off your legs without showing off your unmentionables. Chiffon pants usually have a second short, inner layer near the top that covers the hip and upper thigh area.
Nonetheless, the wrong pair of chiffon pants can still produce a visible panty line, so checking the appearance is a good idea.
It's also best to wear white or nude colored undergarments beneath the chiffon pants since bright or dark colors can easily show through.

, Chiffon pants come in a wide range of colors and prints. When shopping for your first pair, you should think about where you plan to wear the pants and what you want them to say about your personal style.


If you want to ease your way into the style, consider white or black chiffon pants. White pants can look both casual and dressy depending on what you wear them with, so they'll offer you the most versatility. Black chiffon pants are a little more difficult to dress down, but they can create a look ranging between sexy and elegant.
For the more adventurous fashionistas, consider a pair of chiffon pants in a bright color or a bold print. You can find chiffon palazzo pants in colors like fire engine red and patterns like leopard print., Chiffon palazzo pants naturally elongate the appearance of your legs. To get the most benefit from this effect, wear high-waist tops or cropped tops that allow the full length of the pants to remain visible.


Try to look for a cropped top that lands directly at your natural waist—the skinniest part of your mid-section.
Another high-waist option that works well with chiffon pants is the tie-front blouse., If the top you plan to wear with your chiffon pants extends a little further than desired, consider tucking it in. Doing so still raises the position of your visible waist, making your legs look even longer as a result.


Tucking your shirt in also draws the material closer to your body, which highlights and flatters your figure, too.

, Since chiffon pants have a loose, flowing appearance, you should balance it out by wearing tops that are more structured and form-fitting.


Tank tops and other form-fitting sleeveless shirts are great for this purpose since they add as little bulk to the top of your body as possible and show off your curves.
If you're feeling especially daring, you could even try wearing a body suit. The lower half will be masked by the chiffon pants, leaving only the upper half visible.

, Layered tops are a good way to add visual interest and structure to the top half of your body in a way that balances out the loose structure of the chiffon pants. When layering your tops, however, you should make sure that the layers are slim instead of bulky.


For example, you could wear a tank top and slip an open vest or sleeveless button-down shirt over it. As long as both pieces are cut close to the body, they won't add too much weight to the top of your overall ensemble.
To create something a little more professional in appearance, slip a cropped blazer over a simple tank top or form-fitting blouse.

, Chiffon pants are definitely a unique fashion trend, so they tend to demand attention no matter what you pair them with. A good way to keep your outfit looking sophisticated and well put together is to pair this temporary fashion fad with a simple top cut in a timeless style.


Consider wearing a simple black tank top with white chiffon pants for an effortlessly elegant look. If you want to try for something a little more sultry, choose a black, red, or metallic-tone tank top with a low, strappy back., White chiffon palazzo pants have a very breezy, easy-going appearance. Pairing them with a plain white top creates an overall look that screams “summer at the beach.”The top doesn't necessarily need to be solid white, either. If you want to create this look with a blouse that has more detail, though, you should gravitate toward those that blend white with other neutral colors like black, tan, gray, or brown. A white and navy blue top could work, too.

, Chiffon pants can look elegant or easy-going depending on what you wear them with. Dress the pants down by matching them with a plain form-fitting t-shirt.


You should still pay attention to the “high waist” rule even when you pair these pants with a t-shirt. Choose a cropped t-shirt or tuck a longer t-shirt in.
Plain colors are often best if you want to create a style that is both classic and casual.

, If you want to wear chiffon pants to the office or to a party, you can make them look more elegant by matching them with a nice blouse. Keep the style of the blouse fairly simple so that it does not clash or compete with the pants.


Nearly any blouse that follows the ""form-fitting"" and ""high-waist"" rule can work well with chiffon palazzo pants.
The right chambray or similar button-down shirt can make the chiffon pants appropriate to wear to the office during an ""business casual"" dress day., High heels elongate the leg no matter what you choose to wear them with. As such, they are the perfect footwear to slip on when you wear chiffon pants, which also elongate the leg.


The heel style should vary based on the tone of the overall outfit. Classic pumps are great for more formal styles while wedges and sandals work better for casual or beach-inspired looks.

, A statement necklace or statement earrings work best. Placing the extra amount of detail around your face encourages onlooking eyes to look both up and down your ensemble.

, If you choose to carry a handbag, you should choose something that matches both the tone and color of your outfit. Since a purse spends a lot of time around your leg area, sticking with a simple style is a good way to avoid choosing anything that clashes or competes for attention with your chiffon pants.

As a general rule, you should focus on either your eyes or your lips instead of applying heavy makeup to both. If you wear a bright red lipstick, keep your eye makeup more subdued. If you opt for a dramatic shadowy look for your eyes, opt for a lipstick color that's closer to your natural lip color.
The occasion and tone of the overall outfit can make a difference, too. Casual daytime looks tend to work best with light makeup, but you can apply more dramatic makeup when working with sophisticated evening styles.

It’s a good idea to pick out your outfit first before deciding which tie, pocket square and other accessories will go with it best.

, If you're decked out in multiple patterns, it's a good idea to make sure that they're different enough to keep from being jarring.

If you're going to coordinate it with another article of clothing, it should be your shirt., In general, you should go with a fold that you like and think looks good.

A square fold will look best with pocket squares in solid colors, or those with neat, subdued patterns like stripes or dots., Set out the pocket square in a diamond shape. Fold it neatly in half from the bottom so that the top and bottom points are aligned. With the resulting triangle, fold the left and right points inward to the center to make the square small enough to slip into your jacket.Double check that the folded points are perfectly centered—there should be no overlap whatsoever. Be careful not to be too rough with the square as you fit it into your pocket.

Fold the bottom point up at a slight angle so that it ends up in line about an inch beside the top point. Crease both side points over and smooth the square before placing it in your pocket. You should end up with two identical peaks side by side.This fold can be a bit tricky to get right. You may have to give it a couple test runs to achieve a neat, symmetrical outcome.
It will be easier to form natural-looking folds that hold their shape with a soft, flowing fabric like silk., Starting with the square in a diamond shape, fold the bottom point up and slightly over to one side so that it’s positioned just next to the top point. Then, take hold of the squared point on the side you just folded and bring it across to the opposite side of the top point. Tuck the remaining side point behind the other folds and carefully fit the square into your suit pocket.Folds with three or more points provide an air of suave sophistication that will turn heads at high-profile events.
Solid colors and simple patterns tend to work best for multi-point folds. If you’re not careful, a more complex pattern may clash with the intricate design of the fold."

Don't forget your sgian dubh!",How to Wear a Kilt," The top of the garment should be situated at the natural waist; the two aprons will overlap in the front. It should hang around your knee.


Take your right arm and wrap it around your front. The edge of the right should meet up with the left, where there is a small hole in the lining for a strap to go through.;
, Most kilts have a leather strap on the right apron, which is often called the under apron. Pull the strap through to the outside until it's comfortable. You should be just able to get your thumbs inside the waistband.


Fasten it to the buckle, just like a belt, at the outer edge of the left waist.
With your left hand on your right hip, fasten the leather strap on the left apron, or front apron, to the buckles on the right; usually, there will be two. Do the top strap first.

If your kilt features a third strap further down the right hip, fasten it to create a smooth fit across the stomach. Make sure it's not bunching toward the top or along the buckles.



, If you have buckled the kilt correctly, the fringed edge of the kilt should be along the right side and the kilt should be centered on the body. Most kilts feature a pivot point in the tartan in the center of the front apron. This is the place where the tartan pattern mirrors itself. This pivot point should be in the center of your body.


It should have a good A shape to it. Adjust as necessary, making sure that you're comfortable and everything is lying correctly.

, Generally, keep the flashes with the kilt they match. Pull the kilt hose, which resemble knee socks, over the knee before you deal with the other two pieces.


Fasten the garter and flashes just below the knee. The flashes should be off to the outside of the leg.
Fold the kilt hose to below the knee about 3-4 fingers down and over the garter, displaying a few inches of the flashes. Smooth it all out and adjust as necessary, making sure both sets of flashes are displayed at the same angle. eg: Left Hand at 11 am, Right Hand at 1 pm.

, Don't tie them halfway up your legs! There are two ways to tie them; choose the one that appeals most to you.

The Low Tie: Follow the steps described in the High-Front tie method, but scrunch everything down so that it remains around your ankle instead of up your calf. With this method, tie in a bow or a half hitch bow.

, A sporran is a leather or fur pouch that is traditionally worn at the front of a kilt. Fasten the sporran strap using the loops at the back of your kilt. The sporran should be centered and hang about 1 hands width below the bottom of the Waist Belt.


Otherwise, place the sporran at the back of your body and fasten the buckle in front of you. Swing it around so the sporran is now resting on your abdomen.

, They're available in a huge variety of styles and range from the classic to the contemporary. Pin your kilt pin through the front apron only. Pin it 4"" (10 cm) up from the bottom hem and 2"" (5 cm) in from the side.


In addition to being decorative, the kilt pin's weight helps keep the kilt from flapping, preserving your modesty when a breeze whooshes by.

, This part is fairly self-explanatory. The only thing to remember is that in the back of the vest there's a little strap that can be adjusted to your size. Use it; you'll look better if the vest fits you right.


For less formal occasions, the waistcoat is unnecessary. Use your judgment.

, That's your knife (a traditional part of Highlands attire) -- arguably the most exciting part. This little dagger goes in your right sock if you're right handed,left sock if left handed. If you have a kilt pin, it's a good idea to have it match.


Push it down into your sock, just enough to have about 1 inch of the handle showing.

Understand the different styles.,
Select the right design for the occasion.,
Pick the right fabric.",How to Dress in a Salwar Kameez from India," This could include panties, a bra, a camisole, and any other apparel you normally like wearing under your clothing. If your salwar kameez is transparent, you may want to wear a camisole or tank top underneath.


If you don’t have a tank top that matches or compliments the color of your kameez, a white one will do.;
, The salwar will generally have either a drawstring or elastic waist. If the pants have a drawstring, it goes to the front. You can also use pockets to determine front from back, as your hands should be able to slide into the pockets easily and naturally when the pants are on the right way.


Put the pants on as you would any other pants, with one leg through each pant hole.
Position the waistband at your waist (just above your belly button). Pull the drawstring tighter to keep the pants in place, then tie the string into a bow.
If the pants are tapered at the bottom, position them so your pant legs aren't twisted.

, The second part of the outfit is the shirt, and it’s always easier to put this on after you have the pants on. Depending on the style, you may have to pull the shirt over your head, you may slip it on and button it down the front, or the shirt may come together in the back with loops.


When pulling on the shirt, be sure that you don’t catch any beads, hooks, or special designs on your hair or other garments.

, Sandals and heels are the most common shoes worn with the salwar kameez, so your shoes may just slip on. However, if you're wearing sandals, be sure to tighten and attach straps properly so that they don’t slip off when your walking.

, There are actually many ways to wear the dupatta, or scarf, that’s often worn with the salwar kameez, and the way you wear it may depend on the occasion. For common, everyday wear:


Hold the dupatta in front of you horizontally. Gather the material into your hands so that it’s like a long, thin scarf instead of a large rectangle. From the front, drape the dupatta around your neck and shoulders, so that the ends hang down your back evenly.You can also put the dupatta on the opposite way (from back to front), so that the ends are hanging down in front of your chest.

, To wear the dupatta for a religious ceremony or ritual, hold the dupatta like a scarf and drape the material over your hair so the center of the dupatta is on your head and the ends are hanging in front of your chest. Cross one or both of the ends of the dupatta over the opposite shoulder., Hold the dupatta horizontally in front of you and drape it over your chest. Toss the ends over your shoulders so they hang down your back evenly. Adjust the material in front so it’s draping over your bust (but not necessarily your neck) and arms.When you wear the dupatta this way, it’s like wearing a shawl backwards.

, Hold two widthwise corners of the dupatta so it’s hanging vertically in front of you. Fold the dupatta in half to form a long, skinny rectangle. Then, fold it in half again in the same way. Lay the dupatta over your left shoulder and flatten out the material. Adjust the dupatta so it’s hanging evenly in the front and back.If you have sloping shoulders or are worried about the dupatta falling, you can pin it in place with a pin. Be sure to put the pin on the underside of the fabric so it doesn’t show.

, Depending on where you live, you may have to shop online for a salwar kameez. If you don’t live right in India but live in a metropolitan city with a large Indian population, you will likely be able to find a salwar kameez in an Indian dress shop. Otherwise, check online stores that specialize in Indian fashions.


There are many things to consider when purchasing a salwar kameez, including the style, color, design, fabric, and the occasion for which it’s being worn.

, There are many different styles of salwar kameez that are designed for different occasions and different fashion preferences. For instance:


When it comes to the tops, a kurta is a basic tunic that usually has slits in the sides, whereas an anarkali is a longer, flared, dress-like top with a full skirt.The kurta is more for everyday wear (but can be formal and dressy) while the anarkali is for fancier occasions.
With the pants, there are multiple styles, including churidars (similar to leggings), churidars with shirring (rows of gathers), salwar (loose-fitting pants with a straight cut), patiala (loose pants that balloon around the legs), and Capri-style pants that can come with or without strings., A salwar kameez can be a relatively plain and suitable for work, shopping, and everyday life, but it can also be decorated, ornate, and highly patterned, and a salwar kameez like this is much better suited for celebrations, parties, and special occasions. Where you intend to wear your salwar kameez can dictate what type of design you wear.


The plainer the salwar kameez, the more suited it is for everyday life. A salwar kameez can be made elaborate and suitable for special events with beadwork, embroidery, panelling, jewels, and intricate designs and patterns.
Color is also a factor to consider when choosing a salwar kameez, and the brighter and more colorful the outfit, the better it is for special occasions. Black, blue, and green, however, are better for everyday wear., The salwar kameez comes in many different fabrics, such as cotton, silk, satin, velvet, and chiffon. Just as certain colors and designs are more appropriate for different occasions, so too are some fabrics better suited to different purposes.A salwar kameez that’s for everyday wear will often be made of cotton or a cotton blend.
More expensive materials, such as silk and velvet, are often used for a salwar kameez that’s designed for special occasions, such as weddings, ceremonies, religious events, and festivals.

Keep in mind that you may need to cover your head or take off your shoes when visiting a temple.If you don’t want to wear long sleeves, a good way to transition your outfit is to put on a shawl or scarf. Wearing a shawl or scarf is a stylish way to be able to quickly change your outfit from casual to respectful.

, Even though it’s completely fine to wear swimwear at the beach, you should try not to wear revealing items like bikinis or speedos. If you are a woman, wear a standard one-piece bathing suit, and if you are a man, wear board shorts or trunks.


Bring a T-shirt along with you, as well as a skirt or sarong if you are a woman to wear when you aren’t swimming or sunbathing.
Goa is one city where you won't feel out of place wearing a bikini, as it is a big tourist destination known for its beaches and parties."

Keep your valuables in a secure place.,
Don’t wear expensive jewelry.,
Wear clothing that you feel comfortable in.",How to Dress in India3," If you are a foreigner traveling to India, it’s a good idea to keep any valuables like your wallet or passport in a money pouch close to your body or in a secure pocket.This may not be necessary if you are visiting a small town. However, large cities (not just in India, but in most countries) can hold thieves and opportunists who will try to steal from tourists.

, In addition to keeping your valuables close, it’s a good idea to avoid wearing diamonds, expensive watches, or other obviously expensive jewelry that could attract thieves. Instead, opt for your jewelry items that do not contain gems or precious metals.


Many women in India wear jewelry, so you shouldn’t be deterred from wearing jewelry if you usually do. Just use common sense to pick pieces that aren’t extremely valuable or dripping in rubies.

, If you are traveling to India as a tourist, it’s important to feel comfortable and good in the clothing that you are wearing. If you are not of Indian or South-Asian decent, you will be recognized as a tourist and may attract some stares. That’s why it’s important to wear clothing that makes you feel comfortable and good!"

Start with having the right clothing on.,
Wrap and tuck the starting end.,
Pleat the other end.,
Drape and secure the pleated end.,
Cover and tuck the hip.,
Pleat the remainder of the fabric.,
Tuck and pin the pleats.,
Pin it in place as necessary.",How to Dress in a Sari1," You'll want to have your shirt or top on (such as a choli), your petticoat (sometimes called an inskirt) on and tied snug, and your shoes on before you start wrapping.The top worn with a saree is typically known as blouse (choli).
While not necessarily required, safety pins make all sari wrapping much easier and better looking.;
, Hold the sari so that the shorter distance goes from your waist to the floor and the long end can be wrapped around. Then, start at one end and tuck the corner of the fabric into your petticoat at your left hip, wrap it around behind you, over your right hip, past your navel, and around again until it reaches your navel once more. Continue to tuck it into your petticoat as you go around like this.










Ensure sari is not too high. Ideally, your feet should not be visible from under the sari hem.
You can use a safety pin to pin it into place at your waist right now, but the petticoat should be secure enough to hold it in place.

, Switch to the other, more decorated end of the sari (called the pallu). You'll want to make the pleats that go over your shoulder. Do this by using your fingers span to space the pleats, and fold them across the short end of the sari.










You can use a flat hair clip to keep the pleats in place until you're done with your look. Just don't forget to remove it later!

, Reach the pleated section around behind you and drape the pleated end from the right hip and then over your left shoulder. Adjust it to the length you want and then pin it to the shoulder strap of your choli or top.









, Pulling the fabric from the top left of the skirt until it is taut at the back, drape it diagonally so that it covers your exposed love handle (or place where a love handle would be) and then tuck the fabric into the waistband at the navel.









, Adjust the fabric so that you have a loop in front of you of the fabric that is making up the waistline. Pleat this remaining fabric to reduce the size of the loop until it fits your waist. You do not need to pleat until it is very tight; a little loose fabric is desirable.









, Pin the front skirt pleats together at the top, adjust them to match the length of the front of the skirt, and then tuck them into the waistband.









, You can pin your sari in more places if you want to make it more secure. A pin at the armpit on the right can help make sure it stays draped over your right breast, for example.

Wear cropped pants that end between your calf and ankle.,
Wear cropped pants that fall above your ankle.,
Choose slim-fit if you have short legs.,
Go with high-waisted pants to make your legs look longer.,
Choose mid-rise cropped pants if you have a short torso.,
Use heels or a pointed-toe flat to draw attention to your ankle.",How to Wear Cropped Pants1," Most cropped pants are known as ankle pants, capris, or “clamdiggers.” These pants are designed to hit you below mid-calf, where your lower leg begins to narrow. This is the most attractive part of your lower leg, and you should use your cropped pants to draw attention to it.Cropped pants should not end at mid-calf, which is the thickest part of your lower leg. This is the least flattering part of your leg’s profile and not what you want to emphasize.;
, As a rule of thumb, even the longest cropped pants should fall no less than about 2 fingers above your ankle bone. This differentiates cropped pants from typical trousers. The shorter hemline not only allows you to show off your ankle, it’s also perfect for having fun with your shoes!, Petite women with shorter legs have a harder time picking the right cropped pants than tall women. Cropped pants can make short women look even shorter by causing their legs to look stubby. A slim-fit leg with either a tapered or straight fit will create a sleek look that avoids the stub effect.If you want to go with a wider leg and you’re a shorter person, try pairing these types of pants with a tucked-in top and heels., Even for taller women, the biggest drawback of cropped pants is their shortening effect. Choosing a pant that cinches above your waistline can combat this problem at the other side of your leg. These may be some of the most flattering options for women of all heights.Pair high-waisted pants with a tucked-in shirt to maximize the lengthening effect of these options.
Pay careful attention to the fit of high-waisted pants. They shouldn’t be uncomfortable to wear when you’re sitting or standing, and they shouldn’t pinch you when you button them up. You may need to take these pants to a tailor to get the perfect fit around your waist and groin area.

, If you have long legs and a short torso, you may be more worried about the top part of your silhouette. To balance the proportion of your legs and torso, pick mid-rise pants pants that sit right at your waistline. This will prevent your pants from looking like they’ve swallowed your upper body., Cropped pants let you show off your footwear with their above-the-ankle cut. Heels and pointed-toe flats are some of cropped pants’ best pairings. These shoes elongate shortened legs while also accentuating the wearer’s ankle.You can also have fun with other unique footwear. If you have a pair of cool sneakers you’re dying to show off, wearing cropped pants can be the perfect way to do so.

Try on your finished shorts.",How to Make Shorts out of Pants," See how the pants fit. Pay particular attention to how they feel in the different areas of the hips and legs. It may be that they're comfortable in the waist but too loose or snug in the thighs. Make a note of this: it will help you get the cut right later.;
, Are you going for a more casual knee length, or a super-short summer fit? Decide how long or short you want the shorts to be. Plan on cutting the shorts at least a half inch longer than your desired length to allow for a hem, unless you want to leave the edges unfinished.Take a look at your favorite pair of shorts for reference when choosing a length.
Cut the shorts a little longer than desired on your first attempt and try them on. The dimensions of the shorts will look different when worn and they may come out looking right and ready to hem. You can always cut them shorter if you need to, but you can't add material back once it's gone.

, Use a pencil or washable marker to mark where you intend to cut the pant legs. This will guide you while you cut for a cleaner finish, and any remaining marks will wash out later.Make a small dot where you want to cut the pant legs while you're wearing them, then mark them the rest of the way while the pants are lying flat so that the marks will be straight.

, Scissors are the obvious choice and allow more manual control, but a box cutter can provide a straighter, more precise cut, and tearing will create a more rugged, distressed look.


Exercise caution when using any cutting tool, particularly the box cutter; these have extremely sharp exposed edges that make cutting a breeze, but can pose a danger to the user if not wielded safely.

, Lay the pants flat and smooth out any wrinkles or folds. Use the scissors or box cutter to cut the pant leg. Follow the measuring marks you made carefully to ensure you get the right length.Once you've cut the first leg, place the removed portion over the second leg to make sure that they're both the same length.
Longer strokes with the scissors work best to keep the edges from becoming choppy.
If you're using the box cutter, make sure you have a suitable cutting surface underneath the pants. Otherwise, the blade can scar surfaces when it slices through the fabric.

, Alternatively, if you want your new shorts to have a rougher look, you can tear the pant legs by hand. Make a one- to two-inch incision with the scissors or box cutter to open a small hole and tear the leg the rest of the way. Place the pant leg across your lap and tear toward yourself slowly to keep the tear even; if you mess up, it can be difficult to salvage the tear.For a more even tear, you can make multiple smaller holes and ""connect the dots"" by tearing between them.
If you do happen to make a mistake while tearing, make a straight cut in the uneven part with the scissors and try again.
Torn shorts with unfinished hems tend to look better when using rougher materials like denim, as the thread is coarse and tends to fray in a more visually appealing way. The tearing method can also work with especially old or worn pants to go along with the rugged look.

, Try the shorts on. If they're too long, cut them again about half an inch at a time until they're the preferred length. Remove any loose threads, frayed edges or uneven nicks made by the scissors until the leg openings are clean and level.

, Decide what length you'd like the hem to be and mark the shorts again. Shorter hems will produce a neater, more uniform look, while a longer hem will create the appearance of folds., Fold the hem under twice (or over, if you want the folded look) and use a sewing machine to stitch the hem at the proper length. You can also sew the hem by hand, if you prefer. Take care not to stitch the leg opening shut by mistake.If you don't have access to a sewing machine and want a completed hem for you shorts, take them to any alteration shop to have them stitched for a small price.
Place a rounded object in the leg opening and stitch around it to avoid sewing the leg opening shut.

, You're finished! See how the new shorts look. If the hem is too long or too short, the stitching can be snipped and redone. Experiment with other lengths, hems and styles and add a fresh new dimension to your wardrobe.

Plus, tailoring an inexpensive outfit is much cheaper than springing for expensive brand names. Basically, you want to get the outfit nipped and tucked so it hugs your body instead of just hanging there.If you don't want to have all your clothes tailored, just spring for the items you wear the most, such as your jacket.
Many dry cleaners also do alterations.
You can also try doing some alterations yourself, such as hemming a pair of pants.;
, Simple plastic buttons can make your clothing look cheap. Buttons out of other materials, such as bone, metal, and mother-of-pearl, can make your clothes look more expensive. You can switch them out yourself by cutting off the old ones and sewing on new ones, or get an alteration place to do it fairly cheaply., Cheap-looking zippers can also bring down the look of an outfit. Zippers are little more difficult to change out than buttons, so you may want to have a tailor do it., Fabrics that are shiny scream synthetic and often come across as cheap. Look for fabrics like cotton, linen, or fake suede, as they can be inexpensive. They wear much better than other cheap fabrics such as rayon or acrylic.Polyester can look fine in some cases. Hold it up to the light to see if it looks shiny, and run your hands over it to see how it feels against your skin.

, Wearing all black or all white can help create a streamlined, high-quality effect. Therefore, if you invest in black and white pieces you can mix-and-match, your wardrobe will look more expensive overall. However, make sure you don't wear mismatched blacks (one more faded than the other), as that can look cheap.Neutrals, such as tan, brown, and gray, can also look more expensive., When it comes to ""extras"" on the cheap end of clothes, such as embellishments, it's best to skip them. They can start to look cheap very fast. On the other hand, simple clothes with clean lines automatically elevate your outfit.For example, instead of buying a fringed turquoise shirt with gold-like accents, opt for a sleek v-neck shirt with no embellishments that you can accessorize.

, Making sure clothing fits may seem obvious, but it can be hard to follow through in the dressing room. That is, you may fall in love with a piece, but if it's not in your size or doesn't fit quite right, you may still be tempted to buy it. Don't. Clothes that don't fit well always look cheaper., If you can't get a stain out of your shirt, such as grease or red wine, see if a dry cleaner can. If that fails, it's time to ditch the item. Stained clothes will never look expensive, so it's best to get rid of them when you can't wear them anymore., If a button pops off, sew it back on. If you see a loose thread, cut it off. It a hem starts to come undone, sew it back together (with thread in a matching color). All the little details are important, and if you don't fix them, they can cheapen your look., Scuffed-up shoes can drag an outfit down. Make sure your shoes look polished, and it will help create a more expensive look overall. If your shoes are beyond polishing, it may be time to toss them., Distressed clothes can be very expensive, but sometimes, distressed clothes on the cheap end of the spectrum tend to look just look worn instead of fashion-forward. The main exception to this rule is jeans that have just been ripped (not distressed), which can still look good at a cheaper price.Similarly, try to wash your clothes as little as possible to prevent them from looking worn. Try spot-cleaning when possible.

, Pills can make clothes look instantly worn out. Use a pill remover to take care of that problem. Similarly, lint and pet hair can also bring down a look, so use a lint roller on your clothes as needed., Anytime you've got an event (or even school or work), get out the clothes you want to wear the night before. If you notice any obvious wrinkles, it's time to pull out the iron. Wrinkles can make anything look cheaper, so just ironing your clothes can make them seem like better quality.A steamer can also do the job without you having to pull out an ironing board.

, Bumps from your underwear can affect the clean lines of a sleek outfit. Opt for underwear that doesn't show, and you may even consider donning a slip to help smooth out the edges if you're wearing a dress., Accessories can elevate any outfit, making it seem richer than it is. Gold accents, especially, can make an outfit look more expensive. Try adding some gold dangly earrings or even a gold clutch to your outfit to up its quality level.You can also add a pretty scarf to help elevate an outfit., You may not want to go out dressed head-to-toe in green, but matching your shirt to your hat, bag, or shoes, for instance, can help pull an outfit together. The effect is the whole thing looks more expensive., Hanging hemlines can give your outfit a messy quality. If you take the time to tuck your shirt or sweater in, it can make your whole look seem more polished and put-together."

Ignore trends.,
Only wear what looks good on you - if you're long-waisted with a soft tummy, don't wear low-waisted pants.,

Check out thrift stores.,
Buy the basic things.,
Be creative: altering and mending old clothes/clothes from the thrift store can be great fun.,
Don't go for the super-expensive jeans.,
Invest in good timeless pieces: splurging on your favorite jeans or boots can be an investment for years.

,
Don't worry about where you shop - the important thing is whether the item fits, is flattering and a good color.,
Shop for off-season clothing.,
Look for versatility.,
Make sure your new clothes are machine washable.,
Go to a discount chain for your trendy shoes - you can get cheap, fun stuff there, because you don't need it to last more than a season or two.,
Stick with the basics for makeup: mascara, lip gloss, blush, concealer, and maybe some liner and shadow.,
Use men's shaving cream.,
Have a black, a brown, and some summery shade (white is classic, but a pale gray or a subtle metallic can actually be more versatile) of purse - they don't need to match your shoes.

",How to Look Great on a Budget," They change almost by the hour so it will be costly. Instead, focus on defining your own individual style. Being unique is hotter than being a carbon copy of a fashion magazine.;
, Instead, go for a pencil skirt - classic, and thus always in fashion, plus (bonus!) you get the illusion of a perfectly proportioned figure. A mix of trendy pieces and classics always looks classier and more elegant than an entire wardrobe of fashion-magazine items.

, The options there are greater than that of most supermarkets, and cheaper than that of most specialty stores.

, If you must splurge, do so on conditioner. Never use any more shampoo or conditioner than a dime-sized amount unless you have long hair. And be sure to also cut off split ends.

, They can be a huge, mostly untapped resource. Go to ones in college towns where young people move often and may get rid of clothing only a year or two old. Also look for outlet stores. Again, even though the clothing is cheap, look for things that look great on you, not just things that ""fit ok.""

, Get some basic items like white t-shirts, skinny jeans, things that you can pair with other accessories and clothes to make them seem new and different every time you wear them. Don't buy a shirt if it only goes with one outfit.

, Check out the section here at wikiHow.

, Others will never see a difference between a $25 pair and a $125 pair. However, be aware that sometimes you do get what you pay for: at least some of the price of designer jeans reflects the quality of the cut, the stitching and the fabric.

,, Even low-priced bargain stores (even Walmart!) can accidentally make something good, so always have an eye out.

, Look for end of the season clearance sales. Also look for before and after Christmas sales but be aware that, even at a deep discount, some clothes may not be worth the price. Know ahead of time how much you intend to spend on something and try to stick with it.

, For example, look for a button down shirt that looks good open over a t-shirt or buttoned under a sweater. Extra points if it also looks good tucked into dress pants or a skirt for fancy occasions!

, Trips to the dry-cleaners can eat up money for gas and service, and no one likes doing their laundry by hand.

, But for basics you'll wear every season (basic pumps, black boots that you can wear and look good in the winter, simple strappy sandals), buy good-to-excellent models that are seriously comfortable, in real leather rather than fake, and buy the oils and polishes too so you can keep them in good condition. Try remnant department stores like TJ Maxx for good-quality shoes at discount prices.

, Especially if you have problems with acne or dry skin, a good-quality foundation for sensitive skin (applied with a very light hand on the sponge) is a worthy place to splurge, and really contributes to a polished look. Bad foundation makes the prettiest woman look trashy and tired, and good foundation lifts your whole look.


, It's much cheaper than women's lotion and gels. Shaving with shampoo or conditioner also does the trick.

This is usually the time when people begin to clean out their closets and shop for new winter gear. Try for late October or early November. You also want to pick a day and time most people will be available, like around noon on Saturday or Sunday.You aren’t restricted to one day, though. If some people can’t make it on the day you set, expand the swap to two to three days instead.;
, There is no set place for a clothing swap. You can have it in your home, a friend's, or even at a local community center or school. Wherever you choose, make sure the space has enough room for everyone participating, as well as their clothes. You should also make sure you have permission if you plan to hold the swap outside of your own home.

, Depending on the recipients of the winter clothing swap, you may want to set an age and size restriction. For example, if you are swapping clothes for children, try inviting friends, neighbors, and coworkers with kids of similar ages. Ideally, there should only be a three to four-year difference to keep the sizes close and give everyone more options. However, if you are exchanging clothes with other adults of varying sizes, be sure to invite a diverse group of people so everyone can find something they need.You may also want to restrict the number of people involved to between three to eight families or 20-25 people. This will help you keep everything organized.

, If you don’t set a limit on the clothing you may either end up with too much or too little for the swap. So set a number of pieces each person has to bring to participate. For example, at minimum you could ask for three to five articles of clothing. Then, you could set a maximum of five bags of clothing per person/family. It’s up to you!, The last thing you want at a clothing swap is dirty or torn items. Make sure that everyone looks over and washes the clothing they wish to donate. This means emptying pockets, inspecting for discoloration or tears, and running each article through the washing machine. If a piece of clothing has obvious tears or stains, you want to throw it away rather than add it to the clothing swap.

, When most people think of a winter clothing swap they think of jackets, snow pants, and snow suits. However, winter accessories are just as needed. Make sure to request gloves, mittens, hats, scarves, and boots as additional items. This will help ensure that everyone participating can find an item of use to them., The easiest way to get the word out is online. Create a group or event on Facebook and ask people to RSVP. You can also set up clear guidelines for the swap and allow people to communicate and ask questions through Facebook. However, you can also use platforms like Twitter or Instagram to advertise your event.

, Even if you already have an event listed online for your clothing swap, sending evites directly can help ensure people save-the-date and get involved. Use a site like Evite.com or simply go through email to send out invitations to anyone you’d like to participate. Ideally, you should send an invite at least a month before your planned swap. This will give everyone enough time to go through their clothing and choose what they want to bring.You can also ask anyone you invite to bring a friend if you don’t mind opening the event to more people.

, For a more local crowd, try advertising your clothing swap in the newspaper or a community newsletter. You can do this directly through your paper’s website. However, keep in mind that these ads do cost money. You are likely going to be charged by the letter or word count. There may also be a flat fee to run the ad for two to three days.

, If possible, have people deliver clothes to you ahead of time - usually a week or two before the swap. If you are running your exchange through a community center or school, set up a couple of cardboard boxes for people to place their items in. However, if you are having the clothing swap in your home, see if people can stop by earlier in the week to drop off their donations. This will give you time to set everything up.

, Separate items by type. For example, hang all coats and jackets up on clothing racks. Fold and lay out pants and shirts on tables. Pair mittens with scarves and hats and hang them when possible. You can even divide articles of clothing into different rooms if you don’t have space for everything in one area.


Separating the categories will help people find what they are looking for quickly and save everyone time.

, The purpose of a clothing swap is for everyone to find what they need. Let people choose whatever they want regardless of what they brought. For example, if one person brought only five pieces while another person brought two bags, they should still be able to take or swap the same amount. The same goes for pricing. Don't worry about how expensive an item is, at a swap everything is equivalent.


If you worry there won't be an even distribution of items, you could set a limit on how many items each person can take. However, try to make it clear to attendees ahead of time that the swap is a free-for-all so that there are no misunderstandings during the event.

, There are no set guidelines to operating a swap. However, to avoid potential conflict, be direct in your expectations of the swap. For example, be sure to let everyone know that it is a free clothing exchange and that everyone can take as much as they need or want. The entire swap should function on an honorary basis.


If you feel this may be an issue, feel free to set an actual list of rules involving an item limit and amount of time people can shop.

, After the swap has ended, collect all extra items and pack them up for a local shelter, church, or charity. You can take them in directly or place them in a donation bin for pick-up. Simply search online for what’s available in your area.


You should, of course, check with all participants to make sure this is okay beforehand.

, You know, the 2 euro shops aren't just full of junky toys for kids. If you go to the aisle marked 'Toiletries' and have a good look. When I did, I was shocked to find shampoo, body lotion, etc, for half the price of what they are in pharmacy's. You can kit yourself out with shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, shower gel, mouthwash and body spray for a tenner. Scary, right? :)

, You will have to go to the more well known shops to get rid of that hair on your body. If you want to shave, I recommend Venus Embrace. If you want to wax, try a product like Veet. Laser hair removal is also an option, but that is usually very expensive.

, Next, your smile needs to be great. Buy yourself a decent mouthwash. Listerine is the best out there. If you find it very strong, mix it with some water. You will also need toothpaste, Colgate is very good. And get a toothbrush that suits you.

, Buy some pretty nail polish, neon colours are unreal! You can also get manicure sets from 2 euro shops. The same goes for your toenails.

, Nobody likes it. Plucking is a popular option. DO NOT SHAVE FACIAL HAIR! It makes it grow back thicker and courser, and more noticeable.

, Clothes. For the broke people most teenagers are, go to Penny's. Penny's is a girl's best friend. They have EVERYTHING. Shoes, tops, jeans, bags, shorts etc... They also sometimes have makeup.

, Makeup. Get a foundation FOR YOUR SKIN TYPE, blusher, a cute lipgloss, eyeshadow, mascara, eyeliner and lipliner.

There's nothing better than a nice bath or wash in the morning to loosen up, but when you do this everyday, you'll be feeling like the old way was a hundred times worse than it really was.,
If paint mixes, why not nail varnish?,
What you really need to finish off your face is a nice face wash.


Wash your face using the method described in one of the above steps and place 2 cucumbers on your eyes.",How to Make an Outfit on a Budget1,"


Put your plug in the bath and fill with a perfect, warm not hot or cold, touch of clean water.
If you have some nice smelling oil, this is the perfect thing to add a nice smell to it - resulting in you smelling nice too.
Fetch a clean flannel and dip with water.
First clean your hands. Rub in a smooth circular motion with your eyes closed. While you do this, imagine that you are swimming in the sea, all the grime being washed away by the tide. As you do so, dip your hands deeper into the water, and swish them around. Then imagine you are climbing out onto soft sands...
Lay a towel on the floor and step out, imagining that the towel is soft sands.;
,


Pour both contents of nail varnish into a small pot, and gently stir the contents until it goes the colour you want it. But beware! As you have used two nail varnishes, the result is bound to be a little gloppy and thick so put a little water in too (accuracy?), to stop it making your nails 1 inch of your finger!

, This will not only feel refreshing, this will refresh you. If you don't like cucumbers, don't worry you don't have to eat them, but if you really want, just use one of those eye mask thingies instead.
As soon as you have done this, mash some grapes and use the insides as a face mask. Just scoop it up and spread over your face.
Keep this on for at least 10 minutes, then wash off using cold, cold water. (No, not hot, it HAS to be cold!) This is exactly what you need if you don't eat enough greens!

Cover your face, put your head down and get a close friend to pour the egg yolk (Having already separated it from the egg white) over your hair.
Get them to rub the egg into your hair in smooth round motions, as if with shampoo.
When this is done, you'll have to sit there for 15 minutes with your head down. But don't worry - once that 15 minutes are up you can rinse it off.
Make sure to do this part very thoroughly, or else you'll go around everywhere smelling like eggs! Yuck...

, Oh yes you do. You can use these old beads to give a spice to an outfit.


Find any old hair clip you like and a pretty bit of thread.
Tie the thread around the hair clip, (but so you can still open it) and thread beads on. They can go on looking random or you can arrange them in a special pattern, but either way these will look fab as soon as you put them in your hair.

, That's fine. Hairbands and Alice Bands can brighten up outfits as well you know... If you want to look smart up dressy at the same time, try this matching Choker and Alice band. Why not ask a close fiend to measure around your neck? You'll then have to add add 2 cm / 1 inch to the measurement you got. Stick pretty glue on gems to the a velvet ribbon, leaving about 3 cm blank at each end. Raid your mums old sewing box and pinch some Velcro. (Don't worry she won't know) Peel the back off one piece to one end of the ribbon and vice versa.

Shop in the clearance section.,
Go to clearance sales.The next simplest way to find cheap Hollister clothes is to wait for seasonal clearance sales.,
Try a flea market.,
Host a clothing exchange.,
Buy from second-hand shops.,
Browse through the racks at a discount store.,
Look for ads on free Internet classifieds.,
Visit online auction and discount sites.",How to Get Hollister Clothes Cheap," The simplest way to buy cheap Hollister clothes is to buy them when Hollister is selling them at their cheapest. The Hollister website has a year-round clearance section filled with clothing from old stock that the company's main warehouse is trying to empty out. Similarly, in the back of almost every Hollister showroom, you can find clearance racks filled with the store's excess clothing from last season.;
, During clearance sales, a large portion of the store's inventory is discounted rather than a small amount located in the back of the store. These sales are not ongoing, so you will likely need to wait until the end of a season before you can take advantage of them. Your local Hollister showroom will advertise the sale in advance, though, so you will have plenty of notice.

, There is no way of knowing for certain whether or not you will manage to find any Hollister clothes at a flea market, but the only way to find out is go and look. Gravitate toward booths with racks of clothing, especially if the clothes look like they are geared for a younger crowd.


On a similar note, you can check out garage sales for Hollister clothes, too. If the family has teens or young adults, your odds of finding Hollister clothing at their garage sale improves.
Another advantage of shopping at flea markets is that you may run across other name brand clothing for cheap prices, as well as Hollister clothes.

, At a clothing exchange or clothing swap, attendees bring old clothes that are in good condition that they are no longer interested in with the intention of trading them with others’ clothes. You can hold a clothing exchange with friends and classmates who share your style. Alternatively, if the thought of wearing clothes that once belonged to someone you go to school with is unappealing to you, you can also host clothing exchanges with cousins, distant relatives who are your age, or any teenage children your parents’ coworkers may have.

, There are a variety of second-hand shops. While the way that these stores get their merchandise varies, each type obtains used clothing in decent condition and resells those clothes at a significantly lower price. You may not be able to know if a particular store has Hollister clothes in it, but if you make it a habit of digging through the racks on a consistent basis, you are likely to find some eventually.


Check out thrift stores. Thrift stores are often run by non-profit organizations and have charitable intentions. The majority of their goods are donated to them. Since they do not have to pay for their merchandise, even name brand clothing is sold at exceptionally low costs.
Look at consignment stores. At a consignment shop, the store is out to make a profit. The stock is given to the store by the store’s customers, and part of the profit is shared with the supplier after the clothes have sold.
Check out resale shops. A resale shop is similar to a consignment shop in that its merchandise is given to the shop by its customers, and the customers who supply the merchandise receive compensation for it. At a resale shop, though, the clothing is bought outright. As a result, resale shops tend to be pickier about their merchandise and may have slightly higher quality or more fashionable stock.

, Discount stores specialize in selling name brand clothes and other brand items at low prices. They receive merchandise that name brand companies overstocked or over-produced, and some stores also receive brand merchandise with minor flaws that the brand is unwilling to sell at their own storeroom. You are not guaranteed to find Hollister clothes there, but your odds are even better than they might be at a second-hand store. Moreover, the stock of clothing is all fairly recent and, as a result, in style.

, These classifieds are free to look at and post on, and they are common places for people who are trying to sell clothes. You can usually search the listings by typing “Hollister” into a search box on the website, but even if not, you can comb through the clothing section of the website. Make sure that the listing has a photo posted so that you know what you are getting into. If you have to meet the seller in person to make the exchange, make sure you meet in a well-populated public area to stay safe.

, Online auction websites are similar to online classifieds, but unlike online classifieds, the sellers are not often local and will ship the clothes to you as a result. That is an added cost, but it also makes the whole exchange safer. Discount websites work like discount stores, receiving overstocked merchandise from Hollister and other clothing brands and selling them at discounts. You will have to pay for shipping, but the convenience of being able to shop from home and perform searches for “Hollister” using the search box feature may make the slight cost worth it.

Shop at used clothing stores.,
Wait for factory outlet sales.,
Visit rag trade districts.,
Shop online.,
Have a fashion swap party.",How to Find Designer Clothing on a Budget," There are several possibilities here:


Try designer clothing consignment stores. These stores carry designer fashions that the owner no longer wants to wear but would like to get a little bit of money for. The owner of the store takes some of the sales price and the seller gets the rest. You, the buyer, often get a real bargain. Many times the clothing in these stores has been barely worn. Be prepared for last season's fashion sometimes but if the clothing is designer, it should withstand radical fashion changes and will be well tailored, well fitting and of good quality fabric.
Shop at thrift stores in wealthy areas. You will have to rummage a fair amount, so be prepared for some hard work but amazing bargains can be uncovered.
Try market stalls. Some market sellers specialize in selling used designer wear. You can search in local phone directories or on the Internet.;
, For lower level designers, these stores are around in most major cities. For more high-end, expensive designer wear, the outlet stores are fewer except in fashion mecca cities, such as Montreal. If you are near them, you will score some amazing bargains that didn't get sold for one reason or another to the stores and designers that were meant to take them. These are usually advertised in newspapers and by way of flyers or wall posters.

, Again, this works only in cities that specialize in making the clothing but they will often have some streets lined with boutiques that are so competitive, their designer label prices are kept much lower than in other parts of the world.

, Try eBay and other online auction sites. Sellers do the walking, rummaging and stocking for you. All you need to do is sit there with your mouse hovering over the clothes that interest you. Ask questions if the photos are unclear or there isn't enough information supplied.

, Get your friends together and ask them to bring at least one piece each of designer gear they no longer want and start swapping. Don't forget to include jewelry, scarves and hats as part of the swap party.

Keep your nails simple and clean, hit the Dollar Store and buy simple staple nail polishes for very cheap prices.",How to Dress Classy on a Tight Budget," Choose breasts or legs. Never both. Nights out often call for a little sex appeal; there is, however, a line that falls between classy and trashy. A mini dress, skirt or micro shorts are perfectly acceptable to wear but if you wear them with a low-cut top, you will be sending out an image other than that of a classy one. This also applies in reverse: a low cut top can be perfectly acceptable, providing your legs and thighs are not clearly visible too! Think a mini length shift dress, or a low cut top with a knee length or just above the knee length pencil skirt.;
, Insulting, suggestive or improper slogans or pictures will never be considered classy, though some may be humorous. When it comes to dressing classy, steer clear of any suggestive or rude language.

, Regardless of whether it is day or night, showing a little skin is fine: no one expects you to be entirely covered. But think about how much skin you would show at the office, meeting your boyfriend's parents or going to church. By all means, go for that crop top but make certain everything else is covered! A rule that many classy women go by is, ""show only one thing, cover up the other entirely"". That means if you are going to rock an appropriate amount of cleavage, do not wear shorts. Instead wear pants or trousers that cover up your legs.

, Those spandex micro shorts are not going to make the cut.


Try high-quality synthetics. They can look similar to natural fibers, particularly shiny protein-based animal fibers such as silk, satin and wool, and the subtle differences aren't necessarily bad. But they tend to cost less to buy, last longer, and, most importantly, cost next to nothing to maintain. If you prefer the feel of natural fiber, try synthetics on the legs, which are less sensitive, and outer layers, which are not felt much. If you're not sure about the surface appearance, at least try them on the legs, which are not observed as closely. You can find high quality products in some thrift stores if you know what you are looking for.

, Too-tight clothing is not classy! Tailored looks are a key feature of classy dressing. Squeezing into a dress is not classy!

, There will always be days where a nice over sized hoodie and tracksuit are acceptable but make wearing them the exception and not the rule. Baggy clothes do not make you look smaller; instead they just make you look frumpy and sloppy.

, Even in a casual outfit, ensure nothing is dirty, stained or damaged. Tacky items will only take away from the over all appearance.


Colors and fine patterns hide the inevitable occasional minor damage.

,, Think of any of these as a pair of thin tights. If you couldn't wear that top with just a pair of tights under it then don't wear it with your leggings. End of story.

, Don't be overly fussy. Covering yourself in glitter and excessive orange make up will not look classy.

, The right accessories can give that outfit a boost, and make it look far more expensive than it is. A nice oversized pashmina style scarf with a pair of skinny jeans, a vest top, and sandals will look cute and classy.

,, Things like jeans and simple coats are best bought at good quality as they will last you years.


Quality need not be expensive. The world has known how to make most of these items for many, many years, with established measuring and layout techniques, powerful machines, and modestly-skilled labor. Just check that not too many corners are cut, and don't spend a great deal because even the best clothing can get inadvertently torn or stained and wear through.

,


Sticking to shops like H&M and Forever 21 where prices are reasonable and quality is important is highly advisable.

,, Once you have an understanding of classy dressing, shopping in cheaper shops will be very simple.Get simple clothing and timeless pieces that can be worn throughout and past your economic slump.

, Colors like light pink, red, clear, pearl, nude will never disappoint you no matter what color you are!

You might also want to create an ombre look, in which the dye follows a gradient.
Dip dye comes in many colors, and you can use more than one on the same pair of jeans. Red, white, and blue jeans are perfect for the 4th of July!

Put on rubber or latex gloves, and then make your bleach solution by combining two parts water and one part bleach in a plastic bucket. Stir the solution with a stick.







, Thread a ruler through the belt loops of your jeans. Plastic or wood is fine. This will weigh down the top of your jeans when the legs are soaking in the bleach solution, preventing the dye from spreading to other areas.







, Lower your jeans into the solution up to your desired dye height. Allow the ruler to rest on on the side of the bucket so that it acts as a weight to hold your jeans in place. Allow the jeans to soak in the bleach for about 30 minutes.








Bleach often runs, so you should allow for an inch of extra bleaching when soaking your jeans.
If you haven’t achieved your desired shade after thirty minutes, continue bleaching until you do.

, After you have achieved your desired shade, remove your jeans from the bleach. In another bucket, prepare a vinegar solution with 1 part water and 2 parts vinegar. Soak your jeans in the solution for 5-10 minutes.








This stops the bleaching process, so make sure you are happy with your shade before beginning this step.

, Lie your jeans flat and allow them to dry. Then, you can add any finishing touches.

Let the jeans soak for 3-4 minutes, or until you reach the color you want.When you dip a small portion of the jeans back into the dye, you are darkening the area, creating a natural looking fade.

, After you have finished dyeing your jeans, let them rest for a minute before washing them in a bucket of clean, lukewarm water with a hose. Make the water colder as you rinse. Continue until the water comes off clear.







, Wring out any excess water and lay your jeans flat to dry. This will take a few hours. Then, feel free to add finishing touches, like fraying or rips!Check your dye label for any special drying instructions.

Find your budget and stick to it.,
Head to outlets if you're looking for new clothes.,
Be open to buying from second-hand stores.,
Get free clothes from friends and family.,
Look for bargains online.,
Take your time.",How to Change Your Style on a Budget1," This is perhaps the most important part of the process. Before you begin, determine how much money you can reasonably spend on clothing. This can be anything from a few dollars to several hundred. It should be small enough that you have no problems buying the things you need (food, shelter, textbooks, etc.). Write this number down and stick to it as you are choosing clothing.


See our budgeting article for help if you're unsure how much money to set aside.;
, Since you're looking to save money, avoid expensive malls and boutiques. Head to the outlets, which tend to have clothing that's just as good for a cheaper price.


Note that some outlet stores have the word ""outlet"" in their name (e.g., Gap Outlet) while others don't (e.g. Nordstrom Rack).

, Don't get too attached to the idea that ""good"" clothes must be new. Often, unique, retro, and one-of-a-kind pieces are available for cheap at your local thrift shop. It can take a little ""hunting"" around to find clothes that work for you, but you'll save lots.


Second-hand stores include charitable organizations like Goodwill and the Salvation Army as well as non-charitable ""thrift"" stores.

, The cheapest clothes of all are the ones you pay nothing for. Try organizing a clothes swap with your friends and family members. This is a great way to find clothes you wouldn't have thought of buying normally.

, Online shopping makes it especially easy to find good deals on clothes. Today, most big-name clothing retailers allow you to research search results by price so you can find cheap options quick. You can even try sites like Ebay and Craigslist if you're comfortable wearing other peoples' clothes (which you are if you've been shopping at thrift stores).


Though you might be used to automatically saying ""no"" to online mailing lists, it can actually pay to sign up for lists at your favorite stores. This way, when a new sale or discount is offered, you'll know about it right away.

, Great bargains are rare. You may not see an exceptionally good deal every time you go shopping. This is fine. Be willing to occasionally go home empty-handed, knowing that you saved yourself from wasting money on something that wasn't right for you.

Be open to DIY projects.",How to Change Your Style on a Budget2," Knowing what you want to look like before you go shopping will keep you from making unnecessary purchases. Figure out your fashion goal. Are you bored of your tomboy style and want to go for something more feminine? Do you want to bring more color to your drab look? Questions like these can help you determine your goals.


If you're having trouble, write down the names of people (these can be famous people or people you know) whose style you really like. Describe each person's typical outfit and determine how you can match this look.
You can also look at fashion magazines in the library or while you are waiting to check out of the grocery store. Note which styles you feel best about.

, While it can be tempting to buy something like a gaudy studded leather jacket at the thrift store, since you can't wear it very often, you're not spending your money wisely. Instead, opt for simple clothes that look good in many situations. You can use ostentatious accessories to give your wardrobe a little pizzazz when the time is right.


To start, you'll want a few good-fitting pairs of jeans, some neutral-colored shirts, a few sweaters or sweatshirts, and perhaps a jacket. These pieces should be dignified and timeless so you can get a long life out of them.

, Making a few changes to an old piece of clothing can make it look brand new. For starters, try decorating your clothes with pins, ribbons, sequins, gems, and other things you may have lying around. Fabric markers (which are usually reasonably cheap) can also let you treat your clothing like a canvas for your artistic creativity.

, A good general rule is to spend twice as much on each piece of clothing, but buy half as many pieces as you used to. This way, you get higher-quality clothing without spending any extra money. You can even save money in the long run if you ordinarily wear lots of clothing out — higher-quality clothing usually lasts longer.


Having fewer clothes means you'll need to be a little more creative with your outfits. Investing in a few cheap accessories from a thrift store can keep things varied for a minimal cost.

, What's cheaper than buying your clothing used? Making it yourself. You don't have to be a master tailor to make your own clothes — numerous how-to guides available online can help you here.


Our article on making clothing is a great place to start for DIY projects. If you're looking for how to make a specific piece of clothing, try searching for it here or on your favorite search engine.
Consider learning how to sew. Not only is it a fun hobby, but also something that makes it much easier to make your own clothes. This can also be useful for altering bad-fitting outfits bought at thrift stores.

Repair clothes with minor imperfections.,
Make your own clothing.",How to Dress a Big Family for Less1," One advantage of a big family is that, odds are, some of the younger children can wear clothes that the older children have outgrown.


Make sure that the clothes you hand down from one child to the next are in good condition and do not have any stains or holes.
Start this process while your kids are still young. Teens and older kids are more likely to balk at the notion of wearing someone else’s clothes instead of getting their own, but if they grew up on the practice, they mind find it more bearable.;
, A friend with a son who is older than your eldest might be willing to give you a few clothes her child has outgrown. Similarly, a sister who shares your clothing size might be willing to give you a few garments she has decided to clear out of her closet.

, A clothing swap is an organized event where parents bring their children's gently used clothing and swap it with others for what they need. Search the Internet or newspapers for clothing swaps in your area, or consider organizing one on your own.

, If your kids are resistant to hand-me-downs, make it their own by decorating it to their tastes. Change the buttons out on a blouse, or decorate a pair of jeans with fabric paint or fun iron-on patches.

, A loose button, fallen hem, or ripped stitch can be repaired with novice sewing abilities. You may be able to cover larger tears and stains with decorative iron-on patches or fabric paint, but be reasonable. Make sure your kids are still at an age where decorative patches are considered “cool” instead of embarrassing.

, If you really feel confident in your sewing abilities, try making clothes for yourself and your family. Patterns and fabrics may come cheaper than clothes themselves. If your sewing abilities are not quite strong enough, try investing in a sewing class to strength your skills and open this option up to you.

Make a list of what each child has, as well as a list of what each child needs. Also follow this process for you and your spouse.

, Determine an overall budget and a budget per child. Kids who need more clothes should consume a larger part of your budget than kids who already have most of what they need.

, Make sure each child has one or two pairs of pajamas, several sets of nice clothing, and several sets of ""play"" clothes that can get a little dirty.

, Look for classic pieces like jeans, plain t-shirts, and standard dress clothes. Spend the majority of your family’s clothing budget on these basics.

, Neon orange polka dots might be in one season, but in a few years, the fad will likely be long gone. As a result, any clothing you bought will also be dated and embarrassing to wear, making it difficult to hand down.

, These options may be scarce during the colder months, but once the weather warms up, you can take advantage of them a little more easily. Check the newspaper for flea market ads or keep your eyes peeled for signs pointing to a garage sale as you do your daily drive.

, These stores often sell discounted clothing with minor vanity imperfections. As a result, they are especially good options for “hidden” garments like socks and underwear. Avoid these shops for tops and bottoms, however, since vanity imperfections are a little more obvious on these sorts of garments.

, Online auction websites, wholesale clothing retailers, and online shops often sell decent clothes at lower prices than what you might find in stores. Only buy from reputable sellers and watch your shipping costs. In some instances, high shipping costs can bring the price of clothing up to the cost of store-bought pieces, if not higher.

, In general, department stores tend to be a little costlier and might be more difficult to afford if you have a large family. Some department stores have less expensive clothing than others, though. Before you rule them all out, get a broad idea of how pricey each individual store tends to be.

, Stores that offer free credit cards can quickly get you into debt if you are not careful, but many stores offer email subscriptions, frequent buyer punch cards, or similar perks without forcing you to sign up for a store credit card. These subscriptions typically provide you with coupons and news about sales, and punch cards usually offer you a certain percentage off your purchase once you reach a set number of punches.

, This can be difficult if your kids are actively growing, but try to predict what your family may need and plan accordingly. Instead of waiting until the last minute to buy your daughter a new blouse, start looking for the item before she desperately needs it. Begin shopping for garments while the old ones are worn but still in “working condition.”

, Sometimes, predicting needs in advance and waiting for sales are not viable options. If you, your spouse, or your kids are in immediate need of a particular garment, do what you can to find that garment at the best bargain possible. If not bargains are available, grit your teeth and pay full price, knowing that you will have to adjust your budget to make up the difference later.

They normally carry clothes that are in season and offer a huge variety. These stores get new inventory all the time, so visit every couple of weeks to check out all of the new merchandise.


Some examples of these stores are Marshall's, T.J.Maxx, DSW, Sears, and Burlington Coat Factory. You can find these stores in almost every city, so go online to find the discount stores near you.
When a major designer produces more items than it can sell at department stores, off-price retailers, otherwise known as discount stores, buy the merchandise at discounted prices. Then, they pass these savings onto customers. This is how you're able to save money shopping at these stores.
Full-priced department stores have the option of returning merchandise to clothing manufacturers if it doesn’t sell, but discount stores’ purchases are final. Because of this, they must sell everything they have in stock. This makes sale prices astoundingly low.;
, Shopping at thrift stores is an awesome way to save money and find one-of-a-kind pieces. Thrifting isn't as glamorous as most shopping experiences – thrift stores can be dirty, dusty, and extremely cluttered. But if you're willing to dedicate some time to thoroughly look, you just might find some gems.


Thrift stores are cheaper than any other store or sale rack. You might find less clothing to buy, but the pieces you do find will be unique and affordable.
Thrifting will allow you to include some other fashion eras in your wardrobe. Good fashion is timeless, so adding some vintage pieces will enhance your closet., Outlet malls carry discounted clothing from past seasons, or clothing from current seasons that isn't selling well in retail stores. And, while already discounted, outlet stores have sales too. The sale price of an already discounted item is a great way to be stylish while saving money.


When you walk into an outlet mall store, there will be beautiful displays just like in a traditional retail store. Instead of shopping here, head to the clearance racks to get the best deals.
Outlet malls tend to become a whole day affair so make sure you allot yourself enough time to shop.
Some ""deals"" at outlets really aren’t that great. Don’t take the stores word for something; that shirt may only be $4 cheaper than retail, despite their advertising., Every time you enter a store, go directly to the sale rack. These will become one of your favorite places to shop. Visit your current favorite stores, as well as stores you may not normally go into. The more places you try, the better luck you will have. Most department stores usually have a few huge sales a year, and most other stores you can find in the mall have a sale rack or two in the back. You will learn to live there; it’s a quaint neighborhood really.


Be wary of the return policy for on-sale items; they’re usually different.
Don’t be ashamed to be cheap. Have no shame in walking straight past all the regular-priced items to the sale racks. Saving money is smart., The Internet is the best place to go if you’re in pursuit of a specific item. In addition to sale sections on regular websites, there are countless websites that specialize in discount clothes and overstocked items. You can discover your own lesser known websites simply through doing a little research.


Comparison shop. Use price-comparison sites such as bizrate.com, mysimon.com, and froogle.com to compare the prices of items that are available at various online stores.
Learning what size to order can be a trial and error process. Measuring yourself is a must in the beginning. Start out buying easier items like shirts and shoes before buying harder items like coats, and the ever unpredictable jeans or pants. Don't buy jeans or pants online unless you have tried them on before, but it’s all a judgment call.
Free shipping! Look for sites that offer free shipping. Sometimes shipping is free when you spend a certain amount of money, so pay attention to how much you're spending and be smart with your money.
Security. Make sure the website you're shopping on is secure before giving out any important information. Stick to well-known stores when buying items online. Check your credit card bills to make sure they include only your legitimate purchases., This is a great way to get rid of some of the clothing you no longer wear and replace it with new pieces that you love. You'll typically get a higher trade value than cash for your clothing.Popular resale stores include Buffalo Exchange, Crossroads, and Plato's Closet. They all have different policies and are looking for different types of clothing. Just because one store doesn't want your clothing doesn't mean all of the stores won't want it.

, If you have designer clothes or any other clothes or accessories (sunglasses, shoes, scarves, hats, etc.) that you think could yield a profit, resell them. This will clean out your closet and earn you money to buy new clothes. These stores are more expensive than thrift stores, but still much cheaper than retail. You'll typically get a higher trade value than cash for your clothing.There are online resale stores as well. With these stores, you'll be able to sell or trade your clothes with other users. Some of these include Poshmark, Twice, and Thredup.Selling your clothes on Ebay or Craigslist is also an option to consider. This is only recommended if your clothing is designer-made and in good quality.
If you have a lot of stuff to sell with along with your clothes, you could also consider a yard sale. Get a few friends together and see if they want to do a yard sale together.

, Charity is a great way to discard your old clothes (and can usually be used as a tax write-off). You'll be able to clean out your closet to make room for newer purchases. Some thrift stores offer exchanges for donations as well, so be sure to ask when you are donating your clothing., If you're skilled with a needle and thread – or even a pair of scissors – repurpose your old clothing. If you have pants that fit great in the waist but have become too short in the leg, cut them into shorts! There are even ways to turn old sweaters into purses.Look online for tutorials on how to repurpose your old clothing. You should be able to find creative ideas and step-by-step instructions. Pinterest is a good place to start.

, One of the best ways to get a wardrobe you love is to refresh your closet frequently. Get rid of items that you don’t wear regularly and replace them with new pieces. Host a clothing swap party with friends, and ask everyone to bring clothing and accessories they no longer want. You can get rid of your clothes and get new items for free at the same time., Shopping on a budget can be difficult – especially when you want everything. However, if you can't afford to splurge, it's important that you give yourself a budget. Be honest with yourself about your finances. Following a budget will allow you to get the essential items that your closet is missing – jeans, basic tops, boots, etc. Once you do this, you'll be able to figure out if you can afford those high heels you've been eyeing.


If you give yourself a budget, you'll be less likely to buy items that you really don't need.
When shopping online, use a price filter. If you cut yourself off from the expensive items, you'll be likely to spend less money., Doing your shopping during postseason sales is a great way to build your wardrobe on a budget. Take inventory of your closet and determine what you'll need for the upcoming year. Then, create a budget around those seasonal purchases. Buy investment pieces such as business suits in January, purchase winter coats and boots in late February, and load up on swimsuits and summer clothing in late August. Buying these clothes when they're on sale will help you save money, and you'll already have your shopping done for the following year., Even if you avoid splurging on expensive designer pieces, trend-chasing is still a costly habit. Because trends have such quick turnarounds, keeping up with them will break the bank, even if you’re purchasing lower-end clothing. When you stop trend-chasing and focus on fashion, you’ll be able to develop an eye for the basic pieces that you need and the select few trend pieces that make your wardrobe pop. Focusing on fashion will allow you the time to invest in pieces that will last through the years.


If you want a few trendy items that you’ll only wear a few times, hit the clearance racks and outlet malls. This way, you won't be spending the bulk of your clothing budget on items you’ll rarely wear., Dry clean-only items will end up costing you more to maintain in the long run. Instead, buy high quality but low-maintenance pieces to maximize your closet investment., This is a slow moving process in the beginning. Until you discover what stores you like the best, it may seem like time-wasting and frivolous pursuit. Yet, saving money on great clothes can be one of the most satisfying experiences. Buying clothes isn’t a vital aspect to life, but wearing clothes that fit and you love really makes a difference in your self-confidence and overall mood. You don’t always have to buy from the bargain rack (although you have a hard time pulling yourself away), but you can find some truly amazing clothes for even more amazing prices.

, When you pay with cash, as opposed to a credit card, you'll physically be able to see how much money you're spending. When you can actually see how much money you have to spend, you'll be more likely to be conservative with your spending. This will result in you purchasing the items you need as opposed to items you simply want.


Using a credit card is an easy way to overspend. When you can't see how much you are spending, money can become an idea as opposed to something real. This can be dangerous if you're trying to watch your budget., You can have expensive taste without spending the big bucks. To get outfit inspiration, window shop at your dream stores, or look through fashion magazines and blogs. Pick out the pieces that you love, and search for similar items when you're out shopping.


Many cheaper brands copy designer looks, so you should be able to find what you're looking for at discount stores or outlet malls. These stores often carry the more affordable sister brands of well-known designers.
Fashion magazines and blogs often offer more affordable substitutions for expensive outfits. When you look at these magazines or blogs online, many of the cheaper alternatives are just one click away. Start browsing to get some styling and shopping ideas., Classic pieces are those that never go out of style and always look amazing. These pieces usually include jackets, handbags, shoes, and suits / dresses. You should invest a bit more into these pieces, as they can be reused for years to come.


Get a coat or two (A leather jacket or trench coat are great stylish pieces).
A quality handbag will never go out of style. Pick a practical bag in a versatile color (blacks, nudes, browns) to carry on any occasion.
Get a few pairs of shoes that will go with everything. A good pair of flats, boots, and heels (or dress shoes for men). Spending a little more money on a nice pair of shoes will allow them to last for more than one season, and will go with most of the pieces in your closet.
Invest in a little black dress (LBD). The LBD is a wardrobe staple for a woman, and is a classic that should be in your closet. Find a little black dress that you love, and you'll be able to style it tons of different ways by switching up jewelry and shoes.
For men, investing in a nice, quality suit will pay off in the long run. You'll always have a well-fitting suit, and it will never go out of style., The great thing about basics – they go with everything. Keeping a few basic necessities in your closet will make it easy to stay stylish on a budget, as you'll always have a base for a good outfit.


Get a great fitting pair of jeans. A good pair of jeans will last you for years and can be paired with tons of different options.
Get a few solid black and solid white tops – short sleeved, turtleneck / long sleeved, and tank tops. These colors go with everything and can easily be dressed up or down. They can be paired with jeans, dress slacks, skirts, or shorts.
A go-to pair of black slacks or trousers will greatly enhance your wardrobe. Get a pair that fits you will, and you'll be able to create many outfits., Instead of buying entire new outfits, enhance your older clothing with new pieces, new jewelry, or new shoes. Pull out your favorite pair of jeans and give with a new life with a bright blouse (ideally purchased on sale). Or give your old sweater a fresh look with a new pencil skirt or pair of slacks. Buying select items will give your old pieces an entire new look."
"
Get larger pieces (pants, skirts, and jackets) in neutral colors that mix and match.,
Get accent pieces in coordinating colors.,
Look hard in your closet for anything you might turn into office material.,
Ask friends and family if they have office wear they're not using that they can give you, or at least lend you until your next paycheck.,
Make a list of what you need before you go shopping.,
Know that you are done shopping!",How to Buy an Office Wardrobe on a Budget," Neutral colors -- black, navy blue, gray, tan (or taupe or camel), cream, white -- work best, as they not only mix with each other, they don't stand out so you can wear them repeatedly and not make it obvious that you're wearing the same thing. (Navy blue isn't technically a ""neutral"" according to color theory, but it blends so well it's effectively one when it comes to fashion.) Remember that five well-chosen shirts combined with two pairs of pants will give you ten combinations, but two outfits that don't go with anything else will only give you two combinations. Here are some suggestions you can aim for:



Men: 3-4 jackets, 3-4 pair pants, 5 button-front shirts, 5 pair dress socks, 3-4 ties, 2 pair of shoes.

Women: 2-4 jackets, 3-4 skirts, 5 tops (button-front shirts or solid-color knit tops), 2 twin sets (matching tank and cardigan), 5 pairs dress socks and/or pantyhose, 2 pair of shoes (low heels, or flats if you can't wear heels at all).
Consider suits. People often assume suits will be more expensive than buying separates, but you often get a jacket and skirt for less money than if you bought them separately. Suits in solid colors or with subtle patterns are best for splitting up and using each half separately.
Shoes should be comfortable and well-fitting, preferably leather. Even if you buy your shoes in a thrift shop, look for pairs that appear to be hardly worn, as shoes do mold themselves to the wearer's feet and your foot is different! Don't try to squeeze into a pair that doesn't fit. Better sources for shoes would be the larger discount shoe stores or outlet malls. Also look for sales circulars from the department stores in your area -- often bargains can be had. If you know you consistently can find shoes in your size that are comfortable, online retailers or auction sites can be a good resource -- but make note of their return policies and the hassle involved if you need to do that.

Shoes for women: If you can only start with one pair of shoes to go with everything, choose black. For your second pair, choose a color that will go with more of your wardrobe. If you have a good deal of blacks, whites, greys, blues, pinks, and reds, navy shoes would be a good choice. If you tend to have more earth colors, such as beige, brown, tan, yellow, green, and orange, look for tan or dark brown shoes. Do not dismiss the importance of avoiding very high heels in the office -- remember, you will be wearing them for at least seven hours or more, and may have a job which entails getting up from your desk and walking to many locations in the office. Shoes with heels over 2 inches (5.1 cm) high will likely feel very uncomfortable at day's end. Neutral beige hose works best with all color shoes - avoid white, dark ""suntan,"" very shiny hose, and tights.

Shoes for men: As for men, black is the color to choose if you can only start with one pair of shoes. For your second pair, dark brown or oxblood (a dark burgundy or maroon) is recommended. Navy is usually not an option for men. Dress shoes for men should be simple, with 4 or 5 holes for laces and no design or contrasting trim that stands out. Dress loafers or dress boots can also work if very plain leather. Socks should be black or dark brown (small patterns are acceptable). Don't wear work boots, hiking shoes, or white athletic socks to the office.

;
, If you stick with neutrals for the big stuff, you'll have a wide range of coordinating colors to choose from for shirts and ties. Know which colors complement your skin tone. Avoid having too many neutrals, and stock up on solid colors, as distinct patterns are more likely to stand out (thus allowing people to notice that you're wearing the same thing again) and they're more difficult to mix and match. If you do prefer patterns, look for understated or muted colors, and smaller scale patterns that will not be bold and as memorable, but will coordinate with many of the other items in your closet (example: the black and white skirt shown in the introduction can work well with black, white, grays and many other colors).

, Maybe you have a nice white button-front that just needs ironing, or a pair of shoes that would look like new with a coat of polish.

, There are some charities in big cities that help lower-income folks dress for success. To find them, search online or if you're in college, ask your career counselor or maybe even someone in the business school.

, You probably have a limited amount of time to shop as well as a limited budget, so start with the lowest-price stores first, but focus only on what you're likely to find at that kind of store. If a particular kind of store listed below isn't in your area, skip it rather than taking a long trip (both gas and your time are expensive!) Stick to your shopping list, and be ruthless about quality and usability. If it's a beautiful jacket that doesn't go with anything else, it's not a bargain.



Thrift stores (e.g. Goodwill, The Salvation Army): Go to the ones in nicer neighborhoods, as rich people throw away better stuff. Look for jackets, pants, skirts, and button-fronts, as these are more likely to show up at the thrift store still in good shape. Be aware of what's repairable and what's not. (See Tip on repairs). Avoid buying used shoes.

Consignment shops: These usually have nicer stuff and more helpful staff than thrift stores. Look for the same sorts of things as you did in thrift stores. Call before you go there to find out if they have a good selection of office wear -- some shops specialize in it and others avoid it altogether.

Discount retailers (Walmart, K-Mart, Target) and Mid-level department stores (Sears, JC Penney): Buy your dress socks and/or pantyhose, possibly your shoes and tie here. Take a look at the shirts; look for machine-washable natural-fiber shirts and tops. The jackets/pants/skirts at the discounters may look nice but they are not usually made to last. The mid-level stores usually have big clearance racks where you can find good-quality stuff, but skip the overpriced stuff in the front of the store.

Off-price retailers (TJ Maxx, Filene's Basement, Marshall's): This is where you find the designer stuff that department stores couldn't sell. Luckily, last year's classic suit looks pretty much like this year's classic suit. This isn't cheap (expect to spend $150 to $250 for a suit) but if you've been unlucky at the consignment stores and clearance racks, it's still cheaper than paying full price at a department store.

Budget Online Marketplaces (Smashion.com, Fashion Circus): These online fashion sites have great fashionable items from people who are looking to recycle their closet. Let their outcasts be your treasures! These sites are better than consignment shops because you're being eco-friendly in shopping online AND you're helping out the sellers in that they don't have to split their profits with consignors.

, While you may have spent what seems like a lot of money, you will have picked up a wardrobe that will last, and that you can expand on easily by buying additional pieces when you have a little extra cash. Care for your clothes well, and they'll turn out to be a great investment in your career.

Look through your shirts and set aside anything that has a clothing brand on it or any graphic shirt. Skinheads typically wear simple tops or band shirts. It is okay to have some collared shirts. Your pants don’t need to be a specific style, color, or brand.


The underlying look for the skinhead is short hair and boots. Once you have these, the rest of your wardrobe doesn’t matter as much.;
, There are some ways for wearing clothes that is specific to the style of skinheads. For instance, skinheads usually cuff the ends of their pants. Another key look is the tucked in t-shirt or collared shirt. Skinheads also usually wear tight fitting t-shirts. Shrink your t-shirts instead of purchasing slim fitting shirts.


Since the style and movement arose out post-war Britain, the bomber jacket is an important addition. There are, however, plenty of skinheads who wear leather or denim jackets instead.There is not one set style for skinhead fashion. The important aspect of the style is the way you wear the clothes.

, Small pin buttons (1/2"" or 25mm) are cheap additions you can add to your jacket. You normally get these for a few cents/pence in record shops, book-fairs, or from online badge stores. You can also make your own pins and badges for cheap. Iron-on patches are handy, but make sure you don't burn your jacket with the iron as most are made of synthetics and will melt. Fabric glue can also be used as long as it dries clear and doesn't stain. If you can sew, use a needle and thread to firmly attach any patches.


If a group of your friends want to go in on a set of patches or pins, you can probably profit from them by selling them.

, Scout out clothing at cheap clothing stores, thrift stores, military surplus stores or online. Try to find clothes you don’t have like polo shirts, button-up shirts, a flight jacket, jeans, boots and other items associated with the skinhead style. Make sure the clothes are in good condition and fit properly. When buying from websites like eBay, be aware of fake goods sold as name brands.


Popular pants in the original skinhead community are Levis. Skinheads traditionally come from working class families, so they usually only have a few pairs.As a result, those jeans become worn in quickly, and this look became a part of the style.

, The staple of the skinhead fashion is Doc Martens boots. Buy generic military or work boots instead of Doc Martens, if you're on a budget. Check out car-boot sales, yard-sales, charity shops and second-hand clothes stores. Many of these stores sell previously owned boots in good condition. Undercover and Magnum are great boots, but are sold for a fraction of the cost on sites like eBay.


You can find second hand Doc Martens in various stores. Shop around for a deal.
If you budget your entire wardrobe, you might benefit from buying new Doc Martens. You will spend a little extra on new shoes, but they will last you for a long time.

, The bomber jacket originated from working class families of the U.K. The youth that became the original skinheads were inspired by their fathers who’d fought in the war. They would take this militaristic style and bring it to the street. Bomber jackets are simple and not meant to be too flashy. You should be able to find a bomber jacket from a department store for under $50.You can also check second hand clothing stores for bomber jackets.
The bomber jacket is the opposite style of the hippie movement that was occurring in the same era. Original skinheads tried not to look like hippies and didn’t care about what was happening in America., Thinner braces (suspenders) are hard to find in stores. Go online or buy two elastic waistbands from a fabric shop and sew them onto some clips. Buy black suspenders or another color that is relatively neutral.


Suspenders especially go well with a light colored shirt. Classic skinheads typically wore light shirts and dark pants.
The style could be comparable to the 1950s greaser look, but with shaven heads.

, You can shave your head for free. Most electric clippers only cut your hair so short, even with the guard-off. To achieve a zero-cropped scalp, without breaking the bank, nothing beats a shave with a disposable/interchangeable razor (the kind used to shave your face) and some value-brand foam or gel.


You might be able to shave your head yourself, but most skinheads have their friends do this for them., The only facial hair skinheads have is small mutton chops. For the most part, skinheads keep their face as clean as their heads, if not shorter. You can get a lot of use out of an electric razor. Even though electric razors cost more, they will last you longer than cheap, disposable razors.

, Skinheads support live music as much as they can. One of the best outcomes for budgeting your wardrobe is to spend the rest of your money on your local music community. Even if you don’t know any local skinhead groups, you can purchase reggae and ska music from your local record store.

, Racism was never part of the original skinhead ideology. All races were apart of the original group of 1960s English skinheads. They banned together because larger societal issues such as class. Skinheads were not racists, but instead were anti-racists. For some reason it became part of the definition of skinhead to be white supremacist, but don’t let that guide you and your actions."

It’ll be harder to find exactly what you want, but your patience will be rewarded in great savings.To figure out the size you should order, try on clothing by that designer in store. It can be tricky to shop online because of the different sizing used by each designer, so try on different brands to get an idea of which size to order.
Make sure you know each seller’s return policy before ordering with them. If you dislike something, you may not be able to return it.;
, This can require a bit of time and effort, but these shops can be a gold mine for discount designer clothing. Consignment shops take gently used clothing, often designer clothing, and resell it.

, This won’t work if you need certain types of clothing quickly, but it’s great for the patient shopper. Stores will discount items as the seasons change. For example, summer clothing will go on sale as summer ends in order to sell it and make room for fall and winter inventory. Scoop up these sale pieces, and just save them until the next year! You’ll have a closet full of brand new, discounted designer clothing when the season rolls around., Lifetime items are things that you truly believe you could wear for life, such as thick, beautifully built coats, sturdy leather boots, nice handbags, and suits- basically high quality, durable, and classic pieces.

Start your search my Googling the designer you like, followed by keywords like ""imitation"" or ""replica."" Make sure you read reviews of online shops before placing an order.

, It may be tempting to pop into cheap clothing stores and stock up on clothing, but cheap clothing generally doesn’t hold up. You’ll end up wasting money on poorly made pieces rather than saving up for more durable designer pieces.Plan out the pieces you most want and that make most sense for your lifestyle and current wardrobe, and stick to it. Don’t get caught up in the excitement of shopping and blow your money on items that seem great in the moment.


If you shop spur of the moment, you may be tempted to purchase the killer red leather mini skirt on sale. However, said skirt may not make sense with any of your clothes at home. Always shop with a plan.

, Set a goal to put aside a little bit of money every time you get paid, and watch it get bigger and bigger. It doesn’t have to be a large amount, but just enough so that you are actively working toward your goal. Once the money goes into the wardrobe budget, don’t take it out for anything else. Save it until you find something worth your hard-earned money.Decorate a jar or a pot to create a piggy bank. Put it somewhere that you see everyday, and start dropping your spare change and extra bills into it as you walk by. It may seem like a minor thing, but it’ll start adding up!

, That venti Starbucks latte tastes delicious and wakes you up every morning, but it creates a bigger dent in your bank account than you may realize. Cab rides, take out food, and salon manicures are all nice, but are they really essential? By cutting down on anything you can technically live without, you can set aside more money for designer clothing., If you want to set a goal to afford designer clothing, you should know which designers you actually like! By researching different brands, you can pinpoint the ones you absolutely love, and develop an “eyes on the prize” mentality. Find designers that embrace the style you enjoy, whether that be feminine florals or dark, sleek leather.Don't let trends influence your shopping principles. If magazines are promoting a hot trend that doesn’t fit your style, flatter your body, or fit your needs, think twice before buying it. If you spend large amounts of money on passing trends that you don’t love, you’ll be wasting your money. Be authentic!

, If you are a jeans and a t-shirt kind of girl, embrace it. If you prefer dresses and heels, embrace that! Instead of trying to completely replace your current wardrobe with all designer clothing, think about how you can incorporate designer pieces into your current look. Another important thing to take into consideration is your lifestyle. If you love five inch stilettos but work in a daycare, you may want to save your money for more practical items., Consider items with a specific function, such as coats to keep you warm and comfortable shoes for work. If you buy a piece of clothing that you know you’ll wear often or treasure for years, you’ll make sure you get your money’s worth. Calculate how much you’ll need to purchase your goal items, and start saving!


To motivate yourself to save money, cut out pictures of the designer clothing you long for. Glue it onto a piece of cardboard or poster board and place it somewhere in your home. Every time you see these pictures, you’ll remember your goal.

Check for signs that you need to adjust your corset.",How to Put on a Corset," When you bought your corset, it may have come laced up for you. If this is the case, don’t worry about lacing the corset unless the corset is laced incorrectly. It should look similar to how a shoe is laced (with X’s), but with the strings meeting in the center of the back instead of at either end.








If your corset came pre-laced, make sure the laces meet in the middle. The two laces should form an “X” with the center of the ex meeting on your spine.;
, If you have an even number of grommets (the hole where the lacing goes in), start by pulled the lacing up through the bottom of the top grommets. If you have an odd number of grommets, you lace from the bottom to the top








Lacing should be provided when you buy your corset. If it is not, avoid ribbon if you are planning on having your corset laced firmly. Lace should be used.

, Take the right string and pull it to the left side. If the first grommet has laces coming out through the top of the hole, then pull it down through the top of the hole on the other side. If the first grommet has the laces going down into the hole, then pull the laces up through the bottom of the hole on the other side. Repeat on the left side after the ride side is done.








Keep your laces even. Make sure you keep the ends of the laces even with each other as you pull the laces through the grommets.

, With the X complete, keep going down the line until you reach the center. You should end up with X's alternating between being ""on top"" of the corset and ""below"" the corset.







, With the top section done, repeat the same process with the second string but start in the middle. Continue until you reach the bottom of the corset.







, It’s great and definitely makes things easier if you have someone to help you put the corset on. However, it’s possible to put on a corset by yourself. Use a mirror if you’re putting on the corset alone.








It’s preferable to have a few mirrors around so you can see exactly what you’re doing.

, Everyday wear requires something underneath the corset itself. This is to absorb moisture and dirt from your skin, protecting your corset. If you do use a corset liner, get one made of cotton or other breathable material. Anything made of Lycra or spandex will just make you sweat more.








Most places that sell corsets will also sell liners. You can also make your own if you have basic sewing skills, since it’s just a tube.
It’s not necessary to wear an underlayer if you’re wearing a corset as lingerie.

, The side with the laces is the back. The side with the holes and knobs is the front of the corset. When you're getting ready to put it on, the busk (front) of the corset should be open, and the laces at the back should be closed.








If you have an underbust corset, telling which side is the top from bottom can be tricky. Usually the top of the back will be more straight across than bottom, but not always.

, Start by closing the front. You might need to make some adjustments. You should be able to close the busk in the front fairly easily, though some resistance is good. You should not need to seriously inhale in order to get it to close.








Some people like to have to pull harder in order to get the front closed. Others believe having the back more loose makes it easier to close the front. Experiment to find what works for you.

, The modesty panel is a rectangle of fabric which will most likely be attached on the left side of your corset in the back. When you put the corset on, make sure that the modesty panel is flat across your back and pointed towards the other side of the corset.








Slide the corset into place by starting with the corset skewed to the side opposite from the modesty panel and twisting the corset towards the modesty panel side.
As you tighten the laces, you’ll probably need to pull the modesty panel back into place a few times.

, The busk consists of the metal pieces on the front of the corset with the knobs and holes. You're now ready to fasten the busk by putting the knobs into the holes. This is trickier than it sounds. Here's how you do it:








Fasten either the second from the top or the middle clasp first. Simply put the knob through the hole.
Pinch the knob side of the busk. Now, with your thumb and pointer finger, pinch the hard part of the knob side of the busk.
Fasten the rest of the clasps.
Refasten any that come undone.

, Get the laces just tight enough that the corset will stay on without needing to be held up. You should only need to pull the sides together and give a gentle tug on the long ends of the lacing.







, Now that you've done most of the lacing, take another pass to get all the lacing as tight as you can. As you tighten, adjust the tightness of each X so that it keeps the two sides straight and parallel. With the X's tightened, make a final strong pull using all four strings at the center. This will draw in the waist.








Pinch the center of the X's and pull them away from your back, starting at the ends and moving toward the center. This is the easiest way to tighten the corset so that it fits to your body.
How tight you can make the corset will have to do with the quality and fit of your corset.

, Now that the corset is nice and tight, tie all four laces together into a bow or knot. They may be somewhat loose but that's okay. Just make sure to double knot it and you should be fine.








If you have a lot of extra lacing at the ends, you can get a smoother look by looping the laces around your stomach and then making a smaller bow or knot at the back.

, Now that you're laced in, take a look at yourself in the mirror. First of all, make sure that it’s somewhat comfortable. A corset should not bite into your sides, pinch you, or be anything other than noticeably firm. You need to be able to breathe. You'll also want to look at the back lacing and take notice of the shape of the gap.








A well-fit corset should have a gap at the back with sides that are perfectly parallel.
If the gap is wider at the bottom or top, you may need a custom fit corset. If there's any bowing in the middle you probably need a larger size corset.

, If you want to donate clothes, make sure they are clean and undamaged.

, You can dye clothes in a deeper shade of their original color if they are faded, or a darker color.

, Dyeing cotton-based clothes in the washer is easy and reviving the colors already can make all the difference.

, Take into account the color your garment was before dyeing it. For example, a yellow dress and blue dye might come out looking either blue or green, depending on how well the fabric takes on the new shade. Synthetic fibres don't take the dye at all, so ensure that if your garment is a cotton/polyester blend, it is at least 80% cotton before you try to dye it.

, You can also gather the fabric into loose (diagonal) folds and sew them into place at the side seam to make it more fitted. This works best with slightly stretchy fabrics.

, You can go anywhere from below the knees (that length looks good with a hot pair of heels) to really short shorts. Be daring!

, If you are self-conscious about your legs, wear it with a pair of leggings. Make sure the leggings end at the slimmest part of your leg for a flattering appearance. If you want, you can pair them with heels to make your legs appear longer.

They typically measure anywhere from 66 to 72 inches (168 to 183 cm) across,depending on your measurements. Using a fabric tape measure, measure your waist.To measure your waist, measure around the narrowest part of your abdomen between your rib cage and hips.


If the measurement is 33 inches (84 cm) or less, a 66-inch (168-cm) sarong will be plenty.
If your waist measures more than 33 inches (84 cm), consider making the sarong 72 inches across (183 cm).;
, The width of a sarong usually matches the length from hip to foot, so it generally ranges from 36 to 44 inches (91 to 112 cm). To determine the proper length for you, use your measuring tape to measure the length from your hip to your heel.You can use your leg length to determine the length of your sarong, or you can make it longer or shorter based on your preferences. For instance, if you want your sarong to be knee-length, make a note of the measurement from your hip to your knee.

, Sarongs are summertime accessories that are designed to be folded and tied, so they are usually made of thin, lightweight materials, and some of them are sun-protective. Popular fabrics for sarongs include:Cotton voile
Polished cotton
Satin
Nylon blends
Chiffon fabrics

, Use the waist and leg length measurements from the previous steps to determine the length and width of your sarong. However, be sure to add an inch to the measurements of your fabric for the seam allowance.


For instance, if you want your finished sarong to be 33 inches by 66 inches, cut your fabric to 34 inches by 67 inches.

, Starting at the top lengthwise edge of your sarong, turn down the edge of the fabric (toward the wrong side of the fabric) one-quarter inch (6 mm), and use a hot steam iron to press it in place. When you’ve done that for the entire edge, turn the hem down another quarter inch (6 mm) and press it in place again.Repeat these same steps on the bottom lengthwise edge of the sarong.

, Using a basic straight stitch on a sewing machine or by hand, sew a straight line just above the lower fold of the hem. Don’t forget to backstitch at the beginning and end. To backstitch, start at the edge of what you're sewing and sew forward half an inch (1.27 cm). Hit the reverse button or switch to stitch backward over that same line, and then go forward again and continue sewing.


Repeat on both lengthwise sides
Press each hem when you're finished.

, Repeat the same steps for the widthwise hems: press the edges down twice (a quarter-inch (6 mm) each time), and then sew a straight seam just beside the lower fold. Trim the excess thread and press the edges.

, There are many ways to wear a sarong, and they all involved wrapping and tying the sarong in different ways to achieve the desired effect. For a basic skirt:


Hold the sarong lengthwise (horizontally) behind you.
Wrap it around your waist from the back so it opens at the front.
Grab the top lengthwise corners and tie them together in the center of your body or off to one side. Tie the corners tightly enough that the sarong stays up when you walk.

, Hold the sarong lengthwise in front of you with one top corner in each hand. Tie the tips of the corners together behind your neck, leaving the sarong loose. Grab the bottom lengthwise corners and tie them together behind your neck in the same way.


In the front, position the material so it covers your chest and stomach.
Pull the excess material taught, and wrap it around to the back. Tie the material together in a few spots to secure it in place., Hold the sarong horizontally behind you. Wrap it around your body under your arms. Hold the widthwise corners in front of your chest. Twist each corner several times.


Pull the sarong tightly around yourself and wrap the two twisted corners around each other four or five times to close the sarong, but leave the individual corner ends free.
Draw the free corner ends up to your neck and tie them together behind your neck.As an alternative to this, wrap the sarong around your body and bring the ends together under one of your arms. Twist and wrap the ends like before, then wrap the ends around your shoulder and tie them together on top of your shoulder.

, This style works best with sarongs or scarves that are very wide. Orient the sarong widthwise so you're holding it vertically. Hold it behind your body by the two widthwise corners.


Wrap the sarong around your body, under your arms, and over your bust. Tie the corners together above your bust.
Bend down and pick up the other corners from behind you, and fold the sarong away from your body. Wrap the sarong around you, under your arms, so the opening is in the front.
Hold the ends together near your left shoulder. Slip your left arm through the gap, and tie the corners together over your left shoulder (you can also repeat these same steps on your right side). This will give you a loose, draping style.
To give the style more form, pull the fabric taught and tie a second knot in the fabric at your waistline., Hold the two widthwise corners of the sarong in front of you, so the sarong is oriented vertically. Tie the corners together behind your neck. Bend down and pick up the other corners. Fold the sarong in front of you. Wrap the corners around your waist or hips and tie them together behind your back.You can pull the material taught for a form-fitting style, or leave it loose for a more casual look.

, Hold the sarong vertically at your side. Wrap it around your body, under your arm. Wrap it over your chest and back, then tie the corners together over the opposite shoulder. You can either leave it loose as is, or tie the material together again at the waist or hips to give it more shape., Hold the sarong vertically behind you, wrap it around your bottom, and tie the corners together around your waist in the front. Bend down, grab the other corners, and pull the material through your legs to the front. Hold the excess material in front of you and adjust the length depending on whether you want shorts or pants.


If you want pants, leave the material long and loose. To make shorts, pull more material through your legs to shorten the sarong.
Wrap the corners around to the back and tie them together around your waist.If you're making shorts, fold the extra material before tying the corners behind your back.

To look even grungier, take a razor and scratch the cut the ends of the white threads.,
Distress the square edges from the white threads, where the slits get smaller.,
Wash and wear!",How to Make 90s Grunge Inspired Knee Ripped Jeans," The jeans should be 100% cotton, as other fabrics won't work the same. They should be baggy, straight, or boot-cut in order to make a true 90's look, but they can be any color.


Prepare your tools at the same time. These can be found below, under the Things You'll Need.;
, The most common shapes used to make slits are diamonds, circles, or rectangles. If you're not sure, start with a diamond shape, which tends to turn out well.

, Then use a ruler, and mark out two slits in the middle of the leg, going crossways across the knee area.


To look like true-90's style ripped knees, the slits should go across the knee, stopping 2 centimeter (0.79 in) from the seam on both sides; if you want the rip to be smaller, then mark it 4 centimeter (1.6 in) from the seam.

, These slits should be about 2 centimeter (0.8 in) shorter than the first.


Then again, make two more slits each a ruler-width each from the top and bottom, again making them about 2 centimeter (0.8 in) shorter than the previous ones. Repeat until your last slits are only 1 centimeter (0.39 in) or so long.

, Poke into the center of the markings of the slit, so the scissors will get into it with greater ease.

, Do the same on all the other slits.

, This will prevent any damage to the backs of the knees as you distress the jeans.

, Using your hands is possible too but takes much longer.


If the tweezers cannot pull white threads out after more than five to seven white threads on each side (2cm away from the slits), turn the jeans right side out and use a razor to distress the edges until you see white threads.






If you get two to four threads left after pulling without using a razor, if the slits are small as 1 centimeter (0.39 in), you can pull the blue threads using your hands.

, If you cannot get them out, pull the white threads to get the blue threads out, since the blue threads may be stuck inside the white threads. Then you can pull the blue threads out very easily on the top of those edges.

,,,, Cut very gently, to make it appear more worn.

, Use tweezers, and distress the blue ends from the white threads where it looks square, to lessen the square effect.

, If you have done everything correctly, then congratulations, you can wear your new ripped jeans outside! Wash then dry the jeans before wearing, to make those white threads to look fluffier.

Try shopping outside the box at thrift or consignment stores to find one-of-a-kind pieces. Thrift stores carry a lot of vintage items that may not be the biggest styles anymore but might be appealing to you.
Only spend good money items that will last you a while. Splurging when you find a great piece of unique clothing can be exciting, but only spend the cash if the item is going to last you a while. You’re creating a new, unique style, so make sure you’re spending your money on things - like a good dress, top, or coat - that will benefit you for a long time.Don't be afraid of colors and patterns! Bold colors and patterns will naturally draw the eye to you, but if you are trying to go in the opposite direction, don’t be afraid of wearing neutral colors and traditional patterns like stripes or plaid. Remember that you’re wearing whatever makes you feel unique.

, Forget about what you are “supposed” to wear and focus on what you want to wear.


Ignore traditional gender stereotypes. If you’re a girl who prefers men’s clothing, go for it. If you’re a boy who wants to rock a skirt, do it! Your unique look is all about being true to who you are and what you like.
Forget about whether you have a lot of money or a little money, and dress however you want. You don’t have to dress any particular way, no matter if you’re rich or poor. It is possible to find your unique look on any budget.
Throw traditional fashion rules out the window. Who says you can’t wear white after Labor Day? You can wear whatever clothes you want whenever you want to wear them!
Focus on your preferences. If an item of clothing speaks to you, then wear it. Don’t worry about what other people might say, or what looks you might get - sometimes that’s what wearing a unique look is all about. Wearing clothing that you like will make you feel comfortable and confident no matter what, and a sense of true confidence always helps you stand out from the crowd.

Get a new hairstyle.,
Play with color.,
Get creative with makeup.",How to Look Unique2," Find a style that accents your facial features and is fresh, creative, and easy to maintain.


The style doesn’t have to be totally off the wall to be different, it just needs to be a major change for you.
If you have long hair, think about cutting it short. If you have shorter hair, think about growing it out, styling it differently, or getting extensions.

, Whether you put streaks in, make a bold color choice, or return to your roots, find a color you like and go with it.


If you want a safe but major change, you can dye your dark hair blonde, or vice versa.
You can also dye your hair using a colorful ombre effect.
If your hair has been every color of the rainbow and you want a more natural look, let your hair grow out to its original color. This can take some time, but your natural hair color is always going to be unique to you.

, Makeup can enhance your beauty and also be a form of art and personal expression.


Try applying stars and swirls or other quirky designs around your face.
Apply unique eye makeup. Blend eyeshadow colors or do a sunset makeup look for a colorful look.
Try out a rainbow or glitter lip for more festive occasions. There are also temporary lip tattoos you can buy online for a one-of-a-kind look that can be easily removed.
It is okay if you choose not to wear makeup at all. Your unique style is all about what makes you feel good. And depending on your situation, the choice not to wear makeup can be a statement in itself.

Don’t be afraid to wear creative accessories.,
Choose a signature accessory.,
Smile.",How to Look Unique3," Sometimes unusual items will be perfect for your personal look.


For the crafty person, making your own jewelry is the perfect way to show off your unique taste.
Wearing Grandma’s old cardigan or brooch may not seem unique, but few people wear older accessories like these anymore. And bonus, older items are generally of great, lasting quality.

, Pick a type of item to wear with every outfit that will make people think of you.


Maybe you always wear a ring on your pinky, or a scarf around your handbag. Just choose an accessory that you like and run with it.
Try giving yourself a manicure to have totally unique nails. Blue nails with purple polka dots? Clear polish on top of natural nails? Why not?
Glasses are a great way to customize your style. Try some cute frames like a vintage cat-eye shape, or frameless lenses. You can also experiment with different types of sunglasses.

, A smile is your most natural, unique accessory.


Nobody else has your unique smile, and it is a totally free, attention-grabbing accessory!
Remember to have fun when choosing your unique style. A smile lifts your mood, and anything will look good on you if you are happy and confident.

The makeup.,
For the face, use a bright BB cream (CC creams and the new DD creams may also work) and/or foundation (liquid or powder form) to cover blemishes, dark spots, etc.,
Next is eyes, which is the most important part.,
Mouth should be small (not thin, but small) and somewhat pouting, but there isn't a need for makeup here.,
Now for the hair.,
There are really no particular guidelines for clothing.",How to Look Ulzzang," ~ The desired (but not absolutely necessary) key features among Ulzzangs are pale, flawless skin, big eyes, and a small, round face, somewhat reminiscent of anime characters. This, of course, is not how most Ulzzangs look naturally, because many use large amounts of makeup and sometimes Photoshop, but if you can achieve this look only using makeup and not Photoshop, thus getting a more natural look, that's great. (Ulzzangs in general doesn't look very natural but you can at least try!);
, and even out skin tone. You may need primer/specialized lotion/pore refining cream or concealer if you have spotty skin, large pores, or dark circles/eye bags. Apply setting powder to keep the makeup on. If you like, add a hint of pink/apricot shimmer (blush) to the cheeks for a little glow, but don't use much. Ulzzangs also like to have a small, kind of pointy nose, so if your nose isn't small or a ""button nose,"" you can contour it, but be careful to make it look as natural as possible.

, White eyeliner, black eyeliner, mascara/fake lashes and circle lenses (lenses that enlarge the iris, which makes the eyes look bigger and rounder) are used by most Ulzzangs. Also, since the style is from Korea, many people think that you have to have the Asian eye shape for this. It may make some people think you look more Ulzzang, but it is not absolutely crucial.

, Maybe some lipgloss if you like, but keep it looking simple, light, and bright.

, The hair is very different among Ulzzangs, and there is no specific hairstyle you must have. Just make sure it looks neat, clean and natural. Hair colour isn't crucial either. Popular styles include long hair (curled or straightened) with bangs (square or sideswept). Try to mix it up with hair ties and accessories, or even wigs if you desire a new colour or hair length. Check the latest Korean hair-trends.

, Keep it stylish and trendy, with some cute accessories, and try to add a personal touch to it.

Last minute touch ups.",How to Look Good at a Wedding,"  Wash your body and hair.  Condition the ends of your hair to make them silky smooth, if you're a girl.  Rinse everything out completely.  Brush your teeth for 2 minutes.  After you dry yourself with a towel, apply deodorant and body lotion.  Blow dry your hair until it's 80% dry and then let the rest air dry.  This should be really easy, if you're a boy.;
,  For girls, wear a dress.  The dress should not be too revealing.  Pick light, pretty colours but don't wear white, same goes for boys because it will draw attention away from the bride and groom.  Light blue, beige, peach, sunset orange, and lavender are good colours.  For boys, wear a tux/suit, depending on how formal the wedding is.  If it's a small, outdoor wedding, wear a tux.  If it's indoors and ""proper"", wear a suit.  Black and brown are good for suits.  Wear a white or light blue dress shirt under and a nice, skinny tie.  For a tux, wear a white dress shirt and a black tux.  Have a cool bow near your neck.  The dress shirt could be button down.

,  For boys, just comb your hair out and use some gel to make it spiky or sleek.  or girls, style your hair in a bun, curls, ponytail, braid, half up half down, or just add a nice hair accessory.  Ask a skilled family member or professional to style your hair so that it looks pretty. Remember to brush out your hair really well and then add a headband or something.  Remember not to wear huge bow headbands, maybe just a flower one with some sparkles.  Put some hairspray, mousse, or gel on it to make it stay good for the whole wedding.

,  Boys don't necessarily have to accessorize.  They can just wear fancy shoes. For girls, wear some precious jewelry.  This means no skull bracelet or silly bands.  Only wear real, expensive jewelry, because it's a special occasion.  Diamond, gold, jade, your birthstone, etc. Wear some pretty gold hoops or something.  Make sure to wear your most valued jewelry piece you own.  You could also wear gold bangles, a jade bracelet, or your birthstone ring.  Also carry a special purse for this occasion, if you have one.

,  Wear more makeup than you usually would on a regular day to school/work. Only put makeup on your kid if they're 6 or older, because no one likes makeup on a 2 year old.  For kids, just wear some glitter, eyeshadow, mascara, and lip gloss.  If you're a teenager, wear mascara, eyeliner, light blush, eyeshadow, and lipstick/lip gloss.  Adults can wear anything as long as it doesn't make you look like a clown.  Don't wear too much, but wear a decent amount.  Use colours like red on lips, light pink, blue, white, lavender, beige, peach, and orange.

,  For girls, wear high heels or fancy flats.  For flats, wear bow ones with glitter on them. Get them in white, silver, red, pink, nude, or brown.  Get heels that aren't too high, because you'll be walking a lot.  Get them sparkly or classic.  Just wear some normal heels or wear a pair that have bows on them, because this sparks it up a bit.  Nude, white, black, red, and brown are nice colours for heels that you wear to weddings. For boys, just wear some black formal shoes that go well with your suit/tuxedo.

,  Girls, check your makeup to make sure everything looks great.  Also check your hair and outfit, etc.  For boys, check your outfit and hair gel and shoes to make sure they're clean.  Spray on some light scented perfume such as flowers or citrus fruit for girls.

Give your hair Flair!,
Focus on Make-Up.,
Do up your nails!,
Accessories can dramatically change an outfit.,
Shoes --the right pair can make a difference in an ensemble.,
Make or alter your clothes.,
Have confidence and a positive attitude!",How to Look Fabulous (when You Have Nothing in Your Closet)," People will be impressed with a gorgeous hair style. Try different styles instead of a normal style that you do everyday. Go with barrel curls, or instead of that ponytail, let your hair just sway in the wind. Maybe some glitter or a fancy up-do?;
, A beautiful made up face will draw attention to you. For special occasions, you can go much more dramatic with make-up than usual...so take advantage of that.

, Make sure that you give yourself a manicure and pedicure! You can do this cheaply and by yourself very easily. If you decide not to wear lipstick or makeup, try a color that goes along with your skin color the best. A new color will have everyone saying that they love your nails instead of talking about what you're wearing. You can never go wrong with a French manicure.

,


A versatile accessory to use is a clutch. Clutches are multi-taskers; they can be used for special occasions, and they can also be used for a night out or a day at work/school.
Jewelry is another accessory that is a life-saver. A nice necklace and a dramatic pair of earrings can do the trick if put with the right outfit. Rings can add any twist to an outfit that you are wearing.
Scarves, belts, and headbands are also great accessories.
Focus on one or two great, dramatic pieces. Wearing too many at once will make you look over-done, tacky, and cluttered.

, How about cowboy boots with you blue jeans? Red flats with your otherwise boring T-shirt and leggings?

, If you have the expertise, or access to a handy and creative person, and some time, you may be able to make something unique and fabulous out of your same old stuff. Even simply using fabric glue with some sparkly embellishments, or ironing on funky patches on your ripped cargo pants, or tie-dying a boring tee shirt can enliven an outfit. Hey, fashion designers often start this way! Some other examples:


Put some rhinestones on a boring black shirt.
Add some dramatic trim to your jean skirt.
Take the length up on the hem and cut off the poofy sleeves your cousin's old prom dress.
Bleach out that concert tee for the dance. Make your own funky pants out of that length of denim.

, ""You're never fully dressed without a smile"" goes the song from the play and movie Annie. And it's true. Looking fabulous is, in large part, recognizing your own fabulous-ness. And, anyway, the nice part about having nothing great to wear is never over-dressing! Think simple, classy, and creative rather than pout, ""I have nothing to wear!""

Stay fit.,
Eat well.,
Treat your skin like it's your most prized body part.,
Maintain healthy hair.",How to Look Like a Celebrity1," Despite the stories we hear of celebrities who party to excess, we easily forget to give credit to celebrities' discipline. They stay active like athletes. Choose a steady workout plan that fits you well. Trends come and go, but consistency still remains key. Keeping up with a regular fitness routine will create great benefits for your physique and your skin., Quick meals on the go for a fast-paced lifestyle will only lead to health problems both physically and cosmetically. The saying ""you are what you eat"" reflects on your skin and waistline. In order to combat that, eat better, healthier food. If you follow celebrities, you'll hear of diets such as Ayurvedic, Alkalinization, paleo, etc. Research whichever plan appeals to you, figure out one that suits your lifestyle, and stick to it.

, The camera follows celebrities everywhere they go, and no matter the occasion, flawless skin is there number one accessory. While makeup might seem like the trick, constant care will help ensure a healthy glow. Even though breakouts and pimples are difficult to predict, using the right products can help prevent the most unwanted skin developments.


Use benzoyl peroxide based skin treatments for acne. Most celebrities use commonly prescribed skin treatments that we can obtain from a dermatologist.
Apply sunscreen daily. Too much sun leads to damaged, over-dried skin. Daily application of a good SPF keeps skin protected.
Shave correctly. Men reap the benefits of face shaving which includes exfoliation and moisturizing, so taking the time for a good shave is a must.Follow home remedies. It may seem surprising, but even celebrities apply dabs of toothpaste to cure pimples or place slices of cold potatoes on their eyes to reduce puffiness., Many celebrities wear shiny, styled locks of hair for every occasion, and all that work takes a toll on hair. Most of what they do to treat their hair can easily be obtained by visits to a trusted stylist and products that treat hair damage.Refresh dry ends with oils such as castor, argan, or jojoba.
Use hair masks to prevent damage from overt amounts of heat treatments.
Rinse out hair with cool water to help natural moisturizing agents that help your scalp."

Be bold with simple outfits and accessories.,
Use sunglasses.,
Buy designer quality clothes.,
Have clothing tailored for you.",How to Look Like a Celebrity2," Celebrities create style standards daily. When it comes to the everyday glimpses of them on TV or Instagram, celebrities have a way of making even the most basic outfits stand out. Trendy jeans and a t-shirt work like a charm, and adding the right hand bag or hat can make the outfit pop. For a more risky-yet-simple fashion statement, dress up in one color from head to toe. A lot of models, musicians, and actors pick a monochromatic look for several occasions. , You can find several pictures of celebrities candidly walking to a store or exiting a car. The one thing they will all have in common are sunglasses. Most celebrities wear a nice pair of shades when out, and most pairs and styles land on the big side. The elusive effect of hiding behind a nice pair of shades will give you that celebrity allure and mystique.

, From red-carpet affairs to interviews, celebrities dress phenomenally. Celebrities use top notch brands from designers across the globe. In order to start to emulate their styles, invest in some designer clothing. Moreover, stay up to date on your fashion. Celebrities dress for each season, so your summer clothes will be out of style come fall.

, Shirts, dresses, jeans, slacks, and all articles from a celebrity's wardrobe are hardly ever found on regular sales racks. Designers create specific clothing for specific celebrities; thus, celebrities' clothing fits them well. Seek out a good local tailor to visit. Get dresses to fit properly on your curves and suits to work with your frame. Tailored clothing makes you look slimmer, younger, and put together."

Find the best products and injections for skin care.,
Visit a cosmetic dentist.,
Put your hair in good hands.,
Perfect your body through surgery.",How to Look Like a Celebrity3," Taking care of skin reaches a new level when it comes to celebrities. Any and all blemishes must be removed at high costs. You could invest more money in dermatologist visits for cortisone injections to eradicate blemishes and unsightly pimples in less than forty-eight hours. Dermatologists can also do a celebrity favorite of radio frequency for smoothness. You can visit spas for full body facials to obtain a hydrating glow., A smile can be contagious, and most celebrities have an infectious way of winning us over with straight, pearly whites. Aside from personal dental care, trips to a dentist for teeth treatment can help ensure a celebrity smile. Filling in where teeth have been pulled helps create a better bone structure for a smile not to mention it smooths out skin to prevent sagging. Frequent whitening ensures that pearly tone that celebrities wear so well.

, Visiting the best stylists in the world means spending frequent hours and dollars on hair care; remember, a specific hairstyle in the 90's won Jennifer Aniston a place in our homes every Thursday. Thus, with so much riding on signature hair, the treatment that goes in to celebrities' hairstyles exceeds visits to everyday salons. Many top celebrities have been known to use hair extensions for special occasions to achieve an effortless rock-influenced look.For those whose hair is slowly going away, celebrities spend money on transplants that reverse the balding process., Celebrities achieve that fit tone by any means necessary. Often times they utilize the help of a surgeon. A lot of practices have come to light over the past few decades with lipo-suction being a very common procedure. Moreover, enhancing body parts through surgery is used to obtain an hour-glass figure. Implants for a better bust size have been done before, but more recently implants for a better backside have taken popularity, too. Also, men have utilized implants for their physique as well. Bigger biceps or legs can be achieved through surgical implants."

Choose the most iconic role.,
Buy pre-made costumes for a quick idea.,
Make the costume yourself.,
Accentuate the essence of the costume.,
Emulate the celebrity you pick.",How to Look Like a Celebrity4," The most awkward question someone can ask you during Halloween is ""who are you suppose to be?"" In order to avoid any doubt of who you are dressing up as, it's best to choose a role that stands out. Fortunately, when it comes to celebrities, you have plenty of options from classic to current.

, If money is not an option, visit costume shops. The benefits of visiting shops are plentiful. Most outfits are either purchasable or rent-able. Depending on your budget, you can invest in a good celebrity costume that can be used or lent out for several occasions.

, If you are on a strict budget, no worries. Most celebrity iconic roles look like common outfits from an everyday wardrobe. After you narrow down some options that you'd enjoy, find the essential accessories of the costume. For example, the right sunglasses and sleek black gloves stand out for Audrey Hepburn's Breakfast at Tiffany's role., Finding the final details to make a costume come together may depend on the essential feature of a celebrity. Lucille Ball, for instance, is known for her red hair, so investing in the right wig will bring that costume together. All the celebrities who are icons stand out some way. Find out how, and go towards it.

, Aside from the clothes and the look, celebrities have unique mannerisms. The way they walk and talk have helped their allure. When you are dressing up, imitating those qualities will be the final step to making the costume come together.


Work on the celebrities accent and speech.
Use specific catch-phrases.
Copy the way they walk.
Hold items such as drinks or cigarettes the way they do in movies.

Keep abreast of recent fashion trends to avoid looking square.,
Know that looking expensive takes priority over style if you have confidence.,
Invest in 1-2 expensive ""statement"" pieces.,
Get your clothes tailored to fit you.,
Resist the urge to buy knockoff products.",How to Look Expensive1," Having expensive taste is necessary to look expensive. Keep yourself updated with the latest fashion trends by referring to fashion magazines and following red carpet trends in Hollywood and New York. Remember that your own personal preferences, though important, need to share the stage with high fashion.


Model your behavior after rich people.
Conform to societal standards of wealth and beauty.
Listen to the advice of fashion magazines, blogs, and stylists.;
, Half the fun of looking expensive is wearing clothes that no one else would ever touch. Because rich people can afford to buy a lot of clothing and accessories, they have no problems trying something out one night to see how it looks, no matter how silly it looks. Have confidence that what you're wearing is ""the talk of the town"" and it will be, for better or worse.


If something costs a lot of money, it will make you look expensive.
Confidence is key -- you shouldn't care about what other people think about your style, because you don't either. Think about money, not necessarily about looking good.

, You don't have to have $1,000 shirts if you have one nice accessory or pairs of shoes. Forgot about looking extravagant and instead impress people with one well thought out piece of jewelry or a nice skirt. As long as the rest of your outfit looks okay, most people will focus on the ""show-piece.""


Aim for quality of clothes over quantity.
Reserve this piece for special occasions for maximum effect.
Buy cheap versions of the small things and save your money for bigger, nice pieces that you can build an outfit around., Cheap clothing can turn into a knockout dress if you're willing to fork over the cash needed to make it fit. Most clothing from ""middle-class,"" ""bourgeois"" or ""poor"" stores is made in sizes that fit the average person. But looking expensive is about going beyond average, so get your clothes custom fitted at a local tailor to make it less plebeian and more personal.


Remove ugly, pre-stitched buttons and replace them with equally ugly, but slightly more expensive, marbled or brass buttons., Knockoffs are imitations of famous or expensive things, and they call attention to you as being fake or cheap. Moreover, they frequently break much faster than the real thing and reveal themselves to be knockoffs quickly. Avoid buying imitation goods and just buy the real thing.

Keep your hair simple.",How to Look Country," Country style is all about the jean, but jeans aren’t your only option for bottoms.


For men, jeans are definitely the primary option for bottom-wear, but dark-colored jeans or corduroys can also be part of a country-inspired look, particularly if you’re trying to dress up your look.
When looking for pants, look for a close fit with legs just wide enough to accommodate some cowboy boots. No skinny jeans or baggy pants.;
, Certain cuts and prints unequivocally evoke country style--your job is just to choose one.


Long-sleeved button-down shirts are as much an integral part of the country look as blue jeans. If you want a country-inspired look for your shirt, look for plaid, embroidered, or checkered button-down shirts.
If you want to dress up your country look, go for button-down shirts with pearl snap buttons.

, Cowboy hats are easily the most classically identifiable feature of a country-inspired look.


For men, simple, solid colored felt or straw cowboy hats are the go-to. Some hats might include some subtle detailing, but generally you want to aim for simplicity.
To get the right fit, look for a hat that fits one to two finger-widths above the eyebrows and ears and sits securely, but not too snugly, around your head.
A nice, clean, crisp cowboy hat works for a dressed-up look as well.

, Of course the most country-inspired footwear for both men and women is the cowboy boot.


The boot style of choice for men is your standard roper boot with a flat heel and square or rounded toes (pointed toes are somewhat of a no-no in certain circles).If you’re going out, wear a dark-colored pair of clean, sharp-looking boots.

, Thick leather belts with chunky belt buckles are important center pieces of country-inspired style.


Black or brown leather belts with a chunky silver buckle are staples of country style. More elaborate belts may feature studs or tooled leather, but often the buckle is the true star.
Big, unmistakable belt buckles are one of the more fun aspects of country style, but use some restraint when going that route. If you’re going to wear a loud buckle, tone down the rest of the outfit to avoid looking overdone or costumey.
If you already have several distinctly country-style elements in your outfit (fringed vest or skirt, pearl-snap shirt, etc.), opt for a more toned-down belt and buckle. An understated three-piece silver buckle, for example, adds country appeal without overwhelming the outfit.

, When it comes to country style, silver is always the go-to.


The jewelry options for men are generally fewer than for women. When looking for jewelry, opt for chunky silver rings or perhaps a more subtle silver necklace.
As an alternative to jewelry, a bandana worn tied around the neck or folded into a shirt pocket can give a taste of country to an otherwise plain outfit.

, The right vest or jacket can add subtle country style to an outfit, so keep an eye out for flattering styles.


Look for a country-inspired sport or leather jacket to add a bit of edge to an everyday ensemble.
Wearing a nice classically cut vest can also be a good option if you’re dressing up a bit for a night out.

, Men’s hairstyles are about as simple as it gets: short and basic cuts are the way to go.


Because country style is about the hat more than the hair, a country-inspired hairstyle should be something that works easily with and doesn’t steal any thunder from a cowboy hat.

, Women have a few more options in this realm than men, including skirts and shorts.


Jeans are still the classic choice when it comes to a country aesthetic, though the jeans for women are often a bit flashier than their male counterparts. Studs and sparkles on the front and/or back pockets are popular with the younger and trendier country fashion set, and close-fitting, curve-hugging boot-cut jeans are preferred.Short-shorts, cut-off denim shorts, denim skirts (long and short), and floral, flowy skirts are all options as well. Bonus points if they come in American flag or hunting camo print.

, Women’s tops feature diverse colors, styles, and prints. Some prints, like rustic florals, plaids, or embroidery, are a particularly identifiable as country-inspired.


Long-sleeved button-downs are also the most classically country option, though rolling the sleeves of your long-sleeved shirt is a commonly acceptable element of the country look.

, Country style favors airy summer-style dresses that have a loose sway to them.


Choose a dress with a loose fit or with a bodice and flowing skirt. Both fit the classic country profile.
Look for dresses with light, floral prints, studded or fringed detail, lace, or leather belted accents.If you’ll be going out, look for a dress with particularly nice embroidery detail and/or beading.

, For women, the choice of cowboy boots is nearly endless and covers a range of styles, from tooled leather boots with a squared-off toe to floral embroidered boots with a pointed toe. Have fun mixing cowboy boots with dresses, skirts, and jeans to add a taste of country to otherwise standard outfits.


There’s some debate as to whether boots can be worn over rather than under jeans. The more style avant-garde have opted to experiment with wearing your boots over your pants, but if you want to play it a little safer, stick to wearing your pants over your boots.If you’d prefer to expand beyond boots, flip-flops and sandals with studs, charms, and sparkles are also options.
If you’re going out, you can pair a nice set of cowboy boots with a nicer dress for a more casual elegant look, or you can opt for a pair of boots with a higher heel, higher shaft, and/or finer detailing to dress up a look.

, A cowboy hat will instantly countrify any ensemble and can be a lot of fun to wear.


The cowboy hat options for women are largely the same as for men--felt or straw, solid colors--but there’s a bit more leeway in terms of adornment.
Women’s hats may include more elaborate studded details, turquoise accents, or rhinestones for added flash.
If you’re dressing up for a night out, it’s best to leave the hat behind. Unlike for men, cowboy hats will most likely dress down a woman’s outfit. Opt instead to wear your hair up or in loose waves.

, Bandanas are conventionally associated with the country look because cowboys and ranchers would wear them on trail rides to keep dust out of their noses and mouths, but modern country fashion now incorporates bandanas in a range of ways.


Wearing a bandana loosely tied around your neck or over your hair can add a touch of country whimsy.
You can also look for bandana-print shirts, skirts, and dresses that pay homage to cowboy style.

, Women’s belts come in two main styles: classic and modern. Classic belts are worn through your belt loops, while modern belts are meant to be seen and are worn over shirts, dresses, etc.


Adding a classic belt with a chunky buckle to a pair of jeans or shorts gives an instant country feel to most any outfit. Wearing a thick belt with a large buckle over a button-down shirt or loose sweater is a more modern way to embrace country style.
Big elaborate belt buckles are definitely a fun part of country style, but use some restraint if you go with a statement belt buckle. Tone down the rest of the outfit to avoid looking overdone or costumey. That is, if you already have several distinctly country-style elements in your outfit (fringed vest or skirt, a cowboy hat, etc.), opt for a belt with a more subtle buckle.
A classic three-piece silver buckle, for example, can add country appeal without overwhelming the outfit.

, When it comes to country-inspired jewelry, go chunky or go home.


Look for chunky silver jewelry, especially with turquoise accents and floral motifs.As with belt buckles, don’t go overboard with your jewelry choices. If you opt to wear a big statement piece of jewelry and keep the rest of your outfit somewhat subdued to avoid looking overdone.

, Depending on the vest or jacket, it can add anything from a subtle hint of country inspiration to unmistakable country flair to an outfit.


For women, loose, fringed vests can add major vintage country-chic to an outfit,while denim jackets can bring casual country flair to a dress or skirt.

, For the most part, country-style hair is simple--the old-school mountain of teased hair has long since been eclipsed by more stripped-down modern styles.


Feminine styles are the way to go. Long, loose waves work well alone or under a cowboy hat for a soft, romantic look, while side braids and low ponytails work similarly well under hats.

Know that expensive people rarely think about money.,
Be generous with your tips.,
Show off your excess without hesitation.,
Exude confidence.,
Be clean and hygienic.,
Let people know when they've slighted you.,
Remember that looking expensive means nothing if you are poor on the inside.",How to Look Expensive2," When you have a ton of cash, spending it means nothing. Rich, expensive people spend money like the rest of us breathe air -- all day, every day. So go out and be a baller at the next party, rack up some credit card debt, and be confident that you'll find a way to pay for it. Thinking about money and financial responsibility is antithetical to looking expensive.Unfortunately, looking expensive usually requires actually being wealthy. You can only convince people you have money for so long if you don't have any money.

, Everyone loves the benevolent rich person, so spread some of your love with those less fortunate when you can. Remember, however, that this is for show -- you are giving away money because you can, not because feel obligated to.


Create the biggest contrast you can between you and your server. While a $200 tip is a lot for a hardworking, kind waiter, it should feel like pennies to you.

, Getting the most expensive meal or picking up the groups tab shows that, to you, money isn't very important. Even more importantly, it develops something of an entourage around you, as new ""friends"" will flock to you hoping to get in on the action.

, Walk like you know everything, talk like you know everything. Rich people (those who manage to maintain their wealth for a longer time) are avid learners and listeners. They tend to listen more and talk less, but when required, they are the only ones talking and nobody interrupts. Try to be the same and talk sense. This leaves an impression that one has leadership qualities and good communication skills, both of which are prevalent in rich people.


If someone interrupts you, let them speak, but use your eyes to let them know their mistake.

, Dirt is the province of those less fortunate, so make sure you distinguish yourself as someone who can afford a shower. Keep yourself clean, brush your teeth frequently, and always wear deodorant.

, When you're an expensive person you have expensive tastes, and people don't pay for failure. If you soup is cold, demand a new dish. Make sure your car is spotless after going through the car wash, and let a store assistant know that you can handle it yourself, thank you. This slight air of superiority equates with someone who needs a lot of maintenance, which is a synonym for expensive.


Act like you deserve the treatment you've paid for -- because you do, you are expensive.

, At the end of the day, there are very few times that judging someone based on the price-tag of their clothes is helpful, productive, or kind. Pretending to be rich is, in many ways, the ultimate exercise in vanity -- you are lying to impress people who have no real interest in being your friend. Your time is better spent developing your own style, working on becoming a better person, or trying to earn money instead of looking like you have it.

Go window shopping.,
Change your shopping habits.,
Explore online shopping.",How to Keep up With Fashion Trends2," One way to stay informed about fashion trends is by paying attention to what merchandise stores are selling. Watch what the mannequins are wearing.


Retailers translate more inaccessible styles from high-end designers into wearable every day clothes. Being informed about what stores are selling can give you a sense of what’s “in.”

, It may be helpful to shop more frequently and buy fewer things at once. This will allow you to be aware of trends and make sure you are only buying things you love. .


Don’t feel pressure to buy something every time you go shopping. Make an informed purchase by taking time to look around and by doing research online.
Force yourself to explore new stores. You may not think a certain brand is your style, but it will help broaden your fashion education!
When you find an item you like, think about of two other items in your wardrobe that you can pair it with. That way, you will have a wardrobe full of clothes that you actually wear.

, You can explore fashion trends without braving a busy mall. Online retailers allow you to explore new merchandise quickly and easily.


Sign up for emails from your favorite stores. Many brands send out email blasts when they have new inventory and styles.

Downsize your closet.,
Keep the basics.,
Create a new organizing system.",How to Keep up With Fashion Trends3," Having a smaller closet means more room for seasonal and trending items.


Throw away old styles. Make space for new items by throwing away the clothes you don’t wear.
Be honest. If you haven’t worn something in a year, you could probably get rid of it.Throw away items that do not fit you anymore. We all have sentimental pieces of clothing. However, clothing clutter will only keep you from expanding your style.

, Keep a small collection of your favorite basic items, such as well-fitting jeans and t-shirts. These items are timeless. You can pair them with trendier items you buy.


Small items, like jackets and shoes are a good way to spruce up your basics.

, Make sure you are keeping track of everything you own. This will force you to be honest about what you are actually wearing. It will also help as you continue to refresh your wardrobe.

"
"
Embrace accessories.,
Save on basics.,
Explore thrift stores.,
Set limits.",How to Keep up With Fashion Trends4," Using accessories to spruce up a well-fitting base wardrobe is a great way to stay both on trend and on budget.

, Trendier items can be more expensive. Make sure you are budgeting accordingly. Look for bargains on t-shirts and jeans so that you can splurge on the occasional trendy dress or pair of shoes.

, Trends tend to reemerge over time. Consignment shops and thrift stores are great places to find extremely affordable clothing in older styles. This is a way to enliven your wardrobe when an older style comes back into fashion.

, While it is easy to get wrapped up in keeping up with fashion trends, set a monthly monetary limit so you do not spend more than you are able to on clothes.


Remember that fashion trends change so quickly that it is impossible to keep up completely. Buying a few items a month will keep your wardrobe lively without exhausting your wallet.

Wash your face.,
Moisturize your skin.,
Prep your hair.,
Wake up early enough.,
Eat breakfast.,
Take care of your skin.,
Get rid of puffy eyes and dark circles.,
Try to exercise.",How to Look Good in the Morning," Before you go to bed, decide what you will wear tomorrow. This will keep you from digging through your closet, trying on a bunch of clothes, and making a mess. Once you make a choice, lay out the shoes, accessories, and anything else you plan to wear.


Check the weather and your schedule to make sure your outfit is appropriate. Do you have an important meeting the next day? Is it going to be hot and humid or rainy?;
, Sleep is important for your mental and physical health. Try to get between 7 and 9 hours of sleep each night. While you are sleeping, blood flow to your skin increases. Adequate sleep will keep your eyes from being puffy and keep you from waking up with dull skin.It's important for you to develop a regular sleeping schedule. Over time, not getting enough sleep causes your skin to age and makes you more prone to wrinkles.Sleep on a silk or satin pillowcase. These materials are less drying for your skin and will keep you from waking up with creases on your face.Some people may need more than 9 hours of sleep of night or less than 7 hours of sleep a night. Adjust the time based on your needs and how you feel when you wake up in the morning.
Avoid alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine because they can keep you awake or disrupt your natural sleep cycle.Try not to nap too close to your bedtime or you will have difficulty falling and staying asleep.

, Your skin is comprised primarily of water and needs to be hydrated from both the inside and outside. If you do not drink enough water, your skin can become dry and flaky. Aim for 8 glasses of water a day to keep your skin hydrated and looking healthy.Moisturize your skin after a bath, shower, and when you wash your hands.Your skin absorbs moisture best when it is damp.

, Always wash your face before you go to bed.During the day, your skin is exposed to pollution, dirt, sweat, and bacteria.Washing your face at night will remove all of the day's gunk from your face. Going to bed with a dirty face can cause an acne breakoutand leave you with dull looking skin in the morning.


Everyone should wash their face at night, but this is particularly important if you wear makeup. Sleeping in makeup can clog your pores and lead to breakouts.

, Nighttime is a great time to moisturize your skin. Although you are sleeping, your body is still working to repair your tissues. The increased blood flow you experience when you sleep helps your skin better absorb the moisture that you apply to your skin.This is the time to use heavier, thicker moisturizers.
Moisturizers are best when applied to clean, slightly damp skin. Try to do this after you bathe and wash your face for the night.

, Sleeping in a bun is good way to have good hair day when you wake up. If you have longer hair, put your hair in a ponytail and wrap it into a twist. When you wake up in the morning, you will have soft waves in your hair. If your hair is not long enough for one ponytail, try doing little mini-buns all over your head for the same effect.


Tie the ponytails loosely to prevent creases in your hair.If you shower at night, you can braid your wet hair to add some texture.
You can also wash your hair at night and apply dry shampoo in the morning if you have oily hair.
If you are prone to frizzy hair, wrap your hair with a silk scarf or sleep on a silk pillowcase.

, Set your alarm and give yourself enough time to go through your morning routine. If you are not sure how long it will take you to get ready, time yourself one weekend morning. Once you know how long it will take you, you can set your alarm for a good time during the week.


If you go to bed at a decent time, it will be easier for you to wake up at the time you need to.

, Eating a healthy breakfast can get your day off to a good start and fuel your body. Your breakfast should be a combination of whole grains, lean protein, low-fat dairy, and fruits and vegetables.Part of looking good is having plenty of energy and getting the necessary vitamins and minerals your body needs.


Good breakfast options include: oatmeal with almonds or dried fruit, fruit and vegetable smoothie, multi-grain pancakes with fruit and yogurt, whole-grain waffle/bread with peanut butter, or an egg omelet with vegetables.Drink plenty of water as part of your breakfast.
If you are rushed for time in the morning, prep your breakfast ingredients the night before.

, Healthy, clean skin will have a nice glow and help you look refreshed. Wash your face with a gentle cleanser and moisturize your face in the morning.You should also apply sunscreen before you leave for the day. Use sunscreen that is at least SPF 30.Use a lighter moisturizer than you used at night.
You can also try a tinted moisturizer to give your skin a nice glow and a more even tone.

, Apply a cold compress to your eyes to get rid of dark circles and puffiness. A cold spoon or a bag of frozen peas can be used as a compress.To further reduce puffiness, sleep with your head elevated to prevent fluid from pooling under your eyes.Place the spoon in the refrigerator instead of the freezer so it will not be too cold. You can put the spoon in the fridge the night before.
Wrap the frozen peas in a cloth before applying to your face.
If the cold compress doesn't work, apply a concealer with yellow undertones to hide dark circles under your eyes.Used tea bags can also be used to reduce puffiness. Steep your tea bags in hot water, allow them to cool a little, squeeze out excess liquid and then apply to your eye area., It might be difficult, but try to exercise in the morning. Exercise increases blood flow, releases feel good hormones, and gives you a nice glow.If you can, get in 30 minutes of exercise, but even a brisk 10 minute walk can get the blood flowing.

, You know that some sunbathing will give you back your summer glow, but you don't want to make your seasonal beach debut looking pasty.


Zap any acne or blemishes with a salicylic acid cream. Don't forget to treat your back and other hard-to-reach areas.
Treat yourself to a salon spray tan or apply a good self-tanning treatment at home to tide you over until the sun's rays take effect.
Exfoliate your skin and moisturize it to get rid of winter dryness before you apply a tanning treatment. Your skin will be healthier, and your tan won't look streaky and spotty.
Use a moisturizer with retinol to attack fine lines and to fight the aging effects caused by UV rays.

, You'll need flawless feet and gorgeous hands to go with that new bathing suit that you want to rock. Choose an eye-catching polish in coral or turquoise to put yourself in a summer frame of mind. Just remember: If you are swimming in chlorine, the polish will wear off.

, Play up your long lashes with waterproof mascara or even eyelash dye. Choose a tinted lip balm that's at least SPF 15, and trade thick foundation for a tinted moisturizer with sun protection.

Invest in a high-quality haircut to get rid of split ends. Talk to your stylist about the best ways to eliminate frizz, and consider getting some sun-kissed highlights to give your hair a healthy glow.
Loosely curl your hair so that it tumbles over your shoulders. Also, invest in a cute hair clip or headband if you want to keep your hair back and out of your face.
Try going natural! Whether your hair is bone straight or afro-curly, letting out your natural texture gives you the perfect, down-to-earth beach look. If you think your hair is too straight, spray some salt water (or simply jump into the ocean) to get some beach waves. If you think your hair is too curly, you can use moose to keep your curls in control or braid part (or all) of your hair.
Wash all of the salt out of your hair when your beach day is done. Choose a moisturizing shampoo and a deep conditioner to keep your hair lustrous.

, If you're insecure about how you look, choose a suit that cinches in your tummy, tames your large bust or tones down your thighs.


Choose a color that looks great with your complexion and hair color. Bright colors work for basically all complexions, especially tanned or dark skin, but even a simple black bikini can be pulled off with the right confidence. You can also pick a strong pattern to distract from figure flaws.
If you want to cover up your stomach, try a ""tank-ini"" (a bikini with a top that reaches around your belly button) instead of a one-piece. If you want to cover your thighs, get a long sash-like skirt that you can tie around your waist. They're summery and still cover you up!
Remember that rocking a bathing suit is a confidence game. Hold your head up, walk with good posture and put some swing in your hips as you stroll along in the sand.
You don't have to wear a bikini. One pieces are just as sexy, and if you feel more confident with a modest swimsuit, go for it. Don't take too much pressure to wear a bikini. It isn't required. Do what is right for you.

, These can include a beach bag, a cute swimsuit cover, some killer sunglasses, a comfy beach towel, gorgeous flip-flops and a tent or umbrella for some shade.


Don't hesitate to enjoy some sports while you're trying to look fabulous. Bring a volleyball or a Frisbee so that you can have some fun in the sun.
Keep jewelry minimal. A thin gold chain can add some shimmer without creating any visual clutter.
You also need to be entertained while you sunbathe, so bring along a good book or some tunes. Pack some nutritious snacks and water bottles as well.

, Don't throw your chest out or do the obvious ""bend and snap."" Instead, while lazing on the beach, tanning or reading a book, prop yourself on your elbows and watch the ocean. When you chat with a friend, occasionally brush your hair from your face. Or casually bend your knee, which will instantly give you a toned look.

, All of your effort to look fabulous will be wasted if your skin is burned and peeling.


Very pale skin that burns easily should get sunscreen that's SPF 30 or higher (don't worry, you will still tan).
Darker or very dark skin are fine with regular SPF 15 sunscreen, but very dark skin tones should avoid getting titanium-based sunscreen because it can show up white/ashy on your skin after being in the water.

Focus on confidence and the right attitude!",How to Look Good for School (Girls)," If you want to look good for school, or just simply look good in general, you have to be healthy!


Make sure you drink lots of water each day. Drink at least six to eight cups. This will give you beautiful, glowing skin and clear up in acne.
Eat a healthy, balanced diet. Make sure to eat lots of fruits and vegetables and eat fat or sugary foods sparingly, especially at breakfast. A healthy breakfast will put you in a good mood for the day, therefore lightening your expression and preparing you for a long day of learning.
Exercise daily for about thirty minutes a day. If you're a busy person, simply go for a quick walk or jog. You can exercise at home too like jogging on the spot. If you are overweight, consider losing a few pounds. Don't diet obsessively though, just exercise.
Get enough sleep each night. At least nine or ten hours. A pale face with dark under eye circles isn't exactly pretty.;
,


Shower daily. To save time in the morning, you might want to shower at night, but showing in the morning can help you wake up - it's your choice! Wash your hair on a regular basis and clean your face and body. To have beautiful hair use hair products that are designed for your hair type. Use skin products that will work well with your skin type and use scented soap to achieve a subtle scent.
Wear an antiperspirant-deodorant. Apply it every morning to the underarms to help stay fresh.
Get rid of any unwanted body hair. Shave or wax your legs, trim your bikini line and do your eyebrows.
Wear panty-liners/pads/tampons and always carry spare in your purse just in case.
Brush your teeth. If you are unhappy with your teeth, consider investing in braces or whitening toothpaste. Never get a dark color of braces like orange, black, green, or anything like that. Go with a cuter color or clear. If you don't need braces, just brush your teeth, whiten them once a mouth (Use this sparingly, teeth whitening can weaken your teeth), use mouthwash and floss.

, Cleanse your face every morning and night. When cleansing, don't scrub. Instead, gently glide your fingers over your skin with a feather-light touch. Cleansing should be quick. It shouldn't take over ten seconds. If you take over ten seconds, you're stripping your skin of it's natural oils which leads to more pimples! Every morning apply a moisturizer. Make sure you don't use too much though or your skin will look oily. Use a spot treatment every night, regardless to whether you have acne or not. Using a spot treatment when you don't have acne will prevent you from getting any spots.

, Keep it natural and light. Maybe some mascara, cheek shimmer, lip gloss, and blush. Make sure your makeup matches your outfit and your skin tone/type. Nothing looks worse then flaky, orange foundation. Be sure to invest in good quality makeup, you don't want clumped mascara or eye-liner.


If you really want to play things up a bit, apply a thin line of black eyeliner on your upper lash line with a tiny flick at the end. Don't overdo it though.
Apply some lip balm and then a pretty lip tint. Lip tint is a great option for school as it lasts a long time. Be sure to apply lip balm when you use lip tint because lip tint can really dry out your lips making them look chapped, which is not so attractive.
If you need extra coverage, apply a tinted moisturizer or B.B cream. If you're not allowed to wear makeup at school but really would like to, cheat!
Curl lashes and apply a couple thin coats of brown mascara.

, Comb it until soft, and style it accordingly. Have your hair in a different style everyday for school. This is glamorous. Wear cute headbands or hair accessories! You could curl it, put it in a ponytail, a bun, a side ponytail, french braids, Dutch braids, one braid, two braids, a messy bun, ballet bun, neat bun,low ponytail, high ponytail, the list is endless! You could just put it down either, or ringlets if you can.


When you wash your hair, use a good quality shampoo and conditioner that smells nice. When rinsing your hair, use slightly cool water. This will maintain the shine in your hair.
Brush your hair daily. This will bring the oil from the roots of the hair to the tips, making it look super shiny and healthy. If you don't brush your hair daily, the oil at the roots will collect, making your hair look oily.
Consider going to a hairdresser. Get your hair cut stylishly (layers are cute) and if you're allowed to, highlight or dip-dye your hair a natural colour. If you want to look really cool, and if your school allows it, highlight or dip-dye your hair a cool colour like red if you have dark brown or black hair, blonde for light brown hair and pink for blonde hair.

, A hint of scent is sexy. Apply a sweet smelling perfume to your neck, wrists and elbows and spritz some over your clothes.

Release the hair with a sterile needle.,
Apply an antibiotic ointment to the affected area.,
Stop shaving, tweezing or waxing until the skin heals.,
See a doctor if the ingrown nose hair doesn’t heal.,
Keep your nose clean.,
Use a trimmer or scissors to remove nose hair.,
Use a depilatory cream.,
See a doctor for chronic ingrown hairs.",How to Treat Ingrown Nose Hairs," Ingrown hairs happen when you shave or tweeze hairs and they grow back into your skin instead of out of it.If you shave or tweeze your nose hairs, checking the internal and external nasal areas will help figure out if you have an ingrown nose hair.


An ingrown nose hair may present itself as an inflamed area with or without pain, and there may be a tiny, pimple-like bump where you removed the hair and it is trying to grow back.You may see these symptoms either on the outside or inside of your nose.Make sure to not stick your fingers or any other objects deep inside your nasal cavity. Instruments can lodge themselves in your nose, causing severe harm to you.
If you can’t locate the source of the pain or your ingrown hair, either leave it alone or see a doctor.;
, Most ingrown hairs will heal on their own.Leaving the ingrown hair in your nose will keep it from getting further inflamed as well as eventually healing it.If an ingrown nose hair is especially painful or problematic, you can use other self-cures to treat it including hot compresses and anti-bacterial ointments.

, Using warm to hot compresses can kill bacteria in an ingrown hair and reduce the pain.Try this treatment before you opt for a more invasive option such as releasing the hair.


Heat two glasses of water to a comfortable, hot temperature that won’t burn your skin. Dip a soft cloth or cotton swab in the water and put it on the affected part of your nose. When the cloth or swab cools, repeat the process once more. Do this procedure two to three times per day.You may gently insert the warm cloth or swab inside your nose if the ingrown hair isn’t deep within your nasal cavity.Press the cloth or swab gently against the ingrown hair for a few minutes.Gentle, circular rubbing the inside or outside area of your nose affected by the ingrown hair may help release it. It’s not unusual to see a small amount of pus or blood if you do this., If you feel comfortable and the ingrown nose hair is really bothering you, use a sterile needle to release the tip of the hair. This will help you remove it and any debris such as dead skin that may be inside of it.If you can see the hair, then it’s safe to release it.
After you’ve washed the area, insert a sterilized needles under the hair loop or loops and gently lift the ingrown hair tips either with your fingers or tweezers.Make sure that if you use a sterilized needle to release the hair that your skin is warm and moist.

It also helps to reduce swelling and pain and enhance the healing.You can use anti-biotic ointments such as neomycin, polymyxin B, bacitracin to prevent infection.These are available at most drug and grocery stores and their online retail sites.

, While you’re still suffering from an ingrown nose hair, it’s important to not shave or tweeze other hair in the area until it heals. Continuing to do these activities can not only cause further inflammation and pain, but also cause infections.You can tweeze only if it’s to release the ingrown hair as described above. Otherwise, leave the area alone.

, If your ingrown nose hair doesn’t heal within a few days and it gets very painful, see a doctor. He can make sure you don’t have a serious infection, remove the hair, or discuss other treatment options with you.


Additional treatments include retinoids, corticosteroids, and antimicrobials.

, Bacteria can inflame and infect ingrown hairs, and the nose is a prime location for bacteria growth. Keeping your nose clean both inside and out will inhibit the growth of infection-causing bacteria and help prevent ingrown hairs.


When you are sick, blow your nose completely into a tissue.
Don’t pick your nose. Your fingers can introduce bacteria into your nose that will infect an ingrown hair.

, Use either a trimmer designed specifically for the nose or a small pair of circular-ended scissors to groom your nose hair. These will keep you from cutting too closely to your skin, which encourages ingrown hairs.You can buy nose hair trimmers and small scissors at drug stores or department stores either online or in stores.
The best way to get at pesky nose hairs is to gently make a pig’s nose by pressing backward on the tip of your nose. This will help so see inside of your nose and make you less likely to cut yourself.Make sure to cut only those hairs sticking out and not any inside your nose, which help act as a barrier between your respiratory system and the outside world., A depilatory cream, which is a chemical hair remover, is another method to remove nose hairs effectively while helping to prevent ingrown hairs. These can be harsh, so test it on your skin before you use it to make sure it won’t burn the skin around your nose.Do not use depilatory creams inside your nose, which can cause serious harm.
Leave hair inside your nose alone as it helps keep out bacteria., If you find that you frequently have ingrown nose hairs, see your doctor to rule out conditions such as hormonal abnormalities. Your doctor can also help you find the best treatment and prevention for your chronic ingrown nose hairs.

Stick to this rule: Only wear one item of revealing clothing per outfit and don't wear anything that is extremely revealing, unless you want to.,
Ask yourself when you look in the mirror when wearing your next questionable outfit: Do I look beautiful or hot?,
Remember part of being labeled/called a slut is in the attitude and actions taken by a person.,
Recognize that some girls who dress skimpy only are trying to get attention because they can't get it any other way.",How to Tell The Difference Between Slutty and Sexy," Revealing clothing includes: micro mini skirts, very short shorts, low cut tops, backless tops, long skirts with thigh high slits and crop tops. Not wearing any of these together is suggested. Pop stars and film stars are frequently seen in sexy revealing outfits though so only follow this rule if you think it is relevant.;
, If you said ""hot"" then you may need to change your outfit. There is a subtle difference between beautiful and hot that many people can detect which, ultimately, influences the perception of ""trashy"" and ""sexy.""

, So if you skip the drama and quit acting spoiled and mean you shouldn't have problems with cute booty jeans and a cute top. You can be proud to be a slut if you wish. It's only other people who are defining your actions as slutty. Many people who bandy around the term slut have a very narrow minded, misogynistic definition of the term.

Moisturize your skin.,
Whiten your teeth.Unhealthy teeth can ruin a person's look, even if everything else is in top shape.,
Apply an anti-aging moisturizer.",How to Stay Beautiful1," Most people think of dieting as cutting back on food, or at least eating less of the things you want.Fortunately, this is not the case. Instead, a proper and sustainable diet replaces empty calories (like processed cheeseburgers and soda) with healthy alternatives. Depending on what your diet currently consists of, you can probably think of at least a few things you eat that your body would technically be better off without.


Whole foods, like green vegetables, are the key ingredient in a great diet. Eating well offers a ton of miraculous benefits to the body. If you're used to eating poorly, sticking to a good diet for a month may end up making you feel more lively than you did ten years ago.
Don't put too much credence into the so-called food pyramid. You are better off designing a meal plan that suits the specific needs of your body. There is a lot of debate regarding which foods are best health-wise, so it's best to do some of the research yourself.;
, Sleep is usually the first thing to be sacrificed in a busy schedule. This is a shame, as it accelerates the aging process and robs the body of its natural vibrance. Beauty sleep is a very real thing, and a sufficient amount of rest can do more for your looks than oodles of makeup.Remove all makeup before you go to sleep. Leaving it on can provoke negative reactions in your skin.Skin conditions like acne are known to improve when you get sufficient sleep.

Your body rehydrates itself while you're sleeping, and dark circles may be a sign you didn't give your body enough time to complete the process., Moisturizing your skin is a key component of keeping your skin looking young and healthy.Work a daily moisturizer treatment into your routine if you have not done so already. It's a good idea to do some research before you settle on a moisturizer. The most effective moisturizers aren't necessarily the priciest options.


Although there is some debate as to whether you should purchase a specific eye moisturizer for the area surrounding them, the delicate properties of eye-specific creams are better suited to controlling puffiness and eye wrinkles.Moisturizing your skin before sleep will help promote natural regeneration that occurs during rest., Stained teeth are very common to varying degrees, and even a great set of teeth can be brightened. A good place to start is by switching to a whitening toothpaste. Whitening gel strips are also available to bleach the enamel on your teeth. A great smile is an important part of being beautiful, so great teeth can't be overestimated.


You can get your teeth whitened more efficiently at a dental clinic.
If your dental health is in moderate to severely bad shape (such as in the case of missing or broken teeth) you are highly recommended to go see a dentist about the problems. Teeth can be repaired or reconstructed, though it may be costly if your insurance does not cover it.

, As you age, your skin will inevitably change. This is not a bad thing by itself, although many women don't care for the faded complexion and wrinkles that result from it. Anti-aging creams and moisturizers are designed specifically to combat these issues.If aging is a concern for you, purchase some and apply as per the product's instructions.


Some aging issues can be slowed down by proper eating and good sleep.

Put all your other makeup on first before applying your magnetic false eyelashes. Otherwise, the lashes could smudge your other makeup during the application process., Magnetic false lashes only cover the outer corners of your eyes. Apply mascara to the lashes on the inner corner of your eye before applying false lashes. This will balance out the look.Opt for a mascara tube that comes with a smaller brush. This makes it easier to target only a small portion of your lashes.

, Liquid eyeliner tends to stick to false eyelashes. This can decrease how long they last. If you wear eyeliner, opt for pencil eyeliner when wearing magnetic false eyelashes.In general, any liquid-based makeup should not be used around your eyes when you're wearing false eyelashes.

, Be very careful not to get mascara on your false eyelashes. Keeping false eyelashes clean will help them last longer. Remember to only apply mascara before applying your magnetic lashes., Wherever you're applying your lashes, lay a microfiber cloth down in front of you.

Adjust your makeup routine to account for age.,
Highlight your eyebrows.,
Tend to dark eye circles.,
Plump your lips.",How to Stay Beautiful2," It should go without saying that different cosmetic techniques will work differently as your face changes naturally.Though you shouldn't aim to make yourself look the way you did ten years ago, you should focus on accommodating based on gradual changes.


Wrinkles appear with time: This is absolutely okay, and not inhibitive to beauty at all. While any wrinkles make your face more distinguished, using a concealer to take the edge off of them is an effective trick if you feel you're better off without them.
Eyelids tend to droop as years go by. This makes eyeliner more important as time passes, and other things like eyeshadow generally less effective., Eyebrows frame the face.With that having been said, the importance of giving them attention increases as you age, as eyebrows tend to thin out by middle age. This issue is easily accommodated for with eyebrow pencil.


Some people have had eyebrows permanently tattooed, but the safety of doing so has been a point of debate amidst medical circles., Dark eye circles are a common ailment, and are usually intensified by a lack of sleep or stress. They have the nasty effect of making you look more bloodshot than you really are. Using a concealer and spreading it around the area below your eyes does a lot to liven up your look., Lips are a primary sign of health in the face. Highlighting this part of your face is a great idea if you want to appear more beautiful. A lip-plumping lipstick works well in tandem with a lip liner. It should be mentioned that you don't want to overdo it with the plumpness. Like anything cosmetics related, going too far has a comic effect; you want to make it look natural above all else.As lips age, cosmetics like lipstick have a tendency to sink into the wrinkles. Try your best to avoid this, and keep your application light.
Keeping your lips moist is an important part of making them look their best. Shea butter is an effective solution for this.

Understand the things that factor into beauty.,
Develop self-confidence.,
Give off a cheerful disposition.,
Smile.,
Dress beautifully.,
Make a habit out of good posture.There are many great benefits to good posture, not least of all the way it inevitably affects the way you think of yourself.",How to Stay Beautiful3," If you want to stay beautiful, it should be acknowledged that an overall impression of beauty means much more than pure looks alone. It is the impression of someone you would like to get to know more. This is why we are sometimes attracted to people who are not conventionally good looking; it's because they make up for it in other ways.


Attitude and charm can mean just as much as looks alone. Someone who exudes confidence will be seen as more beautiful than someone who is self-loathing, regardless of the way either of them physically look.

, Is there really anything more beautiful than self-confidence? Believing in oneself is a beautiful thing, and it never wears out regardless of the age you are or the country you live in.If you're low in self-confidence, it manifests itself in a lot of ways. The way you act an deal with people, and even the way you present yourself in body language is affected. Of course, gaining self-confidence is easier said than done for most people, but it can do more for the way you're perceived than any amount of fine makeup or clothing.


If you think you are beautiful, other people will think so too. Give it a shot, and see how others react.

, It is a shame that people take beauty for a purely physical thing. It also has to do with the way someone makes other people feel. Having a cheerful disposition in your daily interactions with people will make them look at you differently. Someone who feels good to be around will seem naturally better looking than a person who gives off the opposite effect. Put an emphasis on demonstrating welcoming body language, and be mindful of the things you say around other people., Although some peoples' smiles shine more brightly than others, no sincere smile was ever unwelcome. Someone who is glum and miserable looking is far less likely to be seen as beautiful than someone who is flashing their pearly whites for all to see. Smiling should come as a natural reaction for you when you're around people. While smiling often plays into self-confidence, smiling on instinct is a habit that can and should be learned. Practice in the mirror daily until you find yourself smiling without even thinking about it.


A smile doesn't just come from the mouth, but the eyes as well.If you're trying to force a smile, your mouth will give off a different emotional response than your eyes, which are much harder to fake.

, Staying up to date on fashion can be an expensive habit.Luckily, it doesn't need to wear out your wallet if you're set on looking beautiful. As with many things in the fashion world, there is no single rubric you need to be following. As beauty is in the eye of the beholder, you should focus on carving out a style that works for you uniquely. Don't bother hopping on trends. A long-lasting beauty is created by oneself, and fashion trends are notoriously short-lived.


Don't let yourself get hung up on trying to look young. As women age, there is a pressure to cling to youthful fashions. Don't reject a look because you think it makes you look old. Those who accept age gracefully are perceived most beautifully.
If you're having trouble carving out a look for yourself, you might take a look at some celebrities you admire. Although celebrities are probably more glamorous than you're looking to be on a regular daily basis, it's still a great starting point when it comes to inspiring your own look.

, If you think of the ideal beautiful person in your mind, chances are she isn't slumped over somewhere. Good posture denotes high levels of confidence, and confidence is one of the most beautiful things around.

, Start at the side of your nose and brushing up over your cheekbone toward your eyes. This will put the focus on your cheeks and eyes instead of your nose.

, This is another trick that when combined with the others can draw the attention away from a large nose. You don't have to go too heavy, but just using a basic dark mascara and liner will give you a dramatic and sophisticated look.

, If you find any blemishes, use a bit of spot touch-up make up on the nose so they don’t draw any more attention to the size. Pimples and acne can draw attention toward your nose even more.

, This is very important when trying to achieve any desired makeup look. By filling is your eyebrows a bit closer together will instantly make your nose look much more slender than before.

Use a volumizing shampoo and conditioner.,
Wash with a clarifying shampoo once a week.,
Apply a volumizing mousse.,
Use a diffuser attachment on your hair dryer.,
Dry your hair upside down.,
Use dry shampoo.",How to Volumize Your Hair1," The first, most obvious thing you can do to volumize hair is to use a volumizing shampoo and conditioner. These have a lighter formula than most other shampoos and conditioners, meaning that they won't weigh hair down, causing it to lie flat against the scalp. They will effectively clean and moisturize hair, while also leaving it light and bouncy. There is a volumizing shampoo and conditioner combo available for every budget, from drugstore favorites to fancy salon brands.


When shampooing, use enough product to create a lather. Make sure to massage the shampoo into the scalp, as this will help provide volume once the hair is dry. Rinse your hair thoroughly, then shampoo again if necessary.
Apply conditioner from the mid-lengths of the hair to the tips, using any leftover product near the roots. Applying too much conditioner to the roots may make it look greasy and flat.
While the conditioner is still in your hair, comb out any tangles with a wide-tooth combing, starting at the bottom and working your way up. This will help to prevent breakage, which can make hair look thin.;
, Most shampoos and conditioners contain plastic-type substances such as silicon and polymers which stick to the hair shaft and weigh the hair down, making it flat and lifeless. Clarifying shampoos remove these built-up chemicals and other deposits, making your hair lighter and more voluminous. Most people should use a clarifying shampoo once a week, for best results.


As well as shampoos, hair care products such as mousses, waxes and sprays contain chemicals which build up in the hair, causing it to lose volume. In addition, things like hard water and chlorine from swimming pools can leave deposits in the hair.
People who swim frequently are more likely to have built-up deposits in their hair, so they should use a clarifying shampoo more frequently, perhaps 2 to 3 times a week. People with colored hair should use it less frequently, about twice a month, as clarifying shampoos can also strip color from the hair.

, There are many, many hair volumizing products on the market, some of which are extremely effective. One such product is volumizing mousse, a dollop of which can be worked through wet hair from the roots to the tips to add texture and lift. After applying, you can either allow hair to air dry naturally, scrunching to achieve voluminous waves and curls, or you can blow dry the hair for a sleeker look with added lift.









Other recommended volumizing products are root-lifting sprays or creams. These are worked directly into the roots (from the ears up) before blow-drying.
Some volumizing products can be very drying on the hair, so be careful not to overuse them.

, Using a diffuser attachment on your hair dryer is a great option if you're looking for naturally voluminous curls. A diffuser softens the airflow from the hair dryer, so the hair is not blown straight and flat. Diffuser attachments can be purchased online, or at drug stores and hair salons. The best technique for using a diffuser is as follows:









Allow hair to dry naturally for 15 to 20 minutes after washing, then apply a volumizing mousse from root to tip, as described above.
Turn the hair dryer on, set the air to cool and dry hair upside down, using a scrunching technique.

, Whether you're going for a straight or curly look, drying your hair upside down is a surefire way to add volume. Drying upside down allows gravity to lift the roots of your hair away from the scalp and enables you to brush through your hair without flattening it.









Using a nozzle attachment on the hair dryer, flip your head upside down and roughly dry your hair for 5 to 10 minutes, using your fingers to separate sections of hair and let air through the roots. This gets rid of the excess moisture.
Once hair is semi-dry, switch to using a round, soft-bristled brush to finish drying and add a smooth finish to the hair. If your hair is very thick, you can separate hair into sections before doing this.

, If you don't have time to wash and blow-dry your hair, a quick and easy way to add some volume is by using dry shampoo, in either spray or powder form. Dry shampoos work by soaking up oil in the hair, leaving it feeling clean and fresh, with an extra boost of volume. All you need to do is spray or shake a generous amount of dry shampoo into the roots and massage it in with your fingers.









You may need to use a process of trial and error to find a dry shampoo that works for you, as some products can leave a residue in the hair or can leave hair feeling sticky.
Like many other hair products, dry shampoo can be very drying on the hair so avoid over-relying on this handy product.

Get a haircut.,
Experiment with color.,
Tease your hair.,
Change your parting.,
Use hot rollers.,
Get a perm.",How to Volumize Your Hair2," The longer your hair is, the heavier it will be, which explains why long hair often lacks volume. Therefore, one of the fastest ways to add volume is to get a haircut. Some well-placed, expertly cut layers, or even a blunt-ended cut can immediately make hair lighter and fuller -- not to mention healthier looking.


Go to a hair stylist who you trust and who listens to exactly what you're asking for. A good, professional haircut will give more life to your hair than any product or styling method.

, Well-placed highlights and lowlights can give the impression of depth and thickness to your hair, making it appear more voluminous than it actually is. Dark colors will also make your hair look thicker than lighter ones, so consider going a shade or two darker to give the illusion of volume.


A professional color job or set of highlights will do much more for your hair than a home dye kit. This is due to the fact that trained hairdressers can mix different shades and tones to find a color that's just right for you, giving your hair an added dimension that just cannot be achieved out of a box.

, An extremely effective way of adding volume is to tease (or backcomb) your hair. Teasing may seem intimidating at first, but it really is so easy to do and can be used to give some extra oomph to any and every hairstyle. Teasing works best on one or two day old hair, and requires a fine-toothed comb. Special teasing combs can be found at most beauty supply stores. The correct method for teasing hair is as follows:









After washing with a volumizing shampoo and using a volumizing mousse or lifting spray, leave your hair for a day or two before teasing. Part your hair as normal, then take a one to two inch section of hair from the crown of your head. Comb through it to remove any tangles.
Hold the hair vertically, grasping the ends. Insert the comb into the mid-shaft and comb the hair backwards, towards the scalp. No need to be gentle -- teasing works better when you're a bit rough. Repeat two or three times then move onto the next section of hair, working your way around your head.
You can backcomb your whole head, or just do the top sections -- it's up to you. Don't worry if it looks like a bird's nest -- it's supposed to at this point. Next, take the comb and very lightly smooth down the top layer of hair, leaving the under-layers untouched. Spritz with some hair spray to hold and voilà! Volumized hair that's perfect for any hairstyle!, If your hair naturally lies flat once it settles in it's normal parting, you can give it an instant lift simply by changing the parting. Go for something different than usual, whether it's straight down the middle, a dramatic side parting, or even a zig-zag one! Use a fine-toothed comb or hair pick to make it look precise, then brush the hair into place before spritzing with a little hairspray to hold.








, Hot rollers are an excellent way to add bounciness and volume to your hair, with a touch of pin-up girl glamour. If you're not looking for tight curls, don't worry -- bigger rollers will add volume and life, but won't give a huge amount of curl to hair. When using, make sure the rollers are heated to the correct temperature before putting them in.Use the hot rollers on day old hair, if possible. Start with the front sections, rolling the the hair away from the face rather than underneath. Once all of the rollers are in, let them sit in the hair for 10 to 15 minutes or until they have cooled completely.
Liberally apply hairspray all over your head before removing the rollers. Once out, use your fingers to shake out the curls and remove any tangles. Lightly brush through the hair if you want a softer look.

, Even though most people associate the word ""perm"" with crazy, fuzzy 80s hair, perms are actually coming back into fashion and can be a great way to add volume and texture to hair (minus the poodle effect). Modern perms can provide any thing from corkscrew curls to soft beachy waves, depending on your personal preference. They are extremely easy to maintain and can last anywhere from two to six months.


Just make sure to have a consultation with your hair stylist first to determine if you have the right hair type and that the two of you are on the same page with regards to how the final result will look. Bring pictures for inspiration.
Perms are not a good idea if your hair is heavily colored or highlighted, as the perm will dry out your hair even further, causing it to look frizzy and damaged. Getting layers cut into your hair is a good idea however, as these will prevent the perm from turning your hair pyramid shaped."

You can buy the comb from your local pharmacy, medical supply store, grocery store or large retailer.Read the label to make sure that you have a lice comb. This type of comb will have tooth spacing of 0.2-0.3mm in order to capture the smallest lice. It may also be black to help you more effectively identify individual louse. Avoid getting a nit comb, because they often cannot detect individual louse or lice as well as lice combs.Remember that regular combs are also not suitable for detecting lice. They don’t effectively detect lice and might even reintroduce lice back into your hair.;
, Use a regular comb to straighten and detangle your hair. This prepares your hair for using the lice comb. In addition, it may also help you more effectively detect lice.Consider wrapping a towel around your shoulders to catch falling hair that may have lice. This may keep lice from transferring to other people or areas of your home.
Throw away the comb after using it to prevent re-infestation or transmission to another person.
Wash and dry the towel by itself on the hottest settings possible to prevent transmission or re-infestation., Systematically combing through all of your hair minimizes the risk of not seeing lice. Pulling your hair into individual sections can ensure that you comb your entire head.


Use clips or hair bands to create individual sections. Remove the clips or bands before you comb a new section. Make sure to throw away any hair bands and sterilize clips after use to prevent re-infestation or transmission to others.

, Once a regular comb moves easily through the hair, run the lice detection comb through your hair. Make sure to comb each individual section so that you don’t miss any lice.Comb each section of hair from the scalp to the end three to four times. Repeated combing can ensure you effectively detect any lice in your hair.
Be aware that lice will quickly move away from any disturbance in dry hair. Wet lice remain still, which is why wet combing may be more effective at detecting lice., As you comb each section, make sure to examine the comb for individual louse with each pass.Lice may look like dandruff, hair product residue, other small insects, or beads of dead hair tissue.Examine hair under a bright light or with a magnifying glass to best see any lice. Trap lice that you find between your thumb and the comb. This prevents the louse from getting free or static electricity from your hair from repelling it. Put the louse on a piece of tape and then throw it away to prevent transferring lice to another person.

, If you find a live louse, you can be confident that an active infestation is present. However, if you are unsure about something you’ve found, attach it to a piece of tape, put it in a Ziploc bag, and take it to a pharmacist, doctor, or other healthcare professional to confirm a case of lice.Take steps to treat the lice infestation as soon as you confirmation an active case.

, You can use an different medications to treat a lice infestation. Start with over-the-counter remedies and switch to a prescription medication if your lice don’t respond to initial treatment. Wash your hair with shampoo and no conditioner before applying the medication. Rinsing hair with vinegar before application can also help. Follow the packaging instructions for any lice treatment you use. Read labels for products containing the following medications:


Permethrin, in products such as Nix
Pyrethrin with additives, in products such as Rid and A-200 Lice Killing
Benzyl alcohol, in prescription products such as Ulesfia
Malathion, in prescription products such as Ovide, Comb the length of wet hair with a fine-toothed comb, lice comb, or nit comb if you want to avoid chemical treatments. This can remove some lice and nits if repeated over several weeks.Wet hair with water and apply hair conditioner for easier combing. Section off the hair and run the comb over the length of each section at least twice. Wipe the comb clean with a tissue and run it through hot water after you’ve combed each section.Repeat wet-combing every three to four days for several weeks or until you don’t see any lice.

, Natural plants oils may kill lice and soothe any itching you experience. Be aware that essential oils are not approved by the Federal Drug Administration to treat lice and may not meet safety or efficacy standards.Choose an essential oil sold at a health food store, pharmacy, or even your grocery store. Some essential oils that can kill lice are tea tree oil, anise oil, ylang ylang. Other options include neroli, ginger, jasmine, and lavender.Mix about 50 drops of your oil with 4 tablespoons vegetable oil. Apply the oil mixture to your entire head and cover with a plastic shower cap. After this, wrap your head with a towel for an hour before shampooing to remove lice., Different household products, such as mayonnaise, can kill lice by depriving them of air.Coating your hair with any of these products and leaving them on overnight may kill lice.Use mayonnaise, butter, petroleum jelly, or olive oil to smother lice. Make sure to coat your entire head with your chosen product. Cover your head with a shower cap and leave it on overnight. In the morning, remove the product with baby oil. Then shampoo and thoroughly rinse your hair.Repeat the process until you can’t find any lice.

, Never treat lice with products that are flammable. Some people may recommend covering your hair in kerosene or gasoline, but these can seriously harm your health and may catch on fire if exposed to open flames., Although lice don’t generally live longer than one day off of the scalp, it’s advisable to clean household items. Wash and clean any personal items used within the past two days to minimize the risk of transmission to others.Wash fabrics including bedding, towels, clothing, and stuffed animals in hot and soapy water. Set your washer to at least 130 degrees Fahrenheit (or 54.4 degrees Celsius).
Wash personal care items like brushes and combs in hot, soapy water. Soak the item for 5-10 minutes. Then dry the item thoroughly with a tissue or paper towel.
Seal non-washable items in a plastic bag for two weeks. This can deprive the lice of air and kill them.

, Use the type of shampoo and conditioner you use on a daily basis. Follow the same routine as you normally would when you wash and condition your hair. Do not use a leave-in conditioner., Do not fully dry your hair. Your hair will need to be wet when you wrap it. Instead, gently remove the excess water from your hair by squeezing it with a towel. You can also use your hands to remove the excess water.







, Setting lotion is used to help your hair stay in position as it being wrapped and when it is wrapped. Use a generous amount of setting lotion and massage it through your hair from root to tip. Any type of setting lotion will work as long as the label states that it is meant for styling and moisturizing







, Once you have used the setting lotion, use a wide-toothed comb to work out any tangles or kinks. Using a comb will also distribute the styling lotion evenly throughout your hair. Part your hair in the center and comb through your hair again. Bend forward and comb if you are having trouble detangling.








Gently use the comb to avoid breakage.

, You can also choose to sweep it counterclockwise instead of clockwise. Use your hands to direct your hair. Comb your hair in a circular motion away from the part. Smooth your hair down around your head and continue wrapping until you have flattened all the hair around your head.

Plastic styling brushes can be found at most beauty supply shops.

To use a hand-held dryer, put it on the highest heat setting and blow dry over the entirety of the cap. It may take a couple of hours to fully dry your hair.








You can buy hooded hair dryers online or at a beauty supply store.

, Unwrap your hair when it is dry, and comb your hair in the opposite direction with the wide-toothed comb. Style your hair the way you normally would. If you prefer to wait until later to style your hair, leave your hair wrapped and cover your head with a silk scarf.








If done correctly, your hair should be shiny and straight when you comb it out.

, You will need to wrap your hair on a nightly basis to maintain the same hair style. Repeat the process of wrapping that you initially carried out. It should be easier and less time consuming now that your hair has been detangled and straightened.








Repeating the wrapping on a nightly basis may not be necessary if your hair stays straight for several days. If your hair stays as you desire, then you may only need to wrap it once a week.

, Once you have finished wrapping your hair, clip or tie your hair into place and sleep in it. You can use the same clips you used initially, but it may be uncomfortable to sleep with clips in your hair. A better option is to use a hair wrap or scarf to protect your hair.Designate a hair wrap or scarf to use at night instead of using a nice one that you would wear with outfits during the day.

Your hair should be evenly damp from root to ends, but it should not be soaking wet.

Well done!","How to Wash Your Hair and Prevent Damage, Splits, and Dryness"," These are often known as 'shower-sprays', 'shampoo-sprays' or 'shower attachments'. They fit onto the taps/faucets with suction cups so that you can wash your hair by leaning over the bath or sink/basin. This allows you to access all points of your head without weighing your hair down, or creating tangles. You can create volume, further cleanliness and accessibility by being at this angle - you wouldn't be able to do this in the shower! You can also withstand colder temperatures that are beneficial for your hair, but you wouldn't like for your body.;
,, Using the hand-held shower, thoroughly wet your hair with lukewarm water and continue for 80 seconds. The more damp your hair is, the better it will wash. Lift up your hair (gently, now!) and make sure that you get in all the nooks and crannies.

, Allow some of the droplets of water dripping from your hair to gather in your hand - then rub the shampoo in your hands and lather it up on your scalp.

, Do this for 30 seconds. If you have very oily hair, or if you have used an oil treatment, you might want to do it for 1 minute.

,,,, Although this may seem like a long time, the longer and better you rinse, the longer and better your hair can be!

,, The rules for how to use conditioner are pretty simple - if you have used an oil treatment on the scalp before washing (always recommended), you don't need to apply conditioner to the scalp. If you haven't used an oil treatment, then feel free to condition the scalp, too.

,, To activate the conditioner, you might want to use slightly warmer (not hot) water. Do this for 2 minutes.

,,,, Your hair should be soft, sensual and manageable.

Spritz sea salt throughout your hair.,
Tousle your hair.Evenly spread your fingers throughout your hair, then give your locks a good shake.,
Allow the spray to dry.",How to Use Sea Salt Spray2," Wash your hair using a normal or hydrating shampoo, then dry your hair using cool heat.


Avoid clarifying shampoos since they can strip your hair of its natural oils, which may reduce the textured effect you're trying to achieve.
The cool heat setting of your hair dryer is ideal since it should dry your hair without creating excess frizz. Avoid high heat settings. Don't towel dry your hair, either.

, Lightly coat your hair with sea salt spray, applying it from root to tip. Use a comb to brush the product through evenly.


Unlike beach waves, bead head styles should also extend throughout your entire hair instead of remaining restricted to the lower half. As such, you'll need to apply it to your roots.
You only need to use a light spritz, however. Applying too much can weigh your hair down, making it look flat and messy instead of voluminous.

, Continue shaking and mussing your hair until you've achieved your desired look.


For a more subtle approach, keep your hands off and simply shake your head back and forth. This should give you greater texture while keeping the mess to a minimum.
For an even messier look, tip your head upside-down while you tousle your hair with your fingers.

, The sea salt spray should dry quickly. Once it does, the resulting look should look like messy, yet controlled, bed head.


Avoid touching or combing your hair after your style sets. The more you mess with it, the quicker your hair will flatten out again.

Spray the bottom half with sea salt.Lightly spritz sea salt spray over your curls, working from the mid-section down to the ends.,
Pick apart the curls.,
Let the spray dry.",How to Use Sea Salt Spray3," Wash your hair using a normal or curl-enhancing shampoo. Blow dry your hair using cool heat and a diffuser attachment.


Before you can loosen your curls, you'll need to create curls that will actually hold. Moisturizing shampoos and curl-enhancing shampoos will help you do that. If you use a normal shampoo, follow it with a matching condition to lock in additional moisture.
Cool heat will limit frizziness. The diffuser isn't strictly necessary, but it can help you add more waviness to your hair.

, Apply curl serum to your hair, if desired, then tightly curl your hair using your favorite styling method.


If you've never curled your hair before, consider using a curling iron.

Turn on the curling iron.
While it heats up, comb your hair and split it into sections.
Clamp the curling iron near the bottom of one section, then wrap your hair around the side, working up to your desired height. Hold the hair for 10 seconds before releasing the curl.



,


Avoid spraying too much sea salt since it can weigh down your curls and flatten them out.
You should also avoid spraying the roots of your hair. It shouldn't cause much harm if you do, but the sea salt spray won't be very effective there.

, Working at random intervals, pinch your curls between your fingers. Rub your fingers back and forth to loosen the curl before moving onto the next one.


Don't spend too much time on each curl. The idea is to loosen perfectly locked curls and give them a messier, more natural look, but playing with them too much can cause them to come completely undone.

, The sea salt spray should dry within a minute or so, and your curls should look softer and a little looser while still holding their form.

Skip the wash.Use this technique on hair that hasn't been washed in 24 to 48 hours.,
Thoroughly spray sea salt throughout your hair.,
Comb it through.,
Let it dry.",How to Use Sea Salt Spray4,"


Sea salt spray is a good way to give a style pick-me-up to flat, day-old hair. Using it allows you to look good while skipping time between washings, and giving your hair a break from daily shampooing can help it stay moist and healthy.
You can use this trick on flat hair that's been washed less than 24 hours ago, too, but the effect will be more noticeable after the first day passes.

, Spritz your hair with sea salt spray, working from root to tip.


The coating should be thorough yet light. Your hair should feel a little damp to the touch after you're done, but it should not look notably wet or soaked.

, Use a wide-toothed comb to spread the sea salt spray evenly throughout your hair. Brush outward, working in sections from root to tip.


It's important to comb outward instead of combing straight down. Combing straight down will spread the sea salt but won't give your hair much lift. Combing slightly outward, on the other hand, will coax your hair to lift away from the sides and top of your head.
Play around with your comb until you achieve the look you desire. You may need to comb from the underside of your hair to gain further lift, or you may need to swap to a large, rounded brush.

, As long as you didn't use too much, the sea salt spray should naturally dry within a few minutes. Your hair should have about as much volume and wave as it does immediately after washing it.


In addition to giving flat hair more texture, the sea salt spray should also mask the grease in your hair, making it look less oily, too.

Wash and dry your hair.,
Coat your hair with sea salt spray.,
Pin up your hair.,
Lock it in place with another spritz.,
Let everything dry.",How to Use Sea Salt Spray5," Wash your hair using a normal shampoo and conditioner, then dry it using a low heat setting on your hair dryer.


It's best to avoid clarifying shampoos since they'll strip oil and texture out of your hair, effectively counteracting the sea salt spray.
You don't need to add other products to your hair, but if you'd like to add an anti-frizz serum, mousse, or other styling agent, do so after washing your hair and before moving onto the next step.

, Spritz sea salt spray through your hair from root to ends. Use a comb to evenly spread the product throughout your hair.


Apply a fairly generous amount of sea salt spray. Your hair should be somewhat damp to the touch, but it should not look or feel drenched.

, Gather your hair into your favorite updo or your favorite bun.


You can use this technique with nearly any updo, but it'll have the most dramatic effect on traditionally sleek styles like French twists and tight chignons.
When using sea salt spray with traditionally messy updos, the extra texture should slightly accentuate the style but won't make it look much different from usual.

, After pinning up your hair, apply a final, light spray of sea salt to your hair to help lock the style in place.


Essentially, you're using the sea salt spray as though it were a standard hairspray during this step.
If there are any loose locks hanging down from your updo, you can give them a gently twist after applying this final spritz to give them more definition and character.

, Allow your hair to air dry. Once it finishes, your hair is ready to show off.


The texture provided by the sea salt spray should help prevent your hair from sliding out of place, which may increase the longevity of your updo.
The additional texture should also give classic updo styles a chic, modern twist.

, You can use conditioner as a quick and easy way to clean your face and remove makeup. This is also a great way to save room in luggage when you are traveling.Simply wet your face with warm water and massage the conditioner onto your skin. Wash it off completely when you are done, and be sure not to get any in your eyes.
If you wear contacts, make sure you take them off before washing your face., Hair conditioner can provide a closer shave than shaving foam, and it moisturizers your skin. It can also be easier to see the spots you may miss because of its thinner consistency., When dyeing your hair, hair conditioner can be used to line your hairline to help protect your skin from being dyed. It also helps to remove random dye marks from your skin after you have washed the dye from your hair.


Apply the conditioner to your hairline with your fingers or a washcloth.
To remove dye stains from your skin, gently rub the spots with hair conditioner and a wet washcloth. Be gentle, and use circular motions to avoid skin irritation.

, If you have ever had an ""impossible to get off"" Band-Aid or temporary tattoo, try rubbing them away with conditioner.


For pesky Ban-Aids, apply conditioner over the two sticky strips and wait about 30 seconds for the conditioner to soak through and loosen the adhesive. Then you are good to go.

Ramp up your current color with a tinted gloss.,
Use a gloss to get rid of brassiness.,
Experiment with different glosses.",How to Use Hair Gloss1," If you want to improve the condition and shine of your hair without changing the color, opt for a clear gloss treatment. Color-free hair gloss provides intense conditioning by actually lowering the PH level of your hair. Purchase an at-home treatment or visit a salon for a professional clear gloss application., To boost your current color or give it a slight twist, check out hair glosses in color tones that are within the range of your current color. Note that rich, golden hair tones can improve the look of your skin tone and make hair look shinier. In addition, warmer tones can boost how bright your hair looks, especially during cold, gray seasons.If you are unhappy with your current hair color and want to use hair gloss to change it, it is best to visit a salon to leave the treatment (and coloring choices) to a professional.

, Rescue your hair color from brassiness (due to factors such as sun exposure or hair products) with a balancing hair gloss. Purchase a shine gloss treatment in a cool color tone to minimize brass and add shine to your locks. Hair gloss is a cheaper and less-damaging alternative for repairing your hair color than frequent re-dyeing., Since hair gloss is a non-permanent hair treatment option, feel free to test different products to find the one that suits you best.

Separate easily tangled hair before washing.",How to Untangle Severely Matted Hair," Ordinary conditioner is worth trying if you haven't already, but if your hair is severely matted, you may need to resort to another option. Deep conditioners are great at restoring moisture to your hair and making them easier to untangle, while detangling conditioners are meant specifically to add more slip to your hair. Coconut oil, olive oil, or Moroccan argan oil can be used instead, and may be especially useful for afro-textured hair. If you dislike the feel of oil in your hair, you can try a hair detangling spray.


While some people use mayonnaise, this may cause an unpleasant smell and is unlikely to be more effective than other options.;
, Dampen your hair with a spray bottle of water, or briefly holding it under a shower or sink at low water pressure. Most hair treatments are meant to be applied to damp hair, but if you let the hair become dripping wet, it may be more susceptible to breakage., Take a handful of the chosen treatment, or use up to two handfuls if you have hair that grows past your shoulders. Apply the treatment thoroughly to all parts of your hair, including the ends. Rub it in to each section of your hair separately, rather than across your entire scalp at once, to avoid tangling your hair further.

, If using ordinary conditioner, it will finish moisturizing your hair within a few minutes. Coconut oil and similar oils should be left in for at least 30 minutes for maximum effect, but no longer than 2 hours. Deep conditioners vary as shown on the packaging instructions, but are typically left in for at least an hour, and may be left in overnight for extreme cases.


To keep your hair tidy and out of way, wear a plastic shower cap, or a plastic bag fastened with a hairband. Optionally, a tight-fitting hat over the plastic may help hasten the process.

, Once the hair treatment has had time to take effect, attempt to gently pull apart the tangled sections of your hair. Small knots or loose mats can sometimes be pulled into smaller, separate tangles from the root side of the knot, nearer to your scalp.


Don't expect to fully untangle your hair during this step. If you feel tension, stop and try a different tangled area.

, A comb with sturdy, widely spaced teeth is essential for combing out severe tangles. Fine combs and brushes are likely to meet too much resistance, forcing you to either pull out clumps of hair, or stop brushing.


Be sure to pick a comb that doesn't have teeth so wide that smaller tangles slip through.

, Always comb tangled hair starting near the ends. Place the comb a few inches (several centimeters) from the end of the tangled hair, and brush downward. Repeat until that section of hair is free of tangles, then move the comb slightly higher up. Repeat until the entire length of your hair is combed. For long or thick, severely matted hair, this may take an hour or more.

, If you have a sensitive scalp, hold a section of your hair as you brush it. Grasp a portion of hair about the thickness of a marker or glue stick between your fingers, and give it a half-twist to keep the comb from pulling directly on your scalp. Comb this portion of hair beneath your hand, moving your grip higher once the hair below it is successfully untangled.

, Apply a drop of conditioner or oil to a tough knot and rub it in with your finger. This will help lubricate those hair strands further, reducing the amount they cling to each other.

, If a mat of hair refuses to come apart despite all your efforts, you may need to thin it out. Open a pair of scissors and hold your hair tight with your other hand. Run the bottom blade of the scissors along the underside of the mat, then gently tug at your hair to remove loose strands.


If it has been weeks or months since the last time you combed your hair, cutting mats out may be your best option, as you can spend hours detangling with no results.

, Use a wide-toothed comb until the severe mats and tangles have been straightened out. Switch to a fine-toothed comb or a brush to remove any small knots that may remain.

, Rinse out any hair treatments completely once your hair is untangled. If you have tightly coiled hair, and the severe mats have separated enough to allow you to part your hair, clip each section of hair to keep them separate, and rinse one at a time.

, Leave-in conditioners can be left in your hair for many hours at a time. They keep your hair moisturized, minimizing fraying and frizzling that can occur when your hair dries out.

, Too dry, and hair becomes brittle and hard to brush. Too wet, and it becomes weak and easy to pull out accidentally. Find the middle ground, brushing or combing when your hair is damp after a shower, but not dripping wet.

, If you wake up with your hair in a tangle, braid it before you go to bed to minimize the amount of tangling that can happen. Alternatively, you could put your hair in a bun.

, If you have afro-textured hair, or another easily tangled hair type, part it into several sections, and clip them to keep them apart. Unclip these sections one at a time when washing your hair, and clip them back together before unclipping the next section. This reduces the chance of larger mats forming.


A mild, low-sudsing shampoo without sodium lauryl sulfate is recommended for this type of hair.

Reapply your setting spray throughout the day.",How to Use Makeup Setting Spray," Just like all facial products, different products work best on different skin types. If you have very dry skin, you may want to avoid products with alcohol in them, which can dry out your skin even more. Instead, find alcohol-free setting sprays that have moisturizing and hydrating properties. If you have naturally oily skin, look for an oil-free setting spray.If you have combination skin, you can play around with different setting sprays until you find one you like. Many sprays are marketed for all skin types, so those would be a good place to start.;
, During hot, humid days, makeup has a tendency to “melt” off your face. Find a setting spray that is cooling and sweat-resistant. If you are in a cold climate or in the dead of winter, try a hydrating setting spray to protect your skin against the harsh, dry air., This is a matter of personal preference. Some people like their finished, make-up face to be matte and completely shine-free. Others prefer a dewy, glowing look. Make sure you take this into consideration when you are picking a setting spray. Some will mattify your face, and others will give you a bit of a dewy sheen., No matter how great our makeup looks, there is no better beauty hack than protecting it from the sun. If you are venturing out into the sunshine, find a setting spray that has SPF in it. Apply it to your face before heading out, and reapply it throughout the day.Not only will it help your makeup last flawlessly, but it will protect you from sunburns and other negative effects of sun exposure.

, Many people use a Beauty Blender, or a generic version of this well-known makeup sponge, to apply their liquid foundation. To use this sponge properly, you’re supposed to dampen it before applying makeup. Instead of using water, you can use setting spray to dampen the sponge.The moisture on the sponge will help blend and smooth the foundation easily and evenly.
The setting spray will also help prevent the foundation from coming off over the course of a long day.

, Many powder eye shadows go on very lightly, and it seems like you have to pack on multiple coats to get the bold, pigmented color you want. Setting spray can help with this. Take your shadow brush and dip it into the powder eye shadow you will be applying. Then, before you apply it to your lid, spray the brush with your setting spray. This will make the shadow more opaque and bold than the dry powder alone.The eye shadow will be damp going onto your lid, but it will dry quickly.
The setting spray will help your eye shadow stay in place and last all day, without smudging or creasing.

, To cover dark circles and make your eyes appear brighter, apply concealer under your eyes. Use your finger to dab a few dots of the product. Then, spray your concealer brush with setting spray before using it to blend in your concealer.By getting your concealer brush damp with the setting spray, you will make it easier to blend the concealer.
The setting spray will hydrate the delicate skin under your eyes, and it will also keep the concealer looking smooth and flawless, rather than splotchy or crease.

, Different sprays contain different ingredients, and many include ingredients that can settle to the bottom of the bottle. To make sure you are getting the proper mixture, give your bottle a few gentle shakes. You don’t need to shake it vigorously – just enough to mix it all up.

, Hold the bottle six to eight inches away from your face. You want to give your entire face an even misting, so don’t spray it closely. Spray the product a few times, making sure you get full, even coverage.


One way to ensure full coverage is to spray the setting spray in an “X” shape over your face, and then again in a “T” shape over your face., Once you’ve sprayed your setting spray, let your face air-dry. It won’t take too long for your skin to absorb the spray. Don’t rub or blend the spray anywhere on your face, or you will risk messing up your makeup., Throw the setting spray into your purse so that you can have it whenever you want it. Depending on the specific setting spray you’ve chosen, it can cool you off, mattify your makeup, and rehydrate your skin throughout the day."

This method would work well with pantyhose, unmentionables, woolens, and silk.

, While you don't want to buy hair conditioner in place of your regular fabric softener, you can use it in a pinch.


Simply add about 2/3 the amount of hair conditioner that you would normally add with fabric softener, and your clothes will be soft and smell great. , If you accidentally dried your favorite wool sweater, try to stretch it back out with water and hair conditioner.


Fill a sink with warm water, and add about a quarter-size drop of hair conditioner. Let the sweater soak for several hours before removing it, and then squeeze out any excess water. Lay the sweater flat on a towel, and begin to stretch it back to its original size.Use gentle tugs when stretching, and be sure to evenly stretch around the entire sweater., Hair conditioner not only softens your hair, but it also makes your makeup brushes soft, too. Makeup brushes also need to be washed every few months to stay sanitary, and washing them in hair conditioner is a great method to use.


Fill up a bowl with warm water and a quarter-size drop of hair conditioner. Take your makeup brushes and let them soak in the water for about five minutes. Use your fingers to massage the brush bristles to make sure the entire brush gets wet. When you are done, let the brush air dry."

While it can look great, it can also become easily smudged and dull.Rub on hair conditioner with a clean cloth to get your appliances smooth and shiny. When you are done, buff it off with a clean cloth. Before using any product on your appliances, always test an inconspicuous spot first to make sure there is no negative reaction.
Remove smudges and fingerprints from stainless steel appliances in the kitchen.
Apply to dull faucets and golf clubs to restore shine.

, Hair conditioner was developed to act as a protection for your hair, but it also works as a protector on metals too. Any metal area exposed to moisture in the air is vulnerable to rust. By applying small amounts of hair conditioner from time to time, you can prevent rust from forming.


Use a clean cloth to rub against surfaces that easily rust, such as drains, faucets, tools, and door hinges. When you are done, wash them clean with water.

, Snow and salt can eat away at leather boots, but hair conditioner can help protect them and restore moisture that may have been lost. By rubbing hair conditioner on shoe leather, it can create a protective coat that keeps salt from absorbing into your shoe which causes discoloration.Use a clean rag to work tiny amounts of conditioner into the leather, and be sure to get the entire surface. Wipe away any excess hair conditioner that doesn't absorb into the leather."

In the meantime, wash your hands to remove excess product from them. Rinse your hair thoroughly., Apply your regular conditioner to your hair. Rinse your hair a final time.

Correct a bad dye job with a gloss treatment.",How to Use Hair Gloss3," If you opt for a demi-permanent hair gloss, make sure not to choose a color tone more than two shades lighter or darker than your current color. A more dramatic shift in color should be handled professionally. If you wish for a more dramatic change, book an appointment for a gloss treatment at your local salon., When applying a demi-permanent hair gloss, follow the instructions exactly to ensure that you apply it correctly. Set an alarm on your phone to make sure that you leave the gloss on your strands for the exact recommended time. Follow directions about shampooing or conditioning hair (which may vary between products), which can affect how the gloss treatment works on your hair., Once you've applied a demi-permanent gloss treatment, take note of how long the manufacturer says it will last. For instance, some treatments are specified for weekly use, while others may last through approximately 28 shampoos. Do not apply another gloss treatment until the duration of the current one has run out.At most, a hair gloss treatment will last six weeks.

, If your recent hair coloring experience has left you with hair that is brassy, badly highlighted, or overly yellow or orange in tone, use a gloss treatment to even out your color.

Choose a hair crimper.,

Plug in the hair crimper.,
Decide what parts of your hair you want to style.,
Style hair in two-inch sections.,
Secure the style with hair spray.,
Finished.








",How to Use a Hair Crimper," These tools are available at most beauty supply stores, and come in a variety of different brands. Like hair straighteners and curling irons, they are plugged in and heated prior to styling. Unlike hair straighteners, crimpers have zig-zagged plates that create texture in hair.









Take the following into account when choosing a crimper: temperature settings (the higher the temperature, the more effective the styling will be), size of the styling plate, and ceramic versus metal plates.
Ceramic styling tools claim to cause less damage to hair, but regardless, all hot styling tools cause damage to hair with prolonged use.;
, Allow hair to completely dry, because the crimper won't work on wet hair. Be sure to condition your hair and brush out any tangles prior to styling.









If you are prone to frizzy hair, then apply a dime-sized amount of anti-frizzing serum.
To protect your hair from heat damage, you may want to apply a heat-protecting product like Argon Oil to the ends of hair prior to styling.

, Choose the appropriate heat setting and allow it to warm up for 3-5 minutes. The higher the heat setting, the more effective the styling will be. However, high heat settings also cause more damage to your hair. Consider this trade-off before styling.









You will need to have a mirror in front of you while styling, so plug the crimper into an outlet in your bathroom or bedroom where you have access to a mirror.

, You may want to crimp your entire head of hair, or simply isolate certain strips of hair for a quirkier look.








, Grab a section of hair with your non-dominant hand and gently clamp down the crimper using your other hand, starting at the roots. Get as close to your scalp as possible without burning it. Hold down for at least five seconds, and then release the clamps.









Slide the tool down the length of your hair and clamp down on the next section, and continue until the entire section is crimped.

, If your hair tends to not hold a style for very long, then spritz your hair with a styling spray for longer-lasting waves. Hairspray is also a good idea if you plan on being in windy weather or driving with the windows down.

Clear away any loose strands of hair that got snagged in the bobby pin.",How to Use a Bobby Pin1," Bobby pins are located in the aisle dedicated to hair accessories, and they are inexpensive.


You can buy higher quality bobby pins, if you choose. Salon professionals advise that they do a better job of holding your hair in place.Try spraying your cheaper bobby pins with hairspray or texturizing your hair before using them. Then, the bobby pins have more ability to grip your hair.;
, Start at your temple, or wherever along your hairline you would like, and slide the comb straight back along your scalp, toward the crown of your head.


A rattail comb works well for this because of its pointed tip.
If you do not have a comb, you can use your index finger; however, the part will likely not be straight.

, This pulls that chunk of hair away from any straggling hairs from the lower area of your hair.

, Here are a couple of tips for doing this:


If you parted the section of hair on the left side of your head, pinch the hair with your left hand. This frees up your right hand to reach across to slide in the bobby pin.
Likewise, if you parted the section of hair on the right side of your head, pinch the hair with your right hand. This way, your arms are not getting crossed and tangled in front of your head.

,


This method provides a better grip on your hair so that the bobby pin stays in place.

, Insert it at such an angle that the hair will be held in place:


Slide the bobby pin straight up, toward the top of your head, or at a slight angle toward the back of your head. Do not insert it completely horizontally or downward, because your hair will fall out of the pin.
This is a quick and simple method for pinning back your hair. However, it is likely that it will not hold for a long period of time, and you will probably have to reinsert it.

, If these strands should not be secured within the bobby pin, then gently pull them down to clean up the appearance.

Avoid harshly scrubbing your skin – this won’t make it smoother, and it may irritate your skin more., Eczema can cause dry, flaky skin, so keep your skin as smooth and moist as possible by moisturizing regularly. Choose a rich, non-comedogenic (won’t clog your pores) moisturizer. Apply it to your face twice a day after a bath or shower while your skin is still moist., Invest in cosmetics that contain powdered silica, titanium dioxide, and zinc oxide. These mineral ingredients can help to hide the redness and inflammation associated with eczema.Mineral-based products are also less likely to contain water. Water-based products have to contain preservatives to prevent bacterial growth, which may irritate your skin., Some cosmetic products – familiarly called cosmeceuticals – include ingredients that reduce inflammation. This is a great option if you have eczema. Look for anti-inflammatory ingredients like niacinamide and antioxidants., Purchase products that are labeled hypoallergenic, or less likely to cause an allergic response. This is very important, especially for products that go all over your face like moisturizer or foundation.Select fragrance-free, dye-free products.

, Protect your skin from the sun without adding extra layers of product. Choose moisturizers or makeup that contain sunscreen of at least SPF 15., Shimmery products can enhance dry patches and problem areas, so stay away from products containing shimmer. Shimmer can also cause skin irritation, so is better avoided even on areas of clear skin., Because atopic dermatitis is like an allergic reaction, finding the right products may involve some trial and error. If a new product causes a flare-up in your eczema or redness, itching, or inflammation, throw it away. Note what ingredients it contained and try to avoid those ingredients. Try products one at a time until you find some that soothe your skin without causing irritation or allergic reaction.


Try to use only a few products at a time to reduce the risk of having a skin reaction. Choose moisturizer, foundation, and some accenting makeup and leave it at that.
If a product causes itching, redness, or irritation, stop using it immediately.

Instead, look for soft peach shadows that have some pink in them so they look more natural with your skin tone.Avoid peach eyeshadows that lean too orange. They are usually too warm for fair skin.;
, Medium skin tones can also wear light pinky peach shadows, but more intense peach shades tend to stand out more. Consider a mid-tone peach with stronger orange undertones.Mid-tone peach shadows will typically have “peach” in their shade names, such as “Candied Peach” or “Peach Pop.”

, If you have a tan complexion, you want to choose peach shadows that have enough depth to them to show up against your skin. Opt for bronzey peach shades that will complement the similar bronze tones in your own skin.Bronze peach shadows often have shade names such as “Golden Peach” or “Sunkissed Peach.”

, Dark skin can wear nearly any type of peach eyeshadow. However, for the most flattering look, it’s best to choose a bright, rich peach eyeshadow that will complement your deeper skin tone.Bright peach shades tend to have shade names such “Vivid Peach” or “Intense Peach.”

, In addition to the tones in a peach shadow, it’s also important to consider the finish. A matte peach shadow has no shine, glitter, or shimmer, while a shimmery or metallic peach shadow offers rich shine. A satin peach shadow isn’t completely flat, but only provides minimal shine.Matte peach shadows can work as a lid or highlight shade, but they’re especially good for using in the crease. They’re also the best option if you have mature or wrinkled eyelids because they won’t draw as much attention to fine lines.
Shimmery or metallic peach shadows are best used as lid or highlight shades.
Satin peach shadows can be used all over the eye.

, No matter what color eyeshadow you’re wearing, it’s important to apply a shadow primer to your eyelids first. The primer helps keep your eyeshadow in place all day and prevents creasing. Dab a small amount on each eyelid, and blend it in with a clean finger.If you don’t have an eyeshadow primer, you can use a little concealer instead.

, If you want your peach eyeshadow to be the star of your eye look, apply it to your eyelid. Use a flat eyeshadow brush to gently pat or press the shadow onto your lid for the most opaque peach color.Light or mid-tone peach shadows with a shimmery or metallic finish work best as lid shades.
If you really want the peach shadow on your lid to be bold and intense, consider using a peach cream eyeshadow as a base. Use a clean finger to dab the cream shadow on your lid, and then press a powdered peach eyeshadow in a similar shade over it.

, If you want to add warmth to your eye look with peach shadow but still keep it soft, blend it through the crease. Use a fluffy, tapered crease brush to lightly sweep the peach shadow through your crease.Your crease is the area where your eye lid naturally folds.
A mid-tone or dark peach shadow with a matte or satin finish works best as a crease shade.
If you’re working with a lighter peach shadow, it can actually serve as a transition shade. That’s a shadow that helps your crease shadow blend into your brow bone highlight. Use a very fluffy crease brush to lightly blend the shadow through the upper portion of your crease before you apply your actual crease shade.

, When you want the peach shadow to stand out and keep your overall eye look soft, it’s best to pair the peach with shadows in natural, earthy tones. Look for cream, ivory, beige, tan, taupe, gray, and brown shades that will allow the peach to pop.If you’re using a light peach shadow on the lid, pair it with dark tan, taupe, gray, or brown shades in the crease.
If you’re using a mid-tone or dark peach shadow in the crease, pair it with a cream, ivory, beige, or light tan shade on the lid.

, If you want to make a bold statement with your peach eyeshadow, pair it with contrasting shades. Blue is opposite orange on the color wheel, so shadows in blue tones will create the boldest contrast. Green shades can also work well for a bold peach look.To keep your eye look sophisticated, opt for rich blue shades, such as navy or teal. Darker greens, such as olive or forest, work best too.
If you want a bold peach eye look but don’t want to use contrasting shades, consider going monochromatic. Pair the peach shadow with vivid orange, tangerine, or copper shades.

, To make sure that your eyes look finished, don’t forget to pair your peach shadow with eyeliner and mascara. Traditional black liner works well with peach tones, but brown shades, such as bronze or copper, are especially flattering. Next, apply one to two coats of your favorite black mascara to help your lashes look longer and thicker.


If you prefer, you can skip eyeliner. Your eyes will have a softer, fresher look.
If you want to make your eyes look wide and bright, it’s a good idea to use an eyelash curler to curl them before you apply the mascara.

, When you’re wearing peach shades on your eyes, it’s important to add a little warmth to your skin to keep your look balanced. Use a fluffy face brush to apply matte bronzer to the highpoints of your face, including the hairline, temples, cheekbones, and jawline.If you have fair skin, be sure to choose a bronzer that doesn’t have strong orange undertones. Those types of shades tend to look muddy on light skin.
For darker skintones, look for a bronzer with earthy red undertones.

, To keep your look soft and flattering, it’s a good idea to use blush in a shade that complements your peach shadow. That doesn’t mean it has to be the exact same shade as your shadow -- opt for a peach, peachy pink, coral, or orange blush.If you want a fresh, natural look, you can go for a monochromatic look with your blush. Dust your peach eyeshadow over your cheeks to serve as your blush so the color matches exactly.

, Depending how bright or bold you went with the peach shadow on your eyes, you can opt for a peach or nude shade on the lips. If you want your eyeshadow to really stand out, peachy nude lipstick or gloss is the best option. If you went for a soft peach shade on the eyes, you can wear a bright or deep peach shade on your lips.If you want to make a bold statement with your lips, you can also use an orange lip color. It will have similar undertones to the peach shadow on your eyes, and can be judy head-turning as the usual bold red lipstick.

Use your index finger to twist the parted segment of hair a few times.,
Lay the twist against the side of your head.,
Grab a bobby pin and reach around behind your head.,
Open the split tip of your bobby pin with your fingers and place it where you want your twist to stop.,
Slide the bobby pin underneath the twist so that it is hidden by the hair.,
Clean up any stray hairs.",How to Use a Bobby Pin2," If you do not have any, you can go to any store that carries hair accessories to buy a pack. You can also buy premium bobby pins, which are touted to hold hair better than cheap bobby pins from a drugstore, for example., Use your fingers or a comb to help you part and lift the segment of hair so that it separates from the rest of your hair.


Gently push away any loose strands of hair that should not be included in the part.
Pulling back hair from along the side of your face will help keep it out of your face and keep flyaway hairs from sticking out.

, Keep the hair smooth, and if any bumps arise as you gently pull it back, smooth them out without dropping any segments of hair.


Smooth out bumps using your fingers or your comb. Do this carefully to avoid picking up any stray hairs that should not be included in the part.

, You can make the twist tight or loose; it is up to you based on how you want the twist to look.


You will need to twist the part at least five times to get a tight twist, but you will only need to twist it a couple of times to get a looser twist.

, Gently place it at the height where you want it to sit, making sure again to avoid any bumps.


It is best to lay the twist at such an angle (or height) so that the hair that stems from your hairline doesn't bump, or pouf, up when you lay it. If this happens, you will want to gently slide the twist down until the hair lays flat.
Hold the twist in place with the hand that is on the same side of your body as the twist. If your twist is on the left side of your head, then hold the twist in place with your left hand. Likewise, if the twist is on the right side of your head, then hold the twist in place with your right hand.

, Using the hand that is free, reach around behind your head to prepare to slide the bobby pin in place to hold the twist.


Aim the bobby pin so that the open side points toward your face. Make sure that the ridged arm of the bobby pin will lay against your scalp.

, You will slide the bobby pin underneath the twist, which will hide more of the bobby pin but still keep the twist held in place., Again, make sure that the ridged side of the bobby pin lays against your scalp.When you are done inserting the bobby pin, most of it should be hidden by the twist.

, Gently pat them down with your hand and/or pull them out of the bobby pin, if they got caught in it.

Gather 1-2 bobby pins.,
Pull your hair back into a ponytail.,
Secure the ponytail with an elastic hair tie.,
Lift your ponytail up so that you can reach the underside of it.,
Open the split end of one bobby pin and aim it at your ponytail, toward your head.You are preparing to insert the bobby pin into the ponytail to perk it up.

,
Slide the bobby pin into the ponytail, right at its center.,
Flip your ponytail back to normal and tighten it.",How to Use a Bobby Pin3," If you do not have any bobby pins, you can buy a pack in any drugstore; look for them in the hair accessories aisle. However, salon professionals recommend premium bobby pins, which are more expensive but hold hair more securely., You can put the ponytail at any height; this is based on your preference and the length of your hair.


Use a comb or brush to help smooth your hair as you pull it back into the ponytail.

, Avoid using hair ties with metal fasteners, as those will get caught in your hair and damage it.


Wrap the hair tie enough times to hold the ponytail securely but not so tightly that it might break your hair. About three times should do the trick.

, You can flip it over the top of your head, if your hair is long enough, or you can hold it up with one hand.


Hold the ponytail upward against the back of your head so that you can reach its underside.

,, Insert it at a slight downward angle, and push the bobby pin down until it touches your scalp.Do this gently so that you do not scratch yourself.

, Grab the ponytail and squeeze it tighter, like you would when you are securing the ponytail on your head.Grab the hair on the sides of the ponytail and pull out to the sides. This pushes the elastic hair tie closer to your scalp, tightening the ponytail.
You can also grab the top and bottom of the ponytail and pull them gently up and down, respectively, to give your ponytail more volume.

Purchase a pack of bobby pins from a local store.,
Use a comb to part a section of your hair.,
Lift the parted section of hair with your fingers.,
Pinch the parted section of hair between your index finger and thumb where you want to slide the bobby pin.,
Turn the bobby pin so that the wavy side is down.When you slide the bobby pin into your hair, the wavy side should be against your scalp.,
Place the tip of the bobby pin just below where your hair is pinched between your fingers.,
Slide the bobby pin over a very small part of the hair you want to pin.,
Place the tip so that the bobby pin stands vertically where you need it to secure your hair.,
Push the rounded end of the bobby pin the opposite direction, so that the split tip now faces down in the direction you need to pin.The rounded tip should now point over your head to the opposite side, and the split tip should point down toward your ear and shoulder.

,
Slide the bobby pin down through the section of hair you want to pin.",How to Use a Bobby Pin4," You can find them in the aisle dedicated to hair accessories, brushes, and combs. Usually, bobby pins are quite inexpensive.


Some women recommend buying higher quality bobby pins, claiming that they do a better job of holding your hair in place.If you cannot afford professional pins, try spraying your bobby pin with hairspray or texturizing your hair before using cheaper bobby pins. This gives them more ability to grip your hair., Start at your temple and slide the comb straight back along your scalp, toward the crown of your head.


A rattail comb works well for this because of its pointed tip.
You can use your index finger if you do not have a comb; however, you run the risk of not having a straight part.

, This pulls the hair up and away so that you can separate any straggling hairs from the lower area of your hair.

, Here are a couple of tips for doing this:


If you parted the section of hair on the left side of your head, pinch the hair with your left hand. This frees up your right hand to reach across to slide in the bobby pin.
Likewise, if you parted the section of hair on the right side of your head, pinch the hair with your right hand. This way, your arms are not getting crossed and tangled in front of your head.

,


Inserting the bobby pin in this way provides a better grip on your hair so that it stays in place.

, Gently wiggle the tip of the pin so that the arm of it grabs a few strands of hair., Then, lift the bobby pin and carry it over the whole section of parted hair.

, Put your finger on the rounded end of the bobby pin and wiggle it from side-to-side to help it grab your hair.,, This locks the bobby pin in place so that it will not become loose and fall out.Carefully clean up any loose strands that got caught up locking the bobby pin but are not actually secured in it.

Use cream foundation and concealer.,
Use bronzer instead of blush.,
Define your eyes with gel liner and a flat brush.,
Use soothing lipstick.,
Accentuate your healthy skin.",How to Wear Makeup when You Have Eczema2," Rather than trying harsh exfoliants on scaly patches, use a nourishing cream to repair and protect your skin.This will create a smoother, healthier surface for makeup. Avoid brands that use the ingredient bismuth oxychloride, which can be irritating.


Try companies like W3LL PEOPLE and Alima Pure.
Avène Recovery Cream and Le Roche-Posay Toleriane Teint Fluid have been recommended to give good coverage without clogging pores.

, Pat or dab your makeup onto your skin with your fingertips. Makeup brushes can hold germs that can worsen your skin, and brushing makeup over scaly patches can leave makeup caught in flakes. Use your fingertips for better control and a cleaner application.Always wash your hands first!

, Powders can get caught in flaky areas and highlight skin problems. Use cream foundation and concealer instead, which can be better blended over problem areas.Apply your moisturizer or recovery cream base first, then use your fingers to gently apply cream foundation. Follow-up with small dabs of concealer blended over problem areas.

, To cover or neutralize red patches, use a bronzer on areas that would normally catch the sun – especially your cheekbones. Blush can heighten the visual effect of redness, but bronzer will give you a sunkissed glow.


You can also try a green color-correcting concealer over red areas. Green tends to cancel out redness., Use a gel liner rather than a pencil so you don’t have to pull on your skin as much, which can cause irritation. Use a flat liner brush to push the liner into your lashes.Your eyelids are very sensitive. If you use eye shadow, choose lighter colors with a matte finish – these are less likely to be irritating.Consider using only eyeliner and mascara and avoiding eye shadow altogether.

, If possible, choose a lipstick that contains hyaluronic acid. This keeps moisture in your skin without causing irritation. Stay away from lipstick with a matte finish if you have eczema around your mouth.A gentle alternative to lipstick is natural lip balm.

, If you have eczema on only one area of your face, highlight the rest! If your problem areas are around your eyes, invest in quality lip liner and lipstick and accentuate your look with a pouty mouth. If you have dry, flaky skin on your chin, go for a more dramatic look on your eyes."

Visit your doctor for medical treatment.,
Try a medicated cream to reduce inflammation.,
Try to prevent flare-ups with calcineurin inhibitors.,
Decrease your stress level.",How to Wear Makeup when You Have Eczema3," Your skin might itch, but don’t scratch it. This can worsen your skin condition and even cause skin infections. If you can’t stop yourself from scratching, try covering the area with cool, wet compresses or wearing gloves. Take immediate measures to improve the itching – use an over-the-counter antihistamine like Benadryl, Zyrtec, or Allegra, or apply calamine lotion or 1% hydrocortisone cream to the area.For severe itching, visit your doctor for medical treatment.

, Dry indoor air can worsen flaking and itching. Get a humidifier for your bedroom to add moisture to the air.Make sure you keep your humidifier clean so it doesn’t grow mold or bacteria.

They can have some serious side effects, so are used after other options have failed.Discuss these with your doctor or dermatologist.

, Stress and anxiety can worsen flare-ups of eczema. Try yoga, meditation, deep breathing, taking a walk – anything that helps you relax. If you have a stressful lifestyle due to school or family, practice mindfulness meditation or learn stress management skills.


Talk to a friend or family member about what is stressing you. You can also confide in a school counselor, church figure, or your coach.

Draw a thick white line along the upper lid.,
Create a thinner black line beneath the white.,
Add more white to the inner corners.",How to Use White Eyeliner1," Using white eyeliner, carefully trace the lash line of the upper eyelid. This line should be very wide—up to twice as thick as normal eyeliner would be.


You can technically stop here, but the results might seem overpowering if you're not used to using white eyeliner. If you do choose to use white eyeliner as a solo liner, though, consider making this line somewhat thinner instead of opting for a super thick line.;
, Switch to black eyeliner and carefully draw a second, thin line along the lash line of the upper eyelid. This line should fall at the base of your white line, and it should be about half as thick.The contrast between the black and white liner should make your eyes stand out.
You can use other colors instead of black, but they should still be dark to achieve the same effect. Dark brown, dark gray, or navy blue eyeliners would be other options worth considering.

, Touch up the dark corners of your eyes by drawing a thin v-shape with the white eyeliner, directly around the inner corner. This line should be short, but it should overlap the inner edge of the top and bottom lash lines.


The inner corner is one of the darkest spots of the eye. Applying white eyeliner to this area can minimize this darkness and make your eyes appear more open.
Do not apply black eyeliner to the inner corner. Moreover, it's best to apply the white liner to the inner corner after you've already traced the upper lid in black since you can cover any spots accidentally darkened by the black liner.

"
Draw a v-shape along the inner corner of the eye.,
Apply white liner directly to brow bone.,
Smudge the liner.",How to Use White Eyeliner2," Using white eyeliner, trace the inner corner of your eye along the upper and lower lash line. The resulting shape should look similar to a sideways “V.”


Since the inner corner is naturally one of the darkest spots of the eye, highlighting it with white can extend the appearance of the eyeball and make your eyes seem both wider and brighter.

, Swipe the white eyeliner along the entire bottom edge of your eyebrow. Keep the line relatively thin along the inner brow, but make it wider as you approach the outer edge.


Start at the inner eyebrow, just beside the point where the eyebrow begins to arch upward. Follow the direction and shape of the brow until you reach the outer edge.
When done properly, this should highlight your brow bone and help define the shape of the eyebrow. It should also brighten the eye area overall.

, Use your fingers, a cotton swab, or a smudge stick to smudge the eyeliner at your inner eye and along the eyebrow, giving it a more subtle appearance.


When highlighting your eyes, the idea is to make them appear naturally brighter. If you don't blend the white liner into your skin around these areas, it will stand out as a cosmetic instead of looking natural.

Gently tug the lower lid.,
Trace the waterline with white eyeliner.",How to Use White Eyeliner3," Place your middle or ring finger directly beneath your eye. Gently tug down on the skin there, revealing the rim of the lower lid.


This step is especially helpful if this is the first time you've applied eyeliner to the lower waterline. If you're familiar with this practice and can see the rim of the lower lid without tugging it down, you can skip this step.

, Carefully trace over the lower waterline/rim using white eyeliner. Make sure the line of white extends from corner to corner.


Coloring the inner waterline with white liner can minimize redness, which may make you look more alert and less tired. Maximize the effect by extending the white liner into the naturally dark inner corner of your eye, as well.
Since this technique widens the eye, you may wish to avoid it if you have naturally large or predominant eyes. Apply white liner to the waterline under these circumstances could actually make your eyes seem washed out.

Color the lid with white liner.,
Dust the eyeshadow over the white.",How to Use White Eyeliner4," Use white eyeliner to color the entire eyelid. Apply the makeup as evenly as possible.The white eyeliner will have an impact on the way your eyeshadow appears. Furthermore, it should also act as a primer, allowing your eyeshadow to last longer as you go about your day.

, Pick a bright or dark color of eyeshadow. Brush the eyeshadow over the whitened portion of the eyelid, covering the area evenly with a fine dusting.


It's best to use a bright or dark eyeshadow for this. Muted colors would also work, but the effect won't be as dramatic since they inspire less contrast.
Leave the colors as they are or use a cotton swab to blend them together. The former will make the color of your eyeshadow pop, but the latter will fade the color of the eyeshadow and make it more subtle.

Mark the beginning, arch, and end points.,
Repeat along the top of the brow.,
Connect the dots.,
Pluck hairs on or outside the line.",How to Use White Eyeliner5," Use white eyeliner to mark the point where your eyebrow should begin along the bottom edge of the brow. Also mark the highest point of the arch and the point where your eyebrow should end.To determine the shape of the eyebrow:

Hold the white eyeliner stick vertically against your face, allowing it to brush against the outer edge of your nose. This is your start point.
Angle the eyeliner stick so that it hits the outer edge of your nose and crosses over the outer edge of your pupil. This is your arch point.
Angle the eyeliner stick so that it hits the outer edge of the nose and crosses over the outer edge of the eye. This is your end point.



, Using white eyeliner, mark the beginning, arch, and end points of the brow along the upper edge. These points should match up with the points marked along the lower edge.

, Draw an outline of your desired eyebrow shape by connecting the beginning, arch, and end points of your upper and lower eyebrow edges. When finished, you should have a white border around your entire eyebrow.


Make the line thick enough for you to see without difficulty. If you make any mistakes, work back over the same area with your white eyeliner to correct the shape.

, Use tweezers to pluck any eyebrow hairs that land on or outside of the white eyebrow border. Leave any hairs inside the border alone.


When finished, use makeup remover to wash away the white eyeliner.
With the white liner gone, you should be able to clearly see the newly defined shape of your eyebrow.

Apply white liner to the blemish.,
Dab concealer over the same spot.",How to Use White Eyeliner6," Draw a thin layer of white eyeliner directly on top of the blemish you wish to hide. Cover the blemish itself and any surrounding redness.


Use your fingers to blend the white liner into your skin. The area should appear much less red, but the white dot of liner will likely stand out.

, Apply concealer directly over the whitened blemish. Use your fingers to blend the concealer into the liner and into your skin.


As you blend in the concealer, both the remaining redness and the white liner should fade from view. The blemish should be even more hidden than it would be when you only use concealer.

Clean beneath the nail.,
Apply white liner beneath the tip.,
Clean away the excess.,
Buff the nail.",How to Use White Eyeliner7," Use soap and water to thoroughly clean beneath the tips of your fingernails.


If your nails seem long or jagged, it's a good idea to trim and file them into the proper shape before you begin.
Scrub the tops and sides of your fingertips around the nail bed, too. If necessary, trim and push back your cuticles to make your nails appear as neatly groomed as possible.

, Using the white eyeliner, draw a line of white directly to the underside of the nail tip. Ideally, you should color over the naturally white portion of the nail, making it look even whiter.


Waterproof pencil liners work best, but any white eyeliner will work for this trick.
Note that you must clean the applicator tip of the white eyeliner before using it on your eyes again. Otherwise, you could spread bacteria from your hands to your eyes.

, Dip a cotton swab in makeup remover, then wipe it over your hands on any area stained by excess white liner.


Soap and water will usually work, too, but the makeup remover will clean away the excess quicker and more thoroughly.

, To amplify the effect even further, use a nail buffer to make the top side of your nail smoother and shinier.


This step isn't strictly necessary, but it should give your nail a natural polish and make it look better groomed.
When done well, the entire process should result in nails that mimic the look of a French manicure.

, Once you have applied all of your makeup, makeup setting sprays or mists are great for helping your makeup stay put. Spritz your face once or twice after you have finished applying your makeup.You can also use translucent setting or pressed powders to prevent your look from fading due to humidity.

, To prevent your mascara from running, use water resistant mascara on those humid summer days and nights. Make sure to use water resistant as opposed to waterproof mascara. Waterproof mascara doesn’t hold up as well as water resistant mascara in humidity., After applying your cream, gel or liquid eyeliner, set your liner with a dark eye shadow. Use a small brush that is angled to apply the dark shadow over your liner. The shadow will lock your liner in place., Cream foundations do not hold up as well as liquid or gel foundations in humid weather. Although powder foundations hold up better than creams, they can still become streaky and dull in humid weather. Your best bet is a liquid foundation."

, Apply it from your lash line to your brow bone.

, Emphasizing these two areas gives the eyes subtle definition, and creates the illusion of wider eyes.

, Blend upwards toward the middle of the eyelid, as well as on the brow bones. This step brightens and awakens the eyes.

, Apply white eyeshadow either on an angled brush or your finger. This step helps reduce the look of bloodshot eyes, and has an instant opening effect.

, Do not line the lower lashline, as this shrinks the eye.

, When eyelashes are straight, they cast a shadow on the rest of the eye. This step, which takes less than twenty seconds, often has the biggest effects.

, Whether its two applications or seven, the creation of a dark veil of lashes is the most important step in making the eyes appear larger. With semi-shut eyes,focus on the center of the upper lashline and on the lashes at the outer corners of your eyes. A waterproof mascara on the lower lashline prevents the inevitable smudging and creasing .

, Slowly pull the comb upwards through the lashes. This step gets rid of clumps and defines the individual lashes, making it look less like you're wearing mascara.

, Arched, well-groomed brows frame the eyes, and the first time you look in the mirror after grooming them, you'll ask yourself why you never did before! Tweeze stray hairs above and below the brows, then fill in the gaps with an ashy-colored pencil or powder.

, Moisturized lips are necessary as a base for lipstick, liner, and gloss.

, Instead of applying it so it perfectly reflects the shape of your lips, level out the curve of the cupid's bow. This will help your lips appear plumper on top.

, Avoid plums and wines because just like dark clothing makes our figures look slimmer, dark lip colors will make our lips look smaller.

, For an extra ""boost"", a lip-plumping formula will plump up lips further with a refreshing tingle.

Avoid shimmery and powder blush formulas.,
Use sheer products for your eyes and lips.,
Use oil-blotting papers to remove shine.",How to Wear Makeup in Humid Weather2," While shimmery blushes can produce too much shine, powdery blushes can become streaky in humidity. Instead, opt for a blush stain or gel. Use your fingers to apply the stain or gel over the apples of your cheeks and finish with a light application of bronzer.Applying bronzer over your blush is a great way to get a natural, sun-kissed look.

, Because sheer products are light, they work great for humid summer days and nights. Use the sheer versions of your favorite eye and lip colors. Additionally, because bright lipsticks can add shine to an already shiny face, choose a more natural color for your lips when it is humid.For example, nude, subtle berry or peach lipstick shades work great.
Also, choose lip balms and stains over lip glosses and sticky, thick lipsticks.

, Inevitably, your face will become shiny and oily because of the humidity. When this happens, use blotters to remove shine and oil. Blot your T-zone and other oily areas on your face throughout the day.Blotters are great because they remove shine without removing makeup.
Try to avoid using powders to eliminate shine. Powders only add more makeup to your face, which can make your face look cakey.

Be sure to check the labels of your products for green dyes, which can irritate psoriasis.If you have very oily skin, then use an oil-absorbing primer.
For psoriasis sufferers, the use of primers is important. They create a protective barrier between your skin and other makeup products. The barrier will help reduce scaling while you wear your makeup.

, Use a yellow-tinted concealer to cover up problem areas and to further reduce the redness on your face. Dab the concealer onto the problem areas with a makeup sponge. Again, some green dyes can irritate psoriasis, so consult your product’s ingredient list before applying.A primer and a concealer may provide you with an adequate amount of coverage.

Take a selfie to check out how you look.",How to Wear Makeup Appropriately," If you are going to be somewhere there are rules and regulations about wearing makeup, ensure you know what they are. Schools and work places can sometimes have very strict rules about makeup. For example, if you work making food or complex electronic devices, there may be a no false eyelashes rule. Schools often ban all makeup, and some offices, public service roles such as the armed forces and medical profession usually have guidelines at least about your appearance and the use of cosmetics. Read the guidelines, and stick to them.;
, If you are permitted to wear makeup in your workplace, how much you feel it is appropriate to wear depends on the workplace. If you are a flight attendant, for example, the way you apply your makeup might be strictly dictated. If you work in the beauty or fashion industry, wearing makeup and looking well made up is likely to be common. It should not be compulsory.

If your colleagues all wear makeup, feel free to makeup as much as they do. If you want to, and feel comfortable doing so, it's okay for anyone to be at least as made up as the majority of their colleagues are on a normal day to day basis.






If you have a job in an industry where appearance is less at the fore, you can still take this advice, if you follow the majority of your colleagues. You can be the most or the least made up person at work; you're there to work, not look good, but if you like to put on makeup, wearing as much as the majority of your colleagues do will be deemed appropriate by most people.
You may wish to take age into consideration. If your colleagues are mostly younger or mostly older than you, you might feel like their every day makeup is too much or too little for you. That's your prerogative. A general rule of thumb is to look as made up as your average, mainstream channel TV news reader. We all know that any one of those people telling us about the current state of the economy or the latest scientific discovery may have makeup inches think on their faces, but they don't look as if they have. They don't go for obvious, statement makeup, so looking like a newsreader at work will be deemed appropriate by most.

, If you are thinking about appropriate makeup for social occasions, there are really no rules. It is not wrong for anyone to wear yellow eyeshadow and blue lipstick at a funeral if they are comfortable doing so. Other's may think it's disrespectful, but other's shouldn't judge. If you're concerned with wearing a level of makeup that others would consider appropriate for important social events like funerals or weddings, some advice may help:

For funerals, in general terms, it's back to our friends the newsreaders. Add waterproof mascara if you like and are concerned about crying. A funeral isn't the only social occasion when you might ponder how much makeup to wear, obviously. Staying with that theme though, weddings and christenings.






If you are invited to a wedding, it's bad form to try to out do the bride. Wear makeup by all means, remember there might be photos so powder to avoid shine might be a good call and anything that is especially flattering to your features and outfit will look lovely. If you are fond of spending thousands on professionally applied makeup and looking, generally, like you just stepped off a fashion shoot for Vogue Magazine, someone else's wedding day, might be a day to turn it down a notch, unless they usually have an equally high standard of appearance.
Attend a Christening looking at most like the Duchess of Cambridge did for the occasion of Princess Charlotte's christening. She looked, nice. Nice is good for christening. That being said, nothing is bad if you feel comfortable in it. Wear green mascara and blue blusher if you think that is appropriate but keep in mind others likely won't share your opinion.

, You show your date you care about your appearance and looking good for them if you are looking good and have made some effort with your appearance on a date. You can look good and of made an effort without putting on makeup obviously! Really, only you can decide how much makeup is appropriate. Be guided by what others typically wear to the venue if you wish.


Think carefully about putting on all your best and favourite makeup on a first date. You can do so if you wish, but remember if you go on a second date, possibly somewhere more elegant, you've already played your best make up card. At a date where you are just grabbing a coffee, you might choose to wear less makeup than if you went out for a three course meal at a high class restaurant.

, No amount of makeup is right or wrong (unless codes of conduct state otherwise). You can pop to the shop to get milk in a swipe of mascara and some lip gloss or fully made up in all you glory. Just remember if you wear makeup all the time, people are apt to ask stupid questions if they see you without it.

, So you have a port wine stain, freckles, scars, wrinkles, eye bags, acne, really dark skin, really pale skin, a dodgy tattoo, or some other perfectly normal point of difference from every other human being on the planet, cover it with makeup everyday, or don't. If you have some that you like to keep covered with makeup for the good of your mental health and self esteem yet are not generally permitted to wear makeup, discuss it with the rules makers. Some people need makeup likes others need hearing aids - you shouldn't be discriminated against if you need to cover something

, If you feel over made up, or under made up, change your look before you go out. Or, take additional make up or makeup remover out with you. If you get wherever you are going and feel at all uncomfortable about the amount of make up you are wearing, you can rectify the situation in a restroom.

, To start, select a light blue shadow. Use an eyeshadow brush to dust a light layer of the shadow across your eyelid. Cover the full scope of your eyelid with blue shadow. It should be light enough that you can color it in with other shadows later to create depth., Blue is not the only color you can use for frosted eye shadow. A nice white can be combined with other neutral colors (i.e., beige, grey, etc.) for a frosted look.The important thing with frosted eye makeup is that it creates a gradient from light to dark across the eye.

, Choose a slightly darker shadow next that has a small amount of glitter so it shimmers slightly. Use a thin, angled brush to apply the shimmery shade in a small line running across your upper lash line., Opt for a darker shade for your brow bone that is still in the spectrum of cool pastels. For example, go for a slightly darker blue. Use a larger, puffier brush to apply the shadow to the crease between your brow bone and eyelid. Make gentle, circular motions as you apply the shadow to your crease. Apply it across the full line of your crease for the best results., Go back to the first shadow you applied. Add another layer dusting across your eyelid, blending it out with the new colors. Then, use an angled brush to add a small line of the shadow underneath your eyebrow. This provides a highlight effect to make your eyes pop., Take a second darker tone, such as an even darker midnight blue. In your outer eyelid, dab this shade onto your lid. Make a small triangular shape with the shadow on the outer corner of your eye., Take a clean brush. Use this to gently blend all your eyeshadow together. Do not blend to the point the colors smear, but blend so each color fades into the other color. This should form a gradient, frosty effect across your eye., When you're done, use one of your lighter shades to draw a small line running along your lower lash line. Use an angled brush to draw the line as close to your lash line as possible.The color you choose is up to you, as long as it's one of your lighter shades. A darker shade will not work as well for the lower lash line.

, Keep eyeliner minimal with this look, as the attention should be on the gradient effect of your colors. Take liquid or pencil eyeliner and use it to draw a very small, thin line running across your upper lash line. Get as close to your upper lash line as possible when drawing the line.If you want, you can apply eyeliner to your waterline as well.

, You do not need a lot of mascara for this look, as the primary effect is your frosted eyeshadow. Add a single layer of mascara to your eyelashes to bring them out slightly."

Throw away foundation and concealer after a year.,
Get rid of face powder, eye shadow, and blush after two years.,
Toss lipstick and lipgloss after one to two years.,
Purge eyeliner and brow pencils after a year.,
Switch up liquid eyeliner, cream eyeliner, and mascara after three months.",How to Tell when to Toss Your Old Makeup1," Most liquid and cream foundations are water-based, which means that they’re a prime breeding ground for bacteria. Concealers have similar formulas, so they can turn just as quickly. Using old, contaminated foundation and concealer can lead to breakouts, as well as more serious skin irritations.Old foundation and concealer usually don’t perform as well either. You can wind up a streaky finish and poor coverage if your products are too old.;
, Powder products tend to have a longer shelf life than liquids and creams because they don’t provide a moist environment for bacteria and germs to grow. However, over time the small amount of water that’s in powder products evaporates, leaving them crumbly and difficult to use.If you powder products are old, you may notice that they’ve become more firmly packed in their pans, so it’s harder to pick up any color when you dip your brush into them.
Because they contain water, cream eye shadows and blushes should be tossed after 6 months to a year.

, They’re usually oil-based, which means that they also provide a good environment for bacteria to grow. Add in the fact that you’re constantly applying them to your mouth, and you definitely don’t want to hang onto your favorite lip products too long.When you use a lipstick that’s past its prime, you may notice that it doesn’t glide on as easily as it used to. That’s because it has a tendency to dry out over time.
When it comes to lip liners, you usually have up to two years before you have to throw them away. They typically have drier formulas than lipstick or glosses, so they aren’t as likely to breed bacteria.

, These products usually feature a large amount of waxes, which aren't as conducive to growing bacteria as other ingredients. However, because both are used around the eyes, you should be careful and get rid of them after 12 months to prevent irritation.If your pencils are the type that you sharpen, you can hang onto them for up to two years. That’s because every time you sharpen them, you get rid of the top layer of the pencil where bacteria is most likely to present. Just make sure to sharpen before each use, and clean your sharpener with alcohol regularly.

, Of all the makeup products that you own, mascara and liquid liner are probably the most likely to grow bacteria. That’s because the inside of their tubes provide a dark, wet environment that’s perfect for bacteria. Cream liners are always a problem because they usually come in jars that you have to dip your brush into, so they’re easy to contaminate.Mascara, liquid liners, and cream liners become noticeably dry when they’re more than a few months old.
Using old mascara, liquid liner, or cream liner can lead to a variety of eye irritations, such as redness and itchiness. In more serious cases, it may cause styes and even conjunctivitis, more commonly known as pink eye.

Pay attention to changes in smell.,
Check for changes in consistency.,
Look for changes in color.,
Consider where you store it.",How to Tell when to Toss Your Old Makeup2," When makeup products such as foundation, lipstick, and mascara go bad, you may notice that that they start to smell bad. Mascara can start to take on a gasoline-like scent, while lipstick may begin to smell like stale cooking oil. Take note of what your products smell like when you first purchase them, so you’ll be able to tell if the scent changes., The ingredients in liquid makeup products, such as foundation, may begin to separate over time. You’ll notice that the oils rise to the top of the bottle, while the pigments remain at the bottom. Products may also become thicker as they start to go bad.Moist products, such as mascara, often become drier and almost powdery when they start to turn.
Pressed powder products, including eyeshadow, face powder, and blush, may develop a film across their surface. It’s usually the result of contact with residue from the oils in your skin and other face products, such as moisturizer and sunscreen.

, It’s not uncommon for makeup items to exhibit changes in color as they get older. Your foundation and concealer may start to look a little darker, while blushes and eyeshadows may no longer appear as vibrant. If your makeup shows any changes in color, it’s time to throw it away., Certain environmental factors, such as heat and humidity, can make your makeup go bad more quickly because they encourage the growth of yeast and mold. That’s why the bathroom isn’t the best place to keep your products. Exposure to direct sunlight and extreme cold can also make makeup spoil faster.A cool, dry location, such as a linen closet or bedroom drawer, is an ideal place to store makeup if you want it to last as long as possible.

Notice the expiration date.,
Label items with date of purchase.,
Use apps to help keep track.",How to Tell when to Toss Your Old Makeup3," These days, many makeup items tell you upfront how long they’re good for. They’re usually marked with a MM/YY date that tells you when you should throw it away. If an item doesn’t have a specific date, it may have a PAO (period after opening) mark that tells you how long the product is good for once you open it.The PAO mark appears as number inside a small jar symbol. 6M, for example, would mean that a product is good for six months after the date that you open it.
Expiration dates and PAO marks are only guidelines. If you notice changes in color, consistency or scent prior to the dates on the packaging, you should still throw away the products.

, Some products may not have an expiration date or PAO mark, so it’s up to you to use the standard guidelines to know when to throw them out. It can be difficult to remember when you bought a certain tube of lipstick or blush, though, so it’s a good idea to put a label on the item with the date. That way, you’ll know precisely when you should throw it away.


Instead of labeling the makeup with the date that you bought it, figure out the date that you should get rid of it according to the general guidelines and write that on the table that you place on it.

, If you have items in your makeup drawer that don’t have expiration dates or POA marks, and you haven’t labeled them, all hope isn’t lost. There are several apps, such as Beauty Keeper, Check Fresh, and Check Cosmetic, that helps you figure out when an item was manufactured. All you have to do is input the item’s batch code, which is a number usually printed somewhere on the product."

, Eyeliner is great, but it can be tricky to apply. For this you need a steady hand, and a good sharp pencil eyeliner, or a liquid one. Be careful not to go over the top. Glitter eyeliner adds that extra little 'wow' into your face and makes you look like a partying babe.

, Use a normal black one or a coloured one. False eyelashes are also great if used correctly. Clear mascara adds definition to the eyebrows and the lashes.

, Lip paint (or lipstick) is great for a solid colour. For the extra gloss, add a clear lip gloss or sealant over the top. Sealant makes sure that the lipstick doesn't smudge. Gloss is great on it's own too, but you may have too keep applying it. Use lip liner if you want, but be careful not to change the shape of your lips, or go over the lip line.

Use clean fingertips to tub the primer and lotion together so they're combined.Using a primer will help keep your makeup in place and the lotion will keep your skin hydrated for several hours. Look for a lotion that contains minerals which can nourish your face.;
, Dab the mixture with a few clean fingertips and gently sponge it all over your face. Make sure you cover your entire face with the primer and lotion mixture since it will help the sculpting makeup go on easier.








Avoid pulling or rubbing the mixture into your skin. Rough handling of your skin can actually damage it.

, Before you begin sculpting your face, you should hide any blemishes or areas of uneven skin tone. For example, if you have dark under eye circles, use a concealer that matches your skin tone to cover and smooth out your skin tone.








You can use a concealer brush or your fingertips to dab the concealer into your skin. Use whichever one you feel more comfortable with.

, Use your favorite foundation to create a base layer of makeup across your face. Dab the foundation onto your face and then use a brush to spread completely over your face. Consider using a flat top buffer brush to spread the foundation. This will ensure even coverage across your entire face.









Avoid using a shiny foundation that might have a pearly or sparkly look. Instead, look for a matte foundation which will appear more natural., To reduce any shine from your foundation and completely blend your foundation, take a beauty sponge and dab the foundation all over your face. Ensure that the foundation is worked into the corners of your nose and all along your hairline and jawline.








If you don't have a beauty sponge, you can also use a beauty blender to dab the foundation.

, Choose a concealer that's a shade or two lighter than your foundation. Dab the concealer beneath your eyes and along your nose, forming a triangular shape. You should also spread the concealer down the center of your nose and the center of your forehead.You could also use a lighter foundation instead of a concealer to highlight key areas of your face.

, If you'd like to sculpt your cheeks, dab a little of the light concealer below your cheekbones. The concealer should be in a diagonal line that points toward your mouth. You should also dab concealer on the center of your chin.To find the best place below your cheekbones for the concealer, feel the bones of your cheeks. Gradually feel below the cheekbones until you feel a hollow space. This is where you should place the diagonal line of concealer., Dip your beauty sponge or beauty blender into warm water and squeeze it out. Take the damp sponge or blender and gently dab the concealer into the base foundation. Use the large side to blend the makeup so you don't have any sharp lines where your concealer meets foundation.








If you don't have a beauty sponge or beauty blender, you can use disposable makeup sponges although these may absorb more of your makeup than the reusable sponge or blender.

, Use a translucent powder to help set your cream or liquid foundation and concealer. This will keep your makeup in place and can control shiny or oily skin. Translucent powder is also best if you repeatedly touch up your powder or makeup throughout the day since it won't add color to your face.








If you want to bring out the highlighted areas of your face even more, dust the areas you placed the light concealer with a face powder in a lighter shade.

Use shampoo only once every 2-3 days.,
Apply conditioner every day, but only to the ends of your hair.,
Avoid touching your hair when possible.,
Use dry shampoo for a quick grease fix.,
Brush your hair once or twice a day, working from roots to tips.,
Limit styling products whenever possible.",How to Train Your Hair1," This may seem counter-intuitive since shampoo removes oils, but it actually prevents your hair from creating too much oil in the long-term. Shampoo strips all of the natural, essential oils from your roots, and your head will over-compensate by kicking into oil production overdrive.Everyone's hair is different. If your hair is naturally oily, you may want to just wash every 2 days. If this still isn't working, try washing every 3-4 days.
If, in the past, you've been washing every day, know that you'll need 1-2 weeks of transition time. Don't fear -- your hair may be extra-oily as your scalp adapts, but it will start producing less oil once you've stopped shampooing as much.
Clear shampoos tend to be lighter, with less grease.;
, In the shower, lean over and lightly squeeze out some water. Then use your fingers to lightly comb some conditioner through the tops of your hair. Leave it in for a few minutes, the longer the better, before rinsing it all out.


Hair actually soaks up water. So, by squeezing out a little bit, you allow more conditioner to penetrate the hair follicles, leading to healthier hair., Touching your hair imparts oils and dirt from your hands onto your hair, weighing it down and making it oily. Check yourself every time you feel like running a hand through your hair -- as it won't do much but make you hair oily., If you have super oily hair, spray a thin layer of dry shampoo at your roots and work it in with your fingers. This is a great quick fix that can contain some greasiness and help you get to the next wash, especially when you first start cutting down your number of washes.


You should also think about an apple cider vinegar wash -- an incredibly healthy, all natural anti-oil treatment to try once a week. Simply wash with the vinegar, let it sit 2-3 minutes, then rinse out., Regular, relaxed brushing spreads essential oils throughout your hair for healthy, even glow. Too much brushing, however, can lead to excess oil creation as your scalp reacts to the constant disturbances. Pick a time once or twice a day to lightly brush your hair for 2-3 minutes, working from the scalp down.


Only brush your hair when it is dry -- brushing when wet causes breakages.
Find your own brushing routine. Everyone is different, and people with naturally oily hair may want to brush a little less. Drier-haired individuals likely want to brush more., Gels, mousses, and creams are great for temporary looks, but over time they will build-up in your hair and make it looks flat and heavy. The build-up can also help grease and dirt stick around. When possible, style your hair naturally, saving the styling products for occasions like a party or going out.

Give yourself a time frame.,
Find out what problem areas your hair currently has.,
Moisturize your hair.,
Learn how to brush properly.,
Protect your edges.,
Trim your ends often.",How to Transition to Natural Hair1," Once you make the decision to transition, think about how long you want the process to last, or how much time you have to dedicate towards it. At first, you may think you want to transition for a year, but after three months, you may get tired of dealing with two different textures, and simply cut all your relaxed hair off.


If you want to keep both relaxed and natural hair, develop a go-to hairstyle to combine the two textures of hair.
Try a bantu knot or the twist out to more easily blend two very different textures of hair into one.;
, There are many different reasons people decide to transition back to their natural hair, and one of the biggest is because of hair damage. Once you know the state of your hair, you will know what step to take next in your journey. For example, you may need to get a major hair cut, or maybe you just need to do a deep conditioning treatment while your hair grows out.


If you aren't sure, ask a stylist or hairdresser to examine your hair. They will help lead you in the right direction.

, One of the most important things in transitioning hair is properly moisturizing it. Naturally curly hair usually requires deep moisturizing treatments to stay healthy. Start using protein treatments once or twice a month and begin using moisturizing deep conditioner treatments. Maintaining moisture will prevent breakage. Some products require you to wear the treatment for five minutes while others need thirty minutes to work. Wear the conditioners while you do chores around the house to save time.

, Detangle you hair when it is wet and slippery with a leave in conditioner and a wide-toothed comb. Start at the ends and work your way up to the roots. When you force a brush from the top to the bottom, tearing through hair knots, you are essentially pulling hair out from the roots. This is very hard on your hair and scalp.Brush your hair at night to move your natural oils out of the root area and through the hair shaft. Take finer sections while brushing to ensure that you are incorporating all of your hair.Be extra gentle where your natural texture meets your straight hair. This area is called the line of demarcation and it is the most fragile part of you hair. Take your time when you detangle and style your hair., Treat your edges with the same care as your ends because they are very delicate and will break off more easily than the rest of your hair.The edges and nape need just as much attention as your ends do. Be diligent about moisturizing and sealing the ends of your hair first. Don't neglect the edges and nape area when you apply moisturizer and conditioner, especially the area behind the helix of the ear. Fold your ear down and be sure to care for that area.


Avoid any style that puts too much tension on your temples and the nape of your neck.
Use a natural oil serum that will keep your edges smooth and protected.

, Trimming your ends regularly can help you transition to your natural hair more quickly. Trims prevent split ends from traveling far up your hair strand, causing more drastic cuts. Sometimes it can seem as if your hair isn't growing, but the problem could actually be that your ends are breaking off faster than your hair is growing, which creates the illusion of stunted hair.


Keep up with regular trims every four to six weeks to keep your hair growing longer.

Get a soft towel or t-shirt ready.,
Gently squeeze wet hair with your hands.,
Blot and squeeze your hair dry with the towel.,
Use a fresh part of the towel to keep blotting.",How to Towel Dry Hair1," When you’re towel drying your hair, it’s best to use a very soft towel or even an old t-shirt instead of a coarse, nubby towel. Using softer material will prevent your hair from getting tangled and damaged when you dry it.


When you use a soft towel, your hair cuticle lies flat, so it dries in nice, glossy waves or curls. When you use a coarse towel, it’s more likely to frizz.
You can buy special towels made just for towel drying hair. Make certain that it is made with a soft material. Check in beauty supply stores or online.;
, Right when you turn off the shower, when your hair is still dripping water, run your hands over your hair and gently squeeze out the extra water. It's easier to towel dry your hair when streams of water aren’t still running out.


Don’t twist your hair, as this can easily damage it. Very gently gather your hair into sections and squeeze out the extra water. It’s best to do this while you’re still in the shower.

, Grab a section of hair and gently blot and squeeze it with the towel, working from the roots all the wall to the tips. Keep doing this with each section until your hair is totally towel-dried. Your hair will still be damp, but no longer dripping wet.


Do not wring out your hair or squeeze it too hard. Just use the towel to gently absorb moisture.
Do not rub your hair with the towel, as this will cause frizzing. Just Gently squeeze and blot.

, Once you finish going over each section of hair with the towel, you can use a fresh towel or a dry part of the towel to go over each section once more. This step is not strictly necessarily, but it’s a way to get your hair as close to dry as possible using only a towel.


As your hair dries further, it’s more likely to tangle, so be extra careful not to rub your hair with the towel.
Once your hair is mostly dry, it’s ready to be styled.

Mix well and apply. Massage on both scalp and the entire length of your hair.
Wash your hair with a mild shampoo after 2 hours or so of the oil bath. You may want to wear a shower cap in the interim to prevent dripping., This works best for large curls or wavy hair. Get a handful of big hair clips (duck bill clips work best) and pin the hair back together. It will look silly, but letting your hair dry straight will slowly train those curls to relax. Pull as much behind your head as possible, using 3-5 clips to hold your locks straight each night after you shower., The following regimen will work for just about any curly hair type. However, you should know that the results will only last as long as your regiment does. Curly hair is going to naturally curl when left alone. But, if you don't leave it alone:


Shampoo and condition with a ""smoothing"" shampoo, found at most stores.
Blot your hair dry lightly.
Apply a small dollop of leave-in conditioner to the roots.
Detangle your hair by combing through with a wide-toothed comb.
Blow-dry your hair, brushing it lightly as you do, and aiming the heat away from your scalp.
Apply a heat-protection spray to protect your hair from the incoming heat.
Use a straightening iron to straighten out your curls., Regular heat treatment will straighten your hair, but that is because it is damaging it. Over time, you'll notice it may thin a bit, or become dry and straw-like. There is nothing wrong with this. Just know it is the trade-off for training coiled or curly hair.


Want to get your curls back? Simply start styling curls again. Cut out the heat, get a mousse or gel for curls, and use regular conditioner to get your hair back on track."

Find you hair's natural pattern to learn how your hair wants to fall.,
Get your hair cut regularly, at least every 3-6 months.,

Limit the amount of heat you expose your hair to.,
Avoid chemical treatments to your hair, which often cause more long-term harm than good.,
Eat healthy for healthy hair.,
Love the hair you've been given.",How to Train Your Hair3," Everyone's hair is a little different, and you're never going to train your hair until you stop fighting it and work with its natural pattern. Take a few days where you simply wash and condition your hair like normal, letting your hair air-dry when you're done. Don't comb through it until it has completely dried out. What does your hair do naturally? How does it want to fall? While you can adjust and play with your hair's exact look, you are going to have the best, healthiest hair if you play to it's natural strengths.Hair has different levels of curling and kinking, none of which are more attractive than others.
Training your hair is about working with what you've got, not fighting it into another pattern. While hair has some ability to adapt, your natural hair pattern will follow you for life., Healthy hair needs to be trimmed. Moreover, getting cuts is a great way to get the hairstyle you want without using dangerous and damaging chemicals. The best way to train your hair is with a stylist, who can cut and shape your locks into a look that fits your hair best. Bring in pictures of styles you like, and take the time to talk to your hairstylist about what you want. If you're at a loss, ask for a little advice -- they likely know what styles will suit you best., For optimal hair health, you should pat it dry gently with a clean t-shirt or microfiber towel instead of ruffling it dry with a towel. This creates much less friction, which can cause breakage and frizz as you hair dries. Whenever possible, pat away the excess moisture and the let your hair air dry., Heat will cause your hair follicles to open up, which lets moisture leak out and leads to dry, damaged hair. Whenever possible avoid using heat, opting instead for a natural, lovely look.


Avoid straighteners and curlers whenever possible. If you want to use them, be sure you apply a heat protectant product ahead of time.
Cooler showers or, at least, lukewarm showers, are best for hair health.
If you need to blow dry your hair, let it air-dry as much as possible, then use the blow dryer on ""cool"" for the healthiest option. Hair doesn't like heat, so avoid blasts of hot air when possible.

, Relaxants and chemical straighteners may temporarily ""train"" your hair, but it will only get more difficult to deal with over time. These products stress hairs into an unnatural pattern, weakening your hair follicle and forcing you to apply more and more product just to keep the hair healthy.If you're looking for short-term training, then a chemical treatment like a conk, straightening, etc. will give you a few weeks of straighter hair.

, You hair, in many ways, reflects the overall health of your body. Stronger, healthy hair is much easier to manage and train, so you need to be cognizant of your diet for the best hair. Make sure you're drinking plenty of water each day (6-8 glasses) and eating a balanced diet of lean protein (chicken, fish, eggs, beans), fruits, vegetables, and complex carbohydrates (oats, whole wheat, quinoa, etc.) for the best hair. Specific, hair healthy foods include:


Fatty oils, found in fish, avocados, olive oil, and nuts, are great for healthy hair. If you cannot get a lot naturally, consider a fish oil pill.
Vitamins and minerals are essential for good hair. A healthy assortment of fruits and vegetables, especially spinach, citrus, sweet potatoes, and bananas, will promote healthy hair. You should also consider a multi-vitamin., The hair you were born with is the hair you're going to live with, and that is a good thing! You natural hair pattern (the way your hair falls and curls without products) is not likely to change unless you undergo a large hormonal change. That means that your hair may change after puberty, or with pregnancy, but that's about it.You need to learn to love your natural hair pattern. While products, styling gels, and heat treatment may change your hair temporarily, you cannot ""train"" your hair to be permanently different than it is now. Instead of fighting it, learn to love it. Try out some new styles based on what you have, not what you wish you had, on your head:


Hair styles for curly hair.
Hair styles for straight hair.
Hair styles for frizzy hair.
Hair styles for thin hair.

Use the first two months to plan.,
Be patient during months three and four.,
Start a new style in month five using your new outgrowth.,
Consider cutting off your relaxed ends.,
Watch around month nine as your relaxed hair is on its last legs and your new growth flourishes.",How to Transition to Natural Hair2," These may be easy months if you had previously kept up with the general relaxer guideline of touch-ups every eight weeks. Start thinking of good transition styles for the months ahead. Take this time to practice a few styles and see if there's one or two that you want to pursue.Consider braid extensions. They are a good way to get your mind off of growth and they reduce daily styling.
Don't pick a style that requires the use of a flat iron or curling iron. The style you chose should be in preparation for when you have your natural curls.

, This is where transitions can get more challenging, as you'll need to be very attentive taking care of your hair at the line of demarcation, that area where your relaxed hair meets your new growth. This area is particularly fragile area where you'll experience the most breakage., You may have anywhere from two and three inches of new growth. The new curls you have growing in will look noticeably different than your relaxed hair. If you had a texturizer instead of a relaxer, you won't notice as much of a difference. Daily styling may be a challenge, which is why you should try styles that make the most of your curls, not fight to straighten this new growth.


Trim one to two inches of hair and continue with protein and deep conditioning treatments.

, Once you get about four inches of new growth, you may want to get rid of your processed hair. The ends of your hair may seem to be barely hanging on. The sooner you get rid of your processed ends, the sooner you can begin to understand your hair's unique texture and work with it. If your relaxed hair is shorter in length than your new growth, consider cutting the processed ends away.This can be tough for women who like their hair long, but thin and broken ends are not flattering.

, By this point, you will be more familiar with your natural texture and begin to understand how to manage it. When you cut off the rest of your relaxed hair, you'll see how your hair is unique to you and you can embrace your beautiful hair.

Be consistent with healthy habits.,
Don't wash your hair everyday.,
Stimulate your scalp with massage.,
Invest in great products.,
Limit heat styling.,
Protect your hair at night.,
Focus on nutrition and ditch processed foods that don't provide you with essential vitamins.",How to Transition to Natural Hair3," Once you have your beautiful natural hair, be kind to it. Continue to gently comb your hair, buy great products, do weekly deep conditioning treatments, and use limited heat. Even if you can't adhere to all of these changes, do as many as you can. The more consistent you are with healthy hair habits, the better results you will have.


Keep a diary. Spend some time every two weeks and write down how your hair is doing so you can watch for improvements. This will also help you figure out which products are working well for you and which ones aren't.

, Washing your hair every day strips oil from your scalp and hair leaving them both dry.Generally, curly hair does not tend to get too oily and as a result, less dirt gets attracted to the hair. This means there is no need to wash your hair everyday.You'll have to do some experimenting, but cleanse your scalp anywhere from every two days to every three weeks.
For hair under 4 inches, oily hair of any length, dandruff management, or jobs that involve a lot of a lot of physical activity or dirt, wash every two to three days.
For medium length hair that is not oily, try washing your hair every one to three weeks.

, Use your fingers tips or a soft bristled brush to gently massage your scalp. This is a good technique not only for stress relief benefits, but it also boosts circulation to the scalp and hair follicles. Better circulation leads to more oxygen which promotes hair growth.


Do this either before you wash your hair or while you are shampooing in the shower.

, Finding quality shampoos and conditioners makes a huge difference in the quality and texture of your hair. Stay away from cheap hair products. Check out the products sold where you get your hair done or ask your stylist for help on what to buy and where you can get it.


Look for natural hair products. This way you can avoid any unnecessary exposure to hair chemicals.Customize your shampoo and conditioner by using products that work with your hair type. Whether you have have frizzy, course, fine, oily, or dry hair, there are shampoos and conditioners specially designed to treat your hair type.

, There are so many gorgeous styles that can be achieved without the use of heat so keep the flat iron at the back of your shelf and use it sparingly. Forced heat applied to your hair causes the hair cells to break down and eventually break off. Your hair will look healthier and stay stronger by using more natural methods to achieve the same looks.

, Hair can become broken on your pillow and sheets as you toss and turn your head. Wrap your hair every night with a silk or satin scarf to sleep in. Another option is to use a silk or satin pillowcase. Doing this will help reduce friction against your hair which prevents split ends and damage., Hair thrives off certain vitamins found in a healthy diet. Biotin promotes healthy hair by increasing the hair’s elasticity, protecting against dryness, and producing keratin, a primary component of healthy hair. Vitamin A helps to produce healthy sebum, an oily substance secreted by the scalp, which keeps hair hydrated. Vitamin E is an antioxidant that helps neutralize free radicals. In addition, it helps the body’s blood circulation by increasing oxygen uptake, which helps the body produce new hair.For biotin, include brown rice, bulgur, green peas, lentils, oats, fruits and vegetables into your diet.
For vitamin A, add cod liver oil, krill oil, carrots, spinach, and peaches into your diet.
For vitamin E, try beans, soybeans, leafy greens, wheatgerm oil, and nuts.
Take vitamin pills to supplement any of these vitamins you may not get in your diet.

Dye your hair the same color as your roots.,
Consider a haircut.,
Stay away from anything that will dry out your hair.,
Stay away from dyes and sun-in products.",How to Transition to Natural Hair4," If you are like many people who have a processed hair color that is different than their natural one, you will need to dye your hair once more to match your new outgrowth. This will allow you to grow out your natural hair and disguise where your roots meet your processed hair.


This is a necessary step to avoid two-toned hair.
Avoid doing this yourself.
Ask your hair stylist to match a permanent hair color to your natural outgrowth so your hair will stay one shade as you are growing it out.

, If your current locks are damaged, split, or very dry, think about embracing a major haircut. Occasionally, hair can become so damaged that you will be unable to add anymore dye onto the processed hair to match it to your roots. Don't hold on to hair that looks damaged just for the sake of having longer hair.


Cutting your hair will help you transition to natural hair faster.

, Colored hair takes a toll on hair follicles. Try not to do anything that will continue to dry out your hair like using heating tools to style it or shampooing too often.


Let your hair air dry after a shower.
Do a deep conditioner treatment once a week to lock in moisture.

, Once you have your natural hair, don't go back to square one by using harsh chemicals. Even semi-permanent hair dye and toners will clog your hair follicles and damage your natural hair. Remember, sun-in products are not all natural and will cause damage.


While sun-in products will lighten your hair without the use of bleach, it is still a product that changes hair follicles. It will also create a noticeable difference in the tone of your hair when your roots start to come in a darker color.

Have a large, soft towel ready.,
Gently squeeze excess water from your hair.,
Bend over and place your towel over the back of your head.,
Bring the sides of the towel together at your forehead.,
Twist the towel.,
Keep your hair in the towel for 20 to 30 minutes.",How to Towel Dry Hair2," A towel wrap is a good system to use if you have very long hair that tends to hold onto moisture for a long time. You can wrap up your hair while you’re getting ready for the day, then take it down and style it when it’s still a little damp. You’ll need a large, soft towel long enough to wrap your hair.


You can buy special towels made just for this purpose. Check out a beauty supply store or look online for a good selection.

, Right when you turn off the shower, use your hands to gently squeeze water from your hair. Don’t wring it out, but just squeeze it lightly to remove the streams of water that will drip down. This way your hair will dry faster.

, Make sure all of your hair is hanging straight down, and use your hands to finger-comb it into place. Position the towel horizontally across the back of your head, so that the bottom of the towel is aligned with the bottom of your hairline.


Make sure all of your hair is hanging in the same direction, so it’ll get wrapped up nicely in the towel. If some of your hair is folded back in a random direction it could end up messing up your style when it dries.

, While you’re still bent over, use your hands to gather your hair into the towel so that the sides of the towel meet in the middle of your forehead. It should look as though you have a long top ponytail covered by a towel.

, Starting right next to your forehead, use your hands to twist the towel in one direction. Your hair and the two sides of the towel should all be part of the twist. When you’ve twisted the towel to the very end, put the end of the twist on top of your head.


Don’t twist too hard, since this could pull at your hair. Twist just tightly enough so that the twist stays in place.
You can hold the end of the twist in place with a hair clip.

, The towel will absorb the moisture in your hair during this time. It’s a gentle way to dry long hair. When you’re ready, remove the towel and style your slightly damp hair.

Use a wide-toothed comb to detangle.,
Add some leave-in conditioner or another product.,
Style your hair, then let it finish air drying.,
Finish with a hair dryer for special occasions.",How to Towel Dry Hair3," Never run a brush through wet or damp hair, since this could cause it to break and lead to frizzing. Instead, gently pull a wide-toothed comb through your hair, starting near the tips and working your way up to the roots.


If you have very curly or kinky hair, you may not need to comb it at all. Combing could cause the individual hairs to separate and frizz. Experiment with your hair to find out what method works best for you.

, If your hair tends to get pretty tangled, you might want to smooth in some leave-in conditioner, gel or oil to help you detangle it with the comb more easily.

, Part your hair where you like it to be parted, then style it as usually. Add hair gel, mousse or spray to create the height, volume and texture you want. Let your hair air dry completely, and you’re good to go.

, You can use a hair dryer to finish towel-dried hair, leaving it glossy and smooth. First apply a heat protectant product to protect your hair from heat as much as possible. Then dry your hair section by section, using a round brush to create a smooth, glossy finish.

Wash your hair less frequently.,
Use a cleansing conditioner instead of shampoo.,
Rinse your hair with cool water.,
Apply a leave-in conditioner.,
Brush your hair with a natural bristled brush.,
Limit heat styling.,
Use a hair oil.,
Apply a hairspray with UV protection.,
Deep condition your hair weekly.,
Use natural DIY hair masks.,
Incorporate more omega-3 fatty acids in your diet.,
Sleep with a humidifier in your bedroom.,
Get your hair trimmed regularly.",How to Treat Dry Hair," When you have dry hair, washing too often can strip the moisture from your hair, causing your locks to become even more dehydrated. If you currently wash everyday, switch to every other day. If you wash every other day, switch to every third day. Wash as infrequently as possible to keep the moisture in your hair.If your roots start to look greasy or your hair is flat in between washes, use a dry shampoo to soak up excess oil and add texture to your locks.;
, Traditional shampoos contain sulfates and other chemicals that dry out your hair. Instead of washing with shampoo, use a cleansing conditioner, which uses natural oils to cleanse and condition at the same time. They leave your hair feeling clean and moisturized.Make sure that your hair is completely saturated with water before you apply the cleansing conditioner.When you’re using a cleansing conditioner, apply it from the roots to the ends.
While a cleansing conditioner can keep your hair clean, you can still get buildup from styling products, deep conditioning treatments, and sweat. To get rid of it, use a clarifying shampoo every two to four weeks instead of the cleansing conditioner.
If you don't want to use a cleansing conditioner, opt for a sulfate-free, natural shampoo. Look for a formula that contains ingredients such as argan oil, almond oil, coconut milk, honey, aloe vera, shea butter, and other organic naturals that won't strip your hair of moisture.

, When you’re rinsing your hair after washing it, don’t use hot water. The heat can actually dry out your hair, leaving it even more brittle and dehydrated. Instead, use cool water to rinse the shampoo or cleansing conditioner from your hair.For the final rinse of your hair, it’s a good idea to use cold water. Not only does it seal the cuticle and lock the moisture in, but it leaves your hair looking shinier too.

, With a cleansing conditioner, you likely don’t need to use a traditional cleanser after each washing. However, it’s a good idea to boost the moisture in your hair by using a leave-in conditioner. Work it through your hair after you’ve towel dried it.A spray leave-in conditioner works best on fine or thin hair.
A cream or lotion leave-in conditioner works best if you have thick or curly hair.
Follow the instructions on leave-in conditioner’s bottle for the proper amount to use.

, When you have dry hair, a brush with synthetic bristles is more likely to snag your locks, leading to breakage. It can also cause static electricity that leaves your hair more brittle. Instead, opt for a brush with natural bristles, which are more gentle.A brush with boar or wooden bristles is the best bet for dry hair.

, Using heated styling tools, such as a curling iron or flat iron, can dry out your hair further. It’s best to limit your use of heat styling to once a week. Blow drying your hair can also cause moisture loss in your hair, so air dry your locks whenever possible.When you do heat style your hair, always apply a heat protectant product. It coats your hair with extra moisture so your hair doesn’t lose any of its natural moisture when it’s heated.
Use a heat protectant spray if you have fine or thin hair.
Use a heat protectant lotion or cream if you have thick or curly hair.
When you use a curling iron, flat iron, or blow dryer, use the lowest heat setting possible to achieve your desired results. Low to medium heat is the best option.

, Dry hair needs all the extra moisture it can get, so incorporating a hair oil into your styling routine is a good way to hydrate your locks. You can use on wet or dry hair to not only add moisture, but make your hair appear smoother and shiner.Argan oil is the best hair oil for dry, brittle tresses.
For wet hair, spread a small out of oil between your hands and work it through your hair for smoothness and shine.
Apply a small amount of hair oil to the ends of dry hair to get rid of frizz and camouflage the look of split ends.

, When you’ve finished styling your hair, you’ll probably want to lock it in place with a hairspray. An alcohol-free formula is the best choice for dry hair because it won’t dry out your locks. However, you should also choose a spray that offers UV-protection, so you don’t have to worry about the sun drying out your hair either.If you’re going to be out in the sun for an extended period of time or don’t want to use a spray with UV-protection, wear a wide-brimmed hat to protect your hair.

, To ensure that your dry hair gets the moisture that it needs, you should use an intensive deep conditioning treatment once a week. Apply the deep conditioner after washing your hair, and allow it to soak into your hair for 10 to 20 minutes before rinsing it off.While you’re letting the deep conditioner sit on your hair, you can boost its moisturizing power by putting a shower cap or plastic wrap over it. The extra heat will help the conditioner penetrate your hair more easily.
Choose a deep conditioner with moisturizing ingredients, such as glycerin, shea butter, olive oil, argan oil, and keratin or other proteins.

, Many ingredients that you have in your kitchen can actually help moisturize and strengthen dry hair. Mayonnaise and honey are both ideal conditioners for dry hair. Apply either to wet hair and allow it to sit for at least 20 minutes before rinsing it out with warm water.Avocado also makes an ideal mask for dry hair. Mix a mashed ripe, peeled avocado with about 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of an oil, such as olive, jojoba, or wheat-germ. Apply it to freshly washed hair, cover your head with a shower cap, and let it sit for 15 to 30 minutes before rinsing it out.
Egg yolks are also excellent for moisturizing dry hair. Apply the yolks from 5 to 6 eggs to clean, wet hair, and allow it to sit for 20 minutes. Be sure to rinse it out with cool water to keep the egg from ""cooking.""

, The foods that you eat can impact your hair. For dry hair, it helps to eat a diet that’s rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which can assist your scalp in producing more natural oils.Salmon, tuna, egg yolks, walnuts, and spinach are all high in omega-3 fatty acids.
If you aren’t a fan of foods that provide omega-3 fatty acids, talk to your doctor to see if taking an omega-3 supplement is a good option for you.

, If you live in a dry climate or the weather for the season is dry, your environment can affect your hair. Keeping a humidifier in your bedroom is a good idea because it will produce moisture that can hydrate and condition your hair while you sleep.Pay attention to the thermostat in your home too. If you have your heat turned up too high, your hair may become even more dehydrated.

, The ends of dry hair are usually the most dehydrated and brittle. To keep your hair looking its best, have your hair trimmed every four to six weeks."

Purchase a pair of thinning shears.,
Begin with clean, dry hair.,
Choose a fist-sized hank of hair to thin.,
Use the thinning shears to cut your hair down the shaft.,
Comb the thinned section of hair.,
Repeat with the rest of your hair.",How to Thin Hair1," This tool is often employed by stylists in salons. Thinning shears look like scissors with a thick, serrated edge. They are designed to cut about 15% of the hair, resulting in hair that still holds its shape and style but has less volume and density. Thinning shears are available from beauty supply stores and the hair care section of department stores.;
, When you get your hair trimmed with a regular pair of scissors, starting with wet hair allows for greater control over the style. With thinning shears, however, it's better to start with dry hair so that you can see exactly how much volume you're taking out. This prevents you from over-thinning your hair.


Shampoo your hair and dry it how you normally do. If you tend to let it air dry, do that; if you usually blow it dry, go ahead and style it that way. Your hair should be as close to its normal everyday texture as possible.
Don't add any styling products to your hair. These can clog the shears and also prevent your hair from looking as full as it normally is, throwing off your ability to gauge how much to thin out.

, It's best to thin a section at a time, and thin the same amount all around your head. Hold the first section away from your head and clip the rest back.

, Start by placing the shears about halfway up your hair shaft, just below your ears. Close the shears over your hair. Open them and move the shears about 1/2 in down the length of your hair, then close the shears again. Repeat until you reach the bottom of your hair.


If your hair tends to get full toward the tips, you can start even lower and just thin out the last few inches of your hair.
Be careful about starting too close to the roots. The thinning shears are actually cutting pieces of your hair, so if you start too high you'll end up with short pieces toward the top of your head. It's best to start thinning at the bottom of your shortest layer.

, Run a comb through a few times to remove all the cut pieces of hair. Take a look at the newly thinned section. Is it thinned out enough, or is it still too thick? If necessary, use the thinning shears to thin out the section again.

, Section by section, use the same method to thin out your hair. To make sure it looks even, try to use the shears the exact same amount on each section, rather than going over one section more times than you go over the others. Comb the cut pieces from your hair, take a step back, and admire your thinned-out look.

Select chemical-free hair products.,
Handle your hair gently.,
Stop using heat.,
Let your hair be its natural self.,
Get regular trims.",How to Thicken Your Hair1," Sometimes the main culprit that causes hair to thin is the shampoo you use every day. Hair cleansers, conditioners, and styling products often contain chemicals that wear down the hair, dry it out and cause it to fall out more easily than healthy hair. Immediately improve the health of your hair by making the following changes in your bathroom:


Swap shampoo with sulfates for sulfate-free shampoo. Sulfates are harsh cleaners that are effective at stripping away the oils in your hair. The problem is that without the protection of natural oils, hair gets easily damaged and frayed. Choose a shampoo made with oils and natural cleansers that won't be too harsh for your hair.
Replace commercially-manufactured conditioner with something made with natural ingredients. Conditioners can contain sulfates, too, and they also contain other chemicals that can be hard on your hair. Replace your conditioner with one that is made with coconut oil, aloe, and other natural conditioners. You can also try substituting an apple cider vinegar solution - it makes hair soft, supple and shiny.
Toss out hair sprays, gels, and pomades containing a lot of chemicals. Again, applying these to your hair can damage it over time. Use them sparingly or replace them with hair products containing natural ingredients.;
, Hair is soft and fragile, and if you're trying to grow it as thick as possible, it's important not to treat it too roughly. Certain hair-handling habits can cause hair to fall out, break off, or fray. Change up your routine in the following ways:









Wash it less frequently. Washing your hair every day doesn't give your scalp time to produce the natural oils that coat your hair and keep it healthy. Wash it three times a week at most. Use dry shampoo to freshen it up between washings.
Blot your hair dry. Instead of wringing it out and roughly toweling it, use a soft towel to gently squeeze your hair and blot it dry.
Use a wide-toothed comb instead of a brush. Brushing your hair can pull it out, and especially never brush your hair when it's wet. Use a wide toothed comb to work out the tangles gently.

, Styling tools like hair dryers, straightening irons, and curling irons are tough on hair. Use them sparingly or forego them altogether. If you absolutely must straighten or curl your hair, try straightening without heat or using sponge rollers to curl it.

, Bleaching, highlighting and coloring your hair can cause it to fall out or become dry and brittle. Chemical straighteners and permanent curls are also extremely damaging to your hair. Embrace your natural color and texture to promote hair growth and preserve the health of your hair.

, Trimming your hair gets rid of dull, damaged ends and adds new life and volume to your hair. Shorter cuts and layered cuts, especially, can make your hair appear to be thicker than it looks when it's long and untrimmed.

Get a long layered cut.,
Wear your hair straight.",How to Thin Hair2," If you have very full hair that tends to turn into ""triangle head"" - thick, bushy tips that rise to a point at the top of your scalp - you may want to consider getting a cut to help balance your hair's volume. Layers redistribute the volume for an overall look that is sleeker and less poofy.


Tell your stylist that your hair feels too full and heavy on the bottom, and that you'd like long layers for a thinned-out look.
Avoid getting a straight-across cut without any attention to layers. Short cuts are also harder to manage if you have thick, voluminous hair, since the hair tends to mushroom out from your scalp until it grows long enough to lie flat against your head.

, Curls, waves and frizz make hair look bigger. This is advantageous in some cases, but if you're hoping to reduce volume, a straight look might be the way to go. There are many ways to straighten your hair, both permanently and temporarily, to create a thinner look.


Blow your hair dry with a round brush. The heat causes your hair to dry straight, sleek, shiny, and thinner-looking.
Use a hair straightener. For an even flatter, thinner look, a straight iron does the trick.
Get your hair chemically straightened. If you know you're permanently ready to have thinner-looking hair, a Brazilian blowout or another chemical straightening technique might be the right choice for you. These treatments are expensive (and the chemicals are harsh on your hair and body) so you may want to do some research before diving into this method.

Wash your hair in cold water.,
Wash your hair less often.,
Use apple cider vinegar instead of conditioner.,
Use volume-reducing hair products.",How to Thin Hair3," This simple trick is an effective way to reduce volume and frizz. Washing your hair with hot water causes the hair shaft to open, resulting in a lot of frizz and extra volume. Washing it in cold water causes the hair shaft to lie flat, resulting in sleeker, shinier, less puffy-looking hair.


If you hate cold showers, go for lukewarm instead. Even the slightly reduced temperature will help your hair look thinner.
Instead of washing your whole body in cold or lukewarm water, you could also put your hair up in a shower cap during your regular shower and then wash it separately in cold water afterward.

, Washing your hair every day removes the natural oils that keep it looking sleek and healthy. Your hair ends up looking more brittle, dry, and bushy, especially if your hair is naturally curly or wavy. Try washing it every three or four days instead to give it time to balance out. Your hair will soon be tamer and a lot easier to style and manage.

, Conditioner contains agents that coat your hair and make it look thicker than it really is. To get soft, supple hair that doesn't look too thick, switch to apple cider vinegar. Sure, it may have a very unpleasant smell, but it actually makes your hair less thick. Mix half vinegar, half water in an old conditioner or spray bottle. Spray it all over your hair when you're done shampooing. Rinse it out at the end of your shower. When it dries, your hair will be soft and shiny, but not too thick looking.

, There are a variety of gels, creams, and serums on the market that are designed to straighten or tame unruly hair. Choose one that fits your hair texture. Smooth it into your hair after it's dry for a sleek, shiny look.


Some products work best if you put them in your hair before using the blow dryer to blow it out straight.
Avoid using mousse and other products that actually add volume instead of reducing it.

Eat a nutritious diet.,
Protect your hair from environmental damage.,
Relieve your stress.",How to Thicken Your Hair2," If you have a diet devoid of essential nutrients, it shows in the volume and texture of your hair. Thick, voluminous hair depends on a healthy diet filled with vitamins and minerals that cause your hair to grow strong.


Get plenty of protein. Protein makes hair thick and shiny. Make sure you're getting enough in your diet by eating a lot of fish, lean meat, nuts, and eggs.
Eat omega-3 fatty acids. These healthy fatty acids promote hair growth. Eat sardines, walnuts, avocados, and pumpkin seeds.
Eat spinach and other leafy greens to get enough vitamin C.
Take vitamins. Prenatal vitamins, especially, contain ingredients that help thicken your hair.

, Everyday activities you don't think about may be causing your hair to become brittle and thin. Take the following measures to protect your hair from outside factors:


Keep it out of the sun. Direct sunlight can damage your hair just like it can damage your skin. If you're out in the sun a lot, start wearing a hat or a scarf to keep your hair safe.
Protect it from pollution. Do you have a morning commute that involves walking near heavy traffic? Pollution from cars, buses and other automobiles can cause your hair to dry out. Consider wearing a hat when you're in areas with traffic.
Don't expose it to chlorine. Chlorine in swimming pools is a common cause of dry, damaged hair. Over time it that can cause your hair to become thinner. Wear a swim cap in the pool. When you don't wear a cap, be sure to wash out the chlorine as soon as you get out of the pool.

, Stress from work, family issues and any number of factors can take a physical toll that manifests as hair loss. Becoming aware of this problem can help you figure out how to eliminate the problem that might be causing your hair to thin.


If possible, remove the stress from your life or deal with it using healthy methods like meditation, exercise and getting plenty of sleep.
Knowing that your hair is thinning can itself become a source of stress. Ease your worry by employing new strategies to help your hair grow thick, like using natural products, skipping chemical treatments and eating a nutritious diet.

Try a hair thickening product.,
Get extensions or weaves.,
Look into getting hair transplants.",How to Thicken Your Hair3," Beauty stores sell a variety of serums, balms and other products designed to help hair grow thicker. Decide which type of product is right for you.


Growth-stimulating shampoos replace your normal shampoo with substances that are said to promote growth.
Products like Rogaine are applied to the head over the course of several sessions, after which new hair growth will hopefully appear.

, Adding volume to your hair could be as simple as going to the salon and paying for it. Extensions, weaves, and clip-ins are a natural, effective option for getting thicker hair without having to wait.

, Getting hair transplants involves having individual hair follicles surgically implanted in areas that are thinning or balding. This method is often expensive, but it can be quite effective. Research the treatment and talk with a doctor to decide whether hair transplants might be the right treatment for you.

Comb out your hair.",How to Tease Your Own Hair," Your hair is easiest to tease when it has some texture and grip to it. That’s why it’s best to tease it when it hasn’t been freshly washed because there is some oil and product buildup to help with the process. If possible, wait until the day after you’ve shampooed -- or even two days -- to tease your hair.Having oils and product build up on your tresses makes it easier for your hair to hold the shape that teasing requires.;
, You can wash your hair before you tease, but it’s important to use the right product. Use a volumizing shampoo that will add texture and body to your hair so you can tease it more easily.Be sure not to use a moisturizing shampoo. It usually contains emollients that coat your hair and give it too much slip, so it’s more difficult to tease.

, While conditioning is an important step in keeping your hair smooth and soft, it can interfere when you’re teasing your hair. Conditioner is loaded with hydrating ingredients and emollients that leave your hair extremely smooth. As a result, it doesn’t have the grip necessary for effective teasing.If you have extremely dry hair that requires extra moisture, use a conditioner -- but apply it only to the ends of your hair, which you’ll be less likely to tease.

, If you normally add styling creams, serums, or other anti-frizz products to your hair after you’ve washed it, make sure that they don’t contain silicone. Silicone coats the hair and gives it a smooth surface that doesn’t lend itself to teasing., Start the teasing process by choosing where to part your hair for the overall look that you’re going for. If you plan to brush your hair straight back, you don’t need to part it. Comb your hair into place following the part.








If you’re having trouble deciding where to part your hair, choose the area where you want to add the most volume.

, Once you’ve parted your hair, use a texturizing or teasing spray. It helps add volume to your hair without damaging it, so apply it to the areas where you plan to tease and work it through gently with your fingers.








If you don’t have a texturizing or teasing spray on hand, you can substitute dry shampoo.

, Before you tease your hair, divide it into two sections, a top layer and a bottom layer. The bottom layer is the hair that you’ll be teasing, while the top layer is the hair that you’ll brush over the teased section to hide it for a smooth, polished look.The bottom layer of hair should be larger than the top. However, make sure that there’s enough hair in the top layer to smooth over the teased sections when you’re finished.

, When you’re teasing your hair, the top layer can easily get in the way. To make the process easier, use a clip or bobby pin to separate the top layer from the bottom layer and keep it out of the way.







, Once the top layer is clipped out of the way, take a small section of hair that’s approximately ½-inch (13 mm) wide from the bottom layer. Lift the hair away from the scalp, pulling it so it’s taut.








Keep in mind that the tighter you pull the hair away from the scalp, the more friction that you’ll create. That will give you more volume when you tease.

, With the section of hair still lifted, take a long tail comb and brush the hair against the grain toward the root. Start approximately 2-inches (51 mm) from the root when you backcomb, and gradually move further away if you want even more volume.








Use short strokes when you’re backcombing your hair.
Moving the comb back and forth as you tease can add even more texture and volume.

, When you’re finished teasing a section of hair, you’ll want to lock in the volume with hairspray. Apply a firm hold hairspray to the teased hair before moving on to tease the next section.







, After you’ve finished teasing your first section, move on to the next ½-inch (13 mm) section and repeat the process. Continue backcombing and applying hairspray until you’ve finished teasing all of the hair that you want to.








Depending on the look that you’re going for, you may not need to tease the entire bottom layer of hair. Consider your finished style to determine where you need the extra volume.

, Once you’ve finished teasing your hair, remove the clip that’s holding the top section out of the way. Comb the hair smooth, and lay it back over the teased section to hide it. Style your hair as you desire.








You can pull your teased back back into a ponytail, bun, French twist, or add a headband.
You can also lightly brush out the teased sections to soften them and make the volume appear more natural

, When you’re happy with the way your hair looks, you’ll want to add more hairspray to lock the style in place. Use a flexible hold spray, though, to avoid weighing your hair down with too much product.







, When you’re ready to get your hair back to normal, use a natural bristle brush to gently brush it out before washing it. You’ll want to start brushing your hair at the ends and gradually work your way up to the roots.Don’t worry if you can’t work all of the teased sections out of your hair by brushing them. The next step will help unmat them.

, Get into the shower, and wet your hair as you normally would to wash it. However, instead of applying shampoo, saturate your hair with conditioner. Allow it to sit for 2 to 3 minutes before rinsing it out.








The conditioner will moisturize and soften your hair, so it’s slippery enough to brush out the teased sections.

, After you’ve rinsed the conditioner from your hair, use your usual shampoo to wash your hair. Follow up with a normal amount of conditioner, and rinse your hair completely. Blot your hair dry with a clean towel.








If you hair still feels at all matted or rough, apply a leave-in conditioner to help moisturize and soften it further.

, After towel drying your hair, use a wide tooth comb to detangle your hair. Be especially gentle when you’re going over the areas where you teased. Continue working until your hair is completely smooth.








Don’t use a brush on your wet hair. It can easily snag your hair and cause breakage.

Take out a style after 3 months.",How to Take Care of Natural Hair," Natural hair has unique characteristics that you should know about in order to take good care of your hair.People of African descent usually have curved hair follicles that produce very tightly curled hair, which can keep sebum (a natural moisturizer produced by your skin) from saturating all the way down the hair shaft. This can result in dry, fragile hair that is prone to frizz and breakage.
Natural hair is prone to knotting when combed. Knotting also contributes to breakage, so some professionals recommend avoiding combing altogether for this reason. Never comb natural hair when it's dry.
Natural hair often has a slower growth rate than other hair types. In addition, the highly curved hair shaft means that hair shrinks up as it dries; those with very kinky or curly hair may see up to 75% shrinkage!;
, Natural hair comes in many varieties. While many care basics remain the same regardless of hair type, understanding your hair type may help you pinpoint what care and styling routines will produce the results you want.


According to a very widely-used hair typing system by celebrity stylist Andre Walker, there are 4 basic types of hair: straight (1), wavy (2), curly (3), and kinky (4). Within these categories there are multiple subcategories, depending on your hair’s characteristics. For example, Type 4 hair is generally split into three subcategories: 4A (spiral curls), 4B (kinky curls), and 4C (coiled curls).Many haircare websites and products refer to hair types using codes based on Walker’s system, such as “3A” or “4B”. The numbers refer to the hair type, while the letters refer to the hair texture. Natural hair tends to be type 3 (curly) or type 4 (kinky). , Understanding your hair type can help you understand your hair’s care and styling needs.Type 3 hair (curly) has springy, defined curls with a lot of volume and body. The curls are often shaped like coils, loops, or corkscrews. It can be fragile or fine, and needs moisturizing conditioners and treatments.
Type 4 hair (kinky) has very tight curls with a lot of volume. The hair is heavily textured, usually wiry, and may have multiple curl patterns instead of a single dominant one. These patterns will often form a “Z” or crimped look. It it is the most fragile hair type because it has fewer cuticle layers than other hair types.Heavy-duty moisturizers and conditioners will help keep type 4 hair healthy.

, Natural hair is prone to tangling and knotting, and washing your hair while it’s tangled could damage it. Using moisturizers and a detangling comb will help remove knots, tangles, and shed hairs.Combine one part oil (coconut or olive) with three parts water in a spray bottle. Spray your hair until it is thoroughly wetted.Distribute moisturizing conditioner evenly throughout your wet hair. Many conditioners include oils and waxes that make your hair slippery, and that will make it easier to comb through without breaking.
Work through your hair with your fingers, feeling for knots and tangles. This will help you avoid snagging them with the comb later. Gently work the knots apart with your fingers.
Separate your hair into manageable sections. You can loosely twist the sections you’re not working on, or clip them up out of your way.
Use a detangling comb to work through each section from the ends up. Detangling combs have teeth that are set at least ½” apart, so they won’t get tangled in your hair as easily.

, Many shampoos contain chemicals such as ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium laureth sulfate or sodium lauryl sulfate. These create that luxurious foam when you wash your hair, but they can also cause dryness and breakage. Look for “sulfate-free” shampoos that will be kinder to your hair.There are also shampoo-free cleansing products such as “cleansing conditioners” that you can use. They don’t foam like regular shampoo, but they tend to be easier on your hair. You can find them at most drug stores and beauty supply stores.

, Natural hair is naturally dry, and washing it too frequently can actually suck moisture out of your hair. Washing once a week is usually plenty.If your hair does get more oily than you’d like, try a dry shampoo. These are sprayable, powder-based cleansers that absorb excess oil without stripping the hair follicle. Don’t overdo it, though; dry shampoos are usually removed by brushing, and brushing can also damage natural hair.

, You can make deep-conditioning masks at home. Products you have around your house, such as olive oil, avocado, honey, banana, and even mayonnaise can help strengthen and replenish your hair., Use a soft old t-shirt or a microfiber towel to squeeze excess moisture from your hair. Never rub your hair dry with a towel! This roughens the hair cuticle and causes frizz and breakage.

, Natural hair requires much more moisture than other hair types to keep it healthy. You don’t have to spend a ton of money on leave-in conditioners, though: olive oil, coconut oil, shea butter, and cocoa butter are all excellent moisturizers that you can leave in your hair after washing and conditioning., Let your hair air dry and avoid using a hair dryer, as blow drying wet natural hair means the dangerous combination of high heat and lots of pulling with a styling brush. Curling irons, hot rollers, and hair straighteners are also very hard on your hair. There are some things you can do to get your hair straighter, like heavy-duty moisturizing, but avoid heat styling whenever you can to avoid breakage.

, This may seem counterintuitive because frizz is caused by hair sucking up moisture from the environment, but hair that is already well-hydrated is less likely to frizz. Natural oils like olive oil and coconut oil are excellent frizz-fighters, although there are also many products you can buy that will help defeat frizzing.Products that contain silicone are particularly good at smoothing hair and fighting frizz. They may also cause “crunchy” hair, so experiment and see if you like the results.

, Sleeping on a smooth satin pillowcase or wrapping hair in a silk scarf before bed is not only a luxurious little bit of pampering, it will help keep your hair from tangling while you sleep.

, Products such as gels and serums can be great for getting your hair to do what you want, but too much can end up causing your hair to look greasy or “crunchy.” It’s always easier to add more than take products out!

, Roller-setting your hair can help straighten and smooth your hair with less heat than a curling iron or straightener. Use a heavy conditioner and completely detangle before using rollers.Magnetic rollers and satin-covered foam rollers will be kinder to natural hair than other types. Avoid velcro or mesh rollers at all costs, as they are prone to tangling and could break your hair.

, Protective styles such as braids, twists, and knots keep the hair secured, which cuts down on styling time and helps to take pressure off of fragile ends.There are many tutorials online that break down these styles into easy DIY steps. Good sources for styling advice include ""Curly Nikki"" and ""Naturally Curly.""


Some protective styles, such as braids, can take hours to do and are best done by a professional hairstylist. Others, such as buns and twists, can be easily done at home., You can keep all styles looking fresh by spritzing them daily with a mixture of water, leave-in conditioner, and moisturizing oils such as olive oil or coconut oil., Even protective styles such as braids and twists shouldn't be left in longer than 12 weeks. Always deep condition and seal your hair after taking out a style."

Decide whether or not a natural style is for you.,
Make sure you have the proper tools.,
If you've been relaxing your hair for a long time or your hair is exceptionally brittle, you may also want to do a hot oil treatment.,
Combine the hot oil with a bonnet type hair dryer, and cover your hair with a plastic cap before putting your head under the dryer.,
What you do next depends upon how you intend to wear your hair, and how much patience you have.,
Whichever method you decide to use, some of the key things to remember are to keep it clean and moisturized (and that doesn't mean use hair grease, but that's another story!)",How to Stop Using Relaxers," It takes a long time and a lot of patience to get all the chemicals you've put in out, but that is the best way as it will ensure that your natural hair is strong, healthy, and manageable. It doesn't happen overnight; make sure you won't change your mind on the second or third day and decide it's not for you.;
, There is nothing wrong with most of the generic shampoos and conditioners on the market, but you want to use a shampoo and conditioner that are made for thin, brittle hair; products that are made with natural ingredients such as coconut oil, shea butter, olive, jojoba, avocado, and castor oils, aloe vera, and many others. Just make sure that you read up on anything that you use in your hair; treat it the same as you treat what you put in your body. Do not use products containing mainly petroleum or mineral oil, these are made only to coat the hair and will attract dirt and dust.

, Make sure your hair is clean before using the hot oil; you want to get all the dirt and grime out before using the oil, otherwise the oil will trap it in. Either that, or when you wash it, it will all come out.

, DO NOT let the hot air blow directly on your head, this will dry out your hair and scalp and cause even more damage to your hair.

, You can:


Let it grow out two or three inches and cut the relaxer out. You will have very short hair until it grows again; you can wear it 'natural', which means it will look like a short 'bush' (which a lot of people find VERY sexy, especially with some hoop earrings!) or if you've let it grow long enough before cutting it, you can wear it in an Anita Baker look.
You can allow the relaxer to grow completely out. This method is usually best if you're planning to wear braids, extensions, or dreadlocks while the relaxer is growing out. It's very difficult to find a hairstyle that works once your natural hair has grown out several inches. This method takes a long time; the amount of time depends on how quickly your hair grows.

, and do not do a lot of hard pulling and tugging. This makes your hair weak and will cause it to break off, and it will seem like as fast as it grows it breaks off. Instead, use your fingers or wide toothed combs and picks to gently style your hair the way you want it. If you take good care of it, you will have beautiful, soft, manageable hair, without harsh chemicals.

Some buyers prefer to see an ""after"" photo of who supplied the hair to be sure the hair is genuinely from the person shown as the seller. The more the buyer is at ease, the smoother the sale, and the more money you can sell the hair for.

, Shots taken outdoors in natural light can showcase the health and texture of your hair.

No more than one tablespoon of oil is recommended.

, The pads of your fingertips massage and stimulate blood flow to your scalp.If you are using oil, then dip your fingertips into the warmed oil before placing them on your scalp. Then, massage the oil into your scalp in small circles. Use only a minimum amount of oil to avoid making your hair too greasy.

, You can part your hair into sections, and massage each section for about one minute, or you can just work your way slowly all around your head.Some methods suggest flipping your head upside down while massaging to further stimulate blood flow to the scalp. This is not a proven method, so try it with caution, especially if you have health conditions such as pregnancy or frequent dizziness.

, Wrapping your hair gives the oil time to absorb into your follicles and hair shafts, providing extra nourishing power.Allow your hair to stay wrapped, absorbing the oil, for up to two hours.


Heavy bath towels tend to cause hair breakage, so good alternatives for wrapping your hair include old cotton t-shirts or light microfiber towels.
This step is not necessary if you did not use oil while massaging your scalp.

Keep your hair untreated.,
Don't use heat to style it.,
Wash your hair with sulfate-free shampoo two to three times a week.,
Keep your body healthy.,
Grow it out to an even length.,
Don't cut your hair until you find someone to buy it.,
Decide if you want to sell it through a third party website.,
Consider selling directly to a wig company.,
Beware of scams.,
Consider donating your hair if it won't sell.,
Have your hair professionally cut if possible.,
Bundle your hair into a tight ponytail.,
Send the hair according the agreement you made.",How to Sell Your Hair," Untreated hair, known as ""virgin"" hair, fetches a much higher price than hair that has been dyed, chemically straightened or chemically permed. These processes leave hair damaged, and buyers want hair that's in pristine shape. If your hair has been treated, you can still sell it, it just won't sell for as much money as virgin hair.;
, When you've decided you want to sell your hair, stop using hair dryers, curling irons, straightening irons or any other heating tool to style your hair. Heat damages hair and causes it to break, so it will be seen has having less value than hair that has never been damaged. Let your hair be completely natural in the months leading up to the sale.


You might also want to avoid letting your hair get sun damaged. Wear a hat when you're going to spend a long time in the sun.
Pool chlorine also has a drying effect on hair.

, Sulfates dry out hair, leaving it more prone to getting brittle and breaking. Washing every day is also drying since you're rinsing away the natural oils that help your hair stay shiny and strong. Wash with an all-natural shampoo two to three times a week to keep your hair as healthy as possible.

, A healthy body will produce healthy, vibrant hair. If your body isn't very healthy, your hair may look dull as a result. In the months leading up to selling your hair, do the following to keep it looking good:


Eat plenty of protein and healthy omega-3 fats, both of which help hair look strong and shiny.
Stay hydrated so your hair doesn't look dry and dull.
Avoid smoking, since cigarette smoke can make your hair smell as well as clinging to it and making it look dull.

, You want to grow it out to at least 10 inches (25.4 cm); the longer, the better, since every extra inch fetches more money. Avoid getting layers at the hair salon, since most buyers want hair that's all the same length at the bottom. You may want to get a very slight trim every so often to keep split ends at bay, but don't cut off too much, since you'll just be losing money.

, You get better money when the hair is fresh cut. Buyers are typically looking or hair that has its natural oils. Old cut hair tends to dry out and lose its shine.

, The highest prices for hair are fetched through third-party websites. You post a picture of your hair along with descriptive details, and your information appears in a list for prospective buyers to browse. If someone wants to buy your hair, they contact you through the site, you agree on a price, and you receive payment before cutting and sending your hair.Hair that's long, well-cared for and unique in color, texture or origin fetches the highest prices. Twenty-four inches of wavy red virgin hair could fetch upward of $1,000. Twelve inches of straight blonde hair might fetch $300 or so. Third party sites have hair price calculators to help you determine how much to charge.
You'll set up an account, then follow the steps to upload a picture, the price and other details, then wait for a buyer to contact you.
If you go this route, do not cut and send your hair before you receive payment. Take a picture of the hair while it's still on your head, receive payment, then cut and send your hair. This will help prevent you from getting scammed.

, If you're looking for a quicker, easier option, look into wig companies that buy lengths of hair. You'll get paid less for your hair, but it's a surer bet that you'll be able to sell it. Search online for companies and call those with reputable sites to discuss the terms. In most cases you'll get a quote for how much they'll be able to pay. You'll then cut and send your hair, and receive payment after it has been processed.


Wig companies have specific requirements regarding how the hair should be cared for and packaged before it's sent.
In many cases they pay by length and weight. Since they cut off several inches to remove split ends, they only pay for the useable length of hair.

, Hair is a valuable commodity, and there are people ready to take advantage of women who need to sell their hair to make money. Do your research before you sell your hair. Get more than one opinion about how much it's worth before you cut it off to sell it. Most importantly, unless you have already made a deal with a reputable wig company, do not cut off your hair until you have the buyer's payment in the bank.


Fraud is a problem for both buyer and seller. Buyers may want to perform the cut or use a known salon to ensure it's real human hair and not misrepresented animal hair or cut from a wig.
PayPal is often a better choice than mailing money orders or western union because less chance of any disputes for money ""claimed"" to have been sent. It's also highly recommended to send it with a tracking code so that the buyer can follow the package.

, Not all hair is sellable, unfortunately. Some textures and colors are less desirable to buyers hoping to make expensive wigs and extensions. However, there are companies who would happily take your hair if you've already cut it off and wish to donate it.


Wigs for Kids, Children With Hair Loss, Pantene Beautiful Length and Locks of Love are well-known organizations that uses donated hair to make wigs for people in need.

, Tell the stylist you're donating your hair and that you want it cut as evenly as possible. Give very specific instructions, and don't let the stylist add layers or texture until after the hair has been cut.Your hair needs to be completely dry, so don't have it washed before cutting it off.
Don't use products or heat tools on the hair before cutting.

, Don't use holders with metal or rubber bands because these will break hair strand. Bundle it right at the nape of your neck, where you'll be able to cut your hair as short as you can and still keep it all the same length. The stylist should cut your hair just below the ponytail holder.


Use a few ponytail holders to secure the ponytail or braid at a few points down its length, so that it does not come loose.
Transfer the hair directly to a strong plastic zipper bag to protect it before sending.

, Package it in a tightly-sealed container so it doesn't get wet or dirty, and send it off to the buyer. Make sure to send it with a tracking code so that the buyer can follow the package.

Look at your child’s scalp. Suspect ringworm if they have round or oval patches of hair loss with some broken off hairs visible just above the skin of their scalp.Hairs can look like little black dots on the scalp.


Other indications of ringworm are gray flakes or scales on the scalp.
The child may also have ringworm on other parts of their body. Look for a small, red ring with a clear, flaky center.;
, Touch the bald spots with your fingers. Notice if they are completely smooth. Look for broken hairs or small black spots on the scalp that indicate hair follicles are still present. 1 in 1,000 children experience alopecia areata – complete balding with total hair loss in round or oval patches. This may be due to an immune response, and can happen overnight., Some causes of hair loss are gradual, while other times hair loss can occur over several days or even overnight.Keep track of information about your child’s hair loss so you can tell your doctor. Keep a log with the following information:


When the hair loss started
If any new product was used before the hair loss, or whether the child was exposed to any chemicals
If the child suffered any injury or if they constantly pull on their hair
Where the hair loss started, and whether it spread
If their skin is flaky, smooth, red, bruised, etc. on the bald spots

, A physically or emotionally traumatic event can interrupt the natural growth process of a child’s hair and cause total or partial hair loss. Even taking some medications can affect the body in this way. This is a disorder called telogen effluvium. Hair loss can occur 6-16 weeks after the traumatic event. Think back to 1-4 months ago, and note whether your child experienced any of the following:


High fever
Surgery during which general anesthesia was used
Severe emotional distress, such as with death of a loved one or abuse
Severe physical injury
Use of the medication Accutane for acne

, If your child is experiencing hair loss, keep a close eye on their behaviors. Notice if your child is pulling at their hair, twirling it, twisting it, and fidgeting with it. If so, make note of whether they do this more when they're nervous or uncomfortable. Some children express stress and anxiety by playing with their hair, which can cause damage and hair loss.

, Get pediatric hair loss diagnosed by your doctor so it can be accurately treated. There are several tests the doctor can do to determine the cause of the problem. They will check for ringworm with a Wood’s lamp – a UV lamp that shows fungus on the skin.Other problems can be diagnosed with a physical exam, history, and possibly a blood test.

, Rarely, problems with your child’s thyroid or pituitary can cause hair loss. Your doctor can check this with a physical exam and simple blood test. If no other cause for the hair loss is found, ask about getting these tests done.Hormone balances such as these can usually be corrected with medication.

, Ringworm is treatable, but takes a while to go away completely. Depending on how severe the infection is, your child may have to both take an oral medication daily and use an antifungal shampoo (selenium sulfide or ketoconzaole) 2-3 times a week.Use the shampoo as indicated on the bottle or as directed by your doctor.


If your child uses the shampoo and takes their medication properly, they shouldn’t be contagious. There’s no need to keep them out of school.
It is very important to use both treatment methods for the full 8 weeks! Otherwise it’s likely the ringworm will return and you’ll have to start treatment from the beginning.

, Ask your doctor about corticosteroid ointments or creams applied to the bald areas for younger children. Teenagers may try steroid injections in the scalp if they can tolerate it. Minoxidil (Rogaine) or Anthralin may also be used. If treatments are successful, hair growth may come back in 8-12 weeks , Dermatologists are doctors who specialize in caring for skin. If your child has alopecia areata, work closely with a dermatologist. Your child may get all their hair back within a year, with proper treatment. There is no specific medication to treat alopecia areata, but your doctor can prescribe some medicines to help promote hair growth. Talk to your doctor about your child’s health and medical history so you can choose the best medication., Stress and anxiety can cause hair loss, even in children.Work with a behavioral health professional who specializes in pediatric care if your child has a diagnosed anxiety disorder such as generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, panic disorder, social phobia, or OCD.Help your child cope with general stress by trying some of the following:Listen to your child’s concerns and fears.
Provide caring, positive responses that acknowledge their feelings, such as, “I understand why that made you feel scared, but it’s okay now.”
Help them brainstorm ideas to solve the problem – teach them how to problem-solve rather than trying to fix everything for them.
Do positive, fun, distracting activities with them like reading, playing outside, and providing warm physical contact.

, If your child is constantly pulling on their hair or pulling their hair out, they may have a disorder called trichotillomania. The child may also eat the hair they pull out. This is a habit similar to but not the same as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) that causes the child to pluck or twirl their hair. Trichotillomania is more common in those with OCD, but not necessarily related.Consult a behavioral therapist like a counselor, psychiatrist, or psychologist if you notice these symptoms. They can use talk therapy and behavioral modifications to help ease your child’s symptoms.


Hair will usually re-grow normally once the child stops pulling on it.

, A sudden stress, such as a high fever, the death of a loved one, surgery under general anesthesia, severe injury or after the use of certain medications, can cause the hair growth cycle to shift, which results in unusual thinning or shedding of the hair. After the stress stops, a full recovery of hair growth can be expected within 6 months to a year.If hair shedding persists, more medical attention will be needed to see if it is related to other disorders.Try to recognize the stress trigger so you can avoid it in the future. There are many more possible triggers than just those mentioned above., Iron deficiency may worsen or cause pediatric hair loss. If no other causes for your child’s hair loss are found, ask your doctor to check your child’s iron level. If they are low in iron, include iron rich foods in their diet. Your doctor may also recommend an iron supplement – use them only as directed, as too much iron can be harmful to children.Iron-rich foods include red meat, pork, poultry, seafood, beans, dark leafy greens like spinach, dried fruit like raisins and apricots, peas, and iron-fortified grains., Low zinc may worsen hair problems in children.Include foods that are high in zinc in your child’s diet if your doctor tells you they have a zinc deficiency. Lean meats, seafood like oysters and herring, peas, and beans are excellent sources of zinc., Hair loss can be due to trauma to the hair follicle, including constant pulling on the hair by tight ponytails, braids, and barrettes. Keep the child’s hair in very loose braids, or down completely.A headband can help keep long hair out of your child’s face.
Avoid excessive washing, fluffing, curling, blow drying, straightening, teasing or vigorous combing or brushing of your child’s hair.

, If your child constantly rubs their head against a headboard, wheelchair, or other object, the friction can damage hair and cause hair loss.Pay attention to the area of hair loss and your child’s activities – notice if the balding area is frequently rubbing against something. Then take action to prevent this continual friction.

, If your child has started losing their hair, treat it more gently to minimize further hair loss. Wash it less frequently than usual and use mild shampoo for sensitive skin or baby shampoo. Stop teens from using color treatment or highlights, which can further damage fragile hair. Let hair dry naturally rather than using harsh blow dryers or curling irons., If your child is undergoing chemotherapy or radiation to the head, they may lose their hair. This may not bother younger children, whereas it can feel very distressing for older children and teenagers. Not all cancer treatment causes hair loss. Discuss the possibility with your child’s care team, and have a preemptive conversation with your child about it. It may help your child cope with hair loss if they feel prepared and know that it’s coming.


Try to focus on the positive aspects of their treatment, like the idea of getting better. Remind them that hair grows back, and that they are beautiful no matter what.

, Your child may want to get a wig that closely matches how their hair looks before it falls out. If it’s likely that your child will experience hair loss, take photos of their favorite hair cut. Cut a small lock of their hair and save it to best match color later., One stressful aspect of hair loss is the feeling of losing control. Help your child take control of the situation by suggesting they choose a short haircut that they like.Choosing to shave their head or cut their hair short can help them feel more in control, and can ease the stress of hair loss. It will also make the visual changes of hair loss look less dramatic.

You may already possess a foundation that closely matches your skin tone overall. If not, purchase one that is the closest possible match to your complexion. For beginners it is better to use powder foundation as cream can be more difficult to work with.


Choose one product 2-3 shades darker than your regular foundation.
Purchase a foundation that is 2-3 shades lighter than your skin tone.
If you just want to experiment at home, try matte brown eyeshadow in a few different shades.;
, Angled brushes that are small with firm bristles allow for greater control. A makeup sponge or a softer brush can help with blending. Often these can be purchased in small kits, or you may already have these to hand.


If you have used the brushes before, clean them with soap and water and allow them to dry fully before using them. Doing this will help you to avoid applying old makeup or introducing bacteria to your skin., Wash your face carefully to remove oils, dirt or old makeup. Gently apply the foundation that closely matches your skin tone over your whole face. If you only put makeup on your nose it will be noticeable.









Follow any other parts of your beauty routine that you do prior to applying foundation, such as putting concealer on blemishes.

, Using the angled brush, draw a line of darker powder down each side of the nose. For noses that are wide near the top, continue the line until it blends with the tip of your eyebrows.









Blow excess powder off the brush before using and apply a light amount of product. It will be easier to add more if necessary, but removing excess makeup can smudge your face or cause redness.Blend the darker powder so the line looks less prominent.

, Use the darker shade of foundation over your nostrils near the bottom of your nose to create the illusion of shadow. Remember that subtlety is is key.








, If the end of your nose is large or round, connect the two side stripes of dark foundation with an arrow shape. The tip of the arrow should be at the bottom center of the end of your nose.








, Use a fresh brush or carefully remove makeup from the first one. Using the lighter product, draw a straight line down the center of your nose. 







, Using a sponge or brush carefully dab your nose to blend the lines of makeup. Note that you do not want to blur or spread the two colors out of place. The goal is to have the makeup look like natural shadows rather than distinctive lines.









Ask a friend to tell you if your makeup looks obvious or if you have blended it successfully.

, The shine of oil is reflective under bright lights or when a camera flashes, making the nose seem larger than it actually is. One way to treat this is to use special facial cleansers that are designed to reduce shine. Be careful not to over-wash your face as stripping the oils can lead your body to produce still more.









Use finishing powder and reapply throughout the day to reduce shine.
Blotting paper, which can be found in most supermarkets or drug stores, absorbs oil. Dab your face with these small tissues throughout the day to remove excess oil., The eyes are often the first thing people will notice about you, particularly if you accentuate them carefully. If you are a beginner at using makeup, start by choosing eyeshadow that is close to your skin tone or that is the same color range as your eyes. Begin with a natural look and gradually experiment with edgier styles to see what is flattering and helps you to feel confident. Mascara is also a good product to start with for beginners.









Use liner to create a cat eye or to add the illusion of longer lashes.
Keep your makeup appropriate to the occasion. Smokey or sparkling styles may be beautiful for an evening out but look strange or out of place in the office.
Shape your eyebrows to frame your face in a flattering way, neither too thick nor too thin.

, Experiment with different lip colors and glosses. This gives you control over which of your features is most dramatic and eye-catching if you are self-conscious about your nose. Avoid lip-liner as this may look too harsh and make your other features seem correspondingly prominent.









Be careful using both bold lip color and dramatic eye shadow at the same time. It can work and be beautiful, but in some cases you simply look like you wear too much makeup. Ask a friend whose look you admire to be honest with you about your appearance.

, Parting your hair on the side, whether you are a woman or a man, can draw attention away from the center of your face and minimize a large nose. Sweep your bangs to the side rather than adopting a blunt style that covers your eyes and draws attention to your nose. A hairdresser can help you decide on long-term styling solutions.Pixie cuts and other short styles tend to accentuate your facial features.
Longer hair offers more options for styling. Layers will provide body that that will draw attention away from your nose., Use rollers or a curling iron to add soft curls that will balance distinctive features. Volumizing products like shampoos or mousse can add lift from your scalp. If your hair is naturally curly or wavy, embrace it and avoid straightening or pulling it back into a severe style.


Blowdry your hair upside-down, focusing particularly on the roots to add lift.Be cautious about teasing or back-combing your hair. This can cause damage or be difficult to untangle later.

, Glasses may draw attention to your nose, particularly if the frames are bold, oversized, or distinctive. Consider contact lenses or choose a more subtle frame. Adding scarves or jewelry to your ensemble may also help you to feel confident and that your overall look balances out distinctive features. .

Try to find a sulfate-free shampoo. Sulfate is a detergent that is great at cleaning hair, but it can also strip your hair of the natural moisture it needs to remain frizz-free. If your hair is dry, sulfate in your shampoo may be the culprit.Don’t wash your hair every day. Wash your hair every other day, or only a couple times a week if you can get away with it. Even sulfate-free shampoos can be drying, so give your hair a rest and let it soak in your natural oils. Anything that removes dirt and grime from your hair is probably also removing its moisture, so use sparingly!Using dry shampoo between washes is a great way to keep your hair looking fresh without the damage of daily shampooing.;
, Unlike shampoo, conditioner is moisturizing and will help tame your locks. Look for conditioners that are specifically marketed as moisturizing, especially those that contain glycerin. On days when you are skipping the shampoo, you can still use conditioner without worrying about damage. It will gently clean your hair, but also hydrate it. If you have the time, let the conditioner sit on your hair for a couple minutes so it fully soaks into the shaft.Choose a conditioner tailored for your hair type. If your hair tends to be oily and limp, avoid conditioners that boast qualities like ""moisturizing"" or ""hydrating,"" because these will only exacerbate the oiliness and limpness. Shampoos with added protein tend to work well for oily hair, as well as conditioners meant for ""volumizing,"" balancing,"" and ""strengthening."" If your hair is extremely oily, you may want to skip conditioner all together, or apply it before shampooing.If your hair is dry, damaged, and prone to break, look for moisturizing conditioners. You may want to also try conditioners that specifically repair hair after damage. Avoid conditioners that are described as ""strengthening"" or ""volumizing.""If you are worried about your hair looking limp and flat, avoid your roots and only apply it to the ends of your hair.

, By soaking your hair in a deep conditioner or oil overnight, you give it extra time to take in all the moisture. This may be especially helpful for African American and Latina hair that may be more coarse and dry, but it can benefit anyone who needs the extra moisture. Comb the product through dry or wet hair and then wrap it in a silk scarf before bed. The silk is key, as it will keep hair from breaking from tossing and turning.Speaking of silk, invest in some silk pillowcases! Cotton pillowcases can absorb moisture from your hair, causing it to dry out and frizz., There are a lot of ways to give your hair a boost of moisture, such as doing a weekly hair mask. You can buy moisturizing hair masks from the drugstore or spend a little more on a product from a salon. Again, look for one that contains glycerin, which will hydrate the hair shaft from the inside.You can also skip the store and make your own hair mask at home. Coconut oil is a perfect, one ingredient moisturizer. Eggs, milk, and honey also have nourishing, restorative properties., Blow dryers can be extremely drying, which will just cause more frizz. If you don’t have the time to let your hair air dry completely, just let it dry as much as you possibly can before turning on the dryer.You can soak up excess water by gently pressing your hair with a soft, microfiber towel. Avoid the urge to twist your hair up with a coarse bath towel, because it will rough up the hair shaft, causing kinks and even damage., Obviously a heat protectant is critical if you are planning on using a dryer, straightener, or curler on your hair. Heat protectants create a barrier over your hair, minimizing the damage that hot tools can do to your strands. Serums and oils also protect your hair, sealing the shaft to guard it from heat, humidity, and other environmental factors. They help to smooth the shaft of the hair, making it look more sleek and shiny as it dries.


Products containing Moroccan oil or argan oil are your best bets in fighting frizz. They instantaneously give your hair shine while smoothing frizz, but also work to prevent damage throughout the day.Apply a small amount of product evenly throughout your hair, distributing it with a wide tooth comb or your fingers.

, While very thick, coarse hair may be fine with a higher heat setting, a low heat setting will be most gentle to all hair types. Wait until your hair is damp, not wet, before using your blowdryer. For African American hair, it is recommended to wait until your hair is completely or almost dry to the touch before blowing it out, as it is typically drier and more vulnerable to damage.Avoid metal brushes when you are blow drying, because the metal will heat up, causing your hair to get even hotter (and dryer) in the process.Ionic blow dryers may be a good investment for people wanting to fight the frizz. Ionic dryers emit negative ions that help to break down the water molecules more quickly than regular blow dryers. This helps hair dry faster, thus preventing unnecessary heat damage.Many blow dryers come with a cold setting. When your hair is almost completely dry, it may be helpful to do a run-through with cold air to prevent heat damage and seal the hair shaft, helping to prevent frizz from drying.

, This technique works for both naturally straight hair, or curly and wavy hair that you want to straighten with your dryer. It isn't necessary to use any sort of nozzle on your dryer. The key is to hold your dryer at a downward angle so that the shaft of the hair is smoothed down, helping your straight hair look sleek and shiny.Start at the roots and move to the ends, using the round brush to keep your hair pulled taut. When you reach the ends of your hair, slightly roll the round brush in towards your face to prevent your straight hair from flipping out., Diffusers attach to the hair dryer and disperse heat over a larger section of hair in order to prevent frizz. It's crucial to use for curly hair, because it dries it without messing up its natural wave pattern.Set your dryer to a low heat setting, and hold the diffuser near your roots. Move it all over your head until all your roots are dry. Avoid drying your ends, and they are more prone to frizz and should be left to dry naturally.Look for a diffuser that is concave in the middle, so the curls can rest inside it and dry in their natural shape.

, While the hot air from a blow dryer can increase the frizz, heat from these hot tools will work to your advantage. Both curling irons and flat irons seal the cuticle shut, helping to make it impenetrable to outside factors that can cause your hair to swell and frizz. They help smooth and shape your hair, so you can create the frizz-free style you want. However, you must use another heat protectant before using hot tools, because they can be damaging in the long run.


Use these tools to enhance the natural shape that your hair has dried in. This will simply give your style some ""staying power.""
Curly hair should not be brushed or combed after it dries. This will brush out their natural curl pattern, causing frizz., This will help keep your hair looking shiny and smooth. A finishing spray can also help camouflage any areas that are particularly dry or damaged. You can run a brush through straight hair to distribute the product thoroughly and evenly. Brushing your hair also helps to distribute your natural oils, which help to prevent flyaways and frizz., Look for products containing polyquaterniums, which condition and protect dry and coarse hair. These are very effective in helping your hair stay frizz-free in humid conditions. While polyquaternium may make your hair feel hard and unnatural, you can loosen it up by applying a serum afterwards. Put a dollop of the product in your palms and run your hands through your hair repeatedly until your hair feels softer and more natural.For extra hold, apply a hairspray as well. Be careful not to run your hands through your hair after applying, however, because it will cause frizz and breakage.

, Longer hair can be pulled away from the face in top knots, braids, and ponytails. If you have short hair, you can play around with headbands and bobby pins to contain the frizz. Despite using the most moisturizing conditioner and prepping with serums, oils, creams, and sprays, sometimes the frizz is inevitable. When it's extremely humid, you may want to try rocking an up-do or another style that keeps your hair out of your face. Play around with different styles! Long hair looks great in side braids, while a short pixie cut can be pulled into sweet little pigtails. Hair accessories (and hats) can be your very best friend on those days when your hair just isn't cooperating.


If you are unsure how to create a certain hairstyle, YouTube can be extremely useful. You can find hair tutorials that will walk you through a style step-by-step.

, For men struggling with frizzy hair, you may not have the option to utilize hair accessories and up-dos. Choose a product that is specifically marketed for short hair. Apply it to your hair, and then comb your hair into the desired style. You may want to add more on particularly hot and humid days."

Be prepared for the huge change the makeover will have on your appearance.,
Look in the mirror.,
Cut your hair if you feel comfortable doing so, but be careful if you do.,
Dye your hair, if you feel comfortable doing so.,
Be makeup savvy.,
Go through your closet.,
Be proud of yourself.",How to Prepare for a Makeover," Before you make any drastic changes, try changing your clothes or hair. Don't jump into anything you think you will regret.;
, List some pros and cons of your current appearance. Compare it to what you want to look like after the makeover. Would you be better off leaving it as is?

, You don't want to cut too much or too little. If you aren't going to a professional hair stylist, make sure you know exactly what you want before taking out the scissors.


Choose how short you want to cut it. If you have long hair and want short hair, consider donating it. Also, remember that if you cut it, you'll have to wait a while for it to grow back. Think everything through first!
If you want to try out extensions or dye your hair, think about the cost and how hard it will be to do at home. If you don't know what you are doing, ask someone with experience.
If you are cutting your hair, choose the style you want beforehand. If you are trimming it or losing 4 inches (10.2 cm) or under, cut the sides first. Then carefully measure out the back and trim. If you are cutting 4 inches (10.2 cm) or more, use a rubber band to divide your hair into 3-4 sections. Make sure they are all even. After that, carefully cut each one at the rubber band. Shake your hair out, and use a comb to trim the ends.
For a fringe, make a tiny ponytail in front of your face. Cut it off at your nose (be careful not to cut yourself). Comb the hair across your face, and shape it with scissors. Don't cut a fringe when your hair is wet--it will dry and appear shorter!
Don't freak out if the style is a lot different than what you are used to. Normally, the point of a makeover is to change your self image. Be proud to show your true colors!

, If you decide to dye your hair, choose a color that looks good with your skin color and/or eye color. If you have a dark skin color, don't choose beach blonde if you want it to look somewhat natural. (But if you want to stand out and look flashy, go for it!) Hair dye aisles of stores often have mirrors, so hold your preferred color up to your skin to see if they look nice together. Also, compare it to your current hair color. If it is the complete opposite, the color may not look good on you. However, don't be afraid of trying new things, just be cautious.


Once you have picked out a color, follow the directions on the box. Remember that the dye will fade eventually and your hair will start to return to your natural color, so make sure you have some extra dye handy to cover up roots that are standing out after a few weeks.

, If you choose to wear makeup, choose a good color scheme. Don't jump around from oranges and reds to blues and greens. Choose colors that go together.


Apply in moderation. You don't want to look like you rolled around in makeup. If this is your first time using makeup, start small. You don't want to have too drastic of a change until you're used to it.
Ask a friend for their opinion on your makeup. Something that looks great to you may not look great to others.

, While doing so, think about what image you want to show. Put aside clothes that remind you of your previous look for now. This is a chance to go through your clothes and decide what is really you and what isn't.


If you are going for a bright, flashy look, choose clothes that match your lively personality. Avoid dark colors and aim for the colors of the rainbow!
If you are a shy person who tries to stay away from big crowds, choose clothes that are lighter in color and somewhat blend in. Don't wear glittery clothes or clothes that show off a lot of your body.
Remember, be who you want to be! Don't feel like you have to fit into one particular theme. You can bounce back and forth everyday if you want to!

, When you finish your makeover, stand tall. You are showing off the new you! Don't appear bashful of your new look, otherwise people will think that you don't like it. Congratulations on finishing your self makeover!

Simply changing one's hair color goes a long way in making a person less recognizable, but if you aren't willing to dye or get highlights, a new haircut works too. Bushy or shaggy haircuts and bangs/fringe have the added benefit of obscuring more of your face. Try styling your hair differently: if you have long hair that you usually leave down, put it in various updos.;
, Do it differently.


If you don't usually wear eye makeup, use some eyeshadow and liner to obtain a smoky eye look. Similarly, if you do wear makeup regularly, cut it back to moisturizer and chapstick. Change your lipstick shade (e.g., from light pinks to red; from dark shades to a sheer gloss). Start or stop using blush.
If you typically remain clean shaven, try growing your facial hair out (These can make a huge difference in your appearance). If you typically style your facial hair, try going for a full beard; if you let your mane run wild, try a more controlled look (Restrict your beard to stubble or a chinstrap, perhaps).
Eyebrows also can have a huge effect on what you look like. If yours are neatly groomed and shaped, let them grow out for a bit. If you let them go, try plucking a bit at them. Bleaching or penciling them are other options for modification.

, Often, each person dresses uniquely and this is a way to tell people apart. If you mindlessly throw clothes on and don't pay much attention to style or fashion, this would be a good time to start.


People tend to have distinct approaches to light outerwear, which contributes significantly to a look. Zip-up jackets, hoodies, sporty windbreakers, (cropped, full, loose, or snug) cardigans, wraps, pullover sweaters, flannel, plaid shirts worn as a top layer over tees--all of these result in very different looks.
If you normally dress down in light, distressed jeans or sweatpants and sweatshirts, printed tees or crop tops/tank tops, take the formality up a notch with darker jeans and less casual looking tops. Perhaps this means polos or dress shirts, perhaps it means blouses with some sort of frills or camis under blazers; this varies, depending on gender, regional trends, and what looks good to you. Similarly, if you usually try to look put together, try a hoodie, old jeans, and a quick ponytail (if female).
Vary your fit. If you dress in slim-fitting, snug clothes, try some flowy or loose styles, and vice versa. Throwing a baggy button-up sweater over tight outfits is a good way to change a fit.

, This includes jewelry. To alternate styles, wear no jewelry, dangling jewelry, jewelry of different colors and stones, etc. If you default to sneakers, try some non-athletic slip-ons or flats. If you usually wear sandals, get some more formal-looking closed toe shoes. Try to incorporate less ubiquitous styles of footwear, such as boots or heels, into your look, unless you already vary your style; in that case, cut it back to casual trainers.

Use cold to reduce puffiness.,
Add eye drops.,
Try a dark or nude eyeliner.,
Use a bright eye shadow on the inner eye.,
Choose waterproof versions of your makeup.,
Use disposable mascara wands.",How to Look Your Best when Dealing with Allergies1," Allergies can give you puffy eyes, but cold can help reduce that puffiness. For instance, try keeping a gel-filled eye mask in your fridge. Put it on your eyes for about 10 minutes on the mornings when they're puffy. If you don't have a mask, use what you have, even slices of cool cucumber or ice wrapped in a washcloth., If your eyes are red and itchy, consider applying some eye drops to help reduce the problem. You can use eye drops just meant for redness, or you can use ones that have antihistamine in them, meant to help combat your allergies. You'll find both in any pharmacy., Using a dark eyeliner can make your eyes seem brighter. Navy is a particularly good choice. Another option is to cancel out the redness by using an eyeliner that matches your skin tone., Another way to brighten your eyes (and diminish redness) is to use a bright eye shadow on just your inner eye. It can make that part pop, diminishing the appearance of redness in your eye., When buying mascara and eyeliner, pick waterproof versions of these makeups. Otherwise, if you have itchy, watery eyes, the makeup may run. Using waterproof versions will keep it in place, helping you look your best., Because allergens can attach themselves to almost anything, try using mascara wands that you can throw away. That way, you're not reintroducing allergens to your eyes each time you put on mascara."

Break up your body with layers and colors.,
Wear cuffed pants.,
Put on horizontal stripes and multiple colors.,
Wear a wide belt over dresses.,
Try capri pants, short skirts, and boot cut pants.,
Use long tops.,
Carry a giant bag.",How to Look Shorter if You're Tall1," Anything that you can do to break your body into sections rather than emphasizing the length with one long garment will help you seem shorter. You can do this by wearing different colors, patterns, and layers of clothing.


For example, you could wear a pink top with pair of jeans and white shoes. You could even add a cardigan or a belt to add another layer. Adding a belt with an interesting buckle or some shoes with some eye catching details may also help to make you seem shorter.Or, you could layer two tops of different colors and lengths. The different colors and layers will help to break up your body and make you seem shorter.;
, Wearing pants with cuffs on the bottom or rolling up your pants can make you seem shorter.Try buying pants that have cuffs sewn on the bottom, or just roll the bottoms of your pants up to your ankles or just above your ankles.


To roll up your pants, take the bottom of the pant leg and fold it over so that the inside of the pant leg is showing. Do this once or twice, depending on how short you want to make your pants look.

, Clothing with vertical stripes and colors that are different can make you appear taller. Instead of vertical stripes and monochromatic colors, wear horizontal stripes and a variety of patterns and colors. Horizontal stripes emphasize your width rather than your height, which can help you look shorter.


Horizontal stripes are common in nautically themed patterns.
Wearing a brightly colored or patterned shirt means that the attention is on your upper body rather than on your legs.Wearing a skirt or pants that are a completely different color from your top breaks up the appearance of your height.
You may also consider textured patterns (herringbone, birdseye) and waistcoats/vests., Using a wide belt is good when you are wearing a long dress and want to encourage people to forget how tall you are. A belt divides your look in half, giving you the illusion of an hourglass figure.The wider the better. Use them to cinch down dresses and long tops.

, Any clothing that breaks up the appearance of your legs is going to make you look shorter. This can be achieved by wearing capri pants, skirts that hit above the knee, and boot cut jeans. All of these can remove emphasis from your leg length.


For men, this can translate to long shorts.

, Long tops like sweaters, jackets, and shirts break up the appearance of your height, as long as they are a completely different color than your bottoms. The effect is that your legs look shorter.


Waist-length jackets can also be used to make a distinction between your legs and upper half, especially if you have a long torso.Men can also try wearing longer shirts over pants, such as leaving a shirt untucked. Make sure that the shirt is a different color than your pants.

, While carrying a small bag may emphasize your height, carrying a large bag may make you appear shorter.If you carry a purse, then you can opt for an oversized bag to hold your personal items.


Try carrying a big slouchy purse, a messenger bag, or another large type of bag.
If you have a laptop, you can try carrying it in a laptop bag with other personal belongings instead of a purse.

Use a moisturizer after showering.,
Cover redness.,
Add contouring on the rest of your face.,
Try a setting spray.",How to Look Your Best when Dealing with Allergies2," When you have allergies, your skin can get dried out, particularly if it's cold out. To help combat that dryness, use a facial moisturizer after you've showered. You don't even need to dry off before you put it on, as it will seal the moisture in.Don't forget your lips. Use a good lip balm, that's oil or cream based.
Also, drinking more water can help your skin and lips stay hydrated.

, Start with a good foundation of your choice that matches your skin tone. Next, in areas that are particularly red, such as around your nose, add a green-tinted concealer. The green tint helps cancel out the red, smoothing your complexion. Blend in the color as much as possible. Finally, add a creamy, skin-toned concealer on top of everything for a smooth finish., Contouring is the application of creams in colors that are slightly darker and slightly brighter than your skin tone to create more defined ridges and shadows on your face. For instance, you can use contouring on your cheeks to help reduce the look of puffiness.For highlighting, try making a ""fish face"" by pursing your lips. That helps draw your cheeks in so you can see your cheekbones, where you can add some highlighter. Be sure to blend it in.For more definition, you can add a bit of shadowing just under your cheekbones.
Another place to add a dab of highlighter is under your chin.
You can also just use a bit of bronzer to brighten up your face. Brush it along the top of your forehead, cheekbones, nose, and chin., Makeup tends to move around anyway, and if you have allergies, that problem just gets worse. A setting spray is sort of like hair spray for your makeup. You spray it on to ""set"" the makeup so it's less likely to move around."

Stay inside as much as possible.,
Seal off your house.,
Shower when you come in or before bed.,
Wash your sheets regularly.,
Cut down on pet dander.",How to Look Your Best when Dealing with Allergies3," Of course, it's not possible to stay inside all the time. However, when you know seasonal allergens are in the air, try staying away from the great outdoors. The less you expose yourself, the better your allergies will be.If you're allergic to ragweed, try to avoid mornings outside, while it's best to avoid being outside in the afternoon and evening if you're allergic to grass pollen.
If you're not sure when your allergies will be bad, check local pollen, mold, and grass counts.

, Another way to help your allergies is to seal the allergens outside as much as possible. That is, don't keep your windows or doors open, as that just lets allergens in. Instead, use your air conditioner to cool down your house., You pick up allergens on your skin and clothes when you go outdoors. It can help to shower before you go to sleep, so you're not taking those allergens to bed with you. You'll be giving yourself a break, and therefore, you're more likely to wake up looking refreshed., Even if you do shower before bed, dust and other allergens can build up. Make sure you are washing your sheets regularly, at least once a week. Use hot, soapy water to clean them, and dry them on hot.If washing your sheets regularly doesn't seem to help, try switching to a soap meant for sensitive skin, which should have fewer allergens in it.

, If you are allergic to your cat or dog, make sure to get them bathed often to cut down on allergens. Once a week is ideal. Also, make sure to vacuum or dust often to help remove animal dander from your home."

Choose shoes that cover up more of your feet.,
Wear flat shoes.Flats are a pretty obvious choice for tall people.,
Select the right heels.,
Try boots that go over the knee.,
Choose patterned shoes for men.",How to Look Shorter if You're Tall2," If you wear shoes that show lots of skin on the tops of your feet and around your ankles, then this may make you seem taller.Instead, choose shoes that cover more skin or that partially cover the central part of your foot.


For example, you could wear a pair of mules, oxfords, boots, open toed heels, or slide on sandals.

, Flat shoes, even sneakers with a low amount of padding, don’t add height to what you already have. You can do a lot with flats, pairing them with skinny jeans for example. Most men’s casual shoes are already flat, so just make sure you pick up a pair with a thinner sole.


Most women’s flats lack sole support, so if you are going to wear flats, either use a padded insole or make sure you aren’t going to be walking or standing for long periods of time.
Wearing flats without support in the long term can lead to injuries that limit how much you can work and enjoy life., If you want to wear heels in spite of the fact that they add to your height, choose heels with straps around the ankles. Your goal is to break up the appearance of length in your feet, ankles, and legs. You also want heels with rounded toes to make your feet look smaller.Even with thicker heels, men's shoes are not usually designed with ankle straps. Men who want to be a little taller can simply wear dress shoes with thicker heels.

, For women, pairing skirts that hit above the knee with boots that go over the knee creates even more distinction between the top and bottom of your legs. Not only does this look make you look shorter, it is fashionable and can make you feel confident.A woman could wear shorts instead of a skirt in this situation. Just make sure that some skin is visible between the boots and clothes.

, When not in a business setting, patterned shoes for men are a good idea. They shorten the appearance of the feet, and since most tall men have big feet, this will add to a shorter appearance. Patterned shoes also draw attention to the feet, preventing people from looking straight up the body.Look for textured, patterned, and colored shoes. Leather will often offer such features.

Choose a layered look.,
Create layers without cutting your hair.,
Avoid lots of volume.",How to Look Shorter if You're Tall3," Since long, straight hair has the same effect as wearing monochromatic colors and vertical stripes—making you look taller—you should choose a look that is layered. Getting a haircut with many long and short layers will distract people from how tall you are.Many waves in your hair can also achieve this effect.
If you have natural waves, use a gel to capture them.
If you have naturally straight hair, use a curling iron, overnight curlers, or hot rollers. You can even use a hair dryer over a rounded brush to create waves.

, If you have long, straight hair that you don’t want to cut, you may want to try putting it up in different ways to create the illusion of layers. You can accomplish this by pulling back only the top layer of hair or pinning up different areas of hair.


You can also try braiding techniques that make your hair look layered., Avoid hairstyles that add inches to your height, like pompadours and styles with a lot of volume. However, volume is ok if it’s below the crown and does not push your hair up above your head.By the same token, avoid messy buns on top of your head.


If you want volume, add a volumizing product to the hair around the sides of your face.

Practice good posture.,
Sit down frequently.,
Get on the same level with people.,
Place yourself near other tall people.",How to Look Shorter if You're Tall4," Slouching may seem like it will help you to appear shorter, but it will not. The idea is to make yourself appear less tall because slouching rounds your back and shoulders. This may lower your height one or two inches, but it can also cause you to appear unhealthy or like you lack confidence. Slouching appears less professional and can cause physical pain and permanent spine damage.Instead, practice good posture because it makes you appear confident and is better for you. Confidence is the key to fashion for tall men and women.Place your shoulders back and keep them relaxed.
Look in the mirror and make sure that from the side, you could draw a straight line from your earlobe to your ankle.

, Always take the opportunity to sit when you can find it, especially at social functions where there are few other tall people. Sitting can help people forget that you are tall because it puts you on the same level.


If you have a long torso, try to find a chair that is lower than others, or a bar stool or office chair that is adjustable.

, Stay aware of your position in relation to the person you are having a conversation with. If you are on a platform that places you higher than the person you’re talking to, find a way to step off of it. Even though you’re taller than the other person, being on even ground with them is better than being positioned even higher.


For example, if you stop to talk to someone on the stairs, step down a few steps.

, To minimize how much others notice your height, try standing around people who are also tall. For example, during gym class or on the playground, look for tall people and go make friends with them. Finding others of the same height can also make you feel less self-conscious and more confident, therefore less likely to slouch.


If no one’s height compares to yours, find the tallest people you can.

Embrace your curves.,
Show some skin.,
Tailor your clothes.,
Wear bold makeup.,
Accessorize subtly.",How to Look Sexy if You Are Big1," Don’t try to hide your tummy or drown your body in a sea of fabric. Wear clothes that are fitted to your shape. Don’t be afraid to wear a bodycon dress or a form-fitting top. Love your curves and show them off in your sexiest outfits. Take time to research your coloring, face shape, and body shape, so you can pick out styles and colors that bring out your natural beauty. However, a fit and flare dress and a pair of heels will always be flattering., Lots of plus-size models have been rocking crop tops lately; try a crop top that shows off a layer of skin a few inches above your belly paired with a pair of high waisted jeans or a high waisted skirt. You should show off whatever body part you love about yourself, whether it’s your stomach, your butt, or your legs. You’ll feel and look sexiest when you’re showing the skin you love., If you find a piece of clothing you love but it doesn’t fit quite perfectly, bring it to a tailor to have it fitted specifically for you. You can get some garments tailored for under $20. Sometimes it’s good to buy a few pieces of clothing that fit really well rather than having many pieces of clothing that don’t look quite right.It’s not your fault for not “fitting” into clothes; the garment should fit you!

, Go for a dramatic smoky eye with black eyeliner, dark eyeshadow, and mascara. Fill in or accentuate dark, bold eyebrows. Unless the bold, red lip makes you feel sexier, opt for a toned-down, subtle pink lip, where only the bottom lip is lined. Use blush from your cheekbone to your temple to define your face even more., Don’t feel the need to over-accessorize. Some stylists recommend going for a bold print instead of a statement necklace. Try wearing a subtle pair of earrings or a few thin rings. You could also wear a simple pendant if you are wearing a simple top with a high neckline."

Instead of always wearing T-shirts, try wearing men's plaid shirts over jeans or khakis. In more formal circumstances, wear a jacket over your shirt. Dress up in a dress suit once in a while. Go for the business, business casual or/and preppy look. If you're in a university, the preppy look is the best.;
, Wearing clothes too baggy can give the impression of sloppiness, and clothing too tight will just look feminine and embarrassing.

, Most men think that having 2-3 pair of shoes is enough. However, if you have only a pair or two of shoes, they will get worn-off faster and most probably they will look trashy if worn too often. Try to invest in some quality dress shoes, as well as some casual loafers or desert boots. Besides, if you wear a pair of shoes too often, you'll get smelly feet.

, Avoid clothes in colors that are too bright as they tend to be too trendy, and are too ostentatious and zealous to display wealth.

, This one sounds easy, but if you are too lazy, you should struggle with it. Wash daily.

, More and more men are using cosmetics and cleansers these days in order to look good. Don't assume that you will look fine without cleaning the black spots and acne from your skin. Don't assume that just washing your face with soap will make it look good and healthy.

, Joining a golf association or certain upscale clubs is a perfect opportunity to climb the social ladder. Just because they will keep you away from your dream - becoming one of the preppy kids. However, don't be rude and nasty to them, just don't get very close to them.

, Be calm yet out-spoken, and take the time to add new words to your vocabulary. Appearing educated is key.

, Wealthy people tend to be thin and in shape. You will feel better and your clothes will fit better.

, Get contact lenses or sunglasses instead of ordinary ones. After all, you don't want to look nerdy. If your teeth are not in a good condition, go to the dentist. If your nose is too big (either too long, tall or/and wide), consider some plastic surgery.

, It doesn't have to be a Rolex or Tag Heuer, as long as it looks classic and masculine. Try to go for stainless steel or gold if you can afford it. Stay away from watches that are too trendy, such as ones with square faces, or digital watches.

, Even if it's not that posh or expensive, buy a car that looks cool and expensive. A wealthy guy wouldn't want to be seen in a Yaris. Make sure it is clean and well maintained. If you hate driving or can't drive, use Taxis if possible, but avoid public transport at any cost. A vintage Mercedes roadster or a cabriolet is classier than a recent model.

, Most of the time you can find amazing deals on lightly worn designer clothes, jewelry, and even cars for a fraction of the cost, and they will come shipped right to your doorstep.

Try a chemical peel.",How to Look Younger at 50," Include both cardiovascular and strength exercises in your routine. Cardiovascular exercise gets your blood pumping and strength exercises can tone flabby skin associated with age.


Improved circulation supplies more nutrients and oxygen to your skin.
Exercise also increases your supply of collagen and fights against damaging free radicals in your body.
Cardiovascular exercise can also lead to weight loss, and shedding a few extra pounds and some excess fat can drop your perceived age by several years.;
, Stress can create more wrinkles and general wear on your skin. Relaxing more often may not undo the damage already done, but it can prevent your skin from aging any faster than necessary from this point on.


A simple trick to try is to laugh more throughout the day. Laugh decreases stress hormones in the body and forces the muscles in your face to relax. If you don't feel like you have anything to laugh about look up jokes on the internet, or watch a funny movie or a comedian.
On a similar note, you should also get six to eight hours of sleep each night. Dark, puffy eyes can make you look older, but getting enough sleep can clear those bags away. Keep in mind severe allergies can also cause dark circles, so get your allergies under control by avoiding the things that cause them, or by taking allergy medication (doctor approved, of course). Moreover, sleep reduces the body's production of stress hormone, which is good, because stress hormone can make your skin appear less elastic and less healthy.

, It's a simple trick, but straightening your posture gives the appearance of confidence, and confidence is a trait commonly associated with youth. Walking around with your back straight and your head high can shave a few years off your age in a matter of minutes.

, Use a gentle exfoliating wash on your skin one to three times each week. The process of exfoliation strips away dead skin cells and stimulates the production of new skin cells. As a result, your skin looks clearer, more elastic, and more youthful.

, Age causes skin to dry out, and dry, fine skin is more likely to develop wrinkles. Use a moisturizing cream on your face that is labeled as a face lotion, don't use hand lotion on your face. The reason for this is the hand lotions might be too strong and could cause you to break out. Yes, even we can break out at our age if we use the wrong products! Use hand lotion on your hands that has sunblock in it to help prevent age spots. One trick is to pat your face dry after a shower, and to put the lotion on your face immediately while your skin is still hydrated from the shower. The reason you pat your face is that the more rubbing and pulling you do to your face makes the wrinkles and bags under your eyes happen faster as your skin becomes more fragile and less elastic with age.


Similarly, you should use a moisturizing lip balm to keep the skin on your lips healthy and plump, as well. They also sell lip plumping lipstick and lip gloss.

, UV rays from the sun can damage and age your skin even faster. Prevent this from happening by wearing sunscreen when you go outside. You should also consider wearing sunglasses and a wide-brimmed hat to protect your skin even further. Sun damage can also cause freckles or skin cancer, so it's best to avoid the sun's rays anyway


On a similar note, you should also avoid the use of tanning beds. The tanning process makes your skin look dry and wrinkled, which will make you look older.

, Smoking wrinkles the skin and turns both your nails and teeth yellow. Quitting the habit will not turn back the clock, but it can at least prevent the clock from speeding forward any faster than it naturally would.

, Your body builds up free radicals over time, and these free radicals can speed up the aging process. Antioxidants battle these free radicals, though, keeping them in check and even reversing some signs of aging in the process.


Good sources of antioxidants include berries and other colorful fruit, nuts, dark chocolate, coffee, fruit juice, cooked vegetables, and beans.

, Excess sugar in the body can cause your body to undergo a process called glycation. This process can damage the collagen in your skin. When this happens, your skin becomes less elastic and wrinkles can form more easily.

, A glass of wine every few days should not do too much damage, but consuming alcohol in excess can cause multiple health problems. Taking care of your health is a good way to retain your youth.

, In addition to those foods already mentioned, stock up on foods that can provide you with vitamins and minerals your body needs to repair aged, damaged skin.Eat more zinc-rich oysters. Zinc repairs damaged skin.
Olive oil and avocados contain good fats that can prevent further wrinkling.
Water-based produce, like watermelon and cucumbers, keep the skin hydrated.
Guava is packed with vitamin C and can help restore collagen levels.
Sweet potatoes contain beta-carotene, which can fight against dry skin and improve your cell-turnover rate.
Women should also eat more legumes, soy, red clover tea, and ground flaxseeds. All of these are good sources of phytoestrogens, which can fight against drooping skin.
Eat less white rice and white bread, substitute brown rice and whole grain bread.

, For women, one of the more distressing signs of age is the ""turkey neck""--saggy skin that hangs just below the face. Fashion scarves offer a quick, stylish way to cover up that patch of skin and shave off a few years from your face.


Choose a lightweight scarf with a simple design and avoid scarves with unnecessary frills or embellishments. The idea is to cover your neck up without drawing attention to that area of your body.
Avoid heavy scarves and turtlenecks since they often add too much unflattering bulk to the neck area.

, Gray hair gives away your age. Consult a professional hair stylist and discuss color treatments that can make your hair look more youthful without causing any more damage to it.


Avoid home treatments since many of the chemicals found in commercial hair dyes can dry out and damage hair further.
Typically, your best bet is to choose a shade similar to your natural hair color before gray hair started to appear.

, Talk to your hair stylist about options that may work for you. Keep in mind that as hair ages, it tends to weaken. As a result, longer hair often has less body and looks more unhealthy than shorter hair once you reach your 50s.


If your hair is naturally curly, work with it rather than working against it. Curls can actually look fresher and younger at this age. Moreover, the treatments needed to straighten curly hair may only damage it further.
Consider adding bangs. Bangs can mask skin imperfections that come with age. Choose long, wispy bangs or sideswept bangs over heavy, straight-cut styles.
Try getting your hair blown out at a salon. This process can straighten wiry gray hairs while giving the rest of your hair more youthful body.
Consider getting a softer hairstyle. Harsh hairstyles, such as ramrod straight hair, or an angular cut doesn't usually look good on older women, while a soft hairstyle, with gentle waves softens the face and is generally more attractive. Look at hair magazines for ideas. Can cut out the hairstyles you are interested in to bring into your stylist. Not all hairstyles will look good on you, so take the advice of a hairstylist you trust on what will and won't work.

, You might feel tempted to mask signs of aging by wearing more make-up, but in actuality, wearing fewer cosmetics will actually do more for your appearance.

Opt for sheer lip glosses, lip pencils, and lip stains. Avoid lipsticks with heavy pigmentation. If you have wrinkles on your lips and your lipstick doesn't stay put you might need to use a lip pencil to outline your lips. If you do use a lip pencil be careful it matches your lipstick as close as you can, you don't want the lip pencil to be noticeable.
Choose a blush that blends into your skin color and apply it higher on the cheekbone, away from the nose, to counteract the natural sagging of skin that comes with age. Use a powder blush, liquid blush is more difficult to apply evenly and doesn't look as natural.
Avoid products with a shimmer, pearl or sparkle finish.
Line the eye with eye shadow instead of traditional liner. If your eyelids droop over your eyes then the shadow might transfer, and might not work for you. In that case you might want to try a gel eyeliner that comes with a little brush. You line your eyes as close to the eyelashes as possible and with a thin line, not thick. I suggest charcoal or brown-black, straight black is just too dark. Your eye make-up needs to look softer and less severe overall.







, Older women usually have some hair that grows on your chin as you age. If it is too much trouble to do this on a regular basis you can get the chin hair professionally removed, but that costs more, and it doesn't always work and get all of it., If your eyelashes have thinned out with age, apply false lashes or lash extensions to make your eyes look younger. Natural styles tend to work better since glamorous ones are more likely to look fake.

, Younger people usually have darker eyebrows, and the color fades with age, so if your eyebrows disappear over time, or are faded then pencil them in with an eyebrow pencil with light feathery strokes following your natural eyebrows, you could also use shadow especially made for eyebrows that is sold in any grocery or other similar store, some eyebrow kits actually have eyebrow stencils, to help you with where the eyebrow shadow should go. Don't overdo it, practice, start light at first and darken up. It is much easier to darken your eyebrows than to overdo it and have to wash it off and start over again., Pluck out or wax away eyebrow hairs that have grown too long. You can also pluck out gray eyebrow hair or dye it a shade or two darker than your hair color.


One of the biggest mistakes you can make is to pluck out all of your eyebrows and draw them in artificially with eyebrow pencil, or to get them tattooed on. This technique looks unnatural and will age you further, making you look older instead of younger.

, If you've begun balding, you might be tempted to hide your bald spot by combing your remaining hair over it or by wearing a toupee. Both options are not practical, however, since both are generally very noticeable. Moreover, in your desperation to hide your bald spot, you may actually make yourself look older to those looking at you.


A better option is simply to get your hair cut short. Having short hair looks neater and may make your bald spot less noticeable. Moreover, since men of all ages can wear short buzz-cuts, the style itself does not reveal your age.

, If your facial hair is still growing even after the hair on top of your head has fallen out, you could try maintaining a neatly groomed mustache, beard, or combination style.


While a lack of facial hair may have given you a ""baby face"" when you were younger, maintaining it as you get older can draw the eye away from the top of your head.
Additionally, facial hair has a certain ruggedness associated with it. Your body might be wearing down with age, but facial hair can give the opposite impression and make you look as sturdy and strong as ever.
Sometimes the beard gets gray before your hair does, if it bothers you too much you can buy over the counter dye kits made especially to dye beards and mustaches where they sell women's hair dye in grocery stores so you can dye it yourself. Just be sure to follow the directions.

, If you still have plenty of hair but see it turning gray or white, talk to your barber about getting the hair dyed. Aim for a shade close to the natural color you sported in your youth. If your hair has already been gray or white for a long time, you might want to consider going for a salt-and-pepper look, instead, since that could look more natural.


Talk to a haircare professional before changing your hair color. Boxed dyes can contain chemicals that may weaken or damage your hair further. If you dye your hair yourself make sure you follow all of the directions for best results.

, The hair in your ears and nose generally grows faster and longer once you reach your 40s and 50s, so untrimmed hair in these areas is both untidy and a clear sign of age. Trim the hair whenever you can see it sticking out.


On a similar note, if you have unruly white hair sticking out from beneath your collar, you should trim that every few days, as well. You could also have the neck hair permanently removed to lessen the hassle of shaving it yourself all the time.

, Retinoid creams help the body produce more collagen, and collagen renews your skin, making it look younger and healthier while minimizing the appearance of wrinkles and age spots.


You can get over-the-counter retinoid creams, but prescription versions are more potent and may have a more dramatic effect.
Attend to your fingernails. By this I mean look at them, are they normal or have they become yellow and thick? If they have yellowed that might mean you have a fungus, it is easily taken care of and your nails can look youthful again. Check with your doctor, he/she can prescribe an antifungal liquid for it. They also sell antifungal liquid at most grocery stores in the medicine department.

, They now have ""invisible"" braces to make it less noticeable that your teeth are getting aligned. Having beautiful teeth makes anyone more attractive, no matter your age., Yellowed teeth are another common sign of age. You can use a home whitening kit on your teeth for a quick fix, but for something that will last longer, see your dentist and ask to have a professional teeth whitening done. Keep in mind some foods discolor teeth, as does smoking. If you want your teeth to stay white avoid foods and drinks that are more likely to stain your teeth, such as coffee, for example.

, While acupuncture is technically a form of alternative medicine, you still need to go to a licensed professional to have the procedure done. It is a far more natural treatment than cosmetic injections, however, which reduces the risk of an adverse reaction.


Acupuncture needles are inserted into the face, neck, and head. They stimulate skin cells and improve circulation, so your skin ends up producing more collagen and elastin. As a result, the skin in those areas becomes firmer and more youthful in appearance., Treatments that use laser waves and radio waves cause microscopic fissures to form in the skin, and these fissures stimulate collagen production.


Radio wave treatments can be quite painful, but if you can endure them, you should notice considerably firmer, younger looking skin within six months.

, Hyaluronic acid fillers are injected into the skin, where they spread out and fill wrinkles and similar age lines. As a result, even the smallest lines of your face can look smoother within a short period of time.There are different filler treatments available, so talk to your doctor about which one might be best for you. Surface fillers work great on small lines and cause very little bruising, but deeper fillers might be necessary for deeper wrinkles.

, This specialized procedure is used to lessen or eliminate spider veins. Since spider veins are associated with age, removing them can make you look younger.


The procedure used to be very painful, but newer techniques have made the procedure quicker and less uncomfortable.

, During this procedure, pulsed light is combined with a specialized topical drug to destroy abnormally pigmented skin cells. Within two or three sessions, sun-aged skin can look closer to its natural age.


Note that this treatment also has a practical purpose since it can be used to target precancerous cells, as well.

, During this procedure, acid is used to burn away the top layers of skin. This removes damaged skin and stimulates new skin growth, which can lead to a smoother, younger looking face.


Trichloroacetic acid peels are among the most common chemical peels.
Some treatments can cause scabbing and may take several weeks to heal, but there are a few newer treatments that can result in less immediate pain and discomfort.

This kind of lighting softens your features and many photographers recommend it for looking your best.

You can also create flattering light by lighting candles.Something else you can do is swap out your regular light bulbs for bulbs with red or pink hues.;
, Instead of posing straight on, try posing at a ¾ angle. This angle will play up the curves and angles of your body. Along with standing at an angle, you should pose asymmetrically. For example, bend on knee or place on hand on your hip.Choose a pose that feels comfortable and natural to you, as this will often translate to a sexy look. Trying to pose yourself too much can make you look stilted or awkward.

, If you want to accentuate your curves, lie down on your side. This position will show off your waist and hips. To show off your muscles, prop yourself on your elbows. Propping yourself off will tense your muscles more than laying flat will., First, you will need to exfoliate while in the shower. You can use a loofah or exfoliating product. Then, use a self-tanner and apply it to areas of your body that you would like to accentuate or make to look leaner. For example, apply tanner along your abdomen if you want to show off your muscles. Or, apply the tanner along the sides of your waist and inner thighs to create a shadow. You can also use bronzer or darker foundation to contour, but it will rub off easily and may stain the sheets., The right lotion can blend imperfections and make your skin glow. A shimmery lotion is good for making your skin glow. A tinted lotion is best for blending in sun spots and rashes. If blemishes are a concern, you can use foundation to blend imperfections in with your natural skin tone.Make sure to test the product or ask about it if you have sensitive skin.

, Leaving on a few accessories is sexy and can help you feel more confident while naked. Leave on a few pieces of jewelry if you wear any—like earrings or a necklace. You can also leave on a tie or bowtie. If you wear high heels, keep them on because they make your legs look longer and engage your muscles."

Be honest about it, like if she looks abnormally good you can tell her that you really like her hair, makeup, clothes, etc.

, Don't wear a wrinkled up shirt that's too short. Don't wear dirty, muddy shoes. Wear nice clean shoes, jeans with or without a design on the back pockets. Wear a fresh, white t-shirt under your regular shirt. Pull your pants up. Buy all your clothes in the same color, like red, so that everything matches. Get a hat that matches your shoes, not a fitted cap. If your ear is pierced, put something decent there.

The four areas of outer beauty are:

The Lion.,
The Bird of Paradise.,
The Lily.,
The Chihuahua.",How to Master the Kung Fu to Pure Beauty2,"
The Bird of Paradise, which represents charm.
The Lily, which represents smell.
The Chihuahua, which represents fashion.

, Your hair is one of the most important things that have to do with outer beauty. Treat it well. First, you need to get the right conditioner and shampoo. If your hair's thin, purchase products specifically for thickening or volume. If you've got dandruff, there are many shampoo options to cure it!


Generously squeeze some shampoo onto the palm of your hand. Lather it from your scalp to the tips of your hair until a thick foam appears, then rinse it out thoroughly and repeat; unless the bottle states to leave it in for a designated time first. Get the same amount of conditioner (or less, if your hair is oily!) and do the same. While it is still in your hair, carefully run a wide-toothed comb through it. Rinse and blow dry.

, Charm is very important; like hair. Develop good charisma. The better you can talk to people, the better you are as a person, which kind of falls into the inner beauty category. Also, remember that no makeup is much better then a bad makeup application. If you are unsure on how well you did your makeup, ask someone you trust for a review.

, How you smell is who you are! If you smell terrible, what does that say about yourself? ""I'm someone you surely don't want to be around"", that's what it says! Find a good perfume, an anti-perspirant deodorant and you're on your way!

, Have well-fitting clothes. If you are rounder, go for flow. Skinnier? Aim for a little bit of tightness. Also, select good colors. Ones that bring out your eyes are great finds! Pat yourself on the back and walk out of the store with your head held high.

Get comfortable with being naked.,
Don’t compare yourself to others.,
Put yourself in a sexy mindset.,
Think about the parts of your body that you love.,
Embrace your flaws.,
Let your partner touch you.,
Work on your overall self-esteem.",How to Look Sexy when Naked2," To feel sexy, it’s important to feel comfortable naked. Try walking around your home naked with the shades drawn to feel more relaxed without clothes on. Sleep naked so you can feel comfortable with no clothes on in bed. Don’t worry if you feel uncomfortable at first. Let your worries out so that you can start to enjoy being naked.


It will help your comfort if you’re in a familiar setting. If you’re home alone, try being naked in your favorite spot of your home.

, It’s easy to compare yourself to others when you see advertisements filled with people that have great bodies—many of them photoshopped. Do not get caught in that web of comparison. There isn’t an ideal body. That type of thinking is harmful to your mental state. Instead, celebrate the fact that there are so many types of bodies and enjoy the body you have., A good way to start putting yourself in a sexy mindset is to hold yourself with confidence. Stand up straight. Move with confidence and act flirtatiously. Then, think back to a moment where you felt sexy and/or confident. It may be when a partner complimented your appearance, or when you did a great job at work. Keep that moment in mind and let it affect your energy., Everyone’s body is unique. Consider the parts of your body that you love or find sexy. You may love the way the muscles in your shoulders look, or you may have always felt confident about your legs. Try to focus on these parts of your body when you are naked.You may find your lower back sexy. You could then position yourself so your lower back is visible, and you can show off this part of your back.

, Your perceived flaws might be keeping you from feeling sexy without your clothes on. Instead of feeling bad about what you see as flaws, think of how they could be perceived as sexy. You may feel insecure about scars, stretch marks, or cellulite, but there are plenty of people that would find them sexy. Any time you start to feel bad about your flaws, change your thinking to embrace them as sexy., It sounds like a simple thing, but it can sometimes feel uncomfortable to be touched on the parts of your body you feel insecure about. If you have a partner, don’t shy away from them touching you. Allow them to caress and massage your body.It’s okay if you don’t want to be touched in certain areas. If you try it and feel too uncomfortable, don’t be afraid to ask them to stop.

, Another way you can look sexy is to maintain a confident attitude. Having high self-esteem and confidence will be attractive and sexy to others. Focus on maintaining good self-esteem and having a healthy amount of self-confidence.

Eat less sugary things and cut down on fatty foods. Start drinking more water. You won't be so dehydrated and won't have as many headaches.

, It doesn't matter if you have a flat chest, or short legs. As long as you keep your body fit and at a healthy weight, you'll look great.

, Put lotion all over your body to keep it silky smooth. You may also want to try exfoliating, too, otherwise you will just be moisturizing dead skin. Your hands, elbows and knees are especially important to moisturize, as they are prone to dryness.

, Always use cleanser and moisturizer, and perhaps toner. Ask your dermatologist what will be best for your skin. For instance, if you are prone to spots, you may want to try using a top-selling brand of skin care and acne medication . It is also a good idea to exfoliate your face, and use face-masks, but not too much, as this will strip your face of essential oils.

, If you do so every day, you will only have a few hairs to pluck each time, meaning you won't have to go through much pain. If you aren't sure what shape you should be plucking them into, go to a salon and get a professional wax. After this, it will be easier to keep them neat and tidy. Use some petroleum jelly based product to slick them down, and if need be, use some eyebrow pencil to darken them.

, You may look nice in a dimly lit room, but when you go out in the sunlight discover you have made many errors in your makeup application. If you can, buy a lighted makeup mirror and use this. Now for the application of the makeup...


Apply a foundation, preferably liquid and matching your skin tone. Then, for the perfect skin, apply a dusting of powder. This will also seal the foundation in place. Finally, top it off with a bit of rouge to define your cheekbones.






When it comes to eyeshadow, where which ever colour you have discovered suits you (see step 1.) You will also know how you like to wear your eyeliner, if any. However, I do recommend you always wear mascara, even if it simply clear. Beforehand, use eyelash curlers.






Using lip liner gives your lips a much more polished look. NEVER wear lip liner a darker or lighter shade than your lipstick. Apply the liner to all of your lips, not just the outside, and then apply the lipstick over.







, Apply to your wrists, neck, hands, forearms, temples, and the backs of your knees. Do not wear too much, though, as this will overpower people.

, Soaking your hands in a moisturising scented oil will leave them smelling and looking lovely. Match your nail varnish with your clothing, and stay away from the black polish. If you want a dark colour, go for a deep purple, or crimson.

Don't starve yourself or try to force your body to be thinner than it naturally is; it won't work in the long run and you could end up with serious health problems. Eat a healthy diet that includes fruit, vegetables, protein, and enough water.;
, Make sure to take in plenty of cool water each day. Water flushes away the toxins and gives your skin a natural glow. Avoid drinking too many caffeinated drinks and minimize alcohol intake.


Drink at least 8 glasses of water per day.
Veggie drinks are also a healthy choice.

,, What sort of skin do you have––combination, oily, dry? What texture is your hair? How does your body respond to specific beauty products? Knowing these things will help you to develop a beauty regime that keeps you looking beautiful naturally. The following steps will help you to find out these things and apply them successfully.

, Only exfoliate your skin once or twice a week, though. Over exfoliating can make you more prone to breakouts.

, This will keep your skin soft and will also keep your skin beautiful as you get older.


Use moisturizer at night to keep it from trapping sweat and dirt that gather on your face during the day.

, Boil 1.5 liters (0.4 US gal) of water until it is very hot. Pour the boiling water into a bowl as soon as you can, whilst it is still very hot. Move your face above the bowl of hot water and face it downwards (put a towel over your head for maximum benefit). You'll be able to feel a lot of heat getting to your face as if it is getting steamed. This is a very good method to reduce acne and any scars you have as the heat fights it back into your skin and almost kills it.

, Skip the foundation unless you really, really need it. Heavy makeup hides true beauty! Work on your skin instead, applying coconut oil to your face before you turn in for the night will smooth and clear your skin tone plus it treats acne. Add some pink blush to the apples of your cheeks (smile when you're putting it on). Swipe on chapstick to your lips to keep them lush looking.


Avoid overusing makeup. Too much makeup can destroy a healthy glow. It also trains people to expect a less-than-natural you.
Try going without makeup for a few days. Allowing your skin to breathe will be better in the long run. When you do put makeup back on, it will look even better than before!
Always wash your face and remove any makeup before going to bed.

, Or, pluck them yourself, but make sure you know how to do it correctly and be careful. This will help to open up your eyes. But don't pluck them too much, over-plucked eyebrows can be just as bad as messy ones! Look up some guides on how to pick the right eyebrows for your face shape first, and if you're still not sure then go to a beautician and ask their advice.


Try curling your eyelashes, if they do not have a natural curl. It will open your eyes and give you a nicer appearance, even without mascara.

, Always wash your hair with warm to lukewarm water, never hot. Hot water strips off all the natural oils. Depending on the season, style it so that you are comfortable and your hair is protected from environmental hazards.


Always keep your hair brushed. To keep it in place during the day, spray on a little leave-in conditioner. Keep your hair neatly groomed.
Regularly massage your scalp with a healthy oil such as coconut oil, olive oil, egg oil or castor oil, leaving on overnight.
Use a quality shampoo and conditioner (you might like to use only organic products, if you can afford these). To avoid over-drying the hair, avoid anything with sulfates in it. Avoid repeating shampoo application (usually for more foamy feeling) since it depletes the natural lipids of the scalp leading to dryness and dandruff.
To get rid of residue, occasionally add a little baking soda to your shampoo.

, Consider using mouth wash and dental floss for fresh breath and cleaner teeth.


Brush your teeth with a pinch of baking powder, salt and vinegar to make them brighter.

, When outside, protect your skin with a sunscreen. make sure you apply the sun sunscreen at least 15 min before you step out into the sun. Choose a sunscreen that is oil-free and non-comedogenic, so it won't clog your pores.

, You'll reveal a new you. Avoid drinking Pepsi, Coke etc. They stain your teeth giving your smile a yellow look. Brush brush brush!


Many people believe in the value of practicing daily or regular gratitude. Counting your blessings can help to keep you positive and smiling.

, Roll your shoulders a few times to feel where they should be. Keep your chin up. Keep your head balanced atop your shoulders, avoiding ""forward-head posture.""

, If you aren't, then try to be. Try some assertiveness training and affirmations. Tell yourself regularly that you are beautiful and always will be.


Seek to be happy with who you are. This can take time to learn, and it can be buffeted now and then by events in life, but try to make this your grounded point and always return to being happy with who you are now, who you were in the past and who you will become.
Never say you're not pretty, that will make you upset. Always be confident and think positive and this will come through in your poise and voice.

, Try to avoid wearing clothes that do not flatter your figure. You don't need to religiously stick to every single fashion tip you come across (most are quite boring anyway) but do take the time to learn how to bring out the beauty of your unique figure.


Wear some matching accessories with your dress to give you a pretty and modern look.
Seek to be happy with who you are. This can take time to learn, and it can be buffeted now and then by events in life, but try to make this your grounded point and always return to being happy with who you are now, who you were in the past and who you will become.

, Too much will make your face looked cake up, and like you are seeking attention. It's also not natural, so it will be obvious that that is not what you truly look like.


Wearing some makeup is alright. As long as you don't overdo it.
Wear skin colored eyeshadow, and carefully blend it in to match your skin tone.
Light pink blush will do.
Nude or a light colored lipstick can also be added to complete the look (Preferably in light pink, or red).

Look for clothes and jewelry made by Native American designers and artists.,
Look for items that are labeled “Native Made” or “Indian made.” The Indian Arts and Crafts Act protects items that were native made, and only these authentic items are allowed to have this label.If the label says it was made somewhere across the world, it’s probably not an authentic item, and Native American designers and artisans won’t benefit from its purchase.,
Research brands to find out their history.,
Skip the mass-produced imitation items.,
Think about the history of what you wear.,
Understand that some items are probably best left to their inventors.,
Learn about Native American history.Knowing more about the history of how Native American cultures have historically been oppressed in the US will help you understand why something as seemingly simple as wearing a piece of jewelry is actually very meaningful.What you choose to wear can either be a celebration of a culture’s beauty or a sign of deep disrespect, and learning more will show you the difference.,
Don’t try to “look” Native American - unless you are.,
Wear a few special pieces instead of an entire outfit.,
Don’t go out in a costume.",How to Look Native American," Buying clothes and jewelry made and directly sold by people you've actually met or talked to ensures that credit is given where it’s due. Artists from many different Native American cultures sell beautiful clothes, jewelry and other accessories. Check online for Native American retailersor shop locally for more options.


This way you can also get a better understanding of the historical and cultural significance of the items you wear. For example, if you buy a piece of jewelry directly from the person who made it, you can ask him or her to tell you more about what’s behind the design.
Making sure Native American artists and designers are in control of the sales of their own goods is really important. When Native American symbols and designs get manufactured and sold out of context, their significance gets lost, and that's detrimental to the individual cultures responsible for these highly sought after items.;
,, If there's a brand making a Native American-inspired item that catches your eye, do some research to see how it's being manufactured and what the company's business practices are. Even if the company isn't Native-American owned, its owners might be using practices that you can get behind. See if you can find out the following:

Does the company credit the artist or group of people who originally inspired the design or product they're selling? Do they get the proceeds?
Does the product perpetuate Native American stereotypes of any kind, or does its design and manufacture honor the spirit in which it was created?

, Since Native American-inspired designs have become so popular, it’s easy to find mass-produced “Native American” products in every mall. But these items aren’t authentic, and more importantly, the people who originally created the designs don’t benefit from their sales.


Avoid fake versions of Native American items, like plastic headdresses or cheap imitations of animal pendant jewelry, especially if they were factory made in a different country. These were not made by people who understand the cultural significance behind such items.The same goes for traditional patterns and trademarks that some cultures hold sacred. For example, items like underwear and liquor flasks with Navajo-inspired prints don't honor Navajo culture., Do you know the origin of that Cherokee-inspired pattern on the t-shirt you bought? If not, take the time to find out. If you wear something created by another culture and to which you have no personal connection, you might be committing a huge faux pas without even realizing it.


Before you decide to wear something around, think about what it means, and conduct some research to dig deeper.Whether it’s a pair of moccasins with the classic thunderbird beading, feather earrings or a sweater with a bold native-inspired design, it’s important to think about the history of clothes and jewelry that have Native American roots, so you can be respectful to those who created them.
If you choose to wear something you do know has cultural significance without acknowledging it, that’s a form of cultural appropriation - taking something that’s not yours and pretending like it is.

, Some items are fine to wear, but some might have sacred meaning or a history that makes them ill-advised to wear unless you're part of a particular tradition. In these cases it’s important to be willing to not wear something, even if you think it’s beautiful and have no intention to cause any harm.


For example, feathers, headdresses and warbonnets have particular spiritual meaning. Some of these items must be earned and received through special ceremonies. Therefore, they are not to be worn casually by people unfamiliar with the cultures from which these practises stem.,, Trying to look as though you’re part of a culture other than your own is not a good idea. If you’re attracted to Native American designs and art, educate yourself about Native American history and learn how to honor Native American values without appropriating them.

Even famous fashion designers, musicians, sports teams and movie stars are guilty of perpetuating stereotypes and crossing the line.But many groups have spoken out against these practices and called on non-Native Americans to stop. For example, the “Change the Mascot” campaign calls on the National Football League to stop using an offensive mascot for the NFL team in Washington, DC.Making your best effort to be well informed will help you express yourself through fashion without hurting other people.

, If you dress “Native American” from head to toe but you don’t have Native American heritage, you’re making a statement that you’re someone you’re not. Wearing a pair of moccasins or some turquoise jewelry is a fine choice, but decking yourself out in every item you own at once is probably over the top - and a little too close to trying to “look” Native American.

, Don’t dress up like a stereotypical version of a Native American for any reason - even if it’s for a costume party or Halloween. Even if you think it’s all in good fun, it’s disrespectful and ultimately harmful. You might mean well, but even if you’re dressing up as a favorite character from a book, show or movie, it’s still not OK to put on this type of costume. Your costume choice could be very offensive to some people."

Do Indiana's hair in the movie.,
Put on her makeup.,
Do Indiana's wardrobe.",How to Look Like Indiana Evans from ''Blue Lagoon: the Awakening," It's so flowing and beachy. You can achieve her hairstyle very easily.


First, get your hair cut correctly, so the style turns out exactly or at least similar to Indiana's. Ask your hairdresser for face-framing layers that end around collarbone length and blend out with the rest of your hair. You'll also need long layers. This can be done by cutting upwards into the hair. Indiana definitely has a piece-y look, as well, so ask your hairdresser to also texturize (a.k.a. ""shatter"") your hair with a pair of texturizing shears. However, bring in a photo to your hairdresser of Indiana, so she can envision the cut you're wanting, thus giving you a more accurate haircut.
Indiana has dirty blonde, yet golden hair. Get your hairdresser's opinion on this and color your hair like Indiana's. Consider temporarily coloring your hair.
Now that your hair is cut and colored like Indiana's, focus on the styling. There are a few methods you can try.

The first method is the heatless braids method. Start with damp hair. Part your hair down the middle and section hair into two sections. Then, section each section into two sections: shorter layers in one section, and longer layers in the other section. French braid all sections, and spray your hair with a bit of texturizing or sea salt spray. Straighten the ends of your hair in the braid. Sleep on the braids. When you wake up, carefully undo the braids, massage your scalp for a few minutes to loosen the hair, and possibly flip your hair over and tousle. Finally, spray and scrunch with some texturizing or sea salt spray. This is the easiest technique.
The next method is using a curling iron. Start with straight hair, and once again, part your hair down the middle. Curl your hair outwards, holding each fairly large section for 5-8 seconds for a loose wave. Hold the face framing pieces for a bit longer, let the hair cool to set it, then run your fingers through and tousle the hair. Make sure you're curling the hair outwards. Also, when curling, leave out about an inch or so of hair out of the curling iron. You can also just straighten the ends of your hair when you're finished. Texturizing or sea salt spray is optional. You may decide to S-wave a few pieces for more texture.

;
, Indiana has what is known as a ""baby face."" This simply means she has beautiful, plump features.


Use a thin base. Tinted moisturizer or BB Cream works fine. If you have spots that need coverage, use an opaque stick concealer. If you suffer from under eye bags, use an under eye brightening concealer to fix that. Also, powder the T Zone only if you suffer from oily skin. If you don't, you can skip that step.
Bronzer is key for this look since she's very tan. Try using a matte bronzer, like Benefit Hoola or NYC Sunny, and put this where the sun naturally would tan your face. Use this along your cheeks, chin, hairline, temples, down your nose and blend down your neck, too. Use a shimmery bronzer, like one made by Wet N Wild or ELF, and put this onto the apples of your cheeks (like how you would apply blush), as Indiana has a very bronzy glow.
Indiana doesn't have very pronounced cheekbones, but she does have a slender nose. Contour with a light-medium matte brown eyeshadow along the sides of your nose as contour. Be sure to blend. To contour your face, use the same light-medium matte brown eyeshadow along your jawline. Doing this will give you Indiana's round face shape.
Indiana has more of a straight eyebrow in comparison to a soft-angled eyebrow. Indiana also has full eyebrows that are nicely groomed and have a natural arch to them, so be sure to keep your eyebrows groomed and not extremely hairy. Use an eyebrow pencil in a light brown shade to fill in your brows and blend in with a spoolie. Use clear mascara or eyebrow gel to comb through your brows and set everything into place.
Indiana's eye makeup look for the movie is really natural. She is wearing a lot of neutral colors. Begin by sweeping a light brown eyeshadow across the lid as your base color. Then, using a darker brown eyeshadow, and blend this color well into the crease. Next, line your lower lash line and tightline with brown eyeliner. Finally, line your waterline with white eyeliner to give your eyes a rounder shape.
To get Indiana's pout, line your lips with a pinky-nude lip liner. Go slightly over the border edge of the lips for the illusion of fuller lips. Fill in your lips with the lipliner. Then, use a nude lipstick with pink undertones and apply a clear lip gloss in the center of the bottom lip. The sexiest part of the lip is the cupid's bow. To highlight and enhance these little ""peaks,"" use a bit of highlighter above the center of your upper lip and draw in a ""V"" shape, just grazing each ""peak."" Apply more in the center of the ""V."" Then, blend delicately with the tip of the hard-angle brush. As for lipstick, one by Maybelline or Covergirl works best. Find one that suits you, personally.
Pop in some crystal blue colored contacts if you don't already have blue eyes.

, In the movie, it is simple and basic: a baby blue spaghetti strap tank top, blue long-sleeve button-up, blue swim top and bottoms, and denim shorts. She obviously chose the blue color scheme.


Later on in the movie, however, she attends prom. She is wearing a mid-thy length strapless white cocktail dress paired with a clutch and Strappy silver heels.

Master Trump’s facial expressions.",How to Look Like Donald Trump," Everyone knows that Donald Trump’s signature feature is his hair. Be careful what you ask for; you might end up looking like Trump, but not everyone agrees that’s a good thing. Trump’s hair has been the subject of many jokes!Trump’s hair is traditional. You won’t find him with long hair, a pony tail, a mullet, or anything like that. Trump wears his hair short. The White House press secretary accused Trump of having “fake hair” and others have accused him of getting a hair transplant. Is this true? No one really knows for sure.The fact is, though, that Trump’s hair focuses the audience’s attention on the front. That’s the key. You will never see a receding hairline on Trump (unless he’s caught in the wind, of course). His hair forms a full swoop that creates the illusion of fullness, which is associated by some with virility.;
, Put it in a ponytail on top of your head. Brush the rest of your hair into a ponytail under the first one. Note: The pony tail is not always necessary. Merely brushing your hair backwards is an option as well.Fluff it up by backcombing it with your brush.


Bring it onto your head. Stretch it out so it fits on both temples. Pin it in place. Backcomb the back ponytail, and pull it over your head so it looks toupee like. Pin it at the side to hold it in place. Flip the hair under and sweep it to the side.
Another way to get Trump’s hair is to blow dry the hair forward. Fold and blow the hair back and to the side. Then, sweep and blow the remaining hair to both sides.Essentially, the key to Trump’s hair is this: Hair from the side of the head has been rotated to the front to give him a thick hair line. It’s possible he’s had hair grafts.

, Trump’s hair is perpetually blonde. No matter how much he ages, his hair never turns fully gray or white, although he can sometimes be seen with whitened patches by the ears.


Keep your hair colored, and make it a blondish brown. Trump has admitted to using hairspray.Dye your eyebrows to match your hair. Some Trump impersonators bleach their eyebrows. Trump’s eyebrows are the same golden blonde as his hair. You will never see him with dark eyebrows.

, Some people think his complexion looks a bit orange. This effect is probably the result of a spray tan. The bottom line is that Trump never ventures out looking too pale.


To get the Trump orange-tan look, you could buy a self-tanning lotion at many stores. You need a little color to your skin if you want to truly look like Trump.
Trump impersonators say that Trump’s look is not as static as some people think and that the shade of his skin color constantly seems to change.
It's probably best to stick with a natural tan. Tanning booths can lead to side effects such as sunburns, skin cancer, and immune system suppression, because of the large amount of ultraviolet rays being shone onto your skin.

, Donald Trump knows advertising. He’s defined himself by a simple slogan, and he is often seen wearing a baseball cap that bears it.


This hat is the most easily definable trait of Trump. If you are seen wearing it, it’s likely that people will know immediately that it’s a Trump reference. Trump usually wears the hat in white or red.
You can buy the hat online on many sites. Whatever you think about him politically, most people agree that Trump understands marketing. He knows the power of a clear, memorable slogan, and this one is his.

, Trump uses “power colors.” He is usually seen in a suit and tie, and when he wears a tie, it’s often red. Some observers have noticed that, when Trump was on ""The Apprentice"" TV show, he usually wore a solid red tie. Then, he switched it up, sometimes wearing pink and yellow ties. Once he started running for president, the red tie came back.


You won’t find Trump in a bow tie, or anything non-traditional. If he doesn’t wear a red tie, you might find him in a blue one. Red ties connote authority and confidence, and also passion. Thus, if you’re trying to convey that you have a strong vision for a company, this is a good color to choose.You almost never find Trump wearing earth tones.
Trump wants his ties to stand out, so they are bright and bold colors. He gravitates toward solid ties and bright or dramatic colors. When he does wear a pattern, it is likely to feature horizontal stripes or tight geometric patterns. Trump’s ties are wide. He does not go for the skinny tie look. Also, he tends to have the tie hang lower than ties are typically worn, they often hang lower than the belt, and even as low as between his legs.

, This is signature Trump. The big power tie is a, shall we say it? A phallic symbol. To accentuate that point, Trump rarely buttons his jacket.


Trump’s suits are traditional. You will find him in a classic navy blue suit. You will find him in subtle pinstripes. He’s got the “businessman in the boardroom” look down pat. This was a look that Trump mastered on his television show “The Apprentice,” in which he was usually seen in a dark navy blue traditional suit with a power red tie without pattern.Trump’s suits are known to be somewhat boxy, and tend to run a little large. They are not overly tailored. He sticks to rich and neutral colors, such as charcoal gray or navy blue.
Trump's suits are made by the Italian company Brioni. Brioni manufactured all of his suits for the apprentice, and the vast majority of his suits during the election campaign. So if you want an authentic Trump look, you should use a Brioni suit.
When you see Trump in casual clothes, they are usually traditional and suitable for a golf course. You might see him in a monogrammed jacket with khaki slacks. His dress shirts are usually white.

, People have studied Trump’s speaking patterns in an attempt to isolate his appeal. And they have found some key patterns in how Trump talks.


Trump speaks in a slightly nasally tone. One Trump impersonator describes his vibe as “angry confidence.”The New York Times analyzed 95,000 words spoken by Trump and found a few constant patterns. For one, Trump often speaks in the collective voice, using the word “we,” and he often speaks directly to his audience, saying “you” in sentences.
The Washington Post analyzed 6,348 Trump tweets and found that 11 percent were insults and attacks and 89% consisted of self-promotion and bragging.His main targets were other political opponents.
Trump creates an unnamed or named supposedly dangerous “other,” creating dangerous imagery. He uses constant repetition, and his speech patterns tend to be very binary and devoid of nuance or gray areas., Trump’s speech patterns attack the person, not the idea or the situation. He frequently calls political opponents such condemning words as horrible, weak, or stupid. He uses adjectives heavily to make his point.


Trump focuses on emotional appeal, which Greek philosophers dubbed “pathos,” over an appeal to reason. Pathos is defined as an appeal to the emotions.
Ways to use pathos in speech patterns include making promises or commandments; expressing deep indignation; prophesying payback for ill doing; breaking off suddenly in the middle of speaking to convey emotion; and repetition of words to amplify thought and emotion., Trump uses power gestures. He uses gestures that convey authority and strength. He wants to show he’s “winning.” Trump “waves” a lot, using the gesture to say “go away, get out of here” said one impersonator.


For example, Trump uses his hands in an assertive fashion. He can often be seen giving a firm “thumb’s up” sign, for example.Another common gesture used by Trump is to punch the air with a single finger to emphasize a point while curling the rest of the hand into a fist.This is one of Trump’s most common gestures.It is called the “baton gesture,” and Bill Clinton often used a variation of it.

, Trump is a master at conveying emotions through facial gestures. Sometimes this backfires on him. There are entire memes created around Trump’s facial expressions.


Trump often turns his gaze into a squint. The goal here is to look serious and tough and like he is listening intently. Trump communicates with his body. He purses his lips when his opponents say something he doesn’t like. He turns his torso toward opponents to show he has no fear of them.Trump keeps his palms up when he gestures, a way of communicating openness. He leans forward when he is at a lectern, putting both hands on it as if he is doing a push up, which body language experts consider a power move. Trump nods and bobs his head a lot.
Trump often smiles, and when he does so, he rarely shows teeth. His smile is more of a Cheshire cat style grin. This implies that he has a secret; he possesses knowledge other people do not.Trump snarls when he wants to show disgust. He also rolls his eyes, shrugs and smirks a lot. These tactics derail questioners. "

Score perfect skin.,
Get in shape.,

Keep clean teeth.,
Be organised about your wardrobe.",How to Look Like Ashley Barnum from 'Perfect'," Ashley has blonde hair that ranges from light brown to almost white-blonde near her face. It's described as being 'surfer girl' hair, so you should try using the product 'surfer hair' by Garnier. She also has super-shiny and glossy hair, and it is revealed in the book that she rinses her hair with white vinegar so that it becomes shinier. Now this actually works, so consider it: you will need 1 part white vinegar mixed with three parts cold water. Give your hair a rinse with this mixture after shampooing and before conditioning.;
, Ashley is described as having absolutely no zits. She washes her face twice a day with a face wash. Consider purchasing a good cleanser, a great (and not too expensive) brand which will give good results, such as Neutrogena, Proactiv, Clean and Clear. All are available at drugstores. Note that if you wash your face MORE than twice a day the cleansers can seriously irritate and hence damage your skin. Ashley also has lightly tanned skin: you can use a tanning lotion or a spray tan. Note that it is dangerous to tan in the sunlight, even with sunscreen on.

, Ashley does two hours of aerobics in her basement, and has thighs that 'flex' instead of jiggle. If you do not want to pay for aerobics lessons, go to your local gym and check out machines like the treadmill, the cycle, and consider a personal trainer or any special offers or courses your gym may be having. Ashley is also the captain of the Field Hockey team. You could try field hockey, other good sports are also lacrosse, soccer and basketball.

, Ashley has a closet full of great things to wear. She especially loves jeans, and is described as having 'cool jeans'. Consider buying a few pairs for variety, such as skinny or bootcut. Bootcut jeans have the plus of looking longer and leaner. Since decent jeans are available at just about any clothing store, any brand should be fine as long as it fits right. Make sure you are comfortable and ensure that you can insert a finger at your hip with them on, even for the skinny variety. Too-tight jeans will give even the skinniest person a muffin top! The book doesn't say much about her actual clothes except that they're ""perfect"". But, I suggest stocking up on cute in style clothing.

Anything Cute That You Like!

, Ashley has perfect, straight, white teeth. Achieve this by brushing 2-3 times a day, flossing, rinsing with mouth wash, using a tongue scraper, and chewing whitening gum. Do not over brush, as this will scrape away the protective coating around your teeth.

, Ashley is noted to have a clean room with an organised wardrobe (and of course, perfectly white and sorted underwear and crisp, clean clothes). If you keep your wardrobe well, your clothes will turn out well, just as Ashley's do.

, Being healthy is much more important than being thin. If you are concerned about your weight, check with your doctor to find out your proper weight range. Follow your doctor’s recommendations to get to that healthy weight range and stay within it.

, Models’ diets vary widely and some of them are not healthy at all, so try not to focus on eating exactly like some models do.Instead, focus on making your diet as healthy as possible.


Begin your day with a healthy breakfast. Eggs, whole grain bread, fruit, oatmeal and yogurt are some of the many options that make up a great breakfast.
Eat a variety of foods, especially fruits and vegetables. To get the nutrients that you need to be healthy, eat plenty of fruits and veggies. Incorporate at least one serving of fruit or vegetables into each meal. Choose fruits and vegetables as snacks between meals as well.Choose lean proteins. Protein is important for good health, but you should choose proteins that will provide you with the most health benefits. Avoid fattier meats, such as pork and beef. Opt for leaner options instead, such as turkey and fish. Fish is a great choice because it also contains heart-healthy omega-3s.Choose whole grains. Steer clear of highly processed foods, such as white rice, white flour, white pasta and white bread. Instead, choose whole grain breads, whole wheat pastas, brown rice and whole wheat flour., Being well-hydrated is not only important for good health, it will also help to give your skin a glowing look. The amount of water that you need to drink each day is based on how much you weigh.


You should drink half an ounce to an ounce of water per pound, every day. If you weigh 160 pounds, you should drink between 80 and 160 ounces of water per day., To stay healthy and look great, you need to exercise on a regular basis. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise, such as walking, or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise, such as running. each week. This activity should be spread out over the course of the week, not done all at once. You should also aim for two strength training sessions per week to help keep your body toned.Keep in mind that most models work out much more than 150 minutes per week to maintain their stellar physiques. Some male models work out as much as 15 hours per week.Victoria's Secret models work out five times per week to maintain their thin physiques., Models have great smiles, so make sure to brush, floss, and use mouthwash twice daily to keep your teeth looking fabulous. If your teeth are not as white as you’d like them to be, consider whitening at-home treatments like special toothpastes, gels, and strips to give your teeth a model white gleam.To keep your teeth healthy and looking great, you should also get your teeth cleaned and checked by your dentist at least once per year. You should also go to see your dentist if your teeth or gums bother you.Follow your dentist’s recommendations for good dental care.

, The life of a model is stressful, so it is important to practice relaxation techniques to stay balanced. A bit of stress is normal and can even help motivate you. But too much stress is bad for your health and can even affect the way you look.Take time for yourself. Meditate, practice yoga or take a bubble bath. Just make sure that you make a little time for yourself every day.

, An important part of any date is clean teeth and sweet breath.

, A dab of perfume or cologne is nice. Definitely use some deodorant under your arms as nerves will probably make you sweat a bit. Don't wear too much perfume or cologne, or it will risk causing your date to gag. Always think what might happen if he or she hated the scent you've chosen!


If you have a strong perfume, spritz two puffs of perfume in the air in front of, close your eyes, wait 5 seconds, and then walk through the puffs of perfume.

, If you're not sure where you'll be going, dress smart casual. Some other ideas are:


Going for a dance: For girls: Dark wash skinny jeans, paired with wedge heels, a pastel tank top and a flirty shrug/cropped cardigan. Accessorize with sterling stud earrings and a charm bracelet. For guys: Neat jeans (chinos are good), t-shirt or shirt and nice shoes.

Walk tall and stand straight; good posture works wonders!,

If you're lucky enough to have an hourglass figure, work that bootylicious behind and those great boobs!

",How to Look Gorgeous and Work Your Curves," Stand in front of a full length mirror and check out how your underwear fits. Does it cut into your skin? Are you spilling out of your bra left, right and center? Or, conversely, do you have straps that constantly slip down, or gappy cups? Even if you think your underwear fits perfectly, be sure to follow the next step, as we can never be sure! Now that you're down to your bra and pants, have a good look at yourself. What kind of figure do you have? Are you a voluptuous hourglass? A pear shape with gorgeous, womanly hips and a bum to die for? An apple, all bosomy with broad shoulders but with slim hips? Or perhaps you have the banana body shape, straight up and down, slim hips and not a lot up top? Once you've confirmed your body shape, you want to pick out the parts of your body you like. Perhaps a pear shaped lady will want to flaunt that gorgeous bottom. Focus on your best parts.;
, Get yourself measured to find out what bra size you are to ensure you are wearing the right size. If you wear the wrong size, your breasts will suffer and will most certainly not look as good as they would if you wore the right size of bra.

, Now, if you are reading this article, you are probably one of those women with gorgeous curves who hate their shape and wear boring knickers and those awful white bras with no support or shape to them. Go for some color like decadent ivory, sexy black, or playful pink. Enjoy yourself while shopping for lingerie, it's not a chore! Pick out lacy creations, you want to feel sexy. Try bras with detailing and bows and other lovely additions, again making sure you're buying the right size. Make sure you buy a bra that suits your bust (But the trusty balconette bra looks great on everybody!) ; if you have a fuller bust, you want something under-wired with lots of support. Something plunging looks fabulous on a busty lady. If you have a smaller bust, you perhaps want an uplift bra, or a bra with padding, a proper cleavage enhancer! At the end of the day, just make sure that your bra fits well, matches your knickers and makes you feel sexy! And please remember, if you're a woman with tremendous breasts, this is an area where you can spend, spend, spend!

, Try on your sexy new lingerie. Take a good look, see how great it makes you look and feel, see how sexy you are. Love yourself. Define what parts of yourself you like the most. Perhaps you've got a luscious pout. If that's the case, you want to keep your teeth in great condition (You should be doing that anyway!) and you should spend an extra minute in your daily routine to slick on a little lip gloss. Draw attention to your mouth and don't be afraid to experiment with lip color! You might, however, feel that you have the most gorgeous eyes! Here, you should keep your eyes clear and dewy with eye drops, ensure that your make-up is properly cleaned off at night. Make the most of your eyes! Be sure to get plenty of sleep, as you don't want dark circles or bloodshot peepers bringing you down! You might want to invest in having your eyelashes tinted, this can save you a fortune on mascara and really brings out your eyes. Also be sure that you keep your eyebrows well-groomed and perhaps even start experimenting with eye make-up. Work black liquid eyeliner with feline flicks, or sparkling shadows. Avoid fake eyelashes as they can make your look harsh, and will give off a lack of confidence as they are usually obviously fake. Whatever you do, once you've identified your best parts, make sure you take a little extra time to make your best parts stand out and look good!

, Make sure you're well-looked after. Take care of your skin, keep your hair nourished, wax when and where required, but get your bikini line done professionally, just basically treat your body to a good old spoiling. Invest in gorgeous smelling body lotions, exfoliate regularly, always clean your make-up off at night, cleanse and tone! Just be sure to keep yourself in tip-top condition. The fact that you spend a lot of time making yourself look good makes others see that you are worth that time, and also is a great help when you're out on the town or just seducing your man indoors (In your sexy new undies, obviously.). This will boost your self-confidence, as you'll be proud of how good you look!

",How to Look Good With Little to No Makeup," Clear, healthy skin will give you more confidence, as well as removing the need for foundation or concealer.



Determine your skin type. You must do this before taking action to improving your skin so that you can choose the appropriate products, and so that you know what problems you have to tackle, and how to treat them.

Develop a good skin care routine which is suitable for your type of skin. It's important to stick to a routine as strictly as you can, this is because it can take a while for the routine to start improving the appearance of your skin, and can sometimes take time for your skin to adjust to the new things you are doing to it.

Generally you should include: a gentle day to day cleanser, a twice weekly exfoliating facial scrub, an appropriate daily moisturizer, treatment for when spots pop up, and a face mask to use once a week/whenever needed.


Don't be too harsh on your skin. Try to avoid strong products, and choose natural or sensitive products instead to prevent your skin from becoming irritated or dry. You could even try out DIY methods by making your own face masks to avoid harmful chemicals.
If you have any specific problems, such as acne or scars, then it's recommended that you approach a specialist such as a dermatologist or your doctor to help you to develop a treatment that is right for you.;
, A soft, plump pout looks nice and kissable, but dry chapped lips can look scruffy and unhealthy. Moisturize your lips with some balm before bed, (stay away from very cheap brands as they can cause your lips to become even more dry in the long term), and exfoliate your lips every now and again to keep them smooth, (don't bother spending money on special products, sugar works fine). Also, avoid smoking, and drink plenty of water to keep your pout looking good.

, A good set of brows can frame and flatter your face. Plucking is the easiest and cheapest way to shape them, just be careful to stand back from the mirror every now and again to make sure that they're even and that you're not over-plucking. If you're not brave enough to do them yourself, eyebrow shaping is widely available and fairly affordable, you could get the professionally plucked, waxed or threaded. This is definitely one of the most important steps to natural beauty as it helps to give your face more definition.

, Get a new haircut that frames and flatters your face shape. A good haircut can help to define your best features. To go with your natural theme, choose a natural-looking, easy to style, haircut, relaxed waves and loose curls are good styles that look natural while still looking pretty and feminine, as well as giving your hair life and volume. Try wearing your hair as it naturally dries, or style it to enhance it's natural shape. Experiment with it - making the effort with it will stop you feeling 'boring'!

, By making sure that you get enough vitamins and minerals in your diet, the goodness in your diet will show in your skin and hair, as well as making you feel good and healthy. Drinking plenty of water is important as it helps to flush out harmful toxins which can cause you to break out, it also keeps your skin and hair well hydrated resulting in less dryness and a better glow.

,


Try tinted moisturizer if you want some cover up, but want to avoid foundation. It'll help to even out your skin tone and tone down any blemishes which you may be feeling self-conscious about, without looking as if you are wearing a cover up product, and without and caking or streaks.

Mascara is a great way of making your eyes look bigger and more awake. Many girls consider mascara to be their make-up necessity as it defines your eyes, widens them, and emphasizes the length of the eyelashes which makes the eye appear more feminine. Opt for a brown/clear mascara, (preferably a lengthening brand rather than a volumizing one to avoid clumping), and apply one or two coats to your upper lashes, and one quick coat to the bottom lashes. If you have fairly straight eyelashes, you may want to curl them for better emphasis without adding any more products.
Blush should be chosen by using a colour which is similar to the colour your cheeks go when you pinch them lightly, (click here for more advice on choosing blusher for your skin tone) . To apply the blush use a fluffy brush and sweep onto the apples of your cheeks to give your face more of a glow and to make you look less washed out. If you have a golden skin tone, or if it is summer, a bronzer may be more appropriate, and this should be applied in the contours of your cheeks (beneath the apples).
Lipstick or lip gloss shouldn't be necessary if your lips are well looked after, but if you would like a bit more colour or definition on your lips, then you could either go for a nude lip, or a slightly rosy coloured lip stain. You could get away with a pale or clear lip gloss, and still look naturally pretty, because the rest of your face is so minimal.

, Choose jewellery to suit your outfit, and paint your nails, or even try false nails to make you feel that extra bit beautiful.

Smile.",How to Look Good on a Limited Budget," Most of the time stores are having sales to get rid of clothes that are not selling or just to make way for the new clothes. Shopping for deals is good. Always be sure to check out your local thrift store, like Goodwill or Salvation Army. If you're a humanitarian, pay it forward and donate your nice-looking, unused clothes.;
, Remember to return them, unless they let you keep them.

, The cut of a piece of clothing is intrinsic to how good you'll look. If you know your body shape (pear, hourglass, ruler, etc.), dress based on the shape. For pear, highlight your top and minimize your bottom. For hourglass, highlight your waist, and it will emphasize your top and bottom. For ruler, you can wear just about anything in regards to bold patterns and statement pieces like maxi dresses and long, baggy sweaters.

, If you can't afford it or don't have the time, put on fingernail polish. Clear nail polish works well with white to make a gorgeous French manicure. Alternatively, the next time you go to the salon, get a simple manicure (instead of solar nails or acrylics) and pay close attention to the process and tools they use. Learn how to give yourself a professional manicure at home.

, When showering, use cool or cold water to wash your hair to make it shinier. Use shampoo and conditioner when washing your hair and shower once a day. Most people should not wash their hair every day or it will dry out. However, if your hair looks or feels dirty the day after you wash it, you may need to wash it every day. Mayonnaise wonderfully hydrates the hair. Use it as a hair masque once a month.

, Once again, shop the sales! If there are shoes you like and you know they will look good with at least three or five outfits, then they are worth getting, if possible. But if you see shoes that are cute and you don't think you will wear them, don't get them. It makes no sense getting shoes or purses that are cute and have them sit in your closet forever before you use them again. Purses are like little carrying cases for girls! A place where you can get a deal on purses is TJ Maxx.There they cost at least $200 lower. But if you hit a sale they will go down at least 10% or 30%.

, Wash your face and brush your teeth two times a day. Wash your hands after going to the bathroom, playing outside, and touching money. After putting makeup on you should wash your face too.

, Make sure the windows have no spider webs in them or dust. Mop and vacuum the floors and carpet. Dust the TV and the shelves. Keep your house organized and smelling fresh., Have you ever seen rich people wearing pearls? Well, you can make your own pearl-looking necklace or bracelet. Go to a bead store and look for these white round beads that look like pearls. Than bead them and wear them whenever you want. Big jewelry in? Not to rich people. More of the classic jewelry is in than the modern.

, And gift cards.

, Anyone can afford a happy, healthy smile. Not only will it make you look better, but it'll make you feel better inside.

",How to Look Great At Any Age," This includes:

Checking your nails. See what you need to do. Maybe you need to file them or trim them or even paint them.



 


Looking at your hair. Check if you have split ends. If you do, that's a big ""no no"" unless it looks really hot, but if you have dry brittle ends get them cut at once. If they're greasy, maybe it's time to take a shower.
Looking at your skin. Bumpy, dry skin just won't do. After you take a shower always put lotion on, you can't really prevent bumpy red skin. Try to moisturize your skin 3 times a day. To prevent acne, use acne prevention washes. If you do have acne, do the required treatments eg wash face with an acne face-wash daily etc. Refer to your dermatologist.;
,


Fix your nails.
File them with a nail filer.
Trim them.
Find some lotion of any kind and massage some on your nails.

Take a shower, then ruffle your hair and apply hairspray for a dangerous, sexy look.
If you want a more sassy look, take a shower and comb your hair straight but at the ends of your hair, curve it.

Medium hair is a good choice!



A cute style is to get or a buy a small curling iron.
Let it heat up, then curl it, but not just any curl, a spiral twist.
Twist your hand a bit to the right or left and apply hairspray.




Long, dangerous hair. Long hair is the secret to excellence. The hottest styles are wavy and spiral twist.



A fast and simple way to wavy hair is braids, before you go to bed simply do 2 braids, or one, or 2 French braids, or all over.
The easiest way to get a spiral twist is to do the same as for medium.





, Blonde hair might go well with a tan, and light brown hair can also go with a tan. If you have dark brown hair, get a light tan. Red hair with light skin,no tan. Black hair with a tan or light skin might be an idea.

, Never ever not smell good. Now if you don't shave already now start (if your age 9-14 get permission)A way to make skin improve greatly, use skin lavender baby oil, this makes your skin smell good and look shiny and sexy.

, If you want a more mature look, go for black eyeliner. If you want a cute, sassy look, go for a brown eyeliner. Now apply some mascara and eye shadow. Choose what color best suits you. Have fun, and good luck!

This will brighten them up by constricting the blood vessels. If your face gets so numb you can't stand it, have 30 second intervals.;
, The color brings a vitality to your pucker, unlike nudes, which can make you look corpse-like. Bring along some of the gloss because its likely to dry out quickly if you're sick.

, In the mean time just use cover up!

, This should make you look happy and healthy, even if you aren't. So keep on grinning!

, This makes you a happier and can reduce the grumbling sound that people hear in the middle of class.

, Try snow peas or something that will ""invigorate"" you. Don't get into the ""I'm sick so I can eat what I want,"" mood. It will make you feel guilty and its not healthy. Eat healthily (or as well as possible) and you'll get better quicker.

A half-button down shirt, layered over any polo, with a jacket on top, is always a good look - simply match similar collars so that bottom one shows and folds over a bit. Jeans are a winter staple, as are comfortable boots. If you're outdoors in the cold, always have a coat on!;
, Stock up on stylish winter boots, uggs, sneakers, slippers, sweatpants, jeans, sweatshirts, leg warmers, sweaters, leggings, tights, and hats!

, In case of a cold winter, a coat becomes a girl's best friend. It's the item of your wardrobe you'll be wearing most of the time so be sure to find a good one. Choose one that will both prevent you from the cold and reflect your personal style!


If you're into vintage, invest in a cute 60's coat. Or what about a comfy, classy jacket in the American pilot fashion? Whatever your choice is, make sure it's warm enough. A woolen cardigan is a pretty piece of clothing but it won't be of much use when it's snowing outside.
A padded jacket is always a popular choice. If you opt for it, try to find a light one to avoid the 'padded' effect. Even the light models are pretty warm, these days. And pick a lively color.

, Extremities are vulnerable, specially in bad weather. Make sure they are protected so no part of your body will be exposed to the cold air. Otherwise, you'll feel cold all over.


Build a bundle of warmth, starting with something on your head. A woolen bonnet is the ideal choice, but if you're not mad about it, a cap, a beret or a large hat will still do pretty well.
Cover your neck with a scarf: it is elegant, and you can learn to do some fancy ties.
Don't forget your hands, they're easily dry and hurt during wintertime. If you're tired of traditional gloves, find some in imitation leather. They're usually cheap and very classy-looking.

, Boots are a must. They can be either high or low, with all sizes of heels, colors, chains, laces and so on.

, Nothing better than a few added touches to jazz up a classical outfit. When you can't go out without your snow boots and a scarf around your face, make the most of pretty necklaces––long ones will look specially fitting on a pull-over- of flowers in your hair, colorful watches and bracelets, earrings, cute handbags, etc.


Tights are a most precious accessory; they're both pretty and warm. When they are thin, they will look great on your legs. If you have to wear them thick, pick a lively color.

, Now you're protected by your coat and other warm accessories, you can allow yourself to wear fancy and light clothes underneath.


In wintertime, some people prefer to wear warm clothes and light coats, but doing the reverse will enable you not only to show off your wardrobe but also to avoid temperature shocks. The trick is to wear several layers, so you'll be able to take some off and feel comfortable whatever the temperature is.
Besides, you can recycle some of your summer clothes, such as your thickest summer dresses with a pull-over and warm tights. You can also put on skirts or jeans with short sleeves tops or blouses and warm it all up with a sweater.
As for your underwear, have fun with cute and elegant things. Even if nobody sees them, knowing you're wearing them will boost your self-confidence and your attractiveness.

, In the winter, with harsh winds and heating on full-blast, most skin types will dry out quickly. Drink plenty of water and apply oil-free, easily absorbed light lotions to all parts of your body. Use lip balm to keep from suffering from chapped lips.

, Though showering daily is considered good taste, many have found that they should wash their hair using products every other day, or even less! The reasoning behind this is simple: washing your hair strips it of it's natural oils, causing it to dry out and split ends to form - a problem amplified by the winter. Leave in a moisturizing conditioner or hair mask on the last 3 to 5 inches (7.6 to 12.7 cm) of your hair for about 15 minutes, once a week in order to keep it soft. Also, brush hair from the scalp to the tips, to spread the natural oils. This does nothing but strengthen your hair and give it a silky feel.

, For the face, lighten or forgo foundation completely, and use a rosy, warm pink on your cheeks. Mixing a tiny dusting of bronzer with your blush can be a good maneuver, but either look lovely.

, Consider ""going bare"" at the eyes; a quick layer of charcoal mascara on your upper lashes, and no eyeliner. This serves to brighten and enlarge your eyes. Cream eye-shadows are also good winter choices: unlike during the summer, they will not ""melt off"". Colors in the pale blues, whites, and gray-blues are lovely ways to adjust your makeup to the cooler months - daub a bit of white toward the inner corner of your eye, and blend outward with a light blue.


Alternatively, jumbo eye-pencils in metallics are another option. Use whites, golds or silvers to achieve a frosty beauty with a tapering line barely above the top lashes. Lightly apply to the bottom of the eyes, then, using the sides of your index fingers, push up until it is a thin line.

, Use chapstick religiously. Apply every ten to twenty minutes, or as needed. Cracked lips are unattractive. Any kind will suffice, in a pinch, even Vaseline. It is light and leaves your lips feeling much softer.


Natural beauty is never beaten. Very rarely does anything top a quick daub of lip-gloss and a freshly washed face.

, Winters are hard on people: long nights, not much sunshine. It's not an easy task to look bright and fresh every day. Get a lot of sleep and when you're unable to do it, take advantage of the weekend and get some rest.


Try to enjoy the sun when you can find some!- and fill the lack of it by taking vitamin D. Add vitamin C for energy!
Cure your colds with adequate remedies and by staying warm.

, Healthy doesn't mean boring, protected and cloistered. Keep up with some exercise and go for walks, go downtown and hang out with your friends, try not giving up on your hobbies...


Maintain a social life. Winter is a tiring season, so make compromises. For instance, having a fun going out on Saturday and staying in on Sunday will keep you both rested and happy.
Enjoy the winter pleasures––snowballs fights, winter sports, Christmas shopping, etc. Try to stay in an optimistic state of mind. Don't forget: a happy person shows her beauty on her face and will glow through the coldest winters!

Treat your umbrella like an accessory.",How to Look Good on a Rainy Day1," The trench coat is a classic piece that works well for nearly any woman's wardrobe. A coat with a hood will provide you with added protection from the rain, but even a trench coat without a hood can work if you plan on carrying an umbrella. Consider a standard beige trench, a sophisticated burgundy trench, or a vibrant red trench, depending on your personality.;
, A double-breasted coat flatters many women, but women with larger busts should consider a single-breasted coat, instead. Additionally, belted coats look lovely on girls who want to define their waist and show of their curves.

, Materials like cashmere and thin cotton weaves work best under a well-fitted coat since they do not add extra bulk. Conversely, you should avoid heavy wool sweaters and over-sized garments. These pieces may make you look lumpy beneath your coat.

, When the weather is gray and cloudy, your spirits naturally sink. Adding bright, cheerful colors to your wardrobe is a good way to keep your spirits high. Choose colorful coats and umbrellas to add a splash of color to your rainy day attire..

, Outerwear and accessories in black, chocolate, or deep red create a sophisticated appearance. If a boost to your confidence is enough to lift your mood on a rainy day, stick with neutral or subdued colors that give your appearance a mature twist.

, Brightly colored rubber boots can give off a childish vibe, especially if they are speckled in daisies, polka dots, or other loud prints. If you want to wear a colored rain boot, opt for bold, solid colors over patterns. Alternatively, a rubber riding boot or a leather boot with a waterproof coating can give your look a sophisticated edge.

, Do not carry any bags in this material or wear any shoes made with this material. Unprotected leather can also get ruined in the rain.

, Look for a bright color or pattern to liven up the dreariness outdoors, or opt for a chocolate brown or red umbrella with a wooden handle for a mature, chic look. Have fun with it, and choose an umbrella that suits your personality.

Tie your hair back.,
Try braiding your hair.,
Use anti-frizz serum or hairspray.,
Slick your hair back with gel.,
Wear waterproof mascara, eye liner, and eyeshadow.,
Apply liquid foundations and cream blushes instead of powders.,
Keep your make-up light.",How to Look Good on a Rainy Day2," Odds are, the moisture in the air will make it difficult to style your hair in any elaborate manner. Keeping your hair down may even prove difficult if you have hard to manage locks, since humidity may cause frizz and hard-to-tame waves. Reduce this effect by tying your hair back in a clean, slick ponytail. It may still get frizzy if you do not use any styling products to keep it down, but the amount of frizz will likely seem less noticeable.

, Braids add an extra layer of structure into your style, which may further reduce unruly frizz. Wear two tightly braided pigtails for a playful, youthful look, or try one large braided ponytail down your back to create a dressier appearance.

, Whether you have your hair down or tied back, hair care products like these are a rainy day necessity. Anti-frizz serum is especially usefully in taming fly-away frizz caused by the humidity. Hairspray may not be necessary for casual styles, but if you want your hair to stay put, you should definitely consider a quick spritz.

, If you have short hair, ponytails and braids are not exactly an option you can take advantage of. For a fuss-free rainy day style, slick your hair back with gel. This keeps your hair styled, frizz-free, and in place while giving it a wet appearance that nullifies the desire to keep your hair dry.

, Mascara can look especially bad once it runs, so waterproof mascara is an absolute necessity on a rainy day. Eye liner and eyeshadow can also run and get in your eyes once wet, so you should look for waterproof versions of these, as well.

, Liquid cosmetics do not wash away as easily as powders, so your make-up will last longer. Additionally, liquids and creams do not streak as easily as powders do upon getting wet.

, The less you can get away with wearing, the better. No matter what products you apply, there is still some chance that they will run or wear off. If you feel comfortable skipping make-up for a day, go for it. Otherwise, keep your make-up application at a bare minimum, only opting for a light coating of the products you feel are “must haves” in your daily beauty routine.

Consider your lifestyle and what you really need. When you’re sticking to a budget, the crucial element in making the most of your appearance is to take a look at your real life and what types of clothing and beauty treatments your real life requires. Just because those red leather, $175 sling-back high heels look amazing doesn’t mean you buy them, especially if you work in landscaping and rarely wear a dress, if you'll wreck gel nails within a week, don't bother and if you swim a lot, a high maintenance hairstyle might not suit. Be practical.Work from the principle of the item’s Return on Investment (ROI), even if it’s a pair of $3 earrings. How often will you wear them? With how many outfits can you wear them? How long will they last?;
, Unless you have a pile of cash hidden or a nice tax return has just been deposited into your bank account, remember that building a wardrobe won’t happen overnight. You want to slowly acquire basic and versatile pieces at the cheapest price possible, while looking ahead and asking yourself: “Will this still be wearable in a couple of years?”


Shop out of season. Shop for spring and summer items in the fall and winter and vice versa. Perusing the sales racks for items that can be worn in the opposite season than your in, can result in great bargains. Keep in mind that your bargain may be out of style come the season you'll wear it. Avoid extremes of fashion if being in style is important to you.Hit the outlet stores where major retailers offload overstock, which the stores sell at reduced prices. Be careful, though, because sometimes items have defects.Shop at discount stores like Marshall’s and TJ Maxx, where retailers also offload their overages. You can often find good deals on purses, shoes and accessories. They also regularly have huge clearance sales around the holidays and the end of the season., Instead, choose selectively, going for quality over quantity. Just like shopping at outlet and discount stores, rein yourself in at all other stores, too. Just because something is on sale for $19.99 doesn’t mean you need it, or that you should buy it. That $19.99 might as well be $100 if you’re living on a really tight budget. If it doesn’t play a versatile role in your overall wardrobe, if you can’t see yourself wearing it in a couple of years and if you’re iffy about it, put it back.Always think about quality over quantity. It’s much better to buy a $65 pair of jeans and have them tailored to fit perfectly than to buy two pairs of $30 jeans that sag in the butt and are too long., When we hear, “You simply must start with the basics,” we often think, “Okay, here comes the boring shopping.” Basics don’t have to be boring. Instead, they have to be versatile, solid-colored pieces that form the foundation of your wardrobe. The more versatile they are, the further you can stretch your wardrobe. Many such items are far from boring, being made in a variety of cuts, materials and textures that can be mixed and matched.


For instance, pairing different textures like jersey with lace or silk with wool takes the basics from bland to brilliant.
Mixing textures also doesn’t break the beauty tenet that simple is more, or better. This concept is great when you’re styling on a budget because dressing simply doesn’t have to cost much. It only needs to be put together well.
The basic of the basics typically includes: a black dress; white button-down, fitted blouse; short-sleeved white t-shirt; well-fitted blazer; khaki pants; fitted jeans; solid-colored pantsuit or skirt/jacket combo for work, if needed; and a pair of both black flats and solid-colored tennis shoes. What you need m a y be radically different., After you have the basic basics, you will need to gradually add more. Stick to one or two color families for your basics and build from there. For example, neutrals – black, brown, grey, tan, navy and some would say white – are the colors for basics for a reason. They go with just about everything, including each other. Sticking to one or two will allow you to not only mix them with each other but also to only buy pieces that color-coordinate with your base palettes. Make sure you don’t buy anything that won’t go with at least two-three other items you already have!
Color-coordinating is pretty easy. Look online at a color wheel. To find the complementary color of the item you want to wear, look directly across the color wheel to the other side. The color you see is your item’s complementary color. Looking good can involve looking bold and unconventional. Pair any colors you like.The colors on each side of the complementary color are the semi-complimentary colors and can also be worn, one at a time if you are very conventional and boring. Remember, there are no fashion police in real life.You can wear navy suits or blue shirts with brown leather shoes and belts if you like. Brown is closest to orange/red-orange, which is across from blue on the color wheel. You may no yt? Look good in this outfit at the beach or working on your garden., Often the difference between cheap and expensive clothes is the fabric used and the cut, which makes more expensive clothing look sleek and form fitting. One way to make up for this is by wearing spanx and other shapewear. Another difference is that expensive clothing is often lined, whereas cheaper clothing often is not. This can make a big difference in the overall appearance of a piece. A quick fix is by wearing a slip under your dress or skirt, for instance, or a sheer camisole under a shirt.


Another option is to have your clothing tailored. This would be best if you found an expensive but timeless basic at a hugely discounted price that wasn’t quite the right size or fit. It’s also a good option for minor adjustments to an item you spent a bit more on for the sake of quality over quantity.

, Accessorizing with jewelry, scarves, headbands, shoes, purses, watches and so forth might be the most important thing you can do to look great on a budget, as long as it’s not overdone! Classic accessories can be worn many times, in many ways and with many different outfits. They add to your basics, pulling everything together. They can transform essentially the same outfit from one event or occasion to another, such as from work to dinner.


They can also elevate a cheap look to a more expensive look. For instance, don a pair of cubic zirconium stud earrings with a simple black dress when real diamonds aren’t in your budget.
Avoid fake leather, too much plastic and overly shiny metals. They look cheap. Instead go for canvas, wood and brushed or matte metals.
Buy a smaller number of interestingly designed pieces, even if they’re a bit pricier, rather than a lot of accessories that are essentially interchangeable., You can add color in ways other than through accessorizing to add some wow-factor to your base palette. This is where blazers, coats, sweaters, cardigans, wraps, bright shirts and tank tops, colorful or patterned tights, etc. come into play. Much of the method relies upon layering to add color, ensuring that the colors coordinate or don’t overpower the outfit.


Color-coordinate by using analogous colors. Take the color of the piece you’re wearing, look on the color wheel at the color to the left and the color to the right of the original. These are the analogous colors. Choose one and use it to coordinate with your original.
Sometimes you are in situations where you need a more subdued look. In these cases, add one accent color to your neutral palette. For example, wear a black skirt and tailored jacket, black heels and add an embellished, emerald-colored top under the jacket. Pair it with faux pearl and black-beaded earrings., Now that you have your basics, accessories and additional items to add color and texture, work on mixing and matching your wardrobe. You’ll be amazed at how many outfits you can put together with a relatively small amount of clothes and accessories. For example, a simple blue dress can be made ready for a cocktail party with the right pair of high heels and jewelry. Or you can throw a sweater over it, transforming it into a skirt, and pull on some boots for an afternoon lunch.


Remember that shoes play a vital role in making your wardrobe more versatile, but you don’t need a ton of shoes to do it. Make the shoes themselves become versatile. A pair of tall, brown leather boots can be dressed up or down, for instance.

, Even less expensive clothes, which tend to fade and shrink, will last longer and maintain their color, shape and quality better with proper care. Make sure you read the labels and wash your clothes as instructed. If it says to dry clean, don’t wash it! Generally, always wash clothes with like colors. Wash dark colors in cold, so they won’t fade as quickly. Buy a drying rack to air dry your clothes as much as possible to reduce shrinking, or tumble dry clothes on low heat. Never rub stains; instead blot the stain with cool water and then use a stain remover before washing.


Consider using RIT dye when your black clothes have faded a lot, which can happen quickly.
Another way to always look put together is to simply iron your clothes before wearing them.
Polishing your shoes regularly will do wonders, too. If you have an expensive pair of shoes that are in great condition except for the soles, have them resoled.
Learn basic sewing and mending techniques, and keep extra buttons, thread and needles for basic repairs., Looking good also includes having some form of hairstyle that looks purposeful. Getting your hair professionally done on a regular basis, however, can be very expensive. Ask your stylist if he or she will do your hair from home, which some will do inexpensively because salons pocket about 60% of the overall fee.Ask if there’s a junior stylist with lower rates at your salon. Look into stylists who work from home; for new salons in town with Grand Opening discounts; at the beauty school; and at the barber’s shop, where you can save a bundle on simple cuts.Have a friend or family member cut your hair and dye it yourself. Or get a salon or barbershop cut and dye it yourself. Try semi-permanent color your first time.
Check out salon loyalty programs, in which you get a free service after a certain number of visits and the like.

, First, skip the clarifying shampoo and, instead, every six weeks mix 1 tablespoon of baking powder with 2 tablespoons of white vinegar, work it into your hair and rinse to get rid of build-up. Don’t do this after dyeing your hair, or it will strip the color. Secondly, exchange expensive shampoos for baby shampoo. Also, wash and condition your hair on alternating days. Finally, to bring out shine, mix a ¼ cup of lemon juice with 1 cup of warm water and pour it over your hair after you’ve washed it for lighter-colored hair. For darker hair, use a ¼ cup of white vinegar and 1 cup of warm water.In general, use half of all additional products. Logically, you don’t need a volumizing shampoo and conditioner, mouse and root booster if you still have to tease your hair.

, You don’t have to buy expensive makeup to still look great wearing it. There are a lot of good, yet cheap drugstore products. The key to having nice make-up is in knowing what colors to use and how to apply it. Start by heading to a department store’s makeup section and see if you can get a makeover. Another option is to find good tutorials on YouTube.


When buying make-up, go for the drugstore products first. Stock up on them when stores have buy one, get one free deals, which happens regularly.
If you do splurge on a product, make sure it’s something that’s going to help your skin’s appearance like foundation or concealer, not lipstick or eyeshadow., Well-groomed nails are an important part of the whole package. Rough, discolored or unfiled nails can spoil an outfit that’s otherwise in tip-top shape – perfectly accessorized, color-coordinated, polished and pressed. Luckily, you can correct most nail problems yourself with a pair of clippers and a nail file. Add a top coat for some shine. If you want to add color, apply a base coat, two layers of color and then a top coat. If you do these things and keep your cuticles well moisturized with lotion, you can save a bundle by not having them done at a salon.

, If you’re willing to sift through racks of clothes you won’t want, you’ll find many hidden gems in thrift stores. Amazing leather coats for $25. Cashmere sweaters for $5. The perfect Ralph Lauren wool pantsuit for $8 that you can wear to work. Sometimes, especially in the more posh parts of town, you’ll even find price tags still on clothes. They’re also a great place to find shoes, purses, scarves, jewelry, slips, belts, ties and hats.Some stores have discount days, and often there’s a discount of some kind every day. Call and ask before you go. Value Village, if there's one near you, for instance, gives you 20% off everything you buy that day if you donate just one item when you walk in. The discounts vary by organization.

, Fashion consignment shops are usually smaller, local establishments that tend to sell designer clothing that’s in good condition. The selection is much smaller than at thrift stores, but it’s more focused. The prices are higher than at thrift stores, but you can be in and out quickly. The same cannot be said when you go thrift shopping.

, The best bargains on designer clothing, shoes, beauty products and accessories may be on Overstock.com. You do actually save money, and there is a lot from which to choose. The company offers a variety of discounts throughout the year as well as a discount for becoming a member. You can also shop online on eBay. Look for items that aren’t being marketed well, that have poorer-quality photographs or that are mislabeled. This often means they’re not being sold by a professional eBay seller, so they’ll often get fewer bids and be cheaper.Look closely at the terms of the MasterCard associated with Overstock.com. You have to spend a lot on the card to earn points, and the savings may not end up paying the interest on the card purchases.
A downside to both is you can’t try things on first, and getting refunds from eBay purchases can be tricky.

, Also called upcycling, refashioning clothes has become quite popular in the last decade. It involves taking old articles of clothing or fabrics and altering them to create something new. You might resize, add embellishments or cut articles apart and sew them together to create a new piece. Use your old clothes, thrift-store clothing, pieces of fabric, blankets, etc. You can also make accessories from a variety of materials., Gather friends together, have everyone bring clothing items and accessories they don’t wear often and start trading. Most people, even those with tight budgets, have nice things hiding in the backs of their closets for lack of wear. Even if a friend has something that’s not a perfect fit, refashion it, take it in yourself or see a tailor. Finish your clothes swapping with a fashion show!"

If it's naturally wavy, try straightening your hair to transform your look. It sounds too easy, but a simple change in hair texture can completely change the way your face looks. Here are a few popular styles to try:


Long, beachy waves
Pin-straight hair
Bouncy curls;
, If everyone else you know has long, tousled waves, maybe it's time to do something different. Consider cutting your hair in a chic, short style that will help you stand out from the crowd and look far more exotic than your peers. The fact that you were bold enough to cut your hair short will lend a mysterious air to your personality. Here are a few great short looks to consider:Classic pixie cut
Rockerish faux hawk
Blunt bob

, If you have dark hair, try going blond for a look that's exotic to you. If your hair is fair, dye it dark brown or even black. Changing your hair color is one of the best ways to add an element of the exotic to your look. No matter what your natural hair color is, dyeing it a different color will instantly make you feel different.


You could also dye your hair a bold color. There's always something exotic about a midnight black or a peroxide blonde, but what about red with a streak of purple or strawberry blonde with pink tips?
Or go for the popular ombre look, with hair that fades from dark to light, or vice versa.

, Extensions are a great way to change your look in a heartbeat. With super long hair, the options are virtually endless. You could also get extensions that aren't your hair color or go for a dip-dyed or ombre look. And if you go the temporary route (the kind that just clips in), you can experiment until you find a look you love.


Extensions are hard to maintain. Think about how much work you want to put into your look before you go dishing out some cash for the extra hair.
They're also damaging to hair if they aren't put in correctly, so make sure you see an experienced stylist.

, Hair wraps, feathers, beads, and other pretty accessories will make your hair look different from everyone else's. If you're looking for an easy option, find clip-ins to add to your tresses.

, No matter the shape of your eyes, black winged eyeliner will instantly add interest and mystery to your face. Winged eyeliner makes your eyes look bigger and more interesting, and it's a fun look to rock for a night out. Winged eyeliner can be hard to pull off if you don't have the steady hand of a makeup artist, so try this method for applying it flawlessly:Get a tube or pot of dark black eyeliner. This works better with liquid eyeliner than with a pencil.
Take a piece of tape and place it right under your bottom lash line, so that it's angle slightly upward toward the outer edge of your eyebrow. A sharper angle will create a sharper ""wing.""
Begin applying the eyeliner close to your top lash, starting near the inner corner of your eye. Apply it along your top lash line, then taper the eyeliner along the edge of the tape. Remove the tape when you're finished.
Repeat on the other side and clean up any mistakes.

, Break out of the mold of subtle neutrals and try a more exotic color palette. Experiment with turquoise, grass green, magenta and other bold eyeshadow colors to add an element of fun to your look.


For a truly exotic look, try a color fade. Use a light color in the inner corner of your lids, a darker color in the center, and the darkest color in the outer corners. Do a fade from yellow to green to blue, or from pink to purple to eggplant.
To give your look some extra flair, add a layer of glitter or some press-on rhinestones.

, Using eye shadow and mascara doesn't actually change the shape of your eyes, but does change the way they look. One of the most surefire ways to get your eyes looking exotic is to use smokey tones. Grays, silvers, blacks — you'll be constantly ready for a night on the town.



Doing smokey-eyed makeup is simple enough with just a few tones. Concentrate the darker tones on your crease, and highlight the inside of your eye with a bit of white. Add some bold eyeliner and mascara and you're ready to go.

, If you're not big on playing up your eyes, you can still change your look by accentuating the beauty of your cheekbones and lips. Learn how to apply contour makeup and your look will never be the same again.


High cheekbones can be emulated with the right shade of blush and bronzer contoured just above the apples of your cheeks.
As for a natural pout, use a neutral lipliner extended just below your actual lip and fill it in with a neutral lip color and gloss.

, Paint your nails an unusual color to add instant charm to your look. Golds, coppers, and other warm metallic tones will add an exotic splash of color. Corals will make your skin appear warmer-toned and bronzer, while dark silver or black will make your skin look creamy in contrast.

, Adjusting your wardrobe can have a dramatic effect on your appearance, as well as flattering your figure and changing your self-perception. Often, a wardrobe change is all that is needed to create an exotic look. Ditch the jeans and t-shirts and load your closet up with fun patterns, bright colors, and unique cuts.


Skirts and dresses provide a lot more options than pants and shirts do, in general. That being said, whatever isn't trending could do the trick. A vintage '30s flapper dress is exotic in one way, while a leather fighter pilot jacket is exotic in another. As long as it's unique, you've nailed it.

, Moving out of the norm in jewelry, hair accessories, and even your handbag can significantly change your look. Think big hoops, feathers, bangles, and anything else that is absolutely eye-catching. Just remember to keep it to a few accessories – you don't want to look like you're wearing your entire jewelry drawer.

, Sometimes all it takes to feel a little exotic is the courage to try someone no one else is trying. Choose one strikingly different piece and find a way to rock it. Be the person in your neighborhood who dares to have bold style.For example, get a fedora and pair it with a tight white t-shirt, suspenders and slim black pants. All those girly spring dresses your friends are wearing will suddenly seem a little boring in comparison.
Or go vintage clothes shopping and pick out a giant chunky necklace you can guarantee no one you know has, or a pair of bright red cowboy boots no one in your town would ever wear. Dare to be the exotic one.

, To have a slow, steady confidence and an alluring, mysterious demeanor, you can't be easily read. Keep your head up, shoulders back, and chest out to exude that natural sense of self. When it comes to being mysterious, don't give away exactly how you're feeling. That'd be too easy!


Keep the body language sexy, too. If you're a woman, use your hips. Cross your legs, keeping your calves slanted and next to each other when sitting. Move delicately but with purpose. If you're a man, keep a surveying look on your face when appropriate, and master the art of the coy grin.

, Don't give too much of yourself away too easily. Like in the previous step, a large part of being exotic is being alluring and new. When you're engaging, don't give away every detail of your life story. When you walk away from a conversation, let them have more questions than answers.


For example, imagine your definition of the most exotic woman. She's standing on a beach, gazing into the distance. Now imagine her on your couch, eating pork rinds and watching football. ...Not so exotic anymore, is she? A lot of being exotic has to do with circumstance and behavior, too. Master the look and the personality, and you'll be set.

And even though you may not have noticed much, your skin changes from 25 to 30, from 30 to 35, and 35 to 40. It’s high time to update your make-up – you want very thin coverage that makes you glow. It’s your natural beauty that’s ready to be center stage.


Stay away from liquid eyeliner which is cakey on less-than-firm skin. Stick to thicker pencils for that smokey on-the-town look at night. During the day, a bit of mascara and just a touch of eyeliner is more than enough.
Don’t wear too much makeup! There are very few occasions in your 20s when lots of makeup is appropriate, and there are even fewer in your 40s. Keep it simple. By now, your skin is beautiful. You don’t need it!;
, Adding low-lights around the edges of your chin and forehead add depth to your face, bringing out the light areas and your cheekbones. It’s no longer about hiding blemishes and looking awake – it’s about literally bringing out your best features.


Add a highlighter to the ""t-zone"" of your face – this includes the center of your forehead, nose, and chin. These places are all closest to the light source, so they should be the brightest. Use a makeup brush with a bit of cream concealer or pressed powder and blend the highlighter into these areas.

, One of the simplest things you can do for yourself is wash with an anti-aging cleanser every morning and night (or however often your skin allows). Make-up should not be left on your face and using an anti-aging cleanser can leave your skin feeling bare and able to breathe. It also gets into your pores, tightening everything up and making it glow.


Develop a beauty regimen that you can stick to and that you think works. It should include a cleanser, light makeup, and anti-aging creams and lotions. Experiment with a few products to find which ones work best for you.

, Take advantage of those 8 or so hours you have every night and put your skin to work – repairing itself, that is. Night creams sink into your pores acting as a collagen boost, slowing the progress of wrinkles and skin damage.


Feeling ambitious? You could use a day cream, too. Sure beats having to get botox regularly and it's much better for you in the long run.

, Hopefully water is a no-brainer – 8 glasses a day will keep your body hydrated, your skin glowing, and your hair and nails growing. But green tea (and plenty of it) and the occasional glass of red wine are great, too. They’re full of antioxidants that keep your insides churning at 100%.


Feel free to drink as much green tea as you like – if you don’t already, a glass in the morning is a good place to start. And when it comes to red wine, stick to 1 glass a day. Any more than that and the cholesterol-busting and antioxidant positive effects go by the wayside.

, This is good advice for everyone: when you feel good on the inside, you feel ‘’and look’’ good on the outside. Concentrate on eating plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats. Staying away from processed junk foods – anything that comes in a package, really – is best. Your body wants to eat fresh and natural and look fresh and natural!


If you struggle with your weight and have never found a diet that's worked, consider reading wikiHow's How to Choose a Diet that Suits You for an extensive look at two dozen of the most popular, current diets.
The older you get, the more your metabolism slows down and the more you have to watch what you eat. Nothing should be off-limits, but everything should be consumed in appropriate portions.

, Cardio is great for the mind and body, but even the skinniest of us need to keep firm. In the 40s, you want to target your arms, abs, and butt. That means pull ups, push ups, crunches, squats, and lunges. Sounds like bad news, but you can do all of those in your own home, a few minutes at a time or even while watching TV.


Aim for thirty minutes of exercise a day, with a combination of cardio and weight-training. Recent research has stated that a combination of both types of exercising is best for speeding up fat loss.As you age, your stratum corneum (a layer of your skin) gets thicker. This leads to wrinkles and cellulite, amongst other skin woes. However, it's coming to light that exercise prevents this from happening. In recent studies, those who are aging and who exercise have better skin than those who live mainly sedentary lifestyles., Often with age comes unwanted hair in the most of unwanted places. One day you’ll glance into the mirror at just the wrong angle and see a perpetrator that’s been growing for what has to have been months. To keep this from happening as much as possible, go in for regular waxes or consider LHE, Light & Heat Energy Technology that can laser the hair off. It’s getting cheaper and cheaper, especially for small areas like the chin and upper lip.


If you’ve got time and a few cups of sugar on hand, why not wax it off yourself? It’s cheap and takes only minutes. What’s more, a sugar wax can leave your skin feeling baby smooth.

, As we age, that sun exposure we just had to have as teens starts popping up in the form of dark spots, blotches, and sometimes even melanoma or cancer. Though you can’t change your less-than-wise teenage years, you can start staying out of the sun now. And good news: pale is in!


Apply an SPF 15 lotion regularly when going into the sun can’t be avoided. It will moisturize your skin too, keeping it hydrated and glowing.

, Just because you’re in your 40s does not mean you should be buttoning up and hiding your body. Though you should be adult and professional, you should also feel sexy, comfortable, and fashionable.


Take into account your body’s shape. What do you want to accentuate and what do you want hidden? Play up what you're proud of.
Stock your closet with classic pieces that you can rotate into dozens of different outfits. Have people saying, ""That is one distinguished 30-year-old right there, that is.""

, Grays are a dead giveaway to your age, even though they look good on a few people. If you’re not one of them, don't hesitate to cover them up. Choose a natural color that’s only a shade or two away from your own actual tresses.


If you're seriously graying, you may wish to color eyebrows, too – they may end up giving you away if they're also changing color.

, Just because you’re not chewing on your hair in algebra class anymore doesn’t mean you can’t have long hair. Sure, it’s a bit harder to fuss with, but your hair is beautiful! Keep it to layers and highlights and you can appear trendy and younger in one go.


That is, if you want long hair. You may decide that after years of dealing with it, it's just not worth it anymore. Though long hair can be an indicator of youth, as long as your hair is taken care of, you'll look good.

, With age comes experience...experiences of smoking, drinking coffee, and teeth turning yellow or gray. Take initiative and get them whitened, either with a kit or at the dentist’s office. They don’t need to be blindingly white, just the natural ivory shade of 10 years ago.


There are a number of kits out there you can do at home that range from a few days to a few weeks. Most involve somewhere around 30 minutes a day. And if that’s not enough, there are often whitening toothpastes you can combine with the kits, too.

, When our hormones change as they do with age, it’s natural for nails to get a bit brittle. Combat this by putting a strengthener on your nails, or using a strengthening colored nail polish. Keep them at a trim yet delicate length, too.


Go in for regular manicures and pedicures for an excuse to relax as well. Clear, French, and pastels and lighter, neutral-tinted tones are best. That goes for just about any age if you want to appear sophisticated and professional.

Have a beauty and fashion clean out.,
Buy quality underwear.,
Get decent ""basics"".,
Purchase the ""classics"".,
Reshape your wardrobe to evolve it into you.,
Kick in a good beauty regime.,
Use a stick foundation (in the correct colour for your skin tone) to even out skin, try SPF.,
Get a great hairstyle.,
Exercise weekly (at least).",How to Look Fabulous," Go through your wardrobe and bathroom cabinet. Keep only the things that fit, are not torn, stained or damaged in any way. For makeup, don't keep anything that is really old, unused or looks bad or cheap. For clothes don't keep anything that you don't like or haven't worn. Go through shoes, accessories, everything. Depending on your current level of fabulousness, this may or may not leave you with many clothes or much makeup.;
, And wear it! Discard the ratty faithfuls and buy some that maximize your assets and become the new, good quality faithfuls instead. It doesn't matter who doesn't see them; you know they're on and you'll feel better for it, as well as being shaped better.

, The definition can vary depending on your personal style, but generally this consists of tees, socks, gym wear, etc in neutral, muted colours. Go on a shopping trip to a reliable store. This should not be expensive. Get everything that you need.

, These are the time-tested essentials that you can't go wrong with (as opposed to faddy fashions). When shopping, think classy. Classics aren't impulse buys, make a list before you get out of the house. Google search ""Tim Gunn's 10 Essential Elements"" to get an example, though this may not be to everybody's taste. This section of your wardrobe should be of high quality, both the style and the piece should last season after season.

, Look through fashion magazines (or even just their websites) to see what the current trends are. Skinny jeans or flares? Hats or headbands? What appeals to you in the current trends? Only choose the ones that you like and that suit you. Don't go overboard on this one - this bit's for cheap, seasonal clothes. Get a few items every season.

, Make sure you have a daily cleanse-tone-moisturise facial care regime. In the summer months, put on a light sunscreen every day. Shower daily. Shave or wax regularly. Keep nails clean and tidy. Use odour-free deodorant. Pick a signature scent that you always wear, put it on right after you get out of the shower, it can smell funny on fabrics.

, Use mascara to play up eyes. To add colour, use blush for paler complexions and lipstick (in natural colour) for darker ones.

, Wash and condition hair five times a week. Blow-dry every time you wash, make sure you use some heat-protection product. Get your hair cut regularly to dispel split-ends.

, If you find exercise boring, do sports that are more enjoyable. If you're really into exercise, do an anaerobic-aerobic-yoga routine.

Fake a shower.,
Get dressed.,
Do your hair.,
Do one minute makeup.",How to Look Beautiful in 10 Minutes1," If you’ve only got ten minutes, you don’t have time to shower, but you do have time to fake it. Quickly wash your face, then wipe your body down with baby wipes to remove any odors. Cover your body with lotion to hide any smells and also to moisturize your skin.If you’re still concerned that you smell, spray a spritz of your favorite perfume into the air, then walk through the spray to allow the scent to settle on your skin.
If you see any makeup remaining on your face after your face wash, remove it with makeup remover.
Make sure to apply moisturizer to your face and hands as well as your body.
Don’t forget to apply deodorant!;
, Getting dressed in a rush doesn’t have to be a huge source of stress. Choose an outfit that is easy to throw on, while still being stylish and flattering. Wear an outfit that is all black for a fashionable look that you can put together in a hurry.If you’re not feeling black, throw on a dress. Dresses are only one piece, which means you don’t have to worry about matching tops and bottoms.
Add an accessory. Whether it’s a fun shoe or a statement necklace, add an old favorite to your outfit to make it pop. It will only take a second to put on, and adding some texture to your clothing will make it seem like you put some thought into your outfit.

, If you’re running late, chances are you don’t have time to wash, curl or straighten your hair. So unless you’ve got the best head of hair on Earth, you’ll probably want to put your hair up. Depending on your mood, either roll your hair into a sleek sock bun, or manipulate it into a messy top knot.For a sock bun, you’ll either need an actual cut up sock or a sock bun form. Put your hair into a high ponytail and slide the sock or bun form over the ends of your hair. Roll the sock down the length of your hair until all your hair is held in place. Use bobby-pins to pin the sock bun in place.
Spray your hair with a texturizing cream before putting your hair in a top knot. The cream will help create more volume and will make your messy top knot look effortlessly chic.
If doing your hair seems impossible when you’re running late, throw on a hat and forget about it., If you have an all-over color stick, run the stick along your eyelids, lips and cheekbones and blend. This will give you a fresh-faced rosy look that will take only one minute to apply.If you have pale eyelashes, skip the color stick and use the time to instead apply mascara.
If your eyebrows are your most powerful facial feature, spend your time brushing and filling them in. You don’t have to completely fill them in; instead, dot at sparse areas with an eyebrow pencil, then use a tinted brow gel to give them a gentle coating.

"
"
Moisturize your face.,
Apply liquid highlighter.,
Conceal all blemishes.,
Apply powder and blush.,
Add extras.",How to Look Beautiful in 10 Minutes2," Start with a clean and dry face. Quickly massage your face to reduce puffiness and clear away excess fluid. Apply your moisturizer of choice to your face and neck, making sure to apply the moisturizer to the center of your face and smooth outwards.If you’re feeling a little pale, use a tinted moisturizer to add a little color.
Apply the moisturizer either using a brush or your fingers. Using your hands will give you shearer coverage across your face.

, Liquid highlighter is used to give your face dimension and glow and can be applied very quickly. Draw stripes on your face under your eyes, chin, nose, forehead and in between the bottom of your nose and the top of your mouth.For your eyes, draw a series of diagonal stripes under your eyes and above your cheekbones.
For your nose, draw one single vertical stripe spanning the length of your nose.
For your Cupid’s Bow, draw a single vertical stripe centered directly under your nose.
For your chin, draw a single vertical stripe centered directly under your mouth.

, Use your preferred concealer and a concealer brush to blend the sides of your nose, under your eyes and any other areas of your face that are sporting redness or blemishes.If you’re especially tired or if your eyelids tend to skew red, rub an eyelid base across your lids to help you look more awake.
When blending your concealer, do not rub, but instead pat your skin gently.

, Brush a loose powder across your face to help set your makeup. Do not spread the powder across your face, but instead try to strategically brush it across the areas where you did not apply highlighter. When you’re finished applying powder, add your blush on top of that.Blush should be applied using a blush brush and should be applied to your cheekbones.
To isolate your cheekbones, try smiling. Then apply the blush to the apples of your cheeks by moving your brush in a c-shaped motion.
When you finish applying the blush, blend the makeup upwards using either your hands or a makeup sponge.

, If you still have time remaining, complete your normal makeup routine. Add mascara or lipstick. If you like using eyeliner, apply that now. Your skin should look dewy and luscious at this point, so try to keep the extra makeup to a minimum, so as not to disguise from your simple and clean beauty.


It’s better to make a statement on just one portion of your face. So if you’re adding mascara and eyeliner, steer clear of lipstick. If you’re adding a pop of color in your lips, leave your eyes naked.

"
"
Skip the makeup and apply bronzer instead.,
Line your lower eyelid with a nude pencil.,
Frontload your evening routine.",How to Look Beautiful in 10 Minutes3," Bronzer is a great way to look like you just came back from a tropical vacation and it’s very easy to apply quickly. Use a fan brush to apply bronzer to your cheekbones, hairline, side of your nose and the crease of your eyes.Do not go too heavy on the bronzer or you’ll look like you have a bad fake tan.
Buy your bronzer at a makeup store where an employee can help you pick out the correct color for your skin tone.

, If you need to look awake in a hurry, use a freshly sharpened nude pencil and run it along the inner rim of your eyelid. Keep your lines very thin by applying the smallest amount of pressure to the tip of your pencil.To make your eyes appear bigger and farther apart, only line the lower eyelid ¾ of the way.
Blend the eyeliner carefully, making sure to blend upward and side to side, but never down.

, If you know you’re the kind of person who tends to run short on time and motivation in the morning, beef up your nightly beauty regimen. Try sleeping with a moisturizing mask on so your skin looks fresh and dewy in the morning.Keep makeup remover on your bedside table so you have no excuse to go to bed with your makeup still on.
Wash and braid your hair at night, so in the morning, you have easy, loose waves.

Apply makeup sparingly.,
Get a nice eyeshadow color on.,
Wear sunscreen whenever you can.,
Avoid heat damage on your hair.,
Shorts are your friends.,
Tops.,
Dresses are totally in style, too.,
Keep jewelry to a minimum.,
Accessorize with shoes.,
Wear clothes you feel good in.",How to Look Cute in the Summer," The idea is to make you look sun-kissed and natural, letting your makeup accentuate your natural beauty instead of draw attention away from it.


Start with a tinted moisturizer or some loose bronze mineral powder. Apply as necessary.
Sweep your favorite blush over the apples of your cheeks up to your temples, remembering to blend.;
,


Sweep a tiny bit of sheer bronze or gold eyeshadow across your eyelids, up to your eyebrows. Use less product the higher up you get.
Hydrate and protect your lips with a tinted balm, brush on a fresh coat of waterproof mascara and you're good to go!

, Lobster-skin is neither flattering nor healthy. Avoid tanning beds, too, as they can cause cancer. Soaking up the sun is good for you, but remember to wear sunscreen with an SPF of 15-30. (If you burn easily, up the SPF.) You'll still get that sun-kissed glow, but you'll also stave off skin cancer and any irritating redness.

, Skip the flat iron and the curlers for a natural look that's sure to impress. Contrary to what you might think, your natural hair texture can always be stylish. Embrace your natural assets instead of working to change them.


For the ever-popular beach waves, fill a spray bottle with water and a tablespoon of salt. Wet your hair, either in the shower or manually, but do not brush it. When your hair is nearly dry, spritz it with your salt solution and tousle it with your fingers. This works best if you flip your hair is upside down. Let it dry naturally.
Other great styles include the super-high ballerina bun, the messy pony, loose braids, or hair with twists at the sides. The look you're going for is effortlessly beautiful.

, Wear them often; your legs will thank you for it. Steer clear of booty shorts, as they might give the impression you're trying too hard. Don't be afraid to go for some sweet skirts, too. While denim skirts are a little 1990s, cotton skirts with body and maxi skirts in a fun print are both comfortable and fashionable.


Khaki, navy blue or army green are classic colors for shorts.
If you want to shoot for trendy, try neon colors (really stylish this summer) or bright corals.
If you feel uncomfortable in shorts, try bermudas or petal pushers. Only wear what you feel comfortable in.

, Anything goes, as long as it's tasteful. Some fashionable top styles this summer are loose racer-back tanks, burnt-out shirts, crop tops, lacy/frilly camis and tees. Empire waist shirts are especially flattering, but opt for cuts that you feel comfortable in above all else. Again, try bright colors and prints. Floral and tribal prints are in style right now.

, Dresses range from the little white dress to the printed maxi-dress; the possibilities here are quite literally endless.


Because it's summer, look for light fabrics in bright colors and patterns.
Add extra splash and detail with ruffles, embroidery or even metal studs.
Make sure your decolletage and derriere aren't hanging out, unless you plan on courting some unwanted attention from guys.

, Gold is a great summer color because it catches and deflects sunlight, but use it sparingly. (A little goes a long way.) Natural textures such as wood, hemp, pleather and suede are all great choices.

, The possibilities are practically endless. Try out simple tennis shoes or tie-up sandals. And don't forget about the quintessential flip-flop.


Some shoe-ins this summer are espadrilles (flat or heeled), Keds-type sneakers, gladiators, and Birkenstocks. Make sure you can walk around in your shoes of choice—you'll be wearing them all summer!

, Summer is all about letting loose and enjoying yourself. Let your clothing reflect that.

First, take a shower.,
Once you get out, check to see if your eyebrows need any plucking.,
Don't forget to rub in a good lotion or cream on your neck, shoulders, and arms.,
Of course, brush your teeth, floss and use mouthwash.

,
If you straighten or do anything else to your hair, do so.,
Wearing too much foundation doesn't look natural.,
Although natural beauty is the best kind, if you're going to use makeup don't use too much.,
Make sure your nails are clean.,
Get dressed, and before you go shopping know what looks best on you.",How to Look and Feel Your Best Every Day," You sweat while you sleep and that makes you stink. Use a good smelling soap and be sure to shave your underarms and legs if it's necessary. Use shampoo and conditioner, but not too much conditioner.;
, It's less painful to pluck after a nice hot shower. Next, dry your hair to about 95% dry so it doesn't completely dry out. Then, wash your face if you didn't in the shower.

, Make yourself smell good, but remember not to overdo it or mix scents.

,, (Tip: never straighten your hair if it's wet. Sure, it saves time, but it makes your hair dry, which damages your hair, and gives it a straw-like appearance)

, If you have serious acne, go to the dermatologist or use an acne solution. It'll be the best thing you ever do for yourself. In the mean time, pat on some concealer with a light powder and go easy with the foundation.

, Choose to play up the lips or the eyes, never both. If you want to do your eyes, use an eyeshadow, and maybe some mascara or eyeliner and a natural color lip with a little clear gloss. If you want to go for the lips, use your favorite lipstick and only use a little mascara on your eyes. (No tarantula legs.)

, Keep them short, and use a moisturizing lotion of your hands. People often judge you on the way your hands and nails are kept. Don't wear polish until it chips away, and don't over grow your nails. If you're going for fakes, go for the classic short French manicure look. Bold fake nails are outdated. Avoid buying the plastic kind and doing them yourself. Go to a salon. If you can't afford that, just keep your nails short and clean.

, Consider the color of your eyes, your skin tone, your body shape and your personal style when shopping.

Don't over-do the make up.,
Get a good hygiene.,
Drink water.,
Sleep well.,
S-M-I-L-E!,
Be yourself.,
Get good clothes.,
Add accessories.,
Keep your body fit.,
Keep your hair in check.",How to Look Better Than You Already Are," Using make all the time isn't good for you skin. Use a little mascara on the upper lashes and a clear or pink lip gloss and maybe a little blush to highlight you face or liquid liner starting from the middle of your upper lash line and outwards. This defines your eyes and gives you the 'cat eyes' look. If you don't feel like wearing any at all,I suggest putting on lip balm. It helps protect your lips from drying out and gets you closer to achieving those soft,pink lips.;
, Get rid of spots,acne,zits,and pimples for clean,pure skin. If you can't, then get concealer, foundation, or put on natural looking make up. Be sure that the concealer or foundation is the same color as your natural skin tone.Remember to use the make up remover to get off all that make up muck. Take a shower or bath every day,but don't get you hair wet unless you're going to properly shampoo and condition it. Always condition your hair after you shampoo so you can get the silky, glossy and good smelling hair you wanted. Use lotion if you have dry skin, and use sun screen if you want creamy white skin.Brush your teeth. If you have problems having a good smelling breath,mouth wash and a good smelling toothpaste will do the trick. If pearly whites is the problem,use a good whitening toothpaste and good toothbrush.Brush about 1-3 minutes every time.If you want to smell good, then try to layer fragrances. Start with a scented shower gel or bath oil. Move on to body lotion and finish with a light splash of perfume or body spray.

, It will leave your skin glowing and your hair shining. It is also good for your body because, as you know, 80% of your body is made of liquid.

, Not only will you feel great, but it give your body a chance to freshens itself and you will look better than the day before.Sweet treats, heavy meals, and sugary drinks before bed will keep you awake,so avoid this.If your tummy's rumbling,then have a cup of warm chamomile tea to help you relax.Try to relax before bed by listening to some gentle music.Make sure you have done your homework earlier,doing right before bed will keep you awake.Put a glass of water next to your bed just in case you wake up thirsty. Pull on some comfy pajamas, wash your face, brush your teeth, and hop on to bed. Read for a while until you are nice and sleepy,then turn out the lights.

, Even ugly people look better when they smile nicely.

, Now, just because you're trying to look better doesn't mean you going to go all phony. Be yourself, because the beauty inside is more important than the outside.

, For some occasions, such as when you go to church, wear dressy stuff, like a dress with dressy but comfortable shoes, like wedges or ballet flats.For everyday wear, go for skinny (but not so skinny that you can't breathe) blue jeans and a cute t-shirt and cool and comfortable shoes,and every now and then, wear a skirt.

, Necklaces, bracelets, rings, earrings, hair clips, the choice is endless! Maybe a necklace and earrings are fine for everyday wear. Oh, a hair clip or headband is fine, too. Remember to make the accessories match the second main color of your clothes. For an example, If you are wearing matching purple skirt and shirt with orange lining and details,then use orange accessories that are a little brighter than the clothes.Remember to keep it to a minimum, though, too much is more than enough!

, That doesn't mean you should be the slenderest girl on the block. Just eat well and exercise. If you're not very happy about working out, exercise does not mean work out. Do something. Dance, swim, run, or just simply play!

, Regularly shampoo and condition your hair for silky, shiny, luscious locks, but remember to rinse it thoroughly, or it will leave your hair dull and drab, and sometimes, left over shampoo or conditioner will cause an itch to your scalp! Also,different hairstyles will show off what beautiful hair you have. Wearing your hair in a ponytail is one of the prettiest (and simplest) hairstyle you can make. Other essentials are braids, pigtails, buns, side ponytails, and simply let your hair down.

Have a healthy weight.,
Exercise.",How to Look Breathtaking2," Remember, the right weight for you depends on your body (bones, height, etc), not on what you want. Look at a weight index; this will have the healthy weight range for your height. Decide if you should be on the low, middle or high end depending on your bone size. This might take a lot of time, but it is worth it. Find a healthy way to do this. You may want to try the following steps, or even better, follow a healthy diet.

, Set goals. Walk at least 2,000 steps or go biking. Even after you've reached your desired weight, keep up the good work to maintain a healthy weight.

Eat healthy snacks throughout the day.,
Eat six small meals a day.,
Eat a small healthy meal in the middle of the day.,
Eat a nutritious dinner.",How to Look Breathtaking3," Any fruit will do, like apple, peach, mango, or banana. A bowl of high fiber cereal, a whole grain muffin, bagel, or English muffin, scrambled eggs, yogurt, granola, and cottage cheese are also good choices. If you drink milk, have low fat, fat free, skim or soy milk.

, Refrain from eating foods high in calories and fat. 100-calorie packs are OK, but it's better to eat fruits, carrot or celery sticks. Little healthy snacks during the day gives you needed energy and prevent you from binging. Some good snack ideas are:


roasted almonds
skim mozzarella cheese
a fresh-fruit smoothie






butter free popcorn






low-fat frozen yogurt
any fresh fruit or vegetable
a small salad

a whole wheat pita
low-sodium pretzels
baked chips
A bowl of high fiber cereal

light yogurt
whole wheat crackers
black bean tortilla chips and salsa

dark chocolate (not too much!)
low fat cottage cheese

, Most nutritionists agree six smaller meals per day are better than three meals a day. A good way to get six small meals is to take your three meals and cut them in half.

, This meal can consist of a meat or tofu and several healthy snacks.

, For dinner, you need to have a protein, like meat, fish, or tofu, and two healthy sides like beans, vegetables, or potatoes.

Accentuate your skin.",How to Look Breathtaking6,"


It's best for darker-skinned girls to flaunt flashy colors. As for blonds, they should use pastel colors, whereas brunettes should use ""earth colors"". Also, browns and gold are best for blue eyes, purples and violets for green eyes, and blues for brown eyes.

Smokey eyes look perfect on everybody! However, pay attention to the colors you choose.
Use concealer to cover up spots such as bags or acne. Don't overdo it, though!
Use mascara. Make sure your mascara doesn't clump, because clumping looks too unnatural.
Use rouge. Bronze your cheeks and nose in the summer. Ask an assistant in the store to help you with this. Gloss your lips to make them look juicy and full.
Use foundation if your skin is bad. Ask for help in the make-up store for the color that suits you.

, Try on the different colors on your wrist to find which one accentuates your looks best while looking most natural. Pick a livelier color for your most prominent and beautiful facial feature.

Clothes.,
Shoes!,
Always carry a matching bag with you.",How to Look Breathtaking7,"


Have a LBD (little black dress), a white t-shirt and a good pair of jeans. Those are your basics. They go with anything. For example, the LBD can be paired with red pumps and a wide red belt to make a super-cute IN outfit!
Look in fashion magazines and find outfits you love and look around in inexpensive stores for look-a-like items.
Buy more accessories than clothes because accessories are the personal touch you give to things, and that is more important than fashion itself.
If you wear skirts or dresses and don't have the nicest legs, use leg make-up, nylons, or avoid shorter skirts/dresses.
See what looks good on you rather than blindly following what you see in the latest fashion magazine. Skinny jeans may be in but if you don't have the shape to carry them off, you will end up being a fashion victim.

, Shoes can make or break the outfit, so pick wisely.


Have your shoes match a small accent in your outfit, like if you have a red belt, wear red shoes. It you have a wide visible green hem, wear green shoes.
Wear high heels. It gives you a sexy feeling, it makes your butt, and legs look better. If you can't walk in them, ask someone who can to teach you before you ever wear them out in public and start with shorter heels.
Have some sneakers or flats for the days you have to run, or the days when you simply aren't in the mood for sore feet.







, You should carry these things in your handbag:



Water. Drinking water will make your skin radiant and healthy.
A small mirror (to check your makeup and hair)

Wear dark colors.,
Wear formal attire.,
Wear clothing that fits well.,
Groom yourself very well.",How to Look Confident1," Dark colors make people seem more confident and authoritative, so when you need to look confident wear black, charcoal, navy, or other dark colors. Avoid pastels and other lighter tones when you want to appear confident.;
, Whether you are a student or a professional, wearing clothing that is more formal and professional than what other people wear will make you seem more confident. People will perceive you as more confident if you wear slightly dressier clothing than you need to wear.For example, instead of wearing a collared shirt to school, wear a freshly pressed button down shirt. Or if you are giving a presentation and you would normally wear a casual outfit, wear something dressier like a suit.

, If your clothing is ill fitting, you will likely be fiddling with it all day. Constantly readjusting your clothes will make you seem like you lack confidence and it may actually make you feel less confident. Instead, choose clothing that fits very well so that you won’t have to constantly readjust your outfit as you go through your day., Maintaining sleek hair, a fresh face, and manicured nails will also contribute to your appearance of self-confidence. If you look well kept, then you will seem more confident to others."

Practice power posing.,
Take up space.,
Stand up straight.,
Aim your torso and toes at the person you are talking to.,
Be still.",How to Look Confident2," Standing tall with your arms and legs spread out wide will help you to feel more confident. This type of dominant pose also reduces cortisol and increases testosterone, which will add to your confidence. Take a moment to duck into bathroom stall or empty room and power pose for a minute before you need to walk confidently., Occupying more space will make you seem larger and more confident to others. Use your arms and legs to claim more of the territory around you.When you are standing, place your hands on your hips and stand with your legs about shoulder width apart.
When you are sitting, lean back and stretch your legs out in front of you and rest one or both arms on the backs of the seats next to you. If there is a table or desk in front of you, you can place your arms on the table and spread them out and away from your body., A hunched appearance projects a lack of confidence. Instead, walk straight and tall to seem confident. As you walk, keep your shoulders back and lift up your chin slightly.


Test your posture by holding a pencil in each hand and making a fist. Let your arms fall loosely at your sides. If the pencils face inward (towards you), then you are hunching your shoulders. Shift your shoulders back until the pencils face forward to see how your ideal posture should be while you walk.

, Directing your body towards the person you are talking to demonstrates your respect for them as well as interest in what they have to say, but it also contributes to an appearance of confidence. People who lack confidence may find it harder to face other people directly during a conversation., Fidgeting makes you look nervous and uncomfortable, which makes you seem like you lack confidence. Train yourself to keep still when you are standing or sitting.If you are standing, place your hands on your hips or hold something in one or both of your hands. You can hold a mug, clipboard or notepad, a pen, or something else that is appropriate for your situation. Just make sure that you don’t fidget with the object.
If you are seated, firmly plant your hands on the arms of a chair or on top of a table. Just remind yourself not to tap your fingers on the table."

Make eye contact.,
Stare until the other person looks away.,
Smile at people.",How to Look Confident3," Making and holding eye contact with someone when you are talking to them shows that you are confident. People who lack confidence are more likely to shy away from making eye contact. Shy people might even look down or let their eyes wander around the room.


While it is good to look away now and then once you have established good eye contact, make sure that you look at something that is eye level.Looking away now and then will also help you avoid seeming creepy, which can be a side effect of eye contact that is too intense., One way that you can establish an appearance of confidence is to look into someone’s eyes until he or she breaks the gaze and looks away. This technique will not only make you seem more confident to the other person, it will also help you to see that the other person is just as nervous as you are.


Just remember that you do not need to do this more than one time. If you do it through your whole conversation, you risk seeming a bit creepy or even aggressive., People are attracted to smiling faces because people who smile seem more confident and approachable. Make sure to smile when you enter a room, when you meet new people, and as you talk to people. Just don’t smile in a way that seems forced or unnatural. Smile the way that you normally do."

Don't just look part, be the part.,
From now on, when you go shopping for clothes, choose your garments carefully, so you'll have a wardrobe of items that will work together.,
Spend a minimal amount of time on your hair, if you try too hard, it shows.,
Accessorize with bracelets.,
Get a hobby which gets you outside.,
Denim Shorts: denim shorts are one of the hottest summer trends every year.,
Maxi dresses: They are a massive trend this year, and you can see why.,
Denim Jackets: It's too hot for a coat, but a little too cool to go without?,
Floral prints: They're girly, summery, feminine and trendy, so what's not to love?!,
Introducing the ""LWD"" For parties, ditch the little black dress, and bring in the little white dress instead.,
Short tops: Whether it's checkered shirts tied up, baggy short tops, off the shoulder with a slogan or a tight belly-top, there are loads of different types of short tops to wear this summer.,
Playsuits: They're different from what people normally wear, and most wimp out of trying them.,
Mini bags: They don't get in the way but you can fit your money, phone and eyeliner in there so they are perfect for summer.,
Baggy tops: They look casual but flattering.,
Make-up: Go for the natural look when it comes to make up.",How to Look Carefree for Summer," Be more laid back and carefree, deal with anything that's stressing you out at the moment so that won't bother you any more. Just focus on enjoying your summer! Then work the look around how you're feeling and it'll come more naturally.

, Always make sure you have the basics (such as jeans and T-shirts), but keep it causal. Items like flowing tank tops, boho dresses (especially maxi), flowing skirts, lightweight sweaters can spice up your carefree style and add some diversity.

, Girls:Go for natural looking beach waves, messy buns or tousled plaits/braids. To make a hairstyle look prettier while still remaining effortless, add a hair accessory, invest in some flowers, hippie-style hairbands, or jeweled headbands. Boys: The ""just out of bed"" look has always been hot, so invest in some wax and ruffle your hair up a bit. In the summer, it's better to have your hair a little longer than you'd normally have it.

, A popular trend with both girls and fellas in the summer is braided bracelets which are never taken off. Don't worry about them getting tatty, they still look good that way. Guys should go for neutral colours like brown, beige, black and grey, whereas girls can be more creative and get colorful ones, with things such as beads on them. Permanent shell necklaces can also add carefree flair.

, The more time you spend outside doing things, the more energetic you'll be, the more you'll enjoy your summer, and the better your tan will be. Try skateboarding, rollerblading, tennis, swimming... your options are endless. Make sure that you try a few things out, and go with what you enjoy, not what other people do. Others will like you more if you show independence rather than copying what other people do.

, To make them a bit cooler, go for cut off styles. These are really easy to make yourself from a pair of old jeans if you cut the legs off and pull on the threads to create a raw edge. If you have short but slim legs then go for tight fitting ones which follow the curve of your leg, if your legs are a bit wider then choose looser fitting shorts which open up slightly at the thigh. Tall, slim girls can look good in most styles of shorts. A particularly popular trend with shorts this year is the high-waisted type, and these often go well with a mid-rift length top. Denim skirts are also an option.;
, They mix together summery hippy styles with beautiful femininity, but all with minimum effort. If you have a large frame then choose one that pinches in at the waist, or one that could be pinched in with a belt to avoid looking like a tent. Wearing a V neckline will make someone look slimmer, a round neckline will hold bigger breasts more easily. Experiment with different prints, and find something that looks gorgeous on you.

, Reach for a denim jacket. Fairly affordable, timeless and go with any outfit. Denim in general makes an outfit look relaxed and casual, so why only wear it on jeans? Wearing it as a jacket makes it a bit more interesting. A light shade of denim is more suited for summer. Try wearing one over a maxi dress or a floral top. As a lighter alternative to a denim jacket, look for a denim-style shirt and try wearing that, unbuttoned, over an outfit. Denim shirts look best a size too big. It's usually best to only wear one item of denim clothing at a time, so don't wear a denim top and jeans at the same time.

, Floral prints are everywhere in summer, on shorts, skirts, dresses, shoes, baggy tops and bags. If you're not a very girly girl then go for floral accessories such as earrings, bags and shoes rather than a floral clothing to keep it minimal. Try not to wear too many flower prints at one time, otherwise you'll look like an accident in a florist. This fits in with the previous trends mentioned, try a floral print maxi dress, or a short tie up flowery top and denim shorts.

, Less sultry, but more feminine, girly, relaxed and summery. It can be glammed up with metallics and a pair of heels for a party or night out, or dressed down a bit with a jacket and some flat pumps or little boots to make you look effortlessly gorgeous for a date. While white can leave you looking washed out in the winter months, in the summer it will sit nicely against your tan making you look more golden.

, They go well with either shorts or jeans. They are good for people who have a good figure that they want to flaunt without looking too trashy. However be warned that tops that show too much tummy can look a bit tacky, so choose ones that only show a couple of inches, or only one side, or wear with high-waisted shorts or trousers. If you have a top that you like the pattern of, but not the shape, there are lots of ways you can alter it to your liking if you have a pair of scissors, just search for it on the internet to find out how to do it and get all those old t-shirts up to date with the trends.

, However this is what makes them interesting. They can look casual and carefree, but in-fashion at the same time, just shop around for the right type to suit you. If you find a style which flatters your shape then it's another great opportunity to show off the good bits of your figure without looking like you've tried too hard. Many floral ones are in the shops so you'll be hitting two trends with one stone. If you're not sure what you're going to be doing one day, stick on an outfit that you wouldn't mind getting dirty, and you can easily take it from casual to formal by sticking on a pair of heels and a nice bag.

, Look for slouchy, leather styles for really casual days. On days when you want to make more effort go for a more structured, colored bag. Have ones with long straps that you can just sling over your shoulder.

, Try wearing a big t-shirt over a pretty bikini with denim shorts. Or, you could wear a baggy vest top over a tight vest top. The clothes are unlikely to be sold as baggy clothes, just go and buy them a few sizes larger than you actually are. They'll be much more comfortable in the heat than a tight top, and you'll look gorgeous, but as if you didn't even try,


The above are just a few ideas for outfits, but there are many other things that you can wear in summer to make yourself look like a carefree girl. Just go for a look around the shops, and try to make sure that the things you end up with in your wardrobe are going to go well together so that you can mix and match things. Don't forget to make the most of your old, forgotten clothes. You could either re-shape them or belt them or something.

, Choose tinted moisturizer rather than foundation. It won't melt and run down your face when it's hot, and will let your natural prettiness shine through while still evening out your skin tone. A bit of lengthening mascara will help to widen your eyes while a line of eyeliner on your upper lid only will add a bit of drama without looking like you're wearing lots of make up. Keep your lips natural with a slick of lip balm and perhaps a neutral lip stain.

Wear showy hair.,
Wear noticeable makeup (though you should also learn to like the way you look without it), but use a bit of moderation.,
Practice good skin care habits, and also have reasonably good teeth.,
Wear your nails somewhat long (a bit beyond the fingertips), in any shape but pointy.,
Have fun with jewelry, but again, use self-control!,
Try body jewelry (e.g.,
Wear flashy, sexy clothes, but remember the concept of balance.,
Wear good bras, but avoid push-up ones unless you have a very small bust.",How to Look Flashy and Sexy Without Looking (Too) Tarty," However, don't wear platinum or very light blonde hair below shoulder length (unless it's straight or worn in, say , a bun). See Tip # 3 for guidelines concerning very pale blonde hair. Otherwise, wear long hair, curly, straight, crimped, etc. Wear your natural color (but cover up any gray hair!), or dye it a shade of medium blonde, dark blonde, red, brown or even black (if you can carry very dark hair well). Also, have fun with different hairdos and hair accessories, but only wear one hair accessory at a time!:-) Try a bouncy ponytail (or a half-ponytail), headbands or barrettes.;
, Use black or dark eyeliner in rather thin lines, and use pencil liner, not liquid. Wear bright, dark or shiny lipsticks, too. However, if you wear more eye makeup (e.g. a dark gray eye-shadow), only apply shadow to lids, and wear a more natural-looking, quiet lipstick (or a clear gloss). If you wear a bright eye shadow (like blue), only wear a bit, and wear a natural lipstick. Darker skinned women can carry off a bit more bright shadow. Use mascara, but not so much that it clumps. Avoid obvious blusher on cheeks.

, Brush your teeth twice a day, and visit your dentist at least once a year. Get teeth straightened if they're too crooked (a bit crooked can be interesting!).

, Always wear nail polish, and have fun with all sorts of colors, glitter, French manicures, etc.. If you have to wear your nails shorter for your job, then, short nails are also attractive.

,:-) Wear all sorts of earrings, including those new large, chunky plastic kinds. Also, try other kinds of jewelry. Wear rings (no more than two per hand), but avoid those with big stones. They're nice, but they're for older women. Sometimes, wear bracelets (all sorts), a necklace, an ankle chain or a brooch on a blouse. However, avoid wearing all of these jewels at once or else you'll look like a X-Mas tree!:-)

, belly button jewels, nose and eyebrow jewels, etc.), if you find it interesting. If you don't want to get a body piercing, you can make fake body jewelry. Again, don't overdo! Don't wear all the types of body jewelry; only wear one or two types (e.g. nose and/or belly button). If you wear body jewelry, avoid huge earrings. If jewel is on your face, wear a more subtle lipstick (or a very thin layer of a bright lipstick; this can be very attractive).

, If you wear a short top (or arrange your shirt to show your belly button), then, wear pants, but not little short shorts (unless you live in a tropical climate) or a mini skirt. And show little or no cleavage. Avoid showing you navel if you're wearing certain prints or fabrics: animal prints, metallics, leathers, patent leathers.

, Wear pretty panties, but they don't necessarily have to be thongs. Avoid letting underwear show under clothes, except for ,maybe , bra straps. Don't wear skirts that are so tight that your butt sticks out.

Be confident.",How to Have a Great Sense of Style," You don't need to flip through fashion magazines to become inspired. You can find styles everywhere you look. Re-watch your favorite movie and notice what types of clothes they're wearing. There must be someone in your life whose style inspires you. Reach out to that person for advice.


Set some parameters to help guide your style. Don't be afraid to aim for a blend a few styles, for example punk and valley girl.;
, After setting some guidelines for yourself, think of some clothes you could use to help this idea. Start small and consider easy items to find like a jean jacket or a pair of Uggs.


Go window shopping. This will give you an idea of what's in style right now, and will give you a chance to see what items you like and dislike.

, Style doesn't have a rule book. You know yourself and your body. Style comes from within; it comes from your personality and aspirations. It's okay to like a clothing trend, just be sure to think twice before you hop on. Take aspects from trends, but ultimately hold your own personality., In a plain notebook, paste pictures of styles that you like and jot down notes about outfits you see. When you have a fashion dilemma or need to go shopping, flip through the book and find the outfits you like.

, Go through your clothes and make three different piles: keep, maybe, and give-away. Have a creative eye and think how you could adapt your current clothes into the style you're imagining. Offer your old clothes to friends, or try to sell them at a secondhand clothing store.

, You don't need to exclusively shop by brand. The most important rule of having style is to not be defined by labels. You don't need to wear Gucci or American Eagle to be a stylish person. It's not what you wear, but how you wear it.

, Use the current trends to guide your fashion not dictate it. Wear what you want. Think about what it is you want people to gain from your style. What does your outfit say to a stranger on the corner? Keep these in mind as you map out some ideas about your style., Don't go out and buy a tank top for the next heatwave if it's November in Chicago. Sometimes buying out of season is smart if the clearance for that item is low enough. For a general rule, buy pragmatically and buy clothes that you could wear tomorrow.


Since you're improving your style, you'll feel better buying clothes you can easily show off.

, Upgrading your wardrobe can be an expensive endeavor. If you have a smaller budget, consider buying in small increments and don't feel obliged to update everything you own. Create a budget of how much you'll allow yourself to spend before going shopping.


Create a list of the essentials you need before shopping.
Don't get stuck shopping to feel good if you can't afford it.

, Pick someone to come along with you who either dresses well or plays devil's advocate to your style. Having a pal around can help you sift through clothes faster and more efficiently. It helps to have someone whose opinion you trust about certain clothes you aren't sure about., Everyone has their colors that they feel comfortable in. If you find something that falls outside of your color palette, think hard about it. Especially try on the clothes that fit outside your color comfort. There's no reason not to buy something if it looks good, or fits into the style you're going for. Just think about it and save the receipt.

, A large part of pulling off an outfit is having the proper fit. Finding clothes that do fit you can sometimes be difficult. For tops check the shoulder and chest dimensions. The shoulder's seam should reach the edge of your shoulder and the chest shouldn't be too tight. Pants should fit comfortably around your waist and not sag.


Use changing rooms to evaluate the fit.If the buttons are gaping, you'll probably need one size larger.
Don't feel ashamed to get a larger size. Buying too small can be uncomfortable and unflattering.

, Don't succumb to uncomfortable clothes for fashion. Feel the material at the store and ask yourself, ""would I enjoy being wrapped in this?"" You can also pay attention to the fabrics and percentages used on the tags. Limit the amount of these fabrics in your clothes:


Polyester
Acrylic
Rayon
Acetate/Triacetate
Nylon, Take the clothes that you're imagining in an outfit and bring them to the dressing room. You don't even have to purchase all the items. This will lower the risks of buying something you're hesitant about.

, You can have a lot of nice single pieces of clothing, but it's not going to dazzle anyone unless you know how to put them together. Learn what colors work well together. Take a look at a color wheel and study what colors complement each other. Know when to rock heels and when to go for sneakers.


Try a monochromatic look, which means all your clothes are the same color. It's a basic technique, but can look modern and chic., Need a new skirt? Don't go and buy one; make one! Rip the sleeves of a long sleeved top or cut some shorts to make them into a skirt. You can create a lot of clothes, from thrift stores, that fit your style by modifying them at home.


Personalize your clothes. Make your own bag. It would be best to use a sewing machine to make the stitches are neat.
Customize your stale jeans. You can splatter paint on them or wash them with bleach.

, Jewels and other accessories can change an outfit from being okay to being in style. Know how much jewelry is too much. Take everything in moderation when first trying out new techniques for your outfit. Consider wearing a hat and figure what type of hat best suits your outfit. Baseball caps or a beanie can go a long way.

, Never settle on a style if you want more out of your appearance. Try wearing the wrong shoes with an outfit. Try for example, Doc Martins with a tennis outfit or a shorter skirt. The juxtaposition will create a fashionable look. Wear something big with something small. Try wearing a small crock top with an oversize coat.Wear a t-shirt that's clearly too big for you with tight pants or cut-off shorts. Tall t-shirts are becoming quite a trend.

, Wear your clothes; don't let your clothes wear you! Style is meant to empower you. It's not suppose to make you self-conscious. Don't feel obligated to stay in your comfort-zone. Also know that one bad day of fashion won't taint you for life.

Jewelry.",How to Have the Perfect New York Look," Let's start at the top. Of your head, that is. Hair can make or break the perfect 'New York' look, and it all starts with the cut. You'll need to get a trim every six weeks to keep it looking neat.;
, While you don't need any particular hair color to work the perfect 'New York' look, whatever color you do have needs to be definitive, whether it's blonde, brunette, red or black . If it's a drab in-between shade, get to a good colorist who can make it look more vibrant, but still believable and natural. You'll need touch-ups on your color every six weeks.

, While loose waves look lovely in a tropical island setting, the style you need for the perfect 'New York' look is sleek and straight. Curls and waves can be pretty, but it's very hard to make them look polished enough for the 'New York' look. If your hair isn't naturally straight and you're not willing to become a master of at-home blowouts, either get your hair blown out at a salon a couple times a week, or consider thermal reconditioning. Wear your hair down, and don't tuck it behind your ears. If you must get it off your face, pull it back into a sleek low ponytail, not a high bouncy cheerleader one, and use a plain elastic that blends well with your hair. And don't put it up; Twists and ballerina buns have their place in the world, but they just don't fit that relaxed cosmopolitan look.

, You'll need perfect skin, or at least, really good skin that you can make look perfect with makeup. Schedule monthly facials, and make friends with a dermatologist if you have problem skin. A good skincare routine is key as well. You should invest in high-quality products. Every morning and night, you should cleanse, tone, & moisturize - and don't forget the sunscreen.

, Have your brows professionally shaped on a regular basis, whether by waxing or threading. If your teeth aren't white, have them bleached. A dentist can make a dramatic and lasting difference to your teeth in just an hour or so.

, Perfect your skin with foundation, concealer, and loose powder, and wear a hint of pink or peach blush. Then add neutral eye shadow and eye liner to the eyes. Gold, bronze, or slightly shimmery brown shadow looks good, with dark brown or black liner. Top this off with curled lashes and black mascara. Lips should be glossed in a sheer shade of nude, peach, or neutral pink. Lip liner is optional, but if you do use it, fill in the entire lip and then top it with gloss. No mismatched liner allowed.

, The 'New York' look requires being fit and toned. You shouldn't look like a skeleton, but you should be relatively slender for your height and have nice taut muscles. New Yorkers walk a lot, and eat a lot of salads for lunch. Join in and soon you'll be the perfect shape for all those fancy clothes you'll fit in later.

, Take care of the skin on your body as meticulously as you care for the skin on your face. It should be soft and smooth. Shower with a moisturizing soap, apply body lotion, and shave, wax, trim and/or pluck any hairs that aren't on your head. Use a little perfume, but not too much, and make sure it's something sophisticated (the Bath and Body Works days are over -- think Robert Piguet, Bond No. 9, or Chanel.) No one who isn't hugging you should be able to smell your perfume.

, The 'New York' look absolutely requires manicured nails and pedicured toes. Get your nails done in a sheer neutral pink, like Essie's Ballet Slippers or Mademoiselle, and keep them short. Toenail colors should be seasonally appropriate; hot pink and coral look nice in the summer, while a classic cream red is always a good idea. You'll need manicures weekly and pedicures every 2-3 weeks.

, Contrary to popular belief, designer apparel is not necessary for the 'New York' look. What is necessary: sharp sleek lines, classic shapes, neutral colors (especially black), and a perfect fit in everything you wear. You should look smart and polished, and for the most part, timeless (but always throw in a nod or two to the seasonal trends to show you are fashion aware). Wear pointy-toed heels for work and other dressy occasions, and make sure your shoes are very high quality and in good condition. The same goes for your bag. The bag is one place where spending a lot will get you bonus points, if you can afford it. A designer bag gives you a certain cachet, which is helpful in order to really work the 'New York' look.

, You'll need to wear jewelry, but carefully. 'New York' look women wear diamond studs, and you'll want the best you can get -- don't even bother unless they're 1.5-2 carats total weight. If you can't afford real ones that big, get good-quality fakes. You'll also need a good watch, the best you can afford -- Tag, Cartier or Rolex is good. Movado is passable. Timex is for the gym only. Of course, wear your wedding and engagement rings if applicable. Beyond these essential pieces, be very careful what you add.

, For example, typical everyday make-up would be: Foundation/Concealer (only if you need it), Brow pencil/shadow (if you don't have luscious full eyebrows), Mascara - you may need waterproof for when you're surfing, a bit of blush, bronzer and lip balm - preferably with SPF.

, You will obviously get fit from surfing, so there isn't too much to worry about. Why not try pilates, yoga and meditation classes? Dancing, or any sport to be honest, is fine. You might like skateboarding, too.

, Have the hippie spirit, and always give things a go. You never know what you could be missing out on!

Find beauty in darkness.",How to Get a Dark and Romantic Look," Listen, think about what you are going to say next. Take awhile. Do talk, just speak thoughtfully. Again, think before you speak. Is that comment really necessary? Has that question already been answered? Will that statement actually lead to a proper conversation?


Train your mind to ask these questions before you open your mouth and you’ll be surprised at how much quieter you’ll become.;
, Moi dix mois is good, also Kanon Wakeshima. People that are dark romantics tend to listen to softer, deeper music. Look for things with meaningful lyrics and instruments. One very popular genre with Romantic Goths is classical music. You can also go for offbeat art rock, like Kate Bush. However, you don’t have to go by the rules. Anything deep and emotional or anything that is soft and dreamy is just as good.

, Wear a lot of lace and vintage. That's very romantic. Try making the colors darker. NO NEON! Do wear colors, this will give you a softer edge and also make you more approachable. For example, if you want to wear pink, wear a dark pink with matching lipstick and dark eyes.

, Dark red lipstick is always great paired with dark eyeliner and lots of mascara. This gives a classic look. If you want to go softer, wear soft pink lipstick and a smokey eye or lots of black eyeliner and mascara. Pale out your skin. Stay indoors a lot and if you do go out, wear SPF 30 and above. Hats are your best friend. Wear different ones. When your skin is pale and blemish free, use a fair CC cream and a shimmery translucent powder everywhere. Contour lightly.

, Chokers are awesome with this look. Try not to make it look goth though. Other necklaces, bracelets, dark earrings, and chunky rings with either dark stones or all silver.

, A lot. One thing dark romantic are famous for is their love of reading. They are great lovers of romance, romantic tragedies and classic favourites. If you’re willing, dive right in and experiment with reading classics. If you don’t think you can handle them, try reading romance, tragedy or even just dramas. Romantic literature is softer and dreamier than the other styles of Goth literature. If you’re looking for something a little heavier, try supernatural themes, or stories including characters such as Vampires and Werewolves. Some suggested titles and authors include:


Shakespeare - Although this will probably seem strange, Shakespeare is incredibly popular. Charlotte Brontë -Jane Eyre. Jane Eyre, while not being particularly dark, is romantic, tragic and dramatic and therefore fulfills all of the qualities of a good dark romantic novel. Edgar Allan Poe - A 19th century poet, short story writer and literary critic, best known for his macabre tales, contributing greatly to the science fiction and horror genres. Emily Brontë -Wuthering Heights. Wuthering Heights is sorrowful, tragic and romantic as well. Read poetry. This will make you seem insightful and mysterious.

, Although this step seems obvious, it takes a lot of work. If you’re obnoxious, loud and clumsy, you are going to find it hard to pass off as a dark romantic. Try to appreciate the beauty in life and everything around you. Think outside the box and spread your love to the people who surround you. It isn’t hard to find the romance in everyday life. It’s already there - you just have to open your eyes

, One of the major talents that dark romantic possess is that they are able to find the magic and the beauty in gothic styles and darkness. But there are many hidden beauties in this particular lifestyle. Listen to the lyrics and feel the words in dark songs and writings - feel the emotion. Open your mind.

Determine your body type.,
Find accessories that match your scale.,
Pay attention to where it draws attention to.,
Find shoes that match your body shape.,
Get the right size of belt.,
Necklaces, rings and bracelets follow the same criteria mentioned above.",How to Find Accessories for Your Body Shape," To find the right bags, belts, necklaces and other accessories for your body shape, you first have to figure out what body type you actually have. There are lots of designations for body types. Some stylists mention that there are 4 body types, other say there are more. Whatever the number of body shapes, the most important thing you should know is that body types are basically the ratio between your bust, waist and hip measurements. Once you have those measurements you can easily find out what your shape is by entering those measurements in an online body shape calculator.;
, If you’re petite, you don’t want to have accessories bigger than you, because it will make you look shorter. On the other hand, if you’re bigger, you don’t want to carry around a small bag that will just make you look bigger. It’s all about finding the right proportion for you.

, If you’re a pear shaped body type, you’re probably trying to draw attention away from your hip zone. If, for example, you are wearing a crossed over bag that will hang around your hips, that will definitely draw attention to that area. In this case, you might consider looking for satchels to carry around your shoulders to draw attention to your upper body.

, If you thought that shoes didn’t influence your overall proportion you got it wrong, because shoes can also draw attention to your legs. For example, ankle strap shoes will definitely make your legs seem shorter and wider and you’re carrying some weight in the bottom that won’t do justice for your frame. In that case, you should go for leather boots, classic pumps or ballet flats without any strong details that draw unnecessary attention to your legs. Meanwhile, if you’re petite, you should avoid wearing chunky footwear.

, Belts should we worn according to the length of your torso. If you’re petite and have a smaller torso, you should look for narrower belts that will enhance your waist without adding unnecessary attention to your smaller torso. Also, if you are pear shaped you also don’t want to draw attention to your hips with wide belts. Again, finding the right belts should meet the criteria above of “scale” and “where does it draw attention to”.

, Have slim wrists and want to show them off? Simply draw attention to that area by wearing a bracelet. Want to show off your awesome long neck? Use a pair of long earrings and balance it with a necklace.

Understand that sensitive skin is very common.,
Identify what triggers your sensitive skin, and avoid these whenever whenever possible.,
Select appropriate cosmetics and skin care agents for your skin.Using the wrong products can worsen your sensitive skin, so it is best to get a handle on what works for you before attempting to add acne treatments.,
Start by washing your face (and any other areas with acne) twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.,
Use separate face cloths each time.,
Try a moisturizing cream.,
Be conscientious with your diet.,
Be persistent.,
Ask your doctor about topical creams and/or ointments.,
Try the birth control pill if you are a female who struggles with acne and sensitive skin.,
Learn about antibiotics that can help with acne.,
Inquire about other medical options with your doctor.",How to Deal With Acne when You Have Sensitive Skin," In medical studies, nearly half of the population has been shown to have characteristics of sensitive skin. These include redness and/or abnormal stinging, tingling, or burning sensations that occur in response to certain triggers (which can vary from person to person).


If you have very sensitive skin with redness and bumps, particularly if you are a woman over 20, you may have a common skin condition called rosacea.This skin condition is also common in people who have had acne.There are several subtypes of rosacea, so it’s best to see a dermatologist if your skin is very sensitive and prone to redness.;
, Triggers are highly variable between people, and it takes experience to find out what causes your skin to become irritated (it will be different for each person). Triggers may include:


particular weather (such as sun, heat, wind, and/or cold)
certain cosmetics
certain soaps
stress
your menstrual cycle (for females), although this one cannot be avoided.

, Avoid products that contain alcohol, menthol, or “exfoliating” agents. These can irritate skin and make acne worse.In general, using fewer products on your skin is better.
Look for products that are labeled ""hypoallergenic"" at the drug store or pharmacy. Or, ones with fewer ingredients (and more natural ingredients) tend to be a better bet.
Always observe the response of your skin to various cosmetics and soaps. Go by trial and error and eliminate those that cause you trouble.

, Use something mild like Dove Unscented Soap, or a specific mild acne cleansing agent from the pharmacy or that your doctor recommends.


Washing your face (and any other areas with acne) is important to diminish the oil on the skin. However, you want to be careful to use mild cleansing agents to not dry out your skin too much, since you already have sensitive skin.
If you are choosing an acne product from the pharmacy, look for something where the label says ""hypoallergenic,"" or ask the pharmacist there for recommendations for sensitive skin.
Use warm water (not hot) for washing as this tends to be less irritating to the skin.
Also do not pick or pop pimples as this can lead to scarring, infection, and/or worsening of your acne.

, You want to be sure that the face cloth you use is clean each time, as re-using old ones reintroduces bacteria to the face. Be sure also to rub gently (and not scrub hard) to minimize irritation to your skin upon washing.

, Many acne treatments can result in drier skin, so especially for those with sensitive skin, regular moisturizing is an important preventative measure to avoid your skin becoming overly irritated with acne treatments. When picking a moisturizing cream from the drug store or pharmacy, look for one that is labeled ""hypoallergenic"" (for sensitive skin) and ""non-comedogenic"" (suitable for people with acne, meaning that it won't contribute to worsening your acne).

, Limit sugar and refined carbohydrates (such as white bread, pasta, and white rice) as these contribute to worse acne.


The American Journal of Nutrition published a study showing that whole grains, beans, and veggies are better food choices for people with acne. Also, drinking plenty of water throughout the day to stay well-hydrated (at least 8 cups per day, and more with exercise) can help to improve acne.

, Most acne treatments take at least 2-3 months to make a noticeable difference. So it is important to be determined and willing to put in the effort to see results!


Also, for people such as you with sensitive skin, it can take even longer to notice a difference...so hang in there! Consistent efforts do pay off.

, There are a variety that can be applied directly to the areas of skin with acne and can help to reduce or eliminate the acne. Let your doctor know that you have sensitive skin, and he or she will likely recommend that you start with a smaller amount at less frequent intervals (perhaps every other day, rather than every day). Then, if you have trouble due to your sensitive skin, you can stop the treatment without having caused too much irritation to your skin. Or, if it is going well, you can increase the amount and/or frequency to what your doctor recommends.

, Any birth control pill that contains estrogen and progesterone will reduce and improve acne,although certain pills may work better for some women than others.Also, given that it is taken as a pill (rather than applied directly to the skin), it is an excellent choice for girls and women with sensitive skin. The birth control pill provides the added benefit of contraception and reducing menstrual cramping and bleeding, if this is something you are looking for as well.
Pills with more estrogen (each type of pill has varying amounts of estrogen and progesterone) tend to be more effective with acne, but they also carry more risk, so talk to your doctor about these options.Always talk to your doctor first as certain pills and IUDs can actually worsen acne (those with less estrogen). All birth control pills have some level of risk, which is higher if you are a woman who smokes, is overweight, or has certain other medical problems., Antibiotics such as doxycycline or minocycline are often taken in pill form as a treatment for acne. Since acne is related to bacteria on the skin, diminishing the amount of bacteria can in turn improve acne. It can also help reduce inflammation, which causes the red bumps and pimples associated with acne.Since antibiotics are taken in pill form, they are also an easier option for those with sensitive skin (as they will not irritate your skin).
Some antibiotics such as the ones commonly used for acne treatments can result in skin sensitivity to the sun. Always wear sunscreen if you are taking these antibiotics during summer or in a warm sunny climate.
Be aware of side effects that may occur when taking these antibiotics, including vaginal yeast infections in women and/or an upset stomach.

, If the above suggestions have not worked for you, there are some more treatment options available via a dermatologist (a medical doctor who specializes in skin care). However, most of these other options are more challenging to tolerate with sensitive skin, particularly due to the drying effects they can have on skin. If in doubt, it is always best to get the professional opinion of a dermatologist as to how best to proceed in your particular case.One newer and emerging option is something called ""light therapy."" There have been many successes shown, although more studies are needed in this area. Talk to your dermatologist to see if this might be an option for you. Another treatment option is laser therapy.While it may not be a good choice for people with extremely sensitive skin, it can be helpful in reducing acne and acne scars. You should discuss this option with your dermatologist to see if it is right for you."

Learn about the healing properties of nutmeg.,
Choose a non-comedogenic oil.,
Make a nutmeg paste.,
Try alternate pastes.,
Prepare your skin.,
Apply the paste.,
Wash your skin clear.",How to Clear Pimples and Facial Marks with a Natural Indian Treatment1," Though you may think of it as a delicious spice, nutmeg has had many non-food uses throughout history, including use as treatment for diarrhea, nausea, and stomach upset. Nutmeg is anti-inflammatory and has a mild antibacterial property, and can be used in topical applications to help fight Propionibacterium acnes, the bacteria on your skin that causes inflamed acne.Nutmeg’s anti-inflammatory properties likely come from its myristicin, eugenol, and isoeugenol.You should note that nutmeg is still considered less effective than standard treatments for acne, such as clindamycin.Any nutmeg powder will work fine for this treatment, but it should be fresh to ensure that its properties are most effective. You can also use nutmeg essential oil.;
, ""Non-comedogenic"" just means that the product won't clog pores and promote acne. According to the American Academy of Dermatology, the most non-comedogenic oils are mineral oil, shea butter, and sunflower oil.Castor oil is slightly comedogenic, but still ultimately harmless to the skin.


Highly comedogenic oils that you should avoid putting on acne-prone skin include coconut oil, sesame oil, cocoa butter, and avocado oil.Coconut oil does contain lauric acid, which is effective at combating the skin bacteria P.acnes that is responsible for inflamed acne (pus, pimples, etc.). However, coconut oil does not dissolve well in water, so it is difficult to completely cleanse your skin of it after you apply it., Mix two teaspoons of nutmeg powder with the non-comedogenic oil you chose. Only use enough oil to make a thick paste — it should not be watery. Add a few drops of lemon juice to the mixture. The lemon juice is used to lighten any darker areas of the skin. This combination of nutmeg, oil, and lemon juice is used to treat pimples and reduce scars and marks on the skin.If you don’t have a non-comedogenic oil in your pantry, you can replace it with honey. The honey is antibacterial and can help heal blemishes., Instead of nutmeg, you might use two teaspoons of ground cinnamon, ground fenugreek leaves or ground orange peels with your chosen oil/honey and lemon. Two teaspoons of turmeric mixed with neem oil is another wonderful option, as neem oil has astringent, antiseptic, and antibacterial properties and turmeric is an antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant herb.Garlic has many antibacterial, antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties.A traditional Ayurvedic skin treatment calls for you to crush 2-3 cloves of garlic into a paste and apply it directly to your face.Mix in some plain yogurt before applying it if you have sensitive skin.
All of these alternatives to the nutmeg paste should follow the same application steps listed below.

, Before applying the paste, you want to make sure you’re working with a clean canvas. Using a gentle cleanser, wash your face to clear away excess surface oil and debris.


Do not use products that contain alcohol, as they dry your skin and can make acne worse. Use a gentle cleanser such as Cetaphil or Aveeno.
Do not use exfoliating brushes or other implements. Gently massage the cleanser into your skin using your fingertips. Rinse well with warm (not hot) water and pat your face dry with a clean towel.

, You don’t need to smear the paste all over your face, as you might with a mud mask or home-facial peel. Instead, use a Q-tip to dot the paste onto problem areas on your skin, where you have either blemishes or scars/discolorations that need treatment. Leave the paste in place for at least 2 hours.


Consider applying the paste before you go to bed, and letting it treat your skin while you sleep overnight.
If you make the paste in larger quantities, you can use it as a facial wash or scrub, applying it to your entire face.

, Once you’ve allowed the nutmeg paste to do its work, you can wash it away. Simply rinse it off with lukewarm water, and pat your skin dry. Make sure not to rub your face with the towel, as that could irritate your skin.

Try Sunder Vati.,
Try an Ayurvedic combination treatment.,
Apply tea tree oil.",How to Clear Pimples and Facial Marks with a Natural Indian Treatment2," Several clinical trials have demonstrated that Sunder Vati is one of the most effective of the Ayurvedic acne treatments. It is taken orally.It may also be prepared as an ointment or gel.You can usually find this preparation from a homeopath, but you can also ask your doctor to find out how to find an effective preparation. Sunder Vati includes the following ingredients:Ginger
Kutaj (Holarrhena antidysenterica)
Biranga (Embelia ribes)
Indian gooseberry
Aloe
Turmeric
Guggulu

, Studies have suggested that trying a poly-herbal topical ointment, Shalmalyadilepa, and an oral treatment, Guduchyadivati, may be effective in reducing acne. Consult with an Ayurvedic medical practitioner.Shalmalyadilepa contains Shalmali thorn (Salmalia malabarica), Vata buds (Ficus bengalensis), Jaatiphala fruits (Myristica fragrans), Lodhra bark (Symplocos racemosa), Massora seed (Lens culinaris), and Raktachandana (Pterocarpus santalinus).

Guduchyadivati contains equal parts Guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia), Manjistha (Rubia cordifolia), and Krishnasariva (Hemidesmus indicus)., Tea Tree, Melaleuca alternifolia, is a native Australian tree that has been widely used in Aboriginal medicine. Studies also show that it is highly effective at combating acne when applied in a 5% solution once a day for three months.Tea Tree oil takes a little longer to work than other acne treatments, such as benzoyl peroxide, but it also has fewer unpleasant side effects (e.g., itching, dryness, or irritation).
If you want the treatment to work a little faster, apply the oil to your skin twice a day, for 20 minutes per treatment. Wash your skin afterward with a gentle cleanser. Do this treatment regimen for 45 days.Do not consume tea tree oil. It is toxic when ingested."
"
Make washing a regular part of your routine.,
Use a gentle, plant-oil based cleansing product.,
Use your fingertips to wash your face.,
Massage the skin gently.You may be tempted to scrub at your skin during your daily washing, but this is a bad idea.,
Avoid exfoliation.Exfoliation can be good for healthy skin, but you shouldn't try to exfoliate acne-covered skin.,
Do not ever pop your pimples.Pimples, pustules, blackheads, and so on may look unattractive, but they’re actually working to keep the bacteria in your skin contained.",How to Clear Pimples and Facial Marks with a Natural Indian Treatment3," Wash your face at least twice a day — once when you wake up to clear away oils that accumulate on the skin during sleep, and once before sleep to wash away the day's accumulation.You should also wash your face after periods of heavy sweating, whether you've gone to the gym or just been outside on a warm day. Take a bath at least once a day, and consider taking an extra shower after heavy sweating., Look for a cleanser labeled as “non-comedogenic.”This means that the product doesn’t promote the formation of comedones (blackheads or whiteheads) or pimples.


Many brands — such Neutrogena, Cetaphil, and Olay — produce non-comedogenic products. There are also many off-brand or store-brand non-comedogenic products.
You can also look for non-comedogenic oils to dissolve skin oils and clean the skin. Always read the packaging to be certain. Popular non-comedogenic oils include hemp seed oil, shea butter, sunflower oil, and castor oil.
Avoid products that have alcohol in them, as it dries out and damages the skin. The dried, dead skin cells clog the pores, actually making acne worse., If you use a washcloth or sponge to work cleansers into your skin, reconsider that practice. These products are rough against your skin, can irritate it, causing more problems than they solve. Instead, use your fingertips to massage cleansers into your skin., The cause of your acne lies under the skin, and you cannot treat it through scrubbing, which only irritates the skin and worsens surface inflammation. Using your fingertips, gently massage the cleanser into your skin for 10 seconds or less, taking care not to irritate existing acne.

, It can cause both micro-scarring that can't be seen without magnification, and more obvious scarring.It can also pull away skin that's not yet ready to fall off, like pulling off a scab before it's ready. This can lead to scarring and discoloration.


Chemical exfoliants detach the dead and dying skin cells, but can be drying and irritating as well.
These over-the-counter treatments are different than the dermabrasion performed by dermatologists. A dermatologist uses techniques like laser resurfacing and microdermabrasion under magnification. They direct the treatment towards specific, very small areas, not the entire face. Professional treatments may not cause discoloration.

, When you pop a zit, the white pus that comes out and touches your skin spreads the very bacteria that causes acne.


If you absolutely must get rid of a pimple, see a dermatologist to lance it in a sterile, professional environment. At home, though, it’s best to simply let your zit run its course. Popping it might cause acne to flare up, lengthen the healing time, and increase scarring and discoloration.
In serious cases, picking or popping a pimple can cause a severe staph infection.

Learn the importance of underlying causes.,
Control androgen levels, if possible.,
Raise your fatty acid levels.Omega-3 fatty acids protect your skin by limiting the body’s production of leukotriene B4.,
Treat inflammations that can become acne.,
Avoid foods that cause outbreaks.,
Quit smoking.,
Choose cosmetics and beauty treatments carefully.,
Protect your skin from the sun.",How to Clear Pimples and Facial Marks with a Natural Indian Treatment4," You can treat skin blemishes all you want, but if you don't treat the thing that's causing it, acne will keep coming back. Now, this can't always be done. For example, if you're a teenager, your acne is likely a result of the fluctuating hormone levels that come with puberty, which can't be stopped until you outgrow it. You can also inherit a predisposition for acne from your parents, which can't be helped.However, there are many things that cause acne that can be helped, and you should take measures to avoid those behaviors.

, Androgens are a family of hormones that includes testosterone, which is produced by both men and women (though in higher levels in men).Testosterone increases the body's production of sebum, an oil that moistens the skin and keep it healthy. But when you have too much testosterone, the body makes more sebum than it can expel, making sebum accumulate and clog the skin. This can lead to inflammation and acne.Teenaged acne in both boys and girls is often due to increased androgens. Unfortunately, it's often worse in boys, who have higher levels, and the underlying cause is untreatable until they outgrow puberty.
Teenaged girls, though, can take prescription birth control to regulate their hormones, and therefore their sebum production.Steroid use also affects androgens and sebum production. Stopping steroid use will likely improve the skin.

, Leukotriene B4 is known to increase sebum production and lead to inflammatory acne. By bringing your Omega-3 fatty acid levels up, you can prevent uncontrolled production of leukotriene B4 and help prevent acne. Foods you should look for include


Walnuts
Avocados
Flaxseeds and flaxseed oil
Fatty fish (halibut, herring, mackerel, oysters, salmon, sardines, trout, tuna)Leafy green vegetables
Foods and drinks fortified with omega-3 fatty acids (check the packaging)

, Conventional thought on acne has been that its primary cause is bacterial, and it progresses to inflammation. However, recent research suggests that inflammation may actually lie at the heart of acne at all stages, not just late stages.The presence of bacteria, this research argues, only serves to make skin conditions worse.


Talk to your dermatologist about getting a prescription for anti-inflammatory medication to treat the underlying problem, rather than just treating the acne itself.

, Everyone’s body reacts differently to food. Your friends might be able to eat foods that make you break out, and not get a single pimple. Take note of which foods seem to trigger acne in your body, and take lengths to either reduce or eliminate those foods from your diet. Foods with a high “GI” (glycemic index) ranking may make acne worse.High-GI foods to watch out for include:


Processed foods such as white bread, bakery products, potato chips, and french fries. These are usually “simple” carbohydrates that don’t offer much nutrition. Choose low-GI foods such as whole oatmeal, whole-grain bread, vegetables, and beans. If you crave potatoes, sweet potatoes and yams are lower-GI than white potatoes.Sugar. Your body’s ability to regulate blood sugar may be linked to acne. High-GI foods and beverages often contain significant amounts of sugar.
Dairy products. Dairy is not as strongly linked to acne as high-GI foods, but some studies suggest a connection. The American Academy of Dermatology does not recommend eliminating dairy products from your diet unless advised by your doctor, as they also contain essential nutrients such as calcium and vitamin D.Choose lower-GI dairy products such as reduced fat yogurt over high-GI products such as ice cream., Research suggests a link between cigarette smoking and adult-onset, non-inflammatory acne, called “smoker’s acne.”Though more studies need to be conducted on this link, a recent study of women found a direct correlation between the number of cigarettes smoked and the severity of acne. Reducing or eliminating cigarette smoking from your routine may be able to improve your acne.

, Some cosmetics cause cells to build up in the hair follicles, causing black- or whiteheads that can become inflamed. This condition, called “acne cosmetica” or “cosmetic acne,” can be easily avoided by putting a little thought into what beauty products you put on your skin.Look for non-comedogenic makeups that won’t clog your skin up, and avoid beauty products that have heavy perfumes in them.
Avoid lotions and makeups that include penetrating oils like lanolin or isopropyl myristate, which can also trigger acne.

, A popular myth suggests that a tan can help treat and prevent acne, but scientists have found no evidence to support that.In fact, both the sun and tanning beds damage your skin and raise your risk for cancer. Always wear sunscreen and stay out of the sun during peak hours (10AM to 4PM).Be aware that some acne medications or other types of medication can actually make your skin even more sensitive to the sun. These drugs include antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim; antihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benadryl); drugs used to treat cancer (5-FU, vinblastine, dacarbazine); heart drugs like amiodarone, nifedipine, quinidine and diltiazem; Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like naproxen and the acne medications isotretinoin (Accutane) and acitretin (Soriatane).

This hairstyle is ideal for women with fine, straight hair. For those ladies, it's a wash-and-go cut. But the modern bob is surprisingly versatile, working with almost every hair texture.



 


While Katie Holmes, Victoria Beckham and Paris Hilton have very different hair types, they have very similar styles.






Unless your hair is very curly, you should be able to pull off this look.





;
, Paris Hilton's hair is a grown-up, polished look; it is a chin-length bob revamped with a steep angle that frames the face.

, Clean lines are the key to this cut. Your stylist should start by cutting a foundation layer at the base of your neck, then bring the hair layer by layer down to that point.


When the cut is complete, the stylist uses a razor to provide texture. This gives the cut a softer, modern edge.







, Paris Hilton keeps her hair like her credit cards - platinum. Her blonde base color and blonde highlights are relatively high maintenance. To achieve this baby blonde color, it's best if your hair is blonde to light brown. If your hair is medium to dark brown, you'll be in the salon every three to four weeks for touch-ups. Consider using a French highlighting technique called balayage, for natural, sun-kissed highlights. But if your stylist is not experienced with balayage, foil highlighting will work as well.

,

To achieve a sleek, sophisticated blow-dry like Paris Hilton, you'll need a paddle brush with thick bristles. Look for a brush that combines natural boar bristles and synthetic bristles to pull the hair straight.







Add volume as needed. If your hair is fine, use a volumizing mousse. Then towel dry your hair to remove excess moisture. If it's wavy or thick, skip the mousse and start blow-drying right away, using your brush.







, Do not bend the hair with the brush or pull the hair under; unless you want to look like a news anchor. Simply pull the hair straight with your brush while holding the blow dryer at an angle.

, Because your hair hangs differently when dry, a good stylist will always perfect a cut after the blow-dry. Ask your stylist to look for any stray hairs and check the line a final time.


While the razor works wonders on wet hair, it should never be used on dry hair. In the finish, a stylist will snip with scissors only.






If you have any wavy pieces, quickly run a flat iron through them. Use a comb with the flat iron to remove any knots and minimize hair damage.







, For that sleek and sexy, side-swept bob, you'll need some pomade. Rub a bit of pomade into your hands and then work it through the ends of your hair. Keep it off the roots to avoid it looking greasy.

, It can take some getting used to having shorter hair but the benefits are a lighter feel, a new sense of style and sharing a hairstyle with a number of celebrities!

Obtain your tools.,
Ensure that you have a quiet space.,
Wash and dry your hair.,
Section the hair that you do not want to cut.,
Cover your shoulders.",How to Trim Bangs Between Haircuts1," You will need a fine-tooth comb and sharp hair-cutting scissors for trimming bangs. You will also need bobby pins and/or hair ties to tie or pin your hair back. This will ensure that you do not accidentally cut a section of hair you did not intend to cut.If you already have hair-cutting scissors, make sure that the pair you have are sharp. If not, you will need to get them sharpened. You can sharpen them at home, find a sharpening service in your area, or send them back to the manufacturer for sharpening if they offer it.;
, Cutting your own hair requires focus and precision. You will want to make sure that you have some quiet time to yourself to perform this task. Budget about half an hour in your schedule to devote solely to trimming your bangs.


Avoid being in a rush. Make sure that you have plenty of down time and do not have to be somewhere before trimming your bangs. This is not a process that you want to rush.

, You will always want to trim your bangs while they are dry. This is because wet hair is longer and hair shrinks as it dries. Cutting your bangs while they are wet will leave you with bangs that are shorter than you intended., Use a fine-tooth comb to separate your bangs from the rest of your hair. Pull the rest of it back into a ponytail or pin the rest back with clips. Make sure that any sections of your hair that you do not want to cut are safely pulled back or pinned.

, The small hairs that fall as you trim can be itchy and difficult to brush off the skin. Drape a towel around your shoulders. Secure the towel in place with some hair clips. Hair clips can be obtained at any drugstore or beauty supply store near you.

Divide your bangs in half vertically.,
Begin trimming.,
Trim the other side of your bangs.,
Brush out your bangs.",How to Trim Bangs Between Haircuts2," You will have a right section and a left section. It is almost impossible to cut all of your bangs at once, especially if you have an especially thick set of bangs. You should separate your bangs into sections and trim them one section at a time. Be mindful of the length of each section as you are cutting to prevent trimming uneven bangs., Comb out your bangs with a fine-tooth comb, stopping just short of your brow bone or the desired cut length. Hold this section of your bangs with your fingers, right above where you stopped the comb. You can now move the comb away. Hold your scissors and use them to trim the hairs at a 45 degree angle, rather than cutting straight across. Trim less than you think you need, as it is easier to trim a bit more than it is to have to grow your bangs out.


Trimming the hair with the scissors at this angle will prevent the bangs from looking too blunt and unnatural.
As you are trimming, be sure to trim in a straight line, even though your scissors are at a 45 degree angle, so that your bangs aren’t uneven. Slowly and carefully trim the bangs until you finish the section.

, Unclip the other side of your bangs and comb them out, stopping just short of the brow bone or desired length. Hold the scissors at a 45 degree angle and begin slowly and carefully trimming the hair until you have finished the sections.

, Look for any hairs that you may have missed or any uneven places. Trim anything else that may need to be trimmed or was missed.

Comb the hair back that you do not want to trim.,
Gather your bangs and twist them once to face your dominant hand.,
Trim your bangs, starting with the shortest end.,
Make very small cuts upward into the bangs.",How to Trim Bangs Between Haircuts3," Use the finely pointed end of your comb to evenly part your bangs, making sure that the parted line of your bangs are straight. Comb your bangs forward. Tie or pin the hair that you are not trimming back.

, You can skip this step if the ends of your bangs fall alongside your dominant side. Twisting the bangs will allow you to easily cut your bangs if they fall opposite your dominant side. For example, if you are right handed and your bangs swoop across from the left side of your face, you will need to twist the bangs to face your right hand in order to comfortably trim them with your right hand. It is never a good idea to trim bangs with your non-dominant hand as you could make mistakes. Once they are twisted, comb out the section below the twist to work out any tangles., Beginning at the top (the shortest part of your bangs), cut the ends of the bangs at a 45 degree angle. Make very small cuts, and trim less than you think you need.

, To make the cut look less blunt and more natural, cut upward into the bangs, taking care not to cut too much off. You will only be taking a very small amount of hair off at this point. Part your bangs down the middle and cut one half first, then move to the other. When finished, brush them out and make small cuts into the bangs as one single piece.

Divide your bangs into three parts.,
Comb out the middle section.,
Trim the right and left sections.",How to Trim Bangs Between Haircuts4," There will be a middle section, a right section, and a left section. This is because the left and right sections are slightly longer than the center section. Pin back the other two sections as you trim but be sure to not to get it mixed up with the rest of your hair., Stop just above where you would like to trim. Hold the scissors at a 45 degree angle and begin make short cuts into the bangs, taking care not to cut them too short. This will make the trim look more natural.

, Take a small bit of the middle section to use as a guide for trimming the side sections. Begin trimming at a 45 degree angle, gradually moving downward to create a gentle slope. This will make the side sections a bit longer than the center section, giving a fun, whimsical look to your bangs.

Use bobby pins to ""create"" bangs.",How to Tell if Your Face Is Well Suited to Bangs," These bangs are styled like the name would imply – the flow over the forehead to one side of your face. The best types of side-swept bangs for round faces are thick and full, rather than thin and wispy. These will add a bit of shape and dimension to a round face.To figure out if you have a round face, measure across your upper cheeks (from the outer corner of each eye) and your face length (from your hair to your chin).
If these two measurements are pretty equal and you don’t have a sharp jawline, your face is round.;
, Heart-shaped faces are wider at the top and become narrower and pointed at the bottom, just like a heart. Bangs that are a bit wispier will soften this face shape.Bangs that are a bit longer on the sides will also help to soften up the more sharper chin., Square faces are a bit more angular than others, so the key is getting bangs that will soften everything up. Bangs that softly split down the middle work really well for square faces because their slanted “A” shape breaks up the sharper lines of the face.As for length, ask for bangs that hit your eyebrows and no longer., Oval faces are pretty easy to work with, because it’s the face shape most people actually desire. That being said, blunt, straight-across bangs can particularly flatter oval faces. Because your face is longer, the blunt bangs don’t overwhelm your entire face., The shape of your face is the biggest thing to consider when you’re toying with the idea of bangs, but the size of your forehead should also come into consideration. If you have a small forehead, side-swept bangs can make it look a bit bigger and more proportionate.If you have a larger forehead, parted, wispy bangs can disguise a bit of the length while softening the shape., It’s particularly helpful if you can find pictures of people with similar face shapes and hair types! Save a few photos on your phone or bring them with you so you can make sure the hairstylist knows what you are looking for.

, If you’re unsure if your face is well suited for bangs, the best thing you can do is talk to a professional. Hairstylists want you to be happy with their service, so they will offer you good advice about what to do. They have experience cutting and styling all types of hair, so they will be able to answer your questions and help you figure out what type of bangs will work best.

, For bangs to look their best, they will likely need to be styled. After all, they are front and center when you’re speaking to people, so you want them to look polished. If you’re a fan of rolling out of bed every morning and barely touching your hair, they might not be the best option for you. Additionally, you’ll need to make time to get regular trims., There are many hair apps available that allow you to upload your own image and then edit different hairstyles, hair colors and/or bangs on to it. These apps can give you a very good idea of what bangs will look like on you. You can experiment with different types of bangs until you find something that best complements your specific features., You can buy these either at a beauty supply store or online and they come in a wide variety of shades and styles. Pick up the clip-in bangs style you're considering, then part your hair down the middle, slide the piece in and secure it with the three clips.This is probably the closest you'll be able to get to the real thing without actually getting a cut, so wear the piece around a few days and see how you feel about it.

, If you have a particular style of bangs in mind, use bobby pins to arrange your hair into that fringe, then pin the fringe in place. For example, if you want side-swept bangs, pin your hair back so that it looks like you have them, then check out how it looks on you.

When you're rough with your hair, it can frizz up and start looking dull. Hair is a fragile material that should be handled with care, just like a delicate piece of fabric. Here's what to keep in mind:


When you shampoo your hair don't roughly scrub it. Massage the shampoo into your hair and distribute it with your fingers.
Rinse your conditioner in the coldest water you can stand. The cold temperature seals the cuticle and helps your hair look shiny, while hot water will cause it to frizz up and look dull.
Gently squeeze the water from your hair and pat it dry with a towel instead of twisting and wringing it out.;
, Shampooing your hair every single day causes it to dry out and become brittle. The natural oil your scalp produces to nourish your hair gets rinsed away before it can do its job. If you want your hair to stay healthy and shiny, you only really need to wash it once or twice a week, depending on your hair type.When you first cut back on how often you wash your hair, you may notice it looking oilier than normal. Your scalp is producing oil on overdrive since it's used to everyday washings. After a week or two things will balance out and your hair will look cleaner, longer.
On days in between washings, when you need to perk up your hair, try dry shampoo. It's a powder you sprinkle, or an aerosol you spray, on your hair to absorb the oil, and it works like a charm.

, The best way to keep your hair healthy is to let it dry naturally instead of using a hair dryer. The heat from the hair dryer damages the hair shaft, and if you do it every day you'll definitely see damage over time. Put that hair dryer away and let your hair dry the natural way.


The same goes for other heat styling tools, like curling irons, straightening irons, and hot rollers.
On days when you do want to use a hair dryer or other styling tools, apply a heat protectant serum to your hair so it doesn't get quite as damaged.

, Running a plastic-bristled brush through your hair, especially when it's wet, is almost guaranteed to cause some damage. Brushing tends to rip your hair, while combing removes the tangles without pulling it out. Use a wide-tooth comb and work out the tangles starting close to the tips and moving up to the roots.

, Dyeing, bleaching, chemically straightening, and chemically curling your hair all damage the shaft. For the healthiest possible hair, it's best to stop these treatments and let your hair take on its natural color and texture. Your hair might not be the exact color you want, but it will be healthy, shiny and silky.


If you do want to dye your hair, look into henna, honey, or tea dyeing. These natural dyes actually restore shine to your hair, rather than damaging it. You won't be able to achieve a dramatic color change, but you can go a few shades lighter or darker.

, Waves, wefts, dreads, and other styles that require permanently pulling your hair into a tight position can cause damage and hair loss. While some types of weaves are less damaging than others (sewn weaves are usually better than glue-ins, for example) your hair will be healthier if you forego them altogether.

, Use just enough conditioner to coat the strands of your hair without completely weighing it down. Apply the conditioner an inch or so from your roots and use a wide-toothed comb to comb it down to the tips. Rinse the conditioner with cool water for a shiny finish.


If your hair tends to get very dry, try using a leave-in conditioner as well. Apply the conditioner after you get out of the shower, while your hair is still damp. It will keep your hair soft and supple until your next shampoo.

, Deep conditioning treatments are a great way to make your hair look silkier and shinier. Since the treatments are so effective, you only need to do them once every week or two. Use a store-bought deep conditioner or a household oil like coconut oil, olive oil, or almond oil. Complete the treatment as follows:


Dampen your hair and apply about a tablespoon of the deep conditioner. Use a wide-toothed comb to distribute it throughout your hair.
Put your hair in a high bun or ponytail at the top of your head. Cover with a shower cap or plastic wrap.
Leave the conditioner in for at least an hour and up to eight hours.
Shampoo your hair as normal to remove excess conditioner.

, On days when you don't have time for a deep conditioning treatment but you want to give your hair an extra lift, try using a household product to enhance your hair's texture and appearance. After you wet your hair in the shower, apply a hair mask. Shampoo it out at the end of your shower. Here are homemade masks that make hair shiny and silky:


One tablespoon of honey or one egg white
One blended banana or avocado
One tablespoon of milk or yogurt
A combination of any of the above ingredients

, If your hair tends to get frizzy and dull, hair oil or serum will smooth it down and protect it from the elements during the day. Put a few drops on your fingertips and run the serum through your hair, focusing on the tips. Look for hair serum or oil that contains one of the following nourishing ingredients:Argan oil
Moroccan oil
Jojoba oil

, Most brushes are unhealthy for hair, but boar bristle brushes are specially designed to make your hair shiny and smooth. The bristles are the same texture as human hair, and they pull your hair's natural oil from the roots to the tips for a nourishing conditioning treatment. These brushes also stimulate the scalp, which promotes hair growth.


The night or morning before you plan to shampoo your hair, use a wide-tooth comb to remove tangles.
Brush your hair with a boar bristle brush for about 10 minutes to distribute the oils.
Wait at least an hour before shampooing.

, Your diet and other health habits have a big effect on the texture of your hair. When you eat plenty of protein, nutrients, and healthy fats, your hair looks shiny and healthy. When you don't, your hair is the first place it shows. Watch and see how your hair improves when you do the following:


Eat food that contains protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and iron. Salmon, sardines, avocados, nuts, and flaxseeds are all excellent for promoting healthy hair growth.
Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water. When you're dehydrated, your hair can end up getting dry and brittle.
Avoid smoking cigarettes. Smoke damage can make hair look dull and dried out.

, Ingredients in your shampoo and conditioner may be making your hair look dry and dull instead of silky and shiny. Switch to all-natural shampoos and conditioners that nourish your hair instead of stripping its gleam and weighing it down. Here's what to use:Choose sulfate-free shampoo. Sulfates are harsh cleansers used in everything from dish soap to laundry detergent, and people are starting to realize they're not very good for hair. Look for shampoos that say ""sulfate-free"" and are made with natural cleansers.
Sulfate-free shampoos are also good for those with curly and wavy hair, because they help prevent frizz.
Choose a silicone-free conditioner. Silicons are added to conditioner because they make hair look shiny and smooth after the first few applications. Unfortunately, over time they build up in your hair and cause it to look weighed-down and dull. You're better off with silicone-free options.

, Besides feeling great, massage promotes good circulation in the scalp, which helps your hair grow faster and stronger. Do a scalp massage every day, or at least every time you take a shower. Just place your fingers on your scalp and rub it using a gentle circular motion.


To enhance your massage, try using coconut oil, almond oil, or jojoba oil. This is especially beneficial if you're worried about thinning hair.
Tea tree oil, lavender oil or cedar wood oil are also healthy for hair.

, Trim off your split ends regularly to keep your hair in the best of health. Getting regular trims will also make your hair look shinier in appearance, since you're removing the dull, damaged parts. Choose a cut that brings out the best in your hair, and get your locks trimmed every 6-8 weeks.

, Harley has unkempt, rumpled hair. It will be easier to get this look if your hair is slightly curly or wavy. If you have straight hair, use a large curling iron to add loose waves to it. You can also spray your hair with a dry texturizing spray to help give it more volume. Don't worry above making it perfect or neat.

, Secure each pigtail with a hair tie. The pigtails need sit above your eyebrows and slightly behind your ears.Be sure to leave a few strands from your front hairline hanging loose. This is one of the key parts of Harley's look.If you have bangs, consider leaving them out completely., Use blue for the left pigtail and red or light pink for the right. Apply the hairspray from midway-down and be sure to work in small sections. Don't worry about making the color end in a straight line. A little unevenness would work great for Harley.This step can get messy. Wear an old shirt or drape a towel over your shoulders. Wearing plastic gloves might also help., Take a thin strand of hair from under your left pigtail. Wrap it around the base to hide the hair tie, then secure it with a bobby pin. Repeat the process for the right pigtail.Try to finish wrapping the hair strands underneath the pigtails.
You can also wrap a blue ribbon around your left pigtail, and a red ribbon around the right pigtail. Secure them with bobby pins or strips of double-sided tape., This depends on how messy your hair got during the previous steps and how voluminous it is to begin with. If your hair still looks too sleek, backcomb the pigtails from midway down. If your hair is still too thin, backcomb them all the way up to the base, where the hair ties are., If your hair is naturally curly or wavy, the colored hairspray might be enough to hold the style. If your hair is straight or smooth, consider spraying it with a lightweight hairspray to help hold the style.

, Use the handle of a rattail comb to part your hair right in the middle, from your forehead all the way down to the nape of your neck.Harley Quinn does have messy hair, but you will do that at the end. Keep things neat for now.

, The pigtails need to sit right on top of your head, above your eyebrows and behind your ears. Use a comb or brush to smooth the hair down as much as possible. Leave a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) strand of hair hanging loose on each side of your part., Hair chalk can be applied to wet or dry hair, but it will be brighter on dark hair. If you hair is dark blond, brown, or even darker, the hair chalk won't show up very well if you apply it to dry hair. Mist your hair down with a spray bottle filled with water, then comb it through.You only need to dampen your hair about midway down.

, You will need to use bright blue for the left pigtail and light pink or red for the right pigtail. Start adding the colors about midway down.Work with 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) wide sections.If you damped your hair earlier, let it dry before moving on to the next step.
This step can get messy. Consider putting on an old shirt or draping a towel around your shoulders first.

, If you don't do this, the chalk will rub off. Be aware that some color may rub off onto the heat tool, however.If you are using a hair straightener, twist it while straightening your hair so that you get loose waves instead. If you are using a curling iron, try using a larger one instead to get looser curls.This will help set the chalk into your hair and prevent it from rubbing off.


If you don't have a hair straightener or curling iron, you can mist it with hairspray.It won't work as well as a hair straightener or curling iron, but it will be better than nothing.

, Take a strand of hair from the underside of your first pigtail. Wrap it around the base of the pigtail to hide the elastic and weft. Secure the strand of hair with a bobby pin. Repeat this step for the other pigtail. The colored strands will give the illusion of a colored hair tie. Try to finish wrapping the hair strand on the underside of your pigtail.


You can also use a wide, satin ribbon instead. Secure it with a strip of double-sided tape instead of a bobby pin. Use blue for the left pigtail and red for the right., This will give you a messier look. Only backcomb from the middle part of the pigtails and down., Be sure to focus on the ends of your hair where the hair chalk is. This will help further seal in the color and prevent it from coming off."

When applied to gray hair, henna will give your hair a natural reddish shade with a few hints of orange., You'll need to mix henna into a paste to use. The paste is made with henna and warm water. Henna comes in packs and the number of packs you'll need to use depends on your hair type. Shoulder length hair only requires a single pack. If your hair goes down to your mid-back, go for two packs. If your hair goes down to your waist, go for 3 packs.Use a quart size bowl and pour in your pack or packs of henna. Henna stains surfaces easily, so make sure to wear old clothing and cover the surface you're working on.Add hot tap water of approximately 120 °F (48.9 °C). Add water in small amounts while mixing the henna. There is no precise amount of water to use. Just use enough that the henna mixture forms a paste.

, You'll want to make sure your hair is clean before adding henna. This assures that no dirt or debris will get trapped in the mixture. Wash your hair as normal before applying henna., After you've washed your hair, towel dry it. There is no need to dry your hair completely with a blow dryer before applying henna. In fact, as henna dries out hair itself, it's a good idea to apply henna to damp hair., You'll need to section your hair, which means dividing it into roughly equal sections and securing them with clips. You'll apply the paste to one section at a time.How many sections you need depends on your hair length. With shorter hair, you may be able to get by with only two sections. Longer hair may need four or five sections.


Remember, henna can stain. It's a good idea to use cheap clips you're not attached to when sectioning your hair. You could also use plastic hair clips, which can easily be washed later., Unclip one section and begin to work. You will apply the henna directly to your scalp one section at a time. For best results, put on a pair of plastic gloves and use these to apply henna.Scoop up some paste and work it into each section of hair. Go from root to tip.
Make sure each section is saturated in the henna mixture. When you're done with one section, re-clip that hair. Touch up around the roots with a bit of henna. Then, move on to the next section and repeat the process.

, You should leave the mixture in for one to two hours. One hour is usually sufficient, but color may deepen slightly if you leave the mixture in for two hours. Hair is unlikely to deepen further after two hours, so do not leave the henna in longer than this., After letting the henna set, rinse your hair. Do not use shampoo. Make sure you get all the mixture out of your hair, which may take awhile. Once done, blow dry your hair for 10 to 15 minutes. You should see a noticeable difference in color., You need to let the color set. If you shampoo prematurely, your color may fade. Do not shampoo your hair for at least 24 hours after applying the henna., Henna fades with time and eventually gray roots will develop. You'll need to color the roots and touch up the rest of your head. You'll need to make more henna paste. You should be able to get by with a quarter of a pack of henna.As with the first mixture, use hot tap water that's roughly 120 degrees. There is no exact amount. Simply add tap water until you form a thick paste with the henna powder.

, First, use gloved hands to apply a layer of henna directly to your roots. Work from the root of the grayed hair to the end of the gray section. Make sure to saturate the gray hair. You should have a bit of paste left over after touching up your roots., Let the mixture sit for an hour to let the color set. Then, rinse out your hair with water. Do not use shampoo. Make sure to get all the henna out of your head., From here, add a light covering of the henna powder to the rest of your hair. Once again, use gloves to work in the paste.

Make sure you are getting enough high quality protein. The daily recommended amount of protein for adult men and women is 6-6.5 ounces and 5-5.5 ounces, respectively.You should try for a variety of sources of complete protein. These are foods which contain all the essential amino acids, the protein building blocks. Here is a list of some foods that are complete proteins:Dairy products (eggs, cheese, milk, yogurt, etc.)
Quinoa, a high fiber food with high levels of iron, magnesium and manganese
Buckwheat, a grain that is high in vitamins and minerals
Hempseed, which contains high levels of magnesium, zinc, iron and calcium
Chia seeds, which contains high levels of omega-3 fatty acids
Soy products, including tofu, tempeh and natto
A combination of rice and beans. Rice is low in the amino acid lysine, which is important for healthy hair growth, whereas beans are high. In addition, beans have a low content of another amino acid, methionine, whereas rice is high. If you combine rice and beans, you have complete protein.

Wherever possible, try to get your minerals from your diet.


Food high in iron include:

Eggs
Red meat (go for grass-fed beef or buffalo-- these are higher in omega-3 fats as well)
Dark, leafy green vegetables
Beans and lentils
Liver


Foods high in zinc include:

Seafood and shellfish, oysters
Spinach
Pumpkin, squash, sunflower seeds

, Frequent shampooing can strip the natural oils from your scalp and hair.

Many professionals advise their clients not to shampoo daily, but instead recommend hair washing two to three times a week.Avoid shampoos that are loaded with chemicals as it's unclear whether these chemicals may be part of the problem causing hair loss in the first place. You may want to avoid using products with ingredients like sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), parabens and ammonium chloride, especially if you have thin, fragile or treated hair.

, Conditioners can weigh down the roots of the hair and damage the hair follicles. Use a conditioner once or twice a week and avoid using conditioner directly on the scalp.Try a conditioner with natural ingredients.

You can save time by shampooing at night. Your hair will dry while you sleep, and may look quite wild when you wake up, but you'll be able to take advantage of the added volume and texture that results from air-drying.;
, If you'd like sleeker, shinier curls, then you should blow-dry your hair before curling.


Even if you wash the night before, you can blow-dry before you sleep to give your locks an initial smoothing, and then curl in the morning.

, Because you are achieving curls by using heat in this method, you want to be sure to protect your hair. Over-heating your strands can cause them to become dry and frizzy, and can lead to split ends.


Thus, you should give your hair a good spritz with a heat protectant spray or rub a small amount of protectant cream throughout the length of your locks.

, Your choice of heating instrument will vary depending upon the texture of your hair and the look you are hoping to achieve.


If your hair is naturally fine and straight, then you should probably go with a smaller-barreled curling wand or iron (1/2-1 inch)., If your hair has more texture or has some natural wave, then you can use a curling wand or iron with a larger barrel (1-2 inches).

, Using a flat-iron can provide you with looser, less-refined curls. You'll get better results, though, if your hair already has a bit of natural bend to it and tends to hold curls well.


If you have naturally stick-straight hair, a flat-iron probably won't work well.

, You want to give your heating instrument sufficient time to get to an ideal temperature before you begin curling your hair. If it's not fully heated, your curls will be limp and fall out quickly.


In order to avoid damaging your hair, you should always use the lowest setting possible that will provide you with satisfactory results.

, You want to create multi-dimensional curls and add volume to your hair. If you divide your hair into sections and curl them individually, you'll be rewarded with bouncy layers of curls that more closely resemble those possessed by people with naturally curly hair.


Begin by taking the top two-thirds of your hair and pulling it into a high ponytail or bun on top of your head. Secure it with a hair-tie.
The bottom third of your hair should be hanging loose—you will start by curling this section.

, Your final look will vary dramatically depending upon the size of the sections you curl. If you want tight, bouncy curls, you should curl small sections of your hair at a time.


A good rule of thumb is to match the size of the section of hair with the size of the curling wand/iron barrel: for example, if you are using a 1-inch barrel, then wrap 1-inch sections of hair around it at a time.
For a carefree, bohemian look, curl wider sections of hair (2-3 inches), while using a wider curling wand/iron.

, Spend some time researching and experimenting with different products to find the one that works best for you. You may think that the higher the hold level indicated by the package, the better, but this isn't always the case.


If your hair is thin or fine, for example, a strong hold gel or hairspray can weigh your hair down and pull out your curls.

, Before you wrap individual sections of hair around your heating instrument, you should apply a holding product. Give the piece you are about to curl a quick squirt of hair spray, or apply a very small amount of gel or mousse.


This will work better than spraying your entire head before curling: doing that may result in an uneven distribution of product.

, As you wrap the sections of your hair around your heating instrument, consider leaving the ends of your hair out of the curling iron (or keep them away from the heating element of the curling wand). This can give you a more natural look.Try leaving about half an inch of hair uncurled at the ends.

, If you release your hair from the curling iron too soon, before it's had a chance to heat through, your curls will fall out quickly.


Gently touch your finger to the hair that's wrapped around the heating tool to see if it's warm before you release it. Remember, you are aiming for warm, not burning hot, hair.
You may want to consider using a curling wand glove to avoid burns. Use your ungloved hand to carefully test for temperature.

, Try to alternate the direction of your curls every two or three sections.Thus, if you begin by winding the hair clockwise around the curling iron, make sure to throw in a few that are wrapped counter-clockwise to break up the pattern.

, Once you release your hair from the curling tool, don't touch them or comb them until they have cooled completely. Doing so will pull out the curl.

, Once you've finished curling the bottom section, take down the ponytail/bun, divide it in half, and leave the lower half hanging loose to curl.


Place the top portion of your hair back into a ponytail or bun, and curl the middle section that you left loose.
You will finish by curling the top.

, After all of your curls have cooled completely, you will want to spread them out and gently loosen them. You can do this easily by carefully running your fingers through them.


Alternatively, you can try shaking your head upside down to create more natural movement.
Avoid using a comb or brush unless your curls came out too tight. A brush will loosen them out and give you softer waves as opposed to springy curls.

, If you're worried about your curls holding throughout the day, you can give them one last quick spritz of hair spray. Don't over-do it, though, or you may end up with crunchy curls, and there's nothing natural-looking about that.

Sleep with your hair in buns.",How to Make Your Hair Look Naturally Curly2," If your hair has a natural wave or a texture that takes to curl well, then you may be able to achieve natural-looking curls easily without needing to use any heat.


Begin by either air-drying or gently towel-drying until your hair is damp but not wet.
Evenly spritz your hair with a sea salt spray, beginning about an inch down from the roots and ending about half an inch from the ends of your hair.The sea salt spray will give your air added texture and help promote beachy waves. You can find these sprays at just about any store that sells hair products, or you can easily make your own at home.
Scrunch your hair or gently twist sections into the wave/curl pattern you like, and let it air dry completely.
In order to retain your curls, avoid combing or brushing your hair.

, While sea spray can give great results on many hair textures, if your hair is on the drier side, the salt can further dry out and damage your air.You can instead try using a more moisturizing cream which is designed to promote natural wave and curl and reduce frizziness.


Let your hair air dry until it is damp, and then rub a small amount of cream throughout your locks. Avoid placing too much product at the roots, which can weigh down your waves and make your hair look greasy.
Gently scrunch or twist your hair, and consider using a blow dryer with a diffuser attachment to help the curls set completely.

, This is a great way to save yourself precious time in the morning yet have fantastic looking hair all day. Begin by washing your hair at night and letting it dry almost completely.


Wait until your hair is almost dry but still slightly damp. It's important that your hair not be too wet, or the inner sections won't dry and thus won't curl.
Apply a small amount of gel or mousse throughout, divide it into sections and twist into buns, securing with hair ties (bobby-pins may be uncomfortable to sleep on).
If you want a very curly look, divide your hair into multiple sections and twist your hair into several small buns over your entire head. Be sure to alternate the directions in which you twist your hair.
If you want loose curls or waves, you can place all of your hair into just one or two buns.
In the morning, all you have to do is unwind your buns, shake your head, and/or gently finger-comb your curls. Add a spritz or two of hairspray or sea salt spray if you'd like."

",How to Set Hair," The size of your rollers will determine the size of your resulting curls. Larger rollers will create larger curls and waves, while smaller rollers will create tight, pin, spiral or bouncing curls.


Don't forget to consider the length and weight of your hair when choosing your rollers. Long and thick hair will naturally result in looser curls than short, fine hair.
The ideal type of rollers will also vary based on how you plan to set the curls. For example, Velcro rollers will be easier to set using a hair dryer, but if you plan to sleep in the rollers, you'll be more comfortable with sponge or bendy rollers.;
, Shampoo your hair thoroughly and rinse. Use conditioner if that's part of your general hair-care routine. Rinse completely and gently towel dry.


If you want to use leave-in conditioner, now is the time to apply it.
Comb through wet hair so there are no tangles.

, Apply a styling product so your hair will better hold the curls once they are set. Remember, where there is more product, there is generally more hold. Choose from mousse, gel, hairspray or even thermal-activating setting spray. You can customize your curls by spraying just the ends of your hair for curls at the bottom, or spray the roots and underneath for voluminous waves.

, Part the hair into three sections, one on top and one on each side of your head, leaving the back hair loose. Placing curlers in one of these sections at a time will provide much additional ease to the process.


Pin sections down with long hair clips.

, There are no set times when to dampen the hair, just spritz it when you feel it is too dry to work with.

, You will use larger rollers for the top sections, then gradually move down in size as you get toward the bottom of the head.


Split each of the three sections into smaller sections about the width of your roller and no more than 2 inches thick. You will ultimately roll the sections in the direction you want the hair to fall.Secure the hair between two fingers. Now, smooth the ends of the hair around the roller, holding them down until the roll is started. Continue rolling until you get to the scalp.Repeat with the next roller section, duplicating what you did with the first.
Keep in mind what direction you want the curls to fall, toward or away from your face. Place the roller on whichever side you’ve chosen, and wrap from there.For most hairstyles, rollers on the top of the head will be rolled backward, away from the face.If you want curls that don't fall uniformly, roll the hair in various directions. If you roll some sections of hair forward and some sections of hair backward, your curls that look more natural.If you want small, tight curls, use the smaller rollers in your set. Use the medium-sized rollers for larger classic curls.

, For most hairstyles, the side rollers will be rolled in a downward direction.Move from the top of this side section to the bottom of it (at the ear area).
You will begin to use gradually smaller rollers at the bottom of this section of hair, ending with the smallest you use.
If you want an outward flip at the bottom of your hairstyle, roll the bottom curlers in an upward direction.Go to the other side section and roll as discussed above.

, Roll as described above from the top of each section of hair to the bottom.


Make sure you use smaller rollers as you near the neckline for all of these sections.

, Sit under a hair dryer for 30 minutes before checking to see if your hair is completely dry. Remove one roller first to be sure it is dry. If not, add 10 to 15 minutes with the hair dryer before removing the rollers.


If sleeping on your rollers, don't remove them until morning. Be sure and test one roller before removing the rest.

, Unwind each roller at a time when your hair is completely dry. Work slowly to avoid tangling your hair. You'll find it easiest to remove the bottom rollers first and work your way up to the top sections of hair.

, Once the rollers are out, brush out the curls to loosen them. Be careful not to over do it, since your curls should keep their shape for two or three strokes, but any more might cause them to fall out.


You can also use a pick or simply run your fingers through the curls to separate them and add some volume.

, Once you've reached the desired curls and volume, you can complete your hairstyle. For long, loose curls, you're already finished. But you can also tie back your curled hair or secure it in place with hair pins or barrettes, just as you would if it were straight.

, Once everything looks just as you desire, complete setting your style by spritzing it with hair spray. Choose a spray with your desired effect, whether it's light and natural or stiff and set in place.

Start with hair you haven't shampooed in a day or two.,
Add texture to your hair.,
Spray your hair with hairspray.,
Curl your hair.,
Pin your curls.,
Finish with more hairspray.",How to Get Your Hair to Hold Curls1," When you wash your hair, you rinse away the natural oils your scalp produces. These oils add texture and hold to your hair, much like a pomade or gel would do. Day-old hair is less likely to drop curls, since the natural oils in your hair will help the curls retain their shape.If it's too late, and you already washed your hair, you can still use this method. Just rough dry your hair with a blow dryer or let it completely air dry before you curl it.;
, There are several products you can use to add some texture to fine, straight hair so it keeps its curly shape longer than just an hour or two. Try smoothing one of the following products into your hair from the roots to the tips:


Dry shampoo. This is great to use if your hair looks a little oily at the roots. Sprinkle it around your roots, wait a minute, then comb it from the roots to the tips.
Curl-enhancing cream. Use a dime or quarter-sized amount (depending on the length of your hair) and comb in it from the roots to the tips to distribute the product evenly.
Gel or pomade. If you don't have curl-enhancing cream, hair gel or pomade will work. Don't use so much your hair gets weighed down; you want just enough to lightly coat your hair.

, Again, it's all about adding texture. Spray a light coating of light to medium hold hairspray a few inches from your hair, then comb it through from roots to tips to distribute it evenly.


Avoid using firm-hold hairspray, since it's designed to keep your hair locked in place. It could result in a stiff, crispy look.

, Now that your hair is prepped, use a curling iron, hot rollers or another curling device of your choice to add the curl you crave. Even if your hair is fine and straight, it should be able to hold any curly style if you prep it right. Here are a few fun styles to try:


Beachy waves
Spiral curls
Big, soft, sexy curls

, As you complete each curl, coil it against your head and use a bobby pin to pin it up. Repeat until all of your curls are pinned against your head. Let your hair fully cool down before removing the pins and letting your curls drop., Use a medium to firm-hold spray to keep your curls in place after you take them down. For a looser look, run your fingers through your hair before spraying; for tighter curls, spray away and avoid touching them.

Style your hair as desired.",How to Use Hair Rollers1," Small rollers create tight curls, and large rollers create softer, wavy curls. Very large rollers simply volumize your hair and cause the ends to curl under, rather than creating defined curls or waves. You need at least shoulder-length hair to use larger rollers. Hot rollers are good for almost all hair types except for very fine or thin hair that's prone to breakage. They're particularly good at reducing frizz.


The number of rollers you need will depend on the size of the curls you are trying to create, as well as your head size. If you’re trying to create a lot of small, tight curls with small to medium rollers, you may need a dozen or more rollers.
As a general rule, each roller should sit on a section of your hair about the same size as the roller, regardless of the texture or thickness of your hair.
Felt rollers offer additional smoothness and shine, which is great for hair that tends to frizz.You can create different curl or wave shapes by wrapping your hair around the curler multiple times. For example, making 1 ½ wraps around a curler will create a “c” shaped curl. 2 ½ wraps will produce an “s” shape. The number of wraps you can make will depend on the length of your hair and the size of the curler.;
, If you have extremely curly hair, blow dry your hair straight before rolling. This will help you set smooth, uniform curls.







, It's important to preheat your rollers to get them to the optimal temperature before you begin rolling. Follow the manufacturer's instructions. If you have a hot roller set with variable temperatures, you may need to experiment to find the right setting for your hair.


For tighter, spiral curls use small rollers and high temperatures. For softer, looser curls use large rollers and low temperatures., You can find heat-activated sprays and creams at most drug stores and beauty supply stores. This type of product will help protect your hair from heat damage and will keep the curl set longer. Distribute the product evenly throughout dry hair.








, Create a ""mohawk"" about 2 to 3 inches wide that runs from your forehead to the back of your neck. Secure it with a clip. Using a tail comb, part the hair on the sides of your head into a few even sections and secure them with clips.








, Comb through a section of hair as wide as the roller you're using and no more than two inches thick. Hold that section up and away from your head. Place the roller at the ends of your hair and roll down toward the scalp, rolling away from your face. Secure with clips.








Continue rolling the mohawk section, working your way from front to back. Section off manageable sections of hair and roll them onto the rollers, then secure with clips.

, Comb through the section, pull it up and away from your head, and place the roller diagonally across the ends. Roll tightly to your scalp and secure with clips.Repeat until all hair is rolled.









To achieve bigger lift, roll hair at the top part of the side sections diagonally. For the highest possible lift, roll the hair up at a 90° angle from each section.

, Allow the rollers to completely cool before removing them from your hair. Removing the rollers too quickly will result in less long-lasting curls. Rollers will take longer to cool in very thick or curly hair, but be patient. The results will be worth it!

, Start at the bottom and work your way to the top of your head. Hold the roller in one hand and remove clips with the other.









Do not pull or tug the roller out of your hair as it will mess up the curl and may also damage your hair. Allow it to drop out of the curl.

, Brushing through your curls will remove much of the curl and result in loose, flowing waves. To keep the curls neat and tight, run your fingers gently through your hair. Spray with hairspray to ensure long-lasting curls.









If you want more volume, bend over and let your head hang down. Shake your head a few times and run your fingers gently through the curls. This will give you bigger, bouncier hair.

, Spray your hair with a heat protectant. Comb it through thoroughly.








, Start with one side of your head. Gather up the top layers of your hair, leaving just the bottom layer, and pin them back with a butterfly clip. Comb out a one- or two-inch section (the smaller the section, the tighter your curls will be).







, Start about an inch or two from the roots.At this point, you will basically just rotate the iron, and move it down the length of your hair. The direction you rotate it and the speed you move it will depend on the kind of curl you want.








For tight curls, hold the iron vertically, and move down your hair slowly (not so slow that you burn your hair, of course).
For loose curls, hold the iron horizontally, and move down your hair more quickly.
For curls that turn away from your face, twist the iron up, toward the top of your head.
For curls that turn toward your face, twist the iron down, toward the ground.

, Use your finger to twirl your hair in the same direction as the curl. This will help set it in that shape.







, Work from the bottom to the top, and then do the other side of your head the same way. Mist it with hairspray to set it.

Finish with hairspray.",How to Get Your Hair to Hold Curls2," Conditioner makes hair smooth and silky, but when you're trying to hold curls, you want a rougher, dryer texture. If your hair is too slippery, it won't hold curl. When you wash your hair, rinse out the shampoo and skip the conditioner altogether., This product is actually made for people with curly hair, but it works great for straight-haired people who want to add curl, too. Use a dime or quarter-sized amount, depending on the length of your hair. Comb it through your hair from the roots to the tips to distribute the product evenly.


If you don't have curl cream, you can use gel or mousse instead. Don't add too much product to your hair, since you could end up weighing it down. Too much product will cause the curls to fall out instead of staying in place.

, There are many methods used to curl wet hair without using any type of heat. You can have shiny, glossy, well-shaped curls or waves without using a curling iron; you just need some extra time. Try one of these popular methods to get the look you want:


Create pin curls
Make sock bun curls
Curl hair with an old t-shirt

, No matter which curling method you use, the secret is to let your hair completely dry. You can help it along by blowing the pinned-up curls with a blow dryer. Alternatively, sleep on the curls and let them dry overnight.


Unpin one curl to test and see if they're dry. If the curl is still wet inside, pin it back up and wait few more hours, then try again.

, Remove the pins, t-shirt-strips or socks that helped you curl your hair, and let your curls down gently. Avoid combing or brushing them, since this can cause them to fall out right away., Use a medium or strong-hold spray to finish the look and hold your curls in place for the rest of the day. Remember to avoid touching your hair too much, since puling on the curls can make them fall out faster.

You need at least shoulder-length hair to use larger rollers. You should be able to you’re your hair around the roller at least 1 ½ times.Large rollers may not work well for people with very fine hair, as they can get too heavy and fall out. You may need to experiment to find what's right for your hair.

, Using a curl-enhancing styling product is especially important if you have fine or very straight hair. Otherwise, your curls may collapse after only a few hours. Use the amount recommended on the container and spread it evenly throughout towel-dried hair.








, Using a tail comb works well for this step. Divide sections so that you have one section running down the middle of your head to the back of your crown (imagine a ""mohawk""), one section over each ear, and one in the back. Secure each section with clips.









You can use basically any type of hair clip to hold your sections, but inexpensive sectioning clips like stylists use can usually be found in beauty supply stores or online. They make keeping your sections separate quick and easy.

, The width of the sections will be based on the size of the roller you're using: they should not be wider than your roller, and shouldn't be thicker than two inches or so..









Comb through each section before rolling. Use your tail comb to comb through your hair to eliminate any tangles and pull the section gently away from your scalp.

, Roll the hair in this section away from your face, toward the back of your head. Keep the hair taut as you roll by holding onto the ends with one hand as you roll with the other. After two complete rolls, tuck the loose ends in and finish rolling the curl.








If you want volume all the way along your curl, start rolling about an inch or so from the ends and roll the curl all the way down to your scalp. Secure with a clip.
If you want your hair to be straight near your head, start rolling about three inches from your head, and roll all the way to the ends. Then wind the roller down to your scalp. Secure with a clip., Divide each side section in half horizontally, using a tail comb to part the hair just above your ears. Roll the two parts of each side section under (rolling away from your face, toward the hairline at your neck) and secure with clips.









You may want to use larger curlers at the bottom and smaller curlers at the top for a varied look.

, Roll each part onto a foam roller, curling toward the back of your neck. Secure with clips.








, Blow dry until your hair is dry and warm to the touch. You need to get the hair warm enough to set the curl. Leave the rollers in for about 15 minutes, then gently remove them.









Don't brush your hair after removing the rollers! This will destroy the curls. If you need to, use your fingers to lightly separate your curls.
If you want more volume, bend over and let your head hang down. Shake your head a few times and run your fingers gentle through the curls. This will give you bigger, bouncier hair.

, Especially if you have naturally straight or very fine hair, using hairspray to further set your curls will help them keep their shape longer.









For long-lasting volume, flip your hair upside down before spraying.
You can also define individual curls further with hair wax. Just take a dab between your fingers and run them over the curls you want to define.

Dry your curls.",How to Use Hair Rollers3," You can use a variety of rollers for wet-setting hair. Mesh or velcro rollers are the easiest to roll, but may snag in thick or curly hair. Foam rollers are fairly easy to roll, but because they're spongy it may take longer for your curls to dry. Smooth magnetic clips will hold very tightly and produce well-defined curls, but are also the hardest to roll. Experiment until you find rollers that work for you and your hair.


Mesh and Velcro rollers should never be used in very wet hair. If you choose these types of rollers, you should air dry or blow dry your hair until it is slightly damp before using them.

, Because your hair will be drying under tension, it's helpful to use an extra-moisturizing shampoo and conditioner before wet-setting your hair. You can squeeze excess moisture from your hair in the shower, but don't towel-dry. Comb through wet hair.








, Part your hair at the left and right temples. You should have three sections: one over each ear and one at the top of your head. You can leave the back alone for now.

, Section your hair bit by bit, smooth gel or cream through it, and roll the curls away from your face. If you want very small tight curls, use small rollers and put them close together. If you want larger curls, use larger rollers.








, If you want to avoid heat on your hair, allow your curls to fully air-dry before removing the rollers. This may take several hours or even overnight.

Apply the setting solution and roll your hair up in perm rods.,
Leave the perm rods in for the specified amount of time and rinse well.,
Maintain the curls with the curl activator.",How to Get Jheri Curls1," You can find kits in most drugstores or beauty stores. Your kit should contain a softener to loosen your hair, a solution to set the curls, and perm rods (which may be sold separately). In addition to these materials, you'll need activator (aka Jheri juice, which keeps the curls looking moist and tight) and a shower cap.Making Jheri curls the classic way requires using chemicals that can cause permanent damage to your hair. If you apply the chemicals incorrectly, use too much, or overdo it in any way, your hair could become dry and brittle, and it might even break. This extreme hair damage is one reason why people stopped making Jheri curls the classic way in the mid-nineties. If you want the Jheri curl look without the harsh chemicals, skip down to the next section.
You might want to consider having your Jheri curls put in at a salon instead of doing them yourself. You're essentially giving yourself a perm, which requires some skill and knowledge of hair. Whether you have your hair done at a salon or do it yourself at home, you'll need regular touch ups.;
, Follow the instructions to apply the softener that came with your Jheri curl kit. Smooth it all over your hair and smooth out your hair as much as possible. Leave the softener in for the allotted amount of time. This will relax your natural curls and get your hair ready to be permed.








, Following the directions in your package, saturate your hair with setting solution, divide it into sections and roll it up in the perm rods. Make sure to divide the sections evenly and don’t put too much hair into the rods. Secure each rod and use more setting solution to begin the process of permanently curling your hair.









Perm rods come in lots of different sizes. Choose the size that you want your curls to be. Also consider the length of your hair and how long you want the curls to be when choosing perm rods.

, Don't leave them in too long; the setting solution contains damaging chemicals that can really harm your hair if you overdo it. When time is up, rinse the solution out of your hair for at least 10 minutes.








, Apply it to your hair and use your fingers to create defined curls. It's important to keep your hair moisturized all day long, since otherwise it will become very brittle and dry. Use the activator on your hair at night and wear a shower cap to keep your pillow from getting messy.

Wrap your front sections first if you’re using rollers.

, If you part your hair, roll the curls away from your part. Wind the curls in the back away from your face toward the crown of your head and the nape of your neck. Use an asymmetrical rolling pattern for a more natural look. Make tighter curls on top and bigger curls in the back for a more retro look.

, Use hair clips or bobby pins. Pin each curl immediately after making it with the curling iron. Leave all rollers in your hair until you’ve put them all in. Pin your curls as you release them from the rollers.

Enjoy your perm.",How to Do a Spiral Perm," Thoroughly wash your hair immediately before you intend to perm it. You need to clean off any oil and grime, but you also need to be somewhat gentle.


Do not scrub your scalp since doing so often causes your skin to produce more oil.
A deep cleansing shampoo might be a good idea during this stage since it will thoroughly strip away the oils in your hair without causing irritation at your scalp.
If your hair is already somewhat dry, though, avoid using any shampoo that contains alcohol or a similarly drying solution. The perming process already dries out hair severely enough, and drying it out any further could cause long lasting damage.;
, Gently squeeze out any excess oil or blog it away with a clean, dry towel.


You should only blot away the water. Do not ""scrub"" your head with the towel.
Do not use a hair dryer.
Your hair must remain wet if you want the spiral perm to work correctly.

, Use a wide-toothed comb to gently comb away any large knots or tangles in your wet hair.


A wide comb is better than a small one since small combs are more likely to cause breakages and damage, especially when used on wet hair.

, To prevent any chemicals from getting on your clothes, you should wrap a towel around your shoulders.


If you have a hairdressing smock, consider wearing that, as well, to further protect your clothes.
Consider protecting your face by applying a small amount of petroleum jelly to the top of your forehead, just below and around the front hairline. Make sure that you do not get any of the petroleum jelly on the hair itself.

, Clip most of your hair on top of your head, then use a comb to part away a section of hair at the nape (neckline) roughly 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) wide.The standard thickness is 1/2 inch (1.25 cm), but to be more precise, you simply need to part away a section of hair that can comfortably sit on the end of the roller.
Also note that the size of this section will change the size of your curl.
All other sections that come after this first one should be roughly the same size as this one.

, Fold the paper perm wrapper in half lengthwise and sandwich the end of the section in the bend.


Make sure that the paper perm wrapper extends all the way to the end of the hair section, fully covering the tips of your hair in the process. The wrapper can even extend a little past the tips of your hair. This can help ensure that the ends of your hair will be wrapped around the rod instead of bending improperly.
When the ends of a section bend improperly, you will usually see ""frizzies"" or ""fish hooks"" at the end of each curl.

, Hold one spiral perm rod directly under the end of the section and over the perm wrapper. Roll the rod under, moving toward your head, until the hair is fully around the rod once.


The rod should be a nearly perpendicular to your section of hair.
You should wrap this section of hair near one end of the rod.
Note that a spiral perm rod is typically a long, slender, flexible rod. Some newer types are more rigid, but already bent into a final spiral shape.

, Wrap the rod under the rest of that section of hair, allowing it to spiral up along the rod as you roll.


You need to wrap the hair on the rod at an angle. The top of the rod needs to tilt in toward your head, while the bottom, or starting end, needs to tilt slightly away.Gradually twist the hair and the rod as you wrap the curl. By the time you reach your head, the roller should rest against your scalp in a near vertical position.
Each turn around the rod should only partially overlap the turn before it.

, Once you roll the entire section and the rod is against the back of your head, bend the empty portion of the rod down so that the entire thing looks like a ""U"" or candy cane.


The hair at your scalp should be somewhat folded into the bend.

, Continue dividing your hair into 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) sections (or sections sized to match your first section). Cover the end of each section with a perm wrapper, then use a rod to wind the section into a curl.


Work from the bottom of your hairline up to the top. Working in this direction will give the rods a place to hang from the scalp.Wrap each divided section one at a time.
The sections you create do not need to be uniform. Oftentimes, the sections are divided into square segments, triangular segments, free-form segments, or a blend of two or more shapes. Dividing the hair in this matter helps prevent roller marks.
As you wrap various sections of your hair, you should notice that one section partially overlaps the previous layer.
If your hair begins to dry as you wrap it, spray it generously with water until it becomes damp again.

, If the perm solution is not pre-mixed, mix it according to the manufacturer's instructions inside a squeeze bottle with a pointed nozzle. Squeeze the solution over the wrapped hair of each rod.


Make sure that the hair on each rod is fully saturated with the perming solution.

, Place one or two plastic shower caps over the rolled hair. Allow your hair to sit under a low heat for the amount of time indicated by the perming solution manufacturer.


Usually, the processing time will be about 20 minutes.
Use as many plastic shower caps as needed to cover the hair without smashing the rods. Putting plastic over your hair will help hold the heat in.
A salon-style hair dryer that you can sit under is ideal for this practice, but if you do not have access to one, you can usually apply heat from a handheld hair dryer set to low. Keep the hair dryer an arm's length away from your head. If your arm gets tired, work in three-minute to five-minute intervals instead of keeping the heat on your head consistently.

, After processing your hair, rinse it thoroughly for five to eight minutes under lukewarm to warm water.


Do not remove the rods yet.
The idea is to get as much of the solution out as possible. You will not be able to rinse out all of the solution at this point, however.
Rinse the root of each section and gradually move all the way out to the end of the rod.
If the hair feels especially damp, allow it to dry under low heat for another five minutes before continuing.

, Prepare the neutralizer solution if it is not already pre-mixed, and place that solution into another squeeze bottle with a pointed nozzle. Squeeze the neutralizer over each rod, thoroughly saturating each section of hair from root to tip.


Read the manufacturer's instructions for the neutralizer. Some may need to be processed under low heat for five minutes or so. Others do not need to be processed.

, Carefully remove each rod from your hair, working in the complete opposite manner as before. Remove the rods slowly and gently to prevent any tangles.


Start at the top of your head and work down toward your neckline.
Unbend each rod, then gradually unwind the hair until the rod slips off.
Remove the perm wrapper from the end of each section once the rod is off.

, Thoroughly rinse the hair to remove any excess neutralizer and perming solution.


Do not use any shampoo as you rinse the hair.
If recommended by the manufacturer, you can also apply a leave-in conditioner. If this is not explicitly recommended, though, do not use any conditioner.

, This can take a few hours, depending on the length of your hair.


Do not use any heat.
Do not stretch the hair at all as it dries.
You may need to gently detangle your hair with a wide-toothed comb as it dries, especially once the hair is nearly dry and only a little damp.

, You should wait at least 48 hours before washing your hair with shampoo or conditioning your hair, unless otherwise instructed on your home perming kit.


If you wash your hair too soon, you could relax the waves and cause them to loosen or straighten out.

, Perms have a tendency to dry out your hair, even if you use a gentler formula. As a result, you should wash your hair with a gentle moisturizing shampoo and apply conditioner at least once a week.


Avoid any shampoo or other hair care product that contains alcohol.Alcohol is one of the most drying, damaging solutions you can apply to your hair, especially after perming it.

, After each washing, dry the hair gently to prevent the perm from relaxing.


If you do not have time to let your hair air dry, attach a diffuser to the end of your hair dryer and blow dry your hair on low heat. Doing this should prevent the curls from straightening out.

, At this point, your spiral perm is done and should last for many months.

Mess up the curls.",How to Get Bouncy Beach Curls1," Curling irons come in a variety of sizes, and the best size for you will depend on the type of beach waves you’re after, as well as the texture and length of your hair.


A large barreled iron, such as 1.5 inch, works well for long hair.This size is a good choice for loose curls that you wear the same day as curling; these curls may also last well into the next day, depending on how well your hair holds curl.Using a small curling iron, like one with a half-inch barrel, is a good tactic for straight, fine hair.You can also buy a specialty three-barrel curling iron, which will give you beach waves with virtually no effort.Expect that your curls will loosen. Use an iron that provides tighter curls than you hope to end up with.;
, Make sure your hair is free of tangles. These curls work well on unwashed hair, so don't worry about washing your hair. If you do wash your hair, make sure to let it air dry completely before starting.

, To add texture to your curls, spray the sea salt spray to the mid lengths and ends of your hair. Don't spray on the roots.Do not drench the hair; add enough for a good coating.


After you've applied the spray, scrunch your hair. Use your hands to scrunch chunks of your hair up toward your roots, like you’re making messy curls.
Allow the sea salt spray to air dry. Never use a curling iron on wet hair because it will burn your hair., Divide your hair into manageable sections, pinning the majority out of the way so that you can work with a few sections at a time.Sections of hair that are 1 to 2 inches are probably the best.


The amount of hair you have, as well as the size of the curling iron you use, will determine how many sections you need. The smaller the iron, the greater the number of sections needed.

, Working with one section at a time, hold the curling iron vertical and wrap your hair around the curling iron. Make sure the curling iron is pointed downward. Start by wrapping the beginning of the strand nearest your roots around the topmost part of the curling iron twice. Then, continue wrapping the hair down the curling iron shaft, leaving a little bit of space between each wrap.Open the curling iron and pull the iron upwards, letting the curl fall easily from around the shaft.


Hold the curling iron around the hair for at least 10 seconds. The longer you let the hair stay around the curling iron, the tighter the curl will be.If you are going for the messy look, don’t use the curling iron on the last inch or two of your hair., As you finish one section of hair, move on to another section. If your hair is extremely thick, you should curl it in layers. Start with the layers underneath first. Clip your hair on top of your head while you curl the lower sections. Each time you finish a layer, let down another layer and curl that layer until you have curled all of your hair., Flip your head over and shake out the curls. Finger-comb the curls and apply more sea salt spray for texture. Make sure to add hairspray to help the curls hold their shape.Try sleeping on your curls. If you’ve used a very small curling iron (e.g., a half inch barrel), you will want to sleep on the curls so that they have time to loosen up.In the morning, they will have lost some of their intensity and look more like natural, beachy waves. This will also give you a messier look.

You can also divide your hair into sections to see how many sections you can realistically create, count those sections, and you'll know how many tubes are needed.;
, You're not likely to want toilet paper to unfurl and stick to your hair.

Apply a heat protectant spray to damp hair to shield your locks from heat if you’ll be styling with a blow drier, curling wand or hot rollers.Freshly washed and dried hair is the main ingredient for lasting 80s-style curls.
If your hair is very damaged, tangled or textured, you may want to detangle your hair in the shower using conditioner and your fingers or a wide-tooth comb.;
, Comb all of the tangles out of your locks. Start at the bottom and work your way up in small sections. Hold your hair above the tangle as you comb to protect your roots from pulling.Try using a wide-tooth comb.

, Attach a diffuser to your blow drier for extra volume at the roots. Switch your hair dryer to a low speed. Run the diffuser through your locks as you dry your hair.If you plan to wear foam rollers or twists in your hair overnight, use the diffuser to completely dry your roots only. Or skip the blowdrying and tease your hair the next day when it’s dried naturally.

, Make sure the sections of hair you’re going to tease are dry. Use a fine-toothed teasing comb in one- to two-inch sections or smaller. Begin with your hair’s lower layer and work upwards. Hold up each section and backcomb towards your head. Move a little further up and repeat the backcombing. Spray each finished section with hairspray as you go.You’ll probably find it easier to clip up the top sections while you’re working on the bottom layer.
The smaller the sections you tease, the more volume you’ll achieve.
Teasing damp locks can be damaging to your hair.Make sure to shield your eyes when you’re using hairspray near your face.

, Choose Velcro rollers or a curling iron for the fastest but not as long-lasting curl. Use heated rollers for more longevity. Opt for foam rollers or twists overnight for the longest-lasting and most defined curls, and to avoid using extra heat on your tresses.The thinner the wand or roller, the tighter and springier the curls will be. The exception is foam rollers. Foam rollers can give you a variety of curl sizes, depending on how tight you wind your hair around them.
If you’re using a curling wand, opt for a tapered barrel, if possible. This will give you the 80s look of more volume in the body of your hair, with the curls tighter at the ends.

, If you’ll be using a curling iron, make a part in your hair with a comb where you want your hair part to be. Put a dollop of mousse on the top of your hair. Comb it completely through. Separate your hair into four sections, clipping up the top two., For rollers, start at the ends of your hair and roll the curlers away from your face, making sure your ends wrap around the roller.For a curling wand, start near your head, roll the curl towards your face, around the barrel of the wand.If you’re making twists, twist your hair away from your face.If you’re using a curling wand, hold the very end of each section while your hair is wrapped around the barrel. Keep your hair around the barrel until you can feel the heat coming through your hair.
Secure twists with pins or fabric elastic ties into four to eight mini buns on each side of your head.
Be careful not to touch your hand or face with a hot curling tool.

, Roll your bangs under with a large curler or curling wand for signature 80s bangs. Alternately, you can spit your bangs into two layers, curling one backwards and the other under.If you don’t have bangs, you can create the appearance of bangs for your 80s style hair! Take the front section of your hair where your bangs would be and pin it to the crown of your head so that your ends hang down like bangs.

, Keep your rollers in as long as possible, up to a couple of hours for long or thick hair. If you used a curling iron, pin each curl to your head in the shape of the curl you just made. Use the cool setting your hair drier until your locks are cool.Leave foam rollers or twists to set in your hair while you sleep.

, Remove any curlers or twists from your hair. Don’t brush your curls! Pull them apart a bit with your fingers and use a curling wand, if desired, for final touches. Smooth just a bit of hair oil with your fingers for glossier curls.You can use a comb near the front of your scalp to smooth down flyaways.

, Pull your hair up onto the top or side of your head – the higher, the better! Brush the sides only, leaving as much volume and/or bangs on top as possible. You can add extra teasing and hair product to the front once you’ve secured your ponytail., Use a teasing brush at the top front of your hair for an extra boost. Sweep all of your hair to one side of your head. Pin or clip your hair so that your curls hang down on just one side for the 80s sideways updo., Wear a big, floppy bow as a clip or on a headband. Alternately, pull up all or half of your hair into one or more funky fabric scrunchies. Leave your bangs loose for the ultimate 80s ‘do!

Choose an appropriate flat iron.,
Start with clean, dry hair.,
Section your hair.,
Clamp your hair.,
Curl the next section.,
Break apart your curls.",How to Get Bouncy Beach Curls2," Opt for a flat iron that is 1 or 1.5 inches wide. Any smaller and the curls may end up tighter than you’d like; if you go wider than 1.5 inches, it may be difficult to get any curls at all.


People with shorter haircuts will require smaller flat irons; larger irons won’t give enough of a curl.

, Make sure your hair is brushed and free of tangles. Add in some texturizing spray or volumizing mousse during this part of the process will help your hair to hold the curls and give it some lift.You may choose to use a heat protector spray since you will be applying heat with the flat iron. This will help to protect your hair from damage.

, Divide your hair into sections small enough to work with, about 1 inch each. Pin the rest of your hair out of the way.


You may find it’s easiest to start with the underside of your hair and work your way toward the crown of your head. To do this, clip your hair on the top of your head, leaving a layer of hair to curl.

, Start about an inch down from the root and place the iron in the hair. Don't clamp down just yet because this will create a crease. Rotate the iron and pull, then close the iron as you finish pulling the iron along the strand of hair. There's no need to twist the iron, just pull down along the section of hair.The flat iron should be vertical when making the curls, with the end towards the ceiling.Bend the iron away from your face as you curl.
Don’t go all the way to the ends of your hair; stopping a half or 3/4 of an inch before you get to the bottom will help you to achieve that messy, just-got-out-of-the-pool look.An alternate way to make a curl with a flat iron is to twist a small strand of hair around your finger until you get to your head. Remove from your finger and take that twist of hair and press it between the flat iron for about 10 seconds. Release for a curl., Continue curling 1 inch sections of hair by rotating the flat iron once and pulling along the strand. You may need to re-curl near the roots if the roots haven't taken to the curl as well as the rest of the hair.


Going in the opposite direction with the next section will keep your hair looking bouncy and ensure that large pieces of hair don’t clump together.Work slowly but smoothly. You want to put enough heat on the hair to get the “curl” into it, but not overheat the hair. Finer hair needs lower heat, while thicker hair needs higher heat.If you started curling in layers, let down a new layer each time you finish one layer until you have completed all of your hair.

, Once your whole head is done, break your curls apart with your fingers to give yourself that loose beachy look. Flip your head upside down and shake them out, comb through them with your fingers - anything you want.


Add some sea salt spray or texturizing spray to your hair to give it texture. You may also want to spray hair spray to help the curls keep their shape.
Don’t worry about messing things up—beachy waves aren’t supposed to look perfect!

If your hair is tangled, brush out the knots before you wash it.;
, Any tight hairstyle will curl your hair when left in overnight. Looser hairstyles involving thick sections of hair will lead to waves, while medium-sized, tight sections create curls. Here are a few options:










Braid your hair into two braids for waves, or four braids for curls. For tighter curls, braid the last half of the braid around a ribbon.

Make a bun on either side of your head, for light waves.
Make a ponytail at the top of your head. Place an elastic band around it, then a hair donut. Wrap thumb-sized sections of the ponytail around the donut until all of your hair forms a bun. Secure ends with hair clips.

, Cover the hairdo with a small amount of hairspray for more defined curls. Spray lightly to avoid damaging your hair.








, In the morning, take out your hairdo carefully and let your curls fall down. If the curls are rigid, shake them gently apart with your hands.









Apply more hairspray to keep them in place for a longer period of time.

For a more natural look, use your fingers to gently pull the braids apart, loosening them slightly.
For looser-looking waves, try using one single braid down the back rather than braiding two parts.
For tighter curls, separate your hair into three or four sections and braid each one. For thick hair, you may need to separate your hair into more than four sections.

, Wait several hours or go to bed with your hair in braids to allow the waves to set in., When your hair is dry or in the morning, remove the rubber bands and unbraid your hair. Gently run your fingers through your hair to create natural-looking waves."

Brush or comb the tips of your hair, then hold the brush an inch or so higher and brush down through your hair. Keep working your way up your head, brushing in downward motions, until you reach the top of your head.


Having knotted hair will make doing this hairstyle harder, and it will make your curls less defined.
If you encounter a knot, don’t yank your brush or comb through it. Instead, gently brush the knot in short, soft motions until it is untangled.;
, Headband curls are the most effective on slightly damp hair because your hair will dry into the shape of the curls. If your hair is dry, dampen your hair by holding your hair under the faucet for a few seconds. You can also spray your hair with a spray bottle of water. If you are trying this hairstyle after a shower, wait until your hair is mostly dry.









Don’t soak your hair; aim to make it damp as opposed to wet., Adding curling cream or mousse to your hair makes it slightly damper and also gives it more texture. This texture allows the curl pattern to hold better and last longer. If you already have thick, textured hair then you may not need to add product. If you have smooth, somewhat slippery hair, adding product can improve the look of your curls.








To apply product, place about a dime-sized amount in your palm and work it through your hair, starting at the ends and applying it up through your hair.

, Once you have dampened your hair and applied product, it’s time to put on the headband and start making the curls. Take an elastic hairband and place it “hippy style” on your head, wearing the headband over your hair like a crown so that the band runs diagonally over your forehead.








Use a comfortable headband as opposed to one that it too tight. Since you’ll be wearing this for an hour at least and possibly all night, the last thing you want is a headache from an overly-tight headband!
Try to use an elastic headband that is around the width of two fingers.

, Once you have put on the headband, it’s time to start looping your hair! Begin by taking a small strand of hair that is framing your face, either from the left or right hand side of your face. The strand should about the width of two fingers. Lift the strand up so that it is pulled over the headband, then loop the strand under the headband to make one complete loop.







, Once you create the first loop over and under the headband, take another small piece of hair right next to the one you just looped and combine the two strands into one.







, Once you have combined the strands, use the section of hair to make another loop over and under the headband next to the first loop.







, Keep adding and looping to the section of hair you are using until you get near the back of your head, behind your ear.







, Repeat the process of looping your hair, this time starting on the opposite side and working back to create loops. Stop when you reach the back of your head.








Your hair should now be rolled around the headband on both sides of your head, with a small portion of hair hanging down in the back.

, Take the entire section of hair that is hanging down at the back of your head and loop it under the headband as you did with the other hair. Because there is no other hair to combine it with, simply keep looping the hair around the headband until your reach the tips of the hair, then tuck the tips under the headband.







, If you are going to sleep with your headband curls, it’s a good idea to put a couple pins in place to secure your hair. Place a few bobby pins or hair clips to pin the loops to the part of your hair above the crown of loops.








, Once you have added clips, give your hair a quick spritz all over with hairspray. Using hairspray will help your hair hold the curl pattern once you take it down.







, Once you spray your hair with hairspray, most of your work to create this hairstyle is complete! Wait anywhere from one hour to overnight to take down your curls. The longer your wait, the tighter the curls will be, and the longer the staying power they will have., Whenever you are ready to complete the hairstyle, slowly begin to take the pins from your hair, unloop the strands of hair from the headband and pull the headband away. Your hair should be curly and voluminous!







, Once you remove the headband, it may take a little bit more work to get your hair exactly as your want it. Shake out your hair and use your hands fluff it up a little bit and let it fall naturally. If you feel like you want more relaxed curls, rake your fingers through your hair to loosen them. Keep your hair down, clip part of it up, or style it as you please!








When you are satisfied with your hair, give your head another spritz of hairspray and enjoy your beautiful curls!

Decide what width you need.,
Figure out which material makes sense for you.,
Consider what sort of design you want.,
Read some reviews.",How to Curl Your Hair with Tongs1," The type of curls you want will determine the curling tongs you use. For loose waves you will want to buy tongs one or two inches in diameter; for tight ringlets you will want one .75 to one inch wide.Because 1-inch tongs can be used to make either waves or ringlets, this might be a good size to use if you want more flexibility.;
, There are a few different materials from which the barrels of curling tons can be made.



Ceramic and tourmaline tongs are used by many professional stylists. The ceramic distributes heat evenly, and the tourmaline emits negative ions that help minimize frizz and damage to your hair.

Gold and titanium coated tongs are good conductors of heat, but do not help minimize frizz. Though the gold and titanium coating helps keep them from damaging hair as easily as chrome tongs do, it tends to wear of with time. Chrome tongs are the most widely available, and lowest quality curling tongs on the market. They tend to distribute heat unevenly, making it easy to accidentally burn or damage your hair, and they do not protect from frizz.

, There are a number of different variations on the curling tong.The most important factors in making this decision are your level of experience, and the amount of control you want.



Spring Curling Tongs are a good option if you are new to using curling tongs. They have a spring-action clip that holds your hair in place, making them very easy to use, and are available in a wide range of sizes.

Clipless Curling Tongs present more of a challenge, but give you more flexibility as far as the style of curls you can create. They do not create the crease that can sometimes result from using spring curling tongs, and allow you to get closer to the roots of your hair. They also reduce the danger of creating split ends.

Marcel Curling Tongs were designed for professionals, and will be very difficult for the novice to master. They have an extra handle that allows the user to exercise a greater level of control. You should not attempt to use these unless you feel very comfortable with both spring curling and clipless tongs.

Double and Triple Barrel Curling Tongs are excellent for creating waves, but are less flexible than other designs as far as the kinds of effects they can create.

Spiral or Ribbon Curling Tongs create spiraling ringlets, as their name suggests. Like double and triple barrel tongs, they work very well for creating a specific effect, but are not particularly adaptable to different styles.

, If you are feeling overwhelmed by the amount of information, consult the internet. There are many helpful guides that give detailed reviews of different tongs."

Make the strips as wide as you want your curls to be. For tiny curls, make them 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) wide; for bigger, looser curls, make them up to 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) wide.
If you don't have an old t-shirt, you can use long socks, dish towels, other items of clothing, and even paper bags. Just make sure the length of the strips is a couple of inches longer than your hair.

, Unpin each section of your hair and let the curls down. Continue until your hair is completely loose.Keep your sweet, vintage curls in place by scrunching them with a dollop of mousse and spraying your hair lightly with hairspray.

Wash and condition your hair.,
Apply product.,
Fret not if you do not have all the products suggested.",How to Curl Your Hair with Tongs2," There are different approaches to this for different hair types.


If your hair is damaged, oily, or limp, wash and condition it with something designed to create volume.
If your hair is thick or not particularly oily, do not wash it before curling. Simply apply a dry shampoo to your roots.
If your hair usually has trouble holding a curl, skip washing it for a day or two before curling. This should help make your hair more malleable. Using less conditioner, or none at all, may also help.

, Again, this will be different for different hair types.


If your hair is damaged, oily, or limp, spray it with a heat protectant from root to ends while it is still damp. Apply a strong-hold mousse liberally—you can do this at the roots to achieve a fuller look, or from mid-shaft to ends for a looser one. Blow dry upside-down until your hair is totally dry.If your hair is thick or not particularly oily, spray it from roots to ends with heat protectant, and work a liberal amount of strong-hold mousse through your whole head., You may not be able to afford lots of specialized hair products, especially if you don't curl your hair often, or you may be curling your hair on short notice and not have time to run out to the store. These recommended products will help your hair keep its curl and protect it from heat damage, but you can still achieve a beautiful curl without them. That said, it is highly recommended that at a minimum you have hair spray, and something to help protect your hair from heat (especially if you plan on curling it regularly). There are many shampoos that help with the latter, in addition to all the heat protectant sprays on the market.

Start with the top layer of hair on the back of your head.,
Apply the tongs to your hair.,
Hold for 10 to 20 seconds.,
Unwind your hair from the tongs gently.,
See how it looks.",How to Curl Your Hair with Tongs3," If your hair is fine or damaged, select a heat setting under 200 degrees. If your hair is curly or thick, select a heat setting between 300 and 400 degrees. As you go, you can gauge how well your initial temperature selection is working, and make adjustments accordingly. Never go above 400 degrees., Separate a section about 1 or two inches wide, and 1 to 1.5 centimeters deep.Comb it out and mist it lightly with hairspray, going from root to end. Hold the section of hair by the tip, keeping it taught.

, There are a few different ways to do this.


If you are using spring curling tongs and want to achieve a bouncy curl, clip the tongs close to the roots and slide them gently down to the tip, holding them horizontally. Roll up until the whole hair segment is wrapped around the barrel.
If you are using spring curling tongs and want loose waves, clip the tongs an inch or two above the ends of your hair, holding them in a vertical position, and roll up. Varying the direction in which you curl will help to create a more natural look.If you are using clipless tongs, start at the roots of your hair. Hold the tongs vertically, and wrap your hair around them in a spiral from base to tip., The amount of time you need will vary depending on how thick your hair is, and how much definition you want in your curls. If you are unsure, start at 10 and see how it looks. You can always go back and hold for longer, but you can’t un-burn your hair.

, Use a bobby pin to clip the curl onto your head. This will keep it out of your way, and help it hold its shape once you unpin it. Repeat this process until all of your hair is curled, then carefully unpin your hair.

, If your curls look a little too perfect, fingercomb your hair gently to break up any unwanted ringlets. If you want a slightly mussed look, flip your hair forward and then back. You may need to do this a couple times if you have thick hair, or if you applied a little too much product."

Gather your materials.,
Allow your hair to dry.,
Moisturize and use setting products if necessary.,
Detangle your hair.,
Section your hair.",How to Curl Your Hair with Straws1," Before you start your straw set, make sure you have everything you need. Both methods will require the same items: drinking straws, bobby pins, scissors, and a water spray bottle. You will also need a wide tooth comb and a few hair clips for sectioning.


Cut the bendable top off of each straw you plan to use. If your straws are already straight throughout with no articulated ends, you can use them as-is. When using straight straws, scissors are no longer required.
If your hair takes a long time to dry, you will also need a silk headscarf to sleep in.;
, Your hair doesn't need to be clean when styling it, but if you do wash beforehand you will need to let your hair dry first. Avoid using a blow dryer to prevent heat damage.


This hair roller method can prevent hair from drying completely. If your hair type retains moisture and you are styling ringlet curls, try to get your hair as dry as possible before you style.This isn't as important for the poofy look, however, since you will be removing the straws before your hair dries completely.If you have natural textured hair, drying it completely before styling isn't necessary. You can start your straw set while your hair is damp or wet if you choose., Apply a leave-in conditioner, wrapping lotion, and castor oil to your hair. This step is important if you have type 4 hair that tends to dry out. Your curls will come out much bouncier and last longer.


Skip this step if you don't have Afro-textured hair.

, Run a wide tooth comb through your hair to work out any tangles. Tangles will ruin the sleek look of ringlet curls but will not detract from the messy 1980s style. However, incorporating tangled hair into either method can result in knots that are even harder to remove.

, Splitting up your hair into smaller sections will make it easier to work with. Comb your hair out and away from your scalp and clip each section in place. Leave the first section you plan on styling loose.


How many parts you will section your hair into will be determined by hair length and thickness as well as the amount you feel comfortable working with at a time. Three sections are generally enough for hair rolling.

Start with clean and dry hair.,
Use a thin flat iron.,
Apply heat protectant.,
Part your hair into sections.,
Alternate flicks and curls.,
Make more pronounced curls by turning the straightener a full turn, instead of a half.,
Experiment with turning your straightener under and over.,

If your hair doesn’t curl easily or doesn’t hold a curl, put hairspray on sections immediately before you curl them.,
Grab the section of hair you want to curl.,
Use one of the above techniques.,
Finish up.",How to Curl Your Hair with a Straightener," Make sure to start with completely clean and dry hair. Wet hair won't curl at all and damp hair won't curl as well. Even if you have one of those magical wet-to-dry hair straighteners, it’s best if you have dry hair. Dirty hair also won’t hold its shape very well, so make sure you’ve washed it in the past 24 hours.









If you're blow drying your hair first, use mousse. The extra volume will keep your hair from looking too flat as you curl it.
;
, Your straightener should be about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) in width from plate to handle and have rounded edges, otherwise it won’t form smooth curls. A flat, paddle-style iron also won't do curls. It’ll be much harder to hold and wrap if you have this kind of straightener and the hair won’t want to stay in the right place.









Make sure you’ve got a good quality flat iron. The best work faster, make your hair smoother, and do less damage than poor quality irons. They can have a big impact on things like shine and the consistency of curls.Heat the iron up to the minimum temperature you need for your hair. If your hair is fine and thin, stick to the low end of the dial at below 300 degrees. Normal hair can be ironed at 300 to 380. You can turn it up to 350 to 400 if your hair tends to be thick, coarse, or frizzy., Applying a heat protectant or a thermal spray creates a protective barrier between the hair and the iron so that the hair doesn't ""frizzle"" and burn. Spray all over your hair – no need to comb, as it should mist on and dry quickly.









If you have thick hair, spray it on each section before you tackle it. If you just spray it on the top of all your hair, it won’t hit the bottom layers.

Also be sure to comb out any tangles in your hair before applying heat.

, You'll have better luck curling your hair if you section it instead of trying to attack the whole mess at once. In general, the thicker your hair the more sections you’ll need to do. Tie up the hair above your ears and put it in a bun on the top of your head. It needs to be out of the way.









Start at the bottom of your scalp, close to your ears and neck. Leave down as much hair as you can work with for your first ""layer"" of curls. A good rule is to work with 1 to 2 inch sections at a time. Pin up the rest.
Once that layer is done, you'll unclip your hair and let down another layer. Again, clip up what you can't curl right now. Keep curling in layers.

, Flicks and curls are simply two slightly different ways to curl your hair with a flat iron. Try both to see what you like.










Flicks: Start half-way down the length of hair, clamp the iron closed and turn it back on itself in a half turn. You should now have created a U-shape with the hair and the iron. Keeping the iron on that half-turn angle, slowly move it down the hair shaft to the end of the hair. The faster you move the iron, the less pronounced the curl/flick will be. If you like big soft flicks, slow down your iron.

Curls: Starting fairly close to the scalp (but not close enough to accidentally burn it), clamp the iron closed and turn it back on itself a half turn (the same as with flicks). Run the iron slowly down the hair shaft to the end. Again, the slower you move the iron, the tighter the curl. The faster you move the iron, the gentler the wave.


, With flicks and curls, you just rotated the hair straightener a half turn. If you want more ringlet-y, complete curls, rotate the straightener a full turn, turning the hair over onto itself, sort of creating a loop.









Find out what your hair tends to do between the half and the whole turn. You may find that half is enough, or that a three-quarters turn is more ideal for you. What's more, certain days may be half-turn days, and other days will feel like full-turn days. It's up to you!

, When you rotate your flat iron, whether it’s a half-rotation or a full-rotation, you’re confronted with a decision to make: to turn under and around or over and around. Neither is incorrect, though the curl will reverse with the change in angle. Which looks best on you?









Try to be consistent. It's easy to curl one way on one side and then when you switch arms to inadvertently switch directions, too. If you do wind up accidentally doing this, you'll probably be the only one who notices your curls in are different directions.
On the other hand, alternating directions can also look great. You just have to be sure to use a consistent pattern throughout.

, Once in a while, it feels high time to bring back 1995. Clamp your flat iron down on your hair and turn it up a quarter of a turn. Then, clamp it on the next bit of hair and turn it down a quarter of a turn. This technique will give you flat waves, almost like a finger wave. Repeat this process down the length of your hair.









For these flat waves, you're clamping down on every bit of your hair. For curling, you simply curl at the top and slowly drag it down – kind of like curling ribbon on a gift or balloon.

, If you want your curls to hold their shape just how they immediately fall from the straightener, spritz a tiny bit of hairspray on the hair right before you curl it.









Be sure to use a non-aerosol working spray for this. Aerosols will create a sticky mess.
Don’t use too much hairspray, as well. Then it becomes stiff and crunchy, which is not the look you’re aiming for.

, How much hair you include in each curl is up to you, but here are a few points to keep in mind:









Smaller sections make smaller, tighter curls, as well as more of them. If you want a look that's closer to ringlets, keep your sections less than two inches wide.
Larger sections result in bouncier, looser curls that look a little more natural. Use sections that are wider than two inches for big curls.
Mix it up. You don't have to stick completely to one size or another. For instance, you could do larger curls close to your face and the top of your head to create lift and volume, and tighter, more delicate curls underneath for support. Try it a few different ways and see what you like best.

, The above methods share the same basic principles: turn your hair straightener over itself, and lightly and slowly drag it down your hair. Clamp lightly keeping the hair on the straightener plates – not so hard it's difficult to move and not so lightly that the hair escapes.









The variables you can switch up? Where you start on your hair (towards your scalp or towards the ends), how slowly you move the flat iron, and how much you rotate the flat iron. Experiment with these three variables to find the perfect look for you.
You don't have to curl all your hair, either. A few strands that are straighter or just wavy can give you a natural, beach-y look.

, You can leave your hair as-is when you're finished curling, or you can add an additional touch to wrap up the style you want.









For looser curls: Gently run your fingers through your hair and tousle it. You'll get a little more volume, and a relaxed, natural look.
For more hold: Put a light mist of hairspray all over your curls to keep them sleek and tight throughout the day. If you live in a really humid area, consider using an anti-humidity spray as well.

Select and moisten a strand of your hair to start.,
Roll your hair tightly onto a straw.,
Secure the straw in place with a bobby pin.,
Wrap the next strand around a new straw.,
Leave the straws in your hair until it is completely dry.,
Carefully remove the straws.,
Style your hair as desired.",How to Curl Your Hair with Straws2," With your fingers, separate out a small section of hair that will be your first curl. Moisten it slightly with the water spray bottle.


It doesn't matter where you begin, but going from your left to right (or vice versa) will make missing strands less likely.
Remember that the thicker the strand, the bulkier each curl will be. Use a lot of hair per roller if you want only a few curls.For thin coils, use sections that are roughly an inch wide. These will be separated into smaller pieces later on., Start with the bottom tip of your hair and wrap it around near one end of the first straw. Roll the straw up your hair until the entire strand is coiled or you run out of space on your straw. Be sure to keep the strand taut on the straw without pulling your hair to the point of discomfort.


For the tightest ringlets, roll your hair flat onto the straw.If you are going for a thinner spiral or wavy look, coil the strand around the straw like a telephone wire. Instead of flattening your hair against the straw, keep the section rounded., Take a bobby pin and clip the straw-wrapped hair strand near its roots. Slide the bobby pin across the center of the straw and through the hair you're securing it to. Later on, you may start to run out of space and may need to clip to a different wrapped strand instead., Secure each new finished strand with a bobby pin. Work your way around your head until all of your hair has been wrapped. Keep the sections at a consistent size and coil pattern.


While this method works with many different ringlet sizes and styles, you want each strand to be as similar as possible. Multiple curl types may be used by an experienced stylist when creating more adventurous hairdos, but it is a difficult look to pull off.

, Depending on your hair type, this may take anywhere from three hours to overnight.


When drying overnight, wrap your hair with a silk scarf or a bathing cap.
If you remove the straws while your hair is still damp, your hair will look more similar to a messy 1980s-style perm. While this is another great look, it's very different from the ringlets you were probably going for. Don't waste all the time you spent rolling and waiting by rushing at the end., Free each curl one at a time. Start by unclipping its bobby pin. Next, simply unwrap your hair by rolling the straw in the opposite direction. Depending on your hair type, just unclipping the bobby pin may cause the strand to unwrap itself., After removing the straws, your hair is likely to be a single layer of a relatively few strands. To add depth and fullness to your hair, use your fingers to carefully separate each large coil into multiple smaller ones.


Keep in mind that the hair texture you begin with will impact your hair's final look. However, it's not always possible to predict how this style will come out in your hair until you try it.
If your hair is naturally straight and doesn't tend to hold shape well, a little hairspray will help your curls to last longer. You must also be careful to avoid brushing out your new curls as you style."

The smaller the sections, the more volume your hairdo will have.
Keep in mind that this method works best for long, straighter hair that lacks natural volume.

, Starting from the tip, loop your hair around the straw multiple times until you reach your roots. Keep these loops loose and irregular. However, don't wrap them so loosely that the curl comes undone., Use a bobby pin to hold the straw and your hair in place along your scalp. Spritz a little hairspray onto each wrapped strand. This will help hold your curls in place once you've finished.

, Unlike ringlet curls, you don't have to make every strand the same size or wrap them the same way.


Because of the chaotic, messy nature of this look, it's ok if you miss a few strands and stray hairs.

, Wait about two to three hours first to allow the curls to set. Unclip the bobby pins and then unravel the strands by hand. Use your fingers to gently fluff out your coils into ""big hair."" Add a small amount of hair oil to soften your hair to make it easier to work with.Keep in mind that this method intentionally adds tangles and frizz to create volume. Combing it will be difficult.

Take the clean towel, then gently pat from the roots to the tips of your hair. Your hair should not be dripping with water. It should be slightly wet to the touch.


If your hair is too wet, then the curls may be weighed down by the moisture in your hair. Your hair should be wet enough to style.;
, Most people recommend that you take smaller pieces for better curls, although the process may take longer. The smaller the section of hair, the tighter your curls will be. If you section a bigger amount of hair, the curls will be loose and big.

, Take the first section of hair, wrap it around the pencil, then spin the pencil 180 degrees to ensure that the hair will not slip off the pencil. Continue to twist on the rest of the hair onto the pencil. Leave about one to two inches of hair on top to allow the curls to contour your head.

, The longer you leave your hair twisted on the pencil, the better your curls will be. If you'd like to move on to the next section, take a stretchy hair-tie or clip, and wrap the band around the twist and pencil. Move on to the next section of hair with another pencil. You may also choose to pin the pencils to your hair and sleep with them overnight. This will allow for the most natural curl.

, Your hair should be dry to the touch. Start with the first sections that you twisted on the pencil. The later twists will need more time to curl. If you feel that the curl is too tight, use your fingers to gently run through the curls until desired length and style.

Prepare your hair.,

Begin curling.,
Depending on how short your hair is, you may want to use a thinner curling iron.,
Leave the ends straight.,
Hold the hair wrapped around the wand for 5 to 10 seconds.,
Finish the bottom layer, then move onto the top.,
Add the finishing touches.",How to Curl Short Hair1," Before you begin curling with a curling iron, your hair should be clean and dry. It should also be fairly straight. If you have wavy hair or hair with a lot of cowlicks, you may want to consider straightening it with a flat iron before proceeding.









At this point, adding a very small amount of styling gel or wax may help to set your style, however, you should never apply hairspray before curling, as this will only damage the hair.
Also make sure to spritz your hair with a heat protection spray before proceeding.;
, Use a comb to separate your hair into a top layer and a bottom layer. Take a couple of large salon clips and pin the top section of your hair to the top of your head, allowing you to work with the bottom layer alone.









Leave your bangs alone. You can leave them hanging down or clip them to the top of your head. Either way, do not include them in the curling process.
If your hair is particularly thick, you may need to split it into three sections for best results.

, Starting at the front, take a small section of hair and wrap it around the curling iron, holding the iron away from your face so that it remains a safe distance away from your skin.









The curl should be rolled away from your face, rather than towards it, with the curling iron to the back of your head.
The wider the section of hair you use, the bigger the curl will be. For shorter hair, a 1 to 2 inch (2.5 to 5 cm) section should suffice. This will produce medium sized curls.

, Larger curling irons may be too big to wrap short sections of hair around, and won't produce good results. A curling iron with a 1 inch (2.5 cm) diameter should work well.

, With shorter hair, it may be best to leave the ends straight rather than curling the entire strand of hair. This will leave you with a bit of length and will prevent the curls from sticking out from your head.


If using a curling iron with a clamp, clamp down on the separated section of hair about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) away from the bottom before rolling upwards.
If using a wand, start wrapping hair around the iron from the top, but stop about 1/2 an inch away from the ends of the hair.

, Depending on how tight you want your curls to be, you can hold the hair wrapped around the wand for varying lengths of time.









For loose waves, hold the iron in place for only 5 seconds, then release the curl. For tighter ringlets, hold the curl for ten seconds or more.
One you have released the curl, spritz it lightly with hairspray. This will help it to hold its shape. However, if you made the curler tighter than you'd like, leave it relax for a couple of minutes before spraying.

, If you want a more natural look, avoid separating the hair into even sections. Instead, vary the size of the sections and alternate between curling the hair towards and away from the face.









Gradually let down and curl the top layer. Remove hair from the top layer pinned to your head one section at a time. Curl each section in the same manner used to curl the bottom layer of hair before pulling down the next section.

, Once you have curled you entire head of hair, gently pull the curls apart with your fingers to prevent the ringlet look. Touch up any curls that may have fallen out.










Tease the roots. Add volume to your style by grabbing the crown area of your hair, just near the part, and backcombing the roots.Add a final spray of hairspray. One good, final spritz will help hold the finished look in place.

If you do not have time to wash your hair or if you have recently washed and dried it, then you can also spray water onto your hair to make it damp.;
, While your hair is still wet, apply some leave-in conditioner and work it through your hair with your fingertips. Then, use a brush or comb to get rid of any tangles. When you are finished, your hair should be tangle-free.








Make sure that you apply the leave-in conditioner while your hair is still damp. Do not put it on after you hair has dried., To ensure that your curls will stay put after you take out your twists in the morning, work a dollop of gel through your strands. You can use your brush or comb to work the gel through your hair or just use your fingers.








You can also use mousse in place of hair gel. Mousse contains alcohol, so it will dry out your hair a bit and this will help to hold the curls for longer., Use your comb or your fingers to divide your hair into two sections. Then brush these sections to opposite sides of your head. Next, take one of the sections and brush it up towards the top of your head.








It is important to position the twists on top of your head because putting them on the sides or back of your head might make sleeping uncomfortable.
You can use hair clips to secure your hair in high pigtails until you are ready to twist them or just do one pigtail at a time.
If you have lots of hair or if your hair is thick, then you might find it easier to separate it into more than two sections., Take the hair and then start to twist it all in one direction. Keep twisting the hair until it begins to coil up into a bun. When you have twisted all of the hair and it is all coiled up into a bun, then secure your hair with a hair tie.








Repeat the same process on the other side.

, Your spiral curls will not be ready until your hair has dried completely. You will have to leave the buns in your hair at least overnight. If your hair is really thick, then it might even take a little longer for them to dry.








To check the dryness of your hair, remove one of the hair ties and unfurl the twist part way. Then feel the hair in the center of the twist to see if it is dry.
When your hair is completely dry, you can remove the hair ties.

, As you unfurl the twists, gently pull apart the big spiral curls. Instead of having one big spiral curl, you will have many smaller spirals.Go slowly to ensure the best results.









You can divide the big curls so that the spirals are all about the same size or create different sized spirals.
Do not use a brush or comb. If you brush or comb through the spirals, then they will lose their form and become frizzy.

, If your hair does not hold a curl for long, then adding a texturizing spray may help. To set your curls, try spraying on some texturizing spray. Hair spray may weigh down your hair and cause some of the spirals to loosen. Texturizing spray will help the curls to maintain their form and bounce.








Make sure that the texturizing spray gets onto all of the spirals. You may even want to flip your hair upside down to reach the ones underneath.

Apply hairspray to the curls.",How to Curl Your Hair with a Sock Bun," To create the donut to make the bun, you’ll need a clean sock. It’s important to choose one that has tight elastic at the top so it will really hold your hair in place.








You may want to use a child size sock to ensure that the donut will be tight enough to hold your hair.
If you plan to wear the sock bun outside, choose a sock that’s similar in color to your hair. That helps camouflage the sock if any of it peeks out amidst your hair.;
, Once you’ve chosen your sock, take a pair of scissors and cut off the toe of the sock to essentially create a long tube. Next, flip the sock inside out to get ready to turn it into a donut.








You’ll have an easier time cutting the sock if you use a pair of scissors or shears designed for cutting fabric.

, After you’ve cut the sock and turned it inside out, begin rolling it up over itself to form a donut. Make sure to roll it from the toe to the elastic, and continue rolling until all of the fabric is contained in the ring.







, When you’re ready to create the sock bun, smooth your hair with a comb or brush to remove any tangles. Next, pull your hair up into a fairly high ponytail. Secure it with an elastic.








Your hair can be dry or damp when you pull it up into the ponytail. If it’s freshly washed, there’s no need to bother drying it completely.
If your hair is prone to frizz, don’t use a brush to remove tangles. A wide-tooth comb is a better option because it won’t create frizz.

, If your hair isn’t freshly washed, you’ll want to dampen the length of the ponytail before forming the bun. Spritz your hair with water from a spray bottle so it’s just lightly damp.








You don’t necessarily have to use water. You can dampen your hair with leave-in conditioner or spray gel if you prefer.
Be careful not to get your hair too wet. It may not all dry by the next morning if you soak it.

, Once your ponytail is lightly dampened, take the end of it and pull it through the hole in the center of the sock donut. Slide it down just 2- to 3-inches (5- to 8-cm) toward the base of the pony.








Don’t slide the sock donut all the way to the base of your ponytail yet. There should just be a small amount of your hair through the end of the donut.

, After you’ve pulled the end of the ponytail through the donut, take those ends of hair and divide them into three or four sections. Next, tuck the ends of the hair underneath the bottom of the sock to secure them.








If you plan to go out with the sock bun, you don’t have to worry about it looking perfect right now. You can fix it once it’s secured.

, With the ends of the ponytail stuck under the bottom of the sock, begin rolling the donut toward the base of the ponytail. Continue rolling it all the way to the scalp, and secure the sock around the base of your pony.








As you roll the sock toward your scalp, you’re actually rolling your hair over the sock at the same time. That’s what helps make the bun appear large and thick even if you have fine hair.
Once the sock bun is secured, you can play with the placement of the hair around the bun to help make it neater and ensure that the sock is completely covered.

, The sock should be tight enough to hold the bun in place on your head. However, if you have very thick, coarse hair or the sock isn’t very tight, stick some bobby pins into the bun to help hold it in place.







, Once the sock bun is secure, you can go to sleep with it in and let it sit overnight to curl your hair. You can also do the sock bun in the morning, wear it all day, and take it out in the evening when you’re ready to go out.While you don’t necessarily need to leave the sock bun in overnight to curl your hair, you want to make sure that the hair inside the bun is completely dry before removing it.

, When you wake up the next morning, slowly unroll the sock from your hair to remove the bun. Be careful not to pull on your hair too hard or you may wind up pulling out some of the curls.







, After you’ve removed the sock, carefully pull out the elastic securing the ponytail so all of your hair is loose. Shake your head a little to loosen the curls and help them fall more naturally.








Don’t brush through your curls or you may wind up pulling them out. Use your fingers to comb through your hair if there are any tangles.

, While the curls will last most of the day on their own, you may want to give them a little help. Lightly spray your hair with lightweight, flexible hold hairspray to help keep your curls in place throughout the day.








If curls usually fall out of your hair easily, substitute a texturizing spray for the hairspray. The hairspray may be too heavy for your hair and weigh the curls down so they fall out.

Apply a heat-protecting spray to each section as you curl.,
Go for a flat curl.,
Give yourself beach waves.,
Try a spiral curl.,
Finger comb all curl styles and set them with hairspray.",How to Curl Thick Hair With a Curling Iron," Your hair doesn’t have to be freshly washed,but it must be clean, moisturized, and completely dry before you begin. If your hair is dirty, oily, or has styling products in it, give it a wash with a mild shampoo. Condition with your favorite conditioner, rinse, and let your hair air dry completely.For healthier thick hair that will be easier to curl, look for anti-frizz shampooing and conditioning products that contain avocado or jojoba oil, aloe, honey, and other moisturizing ingredients. These ingredients (plus the anti-frizz) will make your thick hair softer and more manageable, which will make it easier to work with.
It can be very easy to use too much shampoo when you have thick hair, but this can strip your hair of natural oils. Instead of using more shampoo, use the recommended amount and dilute it with water to help work it through your hair.;
, The type of curling iron you use is important on two counts: the material and the barrel size. Irons made from certain materials will be better than others for thick hair, while the barrel size will help you achieve different curl styles.


Ceramic and titanium curling irons are preferred by most professionals because they evenly apply a great deal of heat in a short amount of time, meaning they can penetrate thick hair better than other curling iron materials.For loose curls and waves, choose a curling iron with a thicker barrel, somewhere between one and two inches (2.5 and 5 cm). For tighter and smaller curls and ringlets, opt for a smaller barrel, like one around three-quarter inches (1.9 cm)., To prevent heat damage, you should always use a high-quality curling iron with an adjustable temperature gauge. For thick hair, start around 200 to 300 F (93 to 149 C) and see how your hair responds to the curls. If your hair is healthy and needs a bit more heat, increase the temperature, but never exceed 400 F (204 C)., Comb your hair with a wide-toothed comb or plastic-tipped brush. Use the tops of your ears as a reference to divide your hair into an upper and lower section. If your hair is extremely thick, divide it into three or four sections. Clip up the sections of hair separately, leaving the bottom section loose and down.Once you curl all the hair in the bottom section, you can let down the other sections of hair one at a time and begin working on them.

, Even thick hair is prone to heat damage, so it’s important to protect it. Regardless of what type of curl you want to achieve, divide your hair into smaller sections that are about an inch (2.5 cm) wide before you curl each section.Working with small and thin sections will reduce the amount of time you need to apply heat, and help curl thick hair more easily.

Before you curl each section, apply a heat-protecting and setting spray or mist that will both protect your hair from heat damage and help it hold the curls.Hold the bottle at least six inches away from your hair to prevent it from soaking your hair. Comb the spray through before curling., Now that your hair has been prepared, you can use a number of different techniques to achieve different types of curls. One such curl is the flat curl, which will result in a full and voluminous curl.

Starting at the top near the root, begin wrapping the hair around the barrel, always keeping a hold on the tip of the section. Be sure to keep your hair smooth as you wrap, and don’t twist it.Making the curl near the root, rather than the tip, will help thick hair hold a curl longer.
Close the blade, and while still holding the tip of the section, pull the iron away from your head as you rotate the barrel so that the hair feeds through again. Do this for five to ten seconds, then release the blade and let your hair out.Instead of letting the curl fall immediately, cup it with your hand and let it cool for a few seconds. This will prevent the curl from dropping, stretching, and losing its shape.

, Beach waves are a loose and wavy curl style that’s modelled after hair that’s been exposed to fresh, salty air all day. To achieve this look, wrap your first section of hair flat around the vertical barrel the same way you did for the flat curl. Close the blade and let it sit for five to 10 seconds.

For the next section of hair, repeat these steps, but instead orient the curling iron horizontally. Continue alternating between a vertical and horizontal barrel for each new section., Take your section of hair and gently twist it until you’ve twisted the full length of the section. Wrap the twisted section around the vertical curling iron barrel. Release the blade and hold it there for a few seconds, and then put two fingers on top of the hair. When the hair starts to feel hot, gently let your hair out without destroying the curl. Cup the curl in place until it cools.Because your hair is twisted in the iron for this curl, the amount of time it takes to heat the curl will depend on how thick your hair is, which is why you should go by how it feels rather than a set time.

, Regardless of the curl style you've chosen, you should finger comb and spray your curls once they've cooled. Finger combing will loosen the curls and make them look more relaxed and natural, and the hairspray will set them for a long-lasting style.

Simply run your fingers through the curl once or twice, then apply a light layer of hairspray to help set the curl for the day.If you don’t have hairspray or don’t want to use it, you can clip or pin the tip of each curl to your head instead of letting it fall as you go. This will help the curls to set and stay. When you're finished curling all the sections, release them in the same order in which you curled them, combing through each curl with your fingers."

Take the top section near the crown of your head first, and leave the hair at the nape of your neck and sides of your head for later.It’s best to use a natural bristle brush when you’re brushing your hair because it will reduce the amount of static and frizz.
It may help to use clips or hair elastics to section off your hair, so you don’t get confused about what you’re working with.
You can divide your hair into more sections if you prefer. The smaller the sections of hair that you use, the tighter your curls will be.;
, When you’re using socks or rags to curl your hair, it’s best not to start with completely wet hair because your locks can become frizzier that way. Instead, just dampen the sections of hair as necessary. Use a spray bottle filled with water to mist the section of hair that you’re working with, so it will hold the curl more easily.








Instead of using plain water to dampen your hair, you may prefer to dampen with a texturizing or curl enhancing spray to help give your curls more texture.

, When your section of hair is damp, take a clean sock or strip of fabric and roll your hair around it, starting approximately 1-inch from the end. Continue rolling the hair and sock all the way up to the crown of your head. At the top, tie the sock or rag into a knot to secure it in place.








Make sure to keep the hair as neat as possible as you roll it toward the top of your head, so you don’t wind up with any kinks or bends in your hair when you’re done.
You shouldn’t tie the knots too tightly when you’re securing the hair in place or you may have trouble removing the socks or rags later.
If you’re using rags to curl your hair, you should cut strips of fabric that are approximately 2-inches wide and 8- to 10-inches in length., Take another clean sock or rag, and repeat the process on your next section of hair. Continue all around your head until all of your hair has been curled and secured in place.








It can take anywhere from four to eight socks to curl all of your hair. If you’re using rags, you’ll probably need between 10 and 20 strips of fabric for your whole head.

, In order for the curls in your hair to take hold, you have to allow the socks or rags to stay in place for a while. It’s best to sleep on with the fabric in your hair, so you’ll usually get the nicest looking curls if you leave them in place overnight.If you don’t have time to wait overnight for curls, leave the socks or rags in place for at least four to five hours. Keep them in as long as you can for the best results.

, When you wake up the next morning, untie the socks or rags in your hair and remove them. Use your fingers to gently comb through the curls to loosen them as desired.








If you use a brush on your curls, you’ll wind up removing most of them and creating a wavy look instead.
You may also want to add an anti-frizz product to your hair too. Use your fingers to smooth it through your hair so you don’t disrupt the curls.

, Now that you’ve got some beautiful curls, you want to make sure that they last as long as possible. Spritz them with a flexible hold hairspray to help lock them in place without making your hair feel too crunchy.If you don’t like the feel of hairspray, you don’t have to use it. Just be aware that your curls may start to fall by the end of the day.

Make your way through each part of your hair, pulling from the roots to the tips of your hair.Use a wide-toothed comb for curly hair and a fine-toothed comb for straight hair.

, As you are twisting around the pencil, bring your section of hair closer to one end of the pencil to bunch the hair together. Make sure that you cannot see the pencil under your hair, but do not overlap the hair over each twist. This allows for a more natural looking curl that continues from the top to bottom. It will also help you to flat-iron your hair, not the pencil.

, Make sure that your iron is not too hot as it can burn your hair. For fine and chemically treated hair, use a low heat setting below 200 degrees. For thicker or coarse hair, set it to 200-300 degrees. Never go above 400 degrees.Wait about 3-5 seconds for each twist, gently pressing the hair on the pencil. Be careful not to press your fingers with the hot iron. After ironing, hold the twist for about 10 seconds. For extra hold, spritz hairspray when holding the coiled hair. , If you feel that they are too tight (almost spring-like), run your fingers through your curls once or twice. Do not continue to comb through your hair as the curls will not stay. After you have achieved the look you want, continue on to seal in your style.

Then apply a rinse-out conditioner for softer curls. Rinse it out with cool water. If you want firmer, more rigid curls, you can skip the conditioner altogether.
Remove excess moisture but do not dry completely. Gently pat your hair with a towel so that it is no longer dripping wet. Your hair must be moderately damp in order for pin curls to set properly, however.

, Mousse makes the hair rigid enough to hold a style. A gel or cream could also work, depending on your hair type.









Fine hair works best with a mousse.
Medium and thick hair work better with a gel, which has more holding power.

, For this style, neat, orderly sections may work better than uneven sections. The sections of hair should be about 1/4 to 1 inch (2/3 to 1 1/4 cm) wide. The wider the section is, the softer and looser the curl will be.









Place your finger at the ends of a section of hair. Wrap the hair around your finger, rolling the curl under and away from your face. The curl should be just loose enough to slide off your finger.
Use bobby pins or a small, smooth salon clip to secure the curl to your head. Slide the pin or clip diagonally over the top of the curl.

, After you have wrapped and pinned your entire head of hair to your scalp, use a spray bottle to spritz water over your hair. Spraying the hair with water ensures that it dries evenly.


Instead of using water, you could use a curl spray to dampen your pinned hair. This will aid the curling process.

, Keep the pins in for several hours to overnight to allow them to dry. If you're planning on sleeping with the curls in, place a plastic shower cap over your hair to prevent frizz.









If you're in a hurry, you may use a hair dryer to speed up the drying process. However, be aware that your curls will not be as tight if you use this method.

, Once your hair is dry, remove the pins or clips and gently unwind the curl. Run your fingers through the curls to separate them so that they are not as tightly wound.

Set the curls.",How to Curl Short Hair3," Before using a flat iron, your hair should be completely dry, as applying intense heat to wet or even damp hair could cause damage.


Day old hair will hold curls better than freshly washed hair, especially if your hair is very fine. If your hair feels a little greasy, apply some dry shampoo to the roots before you begin.
Always apply a heat protection spray to your hair before using a flat iron, otherwise hair will become dry and frazzled. Ask your stylist to recommend a good one for your hair.

, For shorter hair, a thin flat iron will work best, as you will be able to wrap the hair around it more times than you would a wider one, thus producing more curl.









If you only have a wide flat iron, it will still work, but your hair will be wavy rather than curly.
Also set your flat iron to the lowest heat setting necessary for curl. Fine hair will curl with a temperature of around 320 °F (160 °C), whereas thicker hair may need a temperature around the 420 mark.

, It will be easiest to curl your hair when it is separated into sections. Grab all of the hair above your ears and clip it securely on top of your head.








, Grab a small strand of hair from the bottom section. It should be about 1/2 to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 cm) in width. Clamp the flat iron at the root of the hair, then give it a half turn, so that the hair forms a U-shape in the iron.









Keeping the flat iron in the same position, pull it slowly through the hair. The slower you do it, the tighter the curls will be. Pulling the flat ion quickly through the hair will give you loose waves.
Move onto the next strand of hair. For uniform curls, keep turning the flat iron in the same direction each time. For messier curls, alternate between turning the flat iron upwards and downwards.

, Once you have completed the bottom section of hair, you can let down the top section and curl using the same method.









When you're curling the front bits, make sure to turn the flat iron away from your face, so the curls don't keep falling in front of your eyes.
Rather than curling bangs, simply grab the end of the hair, clamp the flat iron about halfway down and simply flick the hair away from your face.

, Once you have completed each curl, define its shape and position with your fingers, before it has completely cooled down. Then spritz it with some hairspray. By the time the curl is completely cool, it should be set and in place.









If the curls are a little too ringlet-y for your liking, leave them to relax while you curl the rest of your hair and give your hair an overall spray once your done.
A light-medium hold hairspray is best if you want loose, relaxed waves. Strong hold hairspray can leave your hair feeling crunchy and rigid."

While your hair is still damp, apply a flexible curling product like a gel or cream (if your hair is very straight) or an anti-frizz serum (if your hair tends to frizz).
You will have to leave your headband curls in overnight, so it's best to do this in the evening.

, A thinner headband will work best, about 1/2 inch to an inch in width. Place it around your head -- going over the hair at the back of your head rather than underneath it. At the front, the band should be about halfway down your forehead.








, Starting at the very front, take a small strand of hair and tuck it underneath the headband, twisting slightly as you go.









Grab a second strand of hair, join it with the first, then tuck it underneath the headband in the same manner. Keep working your way around your head wrapping uniform sections of hair around the headband.
The tighter you wrap the hair, the tighter the curls will be, and vice versa.

, Once you have wrapped all the hair around the headband on both sides, you will be left with a single strand of hair at the very back. Twist this until it curls upwards towards the scalp, then secure with a bobby pin.









For a little more volume at the front, push the headband upwards towards your hairline. This will create volume and prevent you from getting a red line across your forehead!

, Now all you need to do is go to sleep with your hair secured in the headband. If you're concerned about frizz, try sleeping with a plastic shower cap over your head.








, In the morning, remove the bobby pin securing the hair at the back, then gently pull the headband out of your hair.

Wash your hair as you normally would, and then towel dry it slightly so it’s not dripping. If you don’t want to wash your hair, use a spray bottle with water to get your locks fairly damp before you start the curling process.If your hair doesn’t hold curls well, you may want to spray a texturizing spray on your wet hair before moving on. That added texture in your hair can help it curl more easily.

, Braids and buns are quick, easy hairstyles, but the way that they twist your hair also means that they can add curls and waves to your locks. For looser waves, pull your hair back into a single braid or tie it up in a single bun. However, if you want tighter, more defined curls, divide your hair into sections and create several braids or buns all over your head..









You can curl your hair with traditional, French, or fishtail braids. Use whatever style is your favorite or the easiest for you to do.
If you want the simplest style to create curls, divide your hair into two sections on either side of your head. Create one bun on each side and secure them in place with elastics for a Princess Leia-inspired look. You’ll get loose, natural curls all over your hair without much effort.
If you want an even easier way to create some curls or waves in your hair, gather it up as you would for a ponytail, twist it tightly, and use a shark clip to pin it to the back of your head. You’ll get looser, less defined curls, but your hair will still have some texture when it dries.

, In order for the curls to take hold, your hair must dry completely. That’s why you may prefer to braid your hair or put it in buns at night, so you can leave them in place overnight to ensure that they’re totally dry.You don’t necessarily have to start the process at night. Because braids and buns are hairstyles that you would wear out of the house, you can also go out while you’re waiting for your hair dry and curl.
If you need your curls in a hurry, you can help the drying process along by using a blowdryer on your hair.

, Once you’re sure that your hair has dried completely, being taking out the braids or buns. Your curls will be somewhat fragile, so don’t use a brush to help them in place. Instead, use your fingers to gently separate the curls and style them.

Curl enhancers come in a variety of formulas, but when you’re doing pin curls, it’s best to use a spray product.

, To make it easier to curl and pin your hair, it helps to divide it. Depending on how thick and long your hair is, you may just want to separate it into two sections, one on either side of your head. If you have a lot of hair, though, you may find it easier to work with three or more sections








Use hair elastics or clips to separate each section. That way, the other sections won’t get in your way when you start to curl.

, To start your first curl, take a piece of hair from the top of the section you’re working with. Keep in mind that the size of the section you take will determine what your final curls look like. A small section, approximately 1-inch or so, will result in tight curls. If you use larger sections, you’ll wind up with looser curls.When you take hold of the section you’re going to curl, brush it out to ensure that it’s smooth, and spray it with some more of your curl enhancing product.

, Starting approximately 1-inch from the end of the section, begin rolling the hair back on itself to create a loop. It helps to use your finger to twist the hair back over to hold the curl shape in place as you work. Roll the section of hair all the way back toward your head, placing it flat against the scalp.








Make sure to tuck the end of the hair into the loop to ensure that it’s curled as well.

, With the section of looped hair pressed to your scalp, use a bobby pin to secure the curl in place. Depending on how thick your hair is, you may need another bobby pin to keep the hair in place.








Be sure to have plenty of bobby pins on hand. You don’t want to have to go hunting for pins when you’re trying to hold a curl in place.

, Once your first curl is pinned, you can move onto the rest of your hair. Complete the process for the first section of hair that you’re working with, and then move on to the next section until your entire head is done. Make sure that you curl every piece of hair, so there are no random straight pieces when you’re done.








Be sure to do the top of each section first. It’s more difficult to do the lower pieces if the top layer is in the way.

, When all of your hair is pinned, it’s time to ensure that your curls will last all day once you take them done. Use a firm hold hairspray to mist your entire head. Ensure that you apply the spray evenly to every pinned curl so they’ll all stay in place.








Don’t hold the hairspray too close to your hair when you’re spraying or your hair may wind up feeling really hard and crunchy. Hold the bottle approximately 8-inches from your head while you’re spritzing.

, To ensure that you get the best curls possible, you need to leave the pins in for at least several hours. Three or four hours can often be enough, but you’ll get the best results if you leave the curls in place overnight. Because they’re pinned flat against your head, pin curls are usually comfortable to sleep with.If you want to go out while you’re waiting for your curls to set or keep the curls undisturbed while you sleep, fold a large scarf or bandana into a triangle and wrap it over your hair.

, When you think your curls have had time to properly set, being removing the pins and uncurling your hair. They’ll be fairly tight when you first unroll them, so use your fingers to gently comb through and style them.








If your curls are too tight, use a brush instead of your fingers to work through your hair. That will help smooth them so they have more of a wavy appearance.

If your hair is too wet when you begin, the paper will soak up the water and will not hold your hair properly.For African American hair, start with dry hair. Spritz a little bit of water, oil, and a moisturizing product onto each section of hair. You can also put a bit of product into the palm of your hand, and massage it into each section of hair as you go.;
, Use a wide-tooth comb to make sure your hair is tangle-free before starting. Damp hair is vulnerable to damage and breakage, so it’s important to use a comb rather than a brush.Start at the ends of your hair and work your way up, getting out the tangles from each section before moving on.

, To simplify this technique, it’s best to section out your hair so you can work with one section at a time. Depending on how much hair you have, you may spit it into a bottom and top layer, or a bottom, middle, and top layer. Use hair clips to pin the top sections up. This will make the process much more manageable.

, If you’re using brown paper lunch bags, tear or cut strips down the length of the bag, cutting off the bottoms so that you have one, smooth strip.If you’re using larger paper bags, make sure to cut your strips so that they are all about 8-10 inches.

, For best results, use about 1-inch sections of hair. Place your damp hair, or your hair with product, in the middle of the paper strip and fold one side of the strip over, so that your hair is sandwiched between the two sides. Then, slide the strip down to the bottom of the section of hair, so that you’ll be able to roll up the entire strand., This part can be a little tricky to master. Basically, you want to begin rolling your hair around the middle of the paper strip, where the two sides have overlapped. Practice rolling the hair around the folded paper strip until if feels secure.For African American hair, you may prefer to create twists in your hair, and then roll the twist around the paper strip as outlined above. To create the twist, split the section of hair into two parts, and wrap them around each other. Then, roll that twisted section with the paper., Once your hair is securely around the paper strip, slowly begin rolling it up the section. There should be two loose ends of paper sticking out on either side of the roll. Continue rolling until you’ve gone as high as you’d like the curl to go.You can go all the way to your scalp if you want volume in the roots, or you may leave a few inches of straighter hair at the top of your head. That’s completely up to you!

, Once you’ve rolled as much hair as you want to curl, you need to secure the paper strip. Do this by tying the two loose ends together.Make sure you create a secure knot that will hold your hair firmly in place while it dries.


If you’re unable to form a knot with the two loose ends of paper, you may need to work with longer strips.

, Once you’ve finished the bottom section of hair, let down your top section. Repeat the same process until you’ve wrapped and tied every single piece of hair in a paper strip.When you’re finished, double check that all of your papers are securely knotted.


The more paper curls you create, the better you’ll be at this technique.

, You can create your paper bag curls before you go to sleep, and let them dry overnight. If you’re going to be lounging around the house, you can also certainly put your curlers in in the morning and let them dry throughout the day. The most important thing is that your hair is completely dry before removing the strips.If you’re in a rush, you can run a blow dryer over your curlers. Keep your blow dryer on low or medium heat, and make sure to apply a heat protectant to your hair if you plan to do this.

, Once you’ve felt your curls and determined your hair is completely dry, it’s time to untie your paper bags. Gently undo each knot and slowly unravel your rolled hair. Do this for your entire head. When you think you’ve untied them all, run your hands through your hair to ensure there isn’t any paper left in your hair.Keep a recycling bin near by so you can toss your paper strips into it as you remove them.

, Don’t brush your curls out, because you’ll undo the structure of each curl and create a frizzy mess. Instead, gently run your hands through your hair, playing with your curls until you’ve smoothed and tamed them to your satisfaction. If you like, you can spritz a little bit of hairspray on your curls to ensure they hold up for the entire day.Your curls may be tight when you first remove the paper bags, but over time they will loosen and fall into looser, softer curls.

Start with clean, dry hair.,
Apply a heat protecting serum.,
Heat up a curling iron.,
Wrap the front of your hair around the curling iron.,
Use the same method to curl the rest of your hair.,
Spray your hair with hairspray.,
Remove the pins.",How to Curl Long Thick Hair1," Curls tend to fall out of hair that's a little oily, so don't use too much conditioner before you plan to curl your hair. Don't curl wet hair, either; as your hair dries, the curls will fall out, especially if your hair is long and thick.;
, Using direct heat from the curling iron can damage your hair, so it's a good idea to apply serum before you get to work. Serum meant to protect your hair from heat damage is available in the hair styling section of drugstores.








, If you want big, loose curls, use an iron with a bigger barrel. For tighter curls, choose one that has a smaller barrel. Either way, try to use a ceramic curling iron. These get hotter than other curling irons, creating a longer-lasting style for thick, long hair.








, Start with the hair that grows above your forehead, and wrap a two-inch section of hair around the barrel. Roll it over so that the hair gets pulled back from your forehead, not toward your face. Hold it there for three seconds, then remove the curling iron and use a pin to hold the curl in place.


Don't hold the curling iron in your hair for too long. Too much heat exposure can cause your hair to dry out.
If you have bangs, don't wrap them with the rest of your hair. They should be styled separately.

, Wrap it in two-inch sections around the curling iron, hold in place for three seconds, then slip out the iron and pin the curl to your head.









If you need help curling the back, ask a friend to help you out. It can be difficult to make neat curls on the back of your head.
For a tousled look, experiment with curling sections of your hair in different directions, rather than uniformly curling them toward the crown of your head.

, When all of your hair is pinned up in curls, spray it with hairspray. If you want tight curls that stay in place all day, use a maximum hold spray; for looser, more natural-looking curls, use a loose hold spray.








, After your hair has cooled from the iron, remove each of the pins and let the curls drop to your shoulders. Apply more hair spray if you wish. You can also run your fingers gently through the curls to make them look softer.

Roll your hair in the strips.,
Let your hair dry.,
Take out the t-shirt strips.",How to Curl Long Thick Hair2," Don't over-condition, as this will make your curls more likely to fall out over the course of the day. While your hair is still wet, use a wide-toothed comb to remove any tangles. Gently pat it dry with a towel.

, Use a scissors to cut an old t-shirt lengthwise into strips. Insert the scissors at the neck and cut down to the hem, then repeat along the neckline until you have enough strips to roll up your entire head of hair. The strips should be a few inches longer than your hair.


If you don't have an old t-shirt, you can use long socks, dishtowels, or any piece of cotton fabric that is the same length as your hair.
If you want small, tight curls, make the strips narrow. For larger curls, make them wider, about 2 or 3 inches (5.1 or 7.6 cm).

, Start by separating a section of your hair from the rest. Comb it out so it's smooth, then line up the end of a t-shirt strip with the tip of the section of hair. Begin rolling it toward your so that the hair gets rolled up in the strip. When you reach your scalp, tie the ends of the strip to hold it in place. Repeat until all sections of your hair have been rolled.


Roll strips of hair in different directions, or under instead of over, to achieve a tousled effect.
Roll halfway up your hair and stop if you want waves that only extend halfway up your hair.

, Wait several hours or overnight for your hair to completely dry in the strips. Removing the strips before your hair is dry will result in curls that don't last very long.

, When your hair is totally dry, untie the strips and let your curls fall to your shoulders. Use hair spray, gel or mousse to hold them in place.

, Bend over and use a comb to gather your hair at the top of your head and secure it with an elastic band. Make sure it's free of bumps and tangles.








, Take a clean tube sock, cut off the toe, and roll it into a donut shape. The larger the donut, the bigger your curls will be. Place the sock donut over your ponytail and pull your hair through. With the donut placed against your head, wrap your hair over the donut and tuck it underneath, a section at a time. Continue doing so until all of your hair is securely in place over the donut.








, Wait several hours or overnight for your hair to dry around the bun. When you're sure it's completely dry, remove the bun and let your curls fall free. This method results in loose, wavy curls. Keep them in place with gel, mousse or hairspray.

",How to Curl Hair Without Hairspray," You want the oils to build up in your hair before you try to curl it.


If your scalp gets too oily, try putting some dry shampoo at your scalp but leaving the rest of your hair alone.;
, This will give you nice waves that you can build on with your curling iron. This works especially well if your hair is damp when you braid it. Simply rinse your hair (don't shampoo it), lightly dry it with a towel, and then place it in braids.









You can put your hair in as many braids as you like. Make sure that however many you do, that it will be comfortable to sleep on.
You can also roll your hair up into little buns to get a similar effect. Simply section off your damp hair into about four sections and twist them up into little buns, holding them up with bobby pins.When you take the buns out, your hair will be even curlier than if you braided it, but it will be more uncomfortable to sleep on.

, The last thing you want to do is fry your hair, so protect is as much as you can from the extreme heat produced by a curling iron. This will protect your strands from the damage a curling iron can do.








, This will help to maximize your curls, keeping them soft and not frizzy. Curl booster comes in a gel or spray form. Use whichever type you like.








, This will help your hair set once it has curled.

, You don't want to comb or brush your hair out totally if it has some curls from the braids you put in. However, you do want to make sure you can get individual pieces separated into sections to curl. You will want to be able to separate one inch sections all the way around your head with the tip of a comb.








, Curl each area individually, starting at the section closest to your face.








Take a one inch section and, holding your curling iron vertically, clamp onto the end of it.

Wash and dry your hair.,

You are basically going to make 5 twists.,

Make the top front one first.,

The twisting technique is rather like making a bun, except this is a very long, skinny one.,

You'll end up with a twisty, coil-like protrusion sticking out of the top of your head!
,

Now take out the back ponytail, divide your hair into two (vertically down the back of your head) and put one side into a bunch to keep it out of the way.
,

Divide the other side into two by drawing a line with your comb from your ear across your head horizontally to meet the vertical parting you've just made.,

Take out the bunch on the other side, divide and twist as in previous step.
,

Now you should have five funny-looking twists sticking out of your head.,

Leave for at least 6 hours or preferably overnight.
,

In the morning take out the twists one by one, starting with the lower ones.,

When all twists are out, bend over and give it another careful comb (not too much).,

, One at the top front (centrally)and then two on each side, one above the other., Divide the hair with a central parting. Then section off from the parting down to the ear on each side. Put those two sections together to make one front section. Tie back the rest of your hair into a rear ponytail - it will make it easier to create your first twist., Keep twisting your hair over and over very tightly until it eventually bends on itself. Then, continue twisting and winding the section of hair around itself, back towards your head.

If it’s layered, you will have to work a little bit more to tuck them in.





;
, Flip your head over. Gather your hair, and put it into a high ponytail, as high up as it will go. Secure it with a “scrunchy” (this kind of ponytail tie prevents kinks) hair tie. 







, Only spray until it’s lightly damp. You don’t want it too wet; otherwise it may not be completely dry by morning. After you’ve done it a few times, you’ll know the perfect amount of dampness for your own hair.








If your hair tends to be on the frizzy side, add a little anti-frizz serum to your spray bottle. You may also need to first blow dry it smooth.

, Pull the sock straight up to the end of the ponytail. Then slide it back down a little bit. For the hairs that are sticking out, spread them around the top of the sock. After doing that, they should go up and over. You want them to tuck neatly under the bottom of it.







, Keep your ponytail straight up while you’re rolling so the hair stays taut. Continue rolling until you’ve reached the base of your ponytail.

Lightly spray hairspray to give your curls hold.",How to Curl Hair with a Curling Iron1," Turn on the curling iron and heat it to 320 degrees for fine hair and 430 degrees for thicker hair. Experiment to find the right temperature for you. It's best to go with the lowest temperature that does the job. This is going to damage your hair less.;
, Make sure there are no tangles or your curls won’t form properly. Your hair should be completely dry before you curl it. Blow dry any damp sections.








, This product is usually sprayed onto dry hair. The heat protectant will form a buffer between your locks and the iron to add shine and prevent damage at high temperatures.

, Sections should be about 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) wide and there should be about three-four sections from the bottom to the crown of your head. Separate the sections using clips so that the only hair hanging has either been curled already or is the next section of hair that is going to be curled.

, Using just the wand (and not the clamp at the bottom of the wand that ""holds"" the hair as it curls), wrap your section of hair around the barrel. Be sure not to overlap your hair, as this will reduce heat and result in limp sections. Use your fingers to hold the edge of the section of hair close to the barrel without burning your hair. Doing this rather than using the clamp will prevent crimps in the curls.









Be sure to alternate the curling direction between clockwise and counterclockwise for a more natural effect.

, Grabbing the bottom of the curl, compact the curl to create a perfect curl. Use a bobby pin or a similar hair clip to fasten the circle of hair to your head.

, then wait until the curls are no longer hot before you take off the clips.

, Shake out the curls and fix any curls that are messed up

, These strips can be from 1 to 5 inches (2.5 to 12.7 cm) wide and from 8 to 18 inches (20.3 to 45.7 cm) long, depending on the type of curls desired. A 1"" x 12"" rag will generally make a tighter curl than a 5"" x 18"" rag. It's advisable to make a variety of sizes so you don't get frustrated if your hair does not take the thin 1"" x 12"" rags.

Though, if it’s too damp, it won’t dry overnight and your hair won’t be as curly. It’s good to dry it until it’s barely damp underneath and at the roots., Athletic socks work well because they have good elastic and are tighter at the top, which is especially better for fine hair. If you use an old sock with stretched-out elastic, your curls will be looser. A tighter, smaller sock makes tighter curls. Roll each sock down towards the open toe. Keep rolling until each one is in a neat, smooth donut shape. 








Use two socks for a more evenly curled look. When you’re finished, you will have one rolled sock in front of the other.

, To avoid a ponytail dent, don’t wrap the elastic too many times around your hair. You want it loose enough so that you could wrap it one more time. Spritz a little hairspray before rolling. Brush through evenly.







, Begin rolling and tucking your hair down and around the sock. Pull the sides of your hair over to cover the whole donut. Keep tucking and rolling it until your hair is securely wrapped around it.

Run a wet comb through it, or dampen the section with a spray bottle.This method is for short to medium-length hair, layered or straight.

, The sock will be parallel to your head. Depending on the look you’re going for, you can either roll the hair up or roll the hair down around the sock. As you roll, smooth the ends so they fold well around it. Otherwise, you’ll end up with sharp, bend lines. Roll the sock all the way up, stopping just below the crown area. To secure it in place, tie the sock underneath in a knot.







, If you’re hair is fine to medium, you only need one sock for each side and one for the nape. If your hair is thick, you can section it off into smaller sections and use extra socks. Now go to sleep!.

Pin the curl.,
Repeat with the rest of your hair.,
Let the curls dry completely.,
Unpin the curls.,
Separate the curls.,
Style your hair.",How to Curl Hair with Bobby Pins1," It's best to start with hair that is damp, but not soaking wet. Shampoo and condition your hair as usual, then let it air dry or pat it gently with a towel so that it's damp and easy to work with. You can apply a bit of product to help the curls hold if your hair is fine and doesn't tend to hold curl.


If you'd rather start with dry hair, you can spray your hair with water after you set it in curls. Depending on your hair texture, this might result in either a fluffier or glossier curl. Experiment with both methods to find out what's best for your hair and the style you want.;
, It's easier to make sure your hair gets evenly curled by dividing it into at least three sections: two on either side and one in the middle, from your forehead to the nape of your neck. Separate the sections with hair clips.

, If you want big, flowy curls, separate out a larger section of hair. For tighter ringlets, make it a smaller section of hair. You can choose to make all the curls the same size or do a variety of different-sized curls. A standard size to start with would be about 1 inch (2.5 cm).


Use a comb to comb the section out so that it's straight and flat, like a ribbon.
If you want all your curls to be the exact same size, methodically divide the larger sections into smaller sections and rubber band the small sections so that each curl will be exactly the same.

, Take the section of hair you want to curl first and pinch the tip between your forefinger and thumb. Holding the tip securely, wrap the section of hair around your forefinger a couple of times. Gently slip the loop of hair from your finger, keeping the tip tucked inside. Carefully roll the hair up toward the roots until you reach the scalp.


This technique is difficult to master, and it might take a few tries before you're able to roll the section of hair all the way to your scalp without it coming undone. Be sure to keep the tip tucked in - otherwise, when it dries it will stick out at an odd angle.
Don't twist your hair, or you'll end up with frizz instead of shiny ringlets.If it helps, you can hold the tip of the section of hair against a small cylindrical object, like a marker cap, and roll your hair around the object until you reach your scalp before slipping it off.

, Use two bobby pins to pin the curl to your scalp in a cross shape. This will hold the curl securely in place as it dries.

, Keep rolling up sections of your hair in the same way and pinning them against your head with two crossed bobby pins. Continue until all of your hair has been rolled up and pinned.


The hair at the top of your head should be rolled away from your face, toward the back.
The direction in which you roll the hair on the sides and in the back will affect the final look. Experiment with rolling the curls in different directions - pointing either upward or downward - to see what you like best.For a neater final look, roll the curls into rows around your head. You should have 3-4 rows, depending on the size of the curls.

, This probably means you'll have to sleep on them so they have time to get totally dry. If you take them out while they're damp, your hair won't hold the curl. Sleep on a silk pillowcase to make sure your curls don't get crushed when you sleep.

, When they're completely dry, it's time to let them loose. Carefully unpin each curl and watch them unfurl. At this stage the curls will be tight, and your hair will look much shorter than it actually is.

, To keep the curls as curly as possible, use your fingers to gently separate and brush through the curls. If you want to create very loose waves, use a comb or brush to loosen and brush out the curls.


It will be difficult to pull the brush or comb through the curls at first. Work through them gently using your fingers, then use the brush or comb next.

, Add a little serum or mousse to prevent the curls from frizzing and finish your look. Keep it down or pin it back, 40s-style.

Adding these products to your roots while your hair is still wet will allow the products to set while your hair dries.Spritz several pumps of hair product, being careful to distribute it evenly in your hair. To use a volumizing gel or mousse, start with a dime- or quarter-sized amount depending on the length of your hair. Rub it between your palms and then carefully distribute evenly throughout your hair.

, If your hair dries fairly quickly, or if you're not in a rush, allow your hair to air-dry until it's about 80% dry. Letting your hair air-dry is actually the healthiest method of drying your hair, as you're not applying unnecessary heat to it. While your hair air-dries, you can make your morning coffee, put on your make-up for the day, etc.Using a hot air brush works best if your hair is about 80% dry. Your hair should look fairly dry, but still feel damp.

, If you're in a hurry, or if you want to create additional volume by blow-drying your hair, then use a blowdryer. Flip your head upside-down when you blow-dry your hair, as this will add some lift to your roots. Don't blow-dry your hair completely, as it should be about 80% dry when you use your hot air brush. It should appear dry, but still feel a bit damp.If you use a blowdryer, consider applying a heat protectant to your hair to prevent possible heat damage.

, You'll want to detangle your hair before brushing through it, as knots will make the hot air brush much harder to use. Be sure to comb through each section of hair before you brush it with a hot air brush., It shouldn't take more than a few minutes, but it's important that your brush is heated before you use it. If you use your hot air brush before it heats up, your hair will not curl.

, Diving your hair into sections will make the curling process much easier. Divide your hair into a top half and bottom half, separating the sections at ear level. Pin or tie the top section of your hair out of the way so that you can start by curling the bottom section of your hair.

Add finishing touches to your hair.",How to Curl Hair Using a Hot Air Brush2," Each section of hair should be about 1 inch thick. If you grab too much hair at once, the hot air brush will not be as effective. Brush each section of hair with a regular brush before using the hot air brush to avoid knots. Take your small handful of hair and place the hot air brush underneath it, near the roots.

, Pull the brush outwards towards the ends of your hair, while slowly turning the brush inward. As you turn the brush inward, guide your hair so that it curls under and around the hot brush.

, Roll the brush, with your hair curling around it, upward toward your roots. Once you reach your roots, hold the hot air brush in place for 10 seconds. Finally, pull the brush outwards towards the ends of your hair, and let your curl fall from the hot air brush.If your hair gets caught, gently untangle it from the brush.

You may have to divide your hair into 3-4 sections as opposed to just 2. Hold each section in place with pins or a hair tie until it is time to use the hot air brush on each section.


As with long hair, you should still use the hot air brush on small sections of hair (roughly 1 inch) at a time.

, Using a hot air brush on short hair is a bit different than using it on long hair. Lift up your first piece of hair and place the hot air brush underneath it, near the roots. With your brush hand, twirl the hot air brush outwards while keeping it against your roots. With your free hand, hold the section of hair down on top of the twirling hot air brush with your palm. Each section should be brushed for 15 seconds.With short hair, the hot air brush will give you waves and volume as opposed to curls.

, Curl the remaining sections of your hair with your hot air brush, working on one section at a time. After you use the hot air brush on each piece of hair, give it a light spritz with flexible hair spray.

, Hot air brushes are great tools to use when styling short hair. Twirl your hair with the hot air brush to easily create volume and hair flips. Take small sections of hair at a time, wrap them around the hot air brush, and twirl the hot air brush for 15 seconds.

, Using a hot air brush to dry your hair will dry it and style it at the same time. Dry one small section of hair at a time, and apply smoothing and volumizing serums.

Style and spray your curls.",How to Curl Hair by Twisting It," It's important that you do this on damp hair, rather than wet hair. You can do this technique after a shower, once your hair has air dried about halfway. If you don’t want or need to take a shower, you can simply dampen your hair with a spray bottle. The curls will hold best if done on damp hair., Before you start twisting it, it’s best to get rid of any tangles. Damp or wet hair is very fragile, so comb gently with a wide-tooth comb in order to prevent breakage.If you like having a particular part, use your comb to create it now. You will twist your hair around the part.

, By adding a product before you begin your twists, you’ll give your curls extra hold. You can use any product that you like, such as a curling mousse, a holding spray, or a texturizing sea salt spray. Anything that adds texture or hold to your hair will work great for this hairstyle. Run your hands through your hair to ensure the product is distributed evenly., Because your hair is naturally pretty dry, washing it regularly can strip it off its precious natural oils.If you do want to work with damp hair, know that your curls will be much tighter than if you began with dry hair. For looser curls, you'll want to create your twists by using a moisturizer or oil on dry hair., The number of sections you’ll need to create depends on two things: how much hair you have, and how tight or loose you want your curls. The more hair that you use in each twist, the looser the curls will be. In other words, a thick twist using two big chunks of hair will create looser curls then a skinny twist with two small pieces of hair.


If you have thin hair and you want loose curls, you may only need to twist two sections. If you have very thick hair and want tight curls, you’ll need much more.
When it comes to this hairstyle, this is the step that you’ll want to experiment with a bit. It will take a little bit of practice to determine which kinds of twists create your favorite kinds of curls.

, Separate a section into two pieces, and then began to twist them around each other, away from your face. The more tightly you twist, the tighter your curl, and vice versa. Twist as far as you can down the hair, and secure the end with a small rubber band. Pull your twist up and pin to the top of your head, so that it stays tightly twisted and secure.For afro-textured hair, remember to coat each section in a moisturizer or oil as you work through your hair. It is also helpful to coat your hands in this as well.If you want to avoid the little indentation left in your hair by hair ties, you can first put a small cotton swab or piece of paper towel around your hair, and tie the hair tie over it.
Repeat this step until all of your hair is twisted.

, If you worked with damp hair, it’s important to let your hair dry completely before taking out your twists.If you created your twists on dry hair with product, just make sure to let them sit at least five hours before untwisting them.


You don’t have to do your twists before bed. You can create your twists whenever you have enough time to let them dry.
Protect your twists against breakage and frizz by sleeping on a silk pillowcase, or covering your head with a silk headscarf., Before you remove your hair ties, gently press each twist with your fingertips to ensure they are completely dry. If they are, you can begin untwisting them. Take out your hair tie and use your fingers to gently unravel the twist. Do not brush your hair, as it will create extreme frizziness.


For afro-textured hair, make sure to apply moisturizer or oil to your hands before unraveling your twists. This will help to minimize frizz., Once you’ve undone all of your twists, run your fingers through your hair. This will help blend the sections back together, and work out any knots. Sometimes you’ll have a few wild pieces of hair, so use your hands to tame everything and mold your hair into the style you like.


Flip your head upside down and shake your hair to soften all of your curls up easily., You want to make sure your curls don’t deflate as the day progresses, so apply some holding spray to make them last. You can leave your curls down, or throw them up in a ponytail or a half up style. Your new curls will add volume to whichever style you choose.

Remove all the pins.,
Style your curls.",How to Create Pin Curls1," To create pin curls, you must start with evenly damp hair. Although you can just spray your hair to wet it, washing it will give you a clean slate and your curls will last for longer.


Towel dry hair after your wash to remove excess water.
If you have very thick hair, give a little time for your hair to air-dry before creating the curls. You may need to mist the ends lightly to get even dampness in this case.
The goal is to have your hair completely dry before removing the pins, so if you feel it is too wet let it dry a bit first. This goes even if you hair is not incredibly thick.
You can also apply a light-hold hairspray, setting lotion, or thin styling gel to help the curls hold.;
, Take small sections between ½ -1 inch (2.5 cm) wide, and wrap them between your thumb and forefinger to create a small loop. Continue rolling upwards in a spiral until your reach your head. Use 1-2 bobby pins to pin this spiral to the roots of your hair. Alternatively, you can use pin curl clips. These can be found at beauty supply stores and won’t leave lines.









For regular pin curls, these spirals should lay nearly flat against your head and should not stick out at all. But you can also make “stand-up” pin curls – these have more volume, like curls made with a roller.
If you use strands of hair that are too thick, the bobby pins will leave indentations when you remove them. If you have thick hair, use thinner sections to twirl.
Don’t twist your hair into rope-like strands before spiraling it inwards. Think of it more like a ribbon – wind the hair up without twisting.
Work from the top down, so that you don’t miss any strands of hair.

, Work your way around your head until all of your hair has been pinned to your scalp. Make sure that there are no loose strands, and that all the bobby pins feel secure.








, This will prevent your hair from becoming frizzy and any of the pins from coming loose.


Try using a cotton scarf or bandana, so that it will absorb some of the moisture from your hair. This will also reduce the static cling created from the friction of the scarf on your hair.
If you put your pin curls in at night, sleep with the scarf in. Make sure that it is secure enough that it won’t slip from your head while you snooze.

, It is easiest to create your pin curls at night before you go to bed and then sleep on them. You can also just sit around and wait for them to dry. Regardless of when you set your curls, be sure that your hair is completely dry before you remove the pins.


Avoid using a hair-dryer on your pin-curls, as it will make your hair frizzier and lose its curl. If you’re in a hurry, use a diffuser on your dryer to minimize frizz. Make sure the dryer is on the lowest setting.
If your hair is still damp, give it more time to air dry.
Test one of your curls to see if it is dry enough. Remove the pins from the single curl, and unravel your hair. Check to verify that the entire strand is dry. If it is, your pin curls are ready.

, Starting from the back and bottom of your hair, take all the pins out and slowly unravel each curl. They may immediately appear too spiral-esque, but don’t fret. When you finish removing all the pins you can style the curls to fit your preferences.








, Once all the pins are removed, the curls will need to be lightly brushed through to give that classic pin-curl look. This will also remove the piecey appearance they probably have.









If your hair is very fine or thin, start by simply finger-brushing your hair to break apart strands.
For thicker hair or a more vintage look, use a boar-bristle brush to comb out your strands directly.
Use a little pomade rubbed between your fingertips to add texture to your hair and reduce frizz.
Add hairspray to add extra hold to your hair for the whole day."

Let your hair air-dry for a few minutes until it is only damp.
If you are in a rush, you can spray hair down with a squirt bottle filled with water.
Use a curl enhancer or light setting lotion to keep the moisture even. It should also give you more polished results.

, For bantu curls, you will be spiraling your hair into little stacks on top of your head. Therefore, you will need sections that are a bit thicker than traditional pin curls.









Depending on the thickness and length of your hair, make sections that are between 1–3 inches (2.5–7.6 cm) wide across your scalp.
Work from the top and front of your head towards the bottom and rear.
If you have time, traditional bantu spirals are separated into a pattern on the scalp. Section off your pieces of hair into a square grid, diamond pattern, or small triangles.
Use your comb extensively during this process to make neat parts and even sections.

, Working one section at a time, twist the strand of hair into a tight rope-looking strand.









Twist each strand as tightly and far as you can manage. The tighter you twist it, the fuller your curls will be.
With enough twisting, the strand of hair will want to curl in on itself. Continue with each strand until you reach this point.
To vary the direction of the curls, spin some clockwise and others counterclockwise.

, These spirals of hair will jut out from your head like little knobs, rather than lying flat like traditional pin curls.









Use 1-2 bobby pins to secure the ends of each spiral to the hair at the scalp.
If your hair is thick and long, each spiral will likely protrude much further from your head. Be sure that they are firmly pinned in this case.

, The curls will not be ready until the hair is completely dry, but similar to traditional pin curls, avoid using a blow-dryer and ruining your hard work.









It is easiest to place this in your hair at night and to sleep on them, so that they are prepared and ready for you in the morning.
Because these curls contain more hair in each spiral than traditional pin curls, they may take longer to dry. Be sure to take this extra time into account.
Again, use a diffuser on the lowest heat setting if you’re in a rush. The curls should still be OK if you are careful.

, This will help keep your pins and curls in place while you work or sleep. Use a cotton bandana or scarf to absorb excess moisture from you hair, and avoid using any fabric that the pins might get caught in.

, Once you are certain your hair is dry, remove all the bobby pins beginning at the back and working towards the top and front. Unravel each curl once you finish removing the pins.








, Begin by gently finger-brushing apart strands to remove their tight coiled appearance. For fuller curls, use a boar-bristle brush to comb strands into big, luxurious waves.

Remove the headband.,
Style your hair.",How to Create Pin Curls3," Make sure that it smooth and has no tangles or teasing, as this will make your hair more difficult to remove from the headband style.









Your hair can be wet or dry for this style and will need several hours to set. If your hair is dry, you’ll need to prep it beforehand with hairspray or some kind of styling product.
Avoid styling your hair with heat prior to trying this method of curling. Allow your hair to be in its natural form.
Make sure your hair is parted down it’s normal line, so that the curls you create will fall to the correct side.

, It should be laying over the top of your hair, not under it.









Use a headband that is no wider than ½ an inch thick and is elastic.
Avoid using a headband that is cylindrical, as this will be more likely to roll off the top of your head.
Don’t use a headband with any beading, sequins, or adornment, as your hair will get caught and become incredibly difficult to remove.

, Starting at the front of your head, take pieces of hair about one inch thick, and twist them until they become very tight and rope-like. Then, wrap them around the headband towards the back of your head.









Try to keep the curl tightly wrapped around the headband in a spiral, so that it does not take up too much of the available space on the headband.
Repeat this process from the front, all the way around to the back of your hair.
For smaller spiral curls, use thinner strands of hair. For big, bouncy curls, increase the size of the hair sections you wrap.

, As with most heat-less curling methods, it is easiest to let the curls set overnight. Wait at least six hours before taking off the headband.

, Once your hair has been given enough time to hold its curl, it is safe to take of the headband. Start by unravelling the strands of hair at the back of your head towards the front. The curls will probably start out very tight, but don’t worry as they will relax over time.








, Depending on your desired curl-tightness, you may prefer not to brush out curls too much. To give these curls a more natural appearance, finger-brush them or gently comb them to break apart the strands.









Use a texturizing hairspray or pomade to give a natural appearance to the curls.
Use hairspray to set the style.

Buy a 1"" barrel if you are a curling iron novice.,
Choose a 1-1/4"" barrel if you have medium to long hair.,

Look at the curling iron's heat settings.,
Decide between a curling iron and a curling wand.,
Choose the shape of your iron.,
Decide on the right material.",How to Choose a Curling Iron," Curling irons range from 3/8"" to 2"" widths, and each of these barrels produces a different kind of curl. For tight curls, go for a smaller width; if you want looser curls, go for a larger barrel.


Thin, flat hair works better with smaller barrels. Even if these tight curls lose shape throughout the day, the hair still looks styled. Large barrels that create loose curls won't provide lasting curls for this hair type.
Thick hair that retains shape easily will hold looser curls from larger barrels much better.;
, Barrels that are 3/8"", 1/2"", and 5/8"" are great for producing tight curls.


These small barrels work better on hair that is short to just past the shoulders.
These tiny curling irons are great for long or short hair that is naturally very curly. The size of the barrel can provide touch ups if a few strands aren't curled properly.Girls with straight hair can get the tight, kinky curls with these sized barrels. The process is time-consuming, but the look is completely obtainable.
These barrels work great on thinner hair.
This barrel is great for coiled, spiral locks and a perm look., This barrel produces slightly looser curls that work great for vintage styles or updos. You also can get corkscrew curls with this barrel.Gently brush out these curls for softer locks.


This barrel works with short or medium hair.

, The 1"" barrel is considered by most to the be the overall go-to styling tool for any curl for any length of hair. If you want to buy one curling iron, or are buying your first one, consider starting with a 1"".


This barrel works for short bobs, medium lengths, and long layered curls.
This width can create natural tight curls, and when brushed out, the curls can appear natural and flowing on longer hair., This is considered the most popular barrel size for women with longer hair. This size creates a uniform curl.This barrel gives you looping curls or defined natural, soft waves. It can also be used on short hair to give volume and produce softer, looser curls.

, The larger the barrel, the looser the curls. This 1-1/2"" barrel gives loose, voluminous curls. This is a good barrel to use if you want those messy beach curls or ""Victoria's Secret"" curls.


This size barrel works best on longer hair. Some medium lengths can use it, but the barrel is too big for short hair., This large barrel only works for long hair. The 2"" barrel isn't really designed to create curls, but to give rounded texture to the ends of your hair.


This is good for girls with straight hair who want a little shape but not defined curls., Different hair types need different heat settings. Thick hair can stand higher heat while thin hair needs much lower temperatures to prevent damage. Higher temperatures are also needed if you are curling large amounts of hair at one time.Many curling irons have adjustable heat settings. This is ideal because you can change the temperature depending on your specific hair type.
You should never use temperatures up to 400 degrees. Those are temperatures better left to stylists and professionals.Try staying between 300-340 degrees when styling hair.If you have fine, thin hair, go as low as 175 degrees.

, A curling iron has a spring-loaded clamp that holds your hair in place as you curl. These are the most common and found in most major retailers. A curling wand is clipless, and you have to manually curl your hair around the wand.The benefits of a curling iron are that they have a clamp to hold the hair in place. They also come in a wide variety of barrel sizes, and are found easily in stores.
The benefits of a curling wand are that you wrap the ends last so it reduces split ends, it can get closer to the roots to give you more volume, and it doesn't leave a crease or kink in the hair like the clamp on a curling iron.Curling wands can give better beach curls and most people serious about curls prefer them, but they do take some skill to learn to use.

, Curling irons don't just come in one shape - there are many different shapes that produce different effects. If you'd like a specific look, try one of these:


Cone shaped wands. These wands usually have a smaller end and widen to a thicker base. They also come in the reverse, with a thicker point and smaller base. These give precise curls, and allow for you to make thicker and thinner curls with the different sizes on one tool.You can get beach waves with these types of tools. These can create romantic curls that widen at the bottom.
Straight barrels. This is what is found on typical curling irons. This gives a uniformed shape to your curls, allowing you to have ringlets and coils.
Spiral barrels. These barrels have raised spiral or ribbon ridges to guide the hair into shape.Pearl barrels. These have small pearls or balls along the barrel. This is used for curls that look more like natural curly hair without a defined perfect shape. It's good for wild, natural curls on any length.Double or tripe barrels. These are also known as wavers. They have two or three barrels made together that resembles fingers. Wavers give the hair figure 8 shaped waves instead of curls. These are best for longer hair.Flat irons. Another way to curl your hair is to use a flat iron. This works with long or short hair, and can be a way to curl your hair if you already own a straightener.

, Not all curling irons are made the same. When choosing a curling iron, it is important to pay attention to what material it is made of. Some of these materials are better on your hair than others.


Ceramic and Tourmaline curling irons are popular and one of the safest. If you curl your hair often, this is the material you want. They maintain a consistent temperature throughout the barrel. They release negative ions that smoothes the hair's cuticle, eliminates frizz, and makes it appear smooth and shiny.Titanium barrels are good for hair that is coarse, hard to heat, doesn't hold heat, or unmanageable. They also contain the same negative ions that help reduce frizz and protect hair like ceramic or tourmaline.Chrome and gold barrels heat well, but they won't fight frizz. While cheaper, chrome curling irons can have hot spots and damage your hair.
Metal steam barrels can be good for thin hair that won't hold curl. They release steam, which helps replace the moisture the metal removes. The steam helps the hair hold curl."

, You may want to wash your hair before you curl, though this is not necessary. You can achieve excellent curls by dampening your hair with water from the faucet or a spray bottle. Damp hair will allow you to bring out more curl, and dry hair will create gentler waves.








If you decide to wash your hair beforehand, you'll want to dry excess moisture out of your hair with a towel, blow dryer, or by air drying until it is only damp.
Volumizing product might be just what you need to bring out more pronounced curls.

, For especially thick hair, it can be difficult to wind your hair in the rollers without first separating it into sections to make it more manageable. Less thick hair types can likely forego sectioning, and move straight into rolling.


Extra thick hair will likely have to use rollers in many small sections to achieve a noticeable curl., You should not need pins or clips to secure the velcro rollers in place. If the roller is not grabbing your hair and is loose, it could be that you've wound too much hair on the roller. Unroll it and reduce the amount of hair in that segment. Try rolling again until you have a more secure hold.








, Winding too much hair on your roller can diminish its effects, lead to tangles, or cause the roller to not stick in place. Start with one roller halfway up the segment of hair you are working with and roll it to the top. The bottom of the segment of hair should still be draping downward. Use a second roller, start at the bottom, and roll the hair up to meet the first roller.








, Take a segment of hair from the section you are working on that is no thicker than your roller and brush it straight. You'll want your hair to be tangle free before you put in your rollers to minimize tangles and frizz. Pull the hair so it is taut and there is no slack. You're now ready to roll.








, Starting from the ends of your hair, wind your hair around the roller so the hair curls down and inward toward your scalp. Continue rolling your hair onto the roller until the roller is snug against your scalp.









The velcro on the roller should grab the hair and hold the roller in place
Thicker hair might require more than one roller per section of hair. If the roller does not stick or is loose, you have rolled too much hair on it.
You might use larger rollers on the top parts of your hair and smaller rollers on the bottom parts to create a natural looking landscape of ringlets., It's easy to create waves and bounce with wide rollers. When aiming for a gentler curl, you should begin with dry hair. Lightly mist the section of hair you are working on with hair spray or volumizing spray. Pull the section taut at a 90 degree angle from your head, then roll from the end until it is snug against your head, as you would normally.








You could also lift the hair at an angle higher than 90 degrees to create even more volume.

, While your hair is still damp, apply an anti-frizz serum and blow dry your hair lightly. After doing this, you should brush straight any of the loose hair that you did not put into rollers.









Use a blow dryer on the hair for about 5 minutes, blowing down the shafts of hair to minimize frizz., The more time you allow your rollers to set in your hair, the stronger and longer lasting the curl. You should wait at least 10-20 more minutes before unrolling, though those with thicker hair may want to wait longer. If your hair is damp, you can lightly blow dry until your hair is dry, and then remove the rollers.Anti-frizz, styling spray, or finishing cream can help ensure a more polished looking finish., Carefully unwind each roller. Pulling the rollers out can leave rollers stuck in your hair and result in a frizzy mess. As you unwind your roller, hold the segment of hair above the roller with your free hand to guide your unwinding.









By holding the hair above the roller, you will keep your hair from accidentally getting stuck to the velcro or re-tangled in the roller., Use your comb to gently combine the various segments of hair together. You can also use your fingers to merge segments back together.









Adding baby powder or talcum powder to the roots of your hair can help your curls last even longer.
You can also set your curls with hairspray to maintain your look."

Heat up your curling iron.,
Prepare your hair.,
Separate your hair into sections.,
Begin curling your hair.,
Curl additional sections of hair.,
Set the style.","How to Get Big, Bouncy Curls1"," Plug your curling iron in and turn it on to a temperature equivalent to the thickness of your hair (the thicker it is, the higher the temperature). For big curls, use a curling iron at least 1” wide; the wider the barrel of the iron, the larger your curls will be. Give the iron at least 2-3 minutes to heat fully before attempting to curl your hair.;
, Hair must be totally dry before being curled with an iron, so use a blow-dryer if necessary to dry it out. Add in a heat-protectant spray or mousse to keep your hair glossy and prevent it from getting fried. If desired, you can also add in a curl-enhancing product to help create big, voluminous curls with your iron.








, Curling your hair is a timely process, and you will get the best results if you work in sections. Tie the upper ⅔ of your hair into a ponytail on the top of your head, and leave the bottom-most layer down. Brush out your hair to remove any knots and tangles to prepare it for curling.








, Take sections of hair about 1” wide and wrap them around the barrel of your curling iron, starting in the center (rather than the ends) of each strand. Hold the hair in place around the barrel of the iron for 5-10 seconds, and then release the curl. Repeat this process throughout the entire bottom layer of your hair.








, Let down half of the hair in your ponytail, and brush through it to prepare it for curling. Following the aforementioned instructions, wrap each 1” section of hair around the barrel starting from the center of the strand until all your hair has been curled. Finish up with the top layer once the middle section is completed.








, Turn your blow dryer onto the ‘cool’ setting and blast your hair with the cool air. The temperature will return to normal in your hair, helping to keep it in place for longer. To finish it off, flip your head upside down and mist all of your hair with hairspray. Flip your head back over and adjust your hair to your liking. You’re finished!

Tie the toilet paper so it is loose, but secure.,
Repeat these steps for the other sections of your hair.,
Leave the toilet paper in overnight.,
Remove the toilet paper in the morning and apply hairspray.",How to Curl Hair With Toilet Paper," You will need a standard roll of toilet paper, preferably toilet paper that is thick and durable. A thicker, more durable toilet paper will make it easier to curl and tie the toilet paper into your hair without the risk of tearing or ripping of the toilet paper.You can also use paper towels or paper napkins if you do not have access to toilet paper. You will need to tear the paper towels or napkins into thin strips, about as wide as a piece of toilet paper. This will make it much easier to curl and tie the towels or napkins into your hair.;
, You should also have a comb with a long handle close by, as you can use the comb to help you part and separate your hair into sections. Parting your hair into even sections will make it easier to curl and tie your hair with the toilet paper.If you do not have access to a comb with a long thin handle, you can use a chopstick or the tip side of a paintbrush to part and section off your hair. Make sure you do not scrap the chopstick or the paintbrush against your scalp as you do not want to damage your scalp when you are parting your hair.

, You should have a spray bottle of water prepared so you can dampen your hair before you curl it with the toilet paper. Having hair that is damp, but not soaking wet, will allow your hair to hold the curls more effectively.








You may not need a spray bottle of water if you plan on curling your hair once you have dried your hair so it is damp but not soaking wet. This item is only necessary if your hair is dry and needs to be dampened.

, You may also want to have hairspray close by so you can apply it once you have curled your hair with the toilet paper. This will help to keep the curls in place and ensure they look good for a day or several days.You should look for hairspray that has good holding power. You may want to test the hairspray on a piece of hair to ensure it does not get crunchy or greasy when it dries.

, Start by holding three squares of toilet paper and tearing them off the roll. Tear off as many strips of toilet paper, three squares each, as you need to curl your entire head. You may decide to tear the strips off as you go so you have enough toilet paper to curl all of your hair.








If you are using paper towels, you should tear it so it forms two to four equal strips that are about 2 inches wide. Then, repeat this until you have a stack of strips or tear the paper towels as you go so you have enough strips to curl all of your hair.

, Once you have the strips of toilet paper, you should fold them once length wise. This will create curls that are of an average size. This will also make the toilet paper stay in your hair more effectively and prevent you from tearing the toilet paper too much when you put it in your hair.








If you want to create wider curls, you should fold the strips once lengthwise and then fold them in half lengthwise again. This will create strips that are a little thicker, leading to thicker curls.

, You may want to gather most of your hair, except for the bottom layer, and clip it to the side so you can focus on one section at a time. Then, use the comb or chopstick to separate a 1-2 inch section of hair.If your hair is thick, you may use 1 inch sections so the toilet paper stays in place more effectively.
Once you have a section of hair, spritz it with water using the spray bottle. You just want it to be a little damp so it will hold the curl.

, Starting at the bottom of your hair, place the toilet paper strip on your hair and slowly roll your hair over the toilet paper. Continue wrapping your hair around the toilet paper strip until you reach your scalp.








If you only want curls at the bottom area of your hair, you may stop wrapping your hair midway up your hair. If you want full curls from the top to bottom of your hair, you would roll the toilet paper all the way up to your scalp.

, Once you have rolled your hair around the toilet paper, you will need to tie the toilet paper so your hair is secure. Take either ends of the toilet paper strip and loop them together so they form a loose knot. Try not to tie the strip too tight around your hair as this may cause the strip to tear or rip.








Tie the toilet paper more than once if you have enough paper to do so, but make sure the knot is still a little loose. The hair should hang down in a loose but secure roll.

, You can then repeat these same steps for the remaining sections of your hair, wrapping and tying the toilet paper strips into your hair in 1-2 inch sections. Make sure you tie the toilet paper strips so they are secure but not too tight.








If any of the toilet paper strips tear or rip while you are tying them, unroll your hair from the toilet paper and roll it again with a fresh strip. Try not to tug or pull too hard on the toilet paper as this could cause it to rip or tear.

, You should let your curled hair stay in overnight so the curls can set. You may need to sleep on your back so the side sections of your hair do not get messed up. You can also try sleeping on one side, carefully pushing the toilet paper rolls away from your face.If you are in a rush, you can also use a blow dryer to set the curls. You may need to blow dry your hair for 10 to 20 minutes, moving the dryer around your head, to make sure the curls stay in.

, In the morning, you can remove the toilet paper by gently untying them or by ripping them out with a few gentle tears. You should then have large curls that you can separate carefully with your fingers. Try not to touch your curls too much as this can create frizz.








You can set your curls by spritzing them with hairspray so they stay in place all day. You may also add hair accessories like decorative bobby pins, a paper flower, or a headband to give your curls a little something extra.

Heat up your rollers.,
Prepare your hair.,
Begin rolling up your hair.,
Roll the rest of your head into curlers.,
Wait.,
Remove the hot rollers.,
Finish off the style.","How to Get Big, Bouncy Curls2"," Make sure all your rollers are in place in their case, and then plug it in to allow them to heat up. Some rollers have a light on the outside that show when they are fully heated; otherwise, wait 5-10 minutes for the rollers to heat before inserting them into your hair.

, While you wait for the rollers to heat up, make sure your hair is ready to be curled. Just like with a curling iron, your hair must be totally dry to be used in hot rollers. Blow dry your hair to remove any moisture, and brush it out to remove any tangles. You can add mouse to your hair prior to drying it to give it added volume.








, Starting with the hair located in the front of your head just above your forehead, section off a piece 2”-3” thick. Wrap this section around the hair, leaving 1”-2” inches of the ends left out while you roll it up. When the hot roller gets to your scalp, tuck the end piece underneath to help hold it in place. Clamp the roller cover over the top of the roll, and you’re ready to move onto the next section.








, Working from the top down, section off your hair into 2”-3” sections and continue to roll them into the curlers using the aforementioned steps. If your hair is very thick, you may need to use smaller sections of hair. Clamp each roller into place until you have finished rolling up all of your hair into the curlers.








, Hot rollers take a bit of time to work their magic on your hair, so sit back and relax for 20-30 minutes until the rollers are cool. This is a great time to finish getting ready for the day, or to accomplish other routine tasks while you wait.

, One by one working from the top down, remove the clamps and then the rolls from your hair. Refrain from unravelling the curls much, as they may lose their bounce and volume if you touch them too much. Continue until you have removed all of the hot rollers from your head.








, Before touching the curls at all, mist them with some hairspray to help keep them in place. Then, using your fingers only (not a brush) comb through your hair to break up the curls and help them to look more natural. If necessary you can add a final touch of hairspray, and you’re finished!

Remove the socks from your hair.,
Finish up your style.","How to Get Big, Bouncy Curls3"," To curl your hair with socks, you will need 3-4 clean tube socks, a brush, and a spray bottle filled with water.

, Brush out any tangles in your hair, and section it out into 3-4 parts - equal to the number of tube socks you have. If you have three socks, put one large section of hair on the top of your head and two equal-sized sections on either side of your head. If you have 4 socks, put two sections on the top of your head and two on the lower sides.To keep the sections apart, you can use hair clips or ponytails.

, Wrap your hair around the center of a tube sock, similar to the style you would wrap your hair around a hot roller. Leave the ends of your hair out of the roll until you’ve reached your scalp, and then tuck them underneath the roll you’ve created. Use the two loose ends of the tube sock to tie a knot, thus securing the sock roll.








, Use the aforementioned process to roll the remaining sections of hair into individual tube socks. Tie them off as near to your scalp as you can, as this will prevent them from coming unrolled while you sleep.

, Use your spray bottle filled with water to lightly mist your hair. This will help your hair to form the curls better, as it will dry in the spiral-shape around the sock rather than remaining limp. Don’t get your hair soaking wet, just damp to the touch.








, This style is primarily intended to be done overnight. You can set up the sock rolls before you go to bed, and then sleep on them at night for big bouncy curls in the morning. If you don’t want to sleep on the socks, you will have to wait for your hair in this style for at least 5-6 hours to get the optimum curls.

, Working from the bottom up, untie each of the socks and unroll your hair. Don’t brush through them with your fingers or anything yet, work on simply detangling them from the socks.








, Your hair should be in large, bouncy curls as a result of the socks. Mist them lightly with hairspray to help set them, and then brush through them with your fingers to break them apart a bit and to add some volume. When you’re finished playing with the style, you’re finished!

Finished.

","How to Get Big, Bouncy Curls4"," Bantu knots are many tiny buns that you space out over the entirety of your head. As a result, it is necessary to make sure that your hair is totally free of knots and completely smooth. Brush through your hair, and then mist it with a bit of water in a spray bottle so that it is slightly damp to the touch.








, Depending on the thickness of your hair, the number of sections you use will vary. Brush your hair into sections 2”-3” wide, and separate each of them with a hair clip or ponytail. These should cover your whole head with not much of a pattern.








, Take a single section of hair, and twirl it around several times to make it rope-like and more spiral shaped. Then, loop the twisted strand onto itself several times to create a small bun that sits on your scalp. Use 1-2 bobby pins to pin the ends of your hair to your scalp, thus securing the bun in place.








, Work around your head twisting each separate strand of hair into a rope, and then spiraling this into a small bun to be pinned to the top of your head. The end result may look kind of silly, as you will have close to a dozen small buns spaced out over your head.

, Being a no-heat style, bantu knots take a bit of time to form curls. Therefore, it is best to do this at night and then allow your hair to set while you sleep, so that you can wake up with the curls you want. Otherwise, plan on waiting 5-6 hours with your hair like this in order to get your curls.

, Work around your head from the bottom up, and take out each tiny bun. Unpin it and allow the spiral to unravel, but do not begin brushing through the curls yet as this will make it harder to take out the other knots. Continue this process until you have all the knots removed.








, When your hair is down and loose, you can use your fingers or a wide-tooth comb to brush through the curls a bit. The more you brush through them, the more volume they’ll gain. Finish the style with a bit of hairspray to hold it in place, and pin back some of your hair if desired.

",How to Curl Hair with Braids1," Shampoo and condition your hair like you usually would. When you're done, comb but do not brush your hair. Pin the top half of your hair on the top of your head.;
, The number and thickness of braids will depend on how curly you want your hair. The important thing is to braid tightly, because a looser braid will create more of a wave than a curl. Try to braid tightly or the curls will be really frizzy and possible oddly kinked. Start as close to the scalp as possible. After you're done with the bottom layer, let down the top half and repeat the step.








, Braiding hair that is slightly wet also helps when curling your hair.









Use two or three large, thick French braids for thick, luxurious curls. The benefit of using two French braids is that you can wear them the day before, keep them intact overnight, and have curls the next day––getting two distinct hair styles in a row. French braids will also help the curls start up higher towards the roots of the hair.
Braid one-inch (2.5cm) strands for loose curls. Clip each one on your head so that they don't get mixed up.
Use smaller braids for tight ""crimped"" or ""afro"" style curls.

, This will take longer if you have thicker hair, as you will have had to do more braids. It's best to sleep on them (or wear them one day and release the braids the next). The braids should keep your hair from getting tangled, but if you're worried that it will get messed up while you sleep, you can use a shower cap or something to protect it.


When you wake up, before you take out the braids, spin around a few times/give yourself a head massage. This helps stimulate the hair follicles - helping your hair stay 'alive' looking. If you have time, whip your hair for a few minutes.

, Don't use a brush to separate your hair.








, Comb your hair with a wide-toothed comb or just rake your fingers through it. Fluff it up a little and either let it sit as is, or add a hair accessory.








, Adding sculpting gel will keep the hair from getting frizzy, while the hairspray will ensure that humidity doesn't cause your curls to wilt.

You know what works or your hair the best, so use whatever conditioner, oil, cream, and other products for your hair, as needed.;
, If necessary, use a detangling spray before combing or brushing out any tangles.






Comb your hair with a wide tooth comb only, so as not to break the hair or split the ends.

, You want it damp enough to style, yet not so wet that it can’t dry out and hold its curls.





, Prep them with a quarter-size spritz of setting lotion or mousse. Place the product on your fingertips and run it through the length of the bangs. Position a roller under the bangs, about two inches from the tips. This should give you enough hair to wind around once and catch in the roller. Continue wrapping till it touches the scalp. Get as tight a wrap as possible to prevent hair from loosening while you sleep.





, Keep them separated with claw clips.





, Try to make even rows, using large foam rollers. Section the hair roughly the width of the roller; the amount depends on how many curls you want. Prep with more setting lotion or mousse, making sure you coat the entire length of hair for each roller.






For ringlets, position rollers vertically as you wind the hair inward. For fuller, softer curls, position the rollers horizontally.











, Switch to medium or small rollers as you get closer to your neck.





, These come from the impression in the hair left by the plastic clasp or closure on the foam roller. To keep this from happening, gently reposition the clasp from the top of the curl to the bottom after the roller has been fastened. Anchor the closure with either an aluminum duckbill clip or a bobby pin.





, For a carefree, tousled look, lightly run your fingers through your hair, just enough to loosen the curls. If you must use a hairbrush, just touch up the ends of each curl.

Pick henna that will blend well with your natural hair color.,
Choose henna with a green, earthy color.,
Use indigo henna as an alternative for dark hair.,
Make sure your henna is body art quality.",How to Prepare Henna Hair Color1," Henna does not change your hair color entirely but instead blends with it. As the dye fades, it will return to your natural color. Choose a color you think would blend well with your natural hair color. If you have dark hair, choose a darker, richer henna color. If your hair is light, keep in mind that you may need to dye it multiple times to darken it.Grey or white hair will dye closely to the color created by the dye. You will, however, have to apply the henna evenly to avoid darkening one part of your hair more than another.
Most henna will dye your hair in tints of red. Darker henna (indigo henna) will dye your hair black, but still may have a red tint. Even blonde henna dye will result in a strawberry blonde.;
, Pure henna, when dry, will be a color between green and brown. It will also smell like grass clippings. Do not buy henna in other colors, or henna that smells like chemicals. Henna with either of those qualities may have been mixed with artificial hair dye., Although indigo henna is not pure henna (as it is mixed with indigo powder), it is safe to use and ideal for darker hair colors. Indigo henna will dye your hair a deep black with tints of red. Unlike most henna, indigo henna has to be used quickly after mixing. Plan to use the indigo henna the same day that you mix it.Make sure that your indigo henna does not contain PPD, which can be a skin irritant., Body art quality henna does not contain any additives or chemicals. This henna also contains more lawsone, a molecule that rinses out of your hair better and has a richer hair color. If you want to use henna alongside synthetic hair dye, you can dye over body art quality hair dye without damaging your hair.If the henna is body art quality, it will say so on the package. Do not buy henna if it does not say this on the label.

Heat up the curling iron.,
Make sure your hair is completely dry.,
Brush out any tangles while the iron heats up.,
Apply a heat protection spray.,
Split your hair into sections.,
Start curling.,
Hold the iron in place.,
Move on to the next curl.,
Loosen your curls (optional).,
Set your curls with hairspray (optional).",How to Curl Hair1," Most curling irons will need about 1-5 minutes to heat up before you can use them. If you try to curl your hair with the iron before it reaches the correct temperature, the curls will not hold.


Some curling irons will have different settings which you can play around with until you achieve the best result. Try to keep it at the lowest temperature possible though, to cause less damage to your hair. Look for curling irons that say ""No Damage"" on the box.
A good guide is 320ºF (160ºC) for fine hair and 430ºF (220ºC) for thicker hair.;
, Putting a hot iron on damp hair can seriously damage it — not because the iron is too hot, but because the water will turn to scalding steam. Wet hair is also more fragile than dry hair, making it more prone to heat damage. Play it safe, and completely dry your hair first. Run a blowdryer over any damp spots. (Although, try to wait it out. Depending on your hair thickness, this may take time. But, if you want to reduce heat on your hair, you can wait. However, if using a blow drying is the best option for you, keep it on a cool setting.)


If you’re not sure whether or not your hair is completely dry, set your dryer on the “cold shot” setting and go over your entire head with it. The cool air will make any damp spots feel cold to the touch.

, Start at the end of your hair and brush out the bottom few inches or centimeters, then work your way up until you can easily brush through the length of your hair. This reduces damage to you hair like split ends, fallout, etc.

, If you regularly use heat to style your hair, it's really important that you use a heat protection spray. It will protect your hair from the damage caused by exposure to high temperatures and prevent it from becoming dry and frazzled looking. Just spray it liberally all over your hair before curling.


Heat protector sprays can be found at most drug stores and hair salons.

, Even if you have thin hair, you'll get better results if you work with small sections of hair. That way, you can make sure you're curling everything and curl in a more uniform style. Create sections that are slightly smaller in diameter than the curling iron.


Pin or clip up the top section of your hair. Using your thumbs, grab everything that's above the top of your ears and clip it up on top of your head.
Release upper sections as you work. When the bottom section of hair is finished, unclip your hair and let out a little more, clipping up the excess again. Continue working this way until all your hair is curled.
Remember that using bigger sections of hair will result in bigger, looser curls, while using smaller sections of hair will give you smaller, tighter ringlets.

, Now that all the prep work is out of the way, you're ready to start curling. Begin by taking a small section of hair and wrap it around the curling iron, beginning at the top or bottom, depending on the type of tongs:









Some curling irons will have a clamp near the handle. If this is the type of curling tongs you're using, open the clamp and position the end of the hair at the lower end of the barrel, near the handle, then close the clamp to secure. Then you can wrap that entire section of hair around the iron, by rolling the iron upwards towards your roots. Stop rolling when you get about an inch away from the roots, to prevent the iron from burning your scalp.
Other curling irons, often referred to as wands, don't have a clamp. With this type of iron, you should start near the top of your hair and use your hand to wrap a piece of hair around the iron. You will need to hold the end of your hair in place while that section of hair curls. Some curling wands provide a safety glove that you can wear while doing this, to prevent your hand from burning.

, You will need to hold the curling iron with the hair wrapped around it for a few seconds, while the hair heats up and curls. This should take approximately 10 seconds, but the time will vary according to the individual curling iron and the temperature it's heated to.


Play around to find a time that creates a perfect curl with your iron, but remember to start out with a lower time to prevent your hair from burning.
After 10 seconds, let go of your hair to release the curl. If your hair is still a little flat, try pinning it while it's still curled. Once your hair is completely cool, take all the pins out of each curl.

, Once you are happy with how your first curl turned out, move on to the next piece of hair and do the same steps as before.


To achieve a uniform look, wrap all the curls around the iron in the same direction.
Alternating the direction of the wrap creates a more natural effect.

, If you want your hair to look softer and looser, run your fingers through the curls a few times. The curls will pull down and loosen up as you do so. You can also turn your head upside down and use your fingers to fluff up and separate the curls.


Once you have curled your hair, do not brush it with a hairbrush. It will loosen the curls too much and they will fall out.
If you brush out curls with a hairbrush, your hair will look wavy rather that curly, which can be a nice style in itself.

, If you tend to have straight hair, or you're worried about your curls turning frizzy or falling out throughout the day, mist some hairspray over your curls. If you want tight curls, you can spray each curl individually as soon as you've finished with it, but if you want a looser style, wait until the curls have relaxed a little and only spray them when you've finished curling your entire head.


Choose a loose hold hairspray so your curls aren't too stiff and you hair doesn't feel too ""crunchy"". Hold the can about 12-14 in (30.5 cm - 35.5 cm) away from your head and spray evenly around your head. Be careful not to apply too much.Never apply hairspray to the curls while they are still wrapped around the iron. The combination of the heat from the irons and the alcohol in the hairspray will fry your hair.
However, if your hair is fine or limp, you can create a more durable curl by spraying each section before wrapping. Spraying before wrapping instead of after will also result in curls that are softer and less “crunchy.”

Understand that using henna on your skin or hair is not necessarily safe.,
Read product labels carefully.,
Avoid using henna on all children.",How to Be Safe when Using Henna1," The Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has received multiple reports from consumers who experienced long-lasting and severe side effects from the application of henna for temporary tattoos. Side effects include, but are not limited to, red lesions that are raised and weeping, loss of pigmentation of the skin, blisters, increased sunlight sensitivity, redness, and permanent scarring.These reactions can occur immediately after getting a temporary tattoo using traditional red henna or ""black henna.""
Reactions from temporary henna tattoos can also occur up to two or three weeks after receiving the tattoo.
You can also experience adverse side effects from hair dye that contains “black henna.”;
, If you are purchasing henna to use at home on your skin or hair, make sure you examine each ingredient listed on the label. Avoid any color additives in henna dyes to be used on the skin. If you are getting a henna tattoo from a tattoo artist or your hair dyed by a professional, make sure you inquire about the ingredients in the dye they will use on your skin or hair.


Ask specifically about the inclusion of p-phenylenediamine, or PPD, and avoid getting a tattoo with this additive.

, Children can be particularly sensitive to henna. Skin sensitivities and allergic reactions to henna can occur in children.Children with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency are at particular risk, as applying henna to the skin of children with this condition can cause a life-threatening condition called hemolysis.
Seek immediate medical attention if a child with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency has been exposed to henna.

Keep up your color.",How to Henna Your Hair Red," While true henna has a reddish, coppery tone, the color is translucent so it blends with your hair color. That means it won’t look the same on everyone. The lighter your natural hair color, the more vivid red your hair will be. With very dark hair, henna likely won’t impart much color, so you’ll just wind up with added shine.Pale blonde, gray, and white hair will wind up with a true, vibrant red shade.
Mid-tone hair colors, such as dirty blonde and light brown, typically turn a richer, almost auburn shade.
If you have red or auburn hair, you likely won’t see much change with henna. However, it can enhance the natural tones in your hair and cover grays.
Dark hair shades, including chocolate brown and black, won’t see any real color change with henna, but your locks will look shinier and glossier afterward.
If you do have some grays mixed in with your natural color, keep in mind that you won’t wind up with a uniform color. The henna will make the gray pieces appear like highlights, which can be a nice look with light and mid tone hair shades. With dark hair, though, the red highlights may look strange.;
, The amount of henna that you’ll need depends on the length of your hair because the longer your hair is, the more henna you’ll need. Henna powder is typically available in boxes, but you can also purchase it as a brick. Read the package instructions carefully to determine how much henna you’ll need.


If you have short hair no longer than your chin, a 100-gram box of henna is usually enough.For shoulder-length hair, start with 200 grams of henna.If your hair is past your shoulders, you’ll want to have at least 300 grams of henna on hand.For extremely long hair, you may need as much as 500 grams of henna to color your entire head., Warm water is the most common liquid to combine with the powder, and you’ll want to add enough to create a thick, mud-like paste with the henna. Try to remove as many as the lumps as possible, so the mixture has a smooth texture like yogurt.You can use other liquids to mix your henna. Lemon, orange, and grapefruit juice are common alternatives. If you don’t mind the smell, vinegar is another option.To get the consistency right, it helps to add the liquid a little at a time so you have better control. If the mixture is too thick and stiff, you can add more liquid. It's also a good idea to have extra henna powder on hand, so you can add a little more if the mixture becomes too thin or runny. Just as with the liquid, though, add the powder in small amounts to ensure you don't overdo it.

, It will need to sit for at least 12 hours for the best results.Keep in mind that the longer you allow it to set, the more vibrant and red your hair will be. A dark, room temperature location is the best spot to store your henna.


If you’re in a hurry and don’t want to wait 12 hours to apply your henna, try to find a warm spot to set your henna. Letting it set somewhere that’s approximately 95 degrees can have your mixture ready in two hours., It can thicken up as it sets, so you may need to moisten the mixture.Slowly add more water or your chosen liquid until the henna is back to a smooth, mud-like consistency.

, Henna will stain anything that it comes into contact with, including your skin, so it’s important to make sure you’re covered. Applying petroleum jelly or another thick cream or balm along your hairline, ears, and necks will prevent the henna from staining your skin. Make sure to wear rubber, latex, or some other type of protective gloves while you’re applying the mixture to your hair.Wear clothes that you don’t mind getting stained when you apply the henna because drips or spills may happen, and you won’t be able to get the color out of your clothing.
It’s a good idea to apply your henna in the shower or bathtub, so you don’t have worry about getting it on your furniture, carpeting, or other surfaces.
If you do get henna on your skin, wipe it away immediately. The longer that it sits on your skin, the worse the stain will be. It can take several days for a henna to fade from the skin.

, Henna is thicker than other types of hair dye, so it can be difficult to ensure that you spread it all over your head.Working with individual sections of hair makes it easier to saturate all of it. Gather all of your hair and clip it up, leaving only a small section, approximately 1-inch wide, to start with.

, You want to really saturate the hair with the henna mixture, so don’t be afraid of applying too much.Take your time to ensure that you cover every strand with the henna too.


Do your best to avoid getting henna on the sections that you’re not working on at the moment. Henna can tangle your hair very easily, which may make it harder to work with the other sections later.
You can use a piping bag or squeeze bottle to apply the henna if you're having trouble controlling where it goes, but it's usually easier to use your fingers so you can really work it into your hair.For total coverage, apply the henna all the way up to your scalp. You may notice some slight staining, but it typically fades with a couple of hair washes.Because the thickness of henna can make it difficult to apply, you may want to ask a friend to help you color your hair, especially if you have long or extremely thick hair., Henna is more effective when it’s kept warm, so covering the mixture as it sits on your head helps your red color turn out more vibrant.Check the henna package instructions to see how long you should leave it on your hair. It can take anywhere from one to six hours, but the longer that you leave it on, the deeper your red will be.


Letting your henna sit on your hair for three to four hours will usually give you a nice, rich red color.
If your natural color is dark, you may want to leave the henna on for six hours to ensure that you get a noticeable red hue.

, You can remove it in the shower, but the henna may still stain your body as it’s washed away. Try rinsing it under the sink or tub faucet if you’re worried about the mess.Make sure that your gloves are on when you wash the henna out because it can still stain your hands too. You may need to rinse your hair a few times to get all of the henna out of your hair.


Start rinsing with straight water. If you’re having trouble getting all of the henna out of your hair, you can use a gentle shampoo to help remove the residue. Using a shampoo can also help get fade the earthy scent of henna that may last for several days in your hair.

, You can use a towel to dry off your hair, but don't blow dry it because the heat may dry out your locks.

, It’s normal for your hair to be a vivid orange or red right after you henna it. As it oxidizes, though, the color will deepen to a more natural shade of red. In fact, it can take up to three days for the true color to appear., You don’t want to dry your hair out in the first week or so after you’ve applied the henna. Avoid harsh, clarifying shampoos, and don’t use heated styling tools, such as curling irons and flat irons., Henna is permanent, so it's not going to wash out of your hair after you've shampooed it enough times. However, your roots will start to grow eventually, so you'll need to reapply when you notice them to keep the color consistent.Because henna is actually good for your hair, you can use it as often as you'd like. It will help condition and boost the shine.
When you're touching up your color, you can do a spot application and just apply the henna at the roots or cover all of your hair as a conditioning treatment.

Gather your henna and any desired additives.,
Pour the henna powder and liquids into a bowl.,
Mix until the henna's consistency resembles yogurt.,
Cover the henna bowl with plastic wrap.",How to Prepare Henna Hair Color2," Besides your henna, you can also combine additives for different effects. If you dislike the smell of henna, you can add essential oils or rosewater for a pleasant scent and better setting dye.For smoother henna, add sugar.Lemon juice or vinegar can create brighter colors.If you do not want to change the color or properties of the henna, just add water with a dash of lemon to oxidize the dye.

, Pour the henna into a bowl and gradually incorporate the liquid. How much liquid you need will depend on the henna box you purchased. Add a little at a time to avoid making your henna too watery.

Consult the henna packaging for specifics on how much liquid to add.
Henna is messy and will stain most surfaces. Wear gloves while you mix the henna, and wipe it immediately off of anything it spills on.

, Continue mixing the henna and slowly adding liquids until your henna meets the right consistency. When your henna is finished mixing, it should be somewhere between the consistency of cake batter and yogurt., After you have mixed the henna and found an ideal consistency, wrap the henna bowl tightly in plastic wrap. Wrapping your bowl will allow your henna to set and oxidize. Your henna will now need to undergo dye release, where it will darken in color"
"
Let the henna paste sit overnight.,
Check for dye release.,
Test the color before you dye your hair.,
Use your henna within three to four days.",How to Prepare Henna Hair Color3," Let the bowl sit in room temperature as it releases the dye. Make certain that the plastic wrap is tightly covered to quicken the process. If you do not have time to wait overnight, put the henna in a closed pot over a stove for 1-2 hours. Take the temperature of the henna and make sure it's around 90°F (or 32°C). Any hotter, and your henna may not have ideal consistency.If you are using indigo henna dye, use it after mixing. Indigo henna has a shorter oxidation time.
Dye release will occur best in room temperature. Do not place the henna in the refrigerator or freezer until after it has exhibited dye release.

, You will be able to spot dye release by the surface. Your henna should be a dark brown color (or black, if using indigo dye) and have liquid pooling at the top. You can check the surface by pulling back the top layer with a spoon. If the top layer is darker than the bottom, your henna is ready to use.

To test for dye release, put your paste in a plastic baggie. Put the baggie on top of a white paper towel. Dye molecules are small enough that they will slip through the plastic. If your paper towel turns slightly orange after a few minutes, your henna is exhibiting dye release., Before you apply the mixture to your hair, put a small amount of henna paste on a spoon. Remove some of your hair from your hairbrush, and let the henna sit on the hair for several hours. After the henna has dyed the hair sample, decide whether the color is ideal for you. If not, prepare a new mixture., Unless you are using indigo henna (which lasts for a shorter amount of time), your henna will last in the refrigerator for three or four days. If you need it to last longer, you can freeze it. Frozen henna can last up to several months with the same freshness as newly-mixed henna.Keep the henna covered with plastic wrap while in the fridge or freezer to avoid drying your henna out.

Some henna comes already mixed with additives. If you have purchased a henna that describes a particular color, you may not want to experiment with adding to the mix unless you are an experienced henna user. The additions described here are intended to be added to pure henna powder.
Henna out of the box should be green to brown, and smell like dried plants or grass clippings. Do not buy any henna that is purple or black, or that has a chemical smell.
If you have severe allergies or sensitive skin, do a patch test before using. Apply a small bit of the henna mixture to your skin, wait a couple hours, and watch to see how your skin reacts.;
, This is not a precise science. There are a huge number of variables, and you may not get exactly what you wanted the first time around. Results will vary, and your hair may dye unevenly. If you are a perfectionist about your hair, this process is probably not for you.Pure henna can only achieve shades of red. If a product called ""henna"" purports to dye your hair black, it contains indigo. Some henna mixes can give you a blonde color, but it will always be a reddish blonde.
Rather than obscuring your natural hair color, henna blends with it. This is important to remember when mixing a color. Aim for a color you want to combine with your natural one, not the color you want to achieve. Keep in mind that very light colored hair will probably need to be dyed multiple times to become dark.
Because grey hair is translucent, it creates a cleaner canvas for henna. This means the mixing effect that happens with non-grey hair will not take place, and your color will be much closer to the color created by the dye. It also means it is easier to dye your hair unevenly, as hair with more dye on it will become noticeably darker., There is a vast array of ingredients you can combine with pure henna powder to create different effects. The list is longer than can be contained in one article, but here are a few to consider.For a bright strawberry blonde, use lemon juice, vinegar, or red wine.
For an intensified red, use brandy.
For a less intense, browner red, use coffee or black tea.
If you dislike the smell of henna, you can add good smelling things like essential oils, rosewater, or cloves.
You do not need to add anything to change the color of pure henna. Water will work fine as well, although you should add a dash of lemon, orange, or grapefruit juice to oxidize the dye. If this is your first time using henna, you may want to see how it combines with your hair on its own, so that in the future you can decide what, if anything, you want to add.

, This is a pretty straightforward process. Pour the powder into a bowl. Gradually incorporate liquid, and stir.









Use a ceramic, plastic, glass, or stainless steel bowl.
There is no way to tell precisely what amount of liquid you will need. Add it a little bit at a time, stirring until the mixture is the gloopy consistency of yogurt.This will be a messy mixture, and it will stain any surface it gets on. It may be a good idea to wear gloves, and you should immediately wipe the mixture off of anything you accidentally smear it on.

, Cover it with plastic wrap and wait at least a couple hours, or overnight for best results. You will know it's ready when the henna darkens from green to dark brown. This means the dye has oxidized and is ready to be used.








, Your body’s natural oils will help the dye. It is ok to shower—the water won’t remove the oils from your scalp on its own—but skip the shampoo., Have everything you need within easy reach, so you don’t have to get up to get something mid-dyeing process. You should have a garbage bag, some petroleum jelly, the henna mixture you prepared, a towel you don’t mind getting messy, and a pair of plastic gloves., This is basically a full-body bib. Put it on. Alternatively, you can wear old clothes, or use an old towel., If this grosses you out you can skip it, but you may wind up accidentally dying some of your skin. The idea is to apply it along the parts of your skin that are next to the edges of your hair: along your hairline, your ears, etc.







, Make sure you put your gloves on first. The most crucial thing here is to coat your hair evenly with the henna mixture.









Pay special attention to the ends and the roots, particularly along your hairline.
Err on the side of using too much.
When your hair is evenly coated, pile it on top of your head, and wrap your hair securely in a towel.
Wipe off any excess henna with a wet washcloth., For best results, leave it in overnight; you may want to cover your pillow with a garbage bag, or something you don’t mind getting dirty.









If you don’t want to sleep with the dye in your hair, you can simply leave it in for a few hours. The longer you leave it in, however, the more intense the effect will be.The greater change you want to effect, the longer you will need to leave the dye in.
It is easier to darken light hair than it is to lighten dark hair. If you have very dark hair to begin with, even leaving henna in overnight won’t make you a strawberry blond.

, You will want to wear gloves for this as well, or your hands will be stained orange. Be very careful; it is easy to dye things you don’t want dyed. Depending on the length of your hair, this part of the process can take anywhere from 5 minutes to an hour.


Kneel over the bathtub rather than standing in it, or you will dye your whole body.Carefully remove the wrap covering your hair.
Rinse thoroughly, until the water runs clear.
Get into the shower. Apply shampoo, and rinse.
Apply a deep conditioner and let it sit for 10 or 15 minutes before rinsing.

, Go check out your new hair color in a mirror! Don’t wash it or get it wet for another 24 - 48 hours.

Mix ½ cup (50 g) of henna with ¼ cup (59 ml) of warm water. Stir to combine. Stir in more water by the tablespoon (15 ml) as necessary, until the henna paste becomes the consistency of mashed potatoes.


Once you’ve mixed the powder and water, cover the bowl with plastic and let it develop at room temperature for about 12 hours.
When you're ready to apply the dye, mix in a bit more water until you have a thick but spreadable consistency.;
, Before applying henna, you'll want to start with clean hair. In the shower or bath, wash your hair with your regular shampoo to remove dirt, oil, and styling products. Rinse the shampoo well. Once out of the shower, towel dry, blow dry, or air dry your hair.


Do not condition your hair, as the oils in the conditioner can prevent the henna from penetrating your roots properly., If you have long hair, gather it up and tie it back so it’s out of your face and off your shoulders and neck. For short hair, put on a headband to keep your hair out of your face. With your fingers, apply some coconut oil, body butter, or petroleum jelly to your hairline, including your forehead, neck, and ears.The oil will create a barrier between the henna and your skin, so this will prevent stains around your hairline.

, Let your hair down and comb it with a wide-toothed comb. This will remove tangles and knots without making your hair frizzy. Part your hair in the center, and let your hair fall evenly to either side of your head.You don’t have to section off your hair, because you'll be dyeing it in layers.

, Henna tends to get everywhere, so it’s a good idea to wear old clothes and to protect yourself with a rag or old towel. Drape the towel over your shoulders. Arrange the towel to cover your neck and shoulders, and use a pin or hair clip to keep it together.Because henna can stain the skin, put on a pair of rubber or latex gloves to protect your hands and nails.


You can also use a plastic sheet, poncho, or a cutting cape.
Keep a damp rag nearby to wipe drips off your skin immediately.

, Starting with the topmost layer of hair, grab a thin 2-inch-wide (5-cm-wide) section of hair from the middle back of your head. Comb this section away from the rest of your hair. With a large tint brush or your fingers, apply 1 to 2 teaspoons (2 to 4 g) of henna to the roots of your hair. Spread the henna toward the tips, adding more paste if necessary.Henna paste doesn’t spread as easily as conventional dye, so it’s important to ensure that your hair is fully saturated from root to tip.

, When you’ve fully covered the first section of hair, twist it a few times and then wrap it into a bun on top of your head. The henna paste is quite sticky, so the coil of hair will just sit there.You can pin it in place if you like.


For short hair, twist the section and pin it on top of your head to keep it out of the way.

, Working with the same topmost layer of hair, take a fresh 2-inch (5-cm) section of hair from beside the original section. Apply henna paste to the roots with your fingers or a tint brush. Work the paste toward the tip, adding more paste if necessary, until the entire section is saturated with henna paste.

, Twist the dyed section of hair a few times. Wrap it around the original bun that you created with the first section of hair. Because the henna is so sticky, the coil will stay, but you can pin it in place.


For short hair, twist the section, place it on top of the original section, and pin it in place.

, Work in small sections, like before. Work toward the front of your head, applying henna to the hair on both sides of the part. Continue working in thin 2-inch (5-cm) sections to ensure proper coverage. When you’ve dyed the topmost layer of hair, repeat the same process with the layer below until all your hair has been dyed.


Keep twisting and wrapping each section of hair around the original bun., When every section of hair has been covered and twisted into the bun, go around your hairline and add more paste to areas where the henna looks sparse or more coverage is needed. Pay particular attention to the hairline line and roots., When your hair is fully covered, take a long sheet of plastic wrap and wrap your hair. Wrap the plastic all the way around your hairline and completely cover your hair and the top of your head. Don’t cover your ears.


Wrapping your hair in plastic will help keep the henna warm and moist, and this will allow it to set.If you have to go out while your hair is like this, you can wrap a scarf around the plastic wrap to cover it.

, Henna generally takes between two and four hours to set. The longer you leave it on, the deeper and more vibrant the color will be. You can encourage color development by keeping the henna warm. Stay inside if it’s cold out, or wear a hat if you must go out.


You can leave the henna on for as long as six hours if you want to achieve maximum vibrancy., When the henna has had enough time to set, put your gloves back on and remove the plastic wrap. Hop in the shower and thoroughly rinse the henna paste from your hair. Rub conditioner into your hair to help loosen the paste.Continue conditioning and rinsing until the water runs clear and there's no paste left in your hair.

, Henna takes about 48 hours to develop properly. When your hair first dries, it will look very bright and orange. Over the next couple of days, the color will deepen and become less orange., Henna is a permanent dye, so you don’t have to worry about the color washing out or fading over time. You can reapply to achieve a deeper and more vibrant color, or just apply more paste to your roots as they grow out.When touching up roots, leave the henna on for the same amount of time as the original application to achieve a similar color.

Heat up the flat iron.,
Make sure your hair is completely dry.,
Apply a heat protection spray.,
Split your hair into sections.,
Start curling.,
Loosen your curls (optional).,
Set your curls with hairspray (optional).",How to Curl Hair2," Most flat irons will need a little time to heat up before you can use them. If you try to curl your hair with the iron before it reaches the correct temperature, the curls will not hold.


Some flat irons will have different settings which you can play around with until you achieve the best result. Try to keep it at the lowest temperature possible though, to cause less damage to your hair.
A good guide is 320ºF (160ºC) for fine hair and 430ºF (220ºC) for thicker hair.
The width of the flat iron is also important when it comes to curling your hair. You need to use a flat iron that is narrow (about 1-2 inches, or 2.5-5 cm, in width), with rounded edges. A flat, paddle-style flat iron will not work for curls.

, Putting a hot iron on damp hair can seriously damage it — not because the iron is too hot, but because the water will turn to scalding steam. Play it safe, and completely dry your hair first. Run a blowdryer over any damp spots.


You can add a little volumizing mousse to your hair before drying, which will help give you bouncy curls and prevent your hair from looking flat once styled.
Brush out any tangles while the iron heats up. Start at the end of your hair and brush out the bottom few inches, then work your way up until you can easily brush through the length of your hair.

, If you regularly use heat to style your hair, it's really important that you use a heat protection spray. It will protect your hair from the damage caused by exposure to high temperatures and prevent it from becoming dry and frazzled looking. Just spray it liberally all over your hair before curling.


Heat protector sprays can be found at most drug stores and hair salons.

, Even if you have thin hair, you'll get better results if you work with small sections of hair. That way, you can make sure you're curling everything and curl in a more uniform style.


Pin or clip up the top section of your hair. Using your thumbs, grab everything that's above the top of your ears and clip it up on top of your head.
Release layers as you work. When the bottom layer of hair is finished, unclip your hair and let out a little more, clipping up the excess again. Continue working this way until all your hair is curled.

, Now that all the prep work is out of the way, you're ready to start curling. Grab the piece of hair you wish to curl and give it a quick brush through to remove any remaining tangles. Clamp the flat iron around the hair and give it a half turn so that your hair is in a U-shape. Hold the flat iron in this position as you move it down the hair shaft, right to the ends.









The position of the flat iron will determine what kind of curls you end up with. If you want your hair curled from the root to tip, position the flat iron as close to your scalp as possible, without burning it.
If you just want to curl just the ends of your hair, position the flat iron about halfway down the hair to begin. This is called a flick.
The slower you move the iron, the tighter the curls will be. If you move the iron down the hair too quickly, your curls will be soft and loose.
Remember that using bigger sections of hair (more than two inches wide) will result in bigger, looser curls, while using smaller sections of hair (less than two inches) will give you smaller, tighter ringlets.

, If you want your hair to look softer and looser, run your fingers through the curls a few times. The curls will pull down and loosen up as you do so. You can also turn your head upside down and use your fingers to fluff up and separate the curls.


Wait until your hair has cooled completely before attempting to loosen the curls.
Once you have curled your hair, do not brush it with a hairbrush. It will loosen the curls too much and they will fall out.
If you brush out curls with a hairbrush, your hair will look wavy rather that curly, which can be a nice style in itself.

, If you tend to have straight hair, or you're worried about your curls turning frizzy or falling out throughout the day, mist some hairspray over your curls. If you want tight curls, you can spray each curl individually as soon as you've finished with it, but if you want a looser style, wait until the curls have relaxed a little and only spray them when you've finished curling your entire head.


Choose a loose hold hairspray so your curls aren't too stiff and you hair doesn't feel too ""crunchy"". Hold the can about 12-14 in (30.5 cm - 35.5 cm) away from your head and spray evenly around your head. Be careful not to apply too much.
Never apply hairspray to your hair before you curl it, as some styling guides recommend. The combination of the heat from the irons and the alcohol in the hairspray will fry your hair.

Choose the hair rollers.,
Figure out if your hair needs to be wet or dry.,
Apply product.,
Section your hair.,
Use the right amount of hair for each roller.,
Wrap your hair around the roller.,
Secure the rollers.,
Leave your hair to set.,
Remove the rollers.,
Set your curls with hairspray (optional).",How to Curl Hair3," Hair rollers come in many different types, shapes and sizes. Try to choose a set of rollers that work best for your hair type and also for the type of curls you are trying to achieve.


Hot rollers are very efficient and will curl hair more quickly, but they are more damaging to your hair. Velcro rollers and foam rollers are very easy to use, but your curls will take a little longer to set.Velcro rollers are also a great option for hair that is naturally smooth as they are less likely to get tangled in your hair.
Small curlers will give you lots of tight curls, whereas large rollers will give you big loose waves and are great for adding volume.

, Depending on the type of rollers, your hair may need to be wet or dry when putting them in. Hot rollers should always be applied to dry hair, as they would cause too much damage otherwise. Velcro rollers are also usually applied to dry hair, whereas special wet set rollers are used if you want to put them in while wet.


If you are applying rollers to dry hair, try to wash your hair the day before you curl. Day-old hair will curl much better than freshly washed hair.If your hair is particularly resistant to curling, try skipping the conditioner after shampooing. This will make sure your hair isn't too soft for the roller to get a good grip on the hair.If you are doing a wet set, be aware that you will have to wait for your hair to be completely dry before removing the rollers, which may take a long time. Consider putting the rollers in wet hair before bed and sleeping with them in overnight.

, Using a little product can go a long way when using hair rollers. Again, which type of product you use will depend on what type of rollers you use and whether your hair is wet or dry.


If you're using hot rollers, you should use a heat protection product like a mist or dry oil, to prevent your hair from being damaged. A setting product will also help curls to hold their shape.If you're using velcro or foam rollers, you should use a setting product along with some volumizing hairspray to prevent your curls from falling flat.If you're doing a wet set, a smoothing cream or serum can really help to minimize frizz., You should divide your hair into separate sections using hair ties or claw clips. The sizes of these sections will vary depending on the size of your rollers. Each section should be about the same width as the rollers you plan to use.


Create a central “mohawk” section along the top and back of your head.
Section off 3-4 vertical rows along the sides of your head.
Release sections as you work. When the bottom section of hair is finished, unclip your hair and let out the next section. Continue working this way until all the rollers are in.

, Resist the urge to grab sections that are too large for the curlers — you'll end up with nothing but a small curl at the bottom. A one- or two-inch section (2.5 to 5 cm) per roller is a good standard to follow. The section of hair should be no wider than the roller, otherwise hair will not curl properly.If your rollers have variable sizes, use the larger ones on the top of your head. Use the smaller rollers as you approach your hairline.
If you have long hair, remember that not only the bottom part of the section will actually be touching the roller — the rest of it will be layered over hair. Use smaller sections for more curl.

, Starting at the bottom, hold the tip of your hair firmly against the roller with a finger, then roll the roller up along the hair, smoothly and tightly. Tension is the key to creating a good curl, so make sure the hair is wrapped securely around the roller.








You should also make sure there are no lumps or bumps in your hair as you wrap it around the curler, in order to create smooth, consistent curls.
If you're using hot rollers, be careful not to burn your fingers on the ends of the roller. Try to find a cool spot where you can consistently grip the roller as you put it into your hair.

, While velcro rollers will attach themselves to your hair without the need for clips, other rollers will need to be pinned into place. Some roller sets will come with pins provided. These pins probably look like long U shapes, with one straight side and one crimped side. Pin the roller so that the straight side is against your scalp, and the curve of the U is cradling the roller at the side of your head.


Be aware that these pins aren't terribly secure. If you move your head too quickly or suddenly, they might fall loose.
If no pins are provided with your set, similar pins can be purchased at a drugstore. Alternatively, butterfly clips will also work to hold the hair in place.
If you want to avoid an indentation from the clip on your hair, try placing a tissue in between the pin and the hair., Once all of the rollers have been inserted - in one to two inch sections from the base of your scalp to the crown of your head - you will need to leave the rollers to set. How long this takes will again depend on the type of roller and whether your hair is wet or dry.


Hot rollers can be removed once they have cooled completely - which usually takes about 10 to 15 minutes. This is enough time for the heat to penetrate all of the hair wrapped around each individual roller, as well as for the hair to cool into a curled shape.Velcro or foam rollers should be blasted with some heat from a hair dryer, then allowed to cool and set for about 15-20 minutes. The longer you leave them in, the tighter the curls will be.Wet set rollers will need to be left in until all of your hair is completely dry, which may take several hours or overnight. The dampest parts of the hair are the ends that are tucked inside the curls, so attempting to speed up the process with a hair dryer is unlikely to work.

, Once you're sure your hair has set, you can pull out the rollers from bottom to top. Remove the rollers near your neck and ears first, then move incrementally to the ones at the top of your head.


Once the rollers are out, you can brush out the curls to loosen them. Just don't overdo it, your curls should keep their shape for two or three strokes, but overdoing it might cause them to fall out.
Alternatively, you can just run your fingers through the curls to separate them and add a some volume.

, Mist hairspray over your hair to make sure the curl hold their shape throughout the day. To avoid your curls from looking stiff, make sure to hold the can 12-14 inches away from the hair.


For a looser look, pull up a section of hair and mist it with hairspray as it falls back down.
You can also work a small amount of serum into your hair to add shine and reduce frizz.

Seek professional medical help if you experience side effects.,
Report adverse reactions to the Food and Drug Administration.",How to Be Safe when Using Henna2," Some manufacturers produce inks marketed as “black henna” that might be a mix of traditional henna and additional ingredients. Many, however, mix henna with coal tar hair dye that contains p-phenylenediamine, or PPD. PPD is not intended to be applied to human skin. It is not permitted to be used in cosmetics for skin in the U.S., as it can cause dangerous skin reactions.While inks marketed as “black henna” create tattoos that are darker and last longer than those created with traditional henna, these dyes are harmful and should be avoided.

, Red henna is generally safe when applied to the skin. Staining the skin reddish-brown, traditional henna can be safely used for body art. Red henna does, however, carry the risk of rare instances of reactions ranging from contact allergy to hypersensitivity., Before using henna to dye your hair or create body art, make sure you conduct a patch test. Apply a very small amount of the henna to a tiny patch or skin or swath or hair. Wait at least fifteen minutes before removing. If you experience any adverse side effects, such as redness or irritation, you should not use henna on your skin or hair.

, When applying a traditional henna to your skin or hair, be sure to wear gloves. This will prevent the dye from making its way to unwanted places and help create a sanitary application process.

, Department and specialty stores often sell kits that contain supplies for creating henna tattoos at home. These can contain caustic chemicals that are unsafe for use on human skin, such as kerosene, metal salts, benzene, lead, and artificial dyes, and should be avoided., If you do make the decision to get a henna tattoo, you should seek out a reliable professional with experience. Seek out a professional who has a good reputation in your community, has been practicing the art for an extended period of time, and who uses pure henna. Be sure to ask for a full disclosure of ingredients in the henna they will use for your tattoo.

, If you experience any side effects from a henna tattoo or hair dye, please seek medical attention immediately. While side effects from red henna are rare, they can still occur and necessitate a visit to your medical provider. Reactions to “black henna” tattoos are more common, with as many as 2.5% of people experiencing a contact allergy to p-phenylenediamine, or PPD., MedWatch, the Food and Drug Administration’s problem-reporting program, can be reached by calling 1-800-332-1088.

Avoid using coconut oil to treat dandruff.",How to Use Coconut Oil for Your Hair," Any coconut oil will work, whether it's labeled for hair or cooking. There are many types, however, so use this guide to find a quality oil:A *""virgin,"" ""extra-virgin,"" or ""unrefined"" label means the coconut oil has no added chemicals. A high quality virgin coconut oil should be pure white when solid, and clear when liquid.
A ""refined"" or unlabeled product has probably gone through an industrial process. There are high- and low-quality examples, but they are difficult to evaluate without researching the brand. These tend to have a more mild scent.;
, Either type of oil can be extracted from the coconut in one of several ways. This is a little technical, and you can skip it without much harm done. For those interested in finding the perfect brand, here's a breakdown:


""Centrifuged"" oils tend to have a more mild scent, and little risk of damage.
""Expeller-pressed"" or ""cold-pressed"" oils range from mild to strong scented. Low-quality examples may have heat damage, which cause unpleasant burnt scents.
""Direct Micro Expelled"" (DME) oil tends to be high-quality, and created directly by coconut farmers. This may be difficult to find.

, Virgin coconut oil melts at 76ºF (24ºC), so in temperate weather it may already melt as you apply it to your hair.If you prefer handling liquid oil, spoon about 2–3 tablespoons (30–45mL) coconut oil into a bowl. Place the bowl in a larger container and pour hot tap water into the larger container, until it reaches halfway up the bowl. The oil should turn liquid within a few minutes.


Do not microwave the oil. While this probably won't make it less effective, it can make the oil dangerously hot., Knots and tangles will make applying the oil more difficult., As a pre-wash conditioner, coconut oil reduces hygral fatigue, or swollen, damaged hair caused by water exposure. It may also reduce damage caused by brushing and heat-treating wet hair.Massage a small amount of coconut oil onto the roots of your hair, and drag it down throughout all your hair. Make sure you use an old towel and no clothes as coconut oil stains clothes and towels. Leave the oil in for 10–20 minutes first to treat damaged hair as well. Keep it under a shower cap or plastic bag to prevent dripping and keep it warm. Wash and condition your hair as usual.


Although your hair will be more resistant to damage, it won't be invulnerable. When convenient, avoid brushing and heat-drying wet hair to reduce damage.

, As a leave-in conditioner, coconut oil reduces damage caused by brushing or handling wet hair, and adds shine.Start with a pea-sized amount, and saturate the ends. Work your way up, adding a light layer to the middle and nothing at all to the roots.Add a little more if necessary, but not so much that your hair feels greasy. Leave this in as long as you like.


This technique will restore some strength to chemically treated hair, heat-damaged hair, and dry Afro-textured hair.If you have frizzy hair, this will tame your curls in the short term. However, since coconut oil penetrates the hair, your hair will frizz again over time. Mineral oil is more effective for this purpose, although it will not restore strength., A heavy application of coconut oil can restore strength and shine to dry, damaged hair. About once a week or whenever convenient, set aside some time for a big treatment. To start out, rub in the oil with your fingers, or dip a pastry brush into liquid oil. Massage it over all of your hair, focusing on dry or damaged areas.


If you have thick or long hair, section it first and apply the oil in sections.

, After a heavy application, tie your hair up and keep it under a shower cap, plastic bag, or plastic wrap.

, Optionally, use a thermal cap or a steamer for 10–30 minutes to increase absorption.You may also need a plastic cap to prevent burning and heat damage.

, Coconut oil might be the best oil ever at soaking into your hair. After just one hour, your hair can absorb about 15% of its weight in oil. If you have severely damaged hair, leave the oil in for six hours to increase this to about 25%., After you're finished with the heavy application, wash your hair twice and use conditioner to remove all the oil from your scalp and hair. The absorbed coconut oil will remain inside the hair shaft, protecting it from further damage.

, Rubbing in coconut oil can be highly effective at fighting certain types of scalp infections, called dermatophytes.Symptoms include a swollen scalp, abscesses on the scalp, or hair loss that leaves black dots of broken hair on the scalp.Always talk to a doctor first when dealing with a serious medical problem. Talk to a doctor first if you already apply medication to your scalp.

, If you have head lice and prescription treatment (permethrin) has failed to get rid of them, a spray of coconut and anise may do the trick.As always, a conversation with your doctor is a good first step.

, Although some people use coconut oil for dandruff, this is generally a bad idea. Dandruff is usually caused by fungus that feeds on your scalp's natural oils. Adding more natural oil may just increase the food supply.Try a mineral oil instead, or other treatments.

When you shampoo your hair, you wash away these oils, leaving your hair dry. Everyone loves a clean head of hair, simply rinse your hair in the shower and alternate days for shampooing.


If you'd like, you can try using a dry shampoo like Batiste Dry Shampoo Original,between washes.;
, Every time you wash your hair, use a moisturizing shampoo or conditioner. Moisturizing shampoos and conditioners have specific ingredients that help smooth hair. Use plenty of conditioner.


Squeeze extra conditioner into your hair, working your way from root to tip.
Leave your conditioner in for at least two minutes before rinsing.
If you have very fine hair, apply conditioner only from the mid-shafts to the ends to prevent flatness.
Avoid shampoos that advertise increased hair volume, these will exacerbate frizz.
Products that contain silicone (especially dimethicone)help lock out humidity and keep your hair smooth.

, Cold water seals the hair cuticle, which will prevent each strand from losing valuable moisture and create a sleeker shinier look. Enjoy a warm shower and douse your hair in cool or cold water before getting out. Avoiding wringing or squeezing your hair.








, Terrycloth towels are rough on the cuticles and can contribute to frizz. Try gently pressing the water from your hair with a t-shirt or microfiber towel. Remember to never wring or rub your hair aggressively.








, The faster your hair dries, the quicker your cuticles will lay down. Use a blow dryer and make sure your hair is completely dry. Any residual moisture can lead to poofy hair later. Use cool or warm air to try your hair.









Dryers work to reduce frizz by compressing the cuticle. A good recommendation for a hairdryer is the Conair Comfort Touch Tourmaline Ceramic Styling Blow Dryer,or any modern hairdryer.

, If you shower at night anyway or don't want to use a blow dryer, try combing out your hair and braiding it into a tight side braid. Don't make it so tight that it bothers you and let it dry a bit so it's not soaking wet.Let your hair dry overnight in the braid and take it out in the morning. This might help you control unwanted poof.








, A hot oil treatment is a great way to condition and strengthen your hair. This is a good idea for all hair types, so try it out with your friends. Choose a treatment with jojoba oil, such as Queen Helene Jojoba Hot Oil Treatment, to help strengthen the cuticle and further prevent frizz. Just be sure to apply it below your ears only so the crown doesn't get too flat.

, With so many styling products available, there are plenty of options to help enhance your natural curl while fighting off unwanted frizz.


Products like gels, mousses, and curl-enhancing creams all contain ingredients called polymers (usually listed as PVP Copolymer on the label). Polymers coat the hair and “lock” your curl or wave into place.
If your hair is fine and wavy then mousses are your best choice since they don’t weight hair down.
If your hair is coarse and curly, gel or cream is recommended.

, If your hair is damaged from dye, or just naturally dry, a boar-bristle brushcan help to reduce frizz. This type of brush helps to gather the natural oils from your scalp and distribute them throughout your hair.

, It may seem counterintuitive, but wrapping flyaway strands around a curling iron can help set them in place and smooth out your hair. Be sure to completely dry your hair first and use the curling iron sparingly. Keep it on a low heat and don't hold the strands for very long.









Whenever using heat, you risk causing damage to your hair. Always use a heat protecting spray like TRESemmé Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Spray.), Most hair sprays and mousses have a high alcohol content, which can cause the cuticle to swell up. Try using products that work to reduce frizz.









For a mousse that is alcohol-free, try Leonor Greyl Mousse au Lotus Volumatrice.Use a wide-toothed comb to distribute a silicone serum evenly throughout your hair and dry before styling.

Wash and condition your hair.,
Towel dry your hair.,
Comb your hair.,
Apply product.,
Scrunch your hair.,
Dry hair.",How to Curl Hair4," Scrunching only works properly on wet hair, so in order to use this method, you will need to wash your hair. While taking a warm shower, work your hair into a thick lather, using a volumizing or curl-enhancing shampoo. Then work a small amount of conditioner into the ends and mid-lengths of your hair.


After you apply conditioner, brush your hair with a wide-toothed comb and try to get out all the major knots. The conditioner will make the tangles a lot easier to tackle and will prevent you from causing damage to your hair.
Make sure to rinse your hair thoroughly afterwards, as excess product can weigh down hair and prevent it from curling as well.

, Once you get out of the shower, use an absorbent towel to pat your hair dry and squeeze the ends to get excess water out. If your hair is too wet, any product you apply will drip out along with the water and your hair will not curl as well.


Do not rub your hair with the towel as this will damage your hair and cause it to look frizzy.
You should also avoid using a hair dryer to get rid of excess moisture, as the hair dryer will blow and straighten the hair, making curling more difficult.

, Use a wide-toothed comb to get the smaller knots out of your hair. Make sure no knots are left in your hair, or else they will show once your hair is dry! If you brushed your hair in the shower, there should be no major knots left, so just brush out the small ones.


Use a detangling mist or spray if you have particularly stubborn knots.
Always brush or comb from the ends of your hair up as this causes less damage to wet hair.

, There are many different curling products available which you can use to scrunch your hair, such as curling sprays, gels and creams. However, the most popular product which probably provides the most defined and long-lasting curls is curling mousse. Choose a volumizing or strong-hold mousse, particularly if your hair is not naturally wavy, as this will help to give you long-lasting, voluminous curls.


To use the mousse, shake the can before squirting a golf ball size amount of mousse into your hand. Turn your head upside down so your hair is in front of your face, then work the product evenly into your hair with both hands.
Only work the mousse into the ends and mid-lengths of your hair - avoid putting it in the roots as this may weigh your hair down or cause it to look greasy.

, Keeping your head upside down, scrunch your hair by grabbing a small section in your hand and crumpling it up towards your scalp, using the same motion as you would use to crumple a piece of paper.









Use this motion to scrunch sections of hair all over your head. Keep doing it for a minute or two, then flip your head up and scrunch again until you're happy with the style.
The same technique can be used regardless of what kind of curling product you use, just adjust the amount of product according to the instructions on the bottle and the length of your hair - more for longer hair, less for shorter hair.

, At this point you have two options. You can let your hair air dry naturally, using the scrunching motion every five minutes or so until it's dry. Or, you can use a diffuser attachment on your hair dryer to dry hair gently, without blowing or straightening the curls.


If you're using the diffuser attachment (a long-finger diffuser works best for curls) be sure to set the hair dryer to its lowest heat and speed setting. Use the scrunching method as you dry to help the formation of curls.
If your hair is naturally curly or wavy, the air dry method will usually work just fine. However, if your hair is naturally straight or flat, using the diffuser will help give your hair a little extra ""oomph!""

Wash and condition your hair.,
Apply gel or mousse to your hair.,
Decide how many braids you'll do.,
Part your hair into sections.,
Use a normal braid or a french braid on each section.,
Secure the braids.,
Leave the braids in for several hours or overnight.",How to Curl Hair5," This method works best if you braid your hair while it's wet or damp, then leave your hair to dry. Use a volumizing or curl-enhancing shampoo and conditioner, and make sure to rinse your hair well afterwards.


Brush out your hair in the shower while you still have the conditioner in, using a wide-toothed comb. This will make it easier to work out any tangles and will cause less damage to your hair.
Towel dry your hair once you get out of the shower. Try to wring out any excess moisture. If your hair already has a bit of natural curl to it, you're probably fine to work with damp hair; if it's stick straight, though, it's best to braid it wet.

, Applying a curl-enhancing product to your hair will help it to keep the shape of the braids even after you've unbraided it. It will also give your hair a glossier and more controlled finish. Just work a small amount of your chosen product into the ends and mid-lengths of your hair, avoiding the roots.


Curl-enhancing or volumizing gels, mousses, sprays or serums will all work well. Use a product with a texture and scent that appeals to you.
If you want looser, less structured curls, you can skip this step.

, The number of braids you put in your hair will determine how your curls look:


More braids means tighter curls. For instance, you'll have more crimps in your hair from doing two braids than you will from one, and more from four than two.
However, more braids means more work. If you're not totally comfortable braiding or you're short on time, stick to the lowest possible number that gives you the curls you want.

, If you're doing more than one braid, parting your hair into sections will make braiding easier and your finished curls neater looking. They don't have to be perfect, though!


Use a comb to part a straight line from your forehead back to your neck. Then divide each half into however many sections you like, using the comb to ensure they are a fairly uniform size.

, Doing a French braid, instead of a regular braid, will curl the hair up around your scalp as well.









See How to French Braid for more detailed help.
Ask someone else to help you. It's almost always easier to braid someone else's hair than it is to do your own, so consider asking for assistance.

, Tie off each braid with a non-rubber hair elastic. Try to put the tie as close to the end of the hair as possible, otherwise the tips of your hair will look straight and it will ruin the effect of the curls.









Rubber can damage the hair shaft, and is especially menacing on wet hair. Avoid at all costs!

, After your hair's had six to eight hours to dry, gently undo your braids. The easiest thing to do is to leave them in overnight. Run your fingers through your hair a few times to get out any knots, but avoid brushing it as this will make to too fluffy looking.


Finish with some hairspray. If you're worried about your curls falling out during the day, set the style with a spritz of hairspray.

Twist your hair into buns.,
Twist your hair around a headband.,
Twist your hair in sections to create waves.",How to Curl Hair6," You can create, big, soft “beach curls” without heat or rollers by twisting your hair and putting it into buns. For this method, you will need hair ties, hair spray, and bobby pins.Start with damp hair. You can either spritz your hair with a spray bottle, or let it partially air dry after you wash it.
Use hair ties to divide your hair into four roughly equal sections: two low ponytails at the back, and two pigtails higher up on the sides of your head.
Tightly twist each section in whichever direction you prefer. Twisting the sections in different directions from each other will create a more natural effect.
Coil each twisted section into a tight bun, and pin it in place with bobby pins.
Blow dry each bun until completely dry, or allow the hair to air dry completely.
Release each section, and gently loosen the curls with your fingers once your hair is completely cool.
Use a little hair spray to lock in the style.

, You can create ringlets or waves by twisting your hair around a soft, cloth headband. For this technique, you will need one or two headbands, a spray bottle for water, hair spray, and a hair texturizer.Part your hair into two sections on either side of your head, then gently place the headband around the top of your head. Slide it down so that it rests just above your ears.
Dampen each section of hair slightly with a spray bottle, starting at the tops of your ears.
Begin twisting the hair on one side. Once you’ve twisted a little bit of hair, wrap the twisted portion around the headband. Make the first wrap just behind your ear. Twist a little more, then create another wrap next to the first.
Continue until you have wrapped the entire section around the headband. Then repeat with the other section. The smaller you make each wrap, the tighter your curls will be.
Spray your hair with hairspray while it is still wrapped around the headband.
Allow the hair to air dry for a few hours, or dry with a blow dryer.
Once your hair is dry, release the twisted sections from the headband. Loosen your curls with your fingers, and scrunch with a small amount of hair texturizer.

, The simplest approach to creating twist curls involves making a few twisted sections and tying them together with elastic hair ties.Apply a little hair spray or other styling product to your slightly damp hair.
Part your hair down the middle and divide it into four sections: two behind your ears, and two in front of your ears.
Take hold of the ends of the two back sections and twist them toward each other until the entire length of both sections is twisted. Then fasten the twisted sections together with a hair elastic.
Repeat with the two front sections. Fasten the sections together behind your head with a hair elastic once you are finished twisting them.
Once your hair is completely dry, release the sections and gently open up the waves by shaking them out or combing through them with your fingers.

Wash hair sparingly and use a good-quality shampoo.,
Try shampoos that do not contain sulfates or parabens.,
Use conditioner that matches your hair type, length, and treatment damage.,
Condition your hair properly based on hair type:


For fine hair: If you have very limp hair, try a botanical oil treatment before you shampoo.,
Be careful about using hair care products with too much protein.,
Rinse your hair with vinegar before shampooing, twice a year.,
Moisturize your hair.,
Let hair dry naturally.,
Don't brush your hair too much.,
After you shower, try using a wide toothed comb.,
Trim your hair regularly.,
Style your hair naturally, minimizing styling damage.,
Treat or dye your hair sparingly, if at all.,
Eat healthily.,
Remove stress from your life.",How to Take Care of Your Hair," Washing hair too often can leave hair dried out, leached of its natural oils, and may damage your hair. Aim to shampoo your hair at most every other day or only twice a week.;
, Sulfates are the chemicals that make shampoos lather up.Parabens are preservatives that cause irritation and eye problems after prolonged use. Both of these chemicals aren't healthy for you or the environment so try to use shampoos with natural cleansers.


Choose a shampoo that suits your hair type. Don't just go for any old shampoo; go for the shampoo that works for your hair type. Typical types include (but are not limited to):


Curly or coarse hair probably wants frizz-minimizing and softening shampoo.

Straight or oily hair probably wants a gentle shampoo designed for daily washing.

Coloured or treated hair probably needs a shampoo that's fortified with extracts or amino acids, because treating your hair is essentially damaging it.

Dry hair probably needs shampoos with glycerin and collagen to help restore some moisture into the hair.



, A good rule of thumb is to condition every time you shampoo your hair, although very processed or dyed hair probably needs a little more love than natural hair.



Deep condition once a week. Use a store-bought hair care product, or venture out on your own and try a homemade solution. Deep conditioning is very good for your hair. It keeps hair soft, healthy and moisturized.

, Use lavender or tea tree oil, for example, and work it under your cuticles before shampooing. Wash shampoo away and apply conditioner from the mid-shaft down to the end. Leave in for a minute before washing.
For medium to thick hair, use a moisturizer with natural hydrators. Keep your conditioner light. Apply conditioner all over your head and let stay for 2-3 minutes.

, Too much protein can leave your hair feeling desiccated and brittle. While protein is the building block of healthy hair, use conditioners that come with balanced ingredients.


Frizz-control serum can be used in small quantities to tame frizzes. Make sure you do not use too much, and wash once a week with a deep-cleanse shampoo to avoid build-up, which will leave hair looking dull and flaky.

, Doing this helps to make your hair look shinier and cleaner; plus, it treats dandruff. Use 1 part vinegar (preferably organic apple cider vinegar) to 3 parts warm water, then rinse and wash your hair as normal.

, Use five oils: almond, castor, olive, coconut and lavender oils. Mix together equal proportions of each. Alternately, use egg oil. Apply to the hair and leave in for four hours prior to showering out. Repeat twice a week.

, After you get out of the shower, wrap your hair in a cotton T-Shirt. Towels are made of fabric that is very rough and damaging to your hair, causing frizziness and split ends. Avoid brushing hair while wet, as it makes the hair brittle and weak. Only use a wide tooth comb to brush out tangles while hair is wet.


Try not to use a blow-dryer. Healthy hair does not respond well to heat. Hair can sustain heat damage easily, especially from blow-dryers. If you have to use a blow-dryer, dry your hair using the lowest temperature setting and limit usage to once a week.
If you shower before you sleep overnight, put your hair up in a bun and let it air-dry overnight. Your hair should be dry in the morning.

, Brushing your hair stimulates the follicles which promotes growth, but brushing too much too often, will cause damage to your hair strands that results in frizz and split ends. , Or, use your fingers, rather than a brush.

, The best way to get rid of split ends is to do it yourself. Take some hair shears and attack the split ends about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) above the splitting. Many women with perfect hair never have split ends because they make it a priority to get their hair trimmed, or trim it themselves, every 6-8 weeks.

, Styling by itself won't overly damage your hair, but repeated stylings multiple times per week put some serious strain on hair.


Avoid perming, crimping, straightening, curling, and bleaching or repeatedly coloring hair if at all possible. So you want to go out on Saturday night and need your hair straightened. That's fine. Just make it an occasional treat, not a permanent thing.
Don't use rubber bands to pull back or otherwise style hair. Rubber bands will encourage your hair to get snagged, ripping it out of the follicle.
Try not to use hairstyles that tightly pin or pull the hair back. Styles such as cornrows or tight ponytails can cause damage at the roots, or put stress on the follicles.
Instead, experiment with up-dos: a simple ponytail or chignon looks clean and requires very few hair products. You could also just keep your hair down and wear a headband.

, Dyeing and treating your hair can take a lot out of it. People who opt for au naturel often don't experience the same problem with dry, damaged, or over-processed hair.


If you do dye your hair, try it every once in a while. Take a break from dyeing and give your hair a little breather. It should respond favorably.

, Give your hair the right amount of vitamins. Since hair is made of proteins, eat a balanced diet rich in lean protein, whole grains, fruits and vegetables. A healthy diet will ensure hair that looks and feels better.


Make sure you get plenty of vitamin C. This vitamin strengthens hair.In addition, iron helps transport oxygen to blood vessels, zinc grows and repairs tissue, and omega-3 fatty acids grow healthy hair.Give your hair some time to show new brilliance. What you eat will not have an immediate difference on the hair you already have, but it will help with hair that is newly growing.

, Physical and mental stressors will keep your hair from realizing its full potential. Stress can cause hair loss, so try not to let stress overcome you. This means finding healthy emotional outlets for your stress: yoga, biking, meditation, or other forms of exercise all work well.

If there is not, condition your entire head using your usual conditioner, leave in for at least three minutes, then rinse out with cool water.


If you had your dyeing done professionally, think about booking a conditioning treatment right afterwards.
In general, products with a built-in conditioner often contain harsher, more damaging products. Be cautious if you decide to use one and take a look at the ingredients.
After dyeing, wait 48-72 hours before washing your hair again, and preferably don't even get it wet. This gives your hair time to recover.;
, In addition to your regular conditioning routine, use a deep conditioner once a week. If you get oily roots, simply rub the conditioner just into the tips of you hair. After a few minutes, it can be rinsed out.


Some conditioners are leave-in. If this is the case with yours, just dab or spray it on when your hair is damp out of the shower, and you're done!

, Warm water opens up your hair follicle and cold water seals it back up. In other words, warm water will allow your hair to soak up the moisture and cold water will keep it inside. So resist that urge to take a hot shower; your tresses will thank you later!

, Washing your hair actually dries it out, so if you can avoid it for a few days, do so (why the ponytail was invented, really). When you shower, throw your hair up and put it in a cap to keep it out of your way. Just because you don't wash your hair doesn't mean you're not showering!


Everyone has different needs. Some of us will need to wash every two days, some of us once a week. Just take a look at your roots: If they're oily, wash 'em. If not, bask in the extra time you have to get ready in the morning!
If you feel like you must do something to your hair when you shower, on days you don't wash just rinse and condition.

, You want shampoo that's not too heavy and sulfate-free. If they have added oils for nourishment, that's good, too. And it should be good for color-treated hair, of course!


Concentrate the shampoo on the roots and the conditioner on the ends. Conditioner is generally more oily -- you want nourished ends, not greasy roots.

, Decide what products will work the best for your needs while minimizing damage.Bleach lightens your hair by removing color and causes damage by raising the hair cuticle, which allows hair to tangle easily. This is why conditioning becomes important.
Semi-permanent or temporary dyes don't contain bleach so they can't lighten your natural hair color but are easier to apply and less damaging. Since they only last about 6 weeks they need to be applied more often, and doing it too often can also end up damaging your hair.
Permanent dyes last much longer but the ingredients necessary (oxidizers and ammonia) are more damaging to your hair.
Ammonia-free dyes replace the ammonia of permanent dyes with a less damaging compound. However, if you use too much of this product it can still damage your hair in a similar way as permanent dyes.

, Heated tools will only further dry and damage your hair. It'll be a sacrifice, but it can be done. Ponytails, headbands -- that frizz can be hidden. Think of it as a short-term solution for a long-term problem. So ditch the iron and go au natural a few days a week. You should see improvements in a few weeks' time unless your hair is seriously damaged.


If you're in a tight spot, try turning the heat down on your curling iron or straightener and avoid styling the same hair more than once so it can rest. It's not as good as not using it, but it's better than nothing.

, For most, 6-8 weeks is ideal if you're experiencing damage issues. Since the tips of hair seem to take the most damage from the hair dye, this is the best way to solve the problem. And for most of us, our hair doesn't grow beyond a certain point -- getting a trim will help rejuvenate it.

, Every day, eat a balanced diet. You know why the crash, fad and starvation dieters don't have good hair? Because you really are what you eat. If your body doesn't have enough nutrients to go around, it's certainly not going to give any to your hair! So make sure you get your protein, zinc, iron, and all your vitamins and minerals. Your hair, skin, and nails will look better for it.


Drinking lots of water helps, too. Just as apple cider vinegar can cleanse your tresses, water cleanses your entire body. The more hydrated you are, the healthier you are as a whole.

, The protein and lecithin in these guys is super hydrating from root to tip. And it can strengthen your hair, too, keeping it from breaking. Here's how to turn breakfast into a homemade hair softener:


Mix three eggs with a tablespoon of honey and two tablespoons of coconut or olive oil. Liberally apply to your hair and leave for thirty minutes. Wash out thoroughly and let air dry.
Half a cup of yogurt and 2 tablespoons of almond oil combined with 2 beaten eggs will form a creamy mixture you can apply to the length of your hair. Leave for thirty minutes and condition as normal.
Mayo works, too, but it can leave you smelling like a deli.

, Olive oil, coconut oil, castor oil and almond oil are your best bets here. A few drops of a sweet-smelling essential oil wouldn't hurt, either. You could either just put a few drops in your hands, rub them together, and rub your strands all over, or you can heat it up in the microwave.


To get serious, heat up four tablespoons over the stove. When it's hot but not too hot, take it off the stove and drizzle it onto your strands. Massage it in thoroughly. Cover your tresses with a hot towel to ensure your hair gets the most out of the treatment.

, Melt coconut oil in microwave until liquefied. Allow to cool slightly until you can touch it. Apply the lukewarm coconut oil through your hair thoroughly. Leave in for 5-4 hours (or as long as you want). Rinse out thoroughly.

, Slather on the sweet stuff and leave it for half an hour and rinse out, or combine it with avocado and egg for more of a cream. Use this as a deep conditioning treatment once a week.


Alternatively, you can just add some to your regular shampoo!

, Banana strengthens your hair and gets in healthy, and then avocado takes over and nourishes it, making it soft and shiny. To create a nice treatment, add a teaspoon or two of oil (any of the above kinds will do). Mix it up, apply to your hair, and leave for 30 to 60 minutes.

, Less of a moisturizer and more of a restoring agent, apple cider vinegar is a home remedy for many problems. It can restore the pH of your hair, stripping away all the synthetic products you've been slabbing on it that haven't really been helping. Basically, it's a cleanser for your fragile locks.

, Rinse your hair thoroughly with the mixture, leave it in for 15 minutes, and wash out. Then continue your routine as normal."

, Steaming your hair with oils in the appropriate way is a great investment; this will definitely benefit your hair in the long run.

",How to Part Your Hair for Your Face Shape," A deciding factor in finding your face shape is whether your face is longer than it is wide or wider than it is long.Use a flexible measuring tape or string to measure. Measure the length from the top of your hairline to your chin, and measure width all the way across your face at the level of the bridge of your nose. Also measure the width of the top of your hairline and the width across your jaw.Write down your measurements on a piece of paper to refer back to.
You have an oval face if your face length is 1.5 times the width.
You have a round face if your lengths and widths are almost the same.
An oblong face shape has much more length than width.
You have a square face if the width across your hairline is the same width as your jaw.
Heart shaped faces have their greatest width at the cheekbones paired with a forehead and jawline of almost the same width.
A diamond face is wider across the forehead and narrow at the chin with prominent cheekbones.;
, The shape of your jawline can also be a secondary indicator of the shape of your face.


If you have a squared jawline, you probably have a square face.
If you have a more soft, rounded jawline, you might have an oval, oblong, triangular or round face.
If your jaw comes to a point, you might have a heart or diamond face shape.

, You don’t necessarily have to determine all of your measurements to find your face shape. If you want, use a simpler method to determine your face shape by eyeing it.


After you get out of the shower, stand in front of the steamy bathroom mirror. Drawing the shape of your face in the steam of the mirror, or stand in front of a clear mirror, and draw your face in lipstick or eyeliner.This will help you more clearly see the shape of your face.

, Looking at celebrities can help you confirm your own face shape. Has anyone ever told you that you look like a celebrity? See what face shape that person has because yours might be similar.


Celebrities with round faces: Reese Witherspoon, Cara Delevingne, Kate Upton, Kate BosworthCelebrities with diamond faces: Tyra Banks, Viola Davis, Rihanna, Shilpa Shetty
Celebrities with heart faces: Julianne Moore, Lea Michele, Lucy HaleCelebrities with square faces: Olivia Wilde, Katie Holmes, Jennifer Garner, Rachel McAdamsCelebrities with oblong faces: Liv Tyler, Megan Fox, GiseleCelebrities with oval faces: Beyoncé, Charlize Theron, Jennifer Aniston, Olivia Munn, Do you have a “good side” when you take photographs? This might be due to facial asymmetry.


To find out how symmetrical your face is, take a blank white sheet of paper and cover one half of your face and then the other. Line the edge up with the middle of your nose. Does one half appear smaller?
If so, as you are parting your hair, part it above the larger side of your face to create the illusion of symmetry.

, Keeping that line, mark the part on top of your head, and brush your hair to either side.
Make sure the line is perfectly straight, as middle parts are very noticeable. You also want to keep your hair constantly clean.
For a round face, a middle part gives the appearance of a longer face and makes features look symmetrical.
In oblong faces, a middle part adds the look of roundness.
If you have an oval face you’re lucky because oval faces look great with any type of part.
If your face is asymmetrical, try a middle part that is just slightly off center. This will help you avoid accentuating the asymmetry of your face.

,


You probably have a natural side part. Comb through your hair with your fingers, and see where it naturally falls. This should line up about with the outside of your eyebrow. Then, use a comb to make this part more defined and neat.
Side-swept parts give square faces more softness. The part should be slight, as a deep side part will make the angles of the face stand out harshly.

,


Keeping your part on its natural side, comb your hair over farther than you naturally would. It might take time to train your hair to stay in a deeper part.
If you have longer hair, try parting your hair deeply, and then pulling it back into a ponytail so the part stays in place.
For heart shaped faces, the deep side part breaks up the sharp line of the chin and softens your cheekbones.
A deep part on diamond faces accentuates bone structure and good features.

, This part is more about style than complementing a certain face. It works well to give you a tousled-but-put-together vibe and add volume to your roots.To get a zig-zag part, just find your normal part, and use a comb to alternate pulling sections of your hair from each side of your head over the part in opposite directions. You can create just a few sections or lots of smaller zig-zags.
The zig-zag part is usually a centered part, but you can also create a zig-zag side part, if that suits your face shape better.

, When you are parting your hair, you can benefit from using product to get some lift at the roots, and make your hair look great.If you’ve just washed your hair, use a texturizing spray on damp hair before you blow dry.
If you haven’t washed your hair, work some dry shampoo into your roots.
If you’re trying to achieve a middle part, consider adding a shine serum or spray into your hair care routine.

, If you’re changing your part from one that you’ve had for years, it make take a little bit of coaxing to get your hair to cooperate.


To do this, wash your hair, and blow it dry.
As you are blow drying, use a round brush to lift the top of your hair near your crown up and back as you dry. Keep lifting, and don’t let it fall back into your former part. Once it’s dry, you can use a comb to create your new look.

, When you are working on the look of your part, it’s best to start with dry hair. If you part your hair while it’s wet, you risk it looking limp and flat.


If your part does start to look flat, use your fine-toothed comb to tease the hair around it slightly.
Side parts especially look great if they’re somewhat imperfect.

Trim off split ends.",How to Make Your Hair Soft and Silky3," Hair follicles produce natural oils that add shine and softness to your hair. Washing your hair repeatedly with harsh chemicals (such as those present in most shampoos) removes these oils. While these oils can build up and become greasy in appearance over time, washing your hair every day can also strip away the healthy oils. Try skipping a day or two between washes to help improve the look and feel of your hair.


If your hair is very fine or if you sweat a lot, then you should wash your hair every day.Use dry shampoo between washes to keep your hair looking fresh and clean.
People with fine and thin hair should wash their hair every other day while people with coarse or curly hair may only need to wash their hair once or twice a week.

, Conditioner can give you soft silky hair, so it is a good idea to leave a little on your strands. When you condition your hair, don’t rinse it for too long. Try to rinse your hair until most of the conditioner is out, but your hair still feels slick. This will help to ensure that your hair stays soft and silky all day.You may also want to wring the excess water out of your hair before you apply conditioner. This will help to ensure that your hair soaks up as much conditioner as possible.
For fine or thin hair, only apply conditioner to your strands. Do not apply it to your roots.

, Humectants are special ingredients that absorb moisture into your hair from the air and environment around you. Read the ingredients label of your hair styling products, and choose products that contain ingredients such as:

Glycerin
Propylene glycol
Butylene Glycol
Dipropylene glycol
HexanediolHoney

Try leave-in products.,
Use a natural hot oil treatment.,
Experiment with food.,
Get a professional treatment.",How to Make Hair Ends Softer1," One of the keys to making the ends of your hair softer is to keep your hair healthy and strong. In order to do that, you need to choose products that will do the job most effectively. Each person has individual hair needs, so pay close attention to the shampoo and conditioner you use.


If your hair is dry, look for a shampoo that boasts extra hydration. Dryness can be a major factor in keeping your ends looking rough.
A lot of people color their hair, and the process of dyeing your hair can cause damage. If you color yours, look for products that offer color protection.
Look for a shampoo that lists vitamin H and silk protein in the ingredients.These will help boost shine and silkiness.
Try different shampoos and conditioners. Your hair will react differently to each brand, so don't be afraid to experiment and find the one you like best.;
, In order to get extra moisture into your hair, you might need some products that take some time to soak in. Instead of using traditional conditioner that you rinse out right away, use some leave-in products to help smooth out your ends. There are a lot of effective leave-in conditioners you can try.Look for a light weight spray. A spray conditioner makes it easy to target specific areas, such as the ends of your hair.
The benefit of a leave-in conditioner is that it keeps adding moisture to your hair. This makes it much harder for your hair to dry out or develop split ends.
If you have fine hair, look for a formula that does not contain oil. Otherwise, you risk weighing your hair down.
Leave-in conditioners are great for smoothing out thick out. Since they act as a natural de-tangler, you will do less damage to your hair when combing it out.

, The chemicals in beauty products can sometimes cause damage to your hair. Consider making your own hair products. There are many natural ingredients that can help you achieve smooth and shiny hair.Try giving yourself a hot oil treatment. You can use a variety of oils that you probably already have at your house. You can use coconut, olive, avocado, or almond oils.
Gently heat a small amount of your chosen oil. Start with about 1/4 cup and heat in the microwave or the stove until the oil is hot, but not too hot to comfortably touch.
Before starting the hot oil treatment, wash your hair but don't dry it. When hair is damp, gently massage hot oil into your hair.
Wrap your head with a warm towel. Cover that towel with another to help seal in the heat. After an hour, rinse the oil out of your silky hair.

, Split ends are often a major problem. Fortunately, there are many food items that can be very beneficial for your hair. Head to your kitchen and look for some ingredients to help you give yourself an at home treatment. Try different combinations until you find the ones that work best for your hair.For example, you can combine the flesh of one avocado with 2 tablespoons of egg whites, and 3 tablespoons of olive oil. Mash together with a fork or spoon until you get a creamy consistency.
Apply the mixture to your hair and cover with a shower cap. After 1 hour, rinse your hair and wash with a gentle shampoo.
Try using the above method with different ingredients. Another great combination is the flesh of one papaya and 1/2 cup of plain yogurt.
You can also use beer to help make your hair silky and smooth. The proteins and sugars provide a lot of beauty benefits. Put beer in a spray bottle and spritz on hair. Rinse thoroughly and then wash with shampoo.

, If your hair refuses to cooperate, you might need to seek professional help. A professional stylist will have access to products that can not only make your hair shiny and smooth, but the results will last for several weeks or even months. Ask the employees at your salon to recommend a process that is right for you.


One option is to have a chemical straightening treatment. This will give you smooth, shiny locks.
Ask your stylist about thermal reconditioning. This is another chemical treatment that is suitable for thicker, curly hair.
A Brazilian Keratin treatment is a popular option. It is less harsh than other chemical processes.
Chemical treatments can be expensive, so make sure to inquire about price before booking your appointment.

Apply a mask regularly.,
Stick to a schedule.",How to Make Hair Ends Softer2," It turns out that there is actually a ""right"" way to wash your hair. And many people are doing it wrong. First, look at the amount of shampoo you are using. It's likely too much. You should not be using an amount greater than the size of a quarter.Avoid vigorously rubbing or massaging your head. Putting more pressure on your strands can actually cause fly-aways and rough ends.
Rinse shampoo out before conditioning. Make sure to get rid of excess water by gently squeezing or wringing out your hair.
Rinse your hair with cool water. Hot water can damage your color and your hair. You don't have to take a cold shower, but you should turn the water temperature down before you rinse.

Avoid tugging on your hair. It can be tempting to yank on tangles, but that can cause breakage. Take the time to gently work tangles out, using the comb and your fingers.
Keep your comb clean. A dirty comb can spread unwanted chemicals and dirt through your hair. Wash your comb with a gentle soap at least once a week.

, A mask is a product that you apply and leave on your hair for about an hour. They are a great way to add moisture to your hair. You can purchase hair masks at your local drug store or beauty supply store, or you can make your own.If you purchase a mask, consider buying one that contains Moroccan oil.

Attach the nozzle to the spray bottle to close it up.

, Since this formula contains hydrogen peroxide, it’s best to perform a strand test before applying it all over your hair. Spritz a small amount of the spray onto a tiny section of discreetly located hair (i.e. a piece on the underside of your mane).


Make sure you like the results before committing to an all-over application.
If you have dark brown or black hair, the highlights will be closer to auburn than blonde.

, After shampooing and conditioning, towel-dry your hair and then spray on the mixture. Run a comb through it to evenly distribute the formula and then style your hair as usual. It will take several applications before you start seeing results.


To heighten the lightening effects of the peroxide, you can go sit in the sun with the formula in your hair for 30 minutes. Be aware that peroxide is damaging to the hair and the sun increases the damaging effects.
You can also use a blow-dryer or any other heated tools to style your hair to see results faster.
Store the bottle in a cool, dry place out of direct light. Shake the bottle well before each application.

Know when to wash. People often make the mistake of thinking that they need to wash their hair everyday, but washing hair too often can actually dry hair out, or weigh it down with product.,
Use conditioner.,
Use a comb.,
Buy shampoo and conditioners suited to your hair type.,
Don't towel dry hair.,
Use hair dryer sparingly.",How to Keep Your Hair Healthy1," For most people, washing your hair twice a week is adequate.The longer, thicker, curlier, and more processed your hair, the longer it can go between washes.
If your hair gets oily very quickly and you must wash everyday, use a lightweight or ""everyday"" shampoo, as these contain milder detergents than others. Alternately, you can try soap nuts.;
, Always use a good conditioner after you shampoo. Conditioner will provide moisture for your hair, while making it softer and more manageable. It will also make your hair easier to brush out after the shower, thus causing less damage. Only apply conditioner to the ends and mid-lengths of your hair, otherwise your hair will look greasy.


Use a leave-in conditioner at least once a week. Leave-in conditioners penetrate deep into your hair cuticles to heal them more completely.
Try using a leave-in conditioner spray after you shower. The spray will make your hair more pliable and easier to detangle.
Every so often, try using a deep conditioning treatment. You can use deep conditioning treatments like olive oil, argan oil, avocado oil or coconut oil.

, Wet hair is more susceptible to damage than dry hair, it is more elastic and more likely to break. Since hair is most fragile when it's wet, you shouldn't rip a brush through it after washing. Instead, you should spray some detangler on it, and then use a wide-tooth comb to remove tangles and minimize breakage.


Remember to start from the ends up, not from the roots down.
Once hair is dry, avoid unnecessary brushing, combing or handling.
Using your fingers to comb through your hair while wet can cause damage and hair loss. Make sure to wait until after your shower to comb out any tangles.

, Pick a shampoo and conditioner combo for fine, greasy, dry or colored hair, and stick to it! No matter what type of hair you have, there’s a specialist product made to care especially for you.

, As hair is more fragile when wet, roughly towel drying hair can cause damage. Rubbing wet hair with a towel can rough up the cuticle (outer layer of the hair), causing more breakage and leading to frizzy or fluffy hair.


Instead of rubbing, trying blotting your hair with a towel to remove excess moisture.
Invest in a super absorbent towel that you can wrap around hair after washing.

, Frequent use of a hair dryer can dry out hair, causing breakage and split ends. Try to limit your use of a hair dryer as much as possible, let your hair dry naturally instead. If you do use a hair dryer, don't hold it too close to your hair, as this will cause your hair to burn.


Always apply heat protection spray or serum to hair before drying.
Try using a cooler setting on the hair dryer, to minimize damage.
Invest in an ionic hairdryer. An ionic hairdryer emits charged particles that can cut drying time in half (minimizing heat exposure) and encourages the hair cuticle to lie flat."

Make your wash efficient by only washing the hair every couple of days.,
Condition the hair on the ends and lower half of your hair.,
Occasionally, a hair mask is good to restore shine.,
Try products that benefit natural hair and which don't contribute to problems encountered by those with fine hair.,
Have your hair cut only when you feel it necessary.,
Include a subtle change in your diet.","How to Maintain Naturally Fine, Soft Hair"," Some people can manage three, but it is important to keep the hair clean ( depending on your personal taste). Use water which is comfortably warm ( avoiding a too hot temperature) and massage a small amount of shampoo over all the hair. Whilst rinsing out, the water should be clear.;
, Doing this helps keep this area soft and prevents the ends from being dried out. It is important not to apply conditioner at any time to the upper half of your hair or roots as natural oils are already produced here to condition. Using even more in this particularly sensitive area can cause the hair to feel weighed down. 

, Those with very curly or dry hair may find that hair masks work better for them if used more frequently to help moisturize the hair. If you hair is fine, every fortnight should be enough. Apply in the same way as conditioner, yet wait 5 minutes to give the mask a real chance to work.

, For example, shampoos with plant extracts to enhance color or with ingredients to improve strength. Also, vary your styling products. A little less than a handful of mousse can boost volume and some serum dabbed onto the hair after styling can help with texture. These would suit fine hair better than heavy gels or waxes. A quick mist of hairspray can keep odd hairs in place.

, Every few months is fine, and even a simple trim is sometimes more preferable. You don't have to always change your cut for nice hair, after all.

, Not as a drastic solution, but foods such as fish, vegetables or those with extra protein ( like yoghurt) are known to help with the shine of hair, as well as drinking enough water.

Apply a hair mask.,
Use serum.,
Use heat protection.,
Use UV shielding products.,
Avoid chemical-laden products.",How to Keep Your Hair Healthy2," Apply a hair mask at least once a month to provide deep conditioning and to encourage softness and shine. Use a hair mask that's specially designed for your hair type, whether your hair is dry, oily or colored. Good hair masks can be found in pharmacies and hair salons. Alternatively, you can make your own hair mask, using ingredients from your kitchen.



For all hair types: avocado and honey: Cut and scoop out the flesh from a ripened avocado and mix in a tablespoon of organic honey. Apply to hair and allow it to sit for 20 minutes before rinsing it off in the shower.For dry hair: olive oil and egg: Combine three tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil with two eggs and apply the mixture to your hair and let the mixture sit for 20 minutes before rinsing in the shower. If you do not like the smell of raw eggs, you can use a ready egg oil (eyova) instead.For oily hair: apple cider vinegar and lemon: Combine 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar with the grated peel of an entire lemon and allow it to set for 15 minutes to absorb the excess oil from your scalp, and then rinse in the shower.For flaky scalp: banana, honey and almond: Mash together 1/2 a ripe banana and add two tablespoons of honey and a few drops of almond oil and allow it to set with a shower cap on for 20 minutes before rinsing., Apply to serum to wet hair before drying, or to freshly blow-dried hair. It will help keep your hair soft and shiny, while minimizing frizz.


Usually only a very small amount of serum is required (dime-sized amount).
Apply serum to ends and mid lengths of hair, but avoid the roots, otherwise your hair will look greasy.

, It is crucial to apply some sort of heat protection product before subjecting your hair to high temperatures from irons and dryers. Heat is your hair's worst enemy, so use a heat-protection spray to lock in moisture and minimize burning and breakage.


Heat protection products come in many forms, including sprays, serums, mousses and creams.
Always apply heat protection to wet or damp hair to ensure it absorbs fully. If you apply to dry hair, it will sit on top of the hair and will not provide adequate heat protection.

, You know how important it is to protect your skin from harmful UV rays, but what about your hair? The sun can be drying and damaging to your hair, so it's important to use products that are specifically designed to minimize of sun damage. These products can help prevent highlighted hair from lightening too quickly and looking fried, and they can keep dark hair from turning brassy or red.Most UV shields are finishing products such as UV-based hairsprays or leave-in conditioners.
Keep in mind that UV shielding products always need to be applied to damp hair. Otherwise, they'll sit on the surface and won't sink into the hair., Avoid shampoos, conditioners and other hair care products that contain harsh sulfates, parabens or sodium chlorine. These ingredients will build up in hair over time, causing damage and weighing down your locks."

Salmon is full of essential omega-3 fatty acids, as well as having a high vitamin D and protein content, all of which are vital for strong, healthy hair. Omega-3 is really important for healthy hair, as it makes up approximately 3% of the hair shaft, while also being found in the body's natural oils which help to keep the scalp hydrated.You can also find omega-3 fatty acids in other fish, such as trout, herring, mackerel and sardines. Or if fish doesn't float your boat, try incorporating more avocado and pumpkin seeds into your diet.

, Besides making a delicious snack, walnuts have significant benefits when it comes to the health of your hair. Unlike any other type of nut, walnuts have a high omega-3 content and are rich in Vitamin E and biotin. Interestingly, walnuts also contain the mineral copper, which helps to protect and enhance your hair's natural color and shine.In addition to eating walnuts as a yummy salad and dessert topping, you can also sprinkle a little walnut oil over salad leaves, or use it in a stir-fry.

, These tasty shellfish have a high zinc content. Zinc is extremely important for healthy hair - in fact too little zinc in your diet can potentially lead to hair loss. It may also lead to a dry scalp and dandruff problems. Just three ounces of oysters contain almost five times your daily zinc requirement. They are also bursting with protein, which is extra good news for your hair.Zinc can also be found in nuts, beef, eggs and fortified cereals and whole grain breads.

, Sweet potatoes provide your body with high quantities of beta carotene, an antioxidant which aids in the production of vitamin A. Vitamin A stimulates the production of oils that hydrate and protect the scalp. A lack of vitamin A can lead to a dry, itchy scalp and problems with dandruff.Other natural sources of beta carotene include: cantaloupe, carrots, mangoes, apricots and pumpkin.

, Aside form being rich in protein (which makes up about 97% of hair) eggs contain four essential minerals, namely: zinc, selenium, sulfur, and iron. Iron is the most important of these minerals, as it enables the transport of oxygen to the hair follicles and helps to prevent anemia, an illness which can lead to hair loss.Other animal products, such as beef, chicken, pork and fish, can also help to increase your iron intake.

, Spinach is a super-food containing iron, beta carotene, folate, and vitamin C - all of which contribute to beautiful, shiny hair by stimulating oil production on the scalp and encouraging healthy hair follicles. If you're not a spinach fan, try eating other leafy vegetables with a high nutrient content, such as broccoli, kale, and Swiss chard.

, Lentils - the friends of vegans and vegetarians everywhere - are packed with loads of hair healthy vitamins and minerals, such as protein, iron, zinc, and biotin. So even if you're a meat-lover, you should try to incorporate some of these small but mighty legumes into your diet., Greek yogurt is high in protein (which hair loves) vitamin B5 (also known as pantothenic acid, which you'll find in many shampoos and conditioners) and vitamin D, which has recently been linked with healthy hair follicles.Other similarly beneficial dairy products include cottage cheese, low-fat cheese, and skim milk.

, Blueberries are a super fruit with numerous health benefits, but it's their high vitamin C content which really helps keep hair in top shape. Vitamin C stimulates circulation, which is essential for carrying the tiny blood vessels necessary for the health of the scalp and hair follicles. Without enough vitamin C, hair would become brittle and break., Nothing beats poultry for providing protein, in addition to providing zinc, iron, and B vitamins which help keep hair strong and thick. As hair is almost completely made of protein, protein-rich foods are literally the foundation for great hair, so eat to your heart's (or hair's!) content.Turkey, lean beef, oily fish, pork chops and veal are other great sources of protein.

, Although maintaining a healthy diet is an excellent way to get the vitamins necessary for healthy hair, taking a vitamin supplement can make it easier to ensure that you are getting all of your daily requirements. The top 5 vitamin supplements you should take for healthy hair are biotin, vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin B5 and Inositol.Remember to check with your health care professional before adding any supplements to your diet.

So keeping it moisturized with conditioner is essential for healthy curly hair.You can condition your hair while in the shower, or try some leave-in conditioner.;
, These products will likely contain the same ingredients as products designated for curly hair. They’ll target the dryness and breakages, and that’s what matters.

, These ingredients will dry your hair out even more and lead to more damage. Many hair products are alcohol and silicone free; you just have to look at the labels to figure out which ones are., Many experts swear by the dry/no shampoo method. This is when you wash your hair with just water, or you only use conditioner in the shower (but no shampoo). This is meant to help your hair combat dryness and breakage. , Put products on your sopping wet hair, even before you pat it dry with a towel. This will help your hair maintain as much of the moisture as possible from the water. , When it comes to styling products, less is more. The less you put in your hair, the less greasy/oily buildup you’ll have to work against later. For styling serums, use a quarter-sized amount; for mousse, use a golf ball-sized amount., Simply comb out your dry hair and spray it with a mixture that is half water and half leave-in conditioner. Comb the product into your hair, from the roots down, and then let your hair air dry. This will keep your curls looking fresh. , Products like hairdryers and hair straighteners are great for people with curly hair who want to switch their style up, but they are terrible at damaging and drying out hair. If you use these heat-based products on a regular basis, you will get more split ends and damaged hair. Try to avoid drying and straightening your hair as much as possible.


Using a diffuser to dry your hair is better because it will not damage your hair as badly as a hairdryer.

, Don't towel dry your hair; only dab the towel over your hair to soak up water. This prevents tangles and breaks. You can then brush your hair out with a wide-tooth comb.

, Brushing curly hair is a bad idea because it can break the strands and further damage your hair. Try to use a wide-toothed comb to gently detangle your hair instead of ripping through tangles with a brush., Swimming is a fun summertime activity, but if you have curly hair the chlorine can be very harmful. If you go swimming, make sure you use a shampoo and conditioner that helps against chlorine damage to your hair.

, Curly hair can lose a lot of its length from the curl itself. So make sure your stylist cuts your hair when it is fully dry so you know that you’re getting the style you want., Cotton pillowcases soak up moisture from your (already dry) curly hair, so try using a satin or silk pillowcase instead. This will also prevent friction and breakage while you sleep."

Shampoo hair.,
Don't over-wash hair.,
Purchase a filter for your shower head.,
Use water softeners to combat hard water.",How to Have Soft Hair1," Use warm water and work your hair into a healthy lather. Washing it every few days will remove all the dirt off, leaving it soft and manageable.


Comb your hair gently before you rinse out the shampoo. Do not use a brush while your hair is wet, but use one after you've rinsed the shampoo away. Rinse the shampoo off once you have combed your hair.
Avoid washing your hair with scalding hot water. Scalding water steals away the natural moisturizing oils from the hair. Use warm to cold water instead.;
, Hair has natural oils that come out with soap and water, and though conditioner can help replenish this oil, natural is better. Be sure to brush hair thoroughly, as this spreads these oils throughout the hair. For people with kinky or curly hair that frizzes when it is brushed, hair brushing should be done when hair is wet.









Simply wetting hair without washing, and before brushing can work, though you might want to apply a serum or leave-in conditioner that will help your hair from becoming overly frizzy.
People with oily hair can wash it more often, but people with dry hair should not wash their hair more than twice a week.
To shower without washing your hair, wear a shower cap or twist your hair into a bun and keep soap out of the bun. Be sure to brush your hair after it is cooped up in a bun or shower cap.

, You can find one at most hardware stores and home-and-garden stores. It will filter out the chlorine and various minerals from the water, resulting in healthier hair and skin.

, Dilute a tablespoon of powdered water softener (e.g., Calgon or 20-mule Borax) in a cup of warm water. Use it first to rinse shampoo out of your hair.

Make an apple cider vinegar treatment.",How to Have Soft Shiny Hair Inexpensively1," Coconut oil can quickly cure your split ends and give your hair a smooth texture.The coconut oil must be unrefined, otherwise it won't soak into your hair as it should. Your main goal is to condition your ends to eliminate dryness; the scalp is where much of your natural oils are and won't need quite as much attention. To successfully complete a coconut oil treatment, you need to:

Let the oil sit on your hair for at least thirty minutes.
Rinse your hair with cold water, then shampoo and condition like normal.

Let it sit for 5-6 minutes.
Rinse your hair again with lukewarm water.
Lastly, rinse with cool water.

, Yogurt can add softness and shine to your hair while also de-frizzing and repairing damage.Make sure the yogurt is plain, otherwise you will end up with more sugar and food colourings in your hair, which isn’t something you want.</ref> Use plain yogurt, although plain Greek yogurt works very well also.

Use an iron made of a high quality material.,
Opt for an iron that has adjustable temperature controls.,
Consider the size of your iron.,
Dry your hair completely.,
Apply a heat protectant.,
Heat each section of hair briefly.,
Use a moisturizing shampoo.,
Deep condition your hair weekly.,
Moisturize your hair with oil.,
Get regular trims.",How to Keep Hair Healthy when Using Irons Daily," If you’re going to use a straightening or curling iron on your hair daily, it’s important that to select one that’s made with a material that will do the least damage to your hair. Inexpensive irons are usually made with metal that doesn’t heat evenly so it can easily burn your hair. You'll pay more for an iron made with a higher quality material, but it will help minimize damage.Ceramic irons heat quickly and evenly, so they’re not as likely to burn your hair. They also produce negative ions that help smooth cuticle and boost shine. Be sure to choose an iron that’s made of ceramic and not just coated with it. A ceramic coating will eventually wear off over time.
Tourmaline irons can produce 6 times the amount of negative ions that ceramic models do. As a result, you’re left with smooth, shiny, healthy looking hair.
Titanium irons are usually the most expensive, but they heat quickly and evenly. They’re a particularly good option for thick or coarse hair.;
, Many straightening and curling irons only have low, medium, and high heat settings. To keep your hair from getting damaged, you want to use the lowest heat possible to give you your desired style. That’s why it’s best to purchase an iron with digital heat controls that allow you to choose a specific temperature to heat to.In general, an iron that allows you to set the temperature between 175 degrees to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (80 degrees to 200 degrees Celsius) is sufficient for all hair types.
The finer or thinner your hair is, the lower the temperature on your iron should be. Start at 175 degrees (80 degrees Celsius), and only raise the temperature if your hair isn’t curling or straightening properly.
No matter how thick or coarse your hair is, you should never set your iron to higher than 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius).

, The size of your straightening or curling iron can also affect how damaged your hair becomes. If you use a larger iron, you’re less likely to need to go over the same section of hair twice to curl or straighten it properly. In general, a 1-inch (23-mm) curling or straightening iron is the most versatile for all hair types.If you have a shorter hair, you may want to use a smaller iron.
If you have extremely thick or long hair, you may want to use a larger iron.
When it comes to curling iron, it’s also important to consider the hairstyle that you’re going for. If you want tight ringlet curls, you’ll want to use a smaller curling iron. If you want loose waves, you’ll want to use a larger curling iron.

, Before you use any type of iron on your hair, it’s crucial that you dry it first. If your hair is wet when you apply heat to it, you will literally boil the moisture out of it and do serious damage. Allow your hair to dry completely before you pick up your iron.Because you’ll be applying heat to your hair with the iron, it’s best to air dry your hair before styling it. Using a blow dryer on your tresses means that you’ll be treating it with a double dose of heat, which can do more damage.

, Before you use your curling or straightening iron, you want to protect your hair so it won’t lose too much moisture from the heat. Work a heat protectant product through all of your hair -- it will coat your locks so they don’t lose their natural moisture.For fine or thin hair, a heat protectant spray is usually the best option.
For thick or coarse hair, a heat protectant oil, cream, or lotion is usually the best option.
Look for a heat protectant that contains humectants, such as panthenol and propylene glycol, to lock in moisture, and silicones, such as amodimethicone and dimethicone, to provide insulation from the high temperatures.When you’re curling or straightening your hair, it’s a good idea to use a heat protectant product that also has some hold to it so you can lock in the curls or straightness.

, If you leave the iron on any one section of hair for too long, you run the risk of burning it. To avoid damage, never leave the curling or flat iron on a single section of hair for more than 3 to 5 seconds.When you’re straightening your hair, be sure to keep the iron moving over to avoid heating any one spot for too long.

, Heat styling with an iron strips your hair of the natural moisture that keeps it healthy. To keep your hair hydrated, switch to a moisturizing shampoo that will clean your locks while also delivering moisture-rich ingredients. Look for a formula that contains natural oils such as argan or coconut.Be sure to use a sulfate-free shampoo. Sulfates help create lather for shampoos, but they’re also very drying.

, While you should use a traditional conditioner each time you shampoo your hair, it’s also important to deliver a more intense dose of hydration at least once a week. Using a deep conditioner or a hair mask, which contains hydrating ingredients such as argan oil, coconut oil, shea butter, and keratin, can help keep your hair moisturized even if you heat style everyday. Apply it once a week for the best results.Consult the instructions on the deep conditioner’s packaging to determine the correct way to use it. Most formulas require putting in on wet, freshly shampooed hair and allowing it to sit for 20 to 30 minutes before washing it out.
If you have extremely dry, thick, or coarse hair, you may want to use the deep conditioner every time that you wash your hair.

, Both traditional and deep conditioners are washed out of the hair, so their moisturizing effects don’t always last all day. After you wash your hair, apply a hair oil to your locks to keep them hydrated throughout the day.Squeeze several drops of the oil into your palm, and rub it between your hands. Gently smooth the hands over your hair and work the oil through your entire head.
If you have fine or thin hair, rosemary and pomegranate seed oils are good options.
If you have thick or coarse hair, avocado, coconut, and olive oils are good options.

, The ends of your hair are the spot that’s going to show the damaged from heat styling the most quickly with spilt ends and breakage. By getting your hair trimmed every 6 to 8 weeks, you’ll remove the damaged hair so your locks look healthier overall.When you get your hair cut, it’s a good idea to ask your stylist for tips on keeping your hair healthy. She might be able to provide tips for using irons on your particular type and style of hair, so you can minimize damage.

Try using a mixture of pure coconut oil and almond oil. Avocado, tea tree, castor, rosemary, lavender, olive, and argan oil may also help soften your hair.

, We all know we need to brush our hair to get it looking its best, but there's an art to brushing that many people overlook.


Avoid brushing wet hair. It's hard to do, but wait for your hair to dry out a bit before you bring the brush down on it. When you need to brush wet hair, use a wide-toothed brush with rounded tips. This will help cut down on split ends and reduce torn hair.

Get your hair trimmed often.",How to Have Healthy Hair," Do you wash your hair every single day? This can really dry it out, since you're washing away the oils your scalp produces to keep your hair shiny and healthy. Washing every day can also lead to oily hair, since stripping your hair of its oils causes your oil glands to go into overdrive. Try this routine instead:


Wash your hair just three or four times a week. Giving your hair a break in between washings will restore its balance. It might be a little oily for the first week or so, but your hair will soon look more healthy and vibrant than ever.
Rinse out your conditioner with cold water. Hot water is hard on your hair and can lead to split ends and frizz. Rinsing out your conditioner with cold water seals the cuticle, resulting in shiny, bouncy hair.;
, Think of your hair like your best silk dress. After hand washing it, would you ball it up and wring it out? No, that would destroy its shape and fibers. Your hair is similarly fragile and needs to be treated with care to stay healthy.


After washing your hair, gently pat it dry with a towel instead of wringing it out. Let it finish air drying.
Use a comb instead of a brush. Forcing a brush through tangled hair can cause it to rip and break. Use a wide-toothed comb to gently work through the tangles from bottom to top to prevent breakage.

, Put away your hair dryer, straightener, curling iron, and hot rollers unless you have a special occasion at hand. Applying heat to your hair can damage it, so it's best to let your hair air dry instead.


If you want to use the blow dryer sometimes, use it on a cool setting.
When you do use heat styling devices, be sure to put a protective serum in your hair beforehand.

, Try an egg yolk and olive mask, a vinegar rinse, or put plain yogurt or sour cream on your locks. Search online for instructions.

,, Commercial hair care products promise great results, but they often contain ingredients that can dry out your hair and leave it looking limp and dull. You'll probably notice a difference right away if you switch to products made with herbs, oils, and creams made that nourish hair.


Most shampoos are made with strong cleansers called sulfates that strip the natural oils from your hair and cause it to get frizzy and frayed. Choose a natural, sulfate-free shampoo made with cleansing herbs and oils instead. Check out a natural foods store for options. Try using no shampoo at all for the least amount of chemicals.
Conditioners made with aloe, coconut oil, shea butter and other pure substances add moisture to your hair and keep it looking healthy and fresh.
Avoid using styling products that contain a lot of chemicals with names you can barely pronounce. You can make your own hair gel and hairspray instead of using the store-bought kind.

, The chemicals in dye, bleach, Brazilian blowouts, chemical straighteners, and chemical curlers can do a lot of damage if you use them too often.

, To restore your hair's softness and shine, apply oil to your roots, shaft and especially tips a couple times a week. You can use oil in place of conditioner or after your hair is already dry. Once every few weeks, give yourself a deep conditioning treatment as follows:


Massage olive oil or almond oil into your hair.
Cover your hair with a shower cap or plastic wrap.
Let the oil sit in your hair for 2 hours or overnight.
Rinse it out with cool water until the water runs clear, then shampoo and condition as normal.

, This will help your hair to look shiny; it also improves hair health. Use it twice weekly.


Grab an aloe leaf and peel off the outer, to reach the transparent gel.
Apply the aloe gel all over your hair,
Leave in for 10 to 15 minutes.
Wash the aloe out with water.

, A well-balanced diet with plenty of protein, vitamin B, iron, and omega-3s helps your hair stay as thick and healthy as possible.


Vitamin B keeps hair thick and strong. Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables and nuts to get enough vitamin B.
Eat beef, chicken, pork, fish and leafy greens like kale and spinach to get iron and protein.
Salmon, walnuts, and avocados are excellent sources of omega-3s, which help your hair stay shiny and healthy.
You can supplement your diet with vitamins designed to make hair stronger. Try prenatal vitamins, which contain a mix of ingredients that lead to great hair, nails, and skin.

, Just as you would protect your skin from sun, wind, and cold temperatures, you need to protect your hair as well. If you don't, it will dry out and become brittle over time.


When the sun is strong, wear a hat or scarf over your hair to protect it from getting too fried.
Don't go outside during the winter with wet hair. When your hair freezes it can get brittle and frayed.
You should also protect your hair from chemicals. Don't expose your hair to chlorine too often. When you go swimming, wear a swim cap.

, This is an important step for keeping your hair healthy. You should get a trim every 6 weeks, or as soon as your ends begin to split. Keeping your hair trimmed will make sure the ends don't split very far up the shaft. Your hair will be less likely to break, and it will look healthy and full of life.

When it comes to selecting the best shampoo, decide what your hair needs most. If you dye or add color to your hair, select shampoos that will protect your treatment. Also, most shampoos have extra benefits such as volume and shine. Purchasing multiple shampoos for different benefits is a good idea because most shampoos have a long shelve life. , Hair is both young and old, with the younger being closest to the scalp and the natural oils. By lathering from the root to the tip, you help move the oils to the oldest, driest parts of the hair. Doing this will help longer hair stay healthy without worries of dried, split ends.

, Washing hair boils down to two parts, the lather and the rinse. For the lather, a warm temperature helps ensure the shampoo gets a good lather while rinsing away soap particles. For the final rinse, cool water helps ingredients lock in to your hair.


Avoid using really hot temperatures. Too much hot water can damage hair and dry up your scalp.
Rinse out all soap. The amount of shampoo you use is up to you, but do not leave soap in your scalp.

, Shampoo does only so much for hair. Conditioner helps two fold. It makes hair more manageable, and it helps prevent split ends. Utilize a good conditioner after rinsing out your hair. When showering, leave the conditioner in your hair for a while before rinsing it out, and even then, spend less time rinsing out conditioner than you would shampoo.Figuring out the best conditioner for you can be trial and error. The key to a good conditioner is one that helps you style your hair.

, After a shower, our hair is at its most vulnerable. Fresh from cleaning, hair can be damaged easily if dried too aggressively. Be sure to damp the scalp and be gentle with the tips. For better drying, try a microfiber towel; it's smoothness and lightweight help ensure gliding through the hair. For another simple trick that is more cost efficient, use a t-shirt. A t-shirt will not have the rough grooves of a towel. The t-shirt can smooth out the hair and prevent the stripping away of essential oils of the scalp, and as an added benefit, it will help prevent frizz."

Use olive oil no more than once a week, before you take a shower.,
Warm a small bowl of olive oil in the microwave.,
Consider mixing the olive oil with almond oil and egg.,
Rub the olive oil all over your hair while it is dry.,
Leave the olive oil in your hair for 30-60 minutes.,
Rinse out the olive oil.,
Let your hair air dry.",How to Have Healthier Hair Using Olive Oil," Set aside a day or night when you don't need to go anywhere. You'll want to let the olive oil sit in your hair to get the full effect, and your hair may remain somewhat greasy even after you rinse out the oil.


Don't shampoo your hair before using olive oil: the treatment will work better as a conditioner if your hair is clean, but not shampooed. Shampoo is an astringent, and it will strip your hair of oils.
It is okay to wash your hair and condition it before using olive oil. However, the most effective tactic is to apply the oil first, then rinse your hair afterward.;
, You may also use a pot on the stove, but you'll need to be extra-vigilant to make sure that it doesn't overheat! The olive oil doesn't need to be super hot – just warm enough to be more fluid, which helps saturate your hair.

, This may lend your hair more shine and help replenish lost nutrients. You may also consider combining the olive oil with other essential oils like almond oil, tea tree oil, and jojoba oil. Try making a mixture using the following increments:


1 egg. Consider using the whole egg, not only the yellow part, because the whites contain the hair-healing renewing agents. The egg-white is even more important if you have acne or skin deficiencies.
1 teaspoon of raw almond oil. This step is optional, but it really helps to smooth your skin and hair. This is especially important if you're using a high-acidity olive oil.
1 spoonful of olive oil. You can even make it 1.5 or 2 spoonfuls.

, Pour the oil on your head and massage thoroughly throughout, from scalp to tip. Use a liberal amount; don't skimp on the oil!


Make sure to do this in the bathroom or somewhere else that's easy to clean. Ideally, stand in the shower, the tub, or outdoors, and don't wear any clothes that you don't want to get oily. There's a good chance that some of the oil will spill!

, Put a plastic bag or foil around your hair to retain the oils. If your hair is long, bundle it up on top of your head, to help keep a little heat in (similar to bleaching hair). The bag or foil will help keep oil off of things if you sit down and help keep some of the heat in. This consistence in heat will help the olive oil saturate the hair and also give your scalp a good moisturizing!


To speed up the process, stretch a shower cap or foil over your hair and take a warm shower. The steam and heat will help your hair absorb the olive oil more quickly.

, After the oil has been in your hair for 30-60 minutes, it's time to rinse! Take the bag/foil off and undo your hair. If you haven't done so already, hop in the shower and run warm water through your locks.


Do not use shampoo for this shower. Again, shampoo can strip the oils from your hair, reversing the healthful effect of the olive oil treatment. Conditioner is okay.

, Your hair may feel a little greasy while it dries; that's why it's good to do this on a day off. This extra little step will add to the health factor, especially if you use a lot of hot tools on your hair. If everything is done right, your hair should feel a bit more full and flexible.

Wash your hair correctly.,
Dry your hair carefully with a blow dryer.,
Avoid brushing your hair while it's wet.,
Give your hair some special treatment from time to time.,
Go easy on styling products.,
Accessorize your healthy, gorgeous hair.,
Eat healthy foods that will keep your hair strong and lustrous.",How to Have Great Hair1," If you can, try not to wash your hair every day. Daily baths and showers will strip your hair of its natural oils. That being said, if you apply products such as hair spray, mousse, gel, and anti-frizz products, these build up in your hair and inhibit the distribution of your hair’s natural oils. It's advisable to wash hair products out of your hair as regularly as is required. If you never use hair products, you may get away with never using shampoo and just rinsing your hair occasionally.


Massage your scalp with the shampoo, not with conditioner. Do this for about 40 seconds before washing it out. If you have oily hair, repeat the process once more (with the shampoo, not conditioner). When you massage the top of your head, the circulation increases and it also helps prevent dandruff. Use a sulfate and silicone free shampoo if your hair is curly or wavy. Sulfate-free shampoos help to prevent frizz.
Pour conditioner into your hand and rub from the tips of your hair to the roots. If you want softer silkier looking hair, leave the conditioner in your hair for a few minutes before you rinse it off.
Try to wash your hair on the coolest setting that is comfortable or at least try giving it a final rinse of cool water. This seals the hair cuticles (the outermost layer of the hair shaft) and locks in moisture, making it shinier. Hotter water may be used occasionally to wash hair if you have very oily or dirty hair. Either way, try rinsing in cool temperature water for the final rinse.;
, Blow dryers can be more benefiting than air-drying if you use them correctly. When you blow dry your hair, put it on a cool setting and hold distance it away to protect it from any heat. If you hold the blow dryer too close, the water in your hair can heat up and damage your hair. This is why hair dryers are known to be bad, but if you use it correctly it is very good. If you can, avoid drying your hair with heat as much as you can; it will only damage your hair.


Avoid wringing your hair with a towel after you get out of a shower. Wet hair is more fragile, and wringing it could cause your hair strands to break or fall out.
Use some heat protection spray when you blow-dry your hair. You should also use protection spray when you use hot rollers or a flat iron or a curling iron or GHD type straighteners.

, Wet hair is stretchier and has a tendency to break. Also, don't brush your hair too much. People say that brushing your hair 100 strokes a day will make it smoother, but this is a myth. Brushing your hair this much will only cause breakage to your hair.


When you do brush your hair, try a natural bristle brush like a boar bristle brush. These brushes distribute oils throughout your hair to make it softer and shinier.
Only use a wide-tooth comb on wet hair. Apply leave-in conditioner or detangler to make your hair more pliable.

, Treating your hair with some special restorative products can help to improve your hair’s health.


Apply a deep conditioning treatment. You can use deep conditioning treatments like egg oil, olive oil, argan oil, avocado oil or coconut oil.
You can also purchase a hair mask or hair cream and apply it.
Use a natural treatment like olive oil, mayonnaise and an egg or a soak in full-fat milk. Leave these treatments in for 2 to 3 hours and rinse them out thoroughly without applying shampoo or conditioner. You can do this once or twice per week if you see good results.
Use a leave-in conditioner at least once a week. Leave-in conditioners penetrate deep into your hair cuticles to heal them more completely.
Try a spray leave in conditioner/ detangler after you shower. The conditioner will make your hair more pliable and manageable.

, Styling products can dry your scalp if you use it directly at the scalp. Try not to use it often, but if you must, apply to hair strands and not the scalp. Then, style your hair at most four times a week to avoid damaging it.


Make sure to avoid using any products that contain alcohol. Alcohol can dry out your hair.

, Clips or barrettes can compliment beautiful hair. Coordinate them with your outfits or your personality. If you use elastics, use fabric-covered elastics to prevent breakage and tangles.

, Your diet can also prevent hair loss.


Essential fatty acids, especially omega-3 fatty acids, promote healthy skin, hair, and nails. You should eat some of these foods, which are rich in omega-3, every day:

Salmon, tuna, mackerel, and other fatty fish
Flax seed oil
Walnuts, almonds, and milk


Vitamins B-6, B-12, and folic acid are also important to your hair. You can always take a multivitamin to get more of these nutrients, but you can also add foods rich in these vitamins to your diet.

Vitamin B-6: bananas, potatoes (both white and sweet) and spinach.
Vitamin B-12: meat, poultry, fish and dairy products.
Folic acid: citrus fruits, tomatoes, whole grain and fortified grain products, beans and lentils.


Protein also promotes healthy hair. Eat a daily serving of fish, chicken, eggs or soy."

The best kind of hairspray will do more than create stiff hair; it can keep the volume in your hair or make curls keep both their hold and their bounce.

, Loose hairs and frizz can be the equivalent of a stain on a nice dress or suit. Even after drying your hair correctly and applying conditioner, heat and daily activity can cause frizz that would take away from your styling. In order to combat loose hairs and static, keep touch-up products in your purse. These on-the-go sprays such as frizz serum are very handy for minor adjusts., If you style your hair the night before or receive a treatment that you wish to maintain overnight, sleep on a silk or satin pillow case. The friction that occurs between your hair and pillow during sleep will undo your style throughout the night. Moreover, the smoothness of the silk or satin prevents split ends while the material adjusts in the cold and warm weather to keep your hair cool. "

Most dandruff shampoos can be used around twice a week. Be sure to make using a dandruff shampoo a part of your routine. Waiting for the signs of dandruff and prolonging treatment will only cause damage to your hair.

, We hear about the benefits of trims, but more often then not, we hear a trim helps hair grow. While hair grows at a specific rate given the season, trims prevent us from living with split ends. Split ends mean dry and damaged hair, so visit a stylist once a month to every other month in other to rid yourself of split ends., Hair dries up easily from heat and heat treatments, and when the oils from our scalp can replenish our hair, using some oils that mimic our scalps oils is a solid practice that will give hair both shine and health. Try using different types of oil such as jojoba, argan, coconut, olive, or grapeseed. Try applying oils at least once a week. , We become what we eat. The fast and unhealthy food we eat seeps through us, and the damage will show in our hair. For healthy hair, we need a healthy diet.

Know when to use your brush.,
Don't use heat styling tools as often.",How to Grow Your Hair Thicker Naturally1," How often do you wash your hair? If it's every single day, you're actually hurting your hair in the long-term and preventing it from getting thicker. Washing your hair every day removes the natural oils produced by your scalp to protect your hair and keep it healthy.


Washing your hair three to four times a week is a healthier routine. This gives your hair a chance to get the benefits of the oils your scalp produces. Your hair might look a little oily when you first start this new routine, but it should balance out in a week or two.
If you feel that your hair needs shampooing more often, try dry shampoo. You can use dry shampoo between regular washings, which can be great for people who sweat a lot or have really oily hair.
Wash your hair with cold water. Hot water is hard on the hair, causing it to dry out and get brittle. Washing your hair with cold water helps the hair shaft lie flat, protecting it from breakage and damage.;

Coconut oil, in particular, is great for softening the hair (and skin) and is available in many grocery stores.Be aware that it can make the hair look greasy, so apply it overnight not to wear during the day.
Other natural products - like eggs and beer- can also be good for the hair.;
, Take a little bit of olive oil and one egg, and beat it well. Leave it in your hair for about 5 minutes.


After rinsing it, you could use coconut oil with conditioner. Or try other oil mixtures. You could also mix together a tablespoon of olive oil, a teaspoon of vitamin E oil and 1 1/2 tablespoons of your favorite conditioner (make sure you have the matching shampoo, but don't add the shampoo to the mixture). The mixture does not make your hair oily if you shampoo well.
Put either mixture through your hair (your hair should not be wet) and leave it on anywhere between 5-20 minutes, depending on how much time you have (obviously 20 minutes will work better, although 5 minutes will still work.)
Get in the shower after your preferred time, and wet your hair. Be sure to get all of the mixture out. Comb your hair.

, Separate the yolk from an egg. There can't be any whites in the yolk. You can do this using a plastic bottle. The mouth of the bottle must be placed on the egg yolk, and the bottle should be squeezed slowly.

, That means not washing your hair daily. If you have really oily hair, you could wash it more frequently than someone with dry hair.


Shampoo cuts down on your hair's natural oils that keep it soft and shiny. So frequent shampoo is a quick way to dry out the hair.

, When you look for a shampoo or conditioner, choose products that won't fry or burn out your hair. They might cost a bit more, and come at a salon instead of a grocery store, but they are probably better for your hair.You may also consider keratin treatments or deep conditioning treatments at a spa. Let a professional help you get more softness.
Try to find hair products that promote softer hair. Deep conditioners are a great way to get softer hair. You can find some as cheap as $2 at drugstores. When looking for a deep conditioner, look for descriptive words like ""smoothing, soft, deep conditioning,"" and ""healing.""
Leave the condition on the hair for 5 minutes, rinse, then comb your hair one last time. After your hair dries, use a leave in conditioner and a shine spray (not a hair spray; a shine spray that just, well, adds shine.) If you want to get soft hair, make sure that you're using shampoo at the scalp and conditioner at the ends of your hair.

, Some people are not well aware of the hair type they have, and they end up splurging on the wrong products. Determine whether your hair is considered fine or thick, curly or straight.


Use a nourishing shampoo, and condition your hair every alternate wash. Buy a conditioner suited to your hair (e.g., oily, dry, fine, thick).Try a new product to give your hair a break, and see how your hair adapts to it. Everyone's hair is going to react to products differently.
Get your hair trimmed frequently. Getting a frequent trim - say every six weeks - will remove the split ends that makes hair look dry. Brush your hair thoroughly daily, but not when it is wet. Use a wide-toothed comb instead.

, Omega-3 found in fish, cod liver oil and other nutrients will give you softer hair. Remember: For hair to be soft, it has to be healthy.

There should be a white soapy foam appearing from the reaction between the shampoo and water. The more bubbles there are, the cleaner your hair is.


Find products with silicone or natural oils that will hydrate the hair follicle.
For curly hair, wash your hair with a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner to hydrate your hair. This will allow for shinier hair from the onset. You can buy any moisturizing shampoo or conditioner at your local drugstore or grocery. For straight hair, deep clean your hair once a week. Purchase a deep-cleaning shampoo and conditioner. This variety of shampoo will remove grease and build up from any products you've used in the past week.;
, Hot water can damage your hair follicle. Make sure there is no soap residue left on your hair or face. Gently wring out the soaked water from your hair.

, Squeeze a dime sized amount. Rub in both hands and apply directly to the bottom ends of your hair. Use your fingers to work through the different sections of your hair. Avoid putting the conditioner near the scalp. Allow the conditioner to work for about 1-2 minutes. This will help the conditioner to do it's job in making your hair soft and shiny.

Reduce your stress.",How to Grow Long Thick Hair," It is certainly tempting to wrangle your locks into complete submission with the use of blow dryers, flat irons, and curling wands, but these hot tools can actually be detrimental to adding length and thickness to your hair. The extreme heat damages hair, making it more likely to break off mid-strand and appear fried. When possible, let your hair air-dry and use heatless styling methods.;
, Just like heat, the chemicals present in dyes and relaxers are highly likely to cause breakage in your strands. What does this mean? Short, frizzy, and damaged looking hair. Stay away from these chemicals whenever possible, and use all-natural dyes and lightening solutions (such as henna) instead of the harsh chemical versions.

, The oil that causes hair to look greasy is called sebum, and is responsible for strengthening and adding nutrients to your scalp and locks. Therefore, if you’re washing your hair on a daily basis, you are removing the natural ingredient your body produces to help thicken and lengthen your hair. Space out hair washings as far as you can, and limit it to at least every other day.

, When you wash your face with cold water, it closes your pores and keeps them free of grime; your hair responds similarly when washed in cold water, by closing the cuticle of the hair and flattening out the scales. This makes your hair look better, makes it easier to manage, and keeps it healthier longer. Therefore, when you wash your hair use the coldest water you can tolerate and reap the benefits., Not all hair products are made the same, and there are many on the market that are specifically for use in lengthening and thickening hair. Look for these as well as anti-frizz products; frizzy hair can give the illusion of short, thin hair. When possible though, look for hair products that contain all-natural or organic ingredients rather than harsh chemicals which could worsen your hair.

, Shampoo can be incredibly drying on your hair, which removes the helpful oils necessary for promoting hair growth. Find a shampoo that is sulfate-free for gentler hair care. Not only will your hair look better, you probably won’t have to wash it so often too.

, If you’ve ever used a rubber-band to tie up your hair, you know how damaging certain tools can be to your hair. Use only tug-friendly elastic bands and hair clips with rubber-ends. When possible, use only plastic combs that lack seams to brush your hair as other brushes can catch in your hair and yank out strands.

, You can stimulate your scalp into producing hair a bit faster by massaging it on a regular basis. Warm up some coconut oil until it is comfortable to the touch, and rub it into your scalp and the roots of your hair for 5-10 minutes. If you do this once a week for several months, you’ll notice a significant growth spurt in your hair.

, In an attempt to repair split ends and breakage along your strands, you can give yourself a deep-conditioning treatment. You can purchase one at a store, or do one at home using mayonnaise (yes, it sounds gross but it works really well). Rub the conditioning treatment into your hair and let it soak for 20-30 minutes. Rinse it out as per usual, and repeat the process once a month. As an additional benefit to speeding up the growing process, your hair will be much softer too.

Rinsing out your conditioner with cold water and finishing blow drying your hair with cold air will both seal the cuticle to lock away frizz and add shine.







, Certain hairstyles, such as small braids and tight buns, can tug and pull out hair, and cause breakage where the elastic bands sit. Mix up your hairstyles throughout the week so that the same area of hair isn’t constantly getting damaged, and avoid using any hairstyles that put a lot of pressure on your scalp., Certain vitamins and minerals can aid in supplying your body with nutrients essential to growing long, thick hair. Talk to your doctor first, but consider taking iron, vitamin D, zinc, and B-spectrum vitamins. There are also hair-growth specific vitamins out there like Biotin that aid solely in growing out your hair and nails., Yes, it is the advice we often don’t want to hear but nearly always get; exercise is beneficial to your health in dozens of ways, including thickening your hair and speeding up growth time. It works to increase circulation to your scalp, which is primarily responsible for hair growth. Try to exercise several times a week for the best results.

, Your hair needs certain nutrients to grow just like the rest of your body does! Good food helps supply your hair follicles with nutrients necessary for luscious, full looking strands; poor nutrition can lead to dull, lackluster, lanky hair. Fill up your diet with leafy greens, fresh fruit, wild-caught fish, and nuts and watch your hair grow more vibrant.

, Your body needs water to maintain its health and to continue growing, and so does your hair. Possibly the easiest change to make to benefit your hair is simply drinking more water! Try to consume 8-10 full glasses of fluids (preferably water) per day for the best results.

, If your hair is decently long already, you’re probably used to waking up with dozens of strands of hair spread out in your bed and on your pillows. Although it is natural to lose a few strands of hair every day, certain fabrics that you sleep on can grab more hair than is meant to be lost. To prevent this, switch over to silk pillowcases which don’t cause so much friction. Not interested in new pillowcases? Try wrapping your hair with a silk scarf at night instead., There’s a reason the old adage of losing your hair has to do with suffering from too much stress. Certain hormones are released when you are stressed which have a direct correlation to increased hair loss.Keep your hair thick and full (and do your emotions and mental state a favor!) by taking steps to reduce your stress. You’ll feel better in general, but your hair will look significantly healthier over time as well."

Add highlights or lowlights for added dimension.",How to Give Hair a Mirror Shine," For light colored hair, such as various shades of blond, keeping it clean is key to getting maximum shine. That’s because your hair looks dull when it’s greasy. Wash your hair at least every other day to keep your hair looking super shiny.If your light hair is dry, wash every other day to keep it shiny. Use a moisturizing shampoo and always follow up with conditioner.
If your light hair is fine or thin, you can usually wash every day. Use conditioner only on the ends of your hair to avoid making it greasy. You may also want to use a clarifying shampoo once or twice a month to remove any buildup that might dull your hair.;
, Dark colored hair tends to look its shiniest when it is properly hydrated. Shampooing your hair too often can actually strip the moisture from your hair and leave it looking dry. Wash your hair no more than every other day to boost its shine.If you have dry, dark hair, you may be able to go every two days between shampoos. Be sure to always use a conditioner when you wash to keep your hair hydrated.
If you have fine, dark hair, you should probably wash every other day. If your roots look greasy between washes, apply a dry shampoo to soak up the excess oil.

, Whenever you shampoo and condition your hair, it’s important to rinse your hair properly. Cool or cold water seals the cuticle so your hair appears smoother and shinier. Even if you wash with lukewarm water, give your hair one final rinse with cool water for extra shine.In a similar way, blasting your hair with cool air just before you finish blow drying it can help make it shinier.

, Dry, dehydrated hair always looks dull, so you must deep condition your hair regularly to keep it soft and shiny. Use a deep conditioner or moisturizing hair mask weekly or monthly for shiny hair.If you have dry or damaged hair, apply your deep conditioning treatment once a week.
If you have fine or thin hair, apply your deep conditioning treatment once a month.

, Hair gloss is a topcoat for your hair that adds major shine. You can have it done at the salon, but there are also at-home treatments that are easy to apply. In most cases, you simply apply the formula to your hair after shampooing and conditioning, let it sit for a few minutes, and rinse it out.Pay careful attention to the instructions on your at-home kit to ensure that you don’t damage your hair.
Most gloss treatments last 2 to 4 weeks. You can usually use them once or twice a month.
You can find clear gloss treatments that work for all hair colors, as well as those that are designed for specific hair colors. They usually deposit some color in addition to the gloss, so be sure that you’re using one for the correct hair shade.

, You might not give too much thought to the kind of brush that you use, but the right one can actually boost your hair’s shine. Always use a brush with natural bristles -- they are more gentle and help distribute your hair’s natural oils for shinier hair.Avoid brushes with synthetic bristles because they’re too rough and may lead to hair breakage.

, Heat styling your hair too often isn’t good for your locks, but strategic straightening can boost its shine. Flat ironing your hair seals and smooths the cuticle so it reflects the light for major shine.For the most intense shine, use a flat iron whose plates are infused with an oil such as argan.

, When you’re done styling your hair, you can add more shine by using the right finishing product. A hair oil or a shine spray can give your hair a little more shine no matter how you’ve styled it. Use it as the final step of your hair routine.If you have fine or thin hair, choose a lightweight oil, such as avocado or macadamia nut oil, or shine mist instead so it doesn’t leave behind much buildup.
If you have thick or dry hair, choose a heavier oil, such as argan or babassu oil, or a shine serum to boost the shine.

, Heat can quickly strip your hair of moisture, leaving it dull and flat. To keep your locks shiny, protect it from heat styling, such as blow drying, straightening, or curling, as well as environmental factors, such as the sun, saltwater, and chlorine.Always apply a heat protectant spray before blow drying, flat ironing, or curling your hair. It coats your strands with extra moisture so the styling tool doesn’t dry out your locks.
Use a hairspray with SPF whenever you’re going to spend time outside. If you’re going to be in the sun for a prolonged period, wear a wide-brimmed hat to cover your hair.
Before you go swimming in the ocean or a pool, wet your hair with fresh water or a leave-in conditioner. That will prevent your hair from absorbing the ocean or pool water, which can dry out your hair.

, Omega-3 fatty acids help keep your hair soft and shiny by keeping it hydrated. Incorporate foods that are high in these fatty acids to ensure that your hair maintains its shine.Foods that are high in omega-3 fatty acids include salmon, tuna, walnuts, egg yolks, soybeans, and spinach.
You can also take an omega-3 fatty acid supplement that provides 1 gram a day. Just be sure to talk to your doctor before starting any supplements.

, Hair that features both dark and light shades tends to look shinier than hair that’s all one color. Incorporating highlights or lowlights to your hair can help it reflect more light and boost its shine.If you have a blonde base, ask your stylist about adding lowlights throughout your hair to give it more dimension.
If you have dark hair, ask your stylist about adding thin highlights to incorporate lighter tones in your hair.

Wash your hair less.,
Shampoo properly.,
Condition when you shampoo.,
Comb your hair carefully.,
Dry your hair naturally.",How to Grow Healthy Long Hair As Quickly as Possible1," You eliminate the naturally produced oils when you rub shampoo through your hair.These oils protect your hair shafts and moisturize your scalp.


When you send processed chemicals through your hair, you break it down and prevent it from growing out in a healthy fashion. Think of it like obsessively washing your hands. The more you wash, the drier and more cracked they become.
You don't need to stop washing your hair entirely. Start by washing every other day. Once you get used to this, you can wash every three days. This schedule is recommended in solidifying good hair health.;
, When you wash your hair, make sure that you aren't damaging it. Overuse of shampoo can crack your hair and make your split ends worse.








Shampoo your scalp only, being careful not to scrub the ends of your hair. The soap will slide down your ends when you rinse, cleaning them without excessive force. Harshly scrubbing the ends themselves will deteriorate your hair.
Some people think that you have to change your shampoo often. According to experts, it's better to stick with a product that works for you.
If you have oily hair or use product, you might want to break up your routine with a clarifying shampoo. Stronger shampoos wash away extra residue left behind from oil or overuse of products.

, While shampooing too often will damage your hair, most conditioners replenish lost lipids and proteins.Whenever your hair is wet, you'll want to condition it.









Any dye or heat application strips your hair of these essential lipids and proteins. The strands toward the base of your hair grow weaker over time. You want to bolster them again.
You'll also seal the cuticle at the end of hair. This prevents future damage from occurring. If you can fight these issues, your hair will stay healthy and strong for a longer period of time.

, Studies show that any irritation or inflammation to the scalp can greatly damage the health of your hair.Some people don't notice their hair damage until it begins to fall out. You want to avoid this fate by taking care of your scalp now.









It's dangerous to aggressively comb or brush your hair at any point. When it's wet, however, your hair is even more vulnerable. Pulling on it will put physical stress on your hair fiber, as well as leading to flaking in the protective cuticle.
Use a wide-tooth comb and begin brushing from the bottom, rather than the top. This prevents breakage.

, Rushing to dry your hair quickly can be very problematic, and it's a major way to damage its health. Blow drying, like any ""flash drying"" method, will fry the surface moisture on your hair.Unfortunately, it will also dry out the water bound to your hair, otherwise known as the ""water of hydration.""









Sucking out this water will make your cuticles dry, rigid, and brittle. This causes your cuticles to crack, leading to more significant breakage.
You also want to avoid putting your hair in a towel. Any time you wrap wet hair up tightly, you damage it. Even rubbing your hair dry with a towel can cause your hair to deteriorate.
If you do need to dry your hair quickly, wrap it in a soft microfiber towel or a cotton tee-shirt.

Trim your split ends.,
Apply an oil treatment.,
Switch to a softer pillowcase.",How to Grow Healthy Long Hair As Quickly as Possible2," Contrary to popular belief, trimming your split ends doesn't actually make your hair grow any faster.The follicles in your scalp determine the speed at which your hair will grow. When you trim your split ends, you ensure that your new locks are as healthy as possible.









The ends of your hair are the oldest part of your hair and have the most broken follicles, as they are most affected by coloring, curling, and straightening. When you trim the ends, you'll shed these damaged parts. This gives more room for healthy hair to grow in.
When your hair grows longer, your cuticle grows weaker and breaks. This leaves the middle strands of your hair unprotected, and your split ends move higher up your hair. Prevent this by taking care of unhealthy split ends quickly.

, There are many oil treatments that improve the health of your hair. You can buy these natural oils at your local health or vitamin store.By applying one of these treatments weekly, you'll promote the healthy growth of new hair.









Coconut oil contains a large amount of Vitamin E. Vitamin E strengthens your roots by improving your body's circulation. Your hair will grow in much thicker and shinier.
Argan oil, while quite expensive, contains a large variety of nutrients that will improve the strength and flow of your hair.
Extra-virgin olive oil, the same oil that you use to dress salads, improves scalp health and fights bacteria.
Make sure that you're properly applying these oil treatments. Massage a bit of oil, either room temperature or slightly warmer, into your roots and scalp. Let it pass down your tips like you would with any condition.
Slip on a shower cap and let the oil sit for about half an hour, then wash and rinse normally.

, While we often sleep on cotton pillows, the coarser texture of cotton mats your hair while you sleep, causing it to tangle.If you allow your hair to rub against this cotton, your hair will become damaged and unhealthy.


Silk fabrics compare very closely to the structure of human hair, containing 97% amino acids and 3% waxy and fat fibers.
Satin pillowcases are cheaper than silk pillowcases and also benefit the health of your hair.Cotton pillowcases drain moisture from your hair. This will make your hair coarser, drying it out and making it brittle.

Try hair-boosting vitamins.,
Eat more protein.,
Incorporate Omega-3 acids into your diet.,
Drink more water.",How to Grow Healthy Long Hair As Quickly as Possible3," Having a healthy dose of vitamins in your diet will improve your overall health. You can also purchase certain vitamins that lead directly to improving the health of your hair. Research products specifically for your hair type to find what will work best for you.Most of these vitamins can be incorporated into your eating routine naturally, if they aren't included in it already.


Biotin, otherwise known as Vitamin H, improves the health of your hair. It increases your hair's elasticity and moisturizes dryness. This will prevent breaking. You can find biotin in brown rice, lentils, oats, among other foods.
Vitamin A helps produce healthy sebum, an oily substance released by your scalp. Sebum helps prevent dryness. Do not overload on Vitamin A, however, as an excess of it can actually lead to hair loss.
Vitamin E promotes healthy skin while improving your body's blood circulation. This vitamin increases your body's ability to intake oxygen. Having a steady flow of oxygen into your body will aid your body in producing new hair cells.

, In addition to strengthening your hair, more protein in your diet will improve your inner health. When your body digests protein, it breaks it down into smaller amino acids.These will aid in the construction of new body tissues, antibodies, hormones, enzymes, and blood cells.


Meats like steak, chicken, and fish contain healthy protein and amino acids. If you're a vegetarian, you can get your protein from tofu, beans, nuts, and legumes. These foods also replenish other vitamins crucial to healthy hair growth.
Protein is necessary for tissue repair. Your cells need amino acids to remain intact and healthy. Protein is the active substance in repairing broken cells, so having it in your diet will help replenish dead skin and hair cells.

, While they're tough to come by, Omega-3 fatty acids are vital to improving your inner health. Good fatty acids in your diet will lower triglyceride levels, reducing your risk for heart disease.Researchers have found that high levels of Omega-3 acids may also lead to lower levels of depression. Fish oil may even boost the effectiveness of certain anti-depression medication.
While you can get Omega-3 acids from supplements, you should incorporate them into your diet. Many types of fish, including salmon, herring, and mackerel, contain high levels of healthy fatty acid.
For vegetarians, get your Omega-3 acids from walnuts and flaxseed. Canola and soybean oils also contain these acids.

, Because so much of our body is made of water, the amount that you drink reflects in your healthy skin and hair.You want to make sure that you're properly purifying your water, so you aren't getting unwanted toxins.


If you're exercising regularly, you need to replenish the water that you lose through sweat. Pay attention to the color of your urine. A pale yellow or colorless stream will prove that you're drinking a healthy amount.
Drinking water will flush out toxins in your body. Drink at least eight cups a day, or a cup for every twenty pounds of your body weight.
A lack of water will dry up your hair. You will be left unwanted frizziness, and the healthy growth of your hair will be halted

Change the way you wash your hair.,
Dry your hair gently.,
Don't use harsh chemicals on your hair.,
Try all-natural hair styling techniques and products.,
Use a mask on your hair once every two weeks.,
Protect your hair from external damage.",How to Get Longer Hair Fast1," Factors like how often you wash your hair and what water temperature you use can affect the length of your hair. That's because washing your hair too often (think every day) and using super hot water will cause it to dry out and become brittle. That leads to hair breakage, preventing your hair from growing long and thick. The solution? Wash your hair no more than 3 times a week, and use the coldest water you can handle.


At first, washing your hair less often might make it look a little greasy. Wear a hat for a few days until your scalp gets used to producing less oil and things balance out. It shouldn't take long!
If you hate showering in cold water, try washing your hair in the sink with cold water separately from your regular showers. When you shower, keep your hair wrapped up in a shower cap.;
, Do you towel dry your hair roughly, brush it out, and blow it dry? You're breaking your hair! It won't get the chance to grow long and strong, because you're handling it too roughly while it's wet. Think of your hair like a garment made of good fabric; you wouldn't just throw it in the dryer, you'd carefully lay it out to gently air dry. Treat your hair with the same gentle care. After washing, gently pat it dry with a towel and let it finish air drying.


Don't brush your hair while it's wet. Wet hair tends to stretch and break more easily than dry hair. If you need to detangle it, use your fingers and a wide-toothed comb to gently work through the tangles.
Don't blow dry your hair except for special occasions. Blow drying often really does cause damage in the form of breakage, frizz and split ends, and it's not easy to repair; you just have to wait for fresh hair to grow out.

, The shampoo and conditioner you use may be contributing to poor hair growth. Most commercial shampoos contain sulfates, which strip your hair of its natural oils and leave it susceptible to damage. Conditioners contain silicones that coat the hair with chemicals and need to be washed out with more strong shampoo. This cycle is really damaging to hair! Here's what you can do instead:


Give your hair one last wash with a strong shampoo, to get rid of any remaining silicones. Don't condition it this time; just gently detangle it and let it air dry.
Give your hair a break for a few days. Don't do anything to it - don't wash it, straighten it, or use any products.
Next time you wash your hair, use an all-natural shampoo. Read the label and use a shampoo that contains only natural oils and other cleansers, no chemicals. You could even try going shampoo free!
Condition with diluted apple cider vinegar. This really works, and when it dries you won't smell like vinegar at all. For a deep-conditioning treatment, try using coconut oil. You'll never want to go back to the chemical-laden stuff you used before.

, In a similar vein, start using gentler methods when it comes to styling your hair. Use heating tools like curling irons, straighteners, and of course hair dryers only sparingly. Switch out chemical-filled hairsprays and gels for natural versions. This gives your hair the chance to grow long and strong, taking on its own unique, beautiful texture.


You can make your own hair gel from non-harmful ingredients.
To smooth flyaways and frizz, apply a little argan oil or another cosmetic oil to your hair, rather than using an over-the-counter product.
Try natural methods to curl your hair without heat or to straighten it without heat.

, This will help repair any damage that's been done to it by replenishing your hair's moisture. Afterward your hair will feel soft, silky and healthy, and it'll stay healthy long enough to keep growing out.


Try a hot oil mask using coconut and almond oil, as coconut oil has high penetration and deep conditioning power while almond oil adds extra shine to the weak dry hair. Massage the oil into your hair and put on a shower cap. Run a warm blow dryer over the cap for about 10 minutes, then remove the cap and wash your hair. Alternatively, apply the hair mask and braid your hair then put it in a bun and put a shower cap on. Keep your hair braided for at least day and night for three months and you hair will grow 1-3 inches more than normal hair growth.
You could also try using warm olive oil, cinnamon and honey - this lightens your hair as it conditions it.

, Cover it up when you spend long hours in the sun, swim in a chlorinated pool, or hang out where there's a high level of air pollution. Your hair can get damaged by repeated exposure to these elements, so tie it up in a scarf, wear a hat or swim cap, and make sure to use gentle washing and drying methods afterward to keep it healthy.

, When you know what type of hair you have, you are better able to keep it healthy by meeting its needs. You can discover your hair type by gauging its density, texture, and strength.Density: Look at a patch of hair on the top of your head. If you can barely see your scalp through your hair, you have thick-density hair; if the hair is more spaced out, it’s of a fine density; and if it’s somewhere in the middle, your hair is of a medium density.Also, the thinner your part line, the higher the density.
Texture: Observe an individual strand of your hair. How thick or thin is the strand in relation to the hair of other people you know? You can also gauge how thick or fine your hair is by tugging on it — thick-textured hair will be stronger/less likely to break than fine-textured hair.Fine hair feels more flexible and can have difficulty holding volume while thicker hair tends to be stubborn and full.
Strength: Hair strength is measured by porosity and elasticity. Wash and towel-dry your hair, then feel it: if your hair feels quite wet, it’s more damaged/porous; if it feels quite dry, it’s healthier/less porous. The farther you can stretch your hair without it breaking, the more elastic and healthy it is.,


There are myriad products to choose from — just be sure to choose something that suits your hair. In general, salon brands are thought to be of a higher quality than drugstore brands.

Pay close attention to the instructions on the bottle. A protein-based conditioner, for instance, will strengthen your hair, but can make it brittle if left on too long.

, If you can’t afford to buy expensive salon conditioning treatments, and you’d rather not use drugstore brands, you can pamper your hair at home with the following treatment:Massage your scalp and the ends of your hair with some warm oil. Options for oil include coconut, olive, and sweet almond, among others.
Which oil you use will depend on your hair type and personal preference.Jojoba oil is a safe bet for all hair types.Wrap a hot, damp towel around your head. This will help the oil penetrate your hair. Just make sure it’s not too hot!Apply a hair mask to your hair. The type of mask will depend on your hair type. For dry hair, apply a paste of 1 or 2 egg whites and honey to your hair; for greasy hair, apply a paste of aloe vera gel, amla powder, and water to your hair., Washing your hair too often robs your hair and scalp of their natural oils, making your hair look dull.Washing your hair too vigorously can also cause damage, so be gentle.


How often you wash your hair will depend on your individual hair. Some people find that they need to wash their hair every day or two to keep it from getting too oily; others are able to wash their hair once or twice a week.
When washing your hair, be gentle: massage the shampoo into your roots and then let it move down through the rest of your hair — don’t rub it into your hair, as this can cause damage., When your hair is wet it’s more fragile and prone to breakage. After washing your hair, dry it gently by wrapping it or squeezing it with a towel, rather than rubbing it vigorously with one.Wait for your hair to dry a bit before brushing it; when you do brush it, use a wide-tooth comb.

, The popular advice of “100 strokes a day” is wrong. Brushing your hair too much can actually cause split ends and breakage.You also need to be careful about what kind of brush you use. Wide-tooth combs are commonly recommended by stylists as the most gentle option.Boar bristle brushes may be the exception to this rule since they are much easier on the hair and can help distribute your hair's natural oils as well.

, This includes flat-ironing/straightening, blow-drying, and curling your hair. These things can make your hair look dull; with regular use over time, they can cause permanent damage.If you must heat-style your hair, be sure to coat your hair in a protective spray or balm before applying heat.Most hair types should only use the low or medium settings and be sure to only style each section once. If curling, roll the hair up and clip while it cools. You can also create curls with set setting techniques like rollers or pin curls.

, Doing this can cause your hair to break, particularly if you pull your hair too tightly while styling it. In more extreme cases, hair can even fall out: this is called traction alopecia.If you do put your hair in a ponytail use clothe covered elastics and never rubber bands.
Be especially careful about putting your hair into a ponytail or braid when it’s wet and more prone to damage.
The same goes for extensions and weaves, which can pull on you hair. If you have discomfort or pain in your scalp, your hair is likely causing too much pressure on your roots., The sun’s UV rays can bleach your hair, causing it to become dry and brittle. You’re not much safer in the rain, which can deposit harmful chemicals into your hair.To protect your hair in the sun, wear a hat or spritz it with a UV-protecting spray. Some leave-in conditioners also provide UV protection.
To protect your hair in the rain, use an umbrella or a hat, or wear waterproof jacket with a hood.

, The chlorine in pools can irritate your skin and scalp, and make your hair dry and brittle.Before you get in the water, get your hair damp, slather on a protective product, and cover it with a swimming cap.


Recommended products for protecting your hair from chlorine include those containing oil and/or silicone or, for a more natural option, coconut oil.If you swim regularly, you may also want to invest in a hair cleanser that’s specially designed to wash out chlorine., Resist the urge to tame your damaged locks with a tonne of conditioning and frizz-reducing products, which can leave your hair looking weighed down and oily.


When using hair products, less is more. Start small and add additional product as needed. A small dab of anti-frizz cream/gel is often enough to tame fly-aways without making your hair look oily.

, Hair that has been dyed, permed, straightened and/or relaxed is more likely to be thin, dull, and prone to breakage., In general, a healthy diet consists of lots of fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, healthy fats, and the avoidance of processed foods. Here are some key foods to eat for healthy hair:Fish such as salmon, sardines, and mackerel contain omega-3 fatty acids, which protect you from disease and help your body grow and maintain healthy, shiny hair.
Greek yogurt contains protein and vitamin B5 (also known as pantothenic acid), which are both essential for healthy hair growth. If you don’t get enough protein in your diet, your hair growth stalls.Dark leafy greens such as spinach and kale contain vitamin A, iron, beta carotene, folate, and vitamin C, which are all helpful in maintaining a healthy scalp and hair. Vitamin C in particular is hugely helpful in preventing breakage.
Sweet potatoes and other orange fruits and vegetables such as carrots, pumpkins, cantaloupe, and mangoes contain the antioxidant beta carotene, which helps keep hair hydrated and shiny.
Cinnamon and other spices boost your circulation, helping to deliver oxygen and nutrients to your hair follicles. Sprinkle blood-flow-boosting spices into your various meals and beverages.
Eggs are a great source of protein, iron, and biotin — a B vitamin that helps with hair growth.

, In addition to making you tired, unfocused, and depressed, an iron deficiency can cause hair loss.If you think you might not be getting enough iron in your diet, try eating fortified cereal, grains, and pastas.
You can also find iron in soybeans, lentils, shellfish, dark leafy greens, beef, and organ meats like liver., If you are dehydrated you are likely to have a drier scalp and dull, dry hair.Aim to drink roughly half your body weight (in pounds) in ounces of water each day.


Example: a 150-pound woman would drink at least 75 ounces of water each day — more if she were active or living in a hot climate (i.e. if she were sweating).

, Stress can lead to hair loss.To help reduce stress, work on exercising regularly, sleeping at least 7 hours each night (8.5 hours if you’re a teenager), and doing things that help you relax.


Some things that may help you relax include meditation, socializing with people who make you feel good, taking baths, or taking up a fun hobby (e.g., book club, music, dance, recreational sports).

, In addition to being good for you generally, workouts are also good for your hair. Exercise can help increase circulation, release protective sebum from the scalp, and sweating can help release dirt or any dead skin that might clog your follicles., If your hair is thinning or otherwise damaged, and there’s no obvious reason for it (i.e. you’re not bleaching your hair regularly or constantly frying it with heat styling tools), see a doctor to rule out any potential health problems. Some health problems that can lead to hair loss/damage:Overactive or underactive thyroid
Other hormonal problems
Anemia/iron deficiency
Exposure to harmful chemicals
Severe infections
Side effects of certain medications

Apply milk thoroughly throughout your hair.,
Wait at least 30 minutes.,
Take a shower.,
Wash your hair.,

Do not use product on your hair daily.,
Continue using milk as a conditioner.",How to Get Good Looking Hair (Milk Conditioning)," Milk conditioning can be used with just milk, but you can also use other items in your pantry for a natural hair mask to get beautiful, shiny hair.


For regular milk conditioning, whole milk works best. You can use lowfat milk for fine hair, and cream for very coarse hair. Put it in a small spray bottle and spray over your hair, waiting 30 minutes before washing it out with shampoo.;
, Adding honey can seal moisture in your hair, and is a fan favorite for the combination conditioner. Milk-and-honey conditioner works great repairing damaged hair.


Combine two cups of warm whole milk with two teaspoons of honey and stir until combined. Pour it over your hair and let it sit for 30 minutes.

, Coconut milk can be used with essential oils to create a mask to fix dry hair. For this recipe, you may want to purchase essential oils to add to your mixture, if you desire.


Refrigerate one can of unsweetened coconut milk overnight, before applying it to dry hair starting at the roots. Let it sit for 20 minutes before you rinse and comb the coconut milk out.

, When used properly, food and fruits can be used to create mixtures to treat your hair. Foods and fruits like bananas, avocados and olive oil can all be combined to treat dry, damaged and frizzy hair.


Blend one banana with one tablespoon of your choice of olive oil, coconut oil or almond oil. Once the combination reaches a paste-like substance, you can apply it to your hair and leave it for 30 minutes before shampooing and conditioning as usual.
Mash up a whole avocado with 1-2 teaspoons of olive oil and apply to all parts of your hair. Secure in a loose bun with a shower cap and leave it for 30 minutes, before rinsing in the shower with shampoo and conditioner.

, Since you're using milk conditioning for your hair, you may be interested in exchanging the harsh chemicals in your shampoo with all-natural ingredients as well. Eggs and apple cider vinegar are great options for mixing shampoos.Separate two egg yolks from their whites, and whisk the yolks before applying them to your hair. If you'd like to leave them in for several minutes, you can whisk the yolks with one tablespoon of mayonnaise for a pre-treating cream.
Apple cider vinegar is a good tool to mix with water while you're in the shower to use in lieu of shampoo. You can use 1/2-1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar with one cup of water, doubling these measurements to cover the length of your hair., Using the spray bottle, spray some milk evenly throughout your hair. If you'd like, you can use a brush to brush it through your hair, but you may need to spray some more.


Try to use a clean brush and make sure to clean and remove any hairs after every use.Milk-hair in your brush will go bad quickly and easily develop bacteria that could get you sick.

, Allow your hair to absorb the milk for the best results.You should apply the milk product with plenty of time before your shower. For thicker and longer hair, you may want to wait longer than 30 minutes.


Try not to let your hair sit for too long without washing. You don't want any accidental stickiness to develop in your hair.

, It's time to wash all that milk out of your hair. Prepare a shower as normal, with your towel ready for when you get out. Hot showers may be comfortable, but they could cause damage to the hair you're trying to strengthen and repair.


Taking cold showers refines hair and skin, and if you're trying to use all-natural ingredients for your healthy hair, it can be a great addition to your hair care., Although it may seem scary to wash out the natural ingredients that you're using to strengthen and shine your hair, the truth is you have to wash out the milk and any the ingredients you may have used. The treatment set in your hair while you waited 30 minutes before showering, so if you don't wash it, you'll just end up with sticky, smelly hair.


You can use other natural ingredients in lieu of shampoo. A beaten egg can be applied from your scalp through the length of your hair, and leave it in for a few minutes while you take the rest of your shower., Even if you style your hair while it's wet, you'll need to pat-dry the significant wetness in your hair. Make sure there are no droplets coming from the ends of your hair before you style or blow dry it.


Blow-drying, straightening and curling your hair causes heat damage to your locks.Milk and honey can help repair this damage, but it still might not be a great idea to use these hair styling products every single day.

, If you can, avoid styling with heat products. Heat can cause damage to your hair if you use it too much.


Also avoid brushing wet hair. Wet hair is much more easily damaged than dry hair.Try using your fingers to remove tangles, as this may actually help strengthen your hair.

, Your hair actually contains natural oils that are stripped when you wash them. When the oils pile up, your hair gets oily which is not desired. But stripping your hair of its natural oils every day is equally as harmful to your scalp.


You should still clean your hair while you shower every day. Every now and then, you should bypass the shampooing process and focus on just water and friction from your hands, or solely conditioning., Maintain your hair's new silky smoothness by continuing the milk-conditioning process consistently. This can repair your hair over time and leave your hair deep-conditioned for longer.


There may be a time for a week or so after you stop using harsh chemical conditioner that your hair feels funky or oily. If you continue using milk conditioner, this transition period should go away.

Wash regularly, but not obsessively.,
Take your time.,
Try a few kinds of anti-dandruff shampoo.,
Reassess anti-dandruff shampoo if it makes things worse.",How to Get Rid of Dandruff at Home1," Wash your hair every other day with a dandruff shampoo until the flakes subside. After that, continue to wash your hair with the anti-dandruff shampoo 2-3 times per week. Frequent washing may seem like a good idea, but it can dry out your scalp and lead to more flakes., Massage the shampoo into your scalp thoroughly, and leave it in for at least 5 minutes before rinsing. This gives the shampoo time to work.


Be sure to rinse the shampoo out of your hair thoroughly, as dried shampoo flakes can look like dandruff, and may continue to irritate or dry out your scalp.

, There are a handful of different active ingredients that are found in various shampoos. If the one you are using is not helping or is loosing effectiveness, check the ingredients list on the back to see what the active ingredient is, and try a shampoo with a different one. Different shampoos work for different scalps. Anti-dandruff shampoos usually use one of five active ingredients: zinc pyrithione, tar, selenium sulfide, salicylic acid, or ketoconazole.


Zinc pyrithione shampoos combat the amount of seborrheic dermatitis causing fungus on your scalp.
Tar-based shampoos slow down how quickly your scalp’s skin cells die and flake.
Selenium sulfide shampoos, like tar-based shampoos, slow down how quickly your skin cells die. These shampoos can cause discoloration, and those with blonde, grey, or chemically colored hair may want to avoid them. At the very least, you should be sure to rinse thoroughly.
Salicylic acid shampoos help scrub away scales, but they can dry out your scalp, and should be used with moisturizing conditioner.
Ketoconazole shampoos contain a particularly effective antifungal agent, and are a good option when other shampoos have proved ineffective. They are available in both over-the-counter and prescription strength varieties.

, Many people think “dandruff” simply means having a flaky scalp, but true dandruff is caused by a fungal infection. Anti-dandruff shampoos are designed to help fight this fungus, not moisturize skin, and they may actually make your dry scalp drier. If you have tried a couple different anti-dandruff shampoos and/or home remedies and found that they seem to only make matters worse, try switching to a normal moisturizing shampoo for a week or two, and see if it helps.If you have tried many methods without any success, consult a dermatologist. You may need a prescription strength shampoo.

Add shine to thinning hair.",How to Get Shiny Hair4," Untreated curly, coarse and kinky hair has bends and turns that refract light instead of reflecting it.

These treatments will boost moisture, smooth the cuticle and reflect light.Try an an apple cider vinegar rinse. ACV smooths the cuticle, causing your hair to look more shiny. Add two tablespoons to a cup of water and rinse your hair after shampooing.

, In the quest for shiny hair, many people blow out and straighten their tresses every single day. Over time this will cause hair to break and become frayed. If you want your hair to look shiny and healthy again, it's time to give the heat a break.


Let your hair air dry for several months. Put away your heat styling tools and vow to give your hair a chance to repair itself.
Focus on conditioning your hair. Use deep conditioning treatments, hydrating masks, and a boar bristle brush to help restore your hair's health. This will reduce frizz and lead to shinier locks.

Focus on the tips, which tend to dry out faster than the rest of your hair., When your hair is thinning, it's important to treat it very gently if you want it to look healthy and shiny. Your goal is to add shine and volume without causing further damage to your hair.


Let your hair air dry on most days so you don't make thinning worse by damaging your hair with heat styling tools. As your hair dries, use clips around your head to lift the roots of your hair away from your scalp. This will add volume without using a hair dryer.
Curl your hair without heat. Use cloth or rag curling methods instead of a curling iron or hot rollers. This way you can gently add volume to your hair without causing damage or hair loss.
Finish with a light serum. A heavy leave-in conditioner, gel or mousse will weigh down thinning hair. To add shine and retain volume, use a very light oil or serum. Aloe vera gel is a great option. You can even make your own hair spray using aloe as your base.Keep shine products restricted to your ends with thin hair, as applying them near the scalp can make hair appear thinner.

These factors all create your unique hair type and dictate what products and hair care procedures would work best for you.If you know your hair type (straight, curly, dry, thin, color treated, etc.), finding specific hair products at the store should be easy. Use the products that correlate with the type of hair you have. Nearly every hair care brand has multiple versions of their product to fit customers' different hair needs. It is best to determine your hair type when your hair is in it's most natural state.
If you don't know your hair type, or your hair spans over a few different types, you can always ask your hairdresser for some advice the next time you get your hair cut or treated.
If you have dyed hair, look for products specifically made for color treated hair. These specialized products usually have moisturizing benefits since hair dyes contain harsh chemicals that dry out hair. These products will also help maintain color and luster of treated hair.;
, You want to use products made for the kind of hair that you have, so you can easily control and style your hair in a way that works best with your hair type. For example, if you have oily hair, you're going to want to avoid shampoos that add moisture, and instead look for products that help with balancing or clarifying.



Curly or coarse hair should look for products that reduce frizz, and depending on how your want to style your hair, look for products that are curl defining or curl softening.

Flat or thin hair should look for products that add volume but are also gentle for washing. Since oil shows more easily on people with thin hair, they might have to wash their hair more frequently.

Colored or treated hair should try to use products specifically made for color treated hair for two reasons: first, these products have amino acids and conditioners that help fortify the already damaged hair. Second, these specific products are more gentle on your hair so your hair can retain the color. There are many reasons that hair color fades (sun exposure, adding on chemicals from further treatments, chlorine, etc.), but shampooing is the biggest culprit because people shampoo so regularly., Hairdressers are used to working with many different hair types each day, so they might have some helpful insight on what products would work well with your hair (especially if you have been a long time customer and they are very familiar with your hair). They can offer a variety of brands ranging from salon products to products that can be found in your local grocery store.

, Many people shampoo their hair every day when they shower, but in reality, shampooing hair every day can cause more harm than good. Your hair creates natural oils to keep the your hair naturally hydrated. Daily shampooing can strip your hair of these natural oils, causing your scalp to overproduce oil to compensate for the oil being washed away. A good rule of thumb is to try and shampoo hair between 2-4 times a week.









In place of washing your hair with shampoo, you can try simply rinsing your hair with water to freshen up your look, or use a dry shampoo between shampoo uses to lessen the look of greasy hair.

, Many people simply lather the shampoo all over their hair, but an important key in attaining beautiful hair goes beyond applying the shampoo, and includes taking care of the scalp. This involves massaging the scalp while shampooing. Massaging the scalp can help relieve stress and bring more blood flow to the area, promoting hair growth and strengthening the roots of the hair.








, Too often, people overuse the amount of shampoo they need. People who have medium to long hair should use about a quarter sized amount of shampoo. People who have medium to short hair should use about a nickel sized amount.

, It is best to wash with lukewarm or cool water because hot water strips moisture from your hair and dries it out. The cooler water is gentler on your hair and helps to seal in shine.








, Squeeze out the water remaining in your hair after you're finished shampooing. You want your hair to be relatively dry before you apply conditioner, because excess water can prevent conditioner from penetrating the hair and supplying its hydration.








, Again, the amount of conditioner depends on the length of your hair, but more often than not, a nickel sized amount is sufficient. The ends of your hair are the furthest from your oil-producing scalp. They tend to be the driest, and therefore need the most attention with conditioner.









Leave the conditioner in for 2-5 minutes. This time allows your hair to absorb the conditioner.
You can make use of this time by washing the rest of your body or shaving.

, Not everyone has a hair type that is conducive to frequent brushing, but if you do, it is important to brush your hair a few times throughout the day to keep it from getting tangled. This will ensure silky smooth hair for the majority of the day.









After showering, it is best to comb hair instead of brushing. Brushing wet hair can cause breakage because wet hair is more fragile than dry hair. Combs are easier on the hair while also being effective in removing tangles.
It is important to keep brushes clean by removing accumulated hair in the bristles. To clean your brush, simply remove the hair within the bristles along with any leftover product, and scrub the brush with either a mixture of baking soda and water, or a small amount of shampoo and water.

, Excessive heat (from blow dryers, flat irons, curling irons, rollers, etc.) can damage hair and cause breakage and dryness. Try using heated tools every other day rather than daily.

, Use a heat protecting spray or treatment when using hot hair tools. These protective treatments will help add and maintain moisture to your hair while acting as a barrier to the damaging heat. Be sure to pay special attention to the ends of your hair, which tend to receive most direct heat.

, Drying your hair with a towel can help save time and energy wasted by blow drying hair that is dripping wet. Also, allowing your hair to dry naturally before you start blow drying can also keep your hair from being exposed to additional and unnecessary heat.

, Again, applying heat can be very damaging to hair, so use the medium to low settings for drying and styling. The air used to dry your hair should be at a temperature where you can comfortable blow air into the back of your hand and it doesn't cause discomfort.

, Blow dry your hair from a distance of about 2-3 inches. This lessens the direct contact with the heat on your hair and helps to ensure that you aren't scorching your scalp or hair. Also, point the dryer down onto your hair instead of pointing it directly on the side of your head. This will help reduce frizz.

, These haircuts do not have to be drastic, but to maintain healthy hair free from split ends, it is important to cut off the split ends before they have a chance to split further and travel up the rest of the strand of hair. This will help your hair look and feel all around healthy.

, Elastic hair ties are extremely helpful for keeping hair out of the way while playing sports, taming wild manes, and quickly pulling your hair out of your way, but they can also be rough on your hair. The elastic ties can pull on your hair strands (especially when you tie your hair back really tight), and this tight pulling can cause hair to break. Instead of tying your hair up in tight ponytails or taut buns, try using headbands, scrunchies, or bobby pins to put back your hair without causing as much damage.

, Deep conditioning once a week or a couple times a month is great way to sustain smooth and hydrated hair. There are many deep conditioners that you can buy at the store, but there are other homemade alternatives as well. If you're looking to add moisture and softness to your hair, you should look for deep conditioners that have cetyl, stearyl, and cetearyl. If you are trying to strengthen your hair, you should look for ingredients like keratin, amino acids, hydrolyzed proteins, and henna.When you apply your deep conditioner, you should expect to keep it on for 5-30 minutes. This gives your hair time to absorb the nutrients and hydration properties of the conditioner.

Look for products that contain ceramides. Ceramides are an important, natural lipid that are stripped from the hair during the bleaching process. Color treated hair absorbs and retains these oils better than natural hair, because it’s replenishing what your hair is missing., Straighteners and curling irons are hard on healthy hair. Do not use on bleached hair if possible., If you must use hot styling tools, use hair products that protect against damage caused by high temperatures.There are heat protecting sprays, mists, creams and gels. Find what works best for you based on how you style your hair and what’s in your price range.

This protects against the damage of shampooing.Use oil in your hair after showering to do the same thing. It makes the hair appear soft and shiny.
After the shower, use oil sparingly. Part your hair into a top and bottom section. For fine hair, use one drop of oil per section, for thicker hair add a drop as needed. Coarse hair can need up to five drops.

, Hair damage isn’t all self inflicted. Every day, we deal with things which damage hair, and they are unfortunately unavoidable. Things like pollution, UVA/UVB rays and even your A/C and heater.Most hair protectants are for heat. Look for products that protect against heat, sun and weather. Since your hair is already rough, look for a product that also repairs damage., Split ends are almost guaranteed when bleaching your hair. If left unattended, a split end can split all the way up the hair shaft, making your hair look and feel straw-like. The best way to avoid further damage created by split ends is to have your hair trimmed every 4 to 6 weeks.To save yourself money between salon visits, you can learn to Cut Your Own Hair.This is a good option for small trims between salon visits. Continue to consult a professional at least every six months.

Blonde color has the tendency to turn brassy, and choosing a sulfate-free shampoo & conditioner is the easiest step toward avoiding that., An important aspect of maintaining your ideal blonde color is having purple shampoo and conditioner on hand.These products act as a toner by depositing purple color into your hair to neutralize any hair turned brassy and give your blonde a more natural look.These products can also dry out your hair, so limit use to once or twice a week.

, Because your head emits heat, it changes the way bleach develops on the hair closest to your scalp. Regular touch-ups also ensure an even color throughout your hair.When your darker hair starts growing in, don’t re-bleach your whole head of hair. Every time you bleach your hair, you are adding to the damage. Minimize this by only bleaching your newly grown, healthy roots."

Use hair clips to create volume.",How to Air Dry Thick Hair," Washing your hair strips away moisture, which leads to frizz. Try to shampoo your hair no more than a couple times a week. Simply rinse and apply conditioner to the ends on a daily basis. If you’re too intimidated by the thought of cutting out shampoo, try a cleansing conditioner that will gently remove oil while still moisturizing your hair. , When you apply shampoo, only lather up the hair around your scalp. It's the youngest and most oily area of your hair, while the ends are the oldest and driest, so they don't need the same amount of washing.Massage the shampoo into your roots with your fingers and then rinse it out.

, Use a wide-toothed comb to detangle your hair while it’s still wet. If you wait until it starts to dry, this can add to its frizziness.To help prevent breakage, try combing it while the conditioner is still in your hair, then rinse when you’re done.

, Once you’re done showering, gather your hair into a ponytail with your hands at the back of your head and move down the length of your hair, squeezing the water down as you go. This will help excess water run off the ends of your hair to prepare for the towel.

, Do not rub your hair vigorously with the towel. The friction of rubbing not only results in frizz but also breakage. Wrap the towel gently around your hair and squeeze it in various spots to absorb as much water as possible., Slide your fingers through your hair at the scalp, and then run them through your hair down to the ends. This allows the air to work through the hair, decreasing drying time.

, If you want defined curls or waves in your hair as it dries, try twisting several sections of hair around a finger and holding it for a few seconds to create spirals. For a beach waves look, apply an anti-frizz product and scrunch your hair up in your palm before releasing it.


Try wrapping your hair in a loose bun or creating several braids and securing them until your hair is dry. Once you take it back down, you’ll have more defined waves.

, Microfiber is more absorbent than a traditional towel, and it’s gentler on your hair since it doesn’t create the same sort of friction.If you don't have a microfiber towel, an old t-shirt will work as well. Just blot your hair with it the same way you would with a towel.

, Hairbrushes will only add frizz to your thick hair. Find a comb, preferably a wide-toothed one, and use it sparingly, such as only in the shower or when your hair is already wet. Avoid combing or brushing dry hair, especially if your hair is curly, since the resulting frizz could get out of control.

, Apply a detangler, serum, or oil suitable for your hair type to get silky, shiny hair. Try a gel-based product for straight hair and a cream or mousse for curly hair.Do not use products intended for blow drying as many of them are activated by the heat of the blow dryer.


To protect the ends of your hair, apply an anti-breakage serum to them while your hair is still wet.

, While your hair is still wet, saturate it with leave-in conditioner from root to tip, or just from the middle down if you're concerned about excess oil from your scalp. If you don’t have a leave-in conditioner, you can do the same thing with coconut oil, and allow the product to sit in your hair as it dries.This will help restore lost moisture to your hair and eliminate frizz.


Avoid overloading your hair with too many products, since this can make it stiff or greasy., If you want to add extra volume to your roots, gather a section of hair at a time and lift the hair up at the root before sliding a clip in. Do this several times around your part and the crown of your head. Then remove the clips once your hair is dry and enjoy the extra lift."

Prepare yourself and try to form a routine of showering in the afternoon (or the morning if you have a lot of time) and allowing hair to dry naturally.,
Comb hair before washing, to avoid nasty tangles and breakages.

,
Start the process with hot water - not scalding, however - and allow simply to drench hair and scalp.,
Shampoo hair thoroughly with a sulfate and sodium free shampoo - massaging the scalp and gently pulling wefts of hair taut with shampoo on your fingers are both ways of absolute deep-down cleansing.

,
Wash hair with warm water until water runs clear.,
Apply a LITTLE less conditioner than shampoo - Organix is a good brand - Remember, sulfate and sodium free - just to the TIPS (if your hair is oily), or to the mid-lengths downwards (if you have normal/dry hair).,
Rinse with cold water - this isn't too bad, once you're used to it!,
Pat hair dry with a warm towel.,
Apply anti-frizz serum to hair to keep it from become frizzy, even on the most humid of days.,

,, Repeat if necessary.

, Avoid the roots, but it is okay to apply leftover conditioner to them. Leave conditioner in while you wash your body, face, shave, etc, and rinse it out right before you get out of the shower so your hair can soak up the nutrients.

, Stand under cold water for as long as you can - this closes the shaft of the hair, adding deep-down natural shine. This is also beneficial for the face.

, After washing, let hair hang loose - Don't put it up, or you will get an unsightly dent in your hair where the elastic or clip was.

, Again, Organix has a very good anti-frizz serum.

, If you decide to use a fan, follow these steps.

, Both are fine to use on wet hair since they allow room for hair to slip from the teeth easily. Using a fan won't make your hair frizzy, because it covers your hair like a funnel which prevents frizz, and the cool air closes the shaft of the hair (don't worry, it won't give you a cold).

,, Look up tutorials on YouTube to get some ideas, and if you choose to use heat, make sure to use a good heat protecting serum!

, These can make your hair frizzy and discoloured, or simply damage it.

Secure it with a gentle hair band like a soft scrunchie or an elastic hair band so you do not break or damage your hair.Remove the band in the morning and run your fingers through your hair to loosen up your strands.


Let a half of an inch (1.27 cm) of your hair stick out beneath the hair tie so the tips of your hair will have a natural, relaxed look.Spray your locks with hairspray after removing the hair band.

, Hot rollers are a great way to style air dried hair to add volume. Pull a section of your hair taut and gently pull it up toward the ceiling. Leave the ends of your hair out, place the hot roller against your hair, and roll it gently toward your scalp. Place the ends of your hair beneath the roller once you have reached your scalp and secure it with the roller pin.The rollers should be left in your hair for 20 minutes.


After you have removed the rollers, gently work your fingers through your hair to loosen the curls, but don’t use a hairbrush. Brushing your hair can remove some of the volume. Secure your locks by using hairspray., Create voluminous hair by teasing your hair with a comb. Lift a 2 to 3 in (5 to 7.5 cm) wide section of your hair toward the ceiling with one hand as you hold the comb in the other.

Continue moving from section to section until you have reached the desired volume, and gently smooth out your hair with your hands or a bristled brush.Spray your hair with hairspray to maintain the volume throughout the day.
Don’t vigorously tease back and forth. This can break and tangle your hair., A simple way to add volume to your air dried hair is to switch your part. If you typically part your hair in the middle, try a side part. If you usually part it on the left, flip it to the right. Changing the part will change how the roots lie on your head, giving your hair an immediate and lift., A new haircut can help add volume to your hair.

Repeat once or twice a week.",How to Make Your Hair Silky and Shiny with Vinegar1," Plain vinegar is too strong to use on hair, so it's important to dilute it with water first. One-fourth cup of vinegar and one-fourth cup of water should be enough for a single hair rinse.


If your hair is quite oily, you can add an extra tablespoon of vinegar. If your hair is dry or you tend to have dandruff, add a tablespoon of water.
Curly hair and color treated or permed hair should be treated with a much more diluted solution, anywhere from 2 to 4 parts water to 1 part vinegar.
Either distilled white vinegar or apple cider vinegar work well here. Many prefer using apple cider vinegar in the shower because the smell is less intense.;
, Go ahead and wash your hair with your normal shampoo. If possible, use lukewarm or cool water. Using hot water causes hair to look dull and frizzy. Cold water will help your hair shaft lie flat and contribute to the shiny, smooth look you're after.

, Since you're using a vinegar rinse, there's no need to condition your hair after shampooing. The rinse will leave your hair soft and smooth.

, Slowly pour it over your scalp and try to distribute it evenly over the top of your head. Use your fingers to massage it into your scalp and smooth it into your hair from the roots to the tips.

, This will allow the rinse to fully soak into your hair. Use the time to complete your shower routine.

, Give it a quick rinse to remove the extra vinegar from your hair. There's no need to go overboard, since the smell of the vinegar will be gone once your hair dries.

, Either let it air dry or use a hair dryer to dry your hair. When you're finished, it will be silky and soft. The vinegar smell should be gone.

, You may love the results of your rinse so much you're tempted to repeat it every time you wash your hair. However, vinegar can dry out your hair if you use it too often. Use it just once or twice a week to remove buildup in your hair and restore shine."

, Egg whites, like vinegar, clarify hair and make it look beautifully shiny. Since you've already got the vinegar out, why not try adding an egg? You can also use an egg white in place of vinegar if you happen to be out when your hair needs a rinse. Here's how to use an egg white in your rinse:


Mix up your vinegar rinse as normal. Place it in a container with a lid.
Separate one egg, letting the white drop into the container with the vinegar. If you have dry hair you can apply the yolk to the ends for extra moisture.
Place the lid on the container and shake well before use.

, If your hair is quite dry, you can massage a bit of oil into the ends before rinsing your hair with the vinegar. Try:


1/2 to 1 teaspoon melted coconut oil
1/2 to 1 teaspoon almond oil
1/2 to 1 teaspoon olive oil

, If you're having trouble with this rinse because you don't like the smell of vinegar, you might want to try scenting it with herbs. The herbs impart a gentle scent that helps to mask the vinegar and make it more pleasant to use. Here's how to do it:Mix your vinegar rinse as usual, and pour it into a small saucepan.
Add a tablespoon of your favorite dried herb, like lavender, rose hips, sage, mint, or rosemary.
Bring the rinse to a simmer and let the herbs cook for 10 minutes.
Strain the herbs from the rinse and let it cool before use.

, Using essential oils is another easy way to mask the scent of the vinegar and make your rinse smell great. Some essential oils are even beneficial to hair in their own right. Mix up your rinse as usual and stir in 5 to 10 drops of one of these essential oils:


Lavender. It has a soothing effect and is often used in skin and hair products.
Tea tree oil. It can help combat dandruff and has a strong herbaceous scent.
Lemongrass. This energizing scent effectively masks the vinegar smell.

Distinguish between split ends and frizz.,
Check your hair often.,
Braid your hair.,
Look for common split ends.,
Examine your hair for different types of split ends.,
Use a magnifying glass.,
Talk with your hair stylist.,
Learn what causes split ends.,
Remove the split ends.,
Prevent split ends in the future.",How to Detect Split Ends," Split ends are usually found at the tips of your hair. In general, you should be able to brush your hair like normal and style it without much problem if you have split ends. But, if you find that you're having trouble getting your hair to cooperate, you probably just have frizzy hair.For example, if you're having trouble getting your hair to lie flat and it's humid out, you're probably dealing with frizz.;
, It's easy to fall into a hair routine where you use the same products and treatments again and again. Be in the habit of closely looking at your your hair at least once a week. This way, you'll be able to catch split ends early before they spread up the length of the strand.


If you notice a lot of split ends, you may want to change your hair products or routine. You'll still need to trim the split ends, but changing your hair treatments could prevent split ends in the future.

, Divide sections of your hair into braids that are about 1 inch wide. Keep the tension even as you braid so you don't make the braid taper unnaturally. Look at the braids of hair to see if they are the same thickness from top to tip. If they taper by the end, the hair is damaged and probably has split ends.This method for finding split ends doesn't work if your hair is weighted or layered. If your hair is over 12 inches long, it may start to taper because of normal wear (not split ends).

, Wear your hair loosely so you can pull strands in front of your face. Examine the tips of several strands. Each strand of hair should be straight at the end. But, if the hair is split, the strand will fork off into two or three different directions.


It's easy to remember that common split ends make little ""Y"" shapes at the tips of your hair strands., There are more variations of split ends than you may think. If your hair has more complex split ends, your hair may be more damaged and need more of a trim. Look for:Triple/Multiple splits: these look like regular splits, but there could be three, four, or even five splits on the same end.
Feather/Tree splits: these are split ends that appear all over a strand of hair, either all on one side or switching back and forth like tree branches.
Double Y splits: this happens when a split forms into another split.
Long or deep splits: if a regular split isn't trimmed, but keeps growing, one end of the split just keeps on growing.
Baby splits: this is the beginning of a new split which will develop into a larger split.
Tapered splits: these are just regular strands of hair that get thinner and thinner towards the end of the hair.
White spot splits: white spots develop on the hair when the strand repeatedly tapers in and out.
Thickening splits: the split has formed but the ends haven't separated yet.
Offshoot splits: there is a white spot from where a thickening split formed, but didn't actually split off.
Incomplete split: the split formed, but then joined together at the end and continued growing.

, Either take a plucked strand of hair or hold your hair in front of you. Take a magnifying glass and examine the hair for signs of splitting, fraying or feathering. Realize that just looking at a strand or two of hair won't help you find the split ends. Instead, it will give you an idea of how healthy your hair is.For example, if you check 5 strands of hair under the magnifying glass and 4 of them are split, your hair is probably pretty damaged in general. But, if you don't find any or only see one, your hair might be pretty healthy.

, If you're still unsure whether your hair is fraying at the tips, ask your hair stylist to take a look the next time you get your hair cut or styled. You could also ask a friend to take a look at your hair for signs of fraying. This may be especially helpful if you have short hair and can't pull the hair between your fingers to check.


Consider how often your hair tangles. If it frequently tangles or needs to be brushed, your hair probably has split ends that are contributing to the knots., Research has shown that overusing dandruff shampoos that contain ketoconazole 2% can cause split ends.Blowing out, curling, using a flat-iron straightener and chemically treating your hair (with bleaching, coloring, or perming) can all damage your hair over time.Even a simple hair routine like brushing your hair can damage hair if you brush your hair when it's wet.

, Since hair is made up of tissue that isn't living, you can't heal the split ends. Although you can help the split ends stay closer together by moisturizing well, the hair is still damaged. To treat split ends, you need to trim at least 1/2 an inch or 1 inch (2.5 cm) (depending on how bad the split ends are). If you have a lot of split ends, consider getting a complete trim of all of your hair cutting at least 1/4 to 1/2 inch off the ends.


Always use scissors to trim in a straight line. Never tear the hair using your fingertips.

, Be gentle on your hair. Avoid repeated hair treatments that can damage your hair. For example, don't brush your hair forcefully or you could break the strands. You should also avoid chemically treating your hair on a regular basis. This might mean that you follow your hair's natural tendencies rather than fighting them.Remember to trim your hair at least once every few months to catch split ends before they damage your hair.


For example, if you have curly hair, don't use a flat-iron straightener every day. This can damage your hair over time and cause split ends.
You can also add healthy fats (like avocado or olive oils) to your diet. These may improve your hair's health and strengthen the strands.

Brew a strong pot of coffee.,
Shampoo your hair as normal, rinsing well.,
Standing in the bathtub, pour cold coffee through your hair, starting at the roots.,
Gather your hair under a shower cap and let it sit for 20-60 minutes.If you don't have an old shower cap, wrap your hair in an old towel you don't mind ruining.,
Rinse your hair with warm water and allow your hair to air dry.",How to Do a Coffee Hair Treatment1," A regular cup of coffee uses 2 tablespoons (7-9 g, or 2 scoops of a coffee measurer) of grounds per cup, which uses about 6 oz (178 ml) of water.To make the coffee stronger, add another 1-2 tablespoons of grounds. For a pot equivalent to 8 cups of coffee, use 48 oz (1.5 L) of water and 18-20 tablespoons (80g) of grounds.


Note that the stronger the coffee, the darker the brew. Soaking your hair with coffee will darken your color, which can be great for brunettes or people with gray hair, as it can add depth and darken your hair color.If you are blonde or have light red hair, or have dyed your hair a light color, you may may want to try a different method of treating your hair. Otherwise, you may end up with dingy or dirty looking hair.If you don't have coffee, you can use a ground espresso instead.;
, Make sure you have completely rinsed out the shampoo. Use your hands to gently squeeze out any excess water from your hair--it doesn't need to dry completely, but it shouldn't be dripping wet., For a thorough treatment, use a bucket or large bowl to catch the coffee drippings as you pour it through your hair. Then pour the drippings back through your hair a second time.If you want more control over the application, transfer the cooled coffee into a spray bottle and spray it into your hair.If you are worried about the coffee staining your bathtub or shower floor, pour the coffee through your hair while leaning over a bucket, so it catches the drippings.
Rinse any coffee out of your bathtub immediately to prevent staining.

, Remember that coffee will stain fabrics and some porous surfaces, so don't let your hair drip onto carpeting or furniture, and don't wear any nice or light-colored clothing.If any coffee got on your face or ran down your neck, clean it off with soap and water so it doesn't stain your skin.The longer you leave the coffee in, the darker your hair may become.

, Repeating this treatment will make your hair darker, shinier, and will increase hair growth while minimizing shedding.If you want to make the most of the coloring properties of coffee, rinse your hair with apple cider vinegar, as this will help the color to set."

Brew a pot of coffee using about 8 tablespoons (or 30-35 g) of coffee grounds.,
Place a coffee filter or cheesecloth over your drain.,
Massage a handful of cooled coffee grounds into wet hair.,
Rinse your hair, making sure you wash out all the coffee grounds.",How to Do a Coffee Hair Treatment2," You only need about a handful of grounds, so this should give you enough to work with. Feel free to add more or less, depending on what you think you'll need.Coffee grounds will darken your hair, so if you have light-colored hair, you may want to find another method to make your hair glow., You don't want the coffee grounds to go down the drain--they can mess with your plumbing and should be disposed of in the trash rather than down the drain. A filter will catch the grounds before they get into your pipes, and when you are finished with your treatment you can toss them in the trash., Work the grounds into your hair, rubbing it into your scalp and scrunching it into your longer locks.The rough grounds will exfoliate your scalp, which stimulates your hair follicles and can kick-start hair growth.If you want to make the coffee scrub part of your regular grooming routine, dry out the grounds and then add them to your shampoo, conditioner, or hair oil., The coffee grounds should have removed any build up from your hair, leaving it soft, shiny, and healthy. Dispose of the coffee grounds you caught in the drain by throwing the filter into the garbage or compost.


With regular use, you may notice your hair is growing faster, too. The caffeine in coffee blocks a hormone that causes hair loss and allows your hair to remain in its growth cycle longer than normal. Try using coffee grounds once or twice a week.Dry your hair with an old towel, and remember if your wet hair drips on your clothes the coffee may ruin them. Wear a towel around your shoulders or an old t-shirt until your hair is dry.

Choose a gentle shampoo.,
Use natural conditioner as well.,
Consider using natural hair oils.,
Avoid the use of styling products.",How to Get Silky Hair if You Are a Guy1," To keep your hair silky, you need to keep it clean, but not too clean. The natural oils in your hair are what helps to keep it strong and healthy, but those oils can also trap dirt and become greasy, making you hair dirty. You need to strike a balance between too much cleaning and not enough to have silky hair, meaning that a gentle shampoo is an essential part of your cleaning routine.


Try to use shampoo made with natural ingredients, and avoid shampoo with strong artificial fragrances. These dry out the hair over time and affect the hair's ability to form its own natural oils. Read the ingredients and avoid shampoos with parabens and sulfates. It’s especially important to avoid sulfates if you have curly or wavy hair.
Even if you are not a child, children or baby shampoos can be quite effective in maintaining silkiness and using a minimum number of ingredients. These are usually gentle on the hair and on the eyes, as well as pretty cheap and available, making it an effective purchase, regardless of how old you are.;
, One of the best ways to get silky hair is by regularly conditioning, even if you're not washing your hair. Conditioner helps to strengthen the tips of your hair, keeping the individual strands strong and healthy, avoiding split ends and other hair problems that can affect the texture of hair. Just as you would with shampoo, look for conditioner that lacks in artificial fragrances and dyes.


If you have a short hairstyle, you will not be able to avoid getting conditioner on your scalp. Use a mild or volumizing conditioner to keep your hair from getting weighed down.
Though they're commonly marketed to guys, Try to avoid using Two-in-One shampoo and conditioner combos, as well as body wash-shampoo combos, which won't allow you to condition your hair separately, and can have a long-term drying affect, counteractive to the purpose of conditioner. Buy separate products.

, Depending on the natural oiliness of your hair, it may be good to supplement your cleaning routine by combing a small amount of oil into your hair, which can help enrich and strengthen it, as well as create the silky texture that you desire. Coarse hair is commonly treated by combing some variety of oil into it daily, or a few times a week. Good natural oils for the hair include:

Most styling products involve alcohol, which leech the moisture from your hair and ruin its ability to stay moisturized naturally. Don't get in the way of your body by using styling products, let your body work for you.

Seal in the moisture from the water and the conditioner.,
Protect the ends when you style your hair.,
Use deep-treatments for your hair.,
Avoid excessive style damage.",How to Trim Your Own Split Ends4," After shampooing your hair, don't forget to use conditioner. Hair can split and break for a number of reasons, but often it's because the hair isn't properly moisturized.


Use conditioner that's tailored to your specific hair style. For dry hair, use a conditioner with natural oils (shea butter, coconut butter, etc.), and condition the ends more than the scalp. For oily or fine hair, use a light conditioner and go very easy on conditioner near the scalp.
Moisturize at least every time you shampoo. Your hair is made out of proteins, and needs nutrients just like other organs in our body. If you shampoo every other day, be sure to hit your hair with moisturizer after each clean.

, You did all that work getting moisture into you hair — don't let it go to waste! Use products like shea butter or olive or coconut oil to help seal in the moisturizing treatment you just gave your hair.

If you can, let your hair air-dry after you step out of the shower: give it a quick pat-down with a towel, spray in some detangler, give your hair a quick run-through with a comb, and let it dry on its own.
Don't brush your hair when it's wet. Your hair is very vulnerable to breakage when it's wet, so you should be careful. Use a wide-toothed comb on wet hair to cut down on split ends and other damage.

, This will help prevent the ends of your hair from splitting. If you already have split ends, then you will need to cut 1 ½ inches above the split; this will prevent your hair from splitting further up the shaft., It may not cause the split ends to seal themselves back together, but it will help make the rest of your hair stronger, and prevent the damage from becoming worse. Here are some foods that have lots of protein: Beans
Dairy products, such as cheese, milk, and yogurt
Eggs
Fish and seafood, including halibut, salmon, and tuna
Meat, including chicken, lean beef, turkey, pork, and veal
Nuts and seeds, such as pistachios and pumpkin seeds

, This may not necessarily fix the split ends, but it will help prevent them from getting worse. There are different ways in which you can protect your hair from the elements. There's a list to get you started:


Wear hats and scarves when going outside, even in the winter. The cold air can be just as damaging as the hot sun. Consider using a UV-shielding spray for your hair if you are going to be outside on a hot, sunny day for a long time.
Protect your hair from chlorine when swimming by wearing swim caps.

, These ingredients are very damaging to your hair, and will make your split ends worse. Here is what you should try to avoid and why:Sulfates, sometimes listed as sulfites, are harsh detergents also found in commercial cleaning products. They give shampoo that nice lather, but they can also strip your hair of its natural oils and make it dry and brittle.
Silicones are plastics that help your hair become smooth. Unfortunately, they can only be removed with sulfates; a buildup of silicone can lead to limp, dull hair.
Parabens are preservatives and may lead to cancer. It is best to avoid them.

, Try to air dry your hair when possible; if you must use a hair dryer, then turn it on to the lowest setting. Also, avoid using hair straighteners and curling irons every day. Excessive heat can cause your hair to become dry and brittle, which will make split ends worse than they already air.


Always your hair with a heat protection spray before straightening or curling it. This will protect it and prevent it from becoming dry and brittle.

, Start from the ends ad work your way upward, brushing in small sections at a time. If you have curly hair, consider using a wide-toothed comb. Never brush your hair from the roots straight down; this can cause your hair to snag and tear, which will make the split ends even worse.

Determine your hair type.,
Choose shampoo and conditioner for your hair type.,
Apply shampoo to your scalp, not along the length of the hair.,
Massage your scalp.,
Shampoo only as often as you need to.,
Follow shampoo with conditioner.",How to Get Your Hair to Be Long and Healthy1," This may depend on your hair's thickness, chemical processes you've used, and/or your scalp condition.


Fine hair is characterized by a small diameter of the individual hairs. This hair tends to fall flat and may be more difficult to style. It also may be more susceptible to damage from styling and chemical processes.
Thin hair is hair that has a lower density per square inch. While these hairs may or may not be fine, thin hair has many of the styling issues that fine hair has.Thick hair, by contrast, has a higher density per square inch. No matter whether it's straight, wavy, or curly, thick hair tends to be drier than fine hair and requires daily moisturization.There is a wide range of types of curly hair, from tight kinks to loose waves. The important thing to know about curly hair when choosing products is that it tends to be drier than straight hair.
Color-treated hair has been dyed using chemical processes. Dyes strip the protective outer layer of lipids from hair, leaving it vulnerable to damage. Products designed for this kind of hair are meant to protect it and keep heat and water from leaching your color.Dry hair is usually the result of over-processing, be it coloring, heat-styling, or overuse of products containing alcohol. It is fragile, so tends to break easily.
Oily hair usually refers to oily scalp. Hair may be difficult to clean, feel greasy, or have an unpleasant smell. Dandruff also results from an oily scalp. This can be due to a number of factors, including hormones, vitamin deficiencies, and heredity. Ironically, it could also be that your scalp was dry–and the body, in compensation, is now overproducing oil.;
, Hair types include normal, fine, dry, oily, color-treated, and dandruff.


Fine and thin hair may benefit from products labeled ""volumizing,"" which boosts body.For thick and/or curly hair, avoid products with sulfates in them (ammonium laureth sulfate, ammonium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate). These are detergents that can strip curly hair of its moisture and leave it frizzy.For dry hair, look for moisturizing ingredients, especially natural oils like coconut, argan, avocado, jojoba, and grapeseed. Stay away from products containing alcohol.Color-treated hair should be washed with products specifically formulated not to strip the color. Steer clear of ""clarifying"" shampoos, as they are meant to remove product buildup and may be too harsh for your hair.For oily hair, choose a mild, oil-free shampoo, such as baby shampoo, and a conditioner formulated for oily hair.You can also use a clarifying shampoo, but do not use it every day.
Contrary to popular belief, dandruff is caused by an oily scalp. Yeast lives in the oils and creates irritating by-products that cause flaking in the scalp. Consider a shampoo and conditioner with tea tree oil, which acts as a natural anti-fungal., You want to target where the oils are produced, which is at the hair follicles, located under the scalp. Massage a small amount of shampoo into your scalp, and when you rinse, let it flow through the length of your hair., Giving yourself a little scalp massage helps increase circulation; more blood to your hair follicles means that nutrients can reach them more quickly.While you can do this any time, washing your hair is a good opportunity, since you have to massage the shampoo in anyway. After you apply the shampoo, work your fingertips gently into your scalp, starting from the back of the neck and ending at the hairline., Very oily hair may need daily washing, but dry and even normal hair can often do with a shampoo once every couple of days.Shampoos contain harsh detergents that strip the hair of its oils, so using them less frequently can help your hair look and feel better., Conditioner can increase shine, improve elasticity, reduce tangles, and even provide some UV protection. Conditioner only needs to be applied to the ends of the hair, however, so skip the scalp. It is also really good to rinse the conditioner out of your hair with cold water before getting out from shower.This will help to close hair cuticles and seal in the moisture.

Split ends occur most often at the tip but can show up anywhere in your hair. Split ends and related damage can occur in several different forms. If you find any of the following, remove them using the instructions below:


Hair tips splitting into two or more strands
A hole in the middle of your hair (more visible if you bunch up the strand)
White dots at the end of your hair
Single strand knots (more common in dry, curly hair);
, If you're not due for a full haircut, take care of the split ends yourself. Trim them off using a small pair of hair shears, since scissors can fray your hair and lead to more split ends. Cut single strands about ¼"" (6mm) above the split. If you cut too close to the damage, the split may reappear.


Some splits form a small ball directly above the damage. Make sure to cut above this.
This can take a long time, especially for thick or damaged hair. However, you'll get to keep the full length of your hair.

, A hairdresser can always trim off split ends, but will usually remove about 1⁄4 to 1 inch (0.6 to 2.5 cm) of your hair along with them. Eventually, all hair will wear out enough to require this treatment. How long you wait between haircuts depends on your hair type, hair health, and how much time you're willing to spend hunting down your own split ends. This can be anywhere from six weeks to six months.


If you aren't trimming split ends yourself, avoiding the hairdresser will not save your long hair. Neglected split ends will become weaker and weaker, eventually breaking off.

, If trimming off split ends are affecting your hair length goals, consider having your hair cut into layers. Ask the hairdresser to trim damaged hair in the surface layer, while leaving lower layers — and length intact. If you have afro-textured hair, a mild texturizer can achieve a similar effect, allowing you to manipulate your hair more easily and avoid trimming healthy hair.

, There are conditioners and other commercial treatments that claim to ""heal"" split ends. These seal the split ends shut to hide them from view, but the damage is still there. You can use these as a temporary fix, but relying on them long-term may lead to worse damage.


These products may help prevent future damage to otherwise healthy hair.

, Too much shampoo can strip away healthy oils, leaving your hair vulnerable to damage. Follow these tips to find a regimen that minimizes split ends:


Wash your hair no more than three times per week (or less often if you have thick curls or afro-textured hair.)
Wash only your scalp and the hair nearest to it. Leave the rest of your hair down. It should receive enough washing from the shampoo that runs down on its own.
Hot water strips away protective oils, so rinse your hair with the coolest water you can stand.
If your hair still splits rapidly, try a different, milder shampoo. Avoid shampoos with sulfate or paraben.

, After shampooing, apply conditioner along the length of your hair. Let it soak at least three minutes before you rinse it out.

, Vigorously rubbing your hair dry with a towel is not a good idea. Instead, gently squeeze dripping wet hair with a towel to remove excess water. Once the excess water is removed, let your hair air dry naturally.


If you need to speed up the drying, use a blow dryer on a medium or low setting, preferably set to blow cool air. Hold it a few inches (several centimeters) away from your hair to minimize damage.
If you normally wrap your hair in a towel, try a cotton T-shirt instead.

, If your conditioner regimen isn't working, try a ""deep condition"" once or twice a month. This involves putting a leave-in conditioner or oil on your hair and leaving it in for a while. Oils like jojoba and coconut oil are fantastic for this. Here's an example regimen:


Get your hair nice and wet
Drop a coin-sized amount of deep conditioner or oil on your palm. Use a dollop the size of an American dime for hair below shoulder length, up to a quarter+ for hair that reaches your waist.
Rub it through your hair.
Let it sit for five to ten minutes for very damaged hair.
Rinse out with cold water.

, Your brush or comb should aid you in untangling your hair, not pulling it out. The best option for people with thick hair is a wide-toothed, wooden comb or pick. People with thin hair may use a narrow-toothed, wooden comb or a brush with boar bristles or another flexible, natural bristle.

, Start at the bottom and work your way up. When you encounter a tangle, stop and untangle it with your fingers before you continue brushing.


Stop teasing or backcombing your hair. This pulls up the scales of your hair, making it easy to break them off.
Do not brush more than necessary. Once the brush or comb runs through your hair without obstruction, you're done.
Hair is very fragile when wet. Brush it only when dry, unless you have very thick, curly hair that can only be brushed wet.

, Sleep with your hair in a braid or bun to help prevent tangles and breakage. A sleep cap or a satin pillowcase may help as well.

, Make sure to eat the recommended amounts of vitamins and protein to ensure that your body produces the healthiest hair possible. Healthy fats such as omega-3 fatty acids can also help keep your hair whole and shiny.


Vitamin E is particularly useful. Vitamin E can be found in many foods, such as nuts, seeds, avocado, vegetable oils, some leafy greens, and some fish.

, Use a nutrient-rich oil such as almond oil, argan oil, egg oil, castor oil, or extra-virgin olive oil. This can lubricate the hair shaft, preventing it from splitting. Oil up to twice a week, leave it on overnight under a cap, and it wash off in the morning.


Avoid products that contain paraffin or kerosene, which cause drying.
Apply oil to the middle and ends of your hair. Applying oil near the scalp can cause a buildup of dandruff or damage the roots.

, Tight, elastic bands or any bands with metal parts can damage hair, especially if left in for a long time. Scrunchies and ribbons treat your hair more gently.

, A hair mask once every one or two weeks can help keep your hair healthy, moisturized, and damage-free. Leave it on for thirty minutes, everywhere except near your scalp.


Try mixing your own out of olive oil, honey, and conditioner.

, Heat denatures the keratins (proteins) of the hair shaft weakening it and making it prone to split ends. Heat treatments are a major cause of damage and split ends. This includes hot blow drying, heat styling, straightening and curling through heat, and steam treatments. If you do use these treatments, take these precautions:


Do not straighten or use other high-heat treatments more often than once every two weeks, or preferably once a month.
Look for irons or other tools that allow for exact temperature control. Keep them set to below 356ºF (180ºC).
Let hair stylists know that you prefer low-heat treatments.

, Consider applying a special pre-swimming moisturizer product. Alternatively, use a leave-in conditioner, oil your hair, and/or wear a swim cap. Rinsing your hair thoroughly before swimming may reduce its absorption of harmful chemicals. Be sure to rinse and shampoo your hair as soon as possible after swimming.

, If you have delicate hair, minerals or chlorine in your water can damage your hair. Consider a water softening system if your local water is ""hard"" and contains high levels of calcium carbonate. Use a filtration system to remove chlorine if necessary in your area.

, Ultraviolet rays can be as damaging to your hair as your skin. Wear your hair in a bun underneath a hat, or use leave-in sunscreen conditioner

, Hair dyes and bleach are particularly damaging, but any product has the chance to wear out your hair. Try to use them only when necessary, and your hair may stay healthy for much longer.

Avoid very tight hairstyles, especially if you have fine hair.",How to Get Your Hair to Be Long and Healthy2," Hair is a fiber: think of it as a delicate wool. Just like wool, it is particularly fragile when wet. To minimize damage, avoid brushing your hair when it's wet, and never use heating irons (curling or flattening) on wet locks., Using a wide-tooth comb, start from the bottom of your hair and detangle the last few inches. Next, detangle a few inches higher, working your way up to the top. This gentler method detangles gradually, which is a less damaging and will lead to less breakage than yanking a comb from the roots to the ends.


Try to let hair dry just a little before combing.

, Brushing your hair causes friction, which damages the cuticle and leaves hair frizzy and dull. Detangle with a wide-tooth comb, and only brush when you need to for styling purposes.


Use a paddle brush with ball-tipped bristles, which is gentler on the hair., Towels can cause friction and can rough up the hair cuticle, causing frizz (particularly if you rub your hair with one). A soft cotton t-shirt, on the other hand, is a much gentler way to absorb excess water.Instead of wringing out your hair, wrap it in the t-shirt.

, Let your hair air dry if possible.If you do use a hair dryer, use it on the lowest setting.
If you're using a curling or flattening iron, minimize the time it contacts your hair, limiting it to 3-4 seconds per section. Always apply a heat-protective product beforehand to help prevent heat damage., This includes relaxers, perms, dyes (particularly with ammonia or peroxide), and bleaching/lightening your hair. In particular, don't re-bleach, re-relax, or re-perm hair that has already been treated, as this can drastically weaken hair. It is fine to get a touchup every six weeks or so, but this treatment is only applied to the new growth.

, There's no need to spend money on commercial hot-oil treatments. Instead, apply coconut or olive oil to dry hair, wrap it in a t-shirt (or cover with a shower cap), and let it sit overnight. Rinse it out the next day with lukewarm water. Do this treatment once a week.

, While it's a myth that this can actually make your hair grow faster, split ends can actually inhibit the growth of long, healthy hair. Neglected split ends can travel up the hair shaft all the way to the roots. What's worse, you can develop multiple split ends, where the splits themselves develop splits.To keep this problem at bay, cut your hair every 8 to 12 weeks, and ask your stylist to take off the ends only., Anything that feels like it's pulling is probably too tight and may cause traction alopecia (hair loss). Extensions and cornrows can also cause damage. Instead, stick with looser ponytails or braids."

Beware of products that claim to make your hair grow faster.,
Have patience.",How to Get Your Hair to Be Long and Healthy3," Consuming adequate levels of protein is essential for hair health.While the amount of protein you need depends on several factors, including how physically active you are, a good rule of thumb is to eat a minimum of 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, or about 2.8 grams per pound. Sources of protein include: seafood, lean meats, eggs, beans, nuts, milk, cheese, and yogurt., Iron-deficiency anemia can be a cause of unhealthy hair (as well as other health issues), so it is important to ensure your iron levels are adequate. B vitamins and biotin encourage hair and scalp health.Likewise, low stores of Vitamin C can result in poor hair growth. If your levels are low, consider taking a multivitamin with iron.Never take more than the recommended daily dose of a vitamin, as some can be toxic in high quantities.

, Polyunsaturated fats have a range of benefits for your hair. They help skin and hair retain moisture and stay supple, and can also help reduce dandruff. Omega 6 fatty acids are found in leafy vegetables, seeds, nuts, grains, and vegetable oils (corn, safflower, soybean, cottonseed, sesame, sunflower), while walnuts, flax seeds, mung beans, and fatty fish are packed with Omega 3 fatty acids., While this may not sound like a nutrition change, smoking actually limits the delivery of nutrients to your hair by restricting blood vessels. The result is dull, brittle locks. Your hair will look (and smell) better if you quit., When you're stressed, your body may produce more cortisol (a steroid hormone), which results in increased hair shedding. Learn ways to minimize stress, such as meditation, regular exercise, and adequate sleep., The market is full of products that claim to speed up hair growth. However, there is no scientific way to make your hair grow faster, so think twice about spending a fortune on such items, whether pills, shampoos, or oils.

Wash your face.,
Moisturize.,
Wear sunscreen.,
Find the right products.,
Personalize your routine.",How to Improve Your Facial Skin1," You can improve your facial skin by taking good care of it every day. Get in the habit of making skin care part of your daily routine. You should wash your face in the morning and in the evening and after sweating heavily. Use a gentle, non-abrasive, alcohol-free cleanser and warm water. Water that is too hot or too cold is not good for your skin.








Use your fingertips to apply your cleanser. Do not use a washcloth, loofah, or mesh sponge, as these can irritate your skin. Resist the urge to scrub your face — always be gentle.
Make sure to rinse the cleanser thoroughly from your face. Otherwise you could suffer from buildup, which can clog your pores and make your skin look dull.
Pat your face dry gently but thoroughly with a soft, clean towel. Use a separate towel for your face instead of the one you (or others) use to dry your hands. You do not want to transfer germs to your face.;
, You should also put moisturizer on your face twice a day. Gently apply your product after you wash your face. Use gentle upward and circular strokes, especially around the delicate skin of the eye area Don't ever pull your skin down — gravity does enough of that.








You should use two different moisturizers. The one you choose for daytime should include SPF production. Your nighttime cream should be a bit thicker and offer more thorough hydration.

, If for some reason you cannot find a moisturizer that you like that contains SPF, make sure to apply sunscreen separately to your face. You need to do this every single day, not just when you're planning to spend a lot of time outside. The sun can damage your skin with just a little bit of exposure — even from behind the clouds.A good method is to put your moisturizer and make-up on as usual. Then apply a sunscreen that is specially formulated for your face. Look for one that is a spray mist, rather than a lotion. This will make application easy and will not mess up your make-up.

, Your skin is unique, so you need to find products that will work best for your specific skin type. Examine your skin and try to determine if your skin is normal, oily, dry, or a combination of dry and oily. If your skin is sensitive (easily irritated), you'll want to look for cleansers and and moisturizers that are specially formulated to be more gentle on skin.If your skin is on the dry side, you will notice that it flakes or cracks easily. Oily skin typically looks very shiny and you will notice your make-up does not stay in place for long. Combination skin means that you have different problem areas — usually your skin will be oily in your ""T"" zone (your forehead and down the center of your face, including your nose) and dry on the rest of your face.
If you have dry skin, use a gentle or creamy cleanser. Those with oily skin should use oil-free, non-comedogenic foaming cleansers that contain salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide to fight acne.If you're unsure which products to use, talk to your dermatologist or cosmetologist at a beauty supply store or department store.
Those with dry skin should use moisturizers that are labeled as creams or ointments. Those with oily skin should use lotions, as these are lighter and contain more water.Ask for some product samples so that you can try a few different things before making a commitment., You might also consider adding a serum as a step in your skin care regimen. Serums are problem-specific, so you can look for one to help smooth your skin, or to brighten it, for example. Apply small amounts of liquid serum before you apply your moisturizer. Ask for samples of serums, too.








You might also consider a toner, which can help balance the chemicals in your skin. Toners often come in the form of a spray, and are applied after you apply moisturizer and serum.
Finding a good, gentle exfoliant can also help improve your skin. An exfoliating scrub can help your skin appear more radiant and glowing. Some people exfoliate once a day, while others find once a week works best for them. Try some variations (and different scrubs) to find what makes your skin look best."

Know the complications if left untreated.,
Know that you must complete your treatment even if symptoms subside.",How to Kill Scabies At Home," Add one part sulfur powder to 10 parts cream to make an effective body cream. Apply the cream to the body as stated above. Sulfur is toxic to the scabies’ mite and can kill the mites when applied thoroughly.


Most creams prescribed contain sulphur and it is the most common ingredient for itching and killing scabies mite.Though it does not suit everyone; it should be used as a trial on a small surface of the skin to rule out allergic reactions.;
, Neem has been used in Ayurveda medicine as an astringent and antiseptic for centuries due to its antibacterial and healing properties.When treating scabies all medications should be applied on all parts of body, including between the fingers, toes, gluteal region, behind the knee and even soles of the feet.


The cream should be left on for 8-24 hours. It should be reapplied every time you wash your hands or face. It kills the mite but may also soothe the skin, numb the pain, relieve the itching, reduce the inflammation, and heal any secondary infection.The research is a little preliminary, but it looks good.Alternatively, take 5 fresh leaves of this plant. Crush them up using a mortar and pestle and apply the resultant squashed up mixture directly to the part affected by scabies.
Thirdly, you may also take this paste and put it in a small muslin or cotton cloth. Place the paste in the centre like a ball and tie up the ends and squeeze them in opposite directions to get a pure ""juice""-like extract. This juice can be applied directly to the lesion or it can be consumed every day morning on an empty stomach.

You can also use this mixed with your usual shampoo, shower gel solution or bathwater.



, Your doctor or physician may prescribe oral Ivermectin. It is an anti-parasitic medicine that kills the mite and swiftly gets rid of scabies. You'll likely see improvements within a couple of days.


However, the oral treatment may only be prescribed to immunocompromised or people who cannot comply with strict treatment regimen of the topical treatment.

, In most cases of scabies, patients who seek treatment are prescribed a cream or lotion of 5% permethrin, which is an anti-parasitic agent. Talk to your doctor about this option.


It should be applied on all parts of body and left on for 8-24 hours.
Reapply it every time you wash your hands or face.
All persons in the family should be treated.

, The itching can be taken care of with cold shower for immediate relief. Just stepping into a cold shower for less than 10 minutes will provide relief to your itching for approximately 2 hours as the body and skin sensations will be numbed for that time.Another option is to apply ice to the affected parts. Wrap a pack in a towel to keep the temperature from freezing your skin.

, Tea tree oil acts as a pesticide and kills the scabies’ mite, much like sulfur. Concentrated tea tree oil is available in store at your local pharmacy as well as naturopathy stores.


Add ten drops of tea tree oil to 100ml of lotion. Apply to the body as you would a normal lotion, making sure to get every nook and cranny. You can also add tea tree oil to your shampoo to treat scabies mites in hair.About 20 - 25 drops of tea tree oil can be poured into a bathtub to soak your complete body in the medicated water, too.

, For all the open wounds and sores where it itches and bleeds, a locally procured ointment or liniment of calendula can be applied to reduce the itching and improve the healing. The ointment must be applied only after cleaning the surface with a good soap and warm water. This should be done up to thrice a day.Calendula is famed for its antiseptic properties and will help secondary bacterial infections of the wounds and burrows with other opportunistic bacteria. It will also sooth the skin and reduce the itching.

, All carpets, upholstery, fabrics on the sofa and in the car must be steam vacuumed vigorously and the vacuum bag must be tied up well and disposed of immediately.


If the kind of device you are using has a container instead of a bag then the container must be washed well with soap and hot water.
Clean and swab the floor, especially corners, with a good medically proven disinfectant. Bleach is also effective as a disinfectant.
Dust your entire house before you begin vacuuming.

, All the upholstery like curtains, pillow covers, comforters, bedsheets, etc. and your clothes must be soaked in boiling hot water (around 100°C) for half an hour. Then use the washing machine along with a hot dryer for around 30 minutes at the highest temperature.


If there are other people who live with you, their clothes must be washed equally vigorously, but separately, in a different tub and at a different time in the same machine. This must be continued for at least a week after you have noticed no new lesions on yourself.
If something cannot be put through such rigorous routine, put it in an airtight container for two weeks to ensure that all mites have died and there is no chance of recurrence.
Use gloves while handling these clothes and discard those gloves after use.

, During this time, you should not enter the kitchen; have someone else handle the chores in the kitchen and the cooking duties, etc. Not only is it hazardous to you, it poses a big threat to your family.


All utensils must be sterilized with boiling water before and after they have been used by you.

, This is especially true for the bathroom. All hard surfaces -- countertops, tiles, sinks, bathtubs -- need to be disinfected. Spray down every applicable area with a disinfectant and scrub it clean. Use gloves that you can throw away afterward.


And when you use areas, if your case is still potent, they need to be disinfected again. Keep this in mind every time you shower or use the bathroom.

, Any environment you're in while you have an active case of scabies will likely become infected. Because of this, it's best to avoid going out if at all possible until treatment is complete and the scabies is gone. However, if you must go out, do so responsibly. Cover your skin and avoid touching other objects and people.


Avoid going to swimming pools and other group areas. Scabies is highly contagious and can spread in seconds of contact. Do those around you a favor and wait until your case is gone.

, There is no treatment required for your pets. If you are still wondering whether or not they will suffer with scabies owing to your infection, the answer is a resounding no. The insect is the human itch mite; scabies in humans cannot survive on animals.It should also be known that the human dust mite cannot survive without a proper host for more than 2-3 days. So even if it does get transmitted to your pet via your clothes, it will die within 2-3 days without producing any symptoms or trouble for your pet.

, Scabies is a contagious infection that manifests as intense itching. It caused by a small mite called Sarcoptes scabiei, or the itch mite. It burrows into the skin and causes itching. Here are the symptoms:


Intense persistent itching that has lasted for weeks and is worse at night
Tiny red bumps which may be connected with each other with pink or grey lines
Burrows (visible as lines) between raised bumps

, Scabies is spread via human-to human contact. It can also spread by sharing clothing, bedding and towels. Because of this, take care of who you come into contact with and who comes into contact with you.


Immediately adopt preventive measures like washing yourself with a good anti-bacterial soap and warm water with vigorous scrubbing if you're exposed to scabies. You may want to wash your clothes as well.
Avoid contact with people if you have scabies and/or if they have scabies as much as possible. Even shaking hands for a short duration of 5 seconds is often enough to pass on this highly infectious mite.

, If left untreated or treated poorly scabies can manifest as severe itching that may be worse than the previous episode. Scabies can also recur easily and care should be taken to avoid recurrence.


Scratching of scabies infected skin can lead to development of open sores which can lead to introduction of pathogens into the body leading to serious secondary infections.Scarring is one of the common complications of scabies infection, which results from excessive itching of the skin. To prevent scarring scabies treatment should be started immediately and should be followed to the T.

, Disappearance of the itching alone cannot be taken as a sign that you have been cured of scabies or have managed to become completely clean of the mite. The itching is what disturbs the people most and once they are relieved of itching they tend to take it lightly. Unfortunately, this is not how it works.


Quite the contrary, there is a strong possibility of re-infection immediately after you have managed to kill the current crop of mites residing in your body at that time due to the still unruptured eggs of the mite residing in the burrows in the skin. When they rupture and the new crop of mites is born, itching shall restart. Thus, completing the entire course of treatment is essential.

Your 'day' moisturiser should be lighter and used to prep your skin for even make up coverage - if it is too heavy skin may look shiny and feel oily. Your 'night' moisturiser should be much heavier and penetrate deeper into the skin to obtain long-term hydration. When choosing your moisturiser make sure that it is not oil-based and is very gentle on skin with no perfume or colour - some have quite harsh or soapy ingredients that may irritate sensitive skin. Often the best moisturisers are the simplest and cheapest - try aqueous cream from your chemist.








, If you have particular areas of dryness or irritation, use a small amount of oil-based ointment or cream purchased from your chemist, such as hydrocortisone cream. These products should be used sparingly as too much will clog pores and produce blemishes.








, It may sound counter-productive in covering up unsightly dry patches, but make up is bad for your skin and will make any skin problems worse. DO NOT APPLY FOUNDATION TO DRY PATCHES. This will turn orange or flaky and make the patches look much more noticeable, as well as prolonging the length of time you have to put up with them or even making them worse. Better to have bare dry patches for a few days than conspicuous orange bits for weeks.








, Liquid make up sticks more prominently to dry patches and looks much more uneven than mineral make up, but the mineral make up you use must be good quality, as cheap stuff contains harsh and drying chemicals that will make your skin worse. Invest in some good quality, light powder which will even your complexion. ALWAYS use moisturiser before applying make up.








, Ensure you drink plenty of water each day - around two litres should do it - to clear spots and hydrate skin. Bad skin quality can also be caused by a poor diet and lack of vitamins, so make sure you eat plenty of fruit, protein (especially if you are vegetarian), and get enough exercise. I'm sure you've had this preached to you thousand of times before but trust me, it works!

Flaking
Irritation
Burning sensation;
, Gently press a cool, clean washcloth on skin you have over-exfoliated. Hold on your skin for a few minutes or until your skin feels less irritated. Avoid rubbing the washcloth over your face, which can make irritation worse. Repeat doing this as necessary., Gently dab on a thin layer of aloe gel. This can soothe irritation and promote healing of areas you over-exfoliated.Keep the aloe gel in your refrigerator for added cooling and soothing benefits.

, Use a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, or NSAID, medication if your over-exfoliated skin causes you pain. NSAIDs can ease your discomfort and may minimize any inflammation on your skin. Follow your doctor’s instructions or the dosing recommendations on the packaging. The most common over-the-counter NSAIDs you could use are:Aspirin
Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin)
Naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn)

, When you wash your face each day, use a gentle and non-foaming cleanser.Use lukewarm or cool water and lightly work the cleanser over your skin. This can minimize the risk of further irritation and clear away bacteria or germs that could cause infection.


Use a gentle, non-foaming cleanser to wash your face. Avoid using anti-aging creams.
Avoid products with exfoliants, fragrances, or retinols because they can irritate or exfoliate your skin even more.Allow the skin to heal completely before beginning your new, toned-down exfoliating regimen.

, Rubbing your skin dry can easily irritate already fragile skin. After you’ve cleansed your skin, gently pat it dry with a clean towel. This can prevent further irritation., Apply a thick moisturizer to your skin after cleansing. This can calm your skin and promote healing.Avoid creams with fragrance or exfoliating ingredients such as retinoids. These can further irritate and exfoliate your skin., Put a 1% hydrocortisone cream on top of moisturizer twice a day. Focus the cream on irritated areas for up to two weeks. Hydrocortisone cream can ease irritation and inflammation. It can also get out any red on your skin and provide a barrier from bacteria or germs., Use a mild vitamin C cream instead of hydrocortisone if you prefer something more natural. At a concentration of about 5%, vitamin C cream may soothe your skin and help it heal faster.Avoid exposing any area with vitamin C cream to the sun. Vitamin C creams and lotions can make you especially sensitive to the sun. Covering yourself up can protect you from sunburn and further irritation and inflammation.

This can keep your skin moisturized, soothe any discomfort, and promote healing., If you’ve over-exfoliated, you took off not only dead skin cells, but new ones as well. This can expose delicate, new skin that is prone to sunburns. Protect your skin and promote healing by staying out of the sun if possible. Wear sunscreen or sunblock even if you’re just running errands. This can minimize the risk of sunburn, further inflammation and irritation, and hindering the healing process., Wait a few days to a week to return to your normal skincare and makeup routine.

Wash your hands.,
Apply a mild facial cleanser.,
Rinse your face with cool or warm water.,
Pat your face dry.,
Avoid over-washing.",How to Keep Small Pores Clean1," You don’t want to transfer dirt or germs from your hands to your face, so be sure to wash your hands before you wash your face., Use your clean fingertips to gently lather up your face. Spend 30 seconds gently massaging the cleanser across your entire face with small, circular motions.Pick a cleanser that’s appropriate for your skin type, such as dry or oily, normal or sensitive. If most of your face is covered with small pores, it’s most likely that you should be using a cleanser designed for normal, dry, and/or sensitive skin. You shouldn’t be using products aimed at oily skin.

, Using hot water can dry out your small pores very quickly, so stick to luke warm water to keep your skin moist.For this reason, it’s often better to wash your face separately in the sink instead of doing so while you’re showering.

, Use a clean towel to gently pat away the moisture on your face. Avoid rubbing since that can actually clog pores by pushing soap film and dead skin into them.

, Washing too often or too vigorously can increase skin problems rather than prevent them. Stick to a gentle washing once or twice a day for the best results.Your skin naturally regulates its moisture. Cleansing your face more than once or twice a day can dry it out by stripping away its natural oils.
Scrubbing your face with a washcloth can irritate your pores by damaging their linings and/or pushing dead skin cells and other lingering debris into them.

Be aware of strategies to prevent dry skin.,
Clean your face quickly and less thoroughly than you normally do.,
Be careful with baths and showers.,
Use lots of moisturizing creams or lotions.As soon as you get out of the bath, gently pat your skin dry (do not vigorously rub) as this helps to preserve as much of the natural moisture in your skin.,
Avoid picking or scratching at any areas of cracked skin on your face.Although it can be tempting to pick or scratch at it, especially if your skin gets scaly or red, this can worsen the cycle and actually cause more damage to your skin.

,
Stay well-hydrated.It is important to drink at least 8 cups of water daily, and more if you are doing exercise to compensate for fluid lost in sweat.,
Know when to see a doctor.If your skin does not show improvement after two weeks of treatment with a combination of moisturizers and the above treatments, it is best to seek the advice of a medical professional.",How to Heal Cracked Skin on the Face1," Knowing the causes can help to eliminate (or cut back on) any environmental factors that may be triggers for your cracked skin.These include:


Long showers or long baths (soaking can actually dry out your skin)
Harsh soaps (mild cleansers are better for dry cracked skin)
Swimming pools
Cold, windy weather
Irritating clothing (such as scarves) that may trigger a skin reaction;
, The less time your face is exposed to water and cleansers, the better. Use mild soap or cleansers, and refrain from scrubbing.

, You'd think lots of water would be helpful to re-moisturize your skin, but too much water can actually dry skin out. Keep baths and showers to 5-10 minutes duration.It can be helpful to add ingredients such as a natural oil (like mineral, almond, or avocado oil), or adding either 1 cup of oatmeal or baking soda to your bath if you are going to have one.Bathing can be soothing to dry skin (as long as not done in excess or for long periods of time), and adding any of these ingredients can help to keep the moisture in your skin.
Gently pat your face dry after your bath or shower. Vigorous drying with a towel can make cracked dry skin worse.
Also choose milder soaps for bathing as they are less irritating and less drying to the skin., Also apply a moisturizing agent right after bathing, as well as at other times during the day.


If your skin is sensitive and prone to allergic reactions, choose a moisturizing cream or lotion that says ""hypoallergenic"" on the label.
If your skin is prone to acne, choose a moisturizing cream or lotion that says ""anti-comedogenic"" on the label.
If your skin is extremely dry in certain location, petroleum jelly (Vaseline) can be a great option.For a less greasy option, you can also try Aquaphor. When used on the areas of particular dryness, it can lead to a fast recovery as it is extremely effective. However, the ""look"" is less conducive to going out in public as it can leave a shiny, greasy appearance, so it is best to use it at night.
Coat your face in Vaseline or Aquaphor if you live in a place that gets especially dry and cold during the wintertime. This will help to protect your face from becoming dry and cracked.

,,


Good hydration gives your skin the best chance of staying moisturized; although it is not a guaranteed ""cure,"" it can certainly help the situation.

, Also, if you have red or scaly lesions on your face that are getting worse, it is best to see a doctor or a dermatologist (a doctor specializing in skin care) sooner rather than later.


Although dry cracked skin is relatively common, specific lesions on your skin (unusual lumps, bumps, or colors), sudden onset, or rapid worsening of your skin warrant a visit to your physician. There could be something going on that could benefit greatly from a medicated cream or ointment or, in rare instances, from more complex medical treatments.
Changes in your skin can also be a sign of a new allergy or sensitivity. Talk to your doctor about this possibility if you skin is changing.

Moisturize daily.,
Exfoliate weekly.,
Steam your face once a week.,
Spot treat oily skin.",How to Keep Small Pores Clean2," Moisturizing can help keep small pores from clogging. Since they produce less oil than large pores, they’re more likely to lead to dry, flaky skin. Apply a facial moisturizer that’s designated for dry or normal skin once a day after cleansing to keep your small pores hydrated.Apply the moisturizer immediately after washing your face (within 3-5 minutes) for the best results. This will help lock in your skin’s existing moisture.

, Besides washing your face, you can help minimize the dead, dry skin that comes with small pores by using a mild, non-abrasive exfoliator once or twice a week. This gentle exfoliation will improve the tone and texture of the skin on your face.People with small pores will generally have drier skin, which means that you should not need to use a facial scrub with a chemical exfoliator like salicyclic acid.
Instead, look for a creamy, non-abrasive exfoliator designated for dry skin. Use one with hydrating oils or honey to keep your small pores moisturized while washing away dead skin cells.

, If your skin is dry, giving it a weekly steam bath can help stimulate the oil glands in your small pores and soften the skin on your face. It will also enhance your skin’s receptivity to moisturizers.The easiest way to steam your skin is to boil water and pour it into a wide pot or dish. Let it cool for two minutes and then place your face about 10-12 inches above the water with a towel draped over your head and the edges of the dish to create a makeshift tent for the steam.Relax and remain in this position for five minutes. Then, rinse your face with cool water and gently pat it dry with a clean towel.

, If you are having problems with oily skin, it most likely comes from large pores, not small ones. However, many people have different sizes of pores and levels of oil across their faces, which should be taken into consideration when treating or cleaning your skin. Protect your small pores from drying out while treating problem patches by spot treating only those areas that areas that are oily.The “T-zone” that covers the forehead, nose, and chin is frequently the most oily area on a person’s face. Use salicyclic acid or a clay mask once or twice a week to treat only that area. Doing so will help control blemishes on your oily skin without irritating the rest of your face."

Wear a moisturizing foundation.,
Wash your makeup brushes.,
Wash off your makeup at the end of the day.",How to Keep Small Pores Clean3," If you use foundation, apply one that will hydrate rather than dry out your small pores.There are a variety of foundations that are designed for drier skin. At the least expensive end of the spectrum are products like CoverGirl & Olay Tone Rehab Foundation and Revlon Colorstay Whipped Foundation. Mid-range products include NARS Tinted Moisturizers, Koh Gen Do Maifanshi Moisturizing Foundation, and La Mer The Treatment Foundation. If you’re ready to spend more than $100, you can get high-tech hydrating formulas like Cle de Peau Beauté Refining Fluid Foundation.You should also be able to use foundation that’s made to be waterproof (such as MAC Pro Longwear Nourishing Waterproof Foundation) or provide all-day protection (like Stila’s Stay All Day Foundation) since these are generally oil-based formulas.

, The tools you use to apply makeup will build up with oil, dust, and debris over time. Keep these from introducing harmful impurities to your face by washing them with a mild shampoo at least once a month., Don’t go bed with makeup on since it can clog and enlarge your small pores if you sleep with it on. To avoid irritations or infections, remove makeup by following the same routine as you use for washing your face."

Hydrate your skin.,
Prevent redness with a sunscreen lotion.,
Apply moisturizer several times a day.,
Give the long, hot showers a rest.,
Bathe only with unscented, organic soaps.,
Avoid contact with chemicals.,
Use common sense.,
Use other gels and creams with healing properties.",How to Heal Red Skin1," Redness from dry skin will significantly decrease if you keep your body hydrated. Drink at least 8, 8-oz. (0.23 l) glasses of water a day.;
, Look for sunscreen that blocks both UVA and UVB rays. Apply sunscreen daily.

, Apply when getting out of the shower and after washing hands. For people with severely dry skin, you may also have to apply moisturizer at select intervals. Look for the following ingredients when shopping for a good moisturizer:


Ceramides. Assists in water retention and redness relief.
Dimethicone and glycerin. These both draw water closer to the skin.
Hyaluronic acid. Similar to ceramides, hyaluronic acid assists in water retention.
Lanolin, mineral oil, and petroleum jelly (petrolatum). These ingredients help the skin retain moisture imparted during bathing.

, Prolonged exposure to really warm water can sap your skin of essential oils and moisture, leaving you dry, scaly, and possibly red. Limit yourself to warm showers that last for no longer than 10 minutes.Take an oatmeal bath. Oatmeal helps calm irritated skin, and is a proven remedy for redness caused by such things as poison oak and chickenpox.Use edible oatmeal or store-bought oatmeal baths — whichever is more convenient.

, Throw away all your perfumed and colored soaps that could be causing dryness and irritation. Instead, opt for superfatted soap whose main ingredients are shea and cocoa butter.

, Exposure to chemicals such as bleach, hair coloring or other chemical solvents can create red skin on contact.

, Ask yourself a couple of questions before you consult your doctor. An examination of your recent past should do the trick:


Did you start using any new products lately? If beginning a course of acne treatments for example, especially retinoids, these could be contributing to your redness.
Did you pick at or irritate the skin yourself? Did you over-exfoliate your skin? As a general rule, the less contact your skin gets with dirt, grime, and oil, the better.

, There are a lot of creams and gels out there that purport to help with redness relief, but two stick as being time-honored and tested:


Hydrocortisone cream. Usually applied one to four times a day, hydrocortisone is a proven remedy for dryness, itching, and redness of the skin.Aloe-vera gel. Aloe-vera gel is often used in topical form to help soothe redness by fighting inflammation. Aloe-vera soothes irritated skin as well.

Determine whether or not to pop your pimple.,
Try a pimple cream.,
Take a hot cloth and press it against the pimple.,
Put some aloe vera gel on the spot before bed.,
Put toothpaste on your pimple.,
Apply a mixture of sea salt and water to your pimple.,
Use tea tree oils.,
Use an astringent.,
Get treatment from a dermatologist.",How to Heal a Pimple1," Don't pop your pimple unless it has come to a firm white head. If you try to pop it too soon, it could further damage your skin.


If it appears your pimple is about to burst and you've decided to pop it, take the necessary precautions. Wrap your fingers in toilet paper. Get a cotton ball and put some rubbing alcohol on it. Now squeeze around the edges of the pimple, not on the white head itself. If the pimple does not pop easily, don't force it. If it does pop, then wipe up the puss with an alcohol covered cotton ball. The rubbing alcohol will sterilize the pimple, stopping other bacteria from getting into the open pimple and causing further inflammation. Once the white head is removed, do not keep squeezing the pimple.;
, There are many pimple creams on the market, but make sure to find one with either benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. Both ingredients kill acne causing bacteria in your skin. Both have the added benefit of stripping off layers of skin, which may have built up because of the pimple, leaving a smoother layer of skin behind.Be careful with benzoyl peroxide. It may bleach clothing, if left in contact for extended periods of time.

, Do this for approximately 1-2 minutes. Do not make the cloth too hot. You don’t want to scald yourself. This will increase the blood flow to the spot, which will speed up the healing process.

, Aloe vera is antibacterial as well as an anti-inflammatory. It will help your skin heal faster., Many dermatologists agree that it can help. Make sure to use toothpaste with no whitening agents or harsh dyes. If you do use them, you could end up dying your pimple a funny color. The baking soda in the toothpaste is a natural drying agent and will absorb much of the moisture from the pimple if used overnight.


You can just use baking soda mixed with a little water instead of toothpaste. Mix until you have a paste and then apply with a Q-Tip.There is some debate over how well toothpaste works on pimples., Half the battle is reducing the size of your pimple. To do this you need to remove as much of the oil as possible. Take a tablespoon of sea salt and add a couple drops of warm water. Mix and apply immediately to problem area. Leave overnight., These oils have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, which will help kill the bacteria causing your pimple and reduce redness. , Astringents are designed to reduce the size of your pores and many store-bought astringents have anti-bactierial agents to help fight the pimple-causing germs.


There are several natural astringents you can use. Most are made with acidic fruits like lemons or oranges. Others use witch hazel, vinegar, or green tea., The fastest way to heal a pimple overnight is to get to a dermatologist and have them inject the pimple with cortisone. This reduces the inflammation. However, this is a rather extreme measure because there's a possibility it will cause the spot to cave inwards looking like a reverse pimple.


Follow the dermatologist's orders. Most likely, a dermatologist will prescribe cremes, antibiotics, and soaps for your skin type. Follow their instructions exactly. Do not use more than what the doctor prescribes. Once the medication has cleared up your acne, don’t stop taking it abruptly. Give your skin time to get used to life without medications."

Start with topical medication.,
Talk to your doctor about taking oral antibiotics.,
If all else fails, talk to your doctor about isotretinoin (Accutane).,
Take precautions to help prevent rosacea.",How to Heal Red Skin2," Symptoms of rosacea, which usually present on the face, can include constant red splotches, intermittent blushing and small red bumps or blood vessels. If you think you may have rosacea, talk to your doctor about the following topical medications:


Topical antibiotics, including medications with metronidazole (Metrocream, Metrogel)
Topical tretinoins (Atralin, Renova)
Topical peels, including medications with benzoyl peroxide and azelaic acid (Azelex, Finacea)

, Oral antibiotics are used to treat rosacea because they reduce inflammation and redness quicker than topical antibiotics. Oral antibiotics include tetracycline, minocycline and erythromycin, although they can have serious side-effects like diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.

, Isotretinoin is a powerful oral medication used in acne and rosacea patients whose conditions don't respond to other medicines. Because of its strength and its association with depression, skin rashes, and joint pain, patients taking Accutane must be closely monitored by their doctor.

, While rosacea is usually chronic, steps to help prevent its onset can be taken. The most common things to avoid are exposure to sun and wind, emotional stress, heavy exercise, hot or cold weather and alcohol consumption."

Apply topical creams and ointments to psoriasis.While psoriasis can be chronic like rosacea, it can be controlled with the use of creams and other topical treatments.,
Talk to your doctor about phototherapy.,
Try certain oral medications.,
Try other natural remedies for psoriasis.",How to Heal Red Skin3," Topical creams and ointments can reduce the visibility of psoriasis significantly.


Use salicylic acid. Salicylic acid works by regulating the shedding of psoriatic scales, although too much salicylic acid over too large an area can lead to nasty side-effects.
Try steroidal ointments. Steroidal ointments are remarkably effective in decreasing inflammation, relieving itching, and halting the overproduction of psoriatic cells. Steroidal ointments are the gold standard of psoriasis treatment.
Use calcipotriene. Calcipotriene, related to vitamin D, is also effective in treating psoriasis, particularly if combined with corticosteroids. Use only in moderation, however.
Try retinoids. Retinoids contain a synthetic version of vitamin A, but are overall less effective and slower than some steroidal ointments.

, Phototherapy, or light therapy, in combination with topical ointments to deliver light to the skin where symptoms are present. Patients usually receive light therapy three times a week for three months. This combination method has been proven to be effective and preferable by patients in numerous studies, although it comes with an increased risk of skin cancer.

, Oral medications can be taken in tandem with topical medications to halt the overproduction and skin cells, which is emblematic of psoriasis. These oral medications include:


Methotrexate. Although this is a chemotherapy drug, methotrexate has been shown to produce dramatic turnarounds in patients with psoriasis.Because it can cause significant side-effects, blood tests need to be administered regularly by any consulting doctor.
Oral retinoids. Oral retinoids, like topical retinoids, contain a synthetic variant of vitamin E. For women, however, these medications need to be taken in combination with birth control for three years after initial treatment because of possible birth defects.

, Although scientifically verified medicines are often the most effective treatment options for people with psoriasis, natural remedies may provide certain benefits. Try the following:


Aloe-vera. Aloe-vera performed slightly better than a placebo in a medical test measuring psoriasis treatment.Fish oil. Taken orally, daily fish oil supplements may provide some relief of symptoms.
Bath solutions. Epsom salts, Dead Sea salts, oatmeal baths, and mineral oils can be mixed in a bath for a full-body treatment.
Cayenne pepper. Capsaicin, which gives the pepper its distinctive heat, is also used in many analgesics. Capsaicin applied to the skin may help reduce itching and skin lesions in people with psoriasis.

Reduce your stress.,
Use hydrocortisone and steroid creams.,
Try one of several oral medications.,
Try phototherapy.",How to Heal Red Skin4," Like acne, eczema outbreaks are routinely affected by stress.Lower your overall stress levels and find healthy outlets for your stress.

, Used mostly for mild eczema, OTC hydrocortisone creams may be helpful in relieving redness and itching for some people. For more severe cases, steroidal creams may be necessary.

, The oral medications that are currently used by doctors to treat more severe kinds of eczema include:


Oral antihistamines. Many antihistamines, such as Benadryl, can be found OTC.
Corticosteroids. Taken primarily if other treatments fail, corticosteroids must be taken under strict supervision of your doctor. Always follow instructions exactly with medicines such as these.

, Light therapy does help people suffering from more severe kinds of eczema. Doctors use ultraviolet light to slow the production of skin cells, resulting in less redness.

Make sure products don't contain peroxide and alcohol. These ingredients strip protective oils from the skin, leading to dry, uneven complexion.Body washes often contain harsh dyes or fragrances. If you want the aroma therapy experience of using your favorite scented body wash without exposing skin to potentially damaging chemicals, add one teaspoon of the scented body wash to each ounce of wash that is more gentle. You’ll get the clean, moisturized skin you need and the fragrance you want.;
, An hour after you wash your face, run a tissue over your forehead and the bridge of your nose. If the tissue is oily, you likely have an oily skin type. If the tissue reveals flakes of skin, you likely have dry skin.


If you have oily skin, you’ll want to look for products that are light lotions or foams rather than heavier creams and masks because oil on the skin may create a barrier sealing creams or masks onto skin and clogging pores. If you have dry skin, avoid soaps that have alcohol and peroxide, and apply moisturizers more liberally.

Retinols and peptides are good ingredients to look for, as they can help repair your skin overnight., When celebs get pimples, they may have to put their film shoot on hold, hide from paparazzi, and otherwise worry about ending up on the “celebs without make up” page. Many of these celebrities rely on dermatologists to give them amino acid therapy with light catalyst a few times a year to avoid these breakouts all together. However, professional therapies can cost as much as $4000. Instead, you should consider using a cleanser with benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid to treat chronic breakouts.

These products range from ten to fifty dollars., Deep clean into pores and remove dead skin quickly and gently using a soft-bristled brush in combination with a mild facial cleanser.

Reapply a moisturizer or sunscreen every three to six hours for optimal effect.If you have extra dry skin, consider steaming. You can buy steamers specifically made for facials that cost between $25 and $100, but it’s just as effective to use a boiled pot of water.

Everybody's skin is unique, so what works for another person may not work for you. Take a long, hard look at your skin and decide whether it's normal, sensitive, dry, combination, blemish-prone or oily.


If you have normal skin, you're lucky! Your skin doesn't get oily, your pores are small, your skin tone looks even and you rarely suffer from breakouts.

Sensitive skin tend to be very reactive - it may become dry, itchy or irritated depending on the weather, your lifestyle and the products you use.

Dry skin usually feels tight after cleansing and can suffer from roughness or flakiness, especially when exposed to cold weather or dry air.

Combination skin means that your skin can be dry and oily. It might be flaky and rough around the edges, but oily along the t-zone.

Blemish-prone skin is just that - prone to blackheads, pimples and excess oil. Even though you try to keep it clean, it still suffers from breakouts.

Oily skin can become greasy and shiny-looking within an hour after washing. The oil may even seep through your make up and cause it to slide off.
In addition, whether you have a light skin tone, medium skin tone or dark skin tone will also dictate what issues your skin is prone to, and should be taken into consideration when choosing skincare products.;
, Washing your face is super important as it cleans away dirt, oil, bacteria and traces of make-up that would otherwise be left sitting on your skin.


However, many people believe that the more they wash their face, the better - but this is a mistake. Overwashing is just as bad as not washing at all, it dries out the skin and can make it red and irritable.
Stick to washing your face twice a day - once in the morning to cleanse any oil that has built up overnight, and once in the evening to remove any dirt and make-up from the day.
Use a cleanser that is suited to your skin type (it should be stated clearly on the bottle). When possible, try to avoid using cleansers that are scented, colored, or full of chemicals, as these can be irritating on your skin, or just ineffective. When it comes to choosing products for your face - the simpler the better.
To cleanse your face, splash your face with warm water. Hot water can be too harsh and drying on your skin, but warm water is perfect as it opens the pores. Squirt some of the cleanser into your hands and use your fingers to work it into your face using gentle, circular motions.
Then rinse your face with cold water (to close the pores) , making sure that you get all of the product off. Use a clean towel to gently pat your face dry (rubbing is too rough on your skin). Or - even better - allow your face to dry naturally.

, Toner is the most overlooked product in skincare, and the step that many women skip. And while it's not absolutely necessary in your skincare routine, toning has many benefits.


Firstly, toner helps to remove any remaining dirt, make-up or dead skin cells that your cleanser leaves behind, leaving your skin squeaky clean. Secondly, toner helps to restore the skin's PH balance to its ideal, slightly acidic level. Thirdly, toner leaves skin slightly damp, which enables it to better absorb any products (like moisturizers, serums and sunscreens) that you apply afterwards.
Toners are also a great way of adding certain active ingredients to your skincare routine. What these active ingredients are will depend entirely on your skin type. People with blemish-prone skin will benefit from toners containing beta and alpha hydroxy acids which exfoliate the skin, people with dry skin should opt for moisturizing toners containing vitamin E or aloe vera, and people looking for anti-aging benefits should look for toners containing anti-oxidents (to repair the skin) and retinoids (to combat wrinkles). However, it's important to note that people with dry or sensitive skin should avoid using alcohol-based toners as these can be too harsh and drying.Most toners come in liquid form and are very easy to use. Simply squirt a little of the toner onto a clean cotton pad and gently swipe over the face and neck. Leave the toner on the skin, there's no need to wipe off.

, No matter what your skin type, moisturizing is one of the most important steps in any skincare routine. Moisturizers hydrate the skin by holding water in the outermost layer of the skin. They also protect the skin and improve skin tone and texture. However, like with other skincare products, the moisturizer you choose will vary greatly depending on your skin type.


People with normal skin should opt for a water-based moisturizer which will not upset the skin's balance. The moisturizer should feel lightweight and non-greasy on your skin. Moisturizers for normal skin usually contain lightweight oils such as cetyl alcohol and cyclomethicone.
People with dry skin need a heavier moisturizer for deep hydration. As a result, moisturizers for dry skin are usually oil-based, which is better for locking moisture into the skin. Look for particularly hydrating ingredients such as grape seed oil and dimethicone (a type of silicone oil).

Oily and blemish-prone skin still needs to be moisturized, especially if you tend to use drying cleansers and toners. Look for very lightweight, water-based formulas, and choose products that are labeled ""non-comedogenic"" which means that they won't clog pores.

Sensitive skin requires a very simple moisturizer that won't irritate the skin. Avoid colored or scented moisturizers and steer clear from any products which contain acids. Instead, look for soothing ingredients like aloe vera, chamomile and cucumber.

Aging skin tends to dry out easily, so look for a richer, oil or petroleum based moisturizer. You should also look for added benefits of ingredients like antioxidants, retinoids and alpha hydroxy acids to plump out the skin and minimize wrinkles., Regular exfoliation sloughs off dead skin cells and leaves skin fresh, smooth and glowing. That's why it's important to exfoliate at least once a week, or more (depending on your skin type).


However - many people make the mistake of believing that exfoliation means scrubbing skin to within an inch of its life. This is untrue and can actual be harmful to your skin, as intense scrubbing or rough exfoliators can cause micro-tears in the skin.Skin (especially the skin on your face) is sensitive and requires a little more love and care than people tend to give it. Therefore, if you decide to purchase an exfoliating product, choose one with small beads, not large granules.
Alternatively, you can buy cleansers with exfoliating ingredients like alpha hydroxy acids which remove dead skin cells without the need to scrub. Or you can simply use a clean, damp washcloth to gently rub your face - this works as well as any product and is pretty cost effective!
Another option is to invest in a cleansing and exfoliating tool such as the Clarisonic, which has a rotating brush for thoroughly cleansing the face and cleaning out pores. Many people who use Clarisonic brushes swear by them, but with their hefty price tag (from $100 to $225) they are not an option for everybody.
A final exfoliation option includes making your own face scrub at home. This is so easy to do and can produce results as good as any store-bought scrubs, while ensuring that you expose your face to only natural products. Try mixing brown sugar and olive oil, baking soda and water, or any other homemade face scrub ingredients!

, It may sound like the simplest thing in the world, but you should never underestimate the importance of completely removing your make-up every single night. It's a pain, and there will definitely be nights when it's the last thing you'll feel like doing, but your skin will thank you for it!


If make up is left on the skin overnight it can clog the pores, while also denying skin the opportunity to repair itself from the stresses of the day. This opens the door to blackheads, breakouts, excess oil and all manner of undesirable issues!
In addition, make up can trap free radicals that your skin is exposed to during the day. If your skin is not cleansed properly at night, these free radicals remain on the skin. This is not good, as free radicals break down collagen in the skin, leading to fine lines and wrinkles.Although the full cleanse, tone, moisturize routine is preferable, in case of emergencies you should keep a pack of cleansing wipes beside your bed, along with some eye make up remover pads. Then you just need to give your face a quick wipe to remove the bulk of the make-up before your head hits the pillow.
On the subject of make up...if possible, you should try to give your skin a break and go bare-faced every once in a while, especially if you tend to wear heavy foundation. This may seem scary, but your skin will feel much better for it. If going completely naked sounds too extreme, consider switching to a tinted moisturizer - it's much lighter than foundation but will still provide some coverage.
And finally, you should make sure to go through your make-up bag at least every six months and throw away any products that have been hanging around for a while. Make up is a haven for bacteria, so using lumpy foundation and gunky mascara can lead to clogged pores and breakouts.

, Last but certainly not least, if there's one change you should make to your skincare routine after reading this article it's to wear an SPF everyday. The importance of wearing sunscreen cannot be understated.


Sunscreen protects your skin from harmful UVA and UVB rays which contribute to a whole plethora of skin issues. For one, sunscreen has been proven to significantly reduce the risk of developing skin cancer - which is reason enough to wear protection in itself.
Secondly, sunscreen protects against the effects of aging. In fact, sunlight is one of the major culprits behind skin issues such as fine lines, wrinkles, brown spots, red veins and discoloration. By consistently wearing sun cream, you can slow down these signs of aging and preserve your skin's youthful appearance.
You should look for sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, especially if you're fair-skinned and have red or blonde hair. Many daily moisturizers and foundations come with an SPF already included, which helps to simplify your morning routine.
Remember to wear sunscreen everyday, not just over the summer or when it's sunny. UV rays are just as strong when the weather is cold and can even penetrate cloud and rain. You can provide further sun protection by wearing sunglasses and a fashionable hat, when necessary.
Never use old or expired sunscreen. It's protective benefits have essentially worn away, so it will not prevent burns or skin damage. In addition, the formulation of sunscreen often changes once it expires and can cause skin irritation and itching., Acne is one of the of the most stubborn and irritating skin problems out there. Although it primarily affects teenagers, it can last well into adulthood and no one is immune to the odd pimple here and there. Since acne is such a widespread problem, there are many treatments available and with a little trial and error you can find one that works for you.


Follow the normal skincare routine of cleansing, toning and moisturizing, but be sure to use products designed especially for acne-prone skin. Try using cleansers containing ingredients such as triclosan, benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid. Use a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer to combat any dryness.
In addition to the normal skincare routine, it often helps to use a medicated spot treatment, which usually come in cream or ointment form. Some of the most effective treatments include ingredients such as benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, sulfur, retinoids and azelaic acid. Although most of these topical treatment creams are available over-the-counter, some stronger concentrations may require a prescription.
If spot treatments alone don't seem to be working, make an appointment with a dermatologist. They can prescribe an array of medications - topical and oral - depending on the type and severity of your acne. Some people respond to oral anti-biotics, some women find that going on the pill helps, and others require more intense retinoid treatments, such as accutane.

, Fine lines, wrinkles, sagging and brown spots are all skin care issues that everybody will have to deal with at some point in their lives. However, with the right care and protection it's possible to stave off these issues and keep your skin looking young for as long as possible.


Firstly, it's important that you follow a skin care regimen using products designed for older skin. These products are richer and therefore more hydrating, which is important as older skin tends to become dried out and papery.
To combat wrinkles and saggy skin, look for moisturizing creams or lotions containing antioxidants. Antioxidants neutralize free radicals - which destroy skin cells and contribute to signs of aging. Some common ingredients that contain antioxidants include tea extracts, retinol ( a vitamin A compound) and kinetin (a plant compound that is believed to increase collagen in the skin).To deal with brown spots and sun damage, look for products that contain beta and alpha hydroxy acids as these exfoliate the skin, removing the dead, discolored layers and revealing the fresher, smoother skin underneath.
However, if you're looking for one magic, cure-all product for lines and wrinkles, there's only one product that stands up to the task - Retin-A. Retin-A - known generically as tretinoin or retinoic acid - is an acidic form of vitamin A which is extremely effective at reducing wrinkles, firming saggy skin and lightening discolorations, which it does by increasing cell turnover, stimulating collagen production and exfoliating the skin. Retin-A is only available with a prescription, so speak to your dermatologist if you're interested in starting this treatment, or read more information here., Discoloration includes problems such as brown spots, dark patches and hyperpigmentation.


These problems are caused by the overproduction of melanin in your skin, which can be triggered by a vast array of things such as sun exposure, pregnancy, menopause, birth control pills, other medications and picking at blemishes. Although discoloration will sometimes fade on its own, there are many treatments and creams that can help speed the process along.
The first step in the treatment of discoloration is to pick up a selection of skincare products containing retinoids and use them on a daily basic. Vitamin A derived retinoids exfoliate the skin to remove the discolored top layers of skin and replace them with fresh, new skin. Skin should improve over a matter of months. If you want a more fast-acting treatment, get a prescription for a cream or gel containing retinoic acid, which produces the same results but it significantly stronger.
If you're looking for more of a bleaching treatment (to lighten dark patches or melasma), hydroquinone is an effective option. Hydroquinone lightens the skin by inhibiting melanin production. The 2% formula is available over-the-counter, but you will need a doctor to prescribe the stronger 4% formula. Before using this treatment it is important to be aware that hydroquinone has been banned in large parts of Asia and Europe due to its potential carcinogenic properties.If cost is not an issue, you could also look into getting laser or light treatments, chemical peels or microdermabrasion. Speak to your dermatologist to figure out which is the best option for you.
And finally, the most important thing to remember when dealing with discoloration is to always wear sunscreen. Sunscreen can prevent UV light from triggering melanin production and making the discoloration worse.

, Having sensitive skin can be a pain - you need to be so careful about the products you use and how you treat your skin, otherwise you could end up with issues such as excessive dryness or redness, stinging sensations, red bumps or even pustules.


Having sensitive skin also makes you more prone to developing skin conditions such as eczema, rosacea, acne and contact dermatitis. However, if you can learn to have a little patience and make informed decisions about your skincare, sensitive skin is entirely manageable.
As mentioned before, when buying products for sensitive skin it is important to avoid cleanser, moisturizers and other products which contain colors or fragrances, as these products are much more likely to produce an undesirable reaction. When choosing, try to go for the simplest products possible - look for cleansers and creams with ten ingredients or less.
You will also need to avoid products containing ingredients such as antibacterial agents, alcohol, retinoids or alpha hydroxy acids. Even though these substances may be beneficial for other skin types, on sensitive skin they will merely cause dryness and irritation.
Instead, look for products that containing soothing and anti-inflammatory ingredients such as chamomile, white tea, aloe, calendula, oats and marine plants.
If there is a particular product you want to use, but you're unsure of how your skin will react, then it's a good idea to do a patch test first. Start by taking a small amount of product and rubbing it on the skin behind the ear. Do this for five nights in a row, and if no irritation occurs, try applying it to a small patch of skin beside your eye. Repeat the process and if there are no signs of irritation, it should be safe to apply the product to your entire face.
In terms of make up, look for silicone-based foundation as this is the least likely to cause a reaction. Stick with pencil eyeliners and brow fillers, as their liquid counterparts tend to contain latex, which is a common allergen. Don't use waterproof mascara, as it requires a special type of cleanser to remove which is too harsh for sensitive skin., Make sure you follow a healthy diet, enriched with the vitamins and minerals your skin needs.Vitamins B, C, E, A and K all help keep your skin fresh and glowing.


Vitamin B forms the basis of skin, hair and nails. You can find this vitamin in foods like oatmeal, eggs, rice, bananas and even Vegemite.
Vitamin C protects your skin against sun exposure, keeping you away from skin cancer. Vitamin C pops up in citrus foods such as lemons, limes, oranges, bell peppers, cranberry/grape juice, cauliflower, and leafy greens.
Vitamin E also helps protect your skin against sun exposure, and can be found in foods such as olives, spinach, nuts, seeds and vegetable oils.
Vitamin A is essential for repair of the skin tissue-without it your skin will look dry and flaky. Vitamin A is found in fruits and veggies-so load up.
Vitamin K helps reduce dark circles under eyes, as well as bruises. Vitamin K is hidden away in leafy green vegetables, dairy products, and meats such as pork and liver.

, As you probably know, drinking water is important for clear, healthy skin. This is due to the fact that your skin - like most other cells in the body - is composed primarily of water.


Without enough water, your skin can become dehydrated and look dry, tight and flaky. Over time, this can lead to the appearance of wrinkles.
Drinking water also helps to eliminate harmful toxins from the body, which would otherwise build-up and wreak havoc on your skin and overall well-being.Although there's no exact scientific measurement of how much water you should be drinking a day (it varies from person to person and according to climate and physical activity) a good base would be 6 to 8 glasses.
If drinking water isn't your thing, you can substitute by drinking plenty of green or herbal tea, or coconut water (which is said to be extra good for your skin). Alternatively you can add a slice of lemon to your drink to give it some flavour. Lemons are also extremely beneficial to the skin so you'll be killing two birds with one stone!
You should also try to eat lots of fruits and vegetables with a high water content, such as tomatoes, cucumbers, watermelon, grapes, iceberg lettuce, celery and radishes.

, Sleep is essential for healthy, fresh-looking skin - they don't call it beauty sleep for nothing! As you sleep, your skin repairs and renews itself, replacing old cells with new ones.


When you don't get enough good-quality sleep, your skin can look dull, pale and sagging the next day. This is partly due to the fact that your blood doesn't circulate as well when your tired. Lack of sleep also causes blood vessels under your skin to dilate, which leads to dark circles beneath the eyes.
So for fresh, healthy looking skin you should aim to get 7 to 8 hours sleep a night. You should also try to wake up and go to bed at the same time every day, as your body likes routine. Avoid smoking or drinking alcohol before bed, as this affects the quality of your sleep.
Aside from the sleep itself, you can make some adjustments to your sleeping conditions which will benefit your skin. For example, it's better to sleep on your back than on your front, as your face is not pressed up against the pillow (which can contribute to wrinkles).
You should also change your pillowcase at least once a week to avoid the build-up of oils, dirt and bacteria, and opt for white sheets instead of colored ones, as the dyes can irritate sensitive skin., Exercise not only keeps you in shape, but it helps your skin maintain a fresh and healthy glow by regulating the flow of oxygen to the skin.


Be sure to avoid wearing make-up when you exercise. Sweat and dirt will get trapped in your pores and cause you to break-out.
Avoid leaving sweat on your face after you work-out. Take a shower or at least thoroughly cleanse your face as soon after exercise as possible.

, Stress is bad for your skin on every level - it can contribute to excess oil, breakouts, redness, sensitivity and wrinkles. It can also aggravate skin conditions such as rosacea and eczema.


In terms of your body's chemistry, stress causes an increase in the hormone cortisol, which triggers oil production and leads to acne fare-ups. It also causes blood vessels to dilate which causes redness.
On a physical level, constantly furrowing your brow and frowning causes a loss of collagen and can lead to premature wrinkles.Therefore, by reducing your stress levels you can improve the quality of your skin. You can do this by making time for yourself and doing things you enjoy - like going for a walk, taking a yoga class or just spending time with your loved ones.

, Smoking is bad for your skin. Period. If you want to improve the appearance of your skin and prevent early signs of aging, then cigarettes should be the first thing to go.


Smoking is bad for your skin in many ways. Firstly, cigarettes contain carbon monoxide, which limits the amount of oxygen that gets to the skin, and nicotine, which reduces blood flow. These two factors can leave skin looking dull, grey and dry.
Secondly, smoking disrupts the body's absorption of nutrients such as vitamin C, which is necessary for the skin to repair and renew itself.
Smoker's tend to have more fine lines and wrinkles than their non-smoking counterparts, as smoking causes accelerated aging due to reduced blood flow to the skin.Giving up smoking is not the easiest thing in the world, but with some determination and support from your friends and family it is possible.

Try using some natural lip balms.,
Use oils to moisturize your lips.,
Apply honey to your lips.,
Use aloe vera to soothe your cracked lips.,
Try cucumber as a moisturizer.,
Give your lips a bouquet of roses.",How to Heal Cracked Lips1," Lip balm is your lips’ shield against hot, cold, and dry weather. Often, your lips will crack if you expose them to too much sun or too much cold air. Apply lip balm as soon as you feel your lips becoming dry in order to ward off cracks. When you apply your lip balm, start from the corners of your mouth and work your way into the center so that you don’t forget to moisturize the corners--they’re where the most cracks happen. Use lip balm four to six times a day.Look for lip balms that contain shea butter, cocoa butter or balms containing oils like almond or jojoba. All of these ingredients amp up the moisturizing effect of the balm. You should also look for balms that are paraben-free (a common preservative), and contains beeswax (cera alba), dimethicone, and 5% humectants (which increases your lips’ moisture).
If you are planning on having fun in the sun all day, use a lip balm that contains SPF 15, beeswax, petroleum jelly, phenol (a disinfectant), or soft paraffin (a healing oil).
Apply lip balm before you go to bed, particularly if you have a cold or generally sleep with your mouth open.;
, Applying natural oils to your lips is a great way to moisturize and heal cracks. There are a bunch of oils to choose from (see the substep). When applying the oil of your choice, put a drop or two of the oil on to your finger and smooth the oil along your lips. You can apply these oils four to five times a day, though the best time to apply is right before you go to bed, as these oils can be greasy and you may have a hard time keeping yourself from rubbing them off during the day. These oils include:


Olive oil, coconut oil, almond oil, plain butter, jojoba oil, castor oil, and milk creams.

, Honey is a bit of a wonder--it is a natural moisturizer that also fights bad bacteria. Put a drop or two of honey on one of your fingers and smooth it along your lips. Fight the urge to lick your lips (it will be hard but worth it). To keep yourself from licking, apply honey before you go to bed and then rinse it off in the morning.


You can also combine honey with glycerin (a by-product of soap manufacturing that acts as a lip softener).

, Aloe vera, like honey, does multiple things at once--it moisturizes your lips while also healing the cracks and fighting bacteria. Put a drop or two on your lips and rub it in with your finger. Leave the aloe vera on your lips for 10 to 15 minutes and remember not to lick--while it may smell great, aloe has a pretty unpleasant taste. Once the time is up, wash it off with warm water. You can do this three or four times a day depending on how cracked your lips are.Some people’s skin can become irritated by aloe vera. If you apply aloe to your lips and feel a stinging or burning sensation, wash it off right away.

, Cucumbers aren’t just great in salads--they can also help moisturize your lips. Cucumbers are packed with vitamin C, electrolytes, and fluids that can keep your lips moist. Cut a cucumber up into thin slices and then rub the slices slowly along your lips. Make sure that the cucumber juice gets every part of your lips, including the corners. Leave the juice on your lips for 10 to 15 minutes and then wash it off with warm water.

, Rose petals can be really effective in combatting chapped or cracked lips. Put a few drops of glycerin on a couple of rose petals and lay them on your lips before you go to bed. Rose petals help your lips to retain their moisture while also boosting their color."

Wash your face twice a day.,
Exfoliate.,
Choose a facial moisturizer for your skin type.,
Rub lotion on your body.,
Apply body oil after your shower.",How to Have Shiny Skin1," Your skin could be dull because it's covered in dead skin, and it may have accumulated dirt and oil over the course of the day or night.Washing will clear your pores and remove excess oil and dirt. Do not wash your face more than twice a day, however. You may irritate and dry out your skin, which will lead to a dull appearance.;
, Exfoliation removes dead skin cells and smooths out your skin for a brighter appearance. You should exfoliate both your face and body one to three times a week. More often will irritate your skin; less often will cause the build-up of dead skin cells.


Use a facial scrub for your face. You can buy a scrub from the drug store or make your own. A good natural scrub is sugar and honey. A number of body scrubs are available for exfoliating below your neck.
You may also use a scrub brush for your face. Put a few drops of your cleanser on the bristles and slowly work the brush in a circular motion around your damp face. Rinse afterwards.
Use exfoliating gloves on your body. These gloves can be worn in the shower. Lather them up with your favorite body wash and work the soap over your body. Exfoliate before you shave for an extra close and smooth body. Do not use the gloves on your face.

, Moisturizer will make your skin glow with a healthy shine. That said, you want moisturizer that will work for your particular skin type. Different moisturizers are produced for various skin types and conditions.


If you have extremely dry skin, a lotion containing an oil base (either mineral or vegetable oil) will rehydrate your skin.
If you have normal skin, find a water-based moisturizer that is not greasy.
If you have oily skin that is prone to acne, try a gel or water based moisturizer that will keep your face hydrated without clogging your pores.
If you have acne or oily skin, you may be tempted to forgo the moisturizer. If you wash your face regularly, however, you are stripping your face of its natural oils, and your body will produce extra oils to make up for the loss. This will increase the oil production on your skin and in turn produce more acne. By using a non-comedogenic, gel-based moisturizer, you can keep your skin moisturized and reduce your body’s oil production., Many people moisturize their faces but forget about the rest of their bodies! And just like with your face, you want to make sure that you choose a moisturizer that is right for your body. This will be a different type of lotion than your face. You can choose from scented or unscented varieties. Moisturize at least once a day to keep your skin glowing.


Body lotion is a basic moisturizer. It is usually made from a mixture of oil, water, and emulsifying wax.It can be used once a day after every shower. Lotion is sufficient for normal to oily skin.
Body creams and butters are made of similar ingredients to lotions, but they are often more concentrated. Body creams are recommended for dry or ashy skin., Body oils are the main ingredients of lotion but without the water and wax; they typically contain fewer chemicals than lotions. These also have much better hydrating properties, but too much can appear greasy and clog your skin. While your skin is still damp, apply a few dabs of a cold-pressed oil to your body.Don't use it on your face because it may clog your pores, causing you to break out. There are a number of good natural oils, including:


Baby oil
Jojoba oil
Sweet almond oil
Avocado oil Coconut oil "

Avoid touching your face.,
Be careful with makeup.",How to Have Spotless Skin," Wash your face, wait an hour, then dab your forehead and nose with a tissue. See if doing so feels particularly dry, oily, or sensitive to the touch. Skin types are usually categorized as normal, dry, oily, and sensitive. Every person's skin is different, and those differences can affect the best ways to keep your skin clear and spotless.Skin types change over time. If your treatments and products stop working, or cause irritation, it may be because your skin has changed.;
, Acne is when your pores become clogged with dirt and grease (black heads and white heads), and the swell, creating noticeable pimples. Grocery and drugstores will have medicines or overnight creams that will clear acne from your face. Follow the instructions for each medicine carefully, and avoid using more than one at a time.


Blackheads and whiteheads refers to the color of each spot. With a black head, your pore is still open, while a white head is closed over with a thin layer of skin (which creates the color). For skin care, they are effectively the same, and do not need different treatments.Acne is most common on your face, but can also appear on other parts of your body, including your neck, chest, back, shoulders, and upper arms.Some products for clearing acne may cause skin irritation. If this occurs, stop using them and switch to a less aggressive treatment.
If drugstore medications aren't working, you should talk to your doctor about stronger treatments.

, Using lukewarm water, carefully rub a soft cloth or sponge on your face with your fingertips. Not only is it good for your skin, it can also leave you feeling refreshed.


Don't scrub your skin. That will only cause irritation, and can make acne more likely.
You should wash twice a day, both when you wake up and before you go to bed. You should also wash your face after you've been sweating, such as after exercising or while wearing a hat or helmet.If you are using additional products, such as toner, moisturizer, or acne treatments, check the instructions on each to see when in the process it is best to wash your face. You don't want to accidentally wash any of them off.

, Toner is a clarifying lotion that helps clear the face after washing by removing excess oil and reducing the size of your pores. Put some on a cotton swab or tissue, and spread around your face. Choosing the right toner will depend on your skin type and color.

, As their name suggests, moisturizers prevent and treat dry skin. You will want to dab on just a little, and spread it around your face. There are many different kinds of moisturizer available, and your particular skin type will dictate which type is best for you., There are a variety of different ways to exfoliate effectively, depending on your skin type. Exfoliation removes dead skin cells, which can build up as your skin renews itself. These dead skin cells can clog pores and cause spots.


Just like washing, be sure to scrub gently and to apply moisturizer afterwards, otherwise your skin will dry out.

, You should eat lots of fruit and vegetables, the fresher the better. Fresh fruits and vegetables have key vitamins and minerals that will keep your skin healthy. Nuts, whole grains, and fatty fish also contain nutrients for good skin.Avoid refined carbohydrates, like white bread or cakes, whole fat dairy products, and sweets.

, There is no right amount of water, as each person's needs are different depending on their size, location, and activity level. One good rule of thumb is to drink between half an ounce and one ounce of water for each pound you weigh. If you live in a hot climate and exercise a lot, you will want more. On the other hand, if you live in a colder climate, and don't exercise as much, you don't need as much.You can also supplement this with fruits and vegetables that contain lots of water, such as cucumbers, watermelons, lettuce, and celery., Your hands are dirty, and touching your face will transfer all that dirt and bacteria to your face. That just adds up to more oils, and more spots. Remember that a spot is just a colony of germs.


Keep your fingernails trimmed. Fingernails are cesspools of bacteria, and you will want to reduce the chance of accidentally scratching your face and causing further infection. Shorter fingernails will have less space for trapping bacteria.

, You don't have to stop wearing makeup, but if you do wear it, make sure to apply it lightly. Thick makeup will clog your pores and create more spots. When you no longer need it, wash it off immediately and thoroughly.


Try finding makeup that is water-based, as it is easier to remove and tends to clog pores less often than oil-based makeup.

Start wearing scarves.,
Stay hydrated.,
Remove dead cells from your lips.,
Hold a warm cloth to your lips.,
Apply petroleum jelly to the cracks in your lips.,
Take nutritional supplements.,
Start getting more vitamin E. Vitamin E is the guardian of the skin--it is an antioxidant that protects the skin from damage, including the skin on your lips.,
Use a humidifier.,
Seek medical advice if all else fails.",How to Heal Cracked Lips2," Scarves can help to protect your lips from both bright sunshine and intense cold. If you are heading out in either one of these conditions and you have very cracked lips, you should wear a scarf that comes up over your mouth. While it may not be the most flattering look, you will be happy when your cracked lips heal.

, Making sure that you get enough water and other liquids each day will help to heal your cracked lips. One of the reasons that your lips are cracking is because you are dehydrated. Try to drink 8 to 10 glasses of water each day--at least two glasses in the morning and one before bed. Hydrating will keep your lips moist and crack free.


If you get bored with water, don’t worry--you can drink liquids aside from water and get hydrated that way. Try fruit juices and sports drink if you want some variety but keep drinking water as well.

, Before you apply lip balms or oils, you should remove dead cells and flaky skin from your lips. While this may sound gross, starting with a fresh layer of skin helps to speed up the healing process. There are two main ways to remove dead cells:


Using a sugar mix: Mix two teaspoons of sugar with a teaspoon of honey. Once mixed, apply the sugar-honey combination to you lips and gently rub it in so that the sugar granules loosen the dead skin cells. Wash the sugar mix and dead cells away with warm water.
Using a toothbrush: Wet a new, clean toothbrush and rub it on your lips. Use small, circular motions and do not press too hard--you don’t want to make your lips bleed. After doing this for several minutes, wash your lips and the toothbrush with warm water.

, Dip a clean washcloth into a bowl of warm water. Squeeze out any excess water and then hold the cloth to your lips until the washcloth gets cold. Repeat this warm water process three or four times. After four applications, dip your washcloth into cold water and hold it to your lips. The warm to cold water will help increase blood flow to your lips and make them soft and smooth.


You can also use the washcloth to exfoliate any dead skin cells on your lips. Gently rub the cloth across your lips and then rinse your lips with warm water.

, Petroleum jelly helps soothe cracks that already exist, and fight any cracks that are thinking about rearing their dry heads. You can get petroleum jelly tubes that are specifically meant to be applied to your lips, or you can use a finger to apply the jelly. Keep the petroleum jelly on your lips for at least 20 minutes before washing it off.Petroleum jelly can look greasy so if you don’t want to be seen with super shiny lips, apply the jelly at night before you go to bed.

, If you’ve tried all of the above methods and nothing seems to be working, it might be because you have a nutritional deficiency. Not getting enough iron or vitamin B can both lead to cracked lips.


To boost your iron intake, take iron supplements or eat iron-rich foods like dried fruits, broccoli, whole grains, and red meat. Treat yourself to a steak in the name of lip health.
To boost your vitamin B levels, take vitamin B supplements and eat foods that have a lot of vitamin B like chicken, salmon, bell peppers, spinach, sunflower seeds, and whole-grain bread., Try taking vitamin E supplements each day and see if that improves your cracked lips.


Look for lip balms that contain vitamin E. You can also get vitamin E oil to apply directly to your lips but it is very greasy so you will only want to apply it before bed.

, Your cracked lips might have nothing to do with your health and everything to do with your environment. Try turning on a humidifier when you are home. Humidifiers help to keep the air moist, which helps to keep your skin moisturized. Its best to turn your humidifier on at night to add moisture to the air you are breathing in during your sleep.

, If you’ve tried everything listed above and nothing seems to be working, give your doctor a call. You may have cheilitis, a common condition that causes cracks to form on the corners of your lips. Cheilitis is generally brought on by constantly licking, biting, or rubbing your lips. Your doctor will be able to tell you whether or not you have cheilitis.


If you do have cheilitis, don’t worry--your doctor will prescribe Mycolog-II or Hydrocortisone Valerate to get rid of your cheilitis symptoms.

Just like you would not knowingly eat something that could harm you, you also do not want to put something on your face that could have dangerous side effects.


Some ingredients to avoid are: BHA (can increase sensitivity to sun) and triclosan (which can affect hormone regulation). Consider finding products that tout natural ingredients., Your skin takes a beating every day.

Try dry brushing.,
Use exfoliating gloves in the shower.,
Avoid sand, salt or coffee based exfoliants.","How to Have Shiny, Glowing Legs (Girls)1"," The secret to a close shave and shiny, glowing legs is exfoliating before you shave. Exfoliation will remove dead skin cells that could otherwise clog up your razor. A razor clogged with dead skin cells will prevent you from getting a close shave., Use a firm, natural-bristle brush. Begin by brushing the outside of your knee. Brush upwards, applying enough pressure to stimulate circulation. Continue by brushing the inside of the thigh. Then brush the calf, beginning at the foot and brushing toward the groin. Finish by brushing your buttocks from the middle out toward your hip.While you want to apply pressure, you should not press so hard that it hurts.

, Exfoliating gloves are a great, chemical-free way to exfoliate your legs. You can use them while you are in the shower, and don’t need any special products. Simply get into a warm shower, allow your skin to hydrate in the steam and water for at least two minutes, and rub your legs with the gloves., Physical exfoliants that use salt, coffee grinds, sand, or other harsh ingredients leave tiny cuts on your skin. This is undesirable before a shave, as shaving already puts your delicate skin at risk for nicks and cuts."
"
Wash your face twice a day.,
Exfoliating is good, but over-exfoliating is not.,
Use toner to restore your skin's natural pH and tighten pores.,
Apply some moisturizer after the toner to hydrate your skin.,
Skip the long hot showers and take shorter ones using warm or lukewarm water instead.,
Pat your face and body dry with a towel after bathing.,
Use sharp, fresh razors and a shaving cream or gel when shaving.,
Protect yourself from the sun.,
Avoid using cheap, drug-store brand products on your face.,
Wear the right foundation for your skin type.",How to Have Great Skin1," Don't over-wash your face, however. You will dry out your skin, which will cause it to produce extra oils to compensate. Instead, wash your face in the morning when you wake up, and in the evening before you go to bed. Use a gentle face wash designed for your skin type. Don't use ordinary hand or body soaps; they are too harsh for the sensitive skin on your face and could lead to dryness or breakouts.


Don't wear makeup to bed. Even if you are tired and falling asleep on your feet, try to summon enough energy to clean all that makeup off. If you don't, the makeup will clog your pores. This may result in acne the following morning.;
, Ideally, you should exfoliate once or twice a week, and more often if the days are hot and humid. Exfoliating is good, because it helps scrub away dead skin cells to reveal the fresh skin underneath. It will make your skin appear less dull and more bright. However, exfoliating too often can make your skin extra-sensitive and appear red.If you'd like to try making some of your own face and body scrubs, click here.

, Soak a cotton ball with some toner and sweep it across your face. Focus on your forehead, nose, and cheeks. Avoid the eyes and mouth.


If you have sensitive skin, try to use a gentle, alcohol-free toner, or rosewater.

, This is recommended for all skin types—including oily. If you are going out for the day, consider using a moisturizer that has at least 15SPF.If you are trying to combat wrinkles, try using an anti-aging moisturizer before going to bed. If you have oily skin or acne, try finding one that is lightweight or labeled for oily skin.

, Hot water can be very damaging to your skin. It can cause your skin to lose its natural oils and become dry.

, Don't rub your skin, as this can irritate it. Instead, pat your skin dry with a soft towel. Doing this will leave some moisture on your skin. Your skin will soak up this excess moisture and stay hydrated.

, Don't use a body wash or soap. Shaving creams and gels are designed to soften and condition your skin and hair, making it easier to shave. Also, try to shave in the direction your hair is growing in, not against it. This will help prevent razor bumps and burns.

, This means wearing sunscreen that has at least 15SPF, and avoiding the sun when its rays are the strongest, which is between 10am and 2pm. If you don't like wearing sunscreen, try getting some moisturizer or foundation that has some sunscreen in it. You might also want to consider wearing a wide-brimmed hat, long-sleeved shirts, and long pants when going outside.The sun may help give you a beautiful tan, but it can also cause wrinkles, freckles, and blotches. It can also lead to skin cancer.

, This includes makeup. For many skin-care products, you often get what you pay for. Many of the cheaper brands are laden with harmful chemicals that may do your skin more harm than good. Some of the cheaper makeup brands are also more likely to clog up your skin pores, which leads to breakouts.

If you have dry skin, pass on the powder foundation and go for a cream or liquid foundation instead.
If you have normal skin, you can wear any type of foundation.

Use the right moisturizer for the environment.,
Don’t overdo it with topical treatments.,
Give your skincare products time to work.",How to Have Healthy Skin2," Bathing every day and washing your face in the morning and at night helps to fight bacteria that can cause breakouts. Soap and lukewarm water are sufficient for cleansing without irritating or drying the skin.


Use gentle moisturizing cleansers free of chemicals, preservatives, and fragrances.
Bathe up to 10 minutes for healthy skin. Long baths or showers can dry and irritate the skin.
Do not wipe or rub the skin when drying. Applying excessive pressure can remove natural skin oils.
Dab the skin gently with a clean dry towel before applying a moisturizer.

, Moisturizers that contain glycerin, mineral oil, and petrolatum contain minimal water to protect against moisture loss in low humidity. Applying moisturizer within minutes after bathing helps to trap moisture in the skin.


Using lotion or cream to moisturize in high humidity may be sufficient as the skin naturally replenishes itself.
In colder, dry climates look for lotions that do more than just moisturize. Lotions with ingredients like chamomile and lavender will help to repair cracked skin without irritating it.

, Overusing and purchasing too many types of skincare products can actually be hurting your skin. Stick to a few simple products that you like. If you are using several different products for several different treatments, you can overload your skin. Too many ingredients can actually be irritating to the skin.
Some ingredients will actually cancel out each other’s benefits.
Ingredients like the acid in salicylic or glycolic acid will actually break down other ingredients like retinol, hydroquinone, and vitamin C. This means that using products that would combine these ingredients isn’t actually helping.
Keeping it simple with fewer products will help you stick to a routine, and provide better results.

, You won’t see results right away, no matter how much the package says you will. You need to give your skin time to accept and use your skincare products.


frequently changing which products you use can also be counterintuitive. Your body needs time to get used to what you’re putting on it. Changing to a new product with a new ingredient will only take longer for you to see results.
However, adjust your regiment for the time of year. If you live in an area where you experience different seasons, you will want to adjust. For example, you may need a stronger moisturizer during the winter to combat low temperatures and dry air coming from your heater.

Exercise also helps your immune system to stay strong and fight off infections which may affect your skin.

, Make sure you’re getting your beauty rest. Not only does a proper amount of quality rest make you feel more attractive and ready for the day, it actually improves your skin and your overall health.

Getting between 7-9 hours of sleep a night will greatly increase your energy, mood, and skin’s healthiness.
When your body is able to shut down and rest and you enter the deepest stages of sleep, it produces the most growth hormones. These hormones aid in cell and tissue repair which can slow down how fast your skin ages.
Your body also rehydrates during sleep. This reduces lines and wrinkles and takes away those bags under your eyes.

Determine your skin type.,
Keep oily skin pores clear and unclogged.,
Moisturize dry skin.,
Combine treatments for a ""combination"" skin type.",How to Have a Healthy Face1," In order to have a healthy face, you'll need to understand what makes your face unhealthy. Human skin falls into four types: ""normal"", oily, dry, and combination.Your face may fall into one or several of these categories, and different parts of your face may be more dry, healthy, or greasy than others. Take a look in the mirror and review the characteristics of each skin type:


""Normal"" skin is neither dry nor oily. It should feel supple and smooth. ""Normal skin"" is characterized by few imperfections, no severe sensitivity, barely visible pores, and a radiant complexion. It does not require as much care as other skin types, although you can still take steps to keep your face healthy.Oily skin is characterized by large pores, and a greasy or shiny complexion. People with oily skin are more susceptible to blackheads, pimples, and other blemishes. It can stem from stress, overexposure to heat/humidity, or hormonal imbalances such as puberty.
Dry skin may feel taut or show flakes of dead skin. Dry skin can cause nearly-invisible pores and low face elasticity. You might notice red patches, visible lines, and a rough, dull complexion. You might have dry skin for any number of reasons: genetics, hormones, exposure to the elements, overheating, or certain medications.
Combination skin is most common. Sometimes it is oily, sometimes it is dry, and sometimes it is perfectly healthy – and these qualities may be entirely situational.. Usually, combination skin is oily in the T-zone (across your forehead, and down the nose to your chin) and normal to dry elsewhere.;
, Oil skin is naturally porous and greasy, so you want to keep chemicals and bacteria from clogging the pores. Use these tips to care for oily skin:


Wash your skin no more than twice a day and after you perspire heavily.
Use a gentle cleanser and don't scrub.
Don't pick, pop, or squeeze pimples. This prolongs healing time.
Use products labeled as ""noncomedogenic."" They tend not to clog pores.

, If your face tends to get dry, be very gentle with it to avoid irritation. Moisturize frequently to counteract the dryness, and follow these steps to keep your face healthy:


Don't scrub while bathing or drying – scrubbing a dry face may redden your complexion or break the skin. Use mild, gentle soaps or cleansers. Avoid deodorant soaps.
Apply a rich moisturizer right after bathing. Ointments and creams may work better than lotions for dry skin, but they are often messier. Consider carrying lotion with you in a bag or purse so that you can moisturize as needed throughout the day. If you are going outside, a high-SPF sunscreen to moisturize and shield yourself from UV rays.
Take shorter showers and baths – no more than once daily. Use a humidifier, and don't let indoor temperatures get too hot. Overexposure to heat can dry out your skin.
Wear gloves when using cleaning agents, solvents, or household detergents. Some harsh chemicals can irritate your skin if they are still on your hands when you touch your face.

, When your skin is oily, try to keep the grease down and use acne creams. When your skin is dry, gently moisturize it. When your skin is healthy, continue to wash it frequently to maintain the balance.

But you shouldn't feel pressure to buy expensive creams or serums simply because you fear you won't be appealing to others. You can generally find great, affordable skin care products in your local drugstore.


Beware of products that claim to be anti-aging. Aging is a natural part of life and it shouldn't be feared.
The two most effective products in reducing the effects of age on the skin are a full-spectrum sunscreen (worn every day, even when the sun isn't out) and a retinol. If a product does not have one of these two ingredients, it might not be effective at reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.The strongest retinols generally require a prescription from a dermatologist and can't be purchased over the counter.;
, The first step in achieving healthy skin is to keep it clean. You want to embrace gentle cleansers that are free from harsh detergents and alcohol. Bar soaps are generally too harsh for the delicate skin on the face.


If you have oily skin, look for foaming cleansers as these will help reduce blemishes. Ingredients such as benzoyl peroxide and glycolic acid will also help control the production of oil. You should certainly cleanse in the morning and at night; you might also want to cleanse a third time, (for example, when you arrive home from work in the early evening).
Dry skin sufferers should use gentle, creamy cleansers that are free from soap and alcohol, as these ingredients will strip the skin of precious moisture. Be sure to follow up with a moisturizer immediately after cleansing. You might find that you only need to cleanse at the end of the day.
If you have normal skin, you can use a wide range of cleansers. Use a gentle, water-soluble cleanser formulated for the face.Those with sensitive skin should avoid cleansers with fragrance, alcohol (which can be too astringent) and dyes. Look for soothing ingredients such as aloe vera or chamomile in your cleanser.

, Moisturizer will keep your skin supple and well hydrated. You will generally want to apply in the morning and before you go to sleep at night. The best formulation will depend on your skin type.


If you have oily skin, you might be tempted to skip moisturizer altogether. But often your skin produces too much oil because it is not properly hydrated. Look for moisturizers that are oil-free and have acne-fighting agents like salicylic acid. Your skin will be happiest with moisturizers that are in light gel form or a thin lotion.If you have dry skin, you should search for thicker, creamy formulations as opposed to thinner lotions or serum-based textures. Look for moisturizers that have elements like shea butter and hyaluronic acid, which are very hydrating. Ceramides are also a great ingredient for dry skin.
If you have normal skin, then look for a light, water-based moisturizer which will not disrupt the perfect balance your skin already has. Cyclomethicone, a silicone-derived ingredient, will help keep your skin glowing.If you have sensitive skin, look for moisturizers which do not contain alcohol or fragrance and are also free from dyes. These can irritate your skin and exacerbate any larger issues you might have, like rosacea or acne.

, The most important ingredient to include in your skin care routine is a good sunscreen with a minimum SPF 30; it should provide protection against UVA and UVB rays. Wearing sunscreen every day will reduce the risk of skin cancer while also diminishing the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines as you get older.


Apply your sunscreen after you apply you moisturizer but before you add any makeup, like foundation.
Wearing sunscreen will also give you an even skin tone since you won't have an uneven patches from burning.

, Exfoliation can help remove scaly, rough cells from the outer layer of the skin, revealing a shiny, new layer underneath.


You can exfoliate by using a cleanser or a face mask that has Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHAs) and/or Beta Hydroxy Acids (BHAs). If you use an exfoliating cleanser, massage it into damp skin so it can work into the outermost layer of skin. Rinse off and dry your skin with a clean face towel.
If you are using an exfoliating mask, you should follow the directions on the product, but you will most likely need to leave it on dry, clean skin for 10-20 minutes and then remove it by rinsing it with warm water.
Avoid using face scrubs that have beads or pieces of nuts (like almonds) and fruit stones. These can be too harsh and even leave harmful cuts on your skin.
If you have very sensitive or dry skin, exfoliation might be too harsh for your face.

, Facial massage has been shown to have amazing benefits for the skin, improving blood circulation and reducing puffiness around the eyes. Done over a sustained period of time, it can also reduce the appearance of wrinkles.Gently stroke the skin on your face in upward, circular motions. You can do this you apply your cleanser or moisturizer. You can also use a facial oil or a cleansing balm when you do your massage. Just make sure you are not doing it on dry skin, as this pull and damage the skin.

, You shouldn't invest in make up out of fear or insecurity. It is definitely fine to not wear any make up at all; you can still have a beautiful, pleasant face without it.

, Unless you are attending a special event or you are striving for a very edgy, experimental look, the best makeup is generally used in moderation to create a healthy, natural appearance. Make up should enhance your natural beauty rather than masking it.

, Out of all the make up products you can use, foundation is the most important because it covers the largest amount of skin. If you have a generally uneven skin tone, foundation can help improve your complexion.


Find the right formula for your skin type. If you have oily skin, you might look for an oil-free foundation that leaves a more matte finish. If you have dry skin, look for a foundation that leaves a more dewy, supple finish. Foundations generally come in liquid form, but you can also consider powder or cream formulations.You should apply foundation after your sunscreen has absorbed into your skin. You can use your fingers, a brush, or a sponge to accurately blend it in.
Be sure to pick a shade that matches your natural skin tone. Test out the foundation in natural light to see how it looks.
Resist the urge to cake it on. If you feel very insecure about your skin, you might be tempted to apply foundation all over your face and in multiple layers. But you probably don't need to apply that much, just over the uneven patches of your skin. Let some of your natural skin shine through.
If you don't want to use a formula as heavy as a foundation, you might also consider a tinted moisturizer. Tinted moisturizers will even out skin tone, but they generally do not provide the full-coverage of a foundation.

, Sometimes foundation doesn't work as well in covering problem areas such as acne or dark circles under the eyes. A creamy concealer (usually in a pot or a wand) can help reduce the appearance of these imperfections.

, If you want to add some extra color to your cheeks, you can add a little bit of blush. Generally, a peachy-pink color will look good on most skin tones, but you can choose a wide variety of shades, from deep reds to more autumnal berry shades. You should generally use a large, fluffy brush to apply blush to the apples of the cheeks.


Blushes often come in powder forms, but if you have dry skin, you might use a cream blush for a dewy finish.

, Your eyes are one of the most enjoyable areas to apply make up because you can create a very dramatic look with eye liner and colorful eyeshadows. But if you are going for a more natural look, a coat of mascara and a neutral eyeshadow (in a light beige or brown color) is universally appealing.

, If you want to add a boost of color to your lips, consider a lipstick or a tinted lip balm. Lipstick is generally the most noticeable element of make up on your face; a 2011 study from Boston University suggested that women who wore it in a professional setting were considered more confident and reliable.Generally, most lipsticks will leave a lustrous sheen on the lips, but you can also find shades in a more dramatic, matte finish (a la Marilyn Monroe). For a professional setting, a shade in a peachy-pink, light red, or coral will be more appropriate than a very dramatic shade, like a Gothic purple.
You can also just wear a lip gloss or a hydrating lip balm if you want to highlight your lips, but not draw too much attention to them.

, Nothing can highlight the beautiful features of your face more than a great new haircut. Schedule an appointment with a hairstylist to find out what kind of cut will best flatter your face shape.Round face shapes look best with hair that is cut in multiple layers. This cut minimizes the width of the face. A long bob or a piecey pixie cut will generally look flattering here.
Oval faces generally need cuts that make them appear to be less long. Blunt bangs or a center part will help these faces look fuller and more radiant.
Square faces can something look a little too severe. Soft, long waves or a straight, shoulder-length cut will help soften the jawline.
Heart shaped faces will look better with a dramatic side part or with side-swept bangs.

, Necklaces that draw the eye up to the face can also help give you a natural glow. Consider necklaces that fall in a wide circle across your collarbone as they can add a great punch to a basic outfit.


Metallic necklaces in silver and gold will automatically draw light to your face and add a great glow to your overall appearance.
Avoid clunky chokers as these break up the long line of your neck.

, Nothing can ruin your appearance more than wearing a color that makes you appear to be sallow or washed out. First, you have to determine if your skin is cool toned or warm toned.To determine your skin tone, look at the veins in your wrist. If your veins appear to be blue, you are cool-toned. If they appear to be green, then you are warm-toned. You can also think about which jewelry you prefer; if you look better in silver, you are most likely cool-toned, whereas if you look better in gold, then you are warm-toned.
Cool-toned people will generally look best in blues, greens, pinks and purples.
Warm-toned people will look best in bright reds, oranges, yellows, and ivory.

, The key ingredient to appealing to other people is to be confident in yourself first. Have faith in the fact that your face is exactly how it should be in its current state. You don't need make up, injectables or plastic surgery to be appealing to others -- you are already beautiful.


If you suffer from a lack of self-esteem, take five minutes in the morning to list five positive attributes about yourself (particularly about your appearance or body if that makes you insecure). You can write it down or say it out loud to yourself, but always remind yourself of your beauty and self-worth.

, Having a pleasant appearance to other people is less about how you look and more about how you interact with them. Consider doing the following actions when you meet someone for the first time:


Make constant eye contact when you speak with someone. Don't look down or just past the other person. Look at them directly in the eye so they know that you are truly interested in listening to them.
Smile. If you are happy to meet someone, show it. If you have confidence in a business proposal or a class presentation, then deliver it with a smile. A genuine smile has been shown to relieve stress and to convey confidence.
Smiling also makes you pleasant to be around; when you smile, you induce a reflexive-response on the part of the other person because they will want to smile backAsk questions about the other person. Nothing will convey a pleasant demeanor more than showing interest in someone else.

, In order to have true confidence, you have to value yourself and take care of yourself. Self-care is a practice in which you do things which bring you joy and fulfillment. Unlike some diet or exercise regimes which deny or restrict your body, self-care routines incorporate things which give you a sense of peace and stability while also reducing stress and anxiety. Here are some examples:


Exercise if it makes you happy. In self-care routines, exercise is not about disciplining the body or punishing it. Rather, you exercise because it brings you happiness. If you love being in nature, go for a hike or a walk in your favorite park. Yoga, pilates, running and team sports can also add to your self-care routine.
Complete morning meditations. Taking time to pause and reflect on your purpose in life can add value to your self-care routine. Before getting caught up in the rush of the day, take a few seconds to breathe and be grateful for the positive things in your life.
Give back to your community. Volunteering has been show to increase the life span of its participants while also improving your sense of confidence. When you give back to other, you gain a larger sense of purpose and a confidence in your ability to make a difference. Maintain a basic hygiene routine. Life can get very busy and sometimes we skip that daily shower or we go a little longer without doing laundry. But doing these small things can boost your larger sense of confidence, making you a more pleasant person to be around.

Wash your skin with a gentle facial wash. Use a cleanser that is based on your skin type (oily skin, combination skin, dry skin).,
Avoid washing your face with plain soap.,
Clean your face every morning and every night.,
Wash your face with an acne cream.,
Don't let sweat dry on your face.",How to Have a Healthy Face2," Avoid using harsh cleaners that strip away the natural oils of your skin. Chemicals like salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide can cause irritation and disturb the balance of hydration for your skin. Try using more natural antibacterials like honey or oats. Washing your face with the wrong products can leave it looking dull, haggard, and wrinkled.Skin-type-based cleansers are often labeled as such. As a general rule of thumb, a foam or gel wash works best for oily skin; a moisturizing cream wash works best for dry skin; and a wash with either salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide can help clear up acne-prone skin.
Consider making your own face wash. You can use a bevy of natural ingredients—many of which you may even keep in your home—that will clean, exfoliate, and moisturize your skin.

, The harsh chemicals that many soaps contain are useful to clean the skin, but not to protect it. While this works perfectly well for the rest of your body, the skin on your face is much more delicate and can easily begin to look damaged. Instead, consider investing in a high-quality face wash.


Your skin is acidic, while soap is alkaline-based. Your skin’s natural barrier is made up of acid mantle. When the pH scale shows 7, it is neutral. Anything below that is acidic, and anything above it is alkaline. Our skin’s pH balance is generally between 4 and 6.5, even when the skin is very oily.
Soap, on the other hand, is extremely alkaline and goes towards the other extreme. So, if you use soap on your skin, it messes with its pH balance and acid mantle, causing it to make skin conditions worse., Rinse with warm water and a gentle face cleanser in the sink or the shower. Use your hands and a clean washcloth to gently scrub your skin clean. Follow these steps:


Rinse your skin with warm water to open pores and add moisture.
Lather your hands with soap. Gently wash your face with your fingertips using small, circular motions. Apply more pressure on your forehead, nose, cheeks, and chin.
Using a warm, clean washcloth to repeat the circular pattern. Use enough pressure to slough off dirt and dead skin. Rinse facecloth and repeat with only water and cloth.
Splash cooler water for a final rinse to close pores. Your skin should be shiny clean and slightly pink. Apply a moisturizer and you're done.

, The combination can help keep your pores clean may take some time and continued daily treatments. Once you know your skin you have to develop a skin regime consisting of: a simple and sensitive face wash, a toner, acne medication (if you have acne-prone skin), and a simple sensitive moisturizer.


Consider using medicated acne creams that contain either salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide. These products can be highly effective at cleaning your pores of the bacteria that cause acne, but they may also strip your skin of moisture and nutrients. Be aware of the risks as well as the benefits., Directly after you work out, exert yourself, or spend time in a hot environment, use water or a clean towel to wash the sweat from your face. When sweat dries, your skin soaks up any bacteria that have been swept into the sweat."
"
Avoid touching your face, especially when it's oily.,
Treat your skin gently.,
Exfoliate once or twice a week, but no more frequently.,
Moisturize dry skin.,
Don't pick at pimples and blemishes.,
Clean your makeup brushes.,
Rejuvenate your skin with a face-mask every 1-2 weeks.",How to Have a Healthy Face3," Your fingers carry oils, and when you touch your face, the oil is transferred to your face. This can cause an acne breakout. Furthermore, your face can lose elasticity if you pull, tug or play with it. The muscles in the skin may gradually loosen and will sag; this can cause wrinkles and make your face appear less healthy. As a rule of thumb: keep your hands away from your face.

, Daily cleansing and shaving can take a toll on your skin. To keep it gentle:


Limit bath time. Hot water and long showers or baths remove oils from your skin. Limit your bath or shower time, and use warm water—not hot. Hot water can dry out your skin.
Avoid strong soaps. Strong soaps and detergents can strip oil from your skin, making it dry and flaky. Instead, choose mild cleansers.
Shave carefully. To protect and lubricate your skin, apply shaving cream, lotion or gel before shaving. For the closest shave, use a clean, sharp razor. Shave in the direction the hair grows, not against it.
Pat dry. After washing or bathing, gently pat or blot your skin dry with a towel so that some moisture remains on your skin. Try letting your face air dry before applying toner.

, Exfoliation is a great way to help shed dead skin cells, which could collect in pores and turn to blemishes. Use minimal pressure—you are only exfoliating the first few layers of skin. It is much better to exfoliate for a longer period of time with little pressure, than a short period of time with heavy pressure. Don't forget to moisturize after exfoliating.


Mix water and baking soda for a homemade exfoliating scrub. Mix equal increments of the two ingredients, then adjust the proportions until you have a thick paste. Use this once every 2-3 days for a mild exfoliation.

, If your skin is dry, use a moisturizer that fits your skin type. Use a moisturizer to restore your skin after exfoliating or after any harsh facial cleanser. You can use natural oils—coconut, avocado, tea tree, etc.—to moisturize your skin.For example, if you use a harsh cleaner without moisturizing after, your skin is left very dry. This signals your skin to produce excessive oil so that it can return to its natural state.
Make sure your moisturizer has some sun protection. Sun damage may not be a fast-acting cause of skin issues, but by using a moisturizer with at least 15 SPF, you can avoid wrinkles in the future and help slow the aging of your skin.

, Popping a pimple may seem to release all the dirt and help clean out the pore. In actuality, however, the bacteria in the pore gets pushed back further into the skin; this gradually collects in more pores, causing a chain reaction. Pimples tend to spread from a central point.If a pimple comes up, don't squeeze it; stretch it out so that the blood vessels won't open and fuse with the pus. If blood fuses with the pus, then it will be harder to clean the pores.
Always use rubbing alcohol after a pimple is open. The rubbing alcohol will not only restore moisture that is needed to keep the skin fresh, but it will clear the pus from deep within the pores. This will make it harder for pimples to return.

, If you use makeup brushes, wash them in warm soapy water every day. Bacteria can grow on unwashed makeup brushes because of the dirt and facial oils that have rubbed onto them. When you brush this bacteria back onto your face, it can lead to acne and spots. Acne can be hard to get rid of, and serious cases may leave nasty scars.


When using makeup, avoid cheap products and always use a face primer. Never forget to remove makeup before going to bed.

, This can restore and preserve your skin in a number of ways—anti-aging, spots, wrinkles, skin tone, facial glow, or even brightening—depending on the ingredients in the mask. You can buy masking materials in drugstores and beauty stores, or you can make your own from household items. Good ingredients to add include honey, lemon, milk, avocado, yogurt, oats, banana and cucumber.

Protect yourself from the sun.,
Change pillowcases often.,
Sleep on your back.,
Don't smoke.,
Eat a healthy diet.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Manage stress.",How to Have a Healthy Face4," One of the most important ways to take care of your skin is to protect it from the sun. A lifetime of sun exposure can cause wrinkles, age spots and other skin problems — as well as increase the risk of skin cancer.For the most complete sun protection:


Use sunscreen. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15. Apply sunscreen generously, and reapply every two hours—or more often if you're swimming or perspiring.
Seek shade. Avoid the sun between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., when the sun's rays are strongest.
Wear protective clothing. Cover your skin with tightly woven long-sleeved shirts, long pants and wide-brimmed hats. Also consider laundry additives, which give clothing an additional layer of ultraviolet protection for a certain number of washings, or special sun-protective clothing—which is specifically designed to block ultraviolet rays.

, Hair oils, facial oils, saliva, dandruff, dirt, and bacteria tend to settle on pillowcases, especially when you are using them heavily. These contaminants rub onto your face during the night, and the bacteria can cause your face to break out. It should be sufficient to change your pillowcase every 3-4 nights, although some people suggest that you change it every other night—or even nightly.Keep a few extra pillowcases on hand so that you don't need to do laundry just to keep your pillow fresh.
If you don't want to replace your pillowcase so often, try covering your pillow with a clean towel when you sleep. This way, you can preserve your pillowcase, but also protect your face.

, If you sleep in a supine position, your face may be less likely to rub against your pillowcase. This may help prevent dark circles, and it may keep your face from absorbing the bacteria that congregate there.

, Smoking makes your skin look older and contributes to wrinkles. Smoking narrows the tiny blood vessels in the outermost layers of skin, which decreases blood flow. This depletes the skin of oxygen and nutrients that are important to skin health., A healthy diet can help you look and feel your best. Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean proteins. The association between diet and acne isn't clear, However, some research suggests that a diet rich in vitamin C—and low in unhealthy fats and processed or refined carbohydrates—might promote younger-looking skin.Avoid oily or fried foods. Excessive consumption of salts and fats can cause fat to build up on your face, a can cause spots, zits and painful pimples. To have a healthy face you need a healthy system and this can disrupt it very badly.

, Drink two liters a day, or as much as possible. Water will help ease the stress put on your liver, which is directly related to how your skin regulates itself. It will also keep you hydrated, making your skin less likely to dry out.

, Uncontrolled stress can make your skin more sensitive and trigger acne breakouts and other skin problems.To encourage healthy skin—and a healthy state of mind—take steps to manage your stress. Set reasonable limits, scale back your to-do list, and make time to do the things you enjoy. The results might be more dramatic than you expect.

There are several options:Products with beta hydroxyl acid (salicylic acid) as the active ingredient. Medications with this ingredient may make your skin smoother by encouraging exfoliation. They may also reduce acne. Products with salicylic acid are available in both over-the-counter and prescription strengths.
Alpha hydroxyl acids (citric, tartaric, lactic, and glycolic acids). Products containing these active ingredients may reduce small wrinkles and make age spots less obvious. These products may make you more sensitive to the sun. Use sunscreen to avoid further damage to your skin.
Retinoids such as tretinoin (Retin-A, Renova) and tazarotene (Avage, Tazorac). These medications exfoliate your skin and reduces fine lines. Some people experience side effects of skin irritation including redness, swelling, peeling, dryness, itching, a burning or tingling feeling, and the sensation that your skin is tight. You may need to apply the medication every other night at first until your skin adapts. These medications also make you more vulnerable to sunburns.

, These techniques use acid to burn away the outer layer of skin. The peel can be done to different depths depending upon how deep your wrinkles are. The different depths use different chemicals. Side effects from chemical peels include redness, scarring, changes in skin pigmentation, and infections.Light peeling. This peel would only remove the outer layer of skin called the epidermis. It is used to remove superficial wrinkles.
Medium peeling. This peel would remove the epidermis and the more superficial layers of the dermis below. It would address deeper wrinkles than the light peel and the effects should last for about a year.
Deep peeling. These more powerful chemicals burn away the epidermis and reaches into the lower layers of the dermis. This is used to get rid of deep wrinkles or scars. The chemicals used for deep peels can be harmful to your heart, kidneys, and liver. Discuss these risks with your doctor before undergoing this procedure., There are several ways that doctors can fill in wrinkles or tighten muscles to reduce sagging skin. Methods include:Soft tissue fillers. These methods inject material like fat, collagen, or hyaluronic acid gel into your wrinkles to fill them in. You may have bruises, swelling, or reddening of the treated areas. After a few months the wrinkles will return.
Botulinum toxin type A (Botox). During this technique you would receive injections into the muscles that cause your skin to wrinkle when they contract. The effects usually last for a third of a year or less. A side effect is that when the muscles don’t contract, it may alter your facial expressions in ways that people may notice.
A face lift. This procedure is more invasive. The doctor removes sagging skin and eliminates pockets of fat from your neck and face. You may be bruised and swollen for weeks afterwards, but the effects generally remain for up to a decade.
Laser or light resurfacing. Energy from a laser or pulsed diode light removed the top layer of skin. This slight, but unnoticeable, skin “wounding” kicks the skin's natural collagen-production system into high gear, resulting in smoother, more wrinkle-free skin.
Chemical peels. In this treatment, a chemical is used to ""burn"" away the top layer of skin, creating damage that causes the body to respond by making more collagen. You end up with younger-looking, smoother skin.
Dermabrasion. A vacuum suction device used in tandem with a mild chemical crystal helps remove the top layer of skin cells and bring new, more evenly textured skin to the surface. In the dermabrasion process, fine lines and wrinkles seem to disappear.

As with all steps in the facial, never tug at the skin. Use gentle strokes, particularly around the eye area, where the skin is very thin and delicate.

, The cleanser you use should depend on the skin type (oily, dry, sensitive, normal, acne-prone, aging). Dermatologists recommend using one without alcohol, which can irritate the skin.Put a generous amount on your palm and run your palms over each other to evenly distribute the product for easy application. Start at the chin and work the cleanser into the face with your fingertips using a circular motion.







, If you have the money to invest in a sonic cleansing brush, use it to deep clean. These battery-powered brushes are gentle enough for facial skin, and use sonic technology to exfoliate and remove deeply-lodged impurities.Follow the product's instructions, as these may vary., You can do this with a clean, damp washcloth or a cotton pad.








, Use a clean, dry towel. Never rub the skin when drying, as this can irritate it.








, Put a generous amount of a gentle exfoliator into your palm, and wipe your palms together to distribute the product as you did with the cleanser. Apply the scrub in a circular motion onto the face and neck, but avoiding the eye area (nothing south of the eyebrow or north of the eye socket). Use a very light touch; you do not need to press the product into the skin.

, Dampen a washcloth with room-temperature water and gently remove.








, Use a clean, dry towel. Leave the skin just slightly damp.








, Dampen a cotton pad with a small amount of toner and gently sweep across the skin. Toners restore and repair skin with antioxidant and nourishing ingredients. They remain on the skin after cleansing and before applying moisturizer. There are many toners on the market, as well as homemade alternatives. You'll need to select a toner that works for your friend's skin, but whatever you choose, make sure it is alcohol-free. Alcohol can cause free-radical damage, which may actually diminish the skin's ability to produce healthy collagen.








For oily skin, you can opt for plain witch hazel.
For dry or sensitive skin, try applying almond oil as a toner.For acne-prone skin, make your own toner by mixing 3/4 cup (177 ml) strongly brewed green tea and 1/4 cup (60 ml) raw apple cider vinegar. The green tea is anti-inflammatory and antioxidant, while the vinegar restores the skin's natural pH., Use your friend's normal moisturizer, but take care in how you apply it.

Proceed with caution.,
Identify a possible threat.,
Determine if iodine may help.,
Consult a dermatologist.,
Choose the right type of iodine.,
Surround the mole with petroleum jelly.,
Apply the iodine using a cotton swab.,
Loosely cover the mole.,
Clean the area.,
Repeat daily.,
Watch for changes.,
Take note of a few special precautions.,
Stop at the first sign of irritation.,
Avoid overuse.,
Watch the area after completing the treatment.",How to Remove a Mole with Iodine," Even though iodine mole removal is a popular home remedy, it's currently an unverified one. There is not enough medical evidence to prove or disprove its effectiveness.


On the other hand, there's no evidence suggesting that the practice is dangerous, either, and using iodine is safer than attempting to shave off the mole at home. You should never try shaving off a mole, even if you know it isn't cancerous.
If you know the mole isn't dangerous and you only want to remove it for cosmetic or comfort reasons, the iodine treatment might be worth trying. You should still exercise caution when applying this treatment, though, by watching for symptoms of a negative reaction.;
, Some moles may contain cancer cells, in which case, self-removal with iodine or any other home remedy should be avoided since it could cause those cells to spread further into the body.


If you have any reason to suspect that a mole might be symptomatic of skin cancer, you should immediately schedule an appointment with a dermatologist.
Apply the ""ABCDE"" self-examination guide when examining the mole to evaluate its potential threat level.""A"" refers to ""asymmetrical shape."" Cancerous moles typically have unevenly shaped halves.
""B"" refers to ""border."" Moles that have notched, scalloped, or other uneven borders are more likely to contain cancer cells.
""C"" refers to ""color."" Consistently colored moles are often benign, but those made up of many colors or those that change color might be dangerous.
""D"" refers to ""diameter."" Harmless moles are almost always smaller than 1/4 inch (6 mm) in diameter. Moles larger than that could be cancerous.
""E"" refers to ""evolving."" Moles that change in appearance over several weeks or months could contain cancer cells.



, Even among non-cancerous moles, there are some moles that may not respond to an iodine treatment.


The iodine remedy seems most effective for deep brown moles that are slightly raised. The iodine is believed to break down some of the excess skin cells building in that area, causing an elevated mole to eventually fall off.Small, flat moles that resemble freckles are less likely to react to iodine.Note that iodine may also be more effective on moles that were accidentally cut or scraped open since it also helps prevent bacterial infections from developing in minor wounds.

, It's always a good idea to talk to a dermatologist about any mole before you attempt home treatment. This is true regardless of whether or not the mole appears cancerous.


Your dermatologist can more accurately determine whether or not the mole is a threat.
Additionally, your dermatologist can review other options for mole removal that may prove more effective. He or she should also be more familiar with your personal medical history, so if the iodine treatment does present any threat to you specifically, your dermatologist should be able to let you know.

, Purchase a topical iodine product containing only 5 percent iodine. Stronger concentrations may cause irritation, especially if you have sensitive skin.Topical iodine should be available over-the-counter at most drug stores.
You can usually find topical iodine in swab, ointment, tincture, dressing, or gel form. Any of these forms will work, but you should note that specific application instructions may vary depending on type. Check the product label for more precise dosage details before use.

, Use your fingers or a cotton swab to apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly to the skin directly around the mole. Get the petroleum jelly as close to the mole as possible without actually touching it.


Iodine will stain the skin a deep purple color. Furthermore, it may spread out slightly from the initial site of application, creating an even larger stain than anticipated.
Coating the surrounding skin with petroleum jelly prevents the iodine from dripping or spreading out and staining that area.

, Soak the tip of a cotton swab with a small amount of topical iodine solution, then rub the iodine-soaked cotton directly over the mole.


For iodine gels, creams, and other non-liquids, apply a small dot of iodine to the tip of the cotton swab and transfer it directly to the mole. Use the cotton swab to rub the iodine solution into the mole until the mole absorbs it.
A small amount is usually sufficient, and you should never use more than needed to cover the mole itself. Check the label instructions for more detailed instructions concerning proper dosage.

, Place an adhesive bandage over the mole, centering the non-adhesive pad over the mole itself. Do not apply any adhesive directly to the mole.


If desired, you can apply two bandages in a cross-cross manner to cover the area more effectively. Keep both bandages loose, though.
Do not apply bandages or other coverings too tightly since doing so could increase the risk of experiencing irritation or iodine burn. The bandage is only meant to prevent the iodine from rubbing off and staining other surfaces.

, Allow the iodine to soak into the mole overnight, or for 8 to 12 hours. Afterward, gently cleanse the area using a facial cleansing pad or mild soap.


Try to avoid scrubbing the mole too harshly since doing so may cause injury or pain. Wipe the area gently to strip away any excess iodine and dead, loosened skin cells.
Pat the area dry with a clean paper towel when done.
Note that there may still be an iodine stain even after you wash the area. That stain will likely remain until well after the treatment ends.

, Iodine won't remove the mole overnight. You'll need to repeat the treatment for seven to ten days before the mole fades or disappears.


Prolonged use of topical iodine can be dangerous, so you should not use it for more than ten days, even if the mole hasn't completely vanished yet.Follow the same steps when applying each dose of topical iodine. Only apply the iodine once a day, and try to apply it to the mole at the same time each day.

, The mole should eventually shrivel up and break free from your skin. This process will happen gradually, however, so you should monitor the area and watch for changes each day.


You may not notice any change after the first day or two, but by the fourth day, you should see some change in size or color.
If there is no visible change after seven days, the treatment isn't working effectively and probably won't be enough to remove your mole.

, Even though iodine is safe for most adults and children over the age of 14, you should avoid it if you have certain medical conditions or if you're currently taking certain medications.Do not use iodine if you're pregnant or breast-feeding.
Iodine can may also be unsafe if you have a specific type of rash called ""dermatitis herpetiformis,"" or if you have an autoimmune thyroid disease or other thyroid disorder. These conditions may all worsen with the use of topical iodine.
You should also avoid iodine if you are on an antithyroid drug, amiodarone, lithium, ACE inhibitor, ARB drug, or water pill. Similarly, avoid using topical iodine if you're already taking an oral iodine supplement to avoid an accidental overdose.

Try chemical removal.",How to Remove a Raised Mole1," Before considering removing a mole, you should have a physician examine it to determine that it is benign and not cancerous. It is critically important that you do not try to remove the mole yourself without first having it professionally examined.

, This does not involve applying flame to the mole, but rather carefully using a special medical device to deliver an electrical current to cauterize and remove the mole. This method might take several treatments to fully remove larger moles, since the electrical current only burns off a thin layer of skin.

, Some chemicals, such as salicylic acid, can be applied to a mole in order to remove it;however, it is very important that a trained physician administers this treatment. If you improperly apply salicylic acid or another chemical to your mole, burns, infection, or permanent scarring can result.

Soak your feet in warm water and scrub.,
Prepare a lemon juice soak.,
Make an Epsom salt foot bath.,
Harness the power of vinegar.",How to Remove Dead Skin from Feet2," One of the most basic solutions is to soak feet for long enough to soften the dead skin and scrub it off with a pumice stone or foot brush. Fill a foot bath or small tub with enough water to cover the tops of your feet and soak for 20 minutes. Gently scrub the dead skin off of your feet.

Soak for ten minutes then rinse and pat dry.Undiluted lemon juice will give your feet a stronger treatment than if you dilute it with water.
Make sure you don’t have any cuts or open sores on your feet as the acid in lemon juice will cause extreme burning in those areas.

When you peel the wax off in the morning, throw it away in the trash. Try to keep it from falling onto the carpet.
You can purchase socks that are specifically made for this type of overnight treatment if you don’t want to get wax on your regular socks.

, In a small bowl, mix 1 tbsp (14.8 ml) of petroleum jelly with 2-3 drops of lime juice. Gently massage this mixture onto your feet before bed and wear socks to keep it from rubbing off on the sheets.For repeated treatments, you may want to designate one or two pair of socks that are specifically for this purpose.

Do not try to shave, cut, burn, freeze, or yank off a mole at home.Your physician should always examine a mole first to determine whether or not it is cancerous; otherwise, the possible cancer could spread.,
Understand the risks before trying at-home treatments.,
Try food-based treatments.,
Try non-food treatments.,
Conceal the mole.",How to Remove a Raised Mole2," Not only that, you could cause infection and/or permanent skin scarring if you attempt to cut, pull, freeze, or burn a mole off yourself. Surgical mole removals can be expensive, and may not be covered by insurance plans, so seeking an at-home treatment can be understandable; however, they are not recommended.


Don’t cut a mole off with a knife, scissors, nail clippers, etc.
Don’t use duct tape, nail polish, your fingers, etc. to yank one off.
Don’t attempt to freeze a mole off with ice, dry ice, liquid nitrogen, etc.
Don’t attempt to burn a mole off with flame or electrical currents.

, There are various creams and other products marketed as at-home mole removal treatments. You should use these with caution, even if they are easily available at over-the-counter at pharmacies or online and described as “natural” or backed by a guarantee. Even though many of these creams contain extracts of common substances like cashew, fig, lemon, eggplant, greater celandine, and bloodroot, they can cause burning, stinging, irritation, and permanent scarring.""Natural"" does not always mean ""safe."" These products may be marketed under names such as:


Best on Earth Black Salve
Black Blood Root Salve
Curaderm
Dermatend
Pristine Touch Wart & Mole Vanish

, If you would like to try removing a mole using one or more of the foods that are often incorporated in mole removal creams, you may be able to do so safely; however, these treatments are typically not medically proven and are probably ineffective. Discuss your plans for an at-home, food-based treatment with a physician.


Traditional treatments involve using foods such as cauliflower, grapefruit, radish, walnuts, figs, vinegar, banana peel, pineapple, cashew, garlic, and honey.Make a paste or juice from one or more of these foods. Apply it to the mole daily and let it dry (approximately 10-15 minutes), then wash it off.
Some sources claim that repeated use of this treatment will cause the mole to vanish.
Some foods that contain acid or other harsh substances can cause slight burning, tingling, or stinging. If your at-home mole treatment begins to irritate your skin, stop using it immediately.

, You can also try removing a mole by applying one or more non-food substances to the site. Even if these substances are commonly available, however, they can cause scarring, burning, irritation, etc. The effectiveness of these treatments is not proven, and before attempting one, you should talk to a physician about the associated risks.


Try making a paste of baking soda mixed with castor oil.Dip gauze in the paste, cover the mole with the gauze, and keep it there overnight. Try this daily to see if your mole vanishes.
Apply a drop of iodine to the mole, twice a day for a week (or until the mole disappears). Iodine must be handled properly, and should not be ingested. It may also cause burning or irritation; if this happens, stop using it immediately.
Obtain the white juice from a milkweed plant and rub it on the mole.Be very cautious when attempting this method as some species of milkweed are known to be toxic.

, If you cannot obtain a surgical mole removal and do not want to take on the risks of at-home creams and other treatments, you can also try to “remove” the mole from sight by covering it or drawing attention away from it. For instance:Wear make up such as a concealer or powder to hide the mole. You may have to experiment with different ones to find a shade that conceals it.
It there is hair growing out of or around the mole, you can use scissors to carefully clip it away (making sure not to cut the mole itself). This can reduce the obviousness of the mole.
If your mole is in an area of your body that can be covered by clothing, you can try to choose a wardrobe that will conceal it. For instance, long sleeves can cover up a mole on your arm; wearing long pants or skirts can conceal a mole on your leg.
You may be able to distract people from looking at your mole. For instance, if you have a mole on your neck that you do not like, try wearing attractive earrings to draw attention away from it.

Rinse face wash thoroughly with room temperature water.,
Use a high-quality moisturizer after you use your face wash.,
Don’t scratch.,
Apply some aloe vera to your skin.,
Use a petroleum jelly to treat dried and/or cracked skin.,
Apply some apple cider vinegar (ACV) to your irritated skin.,
See your dermatologist.",How to Relieve Skin Irritated by Face Wash1," Incredibly hot or cold water can actually damage your skin, sending your skin cells into shock. Use room temperature water instead and just make sure that you are rinsing your face completely. If you think you might have residual soap on your face, then rinse one more time than normal.


Soap residue can clog pores just like grease and make up can, but instead of breakouts, your skin breaks down after prolonged exposure to the base soap.;
, If your face wash irritates your skin, it probably is removing too many oils. A moisturizer will add good oils back into your skin and help seal water in your skin. Dehydrated skin leads to irritation, dryness, flaking, and general discomfort. The key to a good skin care program is a good moisturizer.


Moisturizers that contain humectants (substances that reduce water loss) are very effective. Look for moisturizers with urea, alpha hydroxy acids called lactic acid or glycolic acid, glycerin, or hyaluronic acid in the ingredient list. If you find them there, then you’ve found a great moisturizer., Too often dry skin itches and we scratch and scratch and scratch. Doing so only further damages your skin and can possibly lead to secondary bacterial infections of the skin. If you develop such an infection, you may need antibiotics or at the very least you will prolong any skin issues. Fight the urge to scratch. Use other means of combating that itch., Aloe vera is a miracle plant. It alleviates discomfort associated with most skin conditions — e.g. sunburns and dry and irritated skin. You can grow your own aloe vera. If you use it in its natural form, cut one of the leaves off the plant and squeeze the gel out. Rub the gel on your irritated skin. If this doesn’t sound pleasant, you can purchase aloe vera in dozens of different brands and scents at the pharmacy or grocery store., One of the most common treatments for dry skin (caused by a face wash or not) is petroleum jelly. This jelly is gentle on the skin. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends petroleum jelly over other consumer products for mild dry skin and general irritation. It is inexpensive and can be purchased at most grocery stores and pharmacies.

, ACV is an effective antiseptic, anti-bacterial, and anti-fungal agent that fights itching.Just put a few drops on a cotton swab or ball and then spot the intended area. You can use raw, organic, and unfiltered apple cider vinegar or processed ACV.

, If your skin gets too painful, remains dry and irritated for a long period of time, or results in bleeding, see your dermatologist. They may prescribe a new hygienic program or a prescription medication for your skin type. They will also be able to identify if you have a more chronic skin issue — unrelated to your face wash — like eczema or rosacea.

Pick a soap based on your skin type.,
Pick a “type” of face soap that works for you.,
Pay close attention to your face soap’s ingredients.,
Don’t purchase face soaps with “bad” ingredients like sodium lauryl sulfate and alcohol.,
Test out several types of soap to see what suits your skin best.,
Look up consumer reviews.,
Ask your dermatologist for advice.",How to Relieve Skin Irritated by Face Wash2," Too often we just pick a face wash based off of a commercial or the recommendation of a friend with “better” skin than ours. The problem is that everyone’s skin is different, so a soap made for naturally oily skin will strip too many valuable oils from someone’s non-oily skin. Or a face wash engineered for dry skin won’t adequately remove oils accumulated over the course of a day on someone’s naturally oily face. So ask yourself this question: Is my face naturally oily or naturally dry?, Face soaps come is a variety of different types. Bars, foams, non-foaming, soap-free, cleansing balms, micellar, oil-based, and medicated. Most only require water to be activated and used effectively. Micellar face washes are already watery and only need a cotton swab or pad to be applied and removed.

, Often times, hints of lavender, coconut, or some other substance is added to face washes to make them seem more luxurious or simply to smell good. Perhaps, this doesn’t make your face dry up or break out, but it might. If you’ve recently tried a new face soap and your complexion gets worse, consider picking another soap without a scent., These two ingredients tend to be too extreme for most people. Sodium laureth sulfate is a little milder than its more extreme counterpart — sodium lauryl sulfate — but both will still irritate skin susceptible to strong soaps.If your favorite soap has these “bad” ingredients listed on the side of the package, you may want to consider switching to a different cleanser. While there is some controversy around the use of sodium lauryl sulfate, prolonged use may be linked to cancer, neurotoxicity, organ toxicity, skin irritation and endocrine disruption.T

, A great test for face soaps is to wipe your face with an alcohol-soaked cotton ball after you’ve washed your face. If you still find grease or leftover makeup, your soap probably isn’t strong enough. Keep in mind, leftover grease or whatnot may also simply signal insufficient face washing. Try washing your face again before you abandon the soap., Some consumers assume that higher price points equate to a better product, but as we’ve already established, everyone’s skin is different, so some might love an expensive product, while others won’t find them equally satisfying.Read a broad spectrum of reviews written by people who’ve used the product before you try it. See if they complain about dryness afterwards, lingering scents, breakouts, or any other dermatological issue that might send up a red flare or make your skin red and itchy., Everyone’s skin fluctuates between greasy and dry, oily and non-oily. Things like stress, climate, daily activities, contact with pollutants, and other factors can dramatically change your skin. Visit a dermatologist and ask what the best face wash is for you based on your skin type. They may even prescribe a couple of different face washes to accommodate your fluctuating skin.

Rinse your face thoroughly, rinsing at least ten times, then pat your face with a towel so that it’s damp, but no longer wet., Toner tightens up your skin and can reduce the visibility of spots and wrinkles. For it to work properly, it needs to be fully absorbed into your skin, so it should go on first after you cleanse your face. As with your choice of cleanser, make sure you choose a toner formula that addresses your particular skin type.If you’re doing a daytime routine, you can skip the next two steps and jump right to applying sunscreen., Not everyone will necessary need to apply serum as part of their skin care routine, but it’s an excellent product to use if you have very specific skincare needs that you want to target. Apply your serum before your moisturizer to ensure that the potent ingredients in your serum absorb properly.For acne issues, look for serums that include vitamin C, retinol, zinc, and salicylic acid.
For dry skin look for formulas that include vitamin E, glycolic acid, and hyaluronic acid.
To brighten your skin look for serums that include antioxidants like green tea extract.If you have very sensitive skin, swap the moisturizing and serum steps. This can help reduce skin irritation and therefore redness by preventing the full effect of your serum's potent ingredients., Starting from your neck and working your way up toward your hairline, massage in your moisturizer of choice. Be generous in the amount that you use and make sure you don’t skip this step. Moisturizer seals in everything else you’ve put on your face.


Massage in your moisturizer using upward strokes to ensure the moisturizer soaks in to your pores.Avoid your lashes. Moisturizing cream travels on its own, so avoid massaging moisturizer directly into your lashes.

If you’re beginning the day with your routine, you should end with sunscreen. Some moisturizers already include a sunscreen so you might be able to combine steps.You’ll have to wait until the rest of your products have dried – about ten minutes – to apply your sunscreen to make sure it soaks into your skin and actually provides protection.
You should apply sunscreen to both your face and your neck.

Choose a moisturizing cream or ointment that is free of alcohol, dyes, and perfumes.
Apply moisturizers several times each day. Be sure to always moisturize after bathing or washing your hands.
Avoid using harsh soaps when cleansing your face.

, Some topical creams contain calcineurin inhibitors, which can help reduce visible flare-ups and heal damaged skin.You will need a physician's prescription for calcineurin inhibitors, though you may be able to purchase milder skin-repairing creams without a prescription. These are typically moisturizers that include vitamins and antioxidants.


Common calcineurin inhibitors include tacrolimus (Protopic) and pimecrolimus (Elidel). Both of these medications are only available with a prescription.
Be aware that calcineurin inhibitors can affect your immune system. For this reason, most physicians only prescribe calcineurin inhibitors when other treatments have failed or are not feasible options.

, Some people with eczema find that silicone applications help improve eczema symptoms, thereby reducing the risk of scarring. Silicone gels and sheets are generally available without a prescription at most pharmacies and drug stores.Position the silicone gel/sheet over the scar and leave it on for 12 hours each day. Do this daily for at least three months.

Dust on or draw in your brows.,
Dust on powder.,
Press on lips.",How to Layer Beauty Products2," Starting with primer helps your makeup to stay fresh longer because it gives your makeup a good base to cling to (rather than just your skin). You can use an all over primer that’s good for your whole face, or two different primers – one for your face and one especially for your eyes. You should use a special eye primer if you’re planning on using quite a bit of eye makeup.
You can also apply lip balm during this step to prep your lips. This step is particularly important if you’re using lipstick (rather than a gloss), which can dry out your lips., Using either a foundation brush, a makeup blender, or your hand, blend on your foundation. Choose a foundation color that matches the skin on your neck – your neck is usually a shade or two lighter than your face, and matching your foundation shade to your neck prevents the rest of your makeup from looking too dark., Using a concealer, cover any discolored spots and the area under your eyes famous for those blueish bags. You can use either your hand, your foundation blush or a beauty blender to do this.Choose your concealer based on the color of the blemishes you want to conceal and by looking for opposite colors on the color wheel. So, for example, if you want to cover up the blue circles under your eyes, look for an orange-hued concealer. Cover up redness with green.You can blend your colored concealers with a bit of beige concealer to match your skin tone, but don't use a beige concealer by itself - it will make your skin look muddy.To properly conceal the bags under your eyes, apply concealer in what’s called a “Hollywood V” pattern. Start at one corner of your eye, draw a v under the middle of your eye (about an inch you’re your face) and then connect to other corner before filling in., Once you have the base for your makeup down, work on contouring with bronzer and highlighter. If you don’t normally contour, that’s fine, just move right to putting your blush on.You generally want to choose a bronzer that’s one or two shades darker than your natural skin tone. You want it to look like the natural contours of your face once you’re done blending, so don’t go too dark.

, Apply blush along your cheek bone and at the apple of your cheeks. If you’ve contoured, this is the area between where your highlighter and bronzer goes. The apple of your cheeks is the spot right above the corner of your mouth when you smile.

, There are lots of different looks you can achieve by using eyeshadow, and much of the application depends on the look you’re aiming for. Generally though, you want to use an eyeshadow brush and work from your inner corner out, feathering your shadow onto your eyelid and in your crease.Use shadows the opposite color of your eyes to make your eyes stand out. So if you have blue eyes, you should use shadows with orangey undertones. For green eyes use purples. Brown eyes are neutral so most colors look good, but blue and purple work best.To add definition to your eyes, use a light bronzer in your crease (the area halfway between your eyebrow and your lash line).
Use highlighting/contouring technique to address droopy eyes by applying highlighter above your crease and then blend a darker shadow into the fold that you want to recede. Make sure you blend these together well so it looks natural., Once your shadow is set, apply your choice of eyeliner to give your eyes definition. Black will give you the most intense definition, while brown will give you a more natural look.Make your eyes look longer by applying black eyeliner to your upper and lower lash lines. Start from the middle of your eye and work your way out to the corner of your eyes. Make sure you connect the lines on your upper and lower lash lines at the corner of your eye.To naturally define your eyes, use a black or brown pencil on the inner upper rims of your eyes only.
Don’t draw on your eyeliner in one continuous line – your pencil or brush will likely catch on your eyelid and interrupt the line. Instead, feather your eyeliner from the inner corner to the middle of your eye and then from outer corner to the middle, meeting in the middle., Once your eye makeup is finished, apply your mascara. Curl your lashes with a lash curler before you put on your mascara – this gives your lashes shape and definition before the mascara coats them. Curling them before coating them helps your lashes keep their shape and prevents them for just sticking out straight.Apply two to three coats of mascara to ensure adequate coating.

, The intensity of your eyebrows should match your eye makeup, so you want to save them for last. If you’re working on a more intense eye makeup look, go for a darker brow. A more natural look requires a lighter brow.If you’re applying brow powder, work against the grain of the hair in a powder a shade or two lighter than your natural hair color. If you’re using a pencil, feather it on by pressing harder at the root than at the end to stimulate the look of natural brows.

, Once you’re finished with your look, apply a finishing or setting powder to set your makeup and keep it fresh as long as possible. You should apply loose powder to your forehead, cheeks, chin, and nose., The final step in applying your makeup should be to apply your lipstick or gloss. If you’re using lipstick, apply it using downward strokes, moving from your cupid’s bow (the point your lips make under your nose) to the outer corners of your top lip. Then move from the outer corner of your bottom lip to the middle.You can dab a bit of lip gloss at your cupid’s bow and the middle of your lower lip for a natural looking pouty lip."

See a dermatologist.,
Receive corticosteroid injections.,
Try pressure dressings.,
Ask about laser therapy.,
Consider surgery.",How to Reduce Scarring from Eczema2," The first step to effectively treating eczema is seeing a dermatologist. A dermatologist can help diagnose your eczema (and other skin conditions), assess the severity of your condition by running diagnostic tests, and prescribe you special medications to treat your condition.You can find a dermatologist near you by searching online or asking your physician for a referral.
If you're seeing a new dermatologist, you may want to call in advance to ensure that they have experience treating eczema.

, Corticosteroid injections have been shown to improve the visible appearance of scars. Your primary care physician or dermatologist will inject the corticosteroids into the scar tissue, causing it to flatten and contract. Depending on the severity of your scarring, you may need to return for follow-up injections.Injections are typically administered over the course of three treatments at four- to six-week intervals.

, Pressure dressings are stretchable cloths that are used to wrap an existing scar to reduce its appearance. This treatment option is usually reserved for severe scarring; however, your dermatologist may recommend this treatment option if your scarring is extensive and severe. You will need to work with a specialist to receive pressure dressings. Talk to your primary care physician or dermatologist about finding a qualified individual near you.Pressure dressings should be worn continuously for approximately six to 12 months. During that time it's imperative that the dressings remain in place at all times.
Pressure dressings can be used with silicone gels/sheets to further improve the appearance of scars.

, Laser therapy attacks the red blood vessels in your scar tissue to visibly improve the appearance of that scar. Sometimes laser therapy involves surgically re-surfacing the affected area to flatten scars that are raised off the skin.Make sure the laser therapist you work with is a qualified medical professional. Ask your primary care physician or dermatologist about finding a laser therapy expert in your area.

, Extensive or severe scarring may be treated with surgery; however, this option is typically only used as a last resort when other treatment options have failed. Be aware that surgically removing a scar often leaves a temporary scar that can last up to two years before it visibly improves.Surgery should always be accompanied by additional treatments at the time of the procedure to prevent the scar from returning.
Common companion treatments include corticosteroid injections, x-ray therapy, and oral antibiotics.

Avoid scratching or rubbing the area.,
Prevent contact with allergens and irritants.,
Take medication.,
Wear wet dressings.,
Consider light therapy.",How to Reduce Scarring from Eczema3," The best way to prevent new scars from forming is to avoid contact with the affected area during a flare up. Scratching or even rubbing the area may cause the skin to break, which could lead to new scars.Anti-itch creams like calamine lotion or hydrocortisone cream may help reduce itchiness. Use these products, which are available both over-the-counter or by prescription, before moisturizing your skin.
Try to distract yourself any time your skin itches intensely. You might do this with music, television, or physical distractions like pinching or gently slapping another (unaffected) part of your skin.
You should also ensure that your clothing does not rub the affected area(s). Opt for loose, soft clothing instead of tight, rough clothes., Many people with eczema also experience adverse reactions to allergens and irritants on their skin. The allergens/irritants will vary from person to person, and a dermatologist or allergy specialist can help you determine what your skin responds to most adversely.Common allergens that affect eczema include pollen, pet dander, and dust mites.
Some common irritants include wool, synthetic fiber, certain soaps and detergents, cosmetic products, body fragrances, and lanolin oil.
Choose mild soaps/cleansers or cleansers that do not contain soap. You may also want to try using less soap/cleanser than you normally use.
Hot water can cause eczema to flare up. It's best to use lukewarm water when bathing or washing your hands and to limit the amount of time you spend in the shower or bath.

, If you're seeing a dermatologist for your eczema, you will probably receive a prescription for some type of medication. The medication your physician prescribes may be used to reduce itchiness, improve inflammation, or prevent infections.Be sure to let your dermatologist know about any existing medical conditions and any other medications you may be taking.


Some dermatologists prescribe antibiotics to prevent or treat a skin infection caused by itching. If prescribed an antibiotic, be sure to complete the entire regimen as prescribed, even if your symptoms start to improve.
Corticosteroids may be prescribed for oral, topical, or injected use.
Taking oral allergy medication may help reduce itchiness on the affected area. You can purchase over-the-counter allergy medication, such as cetirizine (Zyrtec), fexofenadine (Allegra), or diphenhydramine (Benadryl), at most pharmacies.

, Wet dressings are applied topically to the affected area. This treatment method has been proven to be effective in many people with eczema. The topical corticosteroids and wet bandages applied as a wet dressing soothe the skin and reduce the need to scratch, thereby preventing potential future scars.Wet dressings can reduce the symptoms of eczema in as little as a few hours, though some people may take several days or weeks before symptoms improve.
Talk to your dermatologist about whether wet dressings could work for you.

, Light therapy has been proven effective for most adult cases of eczema. Light therapy may utilize natural ultraviolet (UV) light through regulated exposure to sunlight, or it may involve artificial UV light; however, long-term exposure to UV light (including through medically-supervised light therapy) has been linked to premature aging of the skin and an elevated risk of skin cancer.Never use light therapy for children or infants, as the harmful effects significantly outweigh any potential benefits.

Develop your routine for youthful skin early.",How to Reduce the Signs of Aging1," Your face is, of course, the first thing people will notice about you, and facial wrinkles are one of the primary signs of aging. Damaging UV light from the sun is a major cause of premature aging. The same rays that give you a tan also cause damage to your skin, which shows up as wrinkles, lost elasticity, changes in texture, and brown spots. Use a sunscreen or facial moisturizer with broad-spectrum UV coverage – SPF 30 or higher – on a daily basis.On particularly sunny days, wear a wide-brimmed hat if you’ll be outside for a while.
Never use a tanning booth, which blasts your skin with UV rays.Look for sunscreen containing zinc or titanium oxide.Self-tanning lotions are a safe alternative to baking in a tanning booth if you want a quick bronze.
In addition to aging your skin, unprotected sun exposure can also lead to cancer.;
, Before spending money on expensive products, which may irritate your skin, try easy to do natural remedies in the comfort of your home. Fruit and food items have been used for thousands of years as organic beauty products. Many common food products contain vitamins and antioxidants that protect and nourish skin.


Massage coconut oil or a teaspoon of olive oil into your skin nightly before bed. These are rich moisturizing oils that can lighten wrinkles and tighten loose skin.Make a natural face mask of one banana, a teaspoon of orange juice and a teaspoon of plain yogurt. Apply your mask for 15 to 20 minutes.Bananas hydrate your skin and yogurt contains vitamins that can lighten your skin and help cell growth and regeneration.Make a natural face mask with one egg white, a teaspoon of fresh lemon juice, and half a teaspoon of honey. Apply your mask for 15 to 20 minutes.Honey and lemon juice work as exfoliants while eggs hydrate your skin and shrink your pores.Do not use anything on your skin that you're allergic to, such as eggs. If you have sensitive skin, do a patch test by applying your homemade remedy to a dime-sized area of skin first to ensure you don't have a reaction.

, Our environment is fraught with pollutants like smoke, ozone, and gasoline fumes. These can age skin and cause premature wrinkles.Wash your face with a gentle soap each evening to remove the day’s pollutants.

, Dry skin can look flaky, dull, and can accentuate wrinkles. Incorporate a good facial moisturizer into your routine to keep skin hydrated.Apply after you wash your face in the evening, and in the morning before you start your day.


Remember, using a moisturizer with UV protection is an added bonus for your skin.

, There are many products out there that claim to decrease signs of aging, but look for those with ingredients that are more scientifically shown to do so. Alpha-hydroxy acids and retinoids are the most reliable ingredients to make skin look younger, so look for products with one of these as they primary ingredient.


Alpha-hydroxy acids like lactic, glycolic and citric acids exfoliate your skin, removing dead skin cells and speeding up the rate that your body makes new, healthier skin cells.Retinol is a form of vitamin A found in nature that helps increase the thickness of the skin and make it more elastic, which minimizes wrinkles and fine lines.Tretinoin (sometimes branded as Retin-A or the milder Renova) is a stronger form of retinol that is only available by prescription.Exfoliating with topical vitamin C in the morning may repair discoloration and lines caused by the sun’s damage. Applying vitamin C to the skin can sometimes cause dryness or flaking. If this happens be sure to moisturize well after application, or switch to taking an oral vitamin C supplement., Irritation and inflammation of the skin can make skin look less healthy and make signs of aging more apparent. Some facial products are rough on sensitive skin, and using too many products on your face can really irritate the skin. “Anti-aging” products are especially likely to cause irritation when combined. It’s okay to shop around and experiment, but settle on a beauty routine with minimal overlapping products and stick to it., The skin around the eyes is thin and sensitive, and is very prone to UV radiation.Sagging, baggy, or thinning skin around the eyes can make your face look older. When you’re going to be outside in the sun, wear sunglasses to protect this sensitive skin and keep it healthier and younger looking.

, If you regularly sleep on your stomach or on one side, you’re pressing the skin of your face into your pillow all night long. Those creased lines you get in the morning from your pillow, sleep lines, can turn into wrinkles.Sleep on your back to avoid this excess stress on your face’s skin.


If you simply can’t sleep on your back, invest in pillowcases made of satin or high thread counts to minimize sleep lines., If you have the desire and the funds, you can pursue medical procedures aimed at creating a more youthful appearance in your face. As with any medical procedures, there are certain risks. Speak with your doctor about whether these methods are right for you. In general, it’s safer to use natural remedies and healthy lifestyle than chemical procedures. Some aesthetic procedures include:Botox: Injections into the muscles underneath wrinkles in order to let the skin on top lie smoothly. It’s typically used on the top half of the face (lines on the forehead, between the eyes, crow’s feet, etc.).
Wrinkle fillers: Wrinkles are filled with a variety of substances, including collagen, hyaluronic acid, and others. It’s usually used on the lower half of the face (laugh lines, thin lips).
Chemical Peels: Chemicals are used to “burn” away the top layer of skin. Your body responds to this damage by creating more collagen.
Dermabrasion: A vacuum suction device and chemical crystals are used together to remove your top layer of skin, which evens out the skin’s texture.
Laser treatments: The energy produced by a light source removes the top layer of skin, which encourages collagen production., The best treatment for aged looking skin is prevention. Start a healthy skin routine in your younger years or when you first notice signs of aging for best results. Experts suggest the top 6 elements of a youthful skin routine are sunscreen, a gentle cleanser, a toner, a moisturizer, retinoids, and antioxidants to fight free radicals."

Don’t neglect these other parts of your body in your care routine. Moisturize daily and use the same sunscreen of SPF 30 or higher on a daily basis for exposed skin. The thin and delicate skin of your neck is a major place that will show age, possibly even before your face will. This skin may benefit from a moisturizer with peptides, to help collagen production.You can draw attention away from your neck by wearing a long necklace or blouses with interesting prints of designs.
If you choose to pursue medical treatment, fraxel laser treatments can help the texture of your skin and Botox can soften those vertical lines., Many people complain that their hands portray their aging due to thinning skin that can look and feel papery. Your hands can benefit from products containing retinoids just like the skin of your face. Use an ultra-moisturizing cream plus a hand cream containing retinol; using a dollop of your facial moisturizer on your hands in the morning and evening is an easy remedy. As with other skin, protect your hands from UV rays with an SPF 30+ moisturizer, or accessorize with a pair of gloves when outdoors.Consult a dermatologist about whether these procedures are right for you.


Draw attention away from aged looking hands by skipping dark nail polish in favor of paler shades.There are rejuvenating procedures for your hands that use lasers or injectable fillers; these procedures can thicken skin that is thinning and remove dark spots.

, Wrinkled, sagging skin on your knees and elbows can show your age. Massage onto the area high-moisture lotion that contains urea or ammonium lactate, ingredients which help penetrate the thick skin on elbows and knees. Exfoliate using a cream for that purpose, or a brush or loofah. Do yoga several times weekly - yoga strengthens your joints and leg muscles, which tighten the muscles and skin around your knees.Skin-tightening injections for elbows and ""knee lifts"" are medical procedures available from plastic surgeons.

, Breasts sag with age, but wearing the appropriate bra can help them fight gravity and appear younger. Check your bra at home by standing sideways in front of a mirror. Bend your elbows to 90˚ and notice where the fullest part of your breasts fall. This should be about midway between your elbows and your shoulders. If they're below that level, tighten your bra straps. If you do that and they still fall low or it causes your bra to hike up in back, this isn’t the right bra for you.When purchasing a new bra, request a professional fitting to learn your correct size. This might be different now than when you were 25 years old. Try on multiple styles, and aim for supportive cups.

, Brows and lashes can thin after years of plucking and with your changing hormones, which can make your face look more aged. Fill in thin or sparse brows with a pressed eye shadow that matches your hair color. Use a small brush and light strokes. Utilize a lash-enhancing mascara or try out false eyelashes for a more youthful pop to your eyes.Droopy eyelids and fat around the eyes can be caused by oxidative stress, which is usually a result of poor diet full of processed foods. Switch to a whole foods diet of fresh rather than processed foods to reduce puffiness around the eyes and decrease inflammation. Celery is a particularly good snack for this., Teeth that are stained and yellowed are a sign of age, and a bright healthy-looking smile can take years off your appearance. Whiten your teeth by brushing with a whitening toothpaste twice daily, using a whitening tray or strips, or visiting your dentist for a cleaning and bleaching procedure. Avoid smoking and drinking black coffee and tea, which worsen stains. Of course, remember to floss daily., We all know that aging causes gray hair, but it also causes hair to be thinner, drier, and finer.Over-styling to compensate can further dull hair and cause damage, and over-washing dries hair out. Getting a color or highlights at a salon is always an option, as is dyeing your hair yourself at home, but coloring may cause damage to hair, as well. Try to reinvigorate your hair without chemicals, if possible. If you experience sudden or rapid hair loss, see your doctor to ensure there's no medical reason; getting a blood test can help pinpoint if you're deficient in certain nutrients or low in thyroid hormone, which can cause thin or brittle hair.


Hair products containing caffeine, niacinamide and panthenol can help decrease indications of aging hair.Volumize hair to counteract the thinning that happens with age. Many shampoo, conditioning, and beauty product lines promote hair thickening.

Get your beauty rest, literally.",How to Reduce the Signs of Aging3," Your diet significantly affects how you look and feel like you're aging. Eating a healthy, “anti-aging” diet will fight free radicals to reduce signs of aging. Drink plenty of water (8-12 glasses a day) and eat eight to ten servings daily of fruits and vegetables. Avoid processed foods and sugars, which contain chemicals that can cause your skin to age prematurely.Specific “beauty foods” have been shown to benefit your look, as well.


Dine on salmon three times a week or other fish containing omega 3 fatty acids like tuna, trout, herring or mackerel.Excellent fresh produce for skin health include: pears, blueberries and other berries, tomatoes, beans, dark chocolate, apples, artichokes, carrots, red grapes, pecans, black plums, and the spice turmeric.Broccoli, cabbage and avocado are some of the best produce for age defying.Healthy and youthful looking hair requires protein, omega-3’s found in fish, vitamins A and C that you get from green leafy vegetables like kale, and zinc, which is abundant in nuts.If your skin has been damaged from sun exposure, incorporate soy into your diet regularly., Vitamins and nutrients aren’t just important for your overall health, some of them can aid in keeping skin looking youthful. Selenium fights free radicals and can help prevent wrinkles. Copper, which you shouldn’t eat but can come in a cream form, can improve fine lines and damage from the sun. Ingest enough calcium to inhibit premature skin aging and help skin to rejuvenate.Consult your doctor about your diet and take supplements if you do not get the daily requirements from your food.

, If you’ve ever seen a doctor, they’ve probably told you that exercise is important to keep your heart healthy and lower cholesterol. Fortunately, getting your blood pumping carries oxygen and nutrients to your skin, which helps cell turnover and promotes a youthful look. Gentle weight training can increase muscle strength and tone to give you a leaner, more youthful look.Ideally, adults should get 30 minutes of moderate exercise every day.Exercise in a way that’s enjoyable for you. Walk or jog, ride a bike, swim, do aerobics or pilates, or workout at home with light weights or simple exercises like squats and push ups.
Consult with your doctor before beginning a new exercise program.

, Stress releases a hormone called cortisol in your body.Cortisol is a major aging hormone that affects multiple body systems and can cause weight gain, interfere with sleep, and harm your circulatory system.Lower your stress level by doing yoga, meditating, reading, singing – whatever calms your nerves. Your physical and aesthetic body will benefit.

, It’s not news that smoking is unhealthy. Smoking cigarettes, however, can also increase how your skin ages. Studies suggest that you can correlate getting early wrinkles with how much you have smoked and for how long. Smoking removes oxygen and nutrients – the opposite of the positive effects of exercise – and increases free radicals in your body, so quit smoking to improve both your health and appearance.Talk to your doctor if you need help to quit smoking. There are gums, patches, and medications that can make it easier.

, Get at least 8 hours of sleep each night to help avoid getting wrinkles. Your body needs 7-8 hours of sleep to repair itself, and this includes your skin. It also matters when you sleep, since most regeneration happens between 10pm and 2am. Go to bed between 9pm and midnight to make a difference in when you get wrinkles."

Identify your skin concerns.,
Determine if you are at risk of side effects.,
Decide what type of treatment you want.",How to Treat Skin with Glycolic Acid1," Glycolic acid is primarily used to treat signs of aging and acne, but there are many uses for glycolic acid. Before you use it, make sure that it is the right treatment for your particular skincare concerns. Glycolic acid is commonly used to treat:

Wrinkles and fine lines
Sun damage, including dark spots and freckles
Acne and blackheads
Scars, including icepick and rolling acne scars
Bumpy or rough skin textureLentigines (also known as liver spots)
Melasma
Large pores;
, Glycolic acid can be effective for many skin conditions, but it can be a skin irritant as well. Redness, irritation, increased sensitivity to the sun, burning or stinging sensations, and itchy skin may be side effects. It is important to determine if using glycolic acid will be beneficial for your skin or not.


If you have a darker complexion, a chemical peel may affect the coloration of your skin. Consult your dermatologist to see if you are at risk.If you have sensitive skin or rosacea, glycolic acid may worsen your condition rather than improve it.If you have had cancer on your face, such as melanoma, you should consult your dermatologist before starting any glycolic acid treatment.
Do not use glycolic acid if you have a current or active fungal, viral, bacterial, or herpes infection.Like all alpha hydroxy acids, using glycolic acid will make your skin more susceptible to sun damage. You may also burn more easily while using this product. Make sure that you wear sunscreen while using this product.

, Before you select a glycolic acid product, you will need to determine which type of treatment will work best for you, your routine, and your skin.

If you are looking for immediate results, a glycolic face peel may be what you want. A high-percentage solution of glycolic acid is applied to the skin of the face, which subsequently blisters and peels off. The newly revealed underlying layer of skin is smoother and contains fewer blemishes and wrinkles.While glycolic acid peels will exfoliate your skin, continued application over time in daily products will combat the signs of aging by regenerating the collagen beneath your skin and improving the thickness and tone of your epidermis.Try a cream, cleanser, toner, or exfoliating face wash. These will have lower concentrations of glycolic acid, but they are safer for long-term use.

Establish a glycolic acid skincare regimen.,
Find a product with a mild percentage of glycolic acid.,
Apply glycolic acid cream.,
Clear up your face with glycolic acid facial cleansers.,
Make your own mask at home.",How to Treat Skin with Glycolic Acid2," Glycolic acid can be used in any part of your skincare regimen. To make sure that your treatment is effective, you should make sure that you have a strong skincare regimen with a cleanser, serum, moisturizer, and SPF. Any or all of these components can contain glycolic acid.

Glycolic acid is extremely common in skincare products. Read the ingredients of on the label or box to see if glycolic acid is one of the active ingredients. If it is, the label should also tell you what percentage is used.
If you want, you can also use glycolic acid eye creams, face masks, acne sprays, or spot treatments as well.

, Various types of skincare products will contain different levels of glycolic acid. Generally, products with less than 10% are considered safe and effective for daily, home use.If you have sensitive facial skin and are concerned about damaging or scarring your face, look for a facial cream that contains an amino acid, such as arginine. This protein will allow the acid to soak into your sensitive skin more slowly and so reduce potential stinging or skin discoloration.Almost any part of your skincare routine can contain a product with glycolic acid. This includes toners, cleansers, moisturizers, serums, and creams.

, If you are concerned about wrinkles, fine lines, or other signs of aging, you can prevent them using a glycolic acid cream. Apply it at night before you put on your moisturizer. If your skin does well with it, you can start using it during the day after about a month.A cream can help prevent or minimize fine lines. While it cannot remove deep lines, such as laugh or frown lines, it may be able to soften them or reduce their appearance. You’ll need to turn to a medical procedure like laser treatment, dermal fillers, or Botox to remove deep-set lines.

, A face wash with glycolic acid can help reduce and prevent acid over time. Because the concentration is lower, this is a better treatment for those with sensitive skin.Wash your face with it in the morning, at night, and after sweating heavily.

, Glycolic acid is found naturally in honey, sugar, and lemon. You can make your own natural mask at home using these common ingredients. Mix one part honey to one part raw sugar, and add the juice of half a lemon. Apply to your face, avoiding your eyes. Leave it on for five to ten minutes before rinsing off."

Start with a weaker concentration.,
Prepare your face.,
Apply the solution onto your face.,
Leave the solution on your skin.,
Neutralize the acid.,
Visit the dermatologist instead.",How to Treat Skin with Glycolic Acid3," The strength of the peel is determined by the percentage of glycolic acid in the product. When you first start doing glycolic acid peels, you should use the lowest concentration available. Over time your skin will build tolerance to it, and you can gradually move up to higher concentrations.


Glycolic acid peels start around 20% and go all the way up to 70% concentrations.Start with the 20% solution, and go up in small 5 or 10% increments in following sessions, as long as your face is able to tolerate it.
Glycolic acid peels should only be done every two to four weeks. You might try to do it once every fifteen days for up to six months or until you achieve your desired results.

, Make sure that your face is clean. There should be no open wounds, cold sores, or cracked skin. Using daily retinoids (such as Differin or Retin-A) up to ten days before the peel may help ensure a more even application., Use a facial brush or cotton balls to gently apply the acid to your face. Start at your forehead and move in a counterclockwise direction to your left cheek, chin, and right cheek. Avoid putting it near your eyes, nostrils, and lips.Test the glycolic acid solution on a small part of your face before you put the peel over your entire face. Leave it there for five minutes. This will let you see how well you react to it.

, Consult the label of the peel to learn how long you should leave it on. This is typically three to five minutes. If you are just starting out, you may only be able to keep it on for 25 to 40 seconds. If this is the case, you can try to extend the length of time in subsequent sessions slowly until you can tolerate the peels for three to five minutes.

The acid will cause your face to sting. If it bothers you, you can use a fan to blow air on it. If the stinging is so bad that a fan does not help, wash it off immediately with water. Cool (but not cold) compresses may be help to reduce itching afterwards.
Sometimes you may notice white patches on your face. These are called frosting, and they show that the peel is working. Do not leave the acid on too long after you notice frosting. If you see frosting, wait for a few seconds before neutralizing the acid.
Your skin may be red for a few hours afterwards. If your skin starts to peel, do not pick at it. You can put on a soothing moisturizer on afterwards. Make sure you wear sunscreen, even if it is not bright outside.

, Most peels will include a special neutralizing agent. Apply this once you have waited the appropriate amount of time. If there is no neutralizing agent, use cool water to wash the acid off of your face., If you are nervous about doing your own glycolic acid peel at home, you can get it done at the dermatologist office. Not only are they experienced in performing glycolic acid peels but they can safely handle higher concentrations. They may also be able to provide assistance if you have irritation, redness, pain, or discoloration afterwards."

Combine daily treatments with occasional peels.,
Use sunscreen after applying glycolic acid.,
Discontinue the use of glycolic acid in the case of irritation.,
Give your skin time to get used to glycolic acid.,
Avoid initial daily usage if you have sensitive skin.",How to Treat Skin with Glycolic Acid4," For the best results, you should have both a daily routine that incorporates glycolic acid products with glycolic acid peels every two to four weeks. This will give you the long-term benefits of creams and cleansers while providing instant results after the peel., After you’ve used a facial treatment which contains glycolic acid—whether it was in a facial wash or a facial peel—your skin will have increased sensitivity to UV light. In order to compensate for this and to reduce potential damage to your skin, apply high-SPF sunscreen if you’re going to be in the sun after using glycolic acid.The increased UV sensitivity occurs as an effect of all AHAs, as these abrasive chemicals wear away layers of outer skin that would otherwise protect your face from UV rays.

, If your skin becomes very red or you experience frequent dryness in the areas of skin that you apply the glycolic-acid peel or wash to, you should stop using the product. Skin care products containing glycolic acid may leave your skin with a light tingling or slight redness, but if you note side effects any more pronounced, stop using the product.Also plan to discontinue using the glycolic acid product if you develop any other skin conditions, ranging from eczema or a rash to raised hives or bleeding.

, Since glycolic acid is an abrasive substance which can irritate or damage your skin, it’s safest to start out using a low-percentage product. If your skin responds well to this, then you can safely use a product with a higher percentage of glycolic acid. If you start out using a product with a high acid percentage, your skin may develop a flaky crust-like layer as protection against the acid.If your face peels following the application of a product containing glycolic acid, do not pick at your skin. Breaking or tearing skin can result in scarring or hyper pigmentation.
To avoid hyper pigmentation after a glycolic acid treatment, wear sunscreen and a hat, even if it is not sunny outside.
If red or dry skin conditions persist after discontinuing the use of glycolic acid, schedule an appointment to see your physician or a dermatologist.

, Individuals with sensitive skin should not apply a product containing glycolic acid daily, as the abrupt introduction of the acid can damage your skin. Unlike scrubs, the glycolic acid does not damage low layers of skin, but will dissolve the upper layer, which can lead to reddened or peeling skin. You’ll reduce the likelihood of skin irritation if you begin by applying the glycolic acid product every other day.After a month of non-daily usage, you can begin applying the glycolic acid product daily.

Plug in the vacuum.,
Attach a nozzle of the appropriate size.,
Place the tip of the nozzle directly over a blackhead.,
Activate the suction.",How to Use a Blackhead Vacuum1," Electric vacuums run off of your home’s AC power to generate powerful suction. Make sure the vacuum is plugged into a nearby electrical outlet, or that the battery is fully charged. If your vacuum has a separate power switch, leave it in the “off” position for now.


Check for a light display that indicates that your vacuum is connected and charged.;
, Most pore vacuums come with a variety of attachments that are designed to be used on different types of blemishes. Examine the blackhead you’re attempting to remove to choose an attachment that will get the job done. Snap the nozzle into place on the front end of the vacuum and make sure that it’s secure.Choose smaller attachments for single, pin-sized spots and larger attachments for big clogs and troublesome clusters.
Your electric vacuum may come with a one-size-fits-all nozzle. The opening of this nozzle will be large enough to cover the blackhead and a small portion of the area around it.

, Position the vacuum over the blackhead so that it’s completely enclosed by the nozzle. Try to hold the vacuum perpendicularly so that the nozzle is flush with the skin. This will help form a secure seal, making the suction more effective.For best results, suction one blackhead at a time.
You might have to move the vacuum around a bit when working around the contours of the nose, cheeks and chin to find the best angle.

, Switch on the vacuum. You should feel a gentle tugging sensation as the suction begins to pull at your skin. After a few seconds, the steady suction will loosen and pull out the compacted dirt and oil that’s clogging the pore. Repeat as many times as needed until you’ve eliminated the worst of the blackheads.After extracting the biggest part of the blackhead, run the vacuum lightly over the surrounding skin to suck out any other small clogs and potential trouble spots.
Follow the cleaning instructions included with your blackhead vacuum to sanitize the unit after each use.

"
"
Select the right nozzle.,
Push the plunger in all the way.,
Target a blackhead with the tip of the nozzle.,
Push down with the shaft of the vacuum.",How to Use a Blackhead Vacuum2," Go through the different nozzles included with your manual vacuum to find one that fits the blackhead you’re trying to get rid of. On manually-operated models, nozzles tend to be easy to attach and detach, simply sliding into place. You may need to twist the nozzle attachment after sliding it in in order to secure it.


There may be a removable rubber ring that fits onto the end of the vacuum’s nozzle to enhance suction. Make sure this ring is fitted snugly over the nozzle.
Sterilize the tip of the nozzle with rubbing alcohol prior to use to avoid spreading bacteria to your pores.

, On the rear end of the vacuum you’ll find a long plunger that slides into the shaft of the vacuum. When you push this plunger in, it engages the spring mechanism that’s responsible for creating suction. You’ll then be able to suck out blackheads one at a time by making separate passes.Push the plunger in until the stopper rests against the rear edge of the shaft. Listen for a click as it locks into place.
When the spring mechanism is released, it will create about a pound of pressure—enough to yank most stubborn blackheads out of their hiding places., Rest the tip of the vacuum over the blackhead you’ve got your sights set on. Make sure the tip is pressed firmly up against your skin, with no spaces for air to enter or escape the nozzle. This will be easiest to do when the vacuum is held at a ninety degree angle.If the tip of the nozzle doesn’t form a seal, it won’t be able to generate suction needed to extract the blackhead.

, In one smooth motion, slide the shaft of the vacuum toward your face so that the nozzle is pressed into the area around the blackhead. This will extend the plunger, creating pressure on the surface of the skin that will force blackhead gunk up through the pore. From there, the vacuum’s suction will lift out the blackhead whole.There may be slight tinge of discomfort as you activate the vacuum. This happens because the suction is concentrated on such a small area of skin. To alleviate this discomfort, make the action as quick and smooth as possible.If the vacuum works the way it’s supposed to, you should be able to see whatever dirt, oil or pus it’s collected inside the transparent inner chamber of the nozzle.
Rinse out the nozzle with soap and hot water after each use to clean it.

Avoid popping or picking at blackheads.,
Wash and dry your face regularly.,
Apply a moisturizer.,
Use products that contain salicylic acid.",How to Use a Blackhead Vacuum3," When you’re trying to get rid of blackheads, pimples and other imperfections, your best bet is to use long-term preventative solutions like frequent washing and moisturizing. Rough handling can enlarge pores and rupture the tissues beneath the epidermis, causing scarring, bruising or discoloration.Always treat blemishes by washing and moisturizing as your first course of action. Clean, dry skin is your best defense against pimples and blackheads, both of which are caused by the buildup of dead skin, dirt and oil.
Never squeeze or dig at blackheads with your fingernails in an effort to extract them. This can cause permanent damage., Lightly scrub your skin with a gentle soap or acne cleanser and lukewarm water. Focus on problem areas like the nose, cheeks, chin and forehead where blackheads and pimples tend to pop up most often. You should aim to wash your face at least twice a day, or more if you have particularly oily skin.Scrubbing your face with a soft-bristled exfoliating brush will reach down into the pores to clean more thoroughly.Water that’s too hot or cold can be hard on sensitive skin.

, Moisturizers soften the skin and promote elasticity and resilience. This is especially important if you deal with blemishes on a regular basis, as they’ll help repair the damage that’s been done in the past and prevent future breakouts. Lather on a moisturizer after you shower, or before you go to bed at night.Choose a moisturizer that’s suited for your individual skin type and apply it using a delicate circular motion with the pads of your fingers.
When coupled with rigorous washing, moisturizing will enhance your skin’s ability to breathe, making it harder for dirt and oil to become trapped in your pores.

, Salicylic acid is a naturally-occurring compound that can help evict blackheads by loosening their grip on the pore. It also serves to clear away dead skin cells, which are part of the natural residue that collects to form large, stubborn blackheads. Regular treatment with creams and serums that have salicylic acid as a key ingredients will keep your skin healthy, smooth and acne-free.Many popular skincare brands (including Aveeno, Olay and Neutrogena) make acne-fighting cleansers that contain an effective dose of salicylic acid.Aggressive use of salicylic acid can cause dryness, redness or irritation. Use salicylic acid in low concentrations no more than once a day."

Put water in a pan and bring to a rapid boil.,
When water is at a rapid boil place a clean towel on your head and bend over the steam.,
Go to a mirror and look at your face.,
Apply a small amount of Johnson's Baby Oil by Johnson+Johnson to a cotton ball.,
Wash hands.,
Take a moisturizer, stay away from oil-free as they are not good for skin (Yes, I am calling the bluff), and squeeze a dime-size amount on hand.,
Repeat once every week and increase amount to 2 days a week.,
Congrats!","How to Treat Your Skin with Steam, Baby Oil and Moisturizer"," The more water the longer it will last at a boil, so, put enough in for 8 minutes. Usually, about 3 inches (7.6 cm) of water from bottom of pan. While water is coming to a boil, wash your hands, use clean tissues to wrap your fingers, and pop all your zits. Yes, pop them. For further understanding for this madness, read in the 'tips'.






;
, DO NOT BURN YOURSELF. Starts about three feet away and slowly get closer. Remember to take deep breaths while you do so because the steam can HURT the back of your throat. Once you get in a comfortable distance, stand bent over the water for 8 minutes. By the time you are down to the last 1 1/2 min. there should be drops of water falling from your face. On average, 5-7 drops total.








, Your problem areas will be showing extremely well. Take your clean towel and pat your face dry. The key is to pat! Rubbing irritates the skin.








, The amount being poured on the cotton ball should equal a dime-quarter. Dab the cotton ball on problem areas (as not to over use the product in one area) then use the cotton ball to spread over entire face. No matter the skin type. Keep watching your skin. The Johnson Baby Oil will make your problem areas stand out even more. Not just acne, but also dry skin.








, To make sure most germs and oil are either killed or gone sing your ABC's. It should take about 20 sec. which is the amount of time it takes for germs to die.








, Now, take a finger from the other hand and place in your new dime-size amount of moisturizer. Take the finger and dab the moisturizer on problem areas only. You should end up with, around, 15-30 dots of moisturizer on your face. Smooth out the moisturizer over entire face. This keeps more moisturizer on the problem areas and less on your real skin, making your skin more even in the long run.Don't use face moisturizers with sunscreen mixed in. Sunscreen can increase acne aggression. So use moisturizers with natural and vitamin rich ingredients. Cetaphil is a great product to use, unscented would be best.








, Until you skin is clear. Then you can determine for yourself how often you choose to do it. Clear skin is easy to maintain and if you over clean skin then it'll lead to damages.








, You are done. Please read the 'tips' and 'warnings' sections for safety reasons!

Use high quality razors that are customized for your particular situation.,
Open your pores with warm water.,
Always use shaving cream, lotion, or gel.,
Use correct shaving techniques.",How to Treat Razor Burn1," The gender specific ones are really nice, but make sure they are affordable enough to make discarding them after a few uses.;
, If the skin is softened from the heat and/or steam, it will make your results much better. Rinsing with warm water is also recommended.








, This reduces inflammation by keeping the area lubricated. Ideally you would want to use a badger-type brush to sufficiently apply the cream.









Leave the shaving cream on for at least 1 minute before shaving. This allows it to do its job.

, Don't push the razor into your skin when you shave; the razor’s weight should be enough pressure to take off the hair. Additionally, shave with the direction of the hair. Though the shave won’t be as close, this will significantly reduce irritation – particularly since a too-close shave is what encourages ingrown hairs in the first place.

Avoid products containing alcohol.,
Apply cool water or an ice pack.,
Avoid shaving that area for a while.,
Ask your dermatologist about Yttrium-Aluminum-Garnet laser treatment.",How to Treat Razor Burn2," The aloe vera allows for protection from the environment and has analgesic qualities that reduce swelling, soothe the irritation, and form a barrier which protects the skin from infection and promotes healing.

, In controlled studies, this has caused a 60% reduction in lesions and even allowed participants to continue shaving daily with minimal irritation., Though it’s more commonly thought of as an anti-acne treatment, it has also been shown to treat razor burn.

, Alcohol dries out skin and further clogs pores.

, This can soothe the area by reducing inflammation.

, The most sure-fire way to overcome razor burn is to let the hair grow out. As you do this, keep the skin clean and exfoliated to prevent clogging the pores and further encouraging ingrown hairs.

, If this is a serious issue, you may want to take more stringent measures. Controlled studies have shown that laser treatments can significantly reduce razor bumps for months."

Take your cat to the vet.,
Discuss your cat's condition with the veterinarian.,
Begin treatment with an antibiotic.,
Give your cat an anti-fungal medication.,
Apply an anti-parasitic medication.",How to Treat Skin Inflammation in Cats1," If you have identified areas of inflammation on your cat's body, you should have it looked at by a veterinarian. This is especially true if the areas of inflammation are obviously causing your cat pain or are open wounds.Call your veterinary office and tell them about your cat's symptoms. Ask for an appointment as soon as possible, so that your cat's discomfort can be soothed. However, skin inflammation is not usually a life-threatening medical emergency, so waiting a day or so for your cat to be seen is reasonable.;
, When you bring your cat to be seen by a veterinarian, they are likely to ask you all about your cat's symptoms. Give them all the information that you have, including when you first noticed the inflammation. Once the vet looks at the cat, gives it a thorough exam, and comes up with a diagnosis, you can discuss the case further and ask any questions you have. Some conditions that might be causing your cat's skin inflammation include:Flea infestation
Seasonal Allergies
Food allergies
Eosinophilic granuloma complex (which is a skin issue caused by an abnormal immune response)
Ringworm
Environmental factors (for example, the chemicals used in your home)

, Depending on what is causing the skin inflammation on your cat, treatments will vary. However, veterinarians will likely prescribe some sort of topical antibiotic to clear up any infections on the skin's surface.Follow your veterinarian's directions for how to and how long you should apply this medication.
Common antibiotics that might be prescribed include Thiostrepton, bacitracin, gentamicin sulfate, neomycin sulfate, and polymyxin B., Your veterinarian may prescribe an anti-fungal medication to treat your cat's skin inflammation if they think that it is caused by a fungus. For example, if your cat has a ringworm infection, your veterinarian will likely prescribe a topical anti-fungal medication, such as miconazole or thiabendazole.Anti-fungal drugs can be administered on the outside of the body, such as in the form of a shampoo, or systemically, in pill form., Parasites are also common causes of skin inflammation, so your veterinarian may prescribe a anti-parasitic medication to eliminate this kind of infection. For instance, if your cat has a flea infestation, your veterinarian will prescribe an anti-parasitic flea medication for the cat. Your cat's skin irritation could also be caused by other parasites, such as mites, which would also be treated with an anti-parasitic medication.

Don't allow the cat to touch the area.,
Soothe irritation.,
Consider dietary changes.",How to Treat Skin Inflammation in Cats2," An area of skin inflammation needs to be left alone in order to heal. However, your cat will likely continue to lick and clean the area as long as it is allowed to. With this in mind, your veterinarian will likely suggest that a cone, otherwise known as an e-collar or Elizabethan collar, be put on the cat so that it cannot disturb the area while it is being treated.


Keeping a cone on your cat can be very disconcerting but it is better for it to have a little temporary discomfort than an actual risk to its health.

, If your cat has inflamed skin, there are ways you can soothe it at home. Your veterinarian may suggest using an oatmeal shampoo on the area or a medicated lotion that can relieve itching and irritation. Even a warm water compress applied to the irritated area can provide some relief.Follow your veterinarian's suggestions about treatment of irritation. Depending on the cause of the irritation, you may want to use different solutions.

, If your cat is suffering from inflammation due to food allergies, you may need to change its diet in order to get rid of its skin inflammation. Consult with your veterinarian about what type of food you should be giving your cat, and remember to transition your cat to new food slowly.Special diets for cats with food allergies can be more expensive than other types of cat foods. However, it is important to feed them to cats with severe allergies so that their symptoms can be reduced.

Notice behaviors associated with skin inflammation.,
Look for areas of skin inflammation.,
Differentiate between skin disease and simple irritation.",How to Treat Skin Inflammation in Cats3," Many times a cat owner first notices a skin problem because their cat is itching or licking areas of its body incessantly. If your cat is doing this, you should have a closer look at the area your cat is focusing on.Your cat may also be chewing on areas still covered in fur. Even though there is still fur present, this does not rule out a problem underneath with the cat's skin.

, Skin inflammation can usually be spotted when petting your cat or giving it a home health exam. Take the time to inspect your cat's whole body, in order to locate areas of concern. Inflamed areas of skin may have:Redness
Swelling of the skin
Loss of fur
Scabby, scaly, or flaky skin
Bumps on the skin

, If you have identified that your cat has an area of inflamed skin, you should then assess its severity and whether or not it gets worse. Watch for healing in the area over the course of several days to determine if the inflammation is simply a random and temporary irritation or not.


In order for any kind of irritation to heal, your cat needs to leave it alone. Consider putting a cone on your cat for a few days to see if the inflamed area clears up once it is no longer licked or gnawed at. If you don't, the cat can cause further problems by creating wounds or abrasions in the area of irritation."

Wash the area periodically with antibacterial soap.,
Soak the area with warm water and aluminum acetate.,
Treat with oatmeal.,
Try a simple salt water compress.,
Consider using a holistic cure like vinegar.",How to Treat Folliculitis1," Most mild cases of folliculitis will eventually go away on their own. However, it's possible to speed this process by taking good care of the infected area. Twice a day, use a gentle antibacterial soap to cleanse the infected area and kill any folliculitis-causing bacteria.Rinse and dry with a clean, dry washcloth or towel.


Be sure to wash gently. Don't use a harsh soap or scrub roughly - these things can irritate the area, worsening any redness and inflammation.
If you happen to have folliculitis on your face, choose an antibacterial soap that's specifically labeled for facial use. These are often gentler than run-of-the-mill antibacterial soaps.;
, Also known as Burow's solution, aluminum acetate is an astringent and antibacterial that is commonly used as a cheap over-the-counter treatment for a variety of minor skin conditions. Aluminum acetate can be used to kill folliculitis-causing bacteria and to reduce swelling in the infected area, lessening irritation and speeding recovery.To use Burow's solution, simply dissolve one packet in the recommended amount of warm water. Soak a clean washcloth in the aluminum acetate solution, wring it out, and then apply to the affected area gently. Hold the washcloth there, intermittently wetting the cloth in the acetate solution as needed.
When done, clean out the receptacle used for the aluminum acetate and run the washcloth under cool water. Do not re-use the washcloth; clean and dry it thoroughly before re-using.

, Believe it or not, oatmeal has long been used as an ingredient in home remedies for skin irritations due to its anti-itching properties. Try soaking your body (or just the affected area) in a homemade oatmeal bath or covering the area with an oatmeal lotion. Enjoy the gentle soothing sensation of your oatmeal cure, but, to avoid aggravating your folliculitis further, avoid prolonged exposure to even these mild solutions.


As above, be sure to use a clean towel or washcloth to gently dry the affected area.

, Warm compresses are rags or other absorbent materials soaked in warm liquid and held against the affected area to sooth irritation, promote drainage, and speed the healing process. Using salt water for your compress conveys an added antibacterial benefit (albeit a minor one). To create a salt water compress, first dissolve a few spoonfuls of table salt in a cup or two of warm water. Soak a clean cotton ball or washcloth in the salt water and hold it gently against the affected area.


Apply twice a day — once in the morning, once at night.

, Minor skin ailments like folliculitis are easy targets for a wide variety of holistic or ""natural"" cures. Some practitioners swear by these types of cures, though they are often not supported by the medical establishment. If you decide to use a holistic cure, use common sense - don't do anything that's likely to aggravate your folliculitis, introduce additional bacteria to the affected area, or prevent healing. One common holistic cure involving vinegar is described below (many others can be found with a simple online search).


Make a solution of two parts warm water to one part white vinegar and mix thoroughly. Soak a clean washcloth in the vinegar solution, wring out, and apply to affected area. Hold the compress in place for 5-10 minutes, intermittently wetting the cloth in the vinegar solution as needed.

Don't hesitate to consult a doctor for serious cases.,
Use hydrocortisone to ease the itch and dull the pain.,
Use over-the-counter painkillers/anti-inflammatories.,
Use antibiotics for serious cases.,
Use antifungals for cases caused by fungus.,
Have any boils or carbuncles drained by medical professionals.",How to Treat Folliculitis2," Usually, folliculitis amounts to nothing more than a minor (albeit painful) irritation. However, like all infections, there is always the chance that it can develop into something more serious if left unchecked. If your folliculitis doesn't seem to be improving on its own or you develop more serious symptoms like fever or severe swelling and irritation, schedule a doctor appointment as soon as possible. It's much better to be safe than sorry - a timely doctor's visit can potentially save you lots of time and money in the long run.


Usually, it's fine to see your ""normal"" doctor (i.e. your family/general practitioner). S/he may subsequently refer you to a dermatologist.

, Hydrocortisone is a topical cream that treats skin irritation and relieves itchiness.Try a 1% hydrocortisone cream 2 to 5 times a day (or as needed) to dull the pain. Apply the ointment directly to the affected area, gently rubbing it in with your fingers or a clean applicator. If using your hands, wash and dry your hands before applying to ointment to avoid transferring bacteria into the wound.


Note that, although the hydrocortisone will dull the pain and inflammation, it will not actively fight the bacteria.

, To ease the pain and inflammation associated with folliculitis, you may want to use any one of the wide variety of over-the-counter medicines suitable for treating this condition. Cheap, common painkillers like acetaminophen and aspirin can help reduce mild cases of pain caused by folliculitis. Pain-reducing drugs with an anti-inflammatory function such as ibuprofen are also great choices, as these drugs will not only help with the pain but also temporarily ease the inflammation contributing to the pain.


Though most over-the-counter painkillers are very safe in small doses, heavy or prolonged use can sometimes lead to serious conditions like liver damage, so always follow the directions for safe use included with any medicines you purchase.

, For cases of folliculitis that don't respond well to home cleaning and care, it may be necessary to treat the underlying bacterial infection with antibiotics. Topical antibiotics are available at most pharmacies and grocery stores. More powerful oral antibiotics, however, usually require a doctor's prescription and are usually reserved for severe cases.

, As noted in the introduction, some cases of folliculitis are caused not by bacteria but by a fungus. In these cases, you'll want to use an antifungal medication to treat your condition. Antifungals are available in both oral and topical form. As with antibacterials, mild antifungals are often sold over-the-counter, while stronger medications may require a prescription.

, In particularly severe cases, folliculitis can eventually contribute to painful, pus-filled blisters and carbuncles. If you have these boils, see a doctor. While draining these boils will speed the healing process and reduce eventual scarring,you will not want to do so on your own. Attempting to lance and drain boils without the benefit of a sterile medical environment is a sure-fire way to develop a secondary infection.

Don't shave the area.,
Don't touch the area.,
Don't wear tight clothing.,
Don't expose your skin to irritating substances.,
Don't bathe or swim in untreated water.,
Don't rely too heavily on topical steroid creams.,
Don't let existing wounds get infected.",How to Treat Folliculitis3," Folliculitis is often brought on by irritation caused by shaving or unsanitary shaving practices. If you have folliculitis on the skin under your beard or another area that you regularly shave, give that area a break from shaving. Persistent shaving can irritate the area and even spread the disease from one patch of hair to the next.


If you must shave, minimize the irritation as much as possible. Try to use an electric razor, rather than a handheld razor, and shave with the grain, rather than against the grain. Ensure your razor is clean every time you shave.

, Fingers and hands are among the most common vectors for bacteria. This means that they carry and transmit bacteria much like an airplane carries and transmits people. Although the area may itch, sting, or smart, it's important to resist the urge to itch or pick at the infected area. Treat the area like an off-limits area - try to touch it only if you're applying soap, topical medicine, or a compress.

, The mechanical action of clothing rubbing against the skin throughout the day can cause chafing and irritation which can potentially lead to infection. Additionally, skin infections can also result if any clothing prevents air from reaching the skin. If you are prone to folliculitis, ensure that your clothing is soft and loose-fitting to minimize any potential irritation.


Also try to prevent the clothing around any areas affected by folliculitis from becoming wet. Wet clothing is likely to cling to the skin, increasing the risk of irritation.

, Everyone's skin is different - some people are susceptible to rashes and breakouts, while others are resilient. If you have folliculitis (or are prone to it), try to avoid coming into contact with any substances that you know to cause you irritation (especially substances you're allergic to), as the irritation can lead to an infection or sidetrack the healing process of an existing infection.


You may, for instance, want to avoid certain cosmetics, oils, lotions, rubs, and so on.

, Folliculitis is colloquially called ""hot tub rash"" for good reason. Swimming, bathing, or otherwise submerging yourself in unclean water, such as hot tub water that hasn't been treated with chlorine, is a common way to receive a folliculitis infection. Certain folliculitis-causing bacteria, like Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are easily transmitted via dirty water.If you're prone to folliculitis, you'll want to take care to ensure that you don't allow yourself to come into contact with stagnant, untreated water.

, Certain medical treatments, when used for long periods of time, can lead to an increased risk for folliculitis. Topical steroid creams like hydrocortisone, in particular, can contribute to folliculitis infections. Paradoxically, topical hydrocortisone is itself a common treatment for mild folliculitis. If you're using hydrocortisone to treat your folliculitis, schedule a doctor's appointment if you don't notice any improvement - procrastinating and over-relying on steroid creams can cause the infection to worsen.

, Hair follicles can become inflamed and infected if a nearby infection is irritated or allowed to spread. Thus, you'll want to ensure you treat any skin infections promptly and professionally. Don't let infections get out of hand - they are much easier to treat when they're small and localized than after they spread.

These are available in many skin and hygiene stores, some grocery stores, and online.

, Many soaps contain harsh chemicals that can irritate the skin and make psoriasis worse. Therefore, it’s important that you choose hypoallergenic soaps which contain mild ingredients. A mild soap and warm water will help keep your condition from getting worse.


Examples of mild soaps include Aveeno cleansing bars, Nivea cream bars, or phisoderm soaps.

, Apple cider vinegar contains its own healing, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fungal properties. It is also known to treat burns and skin inflammations. You can soak the affected body part in a mixture of equal parts apple cider vinegar and water.


You can also use cotton balls to apply ACV to the skin. Just pour small amounts of apple cider vinegar to the cotton balls and directly apply to affected areas.
You can do this twice per day until patches and redness have improved. If your skin gets easily irritated refrain from using this method, as apple cider vinegar is quite acidic.

, If you have an aloe vera plant at home you can just slice one of its leaves horizontally and apply the gel-like sap directly onto the plaque. This will smooth and naturally moisturize dry scaly patches.


You can also purchase aloe gel in local pharmacies and grocery stores.
Apply 3 times a day or more, depending on the dryness of the patches.

, Sunlight exposure is the simplest yet one of the most effective methods of treating plaque psoriasis. Try exposing affected body parts to sunlight for 10 minutes of noontime sun every day and gradually increase the exposure time by 30 seconds each day.


Take precautions as heat from sunlight causes sunburns. If you choose to expose yourself to sunlight don’t apply any cream as this can make you more sensitive to heat but you should apply sunscreens to unaffected areas.
If you expose the affected skin to sunlight on a consistent daily basis, you will gradually notice your symptoms improving over time.

, Coal tar is an effective treatment for plaque psoriasis. It is made of coal and wood and helps to reduce inflammation, remove scales, and slow the growth of excess skin cells.


Coal tar penetrates layers of the skin and reduces excessive thickening and scaling of the skin – it does this by breaking down a protein named keratin, which is responsible for skin growth and formation.
This is also an OTC drug/ointment/cream that can be bought in most pharmacies. The greater the concentration of this product, the more it is effective.
Tar shampoo can be particularly good for treating plaque on the scalp.

, Soaking yourself in a tub or showering can help to moisturize and hydrate your skin, as well as softening and removing scaly patches.

, Oatmeal contains saponins that are healthy for the skin. It also has anti-inflammatory properties that are also good for other skin problems.

, This oil contains glycerin, which works very well for dry skin. Dry skin can make the itching and redness worse which is why it is important to keep skin well hydrated. You can pour ½ cup of vegetable oil in the tub and soak your body for 10 minutes to reap its benefits.


Rinse using mild soap and water and apply moisturizer afterward, as usual. The residue of the vegetable oil should not be left on your skin.

, This is an ingredient found in cayenne pepper that is responsible for making chili peppers hot. Capsaicin blocks the nerve endings that produce pain – in other words, it helps resolve itching and heals plaque psoriasis.

It will cause a burning sensation when applied to plaque and it usually takes 1 week for it to work. However, generally it is effective.

, This treatment contains keratolytic properties that help peel the outermost layer of the skin and help remove scales and dead skin cells. This is found in many products such as creams, shampoos, gel, and ointments. You can buy any topical cream containing salicylic acid.

, Anthralin (Drithocreme 0.1%, 0.25% HP, Micanol 1%) is useful for chronic extensor surface plaque and scalp problems. With the short-contact method, the patient applies the medication and washes off in 20 minutes. The Dithranol remains on the epidermis in small quantities after washing.


The medication should be confined to the plaque. It may cause redness and irritation in otherwise healthy skin.

, Tazarotene (Tazorac) gel 0.05% and 0.1% can be used topically once per night. The medication should be confined to the plaque. Ask your doctor if this is a viable option for you.


Topical steroids are applied once a day to control irritation which is a side effect of Tazorac.

, Phototherapy is usually an effective treatment for psoriasis. Ultraviolet light may be used in combination with topical treatment. Ultraviolet B (UVB) is typically given 3 to 5 times a week. These are wavelengths found in natural sunlight and are administered in carefully measured doses from light sources.


Narrow band UVB is even more effective in rapidly clearing psoriatic plaques. Tar and lubricants enhance the effectiveness of UVB. Side effects include sun burning and premature skin aging.
Psoralen plus ultraviolet (PUVA) requires therapy three times a week until the condition resolves and then it is tapered off. Patients take photosensitizing agent psoralen 1½ to 2 hours before exposure to UVA.
Patients must wear dark glasses during treatment and for 24 hours thereafter.This treatment is used for symptomatic control of severe, recalcitrant, disabling plaque psoriasis.

, Excimer laser uses high intensity beams of UVB rays (Ultraviolet light B) that treat psoriasis plaques. This method of treatment is approved by the Food and Drug Administrators (FDA). It is reserved for severe cases of psoriasis and must come recommended by your doctor.


It usually takes 4 to 10 sessions until improvement is seen.

, If all these treatments do not respond to you, you will be advised to take drugs that act throughout the body. These drugs will be prescribed by your doctor and will help in reducing inflammation, suppressing the immune system and will reduce production of skin cells.


Common medications recommended are methotrexate, hydroxyurea, retinoids, and cyclosporine.

, Methotrexate is very useful to control severe plaque psoriasis. It is given orally, intramuscularly or subcutaneously. The regimen should be worked up to a dose of 12.5 to 50 mg/week.


Folic acid, 1 mg/day, is also given but not on the day that MTX is administered. This medication requires close follow-ups including monitoring of the complete blood count and liver function tests.

, Superficial scales are removed with salicylic acid or tar shampoos. Just like salicylic acid can help the psoriasis on your skin, it can be effective on the scalp, too. And it won't damage your hair, either.

, Diffuse scalp scales can be removed with fluocinolone (Derma-Smoothe/FS) lotion at bedtime and washed out in the morning. This regimen should be repeated for 5 to 10 days. It removes the scales and controls inflammation.


Try applying other ointments at bedtime, too. Phenol, sodium chloride and liquid paraffin (Baker P and S) can be applied at bedtime and washed out in the morning.

, Hot olive-oil turbans also help remove very thick scaling. They are just what they sound like – your scalp doused in olive oil, wrapped in one or two wet, hot towels. Leave them wrapped around your head for 30 minutes to fight psoriasis.


You can repeat this treatment as often as you'd like or as often as your doctor recommends.

, Steroid solutions and gels penetrate through the hair and into the scales. Common brand names are Cormax, Luxiq, Lidex, Temovate, Topicort. They are available at certain pharmacies, online, or through your doctor.

Repeat them once or twice a day and this may strengthen your neck so that it appears firmer.Place one hand on your forehead. Push your head against it without letting it go forwards. You should feel your neck muscles working. Hold this position for about 10 seconds. Then clasp your hands behind your head, and push backwards to create pressure, and again hold for about ten seconds.
Sit down with your back straight. Lift your head back so that your chin is pointing toward the ceiling with your lips closed. Next make a chewing motion with your mouth. You'll feel your neck and facial muscles being worked. Repeat about 20 times.Again, sit with a straight back and lift your head so that your chin points to the ceiling with your lips together. This time, pout your lips in a sort of kissing motion. Repeat this exercise twice. This may feel similar to the first exercise, but actually works different parts of your neck and face.Be careful with this one because it could strain your neck. Lie on the bed with your head hanging over the edge. Slowly and carefully lift your head up towards your torso, using your neck. Slowly and carefully lower it back down. Repeat this about 5 times. Stop immediately if you feel any pain.;
, Certain facial movements and expressions, such as tilting your head in disagreement, can weaken adjacent muscles.

Set up a consistent wash schedule.,
Use a special facial soap.,
Use the right water temperature.",How to Treat Oily Skin1," Oily skin becomes more oily often for two reasons: you wash your skin too often, or not enough. Washing your face too often dries out your skin, causing your body to try to compensate by creating more oil. Washing your face infrequently causes old oil to build up. Find a happy medium by washing your face twice daily; when you wake up and before you go to bed is the best time.






;
, Some soaps dry out your skin too much, causing your face to create more oil while others contain ingredients that clog pores and create more oil as well. Find a facial soap - bar or liquid, it doesn’t matter - that is made especially for oily skin. For extremely oily skin, a detergent facial soap may be considered, but this may be too harsh and dry out your skin too much.

, When you’re washing your face, use hot water; this will break down the oil more effectively than cold or warm water is able to. Hot water also opens your pores, making it easier to clear out the excess oil. When you finish washing your face, splash it with ice cold water. This will close up the pores and tighten the skin, keeping it clear of oil and grime for longer."
